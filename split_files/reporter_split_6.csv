Diagnosing fungal infections faces a number of challenges including a decline in expertise needed for
identifying fungi and a reduced number of instruments and assays specific for fungal identification compared
to bacteria and viruses. These problems are exacerbated by the fact that patients with fungal infections are
often immunosuppressed, which predisposes them to infections from both common and rarely seen fungi.
Historically, molecular diagnostic assays for invasive infections have been labor intensive and required a high
degree of technical expertise. Developing an efficient assay that could use technology as a substitute for
classical mycology expertise has been difficult. While ribosomal ITS sequencing is the gold standard of fungal
molecular diagnostics, it is slow, requires high capital costs, and for many fungi, is not specific enough. This
study will rely on two innovative components that will enable the identification of almost any fungus to the
species level quickly. The first component is a new sequencing technology called nanopore sequencing,
which is fast and inexpensive. The second component will consist of a novel sequencing target called the
intergenic spacer sequence (IGS), which is located within the fungal ribosomal repeat. The IGS is too long to
be covered by traditional Sanger sequencing in a diagnostic assay because multiple reads generated from a
primer walk would be required, so it is not used for fungal identification. However, nanopore sequencing can
easily cover the IGS region in a single sequencing run. To achieve the goal of developing an efficient pan
fungal diagnostic strategy, three aims will test the hypothesis that sequencing a little used, but highly
informative region of the fungal rDNA repeat locus using nanopore sequencing will provide the greatest
specificity and quickest turnaround time to date for fungal identification. These aims are: 1) Generation of a
fungal intergenic spacer sequence reference sequence database within the GenBank RefSeq (reference
sequence) Targeted Loci Project, called the Fungal IGS RefSeq database 2), Development of a rapid assay
for fungal identification based on nanopore sequencing of the intergenic spacer sequence, 3) Comparison of
a nanopore sequence diagnostic assay against current laboratory fungal diagnostic methods. The long-term
goal that this project will enable after its completion will be the future development of a rapid, inexpensive,
assay that is pan fungal in capability."

The United States is facing an opiate epidemic that is spiraling out of control, with a recent CDC report finding
that drug overdoses kill one and a half times more people annually than motor vehicle accidents. This epidemic
has been driven, in part, by the high prevalence of chronic pain conditions. The interconnected problems of
chronic pain and the opiate epidemic are expected to persist and even worsen in the short term. Given these
complex and deadly challenges, patients and medical providers are in desperate need of solutions.
Simultaneously, the wide availability of medical and recreational cannabis has increased dramatically within
the past decade as a result of legalization in 2 states. Data suggest that management of chronic pain is a
driving motivation among medical cannabis users, and recent studies suggest that medical cannabis users
report cannabis to be more effective at managing pain as compared to opiates. As a result, pain patients are
increasingly turning to cannabis as a form of treatment. At the same time, highly respected institutions like the
National Academy of Sciences have published systematic reviews indicating that there is substantial evidence
that cannabis products are actually effective in the treatment of pain. Despite the burgeoning body of evidence
that supports the idea that cannabis may play a helpful role in the chronic pain and opiate epidemic,
prospective studies on the effectiveness and safety profile of cannabis as a treatment for reducing
opiate use are virtually non-existent in the U.S. The proposed research is timely and would address a
glaring gap in the knowledge base in ways that could potentially have an important public health impact. In light
of the current legal climate prohibiting a traditional randomized controlled trial with legal market cannabis
products, we propose a patient-centered and highly innovative adaptive intervention design to examine the
effectiveness of the cannabis products that patients are already using to reduce reliance on opiates. Consistent
with federal laws, we will not be involved in the dispensing of the products and we will not direct the
administration or dosing of the products. Our overarching aim is to compare three broad classes of orally
administered products (i.e., “edibles”): a THC only product, a product that has a 1:1 THC to CBD ratio, and a
CBD only product over the course of 12 weeks in a sample of individuals who want to reduce their opiate use
and plan to use cannabis to do so. The primary clinical outcome is opiate use reduction, and the secondary
outcome is pain control. We will also conduct acute laboratory sessions in our mobile pharmacology lab to
directly examine mechanisms that may mediate the effect of the cannabis products on the clinical outcomes."

 Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is now the most common malignancy of the head and neck region, and
OPC associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) has overtaken cervical cancer as the most common HPV-
associated malignancy in the United States. African American (AA) patients demonstrate inferior OPC oncologic
outcomes to their non-AA counterparts even when adjusting for HPV effect. It is not known whether reduced
treatment response and survival in AA OPC patients is driven solely by unequitable access to care and other
socio-economic variables or whether it is impacted at least partially by the interaction between ancestry and
cancer biology. No previous study has addressed this question using an adequate OPC clinical dataset with
correlative genomic and transcriptomic data in order to address this translationally important question. Therefore,
it is not possible to determine whether OPC treatment response and survival in AA patients is partially linked to
differential tumor biology using existing datasets.
 In this application, we will utilize two unique OPC cohorts enriched for AA patients to test the hypothesis
that OPC development in AA patients is accompanied by more aggressive tumor biology facilitated by an
immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). In Aim 1 we will correlate self-reported race and
calculated ancestry to intrinsic OPC tumor biology and treatment response. Specifically, we will test the
correlation between tumor cell multi-nucleation (a feature of aggressive OPC biology recently validated by our
team in a multi-institutional OPC cohort), survival, and differential gene expression in AA OPC patients matched
to their non-AA counterparts for T classification, HPV status, and smoking history. In Aim 2 we will correlate self-
reported race and calculated ancestry to changes in TIME and treatment response in previously untreated AA
OPC patients as well as immune checkpoint inhibitor response in AA OPC patients with recurrent/metastatic
disease. For both sets of analyses, we will deploy novel, validated machine learning approaches to analysis of
conventional histologic slides designed to facilitate rapid clinical translation across multiple other institutions.
 Completion of the proposed studies will, for the first time, establish the link between race/ancestry, OPC
biological behavior, and treatment response. Successful validation of our hypothesis will provide a unique
opportunity for the development of precision oncology approaches to AA OPC management aimed at reversing
the disparities noted in cancer specific survival for this understudied patient population."

 The liver has emerged as a promising target for expressing therapeutic transgenes
utilizing Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) vector-mediated delivery. Despite numerous clinical trials
and continued progress several challenges have been identified for AAV gene therapy. In this
proposal we will dissect a major clinical hurdle, e.g. AAV transgene silencing in the human liver
and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. To achieve such, we first propose to
utilize and characterize a novel humanized liver model, which will allow precise and selective
interrogation of the mechanisms underlying AAV transgene silencing in normal as well as
diseased human hepatocytes in vivo. The second aim will build on a recent observation from
our lab showing AAV transgene expression mediated by the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH)
complex. We will further dissect and gather mechanistic inside on this process using human
hepatocytes from methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) patients in vivo. Hence MMA will serve as a
proof of concept disorder for liver directed AAV gene therapy. Finally, we will explore different
vector design and pharmacological strategies to rescue AAV gene silencing."

This is a new Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) T32 application to support graduate training
at Emory University. The proposed training leverages activities that support an established IMSD combined
graduate/undergraduate program but adds innovative components focused on successful graduate training to
achieve the goal of developing a diverse pool of scientists earning a PhD, who have the skills to successfully
transition into careers in the biomedical research workforce. Graduate training opportunities at Emory include a
broad array of biomedical, public health, computational and other STEM disciplines. This breadth is achieved
through interdisciplinary research training in one of many possible graduate programs within the Laney Graduate
School (LGS). An interdisciplinary academic culture and environment coupled with extensive expertise in STEM
research makes Emory a fertile environment for training the next generation of scientific leaders. This ambitious
proposed T32 will support students during Year 1 and 2 of training in one of 17-participating graduate programs
that span a set of eight (8) interdisciplinary graduate programs in the Graduate Division of Biological and
Biomedical Sciences (GDBBS), six (6) programs in the Rollins School of Public Health (RSPH), two (2) programs
in Emory College of Arts and Sciences (ECAS), and one (1) in concert with the Emory School of Medicine (SOM).
IMSD activities are designed to complement program-specific activities to avoid increased demand on IMSD
T32-supported students. The primary activity supporting the proposed IMSD training is a one-credit Professional
Development Seminar, which strives to build an inclusive community that bolsters scientific identity, provides
skills-based learning to supplement discipline-based training, and provides access to professional development
and networking opportunities. Other IMSD training activities include a pre-enrollment orientation session and
requirements for both quantitative and scientific writing courses during the two years of T32 support, with
continued engagement throughout graduate training via annual check-in meetings with IMSD leadership and a
yearly IMSD retreat and symposium. Innovative aspects of the program include an MPI leadership team that
brings distinct skills to student training while also providing representation of the different invested Emory units
(ECAS, RSPH, SOM) as well as leadership demonstrating the commitment of the graduate school in dedicated
effort from the Associate Dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Community Engagement. A full-time IMSD Assistant
Director brings key experience, including a PhD in STEM and formal training in STEM education, to the
leadership. This structure allows individualized attention to the success and wellbeing of students as they
matriculate through graduate training and chart their path to the PhD. Furthermore, the T32 mandates annual
mentor training for ALL faculty advisors to build an inclusive research environment. The depth of the pool of
admitted students who would be eligible for this T32 combined with the track record of training and the potential
for further enhanced impact within Emory provides a strong rationale for this proposed training program."

The University of Notre Dame (ND) proposes to create a cross-university Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program
(ND-PREP) to provide a one year pre-PhD research experience for eight post-baccalaureate Fellows from underserved
diverse backgrounds. Through a combination of NIH support (six Fellows) and institutional funds (two Fellows), Fellows
will have the opportunity to choose a research laboratory associated with any of the biomedical-associated PhD
programs at ND. The specific sponsoring PhD programs are the Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Biophysics, Chemistry,
and Integrated Biomedical Sciences (IBMS) programs in the College of Science, Bioengineering in the College of
Engineering, and the Anthropology and Psychology PhD programs in the College of Arts and Letters. The goal of ND-
PREP is to provide Fellows with the research experience, professional development, and life skills necessary to gain
admission to and succeed in competitive biomedical PhD programs and to do so in an environment that is rigorous
while also being individualized, interactive (with both peers and mentors), positive, constructive, and supportive. This
goal will be achieved by providing the Fellows with a three-part formal training program that includes: 1) an intensive
in-laboratory research experience (75% of Fellow time); (2) a set of skills-development workshops and enrichment
activities that will also serve to build a strong ND-PREP cohort (15% of Fellow time, with workshops ranging from
research ethics to life skills); and (3) Fellow participation in a unique community engagement activity (10% of Fellow
time). The skills-development workshops and enrichment activities will begin with an intensive Summer Graduate School
and Research Readiness Bootcamp followed by ND-PREP cohort weekly meetings throughout the academic year. Each
ND-PREP Fellow will gain further professional development by attending regional or national conferences. A unique
aspect of the ND-PREP program will be participation of Fellows in existing community outreach activities focused on
lead abatement. Beyond professional development training, each ND-PREP Fellow will have a mosaic of formal and
informal mentors who will provide more personalized training and mentorship. ND-PREP participants will apply to PhD
programs (including but not limited to ND) in the fall semester, after participating in writing workshops specifically
focused on writing competitive applications that highlight their strengths. Significantly, the set of Fellows who were
initially identified through the PhD program application process and who successfully complete the ND-PREP program
will be directly admitted to the PhD program that originally nominated them.Through the three-part training program
provided by ND-PREP, Fellows should gain the foundational research experience, professional development, and life skills
necessary for a life-long career in biomedical research."

expand the portfolio of genetic and genomics assays available to the PPG. In the context of expanding roles, we
propose to transition primary core activities from UCLA (Geschwind) to UCSF (Yokoyama). We will continue
sample collection and banking and will expand our sequencing and genotyping efforts to include whole exome
sequencing for gene screening, genome-wide SNP arrays for population mapping, fragment analysis for disease-
causing trinucleotide repeat expansions, and transcriptomics in support of Project ൭: Molecular Biomarkers. Such
data will be integrated with the clinical, imaging, biomarker, and neuropathological studies being conducted within
the PPG to advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of neurodegenerative disease. Given the
fundamental nature of genetic information in the etiology and pathophysiology of FTD, this core serves all the

There is a pressing need for nutrition-focused, methodologically sound, Evidence-Based Health
Care (EBHC) skills training across the field of nutrition including the clinical interface. Emerging
evidence points to largely low-quality systematic reviews informing clinical practice and policy in
nutrition. While numerous successful models of EBHC skills training exist for physicians, these
programs are not sufficient for nutrition trainees. Modified trainings are needed due to the sheer
number of nutrition trainees and the unique challenges within nutrition such as limited
randomized controlled trial data, observational study confounding, and the challenges of dose-
response meta-analyses, dietary recall, adherence and quality among other issues. We’ve
assembled a strong leadership team located on the East Coast, West Coast, and in the South,
with a distinct portfolio of research, teaching and administrative skills to collaborate on this
initiative entitled Evidence-based Nutrition Education and Research Guidance (ENER-G). Our
overall objective is to implement, evaluate, and disseminate rigorous, nutrition-focused, EBHC
training and research experiences for both conventional and integrative nutritional
science trainees and professionals. In order to meet our objective, we have developed three
specific aims.
Aim 1: Deliver a nutrition-focused systematic review and meta-analysis course with a built-in
mentored research experience (from initiation to publication);
Aim 2. Deliver nutrition-focused skills training workshops in EBHC principles and practice;
Aim 3. Deliver a semi-annual seminar series on the Nutrition Evidence Lifecycle addressing
epistemological issues and relevant topics in translational nutrition research.
We propose a 5-year program addressing the need for rigorous, innovative training in
systematic reviews and EBHC skills. This will be accomplished through courses, mentored
research experiences, workshops, and seminars across three primary, well-established, diverse
nutrition institutions and two additional prominent nutrition programs. We will further extend this
training to nutrition professionals and educators through continuing education and the SNAP-Ed
program. In so doing the ENER-G project will lead to much needed research and EBHC skills
sensitive to the Evidence Lifecycle. In total, ENER-G will train a large cohort of the next
generation of nutrition professionals and researchers (up to 1750 individuals over 5 years),
leading to a broad impact that supports patients and the strategic initiatives of the NIDDK."
10757713,"ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and its prevalence is expected to rise
with the aging of the general population. Myocardial infarction (MI), chronic cardiac overload or valvular diseases
often lead to the loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs). However, the limited endogenous proliferation capacity of adult
CM impedes CM renewal and contributes to the development of HF. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that
hypoxia promotes CM proliferation and improves recovery after myocardial injury, suggesting that endogenous
pathways involved in CM proliferation can be activated and are sufficient to induce CM renewal without genetic
manipulation in both healthy and diseased hearts. Therefore, promotion of endogenous CM renewal is a
promising therapeutic approach to treat HF. However, the mechanisms involved in hypoxia-induced CM
proliferation remain largely unknown. Prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) are widely considered as the
oxygen sensors. Whether PHDs are involved in hypoxia-induced CM proliferation and renewal is unknown. Further,
endothelial cells (ECs) act as the “first-responder” to environmental cues such as oxygen and nutrients. It is
unclear whether cardiac EC-CM communication plays a role in hypoxia-induced CM proliferation. Therefore,
exploring the role of endothelial PHDs in CM proliferation is of critical importance for understanding the basic
mechanisms involved in endogenous CM renewal and will provide us novel approaches to treat HF.
We have recently demonstrated that EC-specific knockout (eKO) of PHD2/3 promoted CM proliferation,
improved cardiac function, and prevented ventricular failure induced by MI. Mechanistically, we discovered that
yes-associated protein (YAP), a key player of organ size control and CM proliferation, was specifically activated
in CMs of PHD2/3 eKO mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that apelin (Apln), a
GPCR ligand, was markedly upregulated in cardiac ECs of PHD2/3 eKO mice via HIF-2a. We further
demonstrated that Apln potently activated YAP in CMs and promoted CM proliferation. Notably, deletion of HIF-
2a or Apln in ECs eliminated the beneficial effects on cardiac function observed in PHD2/3 eKO mice. More
importantly, CM-specific deletion of Apln receptor (AplnR) in mice at neonatal or adult stages inhibited YAP
activation and deteriorated heart function. These data lead us to hypothesize that an endothelial PHD-mediated
paracrine mechanism plays a key role in CM proliferation and renewal via Apln/AplnR pathway. To test this
hypothesis, we will elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism by which endothelial PHD-mediated paracrine
pathways regulate Hippo-YAP signaling in CMs. In addition, we will study the essential role of Apln/AplnR
pathway in CM proliferation and normal heart function. Last, we will investigate the role of Apln/AplnR pathway
in mouse models of heart failure."

 Metabolic dysfunction, manifested clinically as the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn), is a significant health
crisis in the US due to its high incidence and strong associations with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a robust molecular underpinning contributing to key aspects of the MetSyn. My
laboratory is keenly interested in the role that architecture remodeling plays in regulating mitochondrial
function and cellular insulin action. Mitochondrial remodeling is achieved by fission-fusion dynamics, and
impairment of these processes have been implicated in the pathobiology of metabolic disease and muscle
wasting during aging. However, the molecular links between mitochondrial remodeling muscle metabolism
and muscle mass are inadequately understood. We have previously shown the mitochondrial fission
incompetence mediated by impaired Drp1 signaling underlies derangements in metabolism and insulin
resistance. Herein we show that skeletal muscle-specific knockout of the mitochondrial fission regulator
Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (Drp1) reproduces features of the MetSyn, including glucose intolerance, fat
accumulation, and insulin resistance. We provide evidence that Drp1 colocalizes with succinate
dehydrogenase complex assembly factor 2 (Sdhaf2) to control oxidative metabolism. Moreover, we observed
a unique and dramatic muscle wasting phenotype along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion in the
inducible Drp1 knockout mouse model. I hypothesize that Drp1 is essential for the maintenance of muscle
metabolic function and mtDNA stability in part by its actions on succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/mitochondrial
complex II. This hypothesis will be tested using both constitutive and conditional muscle-specific Drp1 deletion
mice: mDrp1HET and miDrp1KO. In Aim 1, both cellular and animal studies will be employed to investigate the
effects of Drp1 deletion on mitochondrial function, muscle metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. In Aim 2, we will
determine the role of Drp1 in the regulation of SDH/complex II activity. In Aim 3, we will determine the
mechanisms of Drp1 in regulating skeletal muscle mtDNA copy number and muscle mass. These proposed
studies are of important translational relevance as the research will elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle and link defective mitochondrial dynamics with
features of MetSyn and type 2 diabetes mellitus-associated myopathy."
10830979,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite established sex differences in COPD epidemiology and clinical manifestations, most preventive and
therapeutic strategies do not take biologic sex into consideration. This is due, in large part, to a lack of
understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive these sex differences, as well as conceptual and
methodological gaps in incorporating sex into research and clinical practice. The involvement of X chromosome
genes in COPD has not been extensively studied, particularly incomplete X chromosome inactivation (XCI),
which causes gene dosage imbalance between sexes and sex-specific effects of genetic variation. Differences
related to sex chromosomes may allow genetic variations to have distinct functional effects in males and females.
Our hypothesis is that variations in X chromosome gene regulation affected by incomplete XCI, and X
chromosome genetic variants can help explain molecular mechanisms associated with sex differences
in COPD onset and heterogeneity. We will integrate X chromosome multi-omic data from lung and blood
samples from COPD cases and controls from three study populations (COPDGene, LTRC, and LTCOPD). We
will study sex-biased epigenetic regulation by methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis (Aim 1); sex-
biased genetic regulation by expression QTL analysis (Aim 2); and sex-biased regulatory processes via gene
regulatory network analysis (Aim 3). Our investigation would be the first to model the effect of XCI into gene
regulatory networks to examine sex divergent regulatory processes and the effect of genetic variants associated
with COPD status affection, emphysema, and lung function. We expect that our network analyses will point to
genetic variants that work together to influence biological function in a sex-specific manner. Given that genes
that escape XCI can vary across individuals and tissues and have been linked to disease susceptibility, we will
examine escape genes in the context of mQTL, eQTL, and regulatory networks, and test for changes between
COPD cases and controls. Identifying variations in XCI patterns in disease will give insights into the mechanisms
associated with both disease development and sex differences in COPD. These discoveries will help us better
understand the biological mechanisms of sex differences in COPD, and provide data for future functional
validation, and sex-aware development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. This K01 award will enable Dr.
Lopes-Ramos to build upon her existing molecular biology and transcriptomics-focused skill sets in order to learn
about epigenetics, statistical genetics, pulmonology, and integrative omic analysis and methods refinement for
sex-aware modeling and statistical comparisons. Dr. Lopes-Ramos has developed a detailed training plan and
assembled a mentoring team with complementary expertise. This K01 will allow the proposed research to be
completed successfully and will support the development of Dr. Lopes-Ramos into an independent researcher,
expert in integrative respiratory omics and network medicine."

This K08 mentored clinical scientist research career development award is a five-year program designed to
facilitate Dr. Marios Arvanitis’ (PI) development into an independent physician-investigator in vascular genetics.
 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a major public health burden that accounts for over
600,000 deaths in the United States each year. ASCVD is highly heritable and genome-wide association studies
have discovered many candidate genomic loci that increase the risk of the disease in the population, thereby
providing a window to novel therapies. However, most genomic risk loci for ASCVD remain unexplored in terms
of how they lead to disease risk.
 Previously published work by the PI has focused on the mechanistic interpretation of genomic risk loci
for cardiovascular disease, including the development of a novel Bayesian method, called CAFEH, to prioritize
the target tissue and genes in genomic loci. Our preliminary analyses of the genetic underpinnings of ASCVD
reveal that endothelial cells are enriched for ASCVD heritability, and we have used those methods to prioritize a
chromosome 4 locus that is predicted to affect ASCVD risk via altering the expression of the RE-1 silencing
transcription factor (REST) gene in endothelial cells. This K08 project will explore the regulatory mechanisms via
which the REST locus and gene influence the development of atherosclerosis. Aim 1 will employ CRISPR-Cas9
editing in human stem cells which will then be differentiated into endothelial cells to identify the causal variants
and the upstream transcription factors that mediate the association in the 4q12 coronary disease GWAS locus.
Aim 2 will define distal genes and pathways affected by REST in the endothelium and investigate their cellular
consequences, starting with evaluating the role of REST in endothelial to mesenchymal transition. Aim 3 will use
a tamoxifen inducible endothelial specific Rest knock-out mouse model to evaluate the in vivo effects of Rest in
the endothelium and atherosclerosis.
 The success of this project is guaranteed by the support of a multidisciplinary mentoring team including
a vascular biologist (Dr. Charles Lowenstein), a computational biologist (Dr. Alexis Battle), and a functional
genetics expert (Dr. Andrew McCallion), along with an advisory committee of experts in vascular biology, stem
cell differentiation and atherosclerosis (Dr. Harry Dietz, Dr. Chulan Kwon and Dr. Thomas Quertermous). This
award period will help the PI boost their genomics skills, acquire new wet lab skills and generate preliminary data
to successfully compete for R01 funding in order to translate the genetic insights into novel mechanisms for
ASCVD."
10766265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an unmet need in the HIV vaccine field for immunogens that consistently elicit potent serum antibodies
that neutralize a broad spectrum of HIV-1 variants in circulation worldwide. Recently, we identified a novel target
for human neutralizing antibodies (NAbs): the eight N-terminal amino acids of the fusion peptide (FP) on
prefusion HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer (Science 2016). We then created a novel immunization strategy: priming
with FP conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (FP-KLH) and boosting with HIV-1 Env
trimer. This strategy has reproducibly elicited FP-directed cross-reactive NAbs in multiple studies involving mice,
guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs), although not in every animal (Nat Med 2018, Cell 2019). The best
monoclonal antibody (mAb) from an immunized NHP neutralized 98% of 58 wild-type HIV-1 strains with FP
sequence matching the immunogen, and 59% of 208 strains that represent viruses worldwide and contain
diverse FP sequences. Therefore, FP prime/Env boost is a promising strategy for eliciting NAb responses. To
further improve FP-directed vaccine design, two main limitations need to be addressed. First, the neutralization
breadth of the polyclonal sera from immunized animal is still limited. Second, the cross-neutralizing activities
were only observed in a small subset of immunized animals and were generally low-titer. To address these
limitations, in this proposal, we will develop novel FP immunogens and immunization strategies to improve the
breadth (Aim 1), magnitude (Aim 2) and quality (Aim 3) of the FP-directed responses in guinea pigs and non-
human primates."
10798322,"Although there are high rates of abstinence among American Indians (AIs), there also is evidence of alcohol
and drug use disorders disproportionately affecting Native communities. As a result of generations of systemic
racism and historical trauma, AIs experience serious health disparities associated with substance use
disorders (SUDs). Effective treatments for SUD are critically needed for improving health equity in AI
communities, but there are few culturally grounded evidence-based interventions developed or tested with AIs.
With this study, Randomized Controlled Trial of Indigenous Recovery Planning for American Indians, we aim to
help fill this gap. Our research uses a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework to test the
efficacy of a culturally adapted relapse prevention intervention designed collaboratively by community partners
from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana and research partners from Montana State
University. Indigenous Recovery Planning (IRP) employs trained Fort Peck community members to deliver
manualized intervention content culturally adapted from Relapse Prevention (RP), one of the most studied and
efficacious treatments for SUD. Using data from 4 mixed-methods preliminary studies, we have worked closely
with a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to modify RP to focus on strengths, increase levels of protective
factors, address culturally specific risk factors, and overcome barriers to engagement in treatment. We now will
test the efficacy of IRP in a prospective randomized controlled trial with 150 tribal members with SUD using a
waitlist control group, a design desired by the community partners. Using random assignment to IRP
(immediate intervention; n = 75) or to a waitlist control group (delayed intervention; n = 75), we will test the
effects of IRP on primary outcomes (percent days abstinent) and secondary outcomes (substance-related
consequences, quality of life) assessed post-intervention. We also will examine maintenance of changes in
treatment outcomes at 12-week post-intervention follow-up, and examine hypothesized culturally specific
mediators of treatment effects (AI identity, spirituality, communal mastery, grief and loss, distress from
historical trauma, lateral violence, and racism) identified in our preliminary studies. Finally, we will conduct a
process evaluation to examine the acceptability and sustainability of the intervention to ensure that IRP
addresses barriers to evidence-based SUD interventions as designed. This research will fill an important gap in
scientific knowledge regarding the efficacy and acceptability of culturally adapted evidence-based treatments
tested in AI populations. This knowledge may be transferable to other communities with similar cultural values
and barriers to treatment. By increasing access to efficacious treatment, this research has the potential to
improve health outcomes and decrease SUD-related health disparities for underserved AI communities locally
and nationally."
10904643,"The proportion of pediatric emergency department or inpatient visits due to suicide-related behaviors (SRB)
has doubled in recent years. This public health emergency appears to be affecting youth of underrepresented
racial, ethnic, and linguistic backgrounds (i.e., REL minority youth) in particular. Trends in suicide attempts
over the past decade have remained higher or increased among Black and Latinx youth compared to white
peers. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) with electronic health records (EHR)
have advanced suicide risk identification, with potential to fill the need for sustainable and scalable practice-
based resources with near-term impact. Despite the near-term promise of ML and NLP with EHR data for
advancing suicide risk prediction, several important issues need to be addressed before ML-derived tools can
be broadly and optimally implemented in practice-based settings. Of particular concern is that such ML
algorithms may worsen health disparities in that they may lead to improvements in care for majority
populations without corresponding advancements for REL minority populations insofar as minority populations
are underrepresented in the development of these ML algorithms. Within this context, algorithms trained on
EHR data linked to geocoded data of social determinants of health (SDOH) and computerized adaptive testing
(CAT) has potential to improve suicide risk prediction. The portability (and thus scalability) of ML algorithms
across settings needs also to be demonstrated. Our current objective is therefore to develop EHR-derived ML
suicide risk algorithms that (i) minimize bias against underserved groups; (ii) are portable across settings; and
(iii) incorporate low-burden indices of general and population-relevant suicide risk. We will develop ML
algorithms with EHR data for prospective prediction of suicide risk for REL minority youth within 3 months of
inpatient discharge across 2 psychiatric inpatient services; determine the portability of these algorithms across
the 2 sites; and evaluate the added predictive value of SDOH and CAT data collected as part of standard care.
Our first aim is to develop prediction algorithms using EHR data to classify risk for STBs within 3 months of
discharge. We will evaluate the relative performance of co-trained versus locally trained ML algorithms from
two busy pediatric psychiatric inpatient sites to assess their portability. Our second aim is to evaluate the
incremental value of geocode-derived SDOH and CAT data in classifying suicide risk in REL minority youth. As
an exploratory aim, we will evaluate the performance of the algorithms developed in Aims 1 and 2 for specific
REL minority subsamples. The current project directly addresses NIMH/National Action Alliance for Suicide
Prevention’s Aspirational Goal to improve evaluation of suicide risk among diverse populations and in diverse
settings through feasible and scalable assessment strategies. It does so by focusing on REL minority youth,
disparity and underserved populations prioritized by NIH."

applied research on Cryptosporidium parvum, a zoonotic species responsible for about half of human cases
of cryptosporidiosis. The term Forward Genetics refers to methods used to identify genetic determinants of
specific phenotypes. This approach has expanded our understanding of model organisms, including the
taxonomically related species Toxoplasma gondii. The proposed project will impact primarily four areas of
Cryptosporidium research. 1) It will advance drug development efforts by identifying genetic loci targeted by
anti-Cryptosporidium compounds. 2) It will enable the dissection of the genetic basis of clinically relevant
traits such as drug susceptibility, virulence or oocyst output, and potentially uncover genes associated with
multidrug resistance. 3) It will contribute to the annotation of genes encoding proteins of unknown function,
which still represent a third of the Cryptosporidium genome. 4) The identification of drug resistance
mechanisms will facilitate the development of new selectable markers for advancing genome editing
procedures. To reduce the frequency of unselected mutations generated by random mutagenesis, and
maximize the probability of obtaining selectable C. parvum mutants, two alkylating mutagens and UV
irradiation will be used. Mutagenized parasite lines will be selected by backcrossing to wildtype C. parvum in
mice while applying drug selection. The genome of multiple drug-resistant C. parvum lines will be
sequenced and compared to the genome of the wildtype line to identify mutations under selection.
 Specific Aim 1 will investigate chemical mutagenesis to generate selectable C. parvum phenotypes.
We will select for resistance to two drugs: aurintricarboxylic acid, and the piperazine-based compound
MMV665917 from the Medicines for Malaria Venture collection, found to be effective against C. parvum. In
Specific Aim 2, UV irradiation will be used to mutagenize oocysts. For both aims, backcrossing to wildtype
C. parvum will be used to flush out irrelevant mutations. The genome of multiple, independently selected
drug-resistant lines will be sequenced. Mutations correlating with drug resistance in replicated selection
experiments will be identified by mapping sequence reads to the C. parvum reference genome. To
demonstrate causality, a mutation hypothesized based on replicated selection experiments to confer drug
resistance will be introduced into wildtype C. parvum using CRISP/Cas9. A successful outcome of this
research will highlight the value of forward genetics to innovate research on cryptosporidiosis."
10789889,"Project Summary/Abstract
The VA provides care for approximately 26% of individuals with SCI in the U.S. Treatment costs are 6.5
times higher than the cost of treatment of an average Veteran, and effective therapies to promote recovery of
neural function are lacking. Our overarching vision is to create an ex-vivo tissue that can replace the
damaged spinal cord and enable formation of new relay circuits across sites of even severe injury. Our
extensive rodent work with 3D printed biomimetic scaffolds shows that this approach can result in
electrophysiological and functional recovery after complete spinal cord transection, the most severe model
of spinal cord injury.
This project aims to assess the efficacy of 3D printed biomimetic scaffolds, loaded with human neural
progenitor cells and implanted sub-acutely, in a long-term clinically relevant, non-human primate model of
cervical spinal cord contusion.
There are 2 objectives to this project:
 1. Analysis of anatomical outcomes - Biocompatibility, integration, degradation, vascularization,
 host axon regeneration into the scaffold, and neural progenitor cell-derived axon outgrowth from the
 scaffold into the host.
 2. Analysis of functional outcomes. Animals will be functionally assessed on tasks of right-hand
 function, including Brinkman board, home cage-based robotic manipulation, forelimb and hindlimb
 use in an open field/exercise enclosure, and sensation.
Successful completion of the award will provide key data to support future clinical trials, with resulting high
impact."
10795663,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a growing problem due to increased longevity and obesity with estimates of 14 million
people living with this impairment. Knee OA results in decreased activity and lifestyle changes, further
exacerbating an individual’s health. Exoskeleton technology (Keeogo™, B-temia, Inc.) may be a viable alternative
to standard knee OA treatment by providing powered support to reduce pain during mobility. Preliminary
studies with the Keeogo™ in six persons with knee OA showed efficacy for pain reduction during different
mobility tasks. However, a tuning guide to promote better usability by clinicians and Veterans with knee OA,
knowledge about the biomechanics of how the device provides active assistance, and an in-laboratory evaluation
of performance outcomes compared with standard knee braces are lacking. Absence of published prescription,
tuning and general guidelines for use in Veterans with knee OA were also identified as limitations.
This proposal has four aims: Aim 1) to develop a knee OA-specific tuning guide for KeeogoTM that would
maximize user mobility activities with reduced pain across different levels of severity of knee OA; Aim 2) to
examine the biomechanical responses of Veterans with knee OA to the active assistance provided by the Keeogo™
as compared with the passive assistance provided by standard knee braces; Aim 3) to evaluate in-laboratory
mobility outcomes, pain perception, and user satisfaction with the KeeogoTM as compare with standard knee
braces; and Aim 4) to develop recommendations for prescribing and tuning the use of knee OA exoskeleton
devices. Aims 1 and 4 are development projects and no hypotheses are generated. The two hypotheses (H) to be
tested for Aim 2 are: H2.1) in stance phase, walking with KeeogoTM will show less knee adduction moment
(KAM), knee flexion moment (KFM), and muscle co-contraction than walking with standard knee braces. These
variables have been shown to be related to internal joint loading as well as disease progression and pain; H2.2)
in swing phase, walking with KeeogoTM will show greater knee range of motion (ROM), stride length, and foot
clearance than walking with standard knee braces. These variables have been shown to be related to antalgic gait
as a result of knee pain. The two hypotheses to be tested for Aim 3 are: H3.1) to show improved performance
outcomes on mobility tests, including a 6-minute walk test, timed up and go test, 13-step stair test, pick up penny
from floor test, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) when using the KeeogoTM as compared with
their prescribed knee braces and H3.2) to show reduced pain with the KeeogoTM by the numeric pain rating scale
(NPRS) as compared with their prescribed knee braces for the mobility tests.
The study will be conducted at two VA medical centers. The knee OA-specific tuning protocol will be developed
(Aim 1) and used in the in-laboratory evaluations (Aim 3) in 20 and 26 Veterans with knee OA, respectively, at
the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY. The biomechanical studies (Aim 2) will be conducted in 24
Veterans with knee OA at the VA Pittsburgh Health System-Human Engineering Research Laboratories,
Pittsburgh, PA. The investigators from both sites will work together to write the prescription and tuning
guidelines (Aim 4) for public use.
Expected outcomes: The tuning guide will facilitate quicker fitting and parameter adjustment, the biomechanics
studies are expected to identify underlying mechanisms of action during device use, the in-laboratory study is
expected to demonstrate improved walking velocities, stair ascent/descent times, improved sit-to-stand, stand-
to-sit, and object retrieval from the floor with reduced patient-reported pain; and the knee OA-specific
prescription and tuning guidelines will be deliverable for public use."

Virginia Shalkey Hahn, MD is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and heart failure cardiologist in the Division of
Cardiology at Johns Hopkins University. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator
harnessing bioinformatics to answer clinically relevant questions in the fields of heart failure and
cardiometabolic disease. She focuses on the intersection of cardiometabolic disease and heart failure due to
the rising prevalence of obesity and its prominent role in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
(HFpEF). HFpEF is a common disease with limited effective therapies due to its heterogeneity and limited
analysis of human tissue. Her prior work used myocardial transcriptomics to create HFpEF subgroups that had
distinct clinical profiles, one of which was composed of women with normal natriuretic peptides, a group that
was excluded from most all prior and even recent positive clinical trials for HFpEF. The Specific Aims of the
current proposal are to 1) determine differences in myocardial cell composition and cell cluster-specific
transcriptomics in HFpEF using single nuclei RNA sequencing, 2) define the myocardial metabolic profiles of
HFpEF using multi-omic analysis of endomyocardial biopsy tissue, and 3) measure differences in metabolite
uptake/secretion by the heart in HFpEF using coronary sinus sampling. The significance of the proposal stems
from the use of human tissue with strong clinical phenotyping, and its likelihood to spawn precision therapies
for HFpEF that target unique abnormalities in distinct subgroups, particularly subsets of female patients who
are traditionally excluded from clinical trials. Dr. Hahn has assembled a world-class mentoring team well-
poised to complete the research and training aims of the proposal. The primary mentor, Dr. David A. Kass, is
an internationally renowned cardiovascular scientist with >36 years of experience training several generations
of physician-scientists. He has extensive experience serving as primary mentor for NIH career development
awards. Co-mentors Dr. Patrick Ellinor and Dr. Kavita Sharma have expertise in cardiovascular bioinformatics,
translational research, and HFpEF. Collaborators add expertise in proteomics, metabolism, and bioinformatics.
The work is performed in the fertile academic environment at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,
where the Division of Cardiology demonstrates a clear commitment and investment in Dr. Hahn's research
career. The career development plan focuses on development of a formal bioinformatics skillset through
hands-on analysis and a Master of Science degree in Bioinformatics. These skills will distinguish Dr. Hahn
from her mentors as an independent investigator with a unique niche in bioinformatics and heart failure. Dr.
Hahn and her mentoring team are well poised to address the most pressing knowledge gaps in HFpEF and
make major breakthroughs toward better care for our patients."

10791801,"ABSTRACT
One of the epigenomic changes frequently observed during eukaryotic differentiation is the proteolysis of the
histone H3 N-terminal tail (H3NT) within chromatin. Although H3NT proteolysis was first described over 60
years ago and is a common feature of diverse eukaryotic developmental pathways, the functional significance
of this programmed epigenetic event remains largely undetermined. Progress in the field has been significantly
hindered by the lack of methods to identify the specific loci targeted for H3NT proteolysis. To overcome this
barrier we pioneered the first genome-wide method to discover and investigate H3NT-cleaved (H3cl) loci,
called ChIPac-Seq. The goal of this proposal is to optimize the technical and computational aspects of ChIPac-
Seq, which would support future efforts to adapt the ChIPac-Seq approach for high-throughput applications. To
this end we will leverage ChIPac-Seq to discover the cell type-specific loci selectively targeted for H3NT
proteolysis in differentiated osteoblasts, myocytes and adipocytes derived from the same multipotent
progenitor cell in vitro. The expected low concordance of H3cl loci between cell types provides the unique
opportunity to optimize the ChIPac-Seq computational analysis to identify bona fide H3cl loci with the highest
degree of rigor and to simplify and streamline the pipeline for use by the broad scientific community.
Furthermore, the direct functional effects of H3NT proteolysis in generating specific epigenetic changes at the
H3cl loci in terms of histone modifications, chromatin structure and transcription factor binding will be examined
by leveraging the wealth of publically available NGS datasets. The anticipated outcomes of this study will yield
transformative insights into the sites and mechanistic functions of H3NT proteolysis as a novel epigenetic
regulator and, importantly, produce an optimized ChIPac-Seq pipeline for use by the general scientific
community."

Our lab works on two main directions: ﬁrst, the determination of the structural and dynamic basis for
the function and assembly of large protein machineries; and second, the determination of the role of
internal protein dynamics in regulating protein activity and allosteric interactions. We propose to use
NMR spectroscopy, together with other biochemical and biophysical techniques, to determine at the
atomic resolution the mechanisms underpinning the function of two important protein families:
molecular chaperones and protein kinases.
Molecular chaperones are central to maintaining a functional proteome in the cell by rescuing non-
native proteins from aggregation and misfolding and assisting with their folding. Our lab reported the
ﬁrst ever high resolution structures of molecular chaperones in complex with unfolded proteins. We
will determine the structures of important chaperones such as the Hsp40, Hsp70 and Hsp90 in
complex with client proteins. We wish to address how different chaperones engage non-native
proteins and how distinct chaperone architectures may alter activity.
Src and BRAF hold a prominent place among the over 500 protein kinases encoded by the human
genome. Src is the archetypical kinase of the ~30 cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, half of which (Src,
Frk, Abl, Tec and Csk families) share the same core domain architecture consisting of an SH3, SH2
and kinase domain. As such, Src has served as the prototype for understanding how allosteric
interactions regulate the activity of kinases. BRAF is a member of RAF kinases and is a part of the
ERK signaling pathway, one of the most important and best studied signaling pathways in human
cancers. The BRAF gene is mutated in approximately 8% of human tumors with substitutions in the
A-loop, the P-loop and the DFG motif reported to give rise to a hyperactive kinase. We will use NMR
spectroscopy to characterize transiently populated conformational states, with the goal of uncovering
novel regulatory mechanisms in the human kinome."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) afflicts ~16% of the world population. Despite the availability of several classes
and types of antidepressant medications, patients typically take many weeks, if not months, to respond to these
drugs, and the majority never attain sustained remission of their symptoms. A remarkable development for the
pharmacological treatment of MDD is the finding that the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, is an effective, rapidly acting antidepressant in treatment-refractory patients.
During our previous funding cycle, we began exploring the role of ketamine’s metabolites in both the therapeutic
and adverse effects of ketamine. We identified behavioral, synaptic, and neurochemical effects of the (2R,6R)-
hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolite. In contrast to ketamine, (2R,6R)-HNK has low affinity for the NMDAR,
which is consistent with its reduced adverse effects as measured in preclinical studies. We have also found that
(2R,6R)-HNK enhances excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus through a concentration-
dependent, NMDAR activity-independent increase in glutamate release probability. Our long-term goal is to
elucidate the biological activities of (2R,6R)-HNK, as well as ketamine’s eleven additional HNK metabolites, and
utilize our findings to develop novel, effective compounds for the treatment of depression. The central hypothesis
is that HNKs exert an acute, synapse-selective form of presynaptic plasticity that leads to a sustained
strengthening of mood-relevant circuits. In Specific Aim #1 we will use slice electrophysiology to resolve the
synaptic actions of (2R,6R)-HNK, and identify the mechanism(s) by which (2R,6R)-HNK acutely enhances the
probability of synaptic glutamate release. We hypothesize that (2R,6R)-HNK acts through a presynaptic cAMP-
BDNF-dependent mechanism to promote glutamate release. In Specific Aim #2 we will use in vivo fiber
photometry assessments of neuronal activity to determine the synaptic effects of (2R,6R)-HNK on hippocampal
circuitry, specifically the Schaffer collateral synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. These experiments
will determine (2R,6R)-HNK’s synaptic action in an intact circuit. Finally, in Specific Aim #3 we will define, in vitro
and in vivo, the relative synaptic and behavioral potencies for all 12 HNKs produced via ketamine metabolism.
These experiments will define structure-activity relationships at the level of synaptic function, which will allow us
to refine the structure of the HNKs, in order to optimize their antidepressant and pharmacokinetic activity. Overall,
our work thus far strongly implicates an immediate drug effect on presynaptic plasticity, which when the
mechanism underlying this action is clarified, will open up new avenues for novel antidepressant drug discovery
based upon this mechanism. The completion of our proposed experiments will have implications for the
understanding of rapid-acting antidepressant drug pharmacology, development of novel and innovative
therapies, and the future treatment of depression."

10764954,"ABSTRACT
Exposure to manganese (Mn) through inhalation of welding fumes continues to be a health risk factor,
resulting in accumulation of brain Mn and neurochemical changes in welders, which further lead to changes
in mood, cognitive and motor function. Yet, not much is known about the dose-response relationships of
uptake and elimination of Mn in specific brain regions of the human brain. Furthermore, while animal and
cell studies strongly suggest oxidative stress as one of the primary mechanisms of Mn toxicity, markers of
oxidative stress and their relation to symptoms have not yet been explored in the human brain. Our novel
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) techniques allow generating whole-brain maps
of Mn deposition, as well as the measurement of glutathione (GSH), a marker of oxidative stress, and g-
aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. Using these techniques,
the primary objective of the proposed work is to elucidate the spatial-temporal uptake and elimination of
manganese in the human brain of welders, and the relationship of oxidative stress markers and
neurotransmitter imbalances in specific brain regions to mood, cognition and motor function. Our preliminary
data suggest that diffusion along white matter tracts may contribute to Mn deposition in cortical areas, and
that the time of elimination of brain Mn varies across the brain. Furthermore, exposure-induced increase of
thalamic GABA seems to be reversible upon reduction of Mn exposure. Making use of a longitudinal study
design, our unique access to a cohort of career welders for personal air sampling and accurate exposure
assessment, and our state-of-the-art neuroimaging technology, this proposal will test the central hypothesis
that the dose-response relationship of Mn deposition and elimination in the human brain varies across
different brain regions and leads, via oxidative stress and neurotransmitter imbalance, to brain region
specific symptoms. To test whether the uptake of brain Mn accumulation occurs sequentially across the
brain, leading to oxidative stress and GABA imbalance, Aim 1 will study dynamic Mn brain deposition by
following 20 new welding apprentices for two years into their welding career, using personal air sampling,
whole-brain quantitative MRI and the novel MRS editing technique, HERMES. In Aim 2 we will recruit 40
active experienced welders and 40 control workers to probe GSH and GABA in the thalamus, the
cerebellum and the frontal cortex. A test battery for changes in mood, cognition and motor function will be
used to study associations with neurochemical changes. In Aim 3 the same methods will be used to study
elimination of brain Mn by following 20 welders who cease to be exposed to Mn (retire, change job) for two
years. Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of human brain Mn deposition, neurochemical
responses and their relation to symptoms will have significant translational impact on our understanding of
the Mn dose-response relationship in welding and will inform safe levels of occupational Mn exposure."

hearing graduate Students, (THREADgS) is to rigorously train deaf and hard of hearing (D/HH) pre-doctoral
Scholars and support their advance into independent academic careers within biomedical research enterprise.
This is a vital unmet national need: the D/HH community is greatly underrepresented in the biomedical science
academic workforce. Even so, there is no T32 program at any United States research-intensive university that
focuses on training D/HH graduate students. The University of Rochester (UR) and the Rochester community
as a whole have the resources and infrastructure to support D/HH learners at all other career stages. As the UR
expands support for D/HH learners, THREADgS will also stimulate the further development of infrastructure to
support American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter training in scientific terminology through a centralized
mechanism. It will improve the environment for D/HH scientists, by “mentoring the mentors” to actively maintain
inclusive communication strategies for D/HH trainees. Also, by freely disseminating our approach and outcomes,
a successful implementation of this proposal will improve training for D/HH STEM graduate students everywhere.
Our goals are: 1.) Double the number of D/HH graduate Scholars at URSMD in five years, an NIH Category B
demographic – individuals with disabilities – that are critically underrepresented in biomedical research. 2.)
Complete our NIGMS-funded pipeline for D/HH training in biomedical research, which currently supports
undergraduates, masters’ students, and Ph.D. fellows, but not graduate Scholars. This is the only career pipeline
for D/HH individuals at any research-intensive institution. 3.) Dramatically improve Deaf-aware mentoring
through institutional support of formal training. 4.) Promote retention, social cohesion, and identification as
biomedical researchers among D/HH graduate Scholars to improve graduate rates and reduce training time. 5.)
Improve scientific training for all D/HH biomedical researchers by contributing to established lexicons of technical
signs in American Sign Language (ASL) and by freely disseminating both our approach and outcomes as peer-
reviewed articles. We will recruit 3 new D/HH scholars per year, with a maximum of a three-year appointment in
T32 funding, to maintain a steady state of 9 D/HH Scholars within the program. As trainees leave T32 funding
and complete their graduate studies, they will build a larger D/HH scholar community. Overall, this unique T32
program will equip our Scholars with the knowledge and research skills necessary for successful career
advancement. The ultimate goal is that our Scholars will achieve full-time academic appointments in higher
education and/or research institutions to reduce the dearth of D/HH faculty serving the nation's biomedical
research needs."

These studies address the large gap in knowledge regarding how commensal bacteria in the airway protect against bacterial pneumonia. Next generation sequencing studies of the airway microbiome have revealed that specific respiratory bacteria are associated with a reduced abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, indicating a potentially protective role. A long-term goal of this work is to reduce the burden of pneumonia by optimizing protection mediated by `beneficial' airway commensals. This project will advance this goal by addressing how a prominent respiratory bacterium influences immune-mediated clearance of S. pneumoniae from the lung. For this purpose, we developed an animal model that recapitulates the relationship between one of the most abundant bacteria detected in the lung, Prevotella melaninogenica, and lung infection with S. pneumoniae. Preliminary data indicate that exposure to P. melaninogenica dramatically improves early clearance of S. pneumoniae from the lung. This effect requires neutrophils, the innate immune receptor TLR2, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα. Neutrophils purified from the lungs of P. melaninogenica-exposed mice express TLR2-dependent TNFα and are more effective at killing S. pneumoniae. Further, digestion of P. melaninogenica lipoproteins, which are recognized by TLR2, is associated with loss of protection and TNFα expression, highlighting key roles for these molecules. Finally, regulation of P. melaninogenica-induced inflammation by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 restrains the TNFα-associated inflammatory response within 24 hours and is important for effective S. pneumoniae clearance. These data support the overall hypothesis that P. melaninogenica serves complementary roles to protect against S. pneumoniae infection by 1) inducing an innate immune response characterized by TLR2-dependent activation of neutrophils, which enhances rapid clearance of S. pneumoniae from the lung, while 2) supporting IL-10 dependent abrogation of infection-associated inflammatory damage. To address this hypothesis, Aim 1 investigates host factors required for enhanced S. pneumoniae killing, including alveolar macrophages, neutrophil TNFα signaling, and baseline immune priming by the endogenous microbiota. Aim 2 evaluates how lipoprotein-TLR2 signaling intersects with other Prevotella ligand-TLR interactions and addresses the generalizability of the protective effect by comparison with other Prevotella species. In Aim 3, lung cellular infiltration, activation and pathology will be assessed over the course of S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice with deficiencies in IL-10 or myeloid cell IL-10R to determine the kinetics and cellular targets of P. melaninogenica-induced, IL-10-mediated control of inflammation and injury. Together, these studies provide a mechanistic pathway to investigate the microbiome-lung axis in order to guide the development of new strategies to improve airway commensal-mediated protection in vulnerable populations."
10767892,"Neurogenic overactive bladder (NOAB), characterized by urinary frequency, urgency or urgency incontinence
symptoms occurring during the storage phase of the bladder, is the most common urinary complaint in multiple
sclerosis (MS). Current management options for NOAB in MS have limited efficacy and considerable adverse
effects, which underscores the significance of our study and highlights the need for better, less invasive
therapies. Our novel study investigates brain therapeutic targets that could shift the focus of NOAB management
in MS from a bladder-centric focus to brain restoration; specifically modulating the brain regions identified in our
prior functional magnetic resonance imagining studies. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
noninvasive brain stimulation that can modulate neurons (excite or inhibit) to improve the connectivity of the
regions of interest (ROI). Our preliminary data demonstrate, for the first time, significant improvement in bladder
symptoms in ten women with MS who have voiding dysfunction following multifocal transcranial magnetic
stimulation without any treatment-related adverse effects.
This randomized double-blind, sham-controlled single center clinical trial with an optional open-label extension
(OLE) phase is designed to evaluate the effects of targeted rTMS in women with MS and NOAB by investigating
restorative reorganization of brain function and improvement of urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence.
We hypothesize that cortical alterations in bladder volume sensing and their response to stimulation contribute
to NOAB symptoms in MS, and that improving the response to bladder distention (ROI within circuits 1 and 2)
with neuronavigated rTMS can restore brain activity and improve symptoms (frequency, urgency, and
incontinence). We will test our hypothesis with thses specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the clinical effects of
neuronavigated and multifocal active/sham rTMS in women with MS and NOAB; Aim 2: To assess the
neuroimaging restorative effects of neuronavigated active/sham rTMS in women with MS and NOAB; Aim 3: To
assess the long-term safety and therapeutic effects of repeated rTMS in women with MS and NOAB who
participate in the OLE phase (which subjects from both groups will be invited to enter at the 3-month follow up).
Efforts to improve our current knowledge of brain contribution to lower urinary tract function and the development
of an individualized, noninvasive, and effective treatment modality at the level of the brain will greatly impact the
quality of life for individuals with MS and subsequently others with OAB, whether neurogenic or non-neurogenic."

Non-inferiority trial of a therapeutic vaccine against Chagas disease in naturally-
infected rhesus macaques
Chagas disease is a major vector borne parasitic disease cause by the protozoan
parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with over 6 million cases in the Americas. Chronic chagasic
cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most common and life-threathening manifestation of
Chagas disease. There is a critical need to develop new treatments for Chagasic
patients, and vaccines would represent a very cost-effective alternative to drug therapy.
Preventive and therapeutic vaccines have shown promise in mouse and dog models, in
particular with vaccines based on TSA-1 and Tc24 parasite antigens. Therefore, our
long-term goal is to develop a human vaccine, to improve the prevention and control of
Chagas disease, and we have established a first public-private consortium to reach this
goal. The overall objective of the project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a
therapeutic vaccine against T. cruzi in non-human primates by performing a non-
inferiority trial in naturally infected rhesus macaques. Chagasic macaques will be
randomly assigned to treatments based on (a) our therapeutic vaccine alone, (b)
therapeutic vaccination plus subpatent benznidazole (BZN) treatment, for a non-
inferiority comparison with (c) the standard BZN drug treatment (comparator arm). We
will use blood parasitic load measured by qPCR, immediately (month 3) and 10 months
after treatment as a primary efficacy outcome, as in several current clinical trials. We will
test the hypothesis that therapeutic vaccination (alone or combined with BZN) is non-
inferior to conventional BZN treatment, immediately and 10 months after treatment. We
will also monitor cardiac function through electrocardiographic and echographic
recordings as a secondary outcome, to test the hypothesis that cardiac function can be
preserved by therapeutic vaccination. Finally, we will identify the immune correlates and
biomarkers for disease progression and response to treatments by associating
candidate molecules with cardiac function and parasite burden. Upon completion of
these studies, we expect to identify a leading vaccine candidate for future clinical trials,
which will lead to improved patient care and control of Chagas disease."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Mechanisms that spatiotemporally
coordinate intracellular signaling in cardiomyocytes remain ill-defined. While the roles of phosphorylation in cardiac
signal transduction have been studied for decades, very little is known regarding regulation of signaling by lipid
modifications. Cysteine palmitoylation or S-acylation is the reversible attachment of fatty acids onto proteins
catalyzed by zDHHC S-acyl transferases. S-acylation is an optimal mechanism to regulate dynamic association of
proteins with signaling complexes and receptors at specified membrane domains. Cytokine receptors signal through
the Janus kinase (Jak)-Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) pathway to integrate inflammatory
and profibrotic signals and mediate inflammatory gene expression programs during cardiac stress, such as the
response to pressure overload. In response to pathological stimulation, ischemic injury, or infection, macrophages
and other immune cells infiltrate the heart and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate the Jak-Stat
pathway in cardiac myocytes, which when prolonged contributes substantially to adverse cardiac remodeling that
hastens disease pathogenesis. Strikingly, unbiased proteomics identified Jak1 as the protein with the most
increased S-acylation in hearts of mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of the Golgi enzyme,
zDHHC9. Transgenic mice overexpressing zDHHC9 go on to develop cardiac hypertrophy that progresses to
functional decompensation and failure, but this phenotype is preceded by enhanced Jak1 S-acylation and
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3, suggesting zDHHC9 activates prohypertrophic Jak1/Stat3
signaling in cardiac myocytes in vivo. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that zDHHC9-regulated S-
acylation of Jak1 promotes its anterograde trafficking to cytokine receptors, Stat3 activation in response to cytokine
stimulation, and consequently maladaptive cardiac remodeling, myocardial inflammation, and heart failure
progression. In this application we will manipulate zDHHC9 and Jak1 S-acylation in the context of pressure
overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy to achieve the following aims: (1) determine functions of zDHHC9 in the
regulation of cardiomyocyte Jak-Stat signaling, hypertrophy and adverse remodeling, and (2) delineate mechanistic
roles of Jak1 S-acylation in cytokine receptor signaling during the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.
We will ascertain functions of zDHHC9 and Jak1 S-acylation on Jak1 protein trafficking and stability, Stat3
activation and transcriptional programs, and correlate the kinetics of these signaling outputs with pathophysiologic
cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis that promote adverse remodeling and
the transition to heart failure. These studies will establish a paradigm for regulated S-acylation as a mechanism
governing the duration and amplitude of cardiomyocyte cytokine receptor signaling and identify maladaptive
intracellular signaling mechanisms that may provide novel targets for the treatment of heart disease."

 Neurodegeneration is an increasing public health challenge and remains an unsolved
biomedical problem. Protein misfolding and aggregation are a central feature of
neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). The complexity of neurodegeneration calls for large-scale unbiased screening
studies. Over the past few years, we have made breakthrough observations with significant
implications for understanding the cellular defense systems against proteotoxicity underlying
pathogenesis in ALS/FTD. Using a unique blend of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological
approaches, we have uncovered novel pathways that enable reprogramming of protein quality
control to counter proteotoxicity. The newly proposed work in this project is aimed at elucidating
mechanisms underlying newly identified regulators and master switches in protein quality
control. The studies on the previously unrecognized higher-order regulators could expand our
understanding of proteotoxic-stress-responsive quality control systems in the cell, beyond the
well-established heat shock response or unfolded protein response. Our unique abilities to
contribute to this field are at both conceptual and technical levels: In additional to novel
pathways, we have developed unique C. elegans/mammalian reporter systems to study
proteotoxicity-associated neurodegeneration, and our recent success bodes well for future
plans. Furthermore, our expanding repertoire of tools will allow us to extend the findings to
diverse models and patient cells. The specific aims are to elucidate the mechanisms through
which a novel conserved pathway, involving a previously unknown transcriptional master switch,
in the regulation of protein quality control, to delineate the pathways through which a novel
target and its signaling pathway regulate proteotoxicity, and to develop new tools for more
advanced search for key regulators of proteotoxicity and quality control. The findings will not
only provide novel entry points for understanding the toxicities of key ALS/FTD proteins, such as
SOD1, TDP-43, and C9orf72 DPRs, but also reveal molecular targets for harnessing the cellular
defense system to prevent and treat the relevant neurodegenerative diseases. We predict that
the advances gained through our research efforts will eventually lead to new therapeutic
interventions to address these diseases in the world’s rapidly aging population."
10753574,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cells and organisms, from simple to complex, carry the same genetic DNA sequence organized into genes.
Multicellular eukaryotes transcribe and process genes into RNA isoforms through a process called alternative
splicing. Alternative splicing is developmentally and cell-type specifically regulated. It is foundational to how
higher organisms’ genomes are decoded. Yet, critical and fundamental questions regarding its regulation and
the function of its output remain unanswered. For example, circRNA being a ubiquitous product of alternative
splicing was only discovered in 2012, and its regulation and function remains enigmatic. circRNAs’ discovery
revealed a larger critical knowledge gap in the field for “what, how and why” genes are alternatively spliced.
What RNA splice variants are expressed, how splicing is regulated and which spliced RNAs have essential
functions? Answering these questions is critical for predicting which of myriad genetic variants cause disease
and why they do so. Answers will also enable a new generation of digital nucleic acid biomarkers and
diagnostics for disease, drug targets for correcting dysregulated splicing and identification of pathogenic
protein- or non-coding products (respectively) as well as fundamental basic scientific insight into evolution and
function of eukaryotic genomes. The proposed research will couple novel statistical analyses of -omics data by
taking an unbiased approach and including biological features that are understudied or un-annotated.
Predictions will be coupled with incisive experimental validation to reveal new principles of how RNAs,
including circRNAs, are spliced and how they function. This research potentiates significant new discoveries in
why alternative splicing exists and how this understanding can be used for precision medicine."
10771109,"Project Summary/Abstract
 For most patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment.
Underserved racial/ethnic minority and low-income individuals have a greater burden of ESRD (higher
incidence and more rapid progression), yet they have much poorer access to transplant. Before patients are
considered for waitlisting at a transplant center, dialysis facility teams perform complex medical and
psychosocial assessments of patients' suitability for transplant and decide whether to refer them to a transplant
center for full evaluation. These pre-referral assessment processes, which vary widely across clinical teams,
have been identified as among the most important potential drivers of downstream disparities in transplant
waitlisting and receipt. The objective of this application for a NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development
Award (K01) is to support an assistant professor at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health to
become an independent health services researcher fully equipped with the skills to build understanding of
these patient assessment processes and to improve their treatment outcomes. To that end, this K01 award will
provide training in clinical nephrology, qualitative and survey research methods, implementation science
frameworks, and grant-writing. The research aims are designed to reinforce and apply these new skills and
concepts in an investigation of dialysis facilities' pre-referral patient assessment processes. Specifically, the
K01's research objective is to use rigorous qualitative and survey research methods to elucidate the
measurable and modifiable provider-level constructs of cognitive load (stress, time pressure, disruptions) and
uncertainty tolerance (anxiety or worry in response to uncertainty) and their impact on disparities in pre-referral
assessments within their dialysis facility context. Aim 1 will use qualitative methods to explore how provider-
level factors (e.g., cognitive load, uncertainty tolerance) and multi-level contextual factors (e.g., facility-level
standard protocols, local transplant center policies) shape dialysis facility teams' processes for pre-referral
patient assessment. Aim 2 will develop and validate a survey to quantify staff, dialysis facility, and community
characteristics in the context of pre-referral assessments using a survey pilot and a rigorous modified Delphi
approach. Aim 3 will conduct a survey of n≈2000 dialysis facility staff across 13 states and use linked data on
patient transplant evaluation outcomes (referral, evaluation start, and waitlisting) to assess how staff cognitive
load and uncertainty tolerance are related to racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in transplant access
as well as dialysis facility and community characteristics. The protected time, resources, and mentoring
available through this career development award will enable Dr. Adam Wilk to emerge as an independent and
leading researcher, conducting groundbreaking survey research and fostering the development and
implementation of multi-level interventions to address barriers in access to transplant or other preferred
treatments for underserved patients with kidney disease and other complex chronic conditions."
10771162,"Disorders associated with altered lipid metabolism such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atherosclerosis are a significant health threat to the U.S. population. As result, it is imperative to define the molecular mechanisms driving abnormal lipid homeostasis to identify new and effective therapeutics. Insulin- resistance is one of the most significant risk factors for lipid dysfunction; however, significant knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of how abnormal insulin action leads to altered lipid metabolism in metabolic disease. The liver is responsible for regulating the rates of lipid production and breakdown to control systemic lipid homeostasis. Dysregulation of these processes underly the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia and NAFLD, the latter consisting of a spectrum of liver diseases that encompasses simple liver steatosis (NAFL) and non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Work by several laboratories including ours have implicated liver insulin signaling via the AKT-mTORC1 pathway in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Recent work from our laboratory uncovered a novel function for liver mTORC1 signaling in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism that is essential for the proper control of both hepatic and systemic lipid levels by insulin. This discovery has important implications to NAFLD and dyslipidemia and adds significant mechanistic insight into the role of insulin signaling via mTORC1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will build on these important observations and define the molecular mechanism underlying mTORC1's control of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and hepatic lipid homeostasis. In Aim 2, we will explore the therapeutic potential of manipulating liver mTORC1 signaling in the initiation and progression of NAFLD using multiple models of NASH. Collectively, this proposal will build upon recent discoveries regarding the role of insulin signaling via mTORC1 in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. These experiments have the potential to significantly affect our mechanistic understand of the metabolic pathways that connect abnormal insulin signaling to NAFLD and dyslipidemia, which will provide the foundation for new therapeutic targets for fatty liver disease and pro- atherogenic dyslipidemia."
10808087,"Project Summary: Ovarian cancer (OC) is associated with the highest mortality rate of all gynecologic
malignancies in the United States. The low rate of survival is mainly due to two factors: 1) the advanced stage
of the disease at diagnosis, and 2) the inadequate efficacy of available therapeutic options, especially for
recurrent metastatic disease. The standard-of-care for patients with primary OC includes debulking surgery
(removal of ovaries and visible intraperitoneal tumors) followed by chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs
(e.g., cisplatin) and paclitaxel (PTX). However, approximately 90% of patients after suboptimal resection and
70% of patients after optimal cytoreduction will experience relapse within 18-24 months. Unfortunately, there is
no effective standard-of-care for recurrent patients who return to the clinic with drug-resistant metastatic
disease. As a result, their survival rate is very low. The objective of this research is “to develop a non-surgical,
targeted, and clinically translatable stem cell-based platform that can overcome drug resistance in recurrent
and metastatic ovarian cancer”. The success of the developed stem cell-based platform will be measured by
not only demonstrating the eradication of metastasis and inhibition of relapse, but also providing long-term
survival benefits. To achieve this objective, we genetically engineered and isolated a unique adipose-derived
stem cell (ASC) clone that overexpresses secretory human carboxylesterase 2 for targeted enzyme/prodrug
therapy of cancer, and nanoluciferase for quantification of response to therapy and evaluation of cancer
relapse. Using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) complemented with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated that the engineered ASCs migrate and localize at both ovarian tumor
stroma and necrotic regions. Our published data also show that the engineered ASCs are able to target and kill
the drug-resistant OC cells that are rich in cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), overexpress MDR-1/ABCG2 drug
efflux pumps, and have high ALDH enzyme activity. Statistical analyses of tumor burden and survival rates
showed that administration of the engineered ASCs in combination with the prodrug irinotecan provided
complete tumor response and survival benefits in 80% of treated mice. To transform this ASC-based
technology into a platform with a broad application in targeted therapy of recurrent OC, we will use epithelial
OC cells that are obtained from patients who have received various treatment modalities but have returned to
the clinic with drug-resistant disease. The biodistribution and tumor tropism of the engineered ASCs will be
determined by BLI, MRI, and immunohistochemistry. The tumor response to therapy, inhibition of cancer
relapse, and long-term survival benefits will be determined in immunocompromised mice. Tumor tissues from
non-responsive groups will be collected and characterized at molecular, cellular and genomic levels to
understand the mechanisms underlying their escape and to help develop corrective measures. Adverse effects
during treatment and toxicity to healthy tissues will be studied by histopathology & hematology."
10755657,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sex-hormone fluctuations across the ovarian cycle exert powerful effects on female brain and behavior, and are
likely contributors to female-specific risks for neuropsychiatric conditions. This is exemplified by anxiety and
depression, disorders twice as prevalent in women of reproductive age compared to their male counterparts.
However, the mechanisms underlying the dynamic nature of the female brain remain poorly understood, limiting
our ability to design sex-specific treatments for female-biased disorders. The goal of our research is to address
this critical need, and to reveal the molecular mechanisms through which sex hormones dynamically impact
female brain structure and behavior. To this end, we recently made the important discovery that chromatin
organization, a major epigenetic mechanism controlling gene expression, is highly dynamic in the female ventral
hippocampus (vHIP) of mouse, as a function of the estrous cycle stage. We linked these chromatin dynamics to
changes in neuronal gene expression and to variation in vHIP-dependent, anxiety-related behaviors in mice.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that rhythmic sex-hormone changes induce extensive chromatin re-
organization in vHIP neurons across the ovarian cycle, resulting in cyclic changes in gene activity and
contributing to increased female vulnerability to anxiety-related phenotypes associated with the varying estrogen
state. To address this hypothesis, we designed the current study with three independent aims to reveal estrous
cycle- and sex-specific epigenetic gene regulation in vHIP neurons in mice, and to provide a mechanistic link
between vHIP chromatin dynamics and anxiety-related behavior. In Aim 1, we will use cutting-edge epigenomics
methods to identify estrous cycle- and sex-specific cis-regulatory elements and chromatin mechanisms driving
transcriptional programs in vHIP neurons. In Aim 2, we will use a single-cell transcriptomic analysis and RNA in
situ hybridization to reveal vHIP neuronal clusters that are transcriptionally responsive to cycling hormones and
possible drivers of cyclic changes in chromatin and behavior. In Aim 3, we will genetically manipulate a candidate
epigenetic regulator identified by bioinformatics approaches, to identify a functional role of these sex-specific
chromatin dynamics in gene regulation and anxiety-related behavior. Overall, these studies will reveal chromatin-
dependent molecular mechanisms controlling neuronal gene expression and anxiety-related behavior across the
estrous cycle. These findings will provide a necessary first step to identify candidate, sex-specific targets for the
treatment of female-biased disorders such as anxiety and depression."
10770404,"CRISPR-based gene editing has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic brain disorders. However,
complications with brain delivery have limited the utility of CRISPR-based therapeutics. To address this critical
need, we have developed a new gene editing delivery vehicle, termed CRISPR-PEG, which is composed of Cas9
RNP conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). CRISPR-PEG has tremendous promise as a delivery vehicle
because of its excellent biocompatibility, the well-established clinical track record of PEG, and its enhanced tissue
diffusion capability in comparison to nanoparticles. Our preliminary results demonstrate that CRISPR-PEG delivers
and edits neurons efficiently in the motor cortex or striatum in mice; after an intracranial injection, neurons were
edited with a high specificity (45~85%). Notably, CRISPR-PEG also edited neurons in the olfactory bulb after
intranasal administration. These exciting results demonstrate that CRISPR-PEG has great potential as bio-tool, and
as a platform for developing therapeutics. In this proposal we will test our novel delivery vehicle CRISPR-PEG in
fragile X syndrome (FXS). We have selected FXS as a test bed for CRISPR-PEG because it is the most common
inherited cause of intellectual disability with no treatment available. In addition, FXS has a monogenic cause,
namely expanded CGG repeats>200 and hypermethylation in the FMR1 promoter region, which causes silencing of
the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Therefore, the central objectives of this proposal are (1) to test
CRISPR-PEG in brain disorders by targeting FXS-associated genes, and (2) to develop new CRISPR-PEG variants
with improved diffusion and efficiency. The central hypothesis is: the novel non-viral delivery vehicle CRISPR-
PEG will deliver Cas9 RNPs into the brain, efficiently edit FXS-associated genes in neurons, and rescue mice from
multiple FXS-associated phenotypes. The central objective will be accomplished by completing the following
specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. Knock down mGluR5 using CRISPR-PEG in the mouse model of FXS as proof of principle.
Specific Aim 2. Reactivate FMR1 gene expression using CRISPR-PEG.
Specific Aim 3. Develop CRISPR-PEGs that diffuse throughout the brain and edit brain tissue efficiently.
 At the completion of this proposed study, we will have developed an efficient strategy for gene editing neurons
using a novel non-viral delivery vehicle CRISPR-PEG. Our proposed studies are significant because the results
will provide the basis for developing therapeutics for FXS and fragile X-associated disorders caused by FMR1
deficiency. Moreover, we will develop a non-viral-based vehicle that can edit large volumes of brain tissue after a
single injection. The experiments in this proposal are highly innovative because we will have developed an efficient
and safe non-viral delivery vehicle, which will greatly advance the field of neuroscience and CRISPR-based
therapeutics."

Project 1: Epidemiology of MDRO Carriage and Adverse Health Outcomes in Nursing Homes
 Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are serious and urgent threats to human health. Although
extensive efforts have begun to reverse the tide in hospitals, investments are severely lacking in nursing
homes (NHs) where MDRO prevalence is much greater (routinely 65% vs. 10% in hospitals). NHs are unique
settings that may be particularly prone to spreading contagion due to their long lengths-of-stay, care of
medically vulnerable residents, encouragement of shared spaces and activities, high staff turnover, and limited
infection prevention training. Due to scarce resources for screening, surveillance, and strategies to combat
MDROs, evidence is needed to create guidelines for MDRO reduction strategies specific to NHs.
 This project will encompass an in-depth and simultaneous assessment of five major MDROs of clinical
significance to the 1.4 million people who are cared for in 15,000 U.S. nursing homes each year. These
MDROs include three endemic pathogens that are entrenched in NHs, namely methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and extended-spectrum beta-
lactamase producers (ESBLs), as well as two emerging MDROs– carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
(CRE), and Candida auris, an antibiotic-resistant fungus capable of substantial morbidity and mortality. The
goal of the simultaneous assessment of these MDROs is to assess synergistic capture from screening cultures
and inform interventions that would target MDROs in concert.
 We will capitalize on the combination of retrospective and prospective studies involving over 10,000 NH
residents from 50 NHs to evaluate efficient ways to sample body sites and environmental objects for MDRO
carriage and co-carriage. We also will perform comprehensive assessments of resident, NH, and community-
level risk factors for carriage of MDROs, alone and in combination. Beyond carriage, we will use these data to
assess risk factors for later MDRO infection and hospitalization. Importantly, we will specifically evaluate
whether risk factors are differentially affected by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status to better elucidate
NH disparities in care delivery or health outcomes. Knowledge of major drivers of carriage and infection will
inform the need and value of NH interventions to transform policy and practice."

The overall theme of the “3-D Aging & Alzheimer Brain Program” is to is to define the effect of multiple pathologies
on the aged brain in three dimensions by combining single cell-based approaches with spatially-resolved
transcriptomic and proteomic measurements. To accomplish this goal, the Program has been organized into four
cores and four research projects, each with their own individual goals whose complexity and ultimate
interconnection requires careful coordination and oversight. Central to this effort is the Administrative Core
(Admin Core), which will serve as the organizational hub for our Program, providing an umbrella of scientific
oversight, coordination, and support for the Program activities. The Admin Core will be led by the Program
Director, Dr. Philip De Jager, who will be responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations with support from
a project coordinator and an administrative assistant. Together, they will provide support for administrative and
financial activities, as well as manage all internal and external communications, including those with the National
Institute on Aging (NIA). To ensure scientific oversight of the Program, the Director will chair the Steering
Committee, which will be composed of Core and Project Co-Leads, as well as relevant NIH staff. The experience
of the Steering Committee members will be leveraged to establish a Charter and to set attainable deliverables
at the onset of the Program. Additionally, the Steering Committee will meet monthly to coordinate and ensure
that the overall goals of the Program are being achieved. The Steering Committee will work closely with the NIA
to assemble an External Advisory Board (EAB), which will annually evaluate the Program and provide external
oversight. The Admin Core will develop and implement a state-of-the art Laboratory Information Management
System (LIMS) to ensure appropriate tracking of specimens and data between the Program components. The
Admin Core will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with the Program’s resource sharing plan in order
to maximize access to the resources generated by the Program. This will be facilitated via a collaboration with
Sage Bionetworks in order to oversee distribution of all Program data and resources via the NIA-sponsored
repository, AD Knowledge Portal. The Admin Core will organize a quarterly educational meeting focused on the
techniques and best practices implemented via this Program. To help promote awareness of Program resources
and scientific activities, the Program will participate in and host an annual research symposium and establish an
outward-facing website. The Admin Core is designed to provide research and logistical oversight and facilitate
communication among all Program components to enhance efficiency, reduce cost, and maintain the timely
achievement of milestones. The proper dissemination of Program-generated resources to the scientific
community will fill the large gap in knowledge regarding the 3-dimensional modeling of molecular events in the

10935934,"BIOSPECIMEN CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of our “3-D Aging & Alzheimer Brain Program” is to define, using single cell-based
approaches with spatially-resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements, the effect of aging and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related pathologies on the brain in three dimensions and the relation of these effects
on cognitive decline. Crucial to achieving this goal is consistent access to well-phenotyped, high quality, human
brain tissue that has been consented for broad data sharing. The Biospecimen (BIO) Core will be responsible
for compiling one of the largest collections of tissue across the lifespan and known pathological hallmarks of AD
by continuing prospective collection of comparably phenotyped high quality cases at the University of Edinburgh,
the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, and the New York Brain Bank (NYBB). The goal of the BIO Core is to link
clinical-pathologic data with contemporary molecular techniques from brain tissue to facilitate innovative
research studies on aging and AD. The BIO core will (1) support each of the four Projects by identifying,
preparing, and distributing the best available samples for each aim, (2) determine the plane of section for each
sample, and (3) assemble standardized outcome measures from each sample. The BIO Core will also support
the innovative methodological development of the Spatial Multiomics (SM) Core through the acquisition and
provision of high-quality molecular grade tissues. In parallel, the harmonized phenotypic data will flow to the
Integrated Computational Analysis (ICA) Core which will align the phenotypes with data for each of the Projects.
A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), managed by the Administrative Core, will be used to
organize and track all sample characteristics, enabling a structured evaluation of the sample selection and
preparation process to uncover any areas of weakness and identify new quality measures. In summary, the BIO
Core will significantly enhance the quality, annotation, and re-purposability of the data produced by this Program
and its processes and protocols will help guide and enhance improvements in tissue processing for the wider

PROJECT SUMMARY
Core C supports all projects within the Program by providing access to sophisticated organoid-based animal
models, small-animal imaging technologies, histopathology, and imaging of organoid and tumor samples. These
services enable Program investigators to obtain insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms driving tumor
progression, therapy response, and metastasis. Core C will assist with the design of animal experiments and
support live animal imaging from classical bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to state-of-the-art imaging
technologies, available only in a limited number of locations worldwide, such as small-animal positron emission
tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The Core will also support
imaging with customized reporters for different cell signaling pathways. Histopathological services will be
provided through a consultant agreement with a world-class pathologist specializing in mouse models of cancer.
Finally, the Core will support immunolabeling of fixed organoids and tumor tissues, including support for whole-
mount 3-dimensional (3D) volume scanning with antibody labeling and for multiplex immunohistochemistry.
During the upcoming period of requested support, Core C proposes to support Program investigators through
three aims. First, the program will provide assistance with animal modeling using transplantation with cancer cell
lines and organoid-derived cancer cells. Organoid-based animal modeling requires optimization for each line to
achieve optimal dissociation of cells before injection. Second, the core will provide Program investigators with
tools to track tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy responses by assisting with small-animal BLI, ultrasound,
PET, SPECT, and computed tomography (CT) imaging. Conducting imaging experiments with PET, SPECT,
and CT requires not only sophisticated imaging equipment and reporters but also considerable expertise. Third,
the core will assist with the analysis of tissues from animals, from histopathological evaluations to standard
immune labeling, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and state-of-the-art 3D volume reconstruction with antibody
labeling. Finally, Core C will assist with the use of advanced imaging software, including Image J (NIH) and
Imaris (Bitplane). New in this renewal is support for CT, PET, and SPECT imaging in live animals and multiplex
immunohistochemistry and 3D volume reconstruction on fixed organoid and tissue samples.
Together, Core C provides a comprehensive platform for animal modeling and imaging, covering all necessary
approaches for characterizing tumor growth in vivo. A Core that enables program investigators access to these
technologies is essential as most of the services supported by the Core require specialized expertise and
training. Thus, Core C will provide critical tools for Program members and, through the development of new
imaging approaches, ultimately the broader cancer research community."

This application is a competitive renewal of Translational Oncology Research Training for Surgeon Scientists,
a transformative training program at the University of Kentucky (UK) designed for qualified trainees in the
surgical disciplines and with an interest in oncology research. The program addresses critical national
declines in the number of surgeon scientists engaged in cancer research through a two-year period of
intensive, interdisciplinary mentored research training to prepare trainees to become independent scientists
who are well prepared to incorporate state-of-the-art techniques learned during their training period into a
successful academic research career. Trainees (2 each year) typically enter the program following
completion of postgraduate year (PGY) 2 or 3 of their residency training or upon completion of the surgical
residency and select either the basic science option (Track 1) or the healthcare delivery research option
(Track 2). Opportunities in Track 1 span cell signaling, tumor biology, cancer progression and metastasis as
well as evolving areas such metabolomics, oncogenomics and epigenetics. Track 2, a proposed new program
component, provides training in cancer disparities, implementation science and population-level enquiry. In
addition to an intensive research experience, trainees complete a Master of Science or PhD degree in clinical
and translational sciences and supplement their coursework with further development through a combination
of formal courses and professional skills development workshops and seminars in such areas as responsible
conduct of research, reproducibility and manuscript and proposal development. Through regularly scheduled
seminars and lectures available through the Markey Cancer Center, their departments and prominent UK
centers, including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, trainees engage in rich experiential and
didactic learning that prepares them as active contributors to the types of multidisciplinary teams that are
essential for the optimal treatment of the complex cancer patient. The requirement to successfully complete
either a master’s or PhD degree adds depth and breadth to this program of training, broadening exposure to
other UK scientists serving on thesis committees. The primary training faculty is composed of basic and
population scientists and clinician-scientists, all of whom work collaboratively across disciplines; each primary
faculty mentor is a recognized expert in his or her field and has a long record of research productivity in the
training of young investigators. A “pipeline” mentor development mechanism allows us to develop promising
early-career faculty members as mentors within our team-based mentoring approach. This program, which is
committed to fostering diversity in the community of surgeon scientists, including women and those from
underrepresented groups, has been highly successful in achieving its goals to address alarming declines in
the number of active surgeon-scientists conducting oncology research. As a training faculty, we are
passionate, motivated and committed to the training of future academic surgeons."
10786031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand genetic buffering, or how some individuals overcome
the effects of a harmful genetic mutation. We generated a zebrafish model of buffering in order to understand
how individuals who should have gotten sick are somehow able to live unaffected healthy lives. In our model,
we used selective breeding to generate two strains of zebrafish that develop dramatically different head
skeletons in response to the same harmful genetic mutation. In one strain, the mutation causes severe, lethal
skeletal defects. Meanwhile, the other strain is remarkably buffered against the mutation. The buffered fish
develop essentially normal head skeletons, surviving to be fertile, viable adults. We compare these strains to
understand the natural buffering mechanisms that are present in some fish, and likely in some humans too. We
hypothesize that buffering is due to factors that tune developmental processes to restore balance. For
example, in Aim1 we will determine how DNA sequences which oppose the mutant gene can be turned down.
In Aim 2 we examine how factors encoded in the DNA which perform the same function as the mutant gene
can be turned up. In Aim 3 we will determine how changes that do not necessarily involve alterations in the
DNA sequence can buffer the harmful mutation. These three specific aims test how interacting mechanisms
function together to buffer development. We designed experiments to address these aims using state of the art
methods like genome editing and sequencing, colorful cell and tissue labeling, quantitative measurements of
large numbers of fish skeletons, and rigorous statistical analyses. The mechanisms we propose to study here
are present in many developmental systems and organisms and therefore will likely be applicable in wide-
ranging settings. This study of buffering mechanisms could lead to novel therapeutic approaches, buffering
mechanisms might be manipulated in the future to manage disease symptoms. This work will also lead to a
better understanding of the factors that make predicting genetic disease from gene sequences difficult. Thus,
this line of research will potentially inform and improve medical practices, including genetic disease
management, disease diagnosis, and counseling, falling squarely within the mission of the NIDCR to improve
dental, oral and craniofacial health through research."
10767827,"Project Summary
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a deadly condition characterized by the rapid onset of
hypoxemia and respiratory failure. The mainstay of therapy for ARDS patients is supportive care with
mechanical ventilation (MV). Although life-saving, mechanical ventilation can exacerbate lung injury and even
cause de novo injury, known as ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). VILI arises from mechanical forces during
MV including excessive stretch (volutrauma), excessive pressure (barotrauma), and injury due to repeated
collapse and reopening of lung units (atelectrauma). The molecular mechanisms by which these mechanical
forces exacerbate lung injury remain poorly understood. Clinicians try to prevent VILI by monitoring airway
pressures and using low tidal volumes, but injury persists even when these parameters are in a “safe” range.
Currently, there are no pharmacologic therapies to prevent or treat VILI in patients with ARDS. mTORC1 is a
central regulator of cell growth and lipid metabolism. In contrast to canonical activation of mTORC1 under
favorable growth conditions, we recently discovered that mTORC1 is activated in lung epithelial cells following
injurious mechanical ventilation. We also found that pharmacologic mTORC1 inhibition prevents lung injury
during mechanical ventilation. We hypothesize that mTORC1 activation plays a central role in mediating VILI
and represents a novel therapeutic target in ARDS. We will determine the mechanisms by which mTORC1
inhibition prevents VILI using mice with mTORC1 inactivation in type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells as
well as novel in vitro models of mechanical ventilation in the human lung. In Aim 1 we will identify how
mTORC1 activation induces surfactant dysfunction during ventilator induced lung injury. In Aim 2 we will
identify the mechanisms by which mTORC1 regulates epithelial membrane repair following injurious
mechanical ventilation. In Aim 3 we will use clinically relevant 2-hit models that utilize mechanical ventilation
following lung injury from sepsis or influenza pneumonia to test the efficacy of mTORC1 inhibition to prevent
VILI in ARDS. Our studies will provide an in-depth understanding of how mTORC1 activation impairs surfactant
function and membrane repair during VILI and will identify novel drug targets for patients with ARDS."
10806133,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most chemorefractory cancers among solid tumors.
Even with the most effective chemotherapy (i.e., FOLFIRINOX), only 30% of PDAC patients respond. Therefore,
identifying novel therapies is an urgent and unmet need in the PDAC field. One of the emerging strategies for
treating these patients is targeting tumor architecture. The rationale of these therapies is to target tissue-specific
properties, either in the stroma or in the tumor compartment, to disrupt tumor tissue homeostasis during disease
progression or in response to treatment (chemotherapies). The majority of the previous studies have focused on
targeting the stroma compartment (cellular or extracellular matrix portion), leaving the tumor compartment (e.g.,
tumor tissue-specific properties) a relatively unexplored territory.
The goal of this proposal is to fill this knowledge gap by identifying tissue-specific properties in the tumor
compartment to impair disease progression and to overcome PDAC chemoresistance. The rationale and
feasibility of our proposed research studies are supported by our recent published work (Ligorio et al., Cell,
2019), in which we showed the existence of 8 different types of tumor glands, based on their internal composition
of cells, with distinct proliferation (PRO) and metastatic (EMT) capabilities. Moreover, we found that tumor glands
can be considered discrete functional “units” with distinct levels of aggressiveness and different chemorefractory
behaviors. Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is that tissue-specific properties exist that govern
tumor architecture by regulating the formation, internal structure, and evolution of tumor glands during
disease progression and under treatment.
To test this central hypothesis, we have recently developed (i) a method that allows us to characterize the cell
identity (i.e., different PRO and EMT phenotypes) while preserving architectural information within human tissue,
and (ii) an ad hoc mouse model to study tumor gland-forming ability using a time-course in vivo imaging
technique (i.e., two-photon microscopy). By integrating these two methodologies, we (a) will clarify the functional
behavior of tumor glands as a consequence of their internal structure (AIM.1), (b) will target an aggressive
subpopulation of cancer cells to impair tissue homeostasis (AIM.2), and (c) will define the role of tumor
architecture in PDAC chemoresistance and as a potential novel biomarker to predict the response to
FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (AIM.3).
The proposed study will uncover new mechanisms (i.e., tumor tissue-specific properties) that drive tumor
progression and PDAC chemoresistance with the ultimate intent (i) to find novel therapeutic avenues for PDAC
patients, (ii) to define the role of tumor architecture in PDAC chemoresistance, and (iii) discover new
FOLFIRINOX-predictive biomarkers to improve the dismal prognosis of PDAC patients."
10770449,"Antibody-Mediated Immunity to Borrelia burgdorferi
Summary
There is an urgent need to better understand mechanisms of immune protection and pathogenesis of Borrelia burgdorferi
(Bb), the causative agent of Lyme disease. This proposal aims to advances understanding of anti-Bb immunity and its
failure to clear Bb infections in its natural reservoir hosts. Antibodies control Bb infection, although they cannot clear the
infection. Binding of IgG to host cells via activating Fcg receptors (FcgR) and complement receptors (CR1/2) supports innate
cell-mediated destruction of pathogens and antigen presentation for adaptive immune response induction. In contrast,
engagement of the inhibitory FcgRIIb suppresses immune cell activation. It heightens B cell receptor-signaling thresholds,
causing enhanced B cell apoptosis and reduced GC and plasma cell development, but also supporting somatic
hypermutations. Quantitatively strong antibody responses to Bb infection are generated by plasmablasts in extrafollicular
foci, while GC responses are short-lived and non-functional. They fail to generate long-lived plasma cell and memory B
cells, and to sustain antibody affinity maturation to Bb and to co-administered antigens. The mechanisms underlying this
humoral immune deficiency are unknown, a key gap in knowledge this proposal aims to fill. Recent data demonstrated
changes to the ability of IgG from Bb-infected mice to bind to B cells and other APC, in part via the inhibitory FcgRIIb as
well as changes to the glycan profile of serum IgG collected over the course of Bb infection. FcgRIIb-deficient mice had
prolonged GC responses after Bb infection, while transfer of serum from Bb-infected, but not non-infected mice, induced
GC collapse in recipients. The objective of the proposal is to define critical IgG-immune cell interactions and their effects
on Bb infection, and to identify mechanisms of their regulation. The hypothesis will be tested that ineffective and/or
altered interactions of IgG with FcgRs reduce effective immunity to Bb. Aim 1 is to identify the mechanisms of IgG-
mediated B cell response regulation in Bb infection by studying FcgR-IgG interactions that regulate B cell responses, assess
humoral immunity in their presence and absence, and measure their effects on the course of Bb infection. Aim 2 is to
assess the effectiveness of IgG-B cell interaction for antigen-presentation and T-B interaction. Aim 3 is to identify the
mechanisms of altered FcgR binding by Bb-IgG, probing immune complex formation and IgG glycans modifications and
their effects on the passive protective capacity of anti-Bb IgG and/or the course of Bb-infection. Expected results would
identify changes to IgG-B cell interactions, as causes of suboptimal anti-Bb IgG immunity, enhancing understanding of the
pathogenesis of Bb and providing potential therapeutic targets for Lyme disease."

10904647,"As the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, suicide is an alarmingly prevalent public health problem.
The time period of highest risk for suicide and related behavior (SRB) is immediately (e.g., the weeks) following
psychiatric hospitalization. Effective and scalable strategies for preventing SRB among individuals recently
discharged from inpatient treatment are urgently needed. Encouragingly, brief evidence-based interventions now
exist that reduce risk for suicide after acute psychiatric care. A primary example is safety planning, which involves
developing a prioritized list of coping strategies and sources of support that people can use to mitigate future
suicidal crises; this intervention is now recommended as part of standard inpatient clinical care. However, it has
been shown that well over one-third of suicidal patients who have a safety plan never use it. Additionally, little is
known about when (and for whom) specific components of the safety plan, which includes internal coping
strategies, social support activities, and help-seeking behaviors, are most accessible and effective. Optimizing
real-world safety plan use with scalable intervention strategies delivered via mobile technology has great
potential to improve the effectiveness of an already promising intervention and advance precision treatment for
high-risk individuals. This project will employ the recently developed micro-randomized trial design to test the
effectiveness of brief, just-in-time interventions aimed to promote real-world use of the safety plan and its specific
components. Both the method (e.g., phone call or text messaging by a human or automated forms of
smartphone-based messaging) and content (e.g., recommendation to use the safety plan in its entirety or a
specific component) will be randomized according to individuals' current levels of suicidal urges and intent.
Participants will be psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicidal thoughts or behaviors who agree to participate in
an intensive longitudinal monitoring protocol involving real-time smartphone-based surveys for the 28 days after
hospitalization; after each completed survey, participants will be repeatedly “micro-randomized” to one of several
just-in-time interventions. We will test the hypotheses that brief interventions will be acceptable and feasible, and
associated with increased use of safety plan components (target mechanism) and reductions in suicidal thoughts
(proximal outcome) at high, medium, and low levels of suicidal thoughts, and that intervention effects will vary
by both intervention method and content. We will also explore internal and external contextual moderators (e.g.,
affect, social support) of proximal intervention effects, and collect qualitative data that will inform intervention
refinement as well as the future development and implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions. This
project is well-matched to the overall P50 Center emphasis on leveraging innovations in technology to improve
prediction and prevention of SRB during key care transition periods, and has the potential to provide new,
practice-ready knowledge on effective and scalable strategies for optimizing and tailoring evidence-based
interventions for those at elevated risk of suicide."
10825568,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Of an estimated 5.4 million older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in the
US, 67% reside in the community with unique and significant care needs. Medicare-funded Home Health (HH)
delivers skilled nursing, therapy, and personal care aide services in the patient’s home and is one of few
affordable and accessible options for home-based care among those with ADRD. Of the 3.4 million Medicare
beneficiaries who access HH each year, 31% have ADRD. HH patients with ADRD receive more intensive
care, yet are more likely to experience adverse outcomes including institutionalization and hospitalization.
Thus, there is critical need to develop tailored HH interventions to improve outcomes for patients with ADRD.
 In 87% of HH episodes, clinicians report needing family caregiver assistance to implement the plan of care
and engaging/supporting family caregivers during HH contributes to improved care outcomes—including
reduced readmission risk and greater patient and family satisfaction. Family caregivers are a crucial resource
for those with ADRD, including during HH. However, there is currently a dearth of information regarding ADRD
family caregivers’ specific roles and support needs during HH. Analyses of ADRD caregiver involvement in
care delivery have focused on the ambulatory setting and hold limited applicability for HH due to this setting’s
unique payment and care delivery structures. Prior work examining caregiver activities and training needs
during HH did not specifically examine those with ADRD. HH patients with ADRD (and their caregivers) merit
targeted study given: the unique challenges of ADRD caregiving, ADRD patients’ higher risk for adverse HH
outcomes, and prior work indicating that caregivers are more likely to need training during HH if assisting a
patient with cognitive impairment.
 The goal of this project is to describe ADRD caregivers’ role and training needs during HH, and to determine
how caregiver availability and capacity impact HH care delivery and outcomes for patients with ADRD.
Availability refers to caregivers’ willingness to assist and how often they are present in the home. Capacity
refers to caregivers’ identified training needs related to specific caregiving activities. We will use a national
sample of Medicare beneficiaries with diagnosed ADRD (determined via Medicare claims) who received HH in
2018. We will analyze linked HH patient assessment, Medicare claims, and HH agency administrative data for
this sample to 1) characterize caregiver involvement (including types of assistance provided, availability, and
capacity) during HH; 2) determine the impact of caregiver availability and capacity on HH care delivery for
patients with ADRD; and 3) assess the impact of caregiver availability and capacity on HH outcomes for
patients with ADRD. Findings will provide novel foundational evidence regarding ADRD caregivers’ role and
support needs during HH, informing the development of targeted interventions to improve care for HH patients
with ADRD by better engaging and supporting their family caregivers."
10784676,"Project Summary
The following aims are developed as the logical next step based on published and unpublished findings from the
parent grant (initiated by the late Dr. Traystman) to assess sex-specific signaling following pediatric (juvenile
mice) cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Pediatric cardiac arrest is surprisingly
common and remains poorly understood and understudied. We made significant progress on the major aims of
the previous grant cycle and obtained important new preliminary data that form the foundation for the current
aims. We take advantage of our novel juvenile mouse cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CA/CPR) model to assess functional outcomes and recovery following CA/CPR. Emerging evidence from our
laboratory, and others, indicate that alterations in the surviving functional networks contribute to cognitive
deficits. Synaptic plasticity, in the form of strengthening following physiological stimuli (long-term potentiation;
LTP) is a well-established cellular model of learning and memory. Deficits in hippocampal LTP correlate with
memory impairments in adult and juvenile mice and therefore, we focus on therapies that target reversing
synaptic plasticity deficit to enhance functional recovery (neuro-restoration). We recently made the
remarkable observation that juvenile mice exhibit endogenous neuro-restoration; recovery LTP
and memory function 14-30 days after CA/CPR, which we do not observe in adults exposed to the
same injury.
 Our data indicates that the impairments and endogenous recovery of synaptic plasticity and memory
function in juvenile mice correlates with expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Further, we
show that stimulation of BDNF-TrkB signaling facilitates recovery of hippocampal function. The recovery in
hippocampal function we observed in juveniles corresponds with hormonal maturation that occurs between
PND28-56. Our preliminary data indicates that gonadectomy of juvenile male (CAST) and female (OVX) mice
prevents recovery of LTP (and recovery of BDNF levels) following CA/CPR. Further, we observed that
replacement of sex steroids (estrogen in females and testosterone in males) restores endogenous neuro-
restoration in CAST/OVX juvenile mice. Importantly, we observe that estrogen stimulates BDNF expression in
juvenile females but not males and that brain estrogen does not facilitate recovery of LTP in males. Therefore,
our overarching hypothesis is that 1) increased steroid levels in the brain during puberty facilitate endogenous
neuro-restoration following juvenile CA/CPR through activation of sex-specific signaling (Aim 2 male-specific
androgen signaling and aim 3 female-specific estrogen receptor signaling) that converges on BDNF and other
plasticity gene expression to enhance synaptic plasticity. The proposed research will contribute to our
understanding of the mechanisms of functional impairments and recovery following cardiac arrest in the
pediatric age group, an understudied population. In particular, this project extends our long-standing research
focus regarding sex-specific signaling and the interaction between age, sex, sex steroids and outcomes following
brain injury. Further, our studies will extend our focus on developing therapeutic strategies to restore synaptic
function within surviving brain networks, rather than attempting to protect neurons from ischemic injury, which
may impact treatments of patients of all ages."
10841475,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Epigenetic systems regulate gene expression during reproduction and development and the misregulation of
these pathways leads to disease. Non-coding RNAs are major regulators and orchestrators of epigenetic
processes in all eukaryotes. For instance, non-coding RNA directs paramutation in plants, heterochromatin
formation in yeast, genome rearrangement in paramecium, and X-chromosome inactivation and imprinting in
mammals. Additionally, while most epigenetic information is erased each and every generation to ensure
totipotency of the germline, in some cases, epigenetic information escapes reprogramming and passes across
generations (termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance or TEI). Current evidence suggests that non-
coding RNAs are major informational vectors for TEI in plants, worms, insects, and, possibly, mammals. The
long-term goal of my research program is to understand how non-coding RNA regulates and sculpts gene
expression programs and how this regulation is, in some cases, passed across generations.
 We are using the metazoan model organism C. elegans to address these questions. To date our work
has identified a nuclear branch of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, which uses small interfering (si)RNAs
to regulate chromatin states and inhibit RNAP II elongation. We have also identified pathways and systems
required for transmission of epigenetic information across generations. Our recent studies have identified a new
type of membraneless organelle that houses proteins needed for TEI, identified two pathways that act as natural
breaks on TEI, and defined an underlying mechanism for TEI mediated by a new form of RNA modification that
we helped discover. And because we find that transposable elements are a major target of the C. elegans
epigenetic inheritance pathways, we theorize that one function of non-coding RNAs and TEI systems is to help
inoculate progeny against the expression of nucleic acid parasites.
 Deregulation of epigenetic pathways contributes to the etiology of a number of human diseases. The
extensive links existing between non-coding RNA and epigenetic processes in all eukaryotes suggests that the
work we are doing in C. elegans will lead to insights that will be applicable to all animals and, therefore may help
us understand and treat disease in people."

This T32 IMSD proposal aims to increase the pool of PhD scientists from underrepresented (UR)
backgrounds who contribute and have a significant impact on the health-related research needs of the
nation. The proposal builds on an R25 award, managed (1996-2013) by the former University of Medicine &
Dentistry of New Jersey, and since 2016 by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. From 1996-2013, the
program enrolled 89 students, of whom at least 86% are pursuing a research, science and/or medicine
career. Since 2016, IMSD appoints and trains UR students from 9 graduate programs (GPs) representing
all biological/biomedical disciplines across the Rutgers-New Brunswick campuses, with 21 students
currently in training. The IMSD partner programs have a robust pool of eligible applicants, committed and
productive faculty members, and resources to provide outstanding cutting-edge training in health-related
disciplines relevant to the NIH mission. The GPs provide their trainees broad knowledge and research
experiences needed to advance in their chosen fields, coupled with rigorous research design, data analysis
and interpretation. Students are trained to conduct research responsibly, ethically and with integrity, and to
think critically and independently. IMSD will play a central role in providing support, complementary to that
of the individual GPs, to promote the success of UR students, whether IMSD-funded or not. We are
requesting 5 NIH-funded predoctoral positions per year for 5 years, with 2 years of support for each trainee.
The IMSD trainees are integral to the community of UR predoctoral recruits who are funded using university
and GP resources. Aim 1 is to recruit, train and graduate with PhD UR trainees, with important metrics,
such as retention, time-to-degree and publication rate, comparable to or better than non-UR American
trainees, used to measure success. To this end, IMSD will provide: (1) close mentoring/advising; (2) a 0-
credit, required course in years 1-4 that will focus on annual student research presentations and related
professional and lay communication skills development; (3) career and skills development workshops; and
(4) an annual research symposium for trainees and mentors. IMSD activities will reinforce student training in
responsible conduct of research and standards/methods related to rigor and reproducibility. In Aim 2 we
will implement evidence-based and/or pilot strategies that improve the training and persistence of UR
graduate students, build scientific and professional identity, and increase awareness and readiness for
transition to productive and successful careers in biomedical research and research-related careers.
Programs will focus on: (1) student wellness; (2) development of writing and communication skills, including
submission of a fellowship application; (3) participation in career-oriented programs; and (4) community
engagement. In addition to the direct impact on our trainees, the IMSD, through its inclusion of all UR
students from GPs across the campus, will contribute strongly to a sense of community and belonging."
10775703,"Project Summary / Abstract:
Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart
muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be
categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic
cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a
thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to
mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic
plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common
to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death.
Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which
results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on
metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will
address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of
thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics
to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and
non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause
of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration
of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an
acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to
determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell
death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human
subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3
months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of
metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an
in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic
pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data-
dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in
plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non-
thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an
acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort."

A national child and adolescent mental health emergency was declared in fall 2021 amid rising mental health
challenges. Approximately one in six children have a professionally diagnosed mental health disorder, which
can lead to increased risk of suicide, worse health outcomes later in adulthood, and worse performance in
school. However, approximately half of children with mental health disorders do not receive treatment, and
Black, Hispanic, and low-income children, are less likely to receive mental health care than their peers. Schools
are one of the main places children readily access health services, including mental health care, and school
mental health services are often provided by licensed school counselors. Recently, there has been a push to
increase mental health services in schools and access to school counselors in particular. The proposed study
will examine one of the largest policies to increase funding for and access to school counselors in middle and
high schools. Specifically, we will study how California’s 2006 Supplemental School Counseling Program
(SSCP) impacted children’s access to school counselors, self-reported mental health outcomes, and related
health and well-being outcomes. The SSCP provided middle and high schools with funds to hire more certified
counselors, with funding levels that varied based on school sizes. We are not aware of any study that has
examined the causal impacts of this large-scale policy on the mental health and related health outcomes of
California students, or any related research examining the causal effects of a counseling policy of this scope on
children’s health. We will leverage variation in funding levels over time and across schools in a simulated
instruments and event study model to estimate the causal impacts of additional counselors hired through the
SSCP on health outcomes. Using administrative education data on schools, students, and personnel from the
California Department of Education, and self-reported measures of mental health, healthy behaviors, and
health outcomes from the California Healthy Kids Survey, we will 1) document how expanded funding for
school counselors impacted students’ access to counseling, including the number of counselors hired and their
education, experience, and demographics, 2) estimate the causal impact of expanded access to school
counselors on students’ health, including mental health, healthy behaviors, and well-being, and 3) examine
how access to school counselors and their impacts on children’s health vary by urbanicity, family income,
student race/ethnicity, and age. This research will provide evidence on how expanding access to school
counselors may improve children’s mental health and how to effectively design related policies so that they
impact the children most in need of these services. This is particularly important right now as places consider
whether and how to use COVID relief funding to hire more counselors, and people seek ways to address the
current national child and adolescent mental health emergency."

 Substance use and other psychiatric disorders result in enormous personal, healthcare, and economic
costs. Substance use (e.g., tobacco use disorder) and psychiatric (e.g., schizophrenia) disorders are highly
comorbid. Three main theories have been proposed to explain the high comorbidity of tobacco use and
schizophrenia: 1) self-medication (e.g., schizophrenia promotes tobacco use due to nicotine’s effect on reducing
cognitive deficits and medication side effects), 2) tobacco use causes schizophrenia, and 3) a shared liability,
due to shared genetic and environmental factors. Tobacco use and schizophrenia are each highly heritable (~60-
80%) and we and others have shown that they share several common genetic risk factors. Two traits may share
genetic risk factors due pleiotropy (i.e., a gene variant influences both traits) or because one disorder causes
the other. Furthermore, shared genetic risk may be present in all individuals (i.e., whole-group pleiotropy) or may
be restricted to a subset of individuals (i.e., sub-group heterogeneity).
 Using our expertise in tobacco use, biomarkers, schizophrenia, statistical genetics, and transcriptional
analyses, we will develop a comprehensive analytic pipeline to elucidate the shared genomic liability of tobacco
use and schizophrenia, and identify potential causal effects. Our study improves upon initial cross-disorder
analyses, and involves 1) obtaining data from the largest available genomics datasets of schizophrenia and
tobacco use, 2) examining genetic correlation between the traits, 3) identifying shared genetic variants, 4)
examining biological (i.e., mechanistic) pathways, 5) exploring functional effects of the shared genetic variants,
and 6) testing causal directions and effects of whole-group pleiotropy versus sub-group heterogeneity. In Aim 1,
we will become proficient in all 6 steps of the analytic pipeline by analyzing women and men together. In Aim 2,
we will conduct genome-wide sex-based analyses of tobacco use to determine the feasibility of using sex-based
genomic analyses in future investigations of concurrent psychiatric disorders. To develop the pipeline, we will
use nicotine intake biomarkers, which capture tobacco use more accurately than self-reported measures.
However, GWAS of self-reported traits or diagnostic criteria could be used when biomarkers are unavailable.
 This grant will train the young investigator PI for a larger genomics program investigating the shared
genomic liability and causality between other pairs of heritable and concurrent psychiatric disorders. We will
apply this pipeline to diverse populations as the datasets become available. Through these efforts, we will better
understand the biological vulnerability to developing co-occurring substance use and psychiatric disorders. This
work may lead to improved prevention and treatment approaches, as well as reveal novel targets for drug
discovery."

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit is a unique CTD sequence
(Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) repeated many times and is mostly conserved in eukaryotes. This domain coordinates the
recruitment of transcriptional factors to Pol II through its post-translational modifications, the loss of which
cripples the highly efficient transcription process and causes the cell to die. The accurate phosphorylation state
of different residues in the CTD heptad repeats by kinase and phosphatases is crucial to precisely recruiting
proteins to mediate the transcription process. Our lab utilizes our extensive experience in protein chemistry to
understand the precise pattern of phosphorylation during transcription by investigating the activity and specificity
of these kinases and phosphatases. We seek to understand how the post-translational modifications of CTD are
altered during biological events and how such changes are reflected in the outcome of transcription. We use
multi-disciplinary methods including structural biology, biochemistry, mass spectrometry methodology, and
global transcriptome analysis to investigate the molecular mechanism of how different modification states of RNA
polymerase II coordinate the eukaryotic transcription.
Equipped with extensive knowledge about the phosphatase function and activity, we further explore how the
chemical inhibition of SCP1, a human phosphatase belonging to HAD superfamily, thwarts some of the growth
glioblastoma cells. We utilized our experience in structural-based inhibitor design to identify covalent and non-
covalent inhibitors targeting this unique phosphatase."

Ribosomes are macromolecular machines that decode the genome. Quality control
mechanisms that ensure the fidelity of this process are thus of paramount importance cellular
and organismal viability. Ribosomes move at variable rates, slowing down or even pausing to
facilitate organelle targeting, domain folding and co-translational assembly, but prolonged stalls
are deleterious to cells because they can deplete functional ribosomes and produce highly toxic
truncated nascent chains. Stalls that occur on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ribosomes are even
more damaging because they additionally obstruct the translocons through which all secreted
and membrane proteins must transit en route to the secretory pathway. Ribosome quality
control (RQC) is a conserved and essential process that rescues stalled 60S subunits by
extracting the obstructing nascent chain and degrading it by the UPS. Despite immense
progress in the past decade in defining RQC for cytosolic ribosome, the how RQC operates for
ER-stalled ribosomes is almost completely uninvestigated. Recently my lab discovered that
UFMylation – the process by which UFM1, a small ubiquitin-like protein is conjugated to
ribosomes — plays a central and essential role specifically in adapting RQC to proteins
synthesized at the ER. The three specific aims described in this proposal seek to build on the
foundation provided by our extensive preliminary data to define the mechanism by which
nascent chains that obstruct ribosomes that stall on ER translocons are extracted and
degraded. In aim 1 we will conduct a systematic dissection of the RQC machinery to define the
role of known RQC required to resolve stalled ribosomes at the ER. In aim 2 we will define the
interplay between ribosome UFMylation and RQC and dentify the readers of UFMylated
ribosomes at the ER. In aim 3 we will determine the structure of UFMyulated ribosomes and the
E3 ligase that conjugates UFM1 to the ribosome."

Opportunistic fungal pathogens are a leading cause of healthcare associated bloodstream infections. Candida
yeasts, specifically, cause 80-90% of biofilm-associated invasive fungal infections and mortality rates can
approach 50%. Furthermore, the incidence of Candida infections is rising with the increased use of catheter and
other device-based interventions. To date, the majority of work related to fungal infections and potential
treatments has focused on biofilms and their prevention. However, recent evidence suggests that the dispersion
of yeast cells from the biofilm (into the bloodstream) and the persistence of these dispersed cells are
perhaps more important virulence factors and represent significant but underutilized treatment targets.
Further, existing assays and instrumentation are not amenable to measuring dispersion and phenotyping
dispersed cells. Nor do they recapitulate in vivo conditions (e.g. flow, interaction with host cells). Thus, here we
will develop a new type of under-oil open microfluidic system (UOMS) to quantify the dispersive capacity of
biofilms and assess the phenotype of dispersed cells in Candida mutants and clinical isolates. The UOMS
platform is built on the foundation of a newly observed phenomena called Exclusive Liquid Repellency (ELR).
ELR provides a unique environment where liquid is completely repelled from a solid surface to eliminate
biofouling. Additionally, ELR expands the capabilities of simple open microfluidic devices allowing us to
overcome the limitations of current methods and provide a system capable of quantitatively studying fungal
dispersion. We will first (Aim 1) develop an under-oil microchannel device to measure the dispersive capacity of
Candida biofilms and virulence phenotypes. Second (Aim 2) we will automate the UOMS and develop a single-
cell distribution assay to measure the phenotype of individual dispersed cells. And finally (Aim 3), we will use the
UOMS platform to develop dispersion phenotype profiles for Candida mutant libraries and clinical isolates. We
will measure the dispersive capacity and phenotype of dispersed cells from hundreds of Candida albicans clinical
isolates and mutants available in existing libraries, providing clues to the genetic determinants of dispersion."

Seasonal and epidemic conjunctivitis (pink eye) infections are highly contagious and impose significant
economic burden in the United States and worldwide. Long-term visual impairment can occur. In children,
conjunctivitis may herald more serious systemic complications leading to hospitalizations and even deaths.
Current challenges to effective mechanisms to curtail outbreaks are the lack of tracking and reporting, poor
access to sample collection for analysis, limited diagnostic testing capabilities, and an incomplete
understanding of the pathogens involved. The overall goal of this project is to combine international
collaboration efforts and advances in genomic technologies to identify pathogens, global trends, pathogen
evolution, and the immune responses involved in the epidemiology of conjunctivitis. We propose to enhance
the understanding of the pathogenesis of conjunctivitis with the following aims. The first aim will determine how
adenovirus genome types vary within a region and across regions. The second aim will identify emerging
causes of seasonal and epidemic conjunctivitis. Finally, we will identify the local immune response signatures
of children and adults with infectious conjunctivitis. We expect that conjunctival gene expression profiles will
accurately predict disease associated complications. This project has the potential to improve public health
surveillance, guide targeted interventions, improve vaccine development, and elevate existing diagnostic
paradigms for conjunctivitis, to reduce both the financial and ocular health burden worldwide."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of disorders that cause retinal degeneration. To date,
mutations in more than 58 genes have been linked to classic retinitis pigmentosa, and collectively all forms of
inherited retinal dystrophies involves at least 300 genes. My studies are focused on retinitis pigmentosa-59
(RP59), a non-syndromic autosomal recessive form of RP caused by mutations in the dehydrodolichyl
diphosphate synthase (DHDDS) gene, localized to exon 3 on chromosome 1p36.11. The most prevalent
mutation is K42E, while T206A and R98W also have been reported. We generated a murine Dhdds K42E knock-
in mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Preliminary data shows significant reduction of
ERG b-wave amplitudes and we have reported marked GFAP up-regulation, without retinal degeneration or
decreased protein N-glycosylation. This suggests that defective DHDDS-dependent retinal degeneration may be
more complicated than simply a loss-of-function mechanism due to altered protein glycosylation. To better
understand the basis for selective retinal pathology associated with RP59 mutations, we plan to characterize the
DhddsK42E/K42E knock-in mouse anatomically and physiologically. Additionally, we will create and analyze two new
models of DHDDS-related inherited retinal disease, Dhdds T206A/T206A and DhddsT206A/K42E. Studying the retina in
these mouse models will give us insight into the pathophysiology of this inherited disorder, and may lead to novel
treatment options for this disorder."

This project focuses on understanding the role that the unique physiology of bats plays in their ability to act as
host reservoirs for diseases that can spill over to humans. The project will be carried out under field conditions
in Uganda on three species of bats that have varying links to the spread of Ebola virus (EBOV) to humans. By
comparing the ability of these three species of bats to respond to Ebola-like immune challenges, this work will
help identify the characteristics that contribute to spillover risk. In the long term, this work will help identify host
species for EBOV and other related viruses that present risk to humans. It will also help explain how different
species of bats respond to different types of viral infections. The main focus of this project will be to identify
behaviors and molecular pathways that enable reservoir hosts to tolerate infections, providing critical insight
into one of the mechanisms that leads to spillover. This work is driven by the hypothesis that some bat species
have coevolved with particular types of viral infections and, therefore, have adapted mechanisms to minimize
pathology during infection. Bats are globally biodiverse and have many unique ecological and physiological
adaptations, including flight and the ability to employ both hypo- and hyperthermic body temperature
regulation. This project focuses on three bat species chosen because they are in close contact with humans,
their habitats cover the range of EBOV exposure risk, and they have divergent coevolutionary histories with
viral pathogens; two of the three species have significant ties to EBOV epidemiology. This project addresses
these questions under natural conditions in the field by taking the innovative approach of using EBOV virus-like
particles as a proxy for experimental infection with biohazardous pathogens. This project has three specific
aims that will allow the achievement of its goals. First, the project tests the hypothesis that specific African bat
species will display signatures of EBOV disease tolerance in response to challenge with EBOV virus-like
particles, and thus are likely to be natural reservoir hosts. These experiments will provide significant insight into
disease tolerance in bats and the potential identity of EBOV reservoir(s). Second, this project tests the
hypothesis that bats display variable levels of disease tolerance that depend upon innate immune pathways
that have undergone unique evolutionary selection in bats. Third, this project explores whether tolerance of
and resistance to viral infection are facilitated by the unique metabolic behaviors of bats, namely that they can
depress metabolism and enter torpor to conserve energy and can elevate metabolism and thus temperature
during flight. The role of changes in body temperature is poorly understood and these experiments will identify
whether these physiological responses contribute to immunological tolerance and resistance in important
disease reservoirs. Together, the successful completion of these goals will help determine whether infection
tolerance confers on African bat species the ability to serve as reservoir hosts for virulent zoonotic viruses and
will identify molecular, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to tolerance phenotypes."

Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a critical component of first-line tuberculosis (TB) therapy because it has dramatically
reduced relapse rates and treatment duration. PZA is weakly active in vitro, but potently sterilizing in vivo, due
to its outstanding activity against slow and non-replicating populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that are
phenotypically tolerant to most other TB drugs. Understanding the basis for the in vivo sterilizing activity of PZA
represents one of the most important unmet needs in TB drug discovery. While the mode of action of PZA
remains under investigation, our knowledge of factors that govern susceptibility and resistance has advanced
considerably in recent years. PZA is a pro-drug that must be converted to the active form of pyrazinoic acid
(POA) by the M. tuberculosis amidase PncA, and loss-of-function mutations in pncA account for at least 70%
of clinical resistance. Other genetic variations associated with resistance have been described, but most have
not been evaluated in isogenic strains to determine their role in resistance, and have not been assessed for
association with PZA resistance in animal models of infection. Importantly, PZA lacks antitubercular activity in
athymic nude mice, indicating a key role for T cell-mediated immunity in efficacy. Consistent with these
observations, our lab and others have shown that PZA is inactive against M. tuberculosis in resting
macrophages, but contributes to bacterial killing in macrophages activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-ɣ). Host-
dependent stressors that are associated with IFN-ɣ stimulation, such as exposure to low pH, nutrient limitation
and reactive oxygen species, have been implicated as contributors to PZA action. Our recent studies have
revealed a central role for specific M. tuberculosis stress responses in PZA conditional susceptibility. Through
these studies, we have identified a network of functions that modulates PZA susceptibility when expression of
the corresponding genes is altered. We have also identified specific host factors that contribute to PZA action
in macrophages and in infected mice. Based on these findings, we have identified means to bolster drug action
under conditions where PZA typically lacks activity. Through this proposal, we aim to characterize novel
molecular mechanisms for PZA resistance, determine host factors that modulate PZA susceptibility, and
assess opportunities in host- and microbe-targeted PZA potentiation. These studies will advance our
understanding of mechanisms that govern PZA susceptibility and resistance of M. tuberculosis. As a
substantial proportion of TB disease results from impaired T cell responses, it is of fundamental importance to
understand how these responses relate to PZA efficacy and how we can use this information to optimize PZA
action in the context of impaired immunity."
10890589,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Language and Emotions: Discovery and Clinical Translation (Project ൬)
In primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), symptoms can
reflect the neurodegeneration of language and emotion brain networks. Although recent clinical and basic
science evidence suggests there is substantial conceptual, mechanistic, and clinical overlap between the
domains of language and emotion, research on these areas has largely proceeded in parallel. In patients who
exhibit early alterations in both language and behavior, diagnostic accuracy can be limited because theoretical
and anatomical models of the language-emotion interface are lacking. A central hypothesis of this proposal is
that damage and decline in interacting language and emotion neural networks underlie symptoms in PPA,
bvFTD, and emotional semantic variant frontotemporal dementia (esvFTD), a newly defined syndrome. Studies
of PPA and bvFTD often do not include comprehensive assessments of both language and emotion systems
because evaluation of these domains typically requires specialized, time-intensive approaches. A more detailed
understanding of the clinical features that characterize these disorders at presentation, and the symptoms that
emerge over time, will facilitate differential diagnosis and help to predict neuropathological subtypes, a critical
step in the emerging era of molecular-specific therapies. Assessment tools that provide scalable, objective, and
ultimately automated, measures of language and emotion functioning will be needed before these approaches
can be used to monitor disease progression or treatment response in large-scale clinical trials. In the proposed
project, we will leverage existing clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data collected in previous PPG
cycles and will collect new language and emotion (i.e., autonomic nervous system activity, facial expression, and
emotional experience) data using innovative techniques. We will conduct three annual in-person evaluations and
five semiannual remote longitudinal assessments of language and emotion in patients with PPA, bvFTD, and
esvFTD and in age-matched healthy controls. We will use these data to refine current clinical conceptualizations
of these disorders and to investigate how neural system decline relates to language and emotion trajectories
across the clinical syndromes. We will also develop automated tools that extract objective measures of language
and emotion, which will make these approaches more accessible to the community. We will address three key
aims. In Aim ൬, we will advance current models of PPA, bvFTD, and esvFTD by integrating language and emotion
measures. In Aim ൭, we will map longitudinal decline in language, emotion, and associated brain structures and
networks in PPA, bvFTD, and esvFTD. In Aim ൮, we will create automated language and emotion tools that
facilitate diagnosis, track progression, and predict pathology. The proposed project will improve clinical care and
inform treatment in PPA, bvFTD, and esvFTD. Through detailed phenotyping of these neurodegenerative
syndromes, these studies will help to advance knowledge of the interacting neural systems that support language
and emotion."

This project aims to understand in molecular detail how fluid shear stress acting on endothelial
cells triggers mechanical activation of signaling pathways at cell-cell junctions. Published data
show that shear stress activates a PECAM1-dependent signaling pathway, Notch signaling and
Alk1-Endoglin-Smad1/5 signaling, all of which occur at and depend on cell-cell contacts. These
pathways play major roles in vascular embryonic development, postnatal physiology and adult
disease. However, much remains to be learned about molecular mechanisms. The proposed
work is based on two recent advances in our labs. First, we have recently identified latrophilins
(LPHNs, also known as ADGRLs), members of the adhesion G protein coupled receptors
family, as key upstream mediators of shear activation of all three of these pathways. Second,
we have developed a new nanodevice that utilizes DNA origami to apply defined mechanical
tension to proteins. Aim 1 will investigate (1) the molecular mechanisms by which LPHNs
mediate the effects of shear stress on junctional signaling and (2) determine the role of LPHN2
in vascular development and function in vivo by doing endothelial-specific knockout in mice.
Aim 2 will use the DNA origami device to apply defined tension to PECAM1 and visualize
protein conformation change via cryoEM. These experiments will allow us to determine the
effect of applied force on PECAM’s structural transitions. Together, the project will provide new
understanding at unprecedented depth concerning how endothelial cell-cell junctional proteins
respond to mechanical force generated by shear stress.

10793494,"Sperm and egg cells carry genetic and epigenetic information from parents to offspring, serving as a link between the past, present and future of a species. Unlike oocytes and somatic cells, which package their DNA with histones, the DNA of mature sperm is bound by protamines, highly basic and rapidly evolving proteins that are essential for the compaction of paternal chromatin. This differential packaging traces back >500 million years, yet its biological and evolutionary significance remains unknown. Protamines have thus far been considered passive structural elements that hyper condense and protect paternal DNA, however emerging biochemical, evolutionary, and developmental evidence calls for a need to revisit protamine proteins’ biological function. We have employed cutting-edge molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of protamines in fertility, early development, and evolution. Together, the findings presented here will increase our molecular understanding of these ancient, yet rapidly evolving proteins and may overturn the long-held dogma of their presumed function."
10734072,"Abstract
The canonical and noncanonical inflammasome signaling pathways can induce pyroptosis and secretion of
inflammatory cytokines, which function as crucial immune defense mechanisms in microbial killing and
clearance. Pyroptosis is a type of regulated lytic cell death that is mediated by members of the gasdermin family
that assemble membrane pores upon cleavage by proteases. Gasdermin E (GSDME) can be cleaved by
apoptotic caspases-3 and 7, which then triggers plasma membrane pore formation and pyroptosis instead of
apoptosis. GSDME-mediated pyroptosis and cytokine release play crucial roles in host defense against viral or
bacterial infections. On the other hand, GSDME in intestinal epithelial cells has been implicated in mucosal
inflammation and pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease, and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis contributes to renal
fibrosis and kidney injury. Despite recent progress in our understanding of the recruitment and recognition of
gasdermin D (GSDMD) by inflammatory caspases, the molecular mechanisms of GSDME recognition and
cleavage by apoptotic caspases have been poorly defined. This proposal aims to address the critical gaps in our
knowledge using complementary structure-function approaches. We hypothesize that inactive GSDME is
maintained in an autoinhibited conformation through intramolecular amino-terminal domain (NTD)-carboxy-
terminal domain (CTD) interactions, which is recognized by apoptotic caspase-3 that cleaves at the NTD-CTD
linker region to release the autoinhibition. This study will explore the structural mechanisms of GSDME
autoinhibition and its recognition by caspase-3 to test the above hypothesis. The following specific aims are built
on our past and ongoing studies on gasdermins and pyroptosis. Aim 1 will characterize the molecular
mechanisms of GSDME autoinhibition. Our preliminary data show that GSDME protein can be crystallized and
the crystals diffracted X-ray well. We will determine the structure of GSDME at its autoinhibitory state using
crystallographic approaches, and validate the NTD-CTD interface through mutagenesis studies of the interface
residues using LDH release, PI uptake, and liposome leakage assays. Aim 2 will define the mechanisms of
GSDME recognition by caspase-3. We will probe the interaction between GSDME and caspase-3 through
biochemical and cell biology techniques, and determine the structure of GSDME in complex with caspase-3
using X-ray crystallography. The success of this proposal will not only reveal important insights into GSDME
autoinhibition and recognition by apoptotic caspases that move the field forward, but also facilitate the
development of specific inhibitors for apoptotic caspase-3 based on the distinct GSDME-caspase-3 interface,
which may be valuable reagents in the study of both pyroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways."

The overall goal of this project is to understand how myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) regulates
contraction and relaxation in skeletal muscles. 3 distinct paralogs of MyBP-C encoded by 3 separate
genes, MYBPC1, MYBPC2, and MYBPC3, are expressed in slow twitch skeletal muscle, fast twitch
muscle, and cardiac muscle, respectively. Of the three, the cardiac paralog has been most intensively
studied because mutations in MYBPC3 are the most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM). However, like MYBPC3, it is now clear that mutations in MYBPC1 and MYBPC2 are
increasingly linked to congenital skeletal muscle diseases such as distal arthrogryposis and more
recently to a new class of familial muscle tremors. Despite this, it has been challenging to disentangle
the distinct functional roles of the 2 skeletal paralogs of MyBP-C in part because most skeletal muscles
contain a mixture of slow and fast fiber types and because MyBP-C1, expressed in slow twitch fibers,
undergoes extensive alternative splicing resulting in a family of differentially expressed proteins each
with unique functional effects. As a result, it has been nearly impossible to distinguish the functional
significance of each variant in the context of working muscles. To overcome these challenges, the PI’s
lab recently developed a novel “cut and paste” approach to selectively target and replace different
MyBP-C paralogs in muscle sarcomeres. The method, first developed for MYBPC3, relies on the use
of gene-edited mice that express a tobacco etch virus protease (TEVp) consensus site and a “SpyTag”
sequence within cardiac MyBP-C so that when detergent-permeabilized myocytes are treated with
TEVp MyBP-C is selectively cleaved. Next, MyBP-C can be replaced with any recombinant protein
(containing any desired sequence modification) as long as the recombinant protein encodes a
“SpyCatcher” sequence because SpyCatcher and SpyTag from an instantaneous covalent bond. Here,
we expanded the method by creating “SpyC1” mice that allow us to selectively study slow skeletal
MyBP-C (Aim 1) and “SnoopC2” mice to study fast skeletal MyBP-C (Aim 2). Preliminary data using
the cut and paste method has already yielded new insights into how MyBP-C dysfunction can lead to
muscle tremors and additional results from these studies will determine the functional significance of
each MyBP-C paralog and how mutations in MyBP-C cause disease."

 The thesis of this R35 Program is that immune cell derived “pathogenic exosomes” are
key players in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and that their role can be
modeled in a smoking mouse model of exosome transfer to attain novel understanding of the
disease which can in turn be applied to COPD. This R35 Program is at the cutting edge of
innovation having discovered the existence of alpha-1 antitrypsin (α-1AT) resistant neutrophil
elastase (NE)+ neutrophil (PMN)-derived exosomes in COPD patients. In doing so, the Program
has challenged the concept that protease activity is solely solution phase and shown
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolytic activity is hugely enhanced by protease attachment to the
extracellular vesicle (EV) surface. Consequently, we: i) describe what appears to be the first EV
that can transfer a COPD-like phenotype from humans to mice; ii) elucidate a new mechanism
by which proteases escape anti-protease inactivation, leading to ECM degradation and cell
death via receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3); iii) describe a new model that transfers
a COPD phenotype from cigarette smoke (CS) exposed mice to naïve mice via immune cell-
derived exosomes; iv) use the mouse model to discover a new CS induced protective
mechanism against exosomal damage as well as a mechanism for exosomal self-propagation;
v) uncover new therapeutic targets for exosomal damage and; vi) translate the new findings to
better understand disease in COPD patients and smokers.
 Another highly significant aspect of this research Program is training/mentoring. In the
past ten years, which includes the PI's inaugural R35 grant, the PI has been or is currently
mentor to two PhD students, five medical students, an MD/PhD student, six K awardees, four
postdoctoral trainees, a pulmonary fellow, and a cardiology fellow. The PI currently mentors
seven junior faculty members. Overall, our Program is both multidisciplinary – employing
chemistry, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, animal physiology, etc. – and translational
in pairing basic scientists with physician scientists. Our team and trainees fulfill the NHLBI/NIH
mission to have diversity by including African American, Latina, Asian, and Caucasian
members. Our program fulfills all four goals of the NHLBI Strategic Vision by: a) elucidating a
new exosomal aspect of human biology; b) reducing human disease by new therapeutic
development against the exosomal pathway; c) developing a work force and an animal model
exosome resource and; d) translating the exosome research to human disease."

Residue-specific, reversible protein ADP-ribosylations regulate a broad range of biological processes, including
DNA damage responses, gene expression, and cell death. Therefore, homeostasis of cellular ADP-
ribosylations is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases (ARHs) are a
family of metalloenzymes that regulate site-specific ADP-ribosylations. ARH3 specifically reverses poly(ADP-
ribose) and mono-ADP-ribosylation at serine, a major site for modification following DNA damage, whereas
ARH1 cleaves mono-ADP-ribosylation at arginine. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding of
substrate selectivity, catalysis, and function of specific activities of ARHs, which is largely due to the lack of
quantitative and convenient tools and insufficient structural information on substrate-bound active forms. The
objective of this application is to develop novel quantitative assays that selectively measure the reversal of
residue-specific ADP-ribosylations and to elucidate the mechanism of substrate selectivity and the role of each
enzymatic activity of ARH3. In support of this objective, we have developed a highly sensitive, quantitative, and
convenient fluorescence-based assays that specifically monitor the reversal of poly(ADP-ribose) or serine
mono-ADP-ribosylation by ARH3. We have also determined initial structures of ARH3 bound to intact
substrates. Guided by these strong preliminary data, we will pursue three specific aims to test our hypothesis
that the metal-coordination states and unique structural plasticity of ARHs are linked to substrate selectivity
and efficient catalysis. In Aim 1, we will fully develop quantitative fluorescence-based assays that selectively
monitor the reversal of residue-specific mono-ADP-ribosylations. In Aim 2, we will determine the structural
bases for the specific substrate recognition and cleavage by ARHs. In Aim 3, we will identify ARH3 separation-
of-function mutants to define the role of each enzymatic activity of ARH3. Our studies will provide new
quantitative tools to study diverse ADP-ribosylation-metabolizing enzymes in nature and advance our
understanding of the mechanisms and functions of ARHs as essential processes for maintaining life."

 Astrocytes are versatile glial cells that regulate diverse processes in the central nervous system (CNS).
Roles for astrocytes during disease are complex and include both protective and pathologic functions. Recently,
distinct astrocyte activation states have been described, though the molecular mechanisms that govern astrocyte
polarization during neurotropic viral infection are not well understood. Here, we propose that receptor-interacting
protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) is a previously unappreciated driver of inflammatory astrocyte activation during viral
infection of the CNS. While roles for RIPK3 in programmed cell death have been extensively characterized, our
published work has described pleiotropic, cell death-independent functions for this pathway in the coordination
of protective neuroinflammation during viral encephalitis. In preliminary studies, we now show that RIPK3
signaling in astrocytes is required for survival and virologic control following challenge with Zika virus, an
emerging neurotropic pathogen of global concern. Using a combination of novel mouse genetic tools, we will
elucidate roles for RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes by 1) Defining profiles of expression, activation, and antiviral
function for astrocytic RIPK3; 2) Determining roles for astrocytic RIPK3 signaling in coordinating
neuroinflammation; and 3) Defining key substrates and transcriptional outputs of RIPK3 signaling in astrocytes.
Together, our studies promise to identify new molecular mechanisms governing protective neuroimmune function
during viral encephalitis."

The main goal of this grant proposal titled “Fortilin, CTNNA3, and the Heart” is to test the central
hypothesis that the inability of the failing heart to maintain fortilin expression leads to decreased
CTNNA3 transcription, increased CTNNA3 protein degradation, and lethal heart failure (HF). Nearly 6
million Americans live with HF, with about 670,000 new cases diagnosed each year. HF is a relentlessly
progressive disease that is associated with an unacceptably high death rate—about 40% of patients with
severe HF die within a year. The attempts to slow HF progression by overexpression of sarcoplasmic reticulum
calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), or adenylyl cyclase type 6 (AC6) in humans
using adeno associated virus (AAV) have been unsuccessful. New molecular targets for development of HF
therapeutics must be identified. Although fortilin, a multifunctional 172-amino acid protein, is one of the most
abundantly expressed proteins in the hearts, its role in the heart remained unknown when we found that the
myocardial samples from HF patients expressed significantly less fortilin than in those from control patients. To
test whether decreased fortilin levels in the failing hearts is the cause or effect of HF, we generated heart-
specific fortilin knockout (KO) mice. These mice rapidly develop severe HF and die within 9 weeks of age. Non-
biased systematic microarray analyses from KO and wild-type mouse hearts showed that the expression of
CTNNA3, which encodes a protein also known as α-T-catenin that is a component of the intercalated disc (ID),
was severely decreased in the hearts of KO mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed disrupted IDs in
the hearts of KO mice. Strikingly, further molecular analyses revealed that fortilin binds CTNNA3 and that
fortilin transcriptionally activates the CTNNA3 gene. We have assembled a team with all expertise needed
to test the hypothesis that fortilin prevents HF by maintaining CTNNA3 expression and the integrity of
ID in the heart. We will first confirm that fortilin positively regulates CTNNA3 at both protein and mRNA levels
using cell-based assays. Additionally, using at least 300 de-identified human heart lysates from HF patients
and healthy hearts, we will evaluate the correlation between fortilin and CTNNA3 protein expression (Aim 1).
We will then attempt to rescue the HF phenotype of the KO mice by replenishing fortilin or CTNNA3 by either
AAV-mediated delivery or by crossing the KO mice with CTNNA3 transgenic mice (Aim 2). Finally, we will test
if the transgenic overexpression of fortilin in the hearts of mice protects them against ischemia-induced and
pressure-overload-induced through CTNNA3 (Aim 3). Upon completion of the project, we will have fully
evaluated the role of fortilin in HF, elucidated the mechanism by which fortilin deficiency causes the
heart to fail, and established a sound strategy to reverse the progression of HF by replenishing fortilin
and/or CTNNA3 in the failing heart."

Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the human stomach of half the world and approximately a third of the
US population. H. pylori induces inflammation in all hosts and 10-20% of those infected will present with
severe disease including peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma. All H. pylori associated diseases
depend on the ability of this organism to establish a persistent infection and induce chronic inflammation.
Chronic inflammation in the stomach can lead to additional tissue changes including atrophic gastritis (loss
of acid-producing parietal cells), spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), intestinal
metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia that increase risk for adenocarcinoma. In the prior funding period, we
documented genetic adaptation of H. pylori strains to these tissue changes during chronic human infection
using a combination of whole genome sequence analysis, extensive phenotyping and molecular variant
tracking in clinical and population-based samples. We also showed that H. pylori actively modulates the
immune microenvironment through collateral delivery of proinflammatory cell envelope associated
metabolites during secretion of the toxin CagA via the Cag Type IV Secretion System (T4SS). These data
combined with clinical data revealing higher rates of metachronous cancer after early cancer resection in
individuals with sustained Hp infection lead us to rethink the model of H. pylori carcinogenesis beyond its
role as an initiator of inflammation. We propose that H. pylori promotes carcinogenesis through
continual remodeling of the tissue environment to create a favorable niche for long term persistence
and transmission. Thus, H. pylori disease is a by-product of the interaction between bacterial factors
necessary for establishing and maintaining infection for transmission and resultant host defenses. In our
renewal we propose to leverage these culture collections and newly developed mouse models to elucidate
the genetic mechanisms that drive these adaptations and the resultant phenotypic changes that accompany
metaplastic progression. Our specific aims are to 1) Identify adaptive genetic variation during chronic
infection and preneoplastic tissue changes, 2) Examine phenotypic changes during chronic infection and
adaptation to distinct niches and 3) Evaluate the interplay between the epithelial and myeloid compartment
in Cag T4SS dependent innate immune activation, bacterial control, and tissue remodeling.
Our study of the genes and mechanisms contributing to chronic colonization will identify the mediators of H.
pylori persistent infection. Our studies of genetic variation during stomach infection will show how these
mediators adapt during the chronic inflammation that leads to severe disease (cancer)."
10816395,"Abstract: Despite the more than 100 years since the recognition of intrinsic spinal locomotor circuits, many of
the functional details of those circuits and their contributions to recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI)
remain to be determined. Recent development of powerful molecular tools enables functional dissection of
neural circuitry via reversibly silencing neurotransmission and trans-synaptic labeling. We will combine these
tools with sophisticated gait and kinematic analyses, that includes the full repertoire of speed dependent gaits,
to provide the functional and anatomical information necessary for building and refining an advanced neuro-
biomechanical computer model of the rat spinal cord, body and limbs. We will focus on two classes of spinal
cord interneurons, the long ascending (LAPNs) and descending (LDPNs) propriospinal neurons, that
interconnect the forelimb and hindlimb circuits and central pattern generators in the two enlargements, and
investigate their role in the intact spinal cord and after SCI using both hemisection and contusion models. Our
preliminary data show that these LAPNs/LDPNs are essential components involved in speed-dependent gait
expression. Silencing these neurons partially decouples the right and left limbs at each girdle. Surprisingly,
silencing these neurons after an incomplete contusion injury results in better overground locomotion, a result
that is hard to reconcile based on current knowledge and observations in uninjured animals. Using viral-based
trans-synaptic labeling we will determine the sensory, descending and propriospinal inputs onto both LAPNs
and LDPNs. We will utilize both existing and new physiological and biomechanical data (Aim 1) as well as new
anatomical data (Aim 2) to build and refine our computational model (Aim 3). Then, in vivo experiments and
computer modeling will be performed in parallel (Aim 4) to determine the roles that ipsilateral and commissural
LAPNs and LDPNs play in locomotor behavior, including the full range of locomotor gaits, and in recovered
function after hemisection and incomplete contusion injuries. We suggest that a deeper understanding of long
propriospinal neurons represents an important step towards the development of new therapeutic tools for
recovery after SCI."

Nearly 25% of Americans aged 65 and older have Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and more than half have
elevated hemoglobin A1c indicating impaired glucose tolerance, or prediabetes. T2DM can affect the brain
through neuronal toxicity of hyper- and hypoglycemia episodes, microvascular insults, impaired glucose
transfer and insulin resistance. The neurologic impact of T2DM is widespread and can lead to structural,
functional, and metabolic brain changes. Clinically, T2DM is associated with faster cognitive decline and a
higher risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The link between T2DM-associate brain changes
and cognitive decline is not completely understood, resulting in a paucity of targets for therapeutic intervention.
One potential target is cortical plasticity itself, the mechanisms of which can be assessed in vivo in humans
using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This approach uses single-pulse TMS to index cortical
excitability and a form repetitive TMS called intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to induce NMDA-
receptor dependent changes in cortical excitability that resemble the synaptic mechanisms of long-term
potentiation (LTP) plasticity. In a previous NIH-funded study (R21 NS082870), which serves as the foundation
for the current proposal, we used this TMS-iTBS approach to show that older adults with T2DM had reduced
LTP-like plasticity compared to healthy controls. Moreover, plasticity in T2DM patients was associated with
both cognition and cortical glutamate metabolism as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
We performed these TMS and MRS assessments in the motor cortex (M1) using electromyography to record
the output of TMS as a motor evoked potential (MEP). The current study seeks to extend these findings to
brain regions more directly involved in cognition, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
inferior parietal lobule (IPL). We will combine TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) and use the TMS-
evoked EEG potential (TEP) to index cortical excitability and its modulation by iTBS. Our pilot data supports
this approach by showing that iTBS to M1 induces correlated changes in MEPs and TEPs and that the iTBS-
induced modulation of TEPs in DLPFC and IPL are associated with tests of executive function and memory,
respectively. Our hypothesis is that cognitive dysfunction in T2DM is associated with abnormal glutamatergic
neurotransmission, which can be assessed using TMS and MRS. We will perform these assessments in non-
demented older patients with T2DM and demographically similar non-diabetic participants, divided into healthy
and prediabetic subgroups on the basis of A1c levels. We will collect structural magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) measures of cortical atrophy and comprehensive neuropsychological testing, plus data on known AD risk
factors, such as apolipoprotein-E4 status and plasma amyloid-beta levels. If successful, this study will identify
neurophysiological markers of cognitive impairment that are potentially modifiable and could thus be translated
into therapeutic targets for interventions to slow cognitive aging in T2DM and reduce the risk of developing AD."

This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposal will develop Dr. Greta Bushnell’s career
as an independent investigator, and enable her to advance into a new line of research focused on evaluating
misuse and abuse related morbidity of medicines prescribed to young people and the policies and practices that
can mitigate these harmful outcomes. This new direction of research requires distinct training in substance abuse
policy, misuse and abuse liability of prescription drugs, adolescent development of substance use, analysis of
state-level policies, and advanced methods to address confounding control. With a training program supported
by an experienced team of investigators, Dr. Bushnell will complete the proposed research, filling key gaps
surrounding benzodiazepine (BZD) misuse and abuse related harms in young people and modifiable factors to
reduce these harms. This research focus comes at a pertinent time of rising BZD-related morbidity, continued
prescribing, lack of safety data in youth at developmental risk for substance use problems, and current
opportunities to leverage opioid-related policies to reduce BZD-related harms. Overdose deaths involving BZDs
significantly increased in recent years with »11,500 deaths in 2017, partially attributed to the opioid crisis, and in
adolescents and young adults there were »39,000 emergency department visits for BZD-related poisonings in
2016. Despite BZDs being frequently prescribed to adolescents (3%) and young adults (6%), there are no
estimates on overdose risk following BZD treatment and it is unknown whether and to what extent BZD
prescribing to youth inadvertently increases risk of BZD or other substance misuse later in life. Prescription drug
monitoring programs (PDMPs) represent a potentially important, but understudied, means to mitigate BZD-
related morbidity. PDMPs are state-run surveillance systems collecting patient details on prescriptions for
controlled substances with capabilities to detect risky prescribing. Dr. Bushnell will use large, national
administrative claims data (2000-2018) covering privately and publicly insured young people (10-29 years) to
evaluate whether selected state PDMP features decrease BZD-related harms and risky BZD prescribing in young
people (Aim 1). To evaluate individual-level risks, she will quantify overdose risk following BZD treatment in
young people compared to alternative treatments and by prescription details (Aim 2) using the national claims
datasets with measures from Area Health Resources Files. She will then evaluate whether adolescent BZD
treatment increases downstream risks of BZD misuse or harmful substance use in early adulthood (Aim 3) using
the nationwide Monitoring the Future sample of high school seniors with panel surveys into early adulthood
(»2,450/year, 1976-2016). The proposal will inform an R01 submission on identifying youth-specific risk factors
in the progression from treatment with BZDs, or other controlled substances, to abuse and leveraging this
knowledge to inform interventions. Addressing these questions and developing this new line of research are only
feasible with intensive training, support, and protected time, which the K01 can provide."

Robust animal models of coronavirus infection are required for pre-clinical assessment of candidate vaccines
and therapeutic antibodies to prevent coronavirus infection and disease. The goal of the Animal Model Core
is to provide a central resource of animal models and virological tools to assess the effectiveness of vaccines
and antibody therapies against betacoronaviruses in multiple animal models of infection. An experienced team
of investigators will utilize established hamster, mouse, and ferret models of betacoronavirus infection to
determine the efficacy of candidate therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed by Project 1 and
vaccines developed by Project 2. Pre-immune and transmission models will be utilized to stringently test the
lead candidate vaccines. The Animal Model Core will also establish novel animal infection models with SARS-
CoV-2 variant viruses, and a novel ferret model of OC43 embecovirus infection. The Animal Model Core will
also complete virus neutralization assays for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV for all PLUTO investigators,
centralizing resources for these viruses, eliminating redundant biosafety and Select Agent approvals. The
Animal Model Core will serve as an innovative resource to assess efficacy of leading vaccine and mAb
candidates for the PLUTO program through the following three Specific Aims. 1) Establish and maintain
animal models of sarbecovirus and merbecovirus infection. 2) Establish and maintain coronavirus pre-immune
animal models. 3) Expand and improve animal models of embecovirus and sarbecovirus infection. These
complementary aims will enable rigorous assessment of vaccines and mAbs developed by the PLUTO
Projects and develop new animal models of betacoronavirus infection for the project and respiratory virus
research community. The novel pre-immune models will also provide data and samples to improve
understanding of the impact of pre-existing betacoronavirus immunity on subsequent vaccination and infection.
The outcomes of the Animal Model Core will have a positive impact on the success of the PLUTO program
and provide novel information and research tools for the broader research community."

Overview: MDRO Carriage, Transmission, Sequelae, and Prevention in Nursing Homes
 This P01 Program proposal will address critically important questions surrounding the expanding
problem of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in nursing homes (NH). Of the 1.4 million residents residing
annually in 15,000 U.S. NHs, more than half (65%) are estimated to harbor MDROs. These MDROs not only
impact medically vulnerable residents in NHs, but they can spread to surrounding hospitals and long-term care
facilities, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite growing evidence that NHs are major reservoirs of
MDROs, investments to address MDROs in this health sector are lacking. Little is known about sources or
drivers of MDRO transmission, and identification of effective interventions is needed.
 This program integrates expertise in infectious diseases, epidemiology, microbiology, pathogen
genomics, human microbiome, statistics, systems science, health economics, and agent-based models to
conduct an unprecedented set of studies on five MDROs in NHs – methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers (ESBLs),
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and the newly-emerged resistant fungus, Candida auris. By
leveraging previous and newly-conducted studies, this program will provide one of the largest compilations of
MDRO isolates from NH residents and environmental fomites. A total of 16,000 MDRO isolates and 3,000
metagenomic samples from 50 NHs will be studied using epidemiology, genomics, and simulation modeling as
distinct and synergistic vantage points to elucidate 1) best sampling methods for MDRO carriage and co-
carriage, 2) key sources and drivers of MDRO transmission, 3) major risk factors associated with carriage,
infection, and hospitalization, and 4) high-yield interventions to inform infection prevention policies to mitigate
adverse health outcomes due to MDROs in NHs."

Data Sciences and Statistics Core
 The Data Sciences and Statistics Core (DSSC) will be a multi-site core that integrates experts in data
management, biostatistics, epidemiology and pathogen genomics. First, the DSSC will serve as an inventory
hub for all data associated with this program, including sample inventory, epidemiologic data, and microbial
genomic sequence data. With complex epidemiologic data and terabytes of genomic sequence data from over
16,000 isolates and nearly 3,000 plate metagenomes, a detailed inventory is essential to ensure organized
access. Second, the DSSC will be a data sharing hub across all Projects. The DSSC will be responsible for
facilitating secure and frictionless data transfer between Projects, maintaining consistent nomenclature across
data types, as well as detailed data dictionaries. This resource will be essential to enable synergistic
collaboration between researchers across multiple institutions and projects, working with large, complex
datasets. Third, the DSSC will serve as an innovation hub for integrating biostatistics traditionally used for
epidemiologic studies with computational biology for genomic analysis. Researchers with expertise in statistical
modeling, epidemiology and bioinformatics will work closely to develop novel methodology for the
simultaneous analysis of complex epidemiological and genomic data. The DSSC will provide data science and
biostatistical expertise across all projects. This will enhance the synergy among the projects by unifying data
and statistical consultation. In convening an integrated core with expertise in biostatistics, computational
biology, epidemiology, and genomics, we will form a unique and powerful platform for developing novel
approaches and provide the clearest view of multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) carriage and transmission
within nursing homes (NHs) to date."

Project 2: Evaluating MDRO Transmission Patterns in Nursing Homes Using Pathogen Genomic Data
 MDRO infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for residents in nursing homes (NHs),
and these facilities are increasingly recognized as hubs for the rise and spread of MDROs into hospitals and
the wider community. Thus, there is an urgent need to be able to sensitively detect, trace and control
transmission of MDROs in NHs to limit their impact on residents and the healthcare ecosystem. Despite this
need, MDRO dynamics are poorly characterized in this setting. Risk factors for MDRO carriage may not
correspond to drivers of MDRO transmission. High pathogen prevalence may be fueled by (i) external
importation with admission; (ii) environmental reservoirs; or (iii) inter-person transmission, each requiring
distinct measures to reduce pathogen burden. It is also likely that transmission dynamics will differ
considerably between organisms, and thus certain interventions may have a differential impact on distinct
MDROs. Genomic surveillance of MDROs in NHs is thus urgently needed to complement studies of carriage
and prevalence by providing insight into the major drivers of spread within facilities. To address this gap, we
will assess the roles of human and environmental pathogen reservoirs contributing to MDRO transmission in
nursing homes in order to optimize sampling for genomic surveillance. We will develop integrative models
leveraging prospective genomic and epidemiological data from host and environmental sources collected
within an optimized multi-modal sampling framework to assess the spread and persistence of MDROs in NHs.
Furthermore, we will evaluate commensal organism sharing patterns in NHs using metagenomic sequence
data to resolve further microbial transmission networks. As part of a highly integrated framework with the other
P01 Projects and Cores, these studies will lead to a more comprehensive view of MDRO transmission patterns
in NHs using pathogen genomic data, including a new analytical framework for genomic assessment of
endemic pathogen transmission. This work will advance infection prevention and control strategies to detect,
trace and eliminate high risk transmission pathways, thus reducing the burden of MDROs in NHs, connected
healthcare facilities and the community."

Project 3: Simulating the Spread and Control of Multiple MDROs
Across a Network of Nursing Homes in a Region
 Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) cause nearly 3 million healthcare-associated infections (HAIs),
which are a major cause of death in US nursing homes (NHs), annually. While MDROs are commonly studied
in isolation, these pathogens circulate simultaneously, and their spread and prevention may affect and
compound each other. Therefore, determining the value of such strategies in NHs requires an understanding of
how they would affect colonization and infection risks of various MDROs simultaneously. Moreover, the impact
of MDROs and their prevention and control strategies extend beyond individual NHs and involve the dynamic
ecosystem of NHs in a region. Computational modeling that integrates epidemiologic, operational, and
economic components can help delineate the circulation and impact of multiple MDROs, test various
prevention and control strategies, and determine the subsequent ecosystem-wide effects related to
transmission and disease burden in ways that can save time, effort, and resources. The overall goal of this
proposed project is to elucidate (1) the combined effects of multiple MDROs spreading simultaneously
and (2) how policies and interventions (e.g., contact precautions, decolonization) may have an impact
across a variety of MDROs at the same time, using agent-based models (ABMs) of NHs in Orange
County (OC), California (CA). These detailed representations of NHs will include and help differentiate
among various multi-level factors affecting MDRO spread. This modeling Project will proceed in a synergistic,
iterative manner with the other two Projects. Model results will guide data collection and analyses for Projects 1
and 2, and data insights from Projects 1 and 2 will guide further refinement of the models. Shifting the focus
from one MDRO at a time to various MDROs collectively will help decision makers choose the best
overall infection control strategy. Specific Aim 1 will develop ABMs for each of the 70 nursing NHs in OC,
CA simulating how multiple MDROs (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant
enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacterales, and Candida auris) interact among carriers and co-carriers to promote spread. Specific Aim
2 will evaluate how different pathogens, host factors (e.g., comorbidities, wounds, bedbound status), and room
characteristics (e.g., roommates, common areas, shared equipment) simultaneously affect MDRO
transmission in NHs across a region using the various NH ABMs. Specific Aim 3 will estimate how various
pathogen-specific and non-specific multi-modal strategies may affect the transmission and spread of different
MDROs individually and simultaneously in NHs across a region using the NH ABMs."
10827405,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disorder that arises following the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing
pancreatic β-cells. Previous studies, including nearly 120 peer reviewed-articles supported by this P01 over the
current grant cycle, have demonstrated that individuals with or at increased-risk for T1D display a series of innate
and adaptive immunological abnormalities linked to genetypes at >150 risk-associated loci. Indeed, these efforts
have identified a series of immune dysfunctions associated with T1D that are strongly influenced by genetics
(e.g., loss/gain of function mutations, promoter/enhancer variants, shifts in exon usage) and appear to drive
autoimunity. Yet the complex contributions of T1D-risk loci to these processes remain quite unclear. Thus, our
goal in seeking renewal of this P01 is to elucidate the mechanisms by which T1D-associated variants across the
genome (Project 1), and specifically (SH2B3 [Project 2], HLA-II region, SIRPG, CD226 [Project 3]), impart
phenotypic and functional immune defects. The research proposed will collectively test two overall hypotheses—
1) the impact of T1D-risk variants will vary by tissue, cell subset and activation state, and 2) risk variants, cellular
stress, and defects in immunologic pathways are key to engender the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic -
cells that results in T1D. The three separate but highly interactive Projects have a strong history of sharing data,
using innovative technologies, and assessing fresh and cryopreserved samples from well characterized human
subjects with or at risk for T1D, as ascertained through two Core facilities: Core A– Administrative/Sample
Acquisition and Core B– Biobank/Biostatistics/Bioinformatics. Project 1 will implement our novel pancreas slice
culture system and TCR-redirected “avatars” to evaluate the impact of inflammation in the target organ. Project
2 will use genotype selected UFDI Study Bank samples (Core B), pancreas tissues, and differentiated gene-
edited iPSCs to interrogate how SH2B3 allotypes impact innate immune cell function, T cell activation, and
trafficking through inflamed vasculature. Project 3 proposes to study pancreatic lymph node (pLN), spleen, and
peripheral blood to test the hypothesis that T1D-associated genetic risk variants alter the TCR repertoire and
gene expression pathways in a cell- and tissue-restricted manner. These proposed studies are further supported
by the rich environment for T1D research at the University of Florida that includes resources such as pancreatic
and lymphoid tissue samples from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD), interactions
with major clinical trial networks including T1D TrialNet, and special efforts related to the impact of race/genetic
ancestry (made possible through highly active recruiting efforts) on T1D heterogeneity. The successes expected
from the proposed studies should provide: 1) novel insights into the immune and genetic influences that
contribute to T1D; 2) novel biomarkers for disease susceptibility and autoimmune activity associated with the
disease; and 3) could dramatically improve prospects for the development of an effective therapeutic capable of
preventing and/or reversing T1D."
10827406,"Based on our near 25 years of experience with this P01, we believe the notion of “success” for the program is
dependent on the existence of an effective Administrative Core as a central element of fiscal/regulatory
coordination, human subject recruitment, and scientific guidance/external evaluation. With this belief, the five
goals of Core A are as follows: 1) Manage the budgetary and fiscal aspects of this program. The proposed
program involves direct cost disbursements to investigators of Projects 1, 2 & 3 as well as Cores A & B; hence,
careful oversight represents an absolute administrative requirement. 2) Coordinate ongoing feedback with regard
to the goals and activities of the P01, and facilitate communication among investigators within the program. This
aim takes a pragmatic form through implementation of a variety of functions ranging from organizing regularly
scheduled meetings to training of Project investigators by the program's Cores. Core A also provides
mechanisms for program optimization through meetings of the Internal Program Executive Committee as well
as through input provided by the External Advisory Board —for the purposes of maximizing progress and synergy
within the program. 3) Organize the collection of human materials through consenting of participants and blood
sample collection, assuring compliance with appropriate regulatory bodies and edicts. Our P01 places
substantial emphasis on diversity in both the research team and the subjects we study. Our partnerships with
units external to UF enable discretion in recruitment of participants with balance for age, sex and diversity in
terms of genetic ancestry composition. Through collection of these metadata, data generated by the three
Projects and Core B will be robust, generalizable and reflective of population heterogeneity, contributing toward
mitigation of disparities. 4) Provide database support for storage of regulatory documents as well as
data/metadata in order to facilitate investigator access to appropriate sample sets. We propose upgrades to our
existing “Diabase” in order to improve the investigator interface for sample selection (e.g., based on subject
genotype at specific loci, polygenic risk score, age, disease status, sex) as well as FAIR Principles-compliant
data management and stewardship. 5) Compile appropriate datasets and facilitate communication of program
results. Core A will communicate with NIH staff, provide assistance with publications, and presentation of
program results.The Internal Program Executive Committee has reviewed changing priorities and advances in
the field of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and with this renewal application, organized itself to address the growing needs
for: a) identifying processes at the intersection of pancreas biology and anti-β-cell immunity; b) understanding
genotype/phenotype interactions that impact immune responsiveness and trafficking; c) developing improved
biomarkers (immune, metabolic, genetic) reflective of key pathogenic processes; and d) discovering methods
that impart immune modification capable of interrupting T1D progression. We expect that Core A's commitment
to facilitating synergy and collaboration across the P01 will continue to prove beneficial for achieving these goals."

resources include aging mouse colonies of multiple strains, including those with reporters for identification of
SnCs. We also have access to a robust murine tissue bank and cataloging infrastructure for aging tissues,

transcriptomics expertise, transfer learning algorithms that can identify SnCs and elucidate cell communication
from single-cell datasets, and integration of genomics and multiple imaging modalities to identify SnCs in tissues
in 2D and 3D. For this proposal, the JMN-MSMP team will focus first on developing a timeline of the emergence
of senescence markers in plasma/serum in tissues from the National Institute of Aging murine aging program
including brain. Importantly, we have archived tissues from two genetically distinct strains of laboratory mice of
both sexes over their lifespan that will allow us to implement a rigorous and multidimensional analysis as soon
as the Program is funded. This will be followed by in depth single cell analysis of selected tissues for senescence
mapping. The JMN-MSMP will consist of three Core components: the Administrative Core (AC), Biological
Analysis Core (BAC), and Data Analysis Core (DAC). The Specific Aims of the JMN-MSMP are:
Aim 1. Overall JMN-MSMP Research Strategy: Integrate genomics and imaging strategies to build a
comprehensive Atlas of Senescence in Murine Tissues, and to define the physiological impact of senescent
cells.
Aim 2. Overall JMN-MSMP Management Strategy, Goals, and Milestones: Provide infrastructure to support an
integrated research effort toward creation of the Atlas.

Continuously funded since 1983, the Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine (CBM) Research Training Program
(HL07560) provides multidisciplinary training in cardiovascular behavioral medicine research to postdoctoral
and predoctoral trainees. The CBM Program trains clinical and translational scientists to conduct
methodologically-rigorous, field-defining, and socially-conscious research at the interface of cardiovascular
physiology, pathophysiology, and behavior to address the public health challenge of cardiovascular disease.
The CBM Program fosters proficiency in four areas: (1) Principles of health behavior and behavior change,
including an advanced theoretical and mechanistic understanding of behaviors impacting the development of
cardiovascular disease; (2) Research methods and statistics, emphasizing design and execution of rigorous,
transparent, and reproducible clinical research as well as advanced statistical techniques; (3) Cardiovascular
physiology and pathophysiology, including the physiologic mechanisms linking psychosocial and behavioral
factors to cardiovascular disease; and (4) Cardiovascular diseases and health disparities, including multilevel
and lifecourse determinants of unequal distributions of cardiovascular health across populations. By providing
training in these areas, the CBM Program aligns closely with the NHLBI programmatic emphases for training
and the NHLBI Strategic Vision for Research to fill an important niche in the NHLBI T32 portfolio. The CBM
Program supports four predoctoral and four postdoctoral trainees annually, with a training duration of 2-3 years
for each trainee. Guided by an individual development plan for each trainee, the program leverages team-
based mentoring, multidisciplinary research training, tailored didactics, and an emphasis on diversity, equity,
and inclusion to equip trainees with the skills and experience needed to attain their career goals. Program
Directors and Associate Directors are a highly experienced team with an extensive history of collaboration to
support successful, coordinated program leadership. The CBM Program also benefits from CBM faculty
members, who are a diverse and accomplished group spanning the Departments of Psychiatry, Psychology,
Medicine, Health and Physical Activity, Bioengineering, and Epidemiology. The CBM program is further
supported by a demonstrated institutional track record of multidisciplinary research and training orientated to
rigor and transparency; diverse course offerings; and excellent research and training resources at the
University of Pittsburgh. With these training goals and resources, the CBM Program is poised for continued
success in meeting NHLBI’s goal of training “a diverse scientific workforce equipped with the research skills,
knowledge, and resources to tackle future heart, lung, blood and sleep challenges.”"

Scientific training in the Physiological sciences in the U.S. has undergone a transformation largely toward
molecular mechanisms and away from whole animal integrative physiology, creating a shortage of scientists and
educators with mastery of integrative physiology. The Physiology training program at the Medical College of
Wisconsin (MCW) is an exception to this trend. Our training program offers multidisciplinary instruction and
cutting-edge integrative physiology research training emphasizing the integration of knowledge from the
molecule to cell to organ to organism. Trainees develop the critical thinking, integrative reasoning, and technical
skills participating in research focused on the prevention and control of HLBS diseases such as hypertension,
metabolic disease, epilepsy and chronic respiratory diseases. Our current proposal maintains a focus on critical
thinking, organ systems physiology and translational research training with enhancements in: 1) interdisciplinary
instruction, 2) self-directed learning, 3) the trainee candidate pool, 4) the acceleration of reaching training
milestones, 5) instruction in rigor and reproducibility in the scientific method, and 6) the recruitment of students
from populations underrepresented in science and medicine. Trainees are recruited nationally from
geographically diverse areas and selected on a competitive basis on undergraduate academic credentials,
previous research experience, and commitment to a career in research in the Physiological Sciences. Students
are full-time PhD candidates, and must successfully complete the course and research requirements, including
passing the Qualifying Exam before being considered for NIH training grant support. Selection of T32 trainees
will be based on several performance metrics in coursework and research productivity, in addition to the
alignment of their research focus in the Physiological sciences and the candidate’s potential for a successful
career in the biomedical sciences. An innovative feature of the training program is to meet the anticipated need
to train students in integrative physiology to meet the growing need for such expertise in the era of Team Science
and in the post-genomic era. Research training is under the direct supervision of highly skilled and experiences
faculty preceptors in the basic sciences (primarily Physiology) and enhanced by clinical faculty. Trainees will
undergo continuous evaluation of progress by Individual Development Plans that facilitate career development
and progress toward individualized trainee goals. The success of our program in training is evidenced by a high
completion rate and publication record of the twelve T32 supported graduates in the past 10 years, who had 25
first-authored and 42 co-authored publications (~5.6/trainee). The high number of co-authored publications
reflects the highly collaborative environment among our faculty and Team Science approach. Each of these
trainees has gone on to academic research, teaching or patient care positions indicative of the success of our
approach to ensuring the future of integrative physiology into the future. Based on the long-term success of our
training program, we hereby request funds to support 8 predoctoral students in each of the next 5 years."
10791745,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Imagine Times Square in New York City: tall buildings, flashing lights, a swarm of
people. This visual scene represents a potential overload of sensory information. To guide behavior, the brain
uses a collection of filtering mechanisms that either boosts the processing of behaviorally relevant information
or suppresses the processing of distracting information. Impairments in this selective processing of sensory
information can have critical consequences for human health. Such consequences are apparent, for example,
in visuo-hemineglect associated with stroke, and in some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present proposal specifically
focuses on the selective processing of locations in visual space, referred to as spatial attention. A large-scale
network of brain regions directs spatial attention, but the specific contributions of each network node to
attention-related enhancement and suppression remain largely unknown. Here, we will test whether distinct
circuits within the attention network are driving these complementary processes in a well-characterized region
of visual cortex, i.e., visual area 4 (i.e., V4). We will specifically investigate functional contributions from two
cortical nodes of the attention network in macaques: the frontal eye fields (FEF) in frontal cortex and the lateral
intraparietal area (LIP) in parietal cortex. FEF and LIP both contribute to top-down attentional control, based on
behavioral goals. To determine whether there are distinct or redundant neural circuits underlying the effects of
attention-related enhancement and suppression on visual processing, we will record layer-specific neural
activity from V4, while simultaneously using optogenetics (i.e., the use of genetically coded, light-driven ion
channels or pumps) to inactivate known corticocortical pathways, either from FEF to V4 or from LIP to V4. The
use of optogenetics, in comparison to other causal manipulations (e.g., electrical microstimulation or
pharmacological inactivations), will allow us (i) to isolate contributions from specific between-region,
corticocortical pathways and (ii) to compare the effects of inactivating these pathways, from either FEF or LIP,
on different trials within the same experimental session. The present proposal has three specific aims: (i) to
establish the retrograde-only expression of virus in FEF and LIP after optogenetic injections in V4, (ii) to test
whether corticocortical pathways from FEF and LIP make distinct contributions to attention-related neural
effects in V4, and (iii) to test whether the complementary processes of attention-related enhancement and
suppression interact in V4. We will test the Central Hypothesis that FEF primarily contributes to the goal-
directed enhancement of behaviorally relevant information in V4 through connectivity in supragranular layers,
while (ii) LIP primarily contributes to the goal-directed suppression of distracting information in V4 through
connectivity in infragranular layers. The present proposal will advance our overarching objective of
understanding how the attention network shapes visual processing of our complex and dynamic environment."

Implementation science (ImS) is a branch of research that focuses on the improving the uptake of evidence-
based health interventions into real world settings. ImS holds promise for generating new knowledge to close
the gap between what we know can optimize health and healthcare and what happens in everyday practice,
which may be of particular importance for addressing health inequities that often result because of failure to
deliver evidence-based practice to all populations. The goal of the Partnerships for Research in Implementation
Science for Equity in Heart and Lung (PRISE-HL) diseases T32 program is to provide support to outstanding
scientists equipped to build on their scholarship with interdisciplinary training in implementation science and
health equity approaches to help transform the uptake and delivery of evidence-based interventions for heart
and lung diseases in real-world settings. UCSF is one of the world’s leading health sciences campuses and this
program will build on existing strengths in heart and lung diseases research as well as infrastructure established
through the recently launched UCSF PRISE Center, an innovative research center bringing together ImS
researchers with front-line implementers in local health systems and public health departments. A physician-
scientist and public health trained epidemiologist, both with extensive experience in applying implementation
science to health equity and who are leaders in ImS training, will direct the program. An exceptionally
accomplished group of faculty with strong records of interdisciplinary collaboration will bring complementary
expertise in clinical and translational research related to heart and lung diseases and key health equity and/or
implementation science-relevant disciplines, including behavior change, community engagement, health
economics, health policy, big data, and sociology. In addition, the program includes strong partnerships with
community and tertiary care clinical sites that serve the diverse communities of the San Francisco Bay Area and
with local (San Francisco) and regional (California) Departments of Public Health. An Advisory Committee will
work with the program directors to select T32 trainees, monitor trainees’ progress, and identify opportunities for
improving the program. The trainee recruitment process will benefit from access to a large and diverse pool of
internal candidates from UCSF’s well-established training programs and provide additional opportunities for us
to continue to recruit the most promising external trainees. Each trainee will work with mentors on their career
development committee to establish goals and tailor didactic and hands-on training experiences to develop
competencies in core areas of implementation science and health equity research. Trainees will also benefit from
embedded healthcare delivery system or public health program rotations to develop experience with real-world
practice change and a new PRISE-HL T32 Program Seminar that will integrate training in implementation science
and health equity research."

The overarching goal of my research program is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the variability in
drug metabolism to make drug therapies more effective and less toxic. The cytochrome P450 drug-
metabolizing enzymes (dmCYPs) are the main enzymes that metabolize nearly 70% of the drugs currently
used, which are highly variable from person to person, necessitating personalized drug therapy. Genetic
factors significantly affect the drug metabolism, and the variants of some dmCYPs are used as clinical
biomarkers to predict the metabolizer status. However, the underlying principles of their variable
expression/activity are far from clear. Variants that result in altered amino acid sequences have been studied
extensively, but they fail to account for all the differences observed. On the other hand, technical challenges
have thus far limited the studies on factors that affect mRNA and protein expression of dmCYPs. Most
dmCYPs are multi-gene clusters with complex genomic architecture and diverse genetic variations. With
the support of NIGMS funding, we have adopted innovative methodologies and dissected the complex
genomic architecture of multiple gene clusters (e. g., CYP3A) and identified hidden cis-acting regulatory
variants that affect gene expression (e. g., 3A4, 3A5 and 3A43). Our results demonstrate that a single variant
can have opposing effects on two genes in the same locus (e. g, 3A4, and 3A43), while more than one variant
can regulate a single gene in the same or opposite direction (e. g., CYP7A1 and CYP2D6) indicating
complex domain-domain interactions within the gene cluster and epistasis between variants. Such
complexity usually escapes genome wide association study based discovery and warrants a dedicated
approach proposed here. With the success of dissecting the CYP3A cluster, we now plan to expand and
analyze the other dmCYP gene clusters over the next five years. Furthermore, we have recently identified
ligand-free estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) as a master regulator of CYP3A4 and many other dmCYP genes.
Genetic, epigenetic, and non-genetic factors that affect ESR1-centered regulatory network will likely affect
dmCYP gene expression and enzyme activity via trans-acting mechanisms. We plan to use ESR1-knockout
hepatocytes differentiated from iPSC to characterize ESR1-centered regulatory network and to identify factors
regulating ESR1 and dmCYPs expression. The identified functional cis and trans-acting genetic variants and
epigenetic factors, including non-coding RNAs, will be tested in human liver samples for their impact on
mRNA and protein expression of dmCYPs. The clinical significance of the identified variants will be tested
in clinical cohort via collaboration. With my track record of pharmacogenetics biomarker discovery, insights
gained from studying complex multi-gene clusters, availability of novel technologies, and support from
collaborators with expertise in bioinformatics, proteomics and pharmacogenetics implementation, I am well
positioned to undertake the proposed studies. The outcome will have immediate clinical translation leading to
more accurate biomarkers for guiding personalized drug therapy."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major global health threat.
Challenges of compliance and toxicities of prolonged antimicrobial regimens and increasing drug resistance
highlight the need for novel treatment approaches. Host-directed therapy (HDT) harnesses host-intrinsic
mechanisms using small molecule drugs to accelerate sterilization and limit lung damage caused by host
immunity. We reported that metformin reduced lung bacterial load and immune pathology in Mtb-infected
mice. Retrospective data from over half a million individuals treated for diabetes with metformin support the
HDT potential of this drug. These studies reported lower rates of Mtb infection and progression from latent to
active TB, less cavitation and all-cause mortality, accelerated sputum conversion and less TB recurrence.
The goal of this project is to discern the mechanisms of metformin HDT efficacy, focusing on inflammation
and fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that metformin expands non-classical Ly6Clo monocytes in an
AMPK-dependent manner. These cells are essential for host protection in innate “trained” immunity and they
participate in tissue repair. Ly6Clo monocytes produce CXCL10 that recruits CD8+CXCR3+ memory (TM) cells,
which may restrict Mtb replication in an antigen-specific and non-specific manner. Our data also suggest that
metformin-mediated protection involves NOTCH pathway modulation, with suppression of NOTCH1 that
drives fibrosis and enhancement of NOTCH2 to regulates Ly6Clo monocyte and CD8+ TM cell differentiation.
Experiments in Aim 1 will establish the requirement for AMPK and NOTCH signaling in the protective
functions of metformin using the mouse aerosol TB model. Outcomes are lung bacterial load, immune
pathology, lung tissue damage with collagen remodeling and transcriptomic and proteomic markers of
fibrogenesis. Immunometabolic and epigenetic regulatory activities of metformin will be investigated in the
context of TB-HDT. Experiments in Aim 2 will establish the requirements for CD8+ TM cells and the CXCL10-
CXCR3 axis in host protection and evaluate potential similarities and differences between metformin-
educated CD8+ TM cells and virtual memory T cells. Both Aims include validation studies using alternative
mouse models (C3HeB/FeJ and Collaborative Cross) and de-identified human plasma, blood RNA and
PBMC samples from clinical TB studies having participants with or without metformin exposure. This project
will produce new knowledge about the mechanisms of metformin TB-HDT efficacy that will support the design
and interpretation of human clinical trials using metformin and might identify new targets for HDT agents
having greater specificity, efficacy and tolerability than metformin."
10808859,"SUMMARY
Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a condition caused by the excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone
(PTH) that can lead to aggressive bone loss, osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures. Intriguingly, PHPT is
a heterogeneous disease where some patients go on to develop bone loss while others do not, and few
biomarkers are available to predict the course of the disease. We recently reported in Nat. Comm. that the
intestinal microbiome is a potent factor governing the capacity of PTH to induce bone loss. Specifically, we
showed in mice that elevated levels of PTH in combination with microbial-released products potentiates the
activation of pro-inflammatory TNF producing T cells in gut tissue, which then migrate from the gut to the bone
marrow (BM). In a process that only occur if specific species of bacteria are present in the microbiome,
intestinal TNF producing T cells induce the expansion of Th17 cells in the gut. Elevated TNF in the BM induce
the expression of chemokine ligands that attract Th17 cells to the BM. Once in the BM, Th17 cells release the
osteoclastogenic factor IL-17 which causes RANKL-mediated bone loss. In human populations, there is
significant heterogeneity in gut microbiome diversity, including considerable variation in the frequency of
presence of specific bacteria that activate Th17 cell maturation. We hypothesize that this heterogeneity directly
accounts for the heterogeneous nature of PHPT-associated bone loss within populations, where only patients
that are colonized with Th17 cell-inducing bacteria experience PHPT-induced bone loss. In support of this
hypothesis, we show compelling new data that the relative frequency of a specific strain of the Th17 cell-
inducing bacteria Bifidobacterium longum correlates inversely with bone density in PHPT patients. In Aim 1, we
will test if the propensity of human patients with PHPT to develop bone loss can be predicted by the
composition of the gut microbiome. Furthermore, to demonstrate causality, we will colonize germ-free mice
with either the microbiome of PHTP patients, or Bifidobacterium longum and determine if the PHPT-induced,
and gut bacterial-dependent bone loss phenotype is transferable within the microbiome. These studies will
demonstrate that stool microbiome sequencing may be used as a novel screen to predict which PHPT patients
develop bone loss. In addition, identification of the bacteria that endow PTH with the capacity to induce bone
loss will provide a rationale for future studies where targeted antimicrobial approaches aimed at eradicating
Th17 cell-inducing bacteria may be used to prevent bone loss in PHPT patients. In Aim 2, we will use a
powerful new photosensitive murine model where we can visualize the trafficking cells, to measure the effects
of PTH on the migration of TNF producing T cells, and Th17 cells from the gut to the BM. The identification of
the mechanisms of human microbiome-induced T cells migration from the gut to the BM will yield essential
data to inform novel strategies for preventing skeletal complications associated with PHPT, based on the use
of FDA approved agents that block the egress of T cells from the gut and/or their influx into the BM."

 Vascular cell heterogeneity is a fascinating but poorly understood phenomenon. Numerous vascular cell
types undergo fate transitions under pathological conditions. This includes endothelial cells (ECs) undergoing
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and acquiring certain characteristics typical of macrophages
and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs, in turn, can also acquire macrophage-like features while bone
marrow-derived mononuclear cells can express certain EC and SMC markers when present at sites of chronic
inflammation. These cells fate transitions have been linked to various pathologies including atherosclerosis,
aneurysms, pulmonary hypertension and cavernous cerebral malformations. While the existence of these cell
fate transitions is now well accepted, little is known about the origin and characteristics of SMCs undergoing
these fate changes. Our preliminary data suggest that certain subpopulations of normal SMCs are particularly
prone to phenotypic modulation and are predominately pathogenic. We hypothesize that a small subpopulation
of normal SMCs is responsible for pathogenesis of CV diseases associated with expansion of the SMC pool
and that targeting these cells might prove to be a better and more specific therapeutic approach. It is our goal
in this application to define these cell populations, determine what drives their pathogenic responses and begin
identifying therapeutic approaches to controlling CV illnesses driven by specifically targeting these SMC
subsets."

 This project seeks to shed light on mechanisms underlying transdiagnostic risk for mental illness by
integrating two traditionally disparate lines of research. One line of work indicates that repetitive negative
thinking (RNT)—a transdiagnostic risk factor characterized by frequent, negative, self-focused thoughts—
increases vulnerability for a range of mental health disorders, including depression and anxiety. A second line
of work demonstrates that high-quality social relationships are associated with lower rates of mental and
physical illness; conversely, relationship stress, hostility, and disconnection exacerbate loneliness, isolation,
and mental and physical illness. This proposal will test a new model in which RNT and social connectedness
work together as parts of an integrated whole. The central argument of this model is that RNT exerts its
pernicious effects on mental health by impairing the ability to meaningfully connect with others through
empathy—a critical component of social connection that involves sharing and understanding others’ emotions.
Critical to this model is the hypothesis that RNT and empathy operate dyadically; that is, they affect both
partners in a close relationship. To test this model, this project will implement a multilevel research design that
integrates self-report, neuroimaging, and naturalistic observation to study RNT, social connection, and mental
health in the context of established close relationships. Specifically, the project will employ a multi-method
approach across 200 established romantic couples (young adults to those in middle age; N = 400) to assess
the following aims: (1) Examine associations between RNT and partner-directed neural and behavioral
empathy among romantic couples; (2) Determine the role of neural empathy in dyadic social-emotional and
mental health outcomes; (3) Determine the role of RNT in dyadic mental health outcomes; and (4) Examine
whether neural empathy mediates the dyadic association between RNT and longitudinal mental health
outcomes. Advancing prior work, the proposed research will examine neural empathy in a novel and validated
social feedback task using functional MRI in each member of the couple, to be modelled using dyadic
statistics. Additionally, RNT and daily social behaviors will be assessed in everyday life using two mobile apps
developed by the research team: Mind Window and the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR). Finally,
mental health will be assessed over 6 months to allow for prospective changes in the primary outcomes of
interest. To tackle the study’s aims, this proposal brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers with
expertise spanning all facets of the proposed research: RNT, depression, neural empathy, social
connectedness, dyadic modelling, and ambulatory assessment. Ultimately, this work holds promise for
advancing scientific understanding of how individual and social risks for psychopathology operate together to
shape emotional disorders. In turn, this research has the potential to help identify novel intervention targets to
strengthen social connectedness in service of improving mental health."

Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a
thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro
model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm)
are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human
embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern
resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive
streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all
mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same
time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately
become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which
population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and
how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to
understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm
during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation
decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning
known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will
develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses”
between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human
embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular
and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work
includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as
well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem
cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The
proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full
single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions
about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future
cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a
strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies,
and causal inference."

rigorous research training for graduate students enrolled in the UAB Graduate Biomedical Sciences (GBS; 
PhD candidates) and postdoctoral fellows (MD, PhD, or combined MD, PhD). The multidisciplinary nature of 
the proposed training is fostered by the diversity of 24 faculty mentors who hold primary appointments in the 
Schools of Medicine, Engineering, Public Health and the College of Arts and Sciences, and are members of 
UAB University-Wide Interdisciplinary Research Centers (UWIRCs). In concert with the Research Projects, the 
training core will support both graduate students and postdoctoral trainees (~2:1 ratio over the duration of the 
RETCC) in each year of this program. We propose an incremental increase in trainee slots: 3, 4, 5, 6, and 6 in 
years 1 through 5, respectively. The faculty mentors have been grouped into four thematic areas based on 
scientific expertise: (1) environmental health and lung disease; (2) environmental science and engineering; (3) 
minority health and health disparities; and (4) social sciences and study design. Multi- and transdisciplinary 
structure of the training will be facilitated by co-mentoring of all trainees by faculty selected from different 
thematic groups. The UAB-RETCC will allow students/trainees rigorous education and training in lung cellular 
and molecular biology, physiology, and disease pathogenesis with an emphasis on chronic obstructive lung 
disease (COPD), asthma, and pulmonary infections. Environmental and engineering research experiences will 
provide trainees with skills and expertise in toxicology, gas/metal sensing technology, mass spectrometry, and 
remediation/mitigation. In addition to the research projects that will be conducted in the mentors’ laboratories, 
training will encompass a highly structured didactic program that includes (1) a “survival skills” curriculum in 
collaboration with the UAB Office of Postdoctoral Education and the Center for Clinical and Translational 
Science, (2) a research core curriculum in collaboration with the Deep South Occupational Safety and Health 
Education and Research Center, (3) training in minority health/disparities concerns in collaboration with the 
Comprehensive Minority and Health Disparities Research Center and (4) study design in collaboration with 
epidemiologists and environmental health scientists at the UAB School of Public Health. Strong emphasis will 
be placed on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities. Formal instruction will include study 
design including environmental health sciences courses at the School of Public Health. By completion of the

 Environmental exposure of the lung to airborne particulate matter (PM) containing mixed heavy metals 
contributes to development of chronic lung diseases, including asthma. These diseases are classically 
associated with dysregulated epithelial-mesenchymal communication. PM with a particulate size of ≤2.5 µm 
(PM2.5) contain high levels of heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and manganese (Mn). 
However, the mechanisms of how these heavy metals contribute to disease pathogenesis are unknown. In 
support of this project, we detected elevated levels of heavy metals in the serum/urine of residents from the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated National Priorities List (NPL) Superfund site in North 
Birmingham. Asthmatic children from this Affected Area have evidence of systemic heavy metals exposure, as 
evidenced by higher urinary levels of arsenic. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained by bronchoscopy of 
asthmatic individuals from this Affected Area contain epithelial cell-derived exosomes that package 
mitochondria. Additionally, BAL-derived exosomes from human asthmatic subjects are skewed towards a 
higher concentration of anti-apoptotic sphingolipids (sphingosine-1-phoshate > ceramide) by SWATH- 
lipidomics analysis. These exosomes are fibrogenic as they induce reprogramming of fibroblasts to an 
apoptosis-resistant and fibrogenic phenotype. Animal studies demonstrate that intra-tracheal instillation of 
heavy metals induces peribronchial fibrosis in mice, providing an opportunity to generate proof-of-concept pre- 
clinical data in support of targeting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic sphingolipid pathways in environmental 
asthma. 
 The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that heavy metal exposures in children induce airway 
epithelium injury/activation that triggers the release of exosomal lipids to activate fibroblasts/smooth muscle 
cells that contribute to airway hyper-responsiveness and remodeling in asthma. The specific aims are to: (1) 
determine the mechanisms of heavy metal-induced exosomal lipid signaling that activates sub-epithelial 
mesenchymal cells (SMCs/Fbs); (2) determine the role of lipid mediators/exosomes released by bronchial 
epithelial cells in airway hyper-responsiveness and remodeling in mice exposed to heavy metals; and (3) 
determine whether heavy metal exposures are associated with asthma severity and increased levels of 
plasma, EBC and sputum lipid biomarkers in children residing in the North Birmingham NPL Superfund site. 
 These studies will provide new insights into the impact of heavy metal exposure on asthma susceptibility 
and severity; on novel mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal communication by fibrogenic exosomes; and 
development of new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of chronic asthma associated with heavy metal 
exposures."
10738815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Visceral leishmaniasis is a devastating, neglected tropical disease, ultimately leading to multiorgan failure and
death when left untreated. As with many parasitic infections, efforts to develop an effective vaccine have
remained unsuccessful. In contrast to a number of infectious pathogens which can be controlled by neutralizing
antibodies and/or cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, protection against leishmaniasis is largely mediated by T helper 1
differentiated CD4+ T cells, but how CD4+ T cell activation, differentiation, and function are regulated during
visceral leishmaniasis is still largely unknown. A major limitation to these studies has been the inability to
accurately identify Leishmania-specific CD4+ T cells in experimental model systems in order to assess T cell
longevity and functions during and after the course of the infection. Here, using a recently identified MHC-II
epitope conserved across Leishmania species, we show that in contrast to cutaneous versions of leishmaniasis,
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells become functionally exhausted during visceral leishmaniasis, produce IL-10, and
express high levels of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4. This suggests that rather than remaining
“hidden”, high parasite burden and/or antigen load overwhelms the adaptive immune system to the point where
antigen-specific CD4+ T cells lose the capacity to produce the necessary pro-inflammatory cytokines to kill
parasites residing within macrophages. Because there is currently no effective vaccine and limited treatment
options for leishmaniasis, we have generated recombinant Vaccinia virus (VacV) vectors expressing the
immunodominant Leishmania epitope targeted for MHC-II presentation to study the CD4+ T cell response against
this parasitic infection. To begin to investigate the mechanisms of CD4+ T cell activation and to identify strategies
to reverse or limit T cell dysfunction during visceral leishmaniasis, we will 1) define the functions and gene
expression profiles of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that become activated following either cutaneous or visceral
Leishmania infections and 2) determine if therapeutic viral immunization combined with immunotherapy restores
function to CD4+ T cells during visceral leishmaniasis. The overall goal of this project will be to begin to define
the mechanisms that regulate CD4+ T cell function and dysfunction during visceral leishmaniasis, which will
contribute to our long-term goal of improving vaccine design and therapies against this complex parasite."

This K23 application proposed a career development plan to help Dr. Beth Fields establish an independent
research program that focuses on optimizing hospital-based care and outcomes for patients living with
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their family member or friend care partners. She will
train under the mentorship of a transdisciplinary group of senior scientists with research expertise in participatory
human-centered design, conduct of clinical trials, and clinical ADRD care. She will continue working with her
current mentors, Drs. Farrar-Edwards, Werner, and Shah, and Mr. Hetzel, all of whom have experience
mentoring trainees. This will be complemented by content and mentoring expertise from Drs. Schulz and
Gilmore-Bykovskyi. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow Dr.
Fields to fill critical gaps in her knowledge and skill set relating to the study of hospital-based care processes
and outcomes for patients living with ADRD and their care partners. Her training goals are to develop skills in (1)
participatory human-centered design principles, (2) hospital-based ADRD care delivery, (3) clinical trial design
and statistical analysis, (4) ethical and regulatory standards in ADRD research, and (5) professional skills in
team science and scientific leadership. Achieving these goals will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish
important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. To
this end, Dr. Fields’ proposed research plan builds directly on her prior work developing and validating the Care
Partner Hospital Assessment Tool (CHAT). Guided by the widely used and effective decision-support model of
Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), the CHAT applies a sequential screening and
referral pathway that 1) identifies care partners and their preferences for inclusion in the patients’ hospital care
and 2) tailors referrals to address their stated preferences and unmet needs for post-discharge preparedness.
The SBIRT model was designed to adapt flexibly to different health conditions and contexts, thus enabling the
adaptation of the CHAT to facilitate the inclusion and preparation of care partners of patients living with ADRD.
Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to adapt CHAT for care partners of hospitalized patients living with
ADRD (CHAT-AD) and evaluate its feasibility and potential efficacy in a pilot randomized clinical trial. Findings
from this study, in combination with the career development plan, will enable Dr. Fields to launch an independent
program of research that aims to (1) improve hospital-based care processes and outcomes for patients living
with ADRD and their care partners, and (2) elucidate the essential caregiving role that so many care partners of
patients living with ADRD assume."
10734777,"Aphasia is a multi-modality disturbance of language that is often acquired after a left hemisphere stroke. Post-stroke depression is two times higher in persons with aphasia (PWAs) than in the general stroke population. Post-stroke depression is associated with worse language and cognitive performance and overall decreased quality of life. However, PWAs are typically excluded from studies of post-stroke depression due to a lack of valid assessment tools. More importantly, studies of depression in PWAs only assess depression using weekly retrospective measures thus ignoring the day-to-day variability in mood. An innovative approach to assessing the dynamic nature of depression is ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMAs involve repeated sampling of data over time in the real-time in real-world environments. EMAs are brief thus minimizing response burden and are typically collected using mobile phones which are owned by more than 85% of Americans. EMAs are ecologically valid but have not been used in PWAs due to their language disturbances. A goal of this study is to use user-centered design to create and validate an aphasia-friendly EMA of depression and investigate its association with communicative confidence (N = 95). Having the confidence to communicate despite aphasia is a robust predictor of overall quality of life. Aim 1 of the study will adapt a user-centered design by involving PWAs, their caregivers, and speech-language pathologists to design and construct brief (~less than 60s) EMA measure of depression. Validity of the EMA measure will be established using a convergent validity approach and use as its validator an established depression scale for PWAs. Aim 2 will establish the validity of the EMA assessment of depression using a smartphone-based measure of physical activity (i.e., step count). Reduced physical activity is a robust correlate of depression in both neurologically healthy individuals and those with stroke. Aim 3 will investigate the relationship between depression and communicative confidence and test the incremental validity of the EMA measure over the retrospective weekly measure of depression. Usability and feasibility of the EMA will also be established. Lastly, an exploratory aim will determine the association between smartphone-based physical activity and communicative confidence. The proposed career development award aims to provide Dr. Ashaie with training activities that will increase his knowledge of (1) psychopathology especially depression, (2) user-centered design, (3) EMA methods, and (4) analyzing smartphone-based sensor data. The training goals will be accomplished through mentored training, formal coursework, and seminars and workshops. His interdisciplinary mentorship team consists of leading experts in depression and transdiagnostic research (Dr. Shankman), user-centered design (Dr. Reddy), designing depression assessments (Dr. Griffith), statistics (Dr. Siddique), and analyzing passive smartphone-based sensor data (Dr. Jayaraman). The K23 will enable Dr. Ashaie to submit an R01 and become an NIH-funded independent scientist whose work in depression assessment can lead to better depression management and ultimately improve PWA’s quality of life."

Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion of the Gram-negative soil
saprophyte and Tier 1 select agent Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bps). The overall melioidosis mortality rate
exceeds 40% in endemic areas of southeast Asia such as northeast (NE) Thailand (despite appropriate
treatment), and modeling indicates that 165,000 cases of human melioidosis occur annually worldwide. For
decades, diagnosis of melioidosis has required culture of Bps from a clinical specimen. This may take several
days, delaying appropriate treatment, and in many resource-limited settings the necessary microbiology
facilities for bacterial culture and identification are not available. Few suitable non-culture-based diagnostics
exist. Performing a case-control analysis nested within a prospective, single-center cohort study of patients
hospitalized with infection (Ubon-Sepsis study), we have developed a five-metabolite signature in plasma that,
in preliminary studies, has extremely high accuracy differentiating melioidosis from other causes of infection
(misclassification error rate=2.0%, AUC=0.99). These results suggest that measuring a limited number of
circulating metabolites during initial presentation has significant diagnostic potential for melioidosis. We
hypothesize that this host metabolomic signature is a novel and accurate diagnostic tool in identifying patients
with melioidosis. To test this potentially high impact hypothesis, we will leverage our singular expertise in
melioidosis diagnostics and human immunology, and an unparalleled multi-center melioidosis research
infrastructure in NE Thailand in the following specific aims: 1) Replicate the diagnostic accuracy of the five-
metabolite melioidosis signature in plasma for the detection of melioidosis in additional cases in the Ubon-
Sepsis study. 2) Validate the diagnostic accuracy of the five-metabolite melioidosis signature in plasma for the
detection of melioidosis in an independent prospective multi-center study. 3) Use an unbiased approach to
identify additional signatures of melioidosis in plasma. If our hypothesis is proven, the use of blood metabolites
as a melioidosis diagnostic could greatly enhance our present approaches to identifying melioidosis.
Subsequent development of this tool for clinical use could have a profoundly beneficial impact on the burden of
this often-lethal infectious disease."

 T cells responding to cancer develop a hyporesponsive phenotype, characterized by high levels of inhibitory
receptor expression, low cytokine production, and a failure to control tumor growth. We have previously identified
a transcriptional program induced by persistent antigen stimulation that was shared by mouse and human T cells
responding to chronic viral infections and tumors. We linked this program to activation of the Nuclear Receptor
Subfamily 4 Group A (NR4A) transcription factors (TFs), which are potently induced during chronic stimulation.
We also identified NR4A-sensitive regulatory elements that became accessible in T cells responding to chronic
viral infection and tumors. We found that NR4A TFs concomitantly promoted inhibitory receptor expression and
limited cytokine production, leading to an exhausted T cell state that reduced chimeric antigen receptor
expressing T (CAR-T) cell activity against solid tumors. CAR-T cells engineered to lack all three NR4A TFs
differentiated to a unique population with potent anti-tumor activity compared to wild-type T cells. We connected
this improved function to increased expression and activity of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TFs in NR4A-deficient
T cells than in wild-type. In new preliminary studies, we found that CAR-T cells with a partial loss of NR4A TFs
also provided better protection than wild-type CAR-T cells, but had a unique “exhaustion resistant” phenotype
that are poised for effector function and have increased potential for long term survival. In this application, we
will test the hypothesis that NR4A and bZIP TFs can be “tuned” to control the transcriptional programs and
function of “exhaustion resistant” CAR-T cells in tumors. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of therapeutic
interventions, using antibodies or small molecules, on the function and survival of “exhaustion resistant” CAR-T
cells. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of NR4A regulated bZIP TFs to the function of NR4A-deficient
CAR-T cells and their effects on transcriptional programs in “exhaustion resistant” CAR-T cells. In Aim 3, we will
define the effects of NR4A TFs on bZIP TF activity at regulatory elements and identify chromatin associated co-
factors that may be targeted to control the function of “exhaustion resistant” CAR-T cells. The expected outcome
of our proposed studies is a comprehensive understanding of the effects of NR4A and bZIP TFs on CAR-T cells
in tumors, through which we will identify practical strategies to “tune” the function of CAR-T cells for therapeutic
benefit by controlling transcriptional programs."
10798103,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Anxiety disorders are impairing and amongst the most common psychiatric conditions; yet, many
impacted individuals do not receive or respond to evidence-based care. There is thus a great need to develop
and optimize additional first-line, more accessible interventions for anxiety disorders. Exercise has benefits for
anxiety and physical health, without many of the side effects, accessibility issues, or costs of medications or
psychotherapy. However, adherence to exercise recommendations is low, and even worse for high intensity
exercise (HIE) in individuals with anxiety disorders. This may be due to high anxiety sensitivity (AS), or fear of
anxiety-related physiological sensations, as HIE may induce similar sensations. There are, however, no formal
guidelines for optimal intensity or titration of exercise for any mental health condition, and it remains unclear
whether exercise requires slower titration for optimal tolerability and response for anxiety.
 In order to develop exercise as a formally prescribed intervention for anxiety disorders in a way that
enhances engagement and adherence, research is needed to guide optimal titration of exercise prescriptions,
and to establish mechanisms that should be targeted to optimize outcomes in practice. Addressing these gaps,
this study will examine the impact of exercise titration on AS/anxiety symptom severity as well as engagement
and adherence. Specifically, 90 sedentary adults with a primary anxiety disorder and moderate to high AS will
be randomized to either 8 weeks of 1) low intensity exercise, or 2) flexible titration to HIE. Blinded, validated
clinician-rated and patient-rated outcomes will be assessed over treatment and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. To
better understand what mechanisms influence decisions to exercise in the real-world, and novel to this
research and key training goals, are the use of heart rate (HR) as an objective mechanistic target for exercise
intensity, examining changes in valuation of exercise through a neuroeconomics task, and the integration of
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure effects of immediate changes in mood with exercise on
anxiety outcomes and adherence. Additional training goals will support the analysis of study data with state-of-
the-art advanced statistical techniques such as growth curve modelling and machine learning.
 The scientific aims of this study map onto my training plan in three primary areas: 1) applying an NIMH
experimental therapeutics approach, integrating an objective target mechanism (HR) and transdiagnostic AS,
2) examining EMA data with HR to identify real time drivers of engagement and response outside the office
setting, and 3) applying advanced computational psychiatry techniques to data analysis. Related training goals
will enable integration of neuroeconomic human decision-making models into the current study and integral
training in neural mechanisms of action to support future R-level proposals. Finally, mentorship from Drs.
Simon (primary mentor), Abrantes (Co-mentor), and Glimcher, Jay, Laska, and Pine (advisors) will propel me
toward an independent research career focused on optimizing exercise interventions for mental health."

The respiratory system is comprised of multiple unique and spatially distinct compartments that respond to
injury and diseases states differently based on their cellular and extracellular composition. The alveolar
compartment or niche is responsible for the majority of gas exchange with the external environment in the
lungs and is an area that is dramatically altered during lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Within the alveolus, there are at least two major
mature epithelial cell types, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), as well as various
mesenchymal cells including Pdgfra+/Axin2+ mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), Axin2+
myofibroblast precursor cells (AMPs), and poorly defined vascular endothelial cell populations. Despite our
increasing knowledge of the cell types that comprise the lung alveolus, we have little information on how they
communicate with each other or how their progenitor-differentiated progeny relationships are ultimately
regulated. To address these questions, we propose to characterize the genetic pathways of the mature adult
lung to better understand the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underlying lung homeostasis and
regeneration. Our preliminary data has identified two new and important transcriptional regulators of alveolar
epithelial homeostasis and regeneration: Tfcp2l1 and Klf5. Our preliminary data suggest that Tfcp2l1 and Klf5
regulate the self-renewal of AEP and AT2 cells and their differentiation into AT1 cells, in opposing manners.
Tfcp2l1 is essential in restricting AT2 differentiation into the AT1 lineage whereas Klf5 is essential for licensing
the ability of AT2 cells to differentiate into AT1 cells after acute injury. Moreover, our preliminary data suggests
that Tfcp2l1 marks the AEP sublineage in a manner similar to how Lgr5 marks the intestinal stem cell.
Together, these data provide critical insight into the molecular and cellular orchestration of alveolar
homeostasis and regeneration through the engagement of cell type specific transcriptional pathways that
regulate self-renewal and differentiation of epithelial cell lineages."
10763783,"ABSTRACT
Shigella spp. are a major global cause of diarrhea and dysentery. Children 2-5 years of age in low- and middle-
income countries are the most affected. Mortality is second only to rotavirus among diarrheal diseases in young
children, and repeated bouts of disease cause lifelong disability. In industrialized nations, Shigella outbreaks
have occurred in day care centers and medical institutions. Shigella spp. rapidly acquire genetic elements that
confer antimicrobial resistance. A safe, effective, and affordable vaccine could make a major public health
impact, yet none is currently approved. Candidates based on the Shigella-O-antigen are in clinical development.
However, that approach is impractical and costly, requiring multiple vaccines to prevent disease caused by
Shigella strains with different O antigens. This proposal seeks to develop a safe, practical, and effective broad-
spectrum Shigella vaccine based on highly conserved Shigella Type III secretion system (TTSS) proteins,
invasion plasmid antigen (Ipa) B, IpaH, and the virulence antigen VirG (IcsA). Our laboratory was the first to
report the high immunogenic and broad protective capacity of Shigella IpaB in mice, and the association of IpaB-
and VirG- serum IgG (IgG1) levels with clinical protection against shigellosis in humans. Preliminary data in this
application demonstrate that VirG also elicits potent and protective immunity. In addition, we have found that
adults living in endemic regions who acquire natural immunity to Shigella have high levels of IpaB-, VirG-, and
IpaH- serum antibodies. Maternal IgG against these proteins are more efficiently transferred to infants through
the placenta as compared to IgG against the O-polysaccharide. High levels of antibodies are also present in
breast milk. This robust maternally-derived immunity is consistent with the low incidence of infection at <6 months
of life. Together, our findings provide a strong premise for the success of a broad-spectrum subunit (IpaB, IpaH,
and/or VirG) Shigella vaccine. Given parenterally, this vaccine is expected to be well-tolerated and to elicit robust
immunity in young children, the main target group.
In Aim 1, we will purify and characterize Shigella IpaB, IpaH, and VirG using an innovative cell-free protein
synthesis system. This technological breakthrough allows the production of high-quality vaccine antigens at large
yield and can be easily scaled-up for manufacturing. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the capacity of IpaB, IpaH, and
VirG to elicit protective immunity and to confer broad-spectrum protection in mice and guinea pigs. The proteins
will be administered parenterally, alone or combined, with alum as adjuvant ‒ a strategy that can be readily
translated to humans. In Aim 3, we will investigate the protective role of IpaB, IpaH, and VirG antibodies through
passive transfer experiments in mouse and guinea pig infection models and specific steps of infection targeted
by each antibody using in vitro cell culture. We have unique expertise, tools, and novel technology to produce a
simple and efficacious new subunit vaccine to prevent multidrug-resistant Shigella. If successful, this concept
could be easily tested in Phase I studies in humans."
10760271,"Project Summary/Abstract
Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major nosocomial pathogen that causes severe diarrheal
disease that is highly infectious and difficult to treat. C. difficile is easily transmitted due to the formation and
expulsion of contagious spores from infected hosts. The spore form of C. difficile is resistant to most disinfectants
and is critical for the survival of the bacterium outside of the host intestine. The gastrointestinal tract is the only
natural environment known to support C. difficile spore formation, but we understand little about how spore
formation is initiated by the bacterium. The long-term goal of this project is to uncover the molecular
mechanisms that control the initiation of C. difficile sporulation. Based on our data, we hypothesize that several
early sporulation proteins function in independent pathways to regulate the initiation of sporulation by controlling
activation of the master transcriptional regulator, Spo0A. The specific objectives of this application are to define
the direct regulatory mechanisms that act upon Spo0A and to delineate the molecular pathways that control
sporulation initiation. Capitalizing on our previous experiences in C. difficile molecular genetics, gene regulation,
and Gram-positive intestinal pathogenesis, we will meet the objectives through the experiments detailed in two
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will extend our current studies to uncover direct interacting partners of Spo0A using
a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. In parallel, Aim 2 expands epistatic analyses to construct
Spo0A regulatory pathways, followed by functional analyses of the proteins within the initiation cascade. This
research is innovative because it combines biomolecular and genetic approaches to resolve a fundamental
question about this important and complex biological process. Completion of these aims is expected to expose
potential vulnerabilities in spore initiation. This work is an essential step in the development of rational strategies
to impede C. difficile transmission by preventing the formation of infectious spores in the host."
10755271,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible
blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular
pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop
administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a
more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs.
African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians.
Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence.
Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly
affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual
circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in
predominantly Caucasian populations.
Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health
record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial
intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk
prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding
how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural
context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare
delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver
information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner.
Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring
and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this
proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor
to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio-
cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct
machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping
a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative,
comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and
slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity."
10749892,"Heart disease, cancer and diabetes are three of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States (US) and
all are diet-related diseases. Latinos are the largest immigrant population in the US but they share an uneven
burden of chronic disease including risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. Understanding the
factors related to disease risk and developing culturally-appropriate population-level interventions are critical to
reduce health disparities. Yet, such research is often stymied by the lack of measurement tools that are
specific, appropriate, and valid for diverse populations; poor measurement tools cloud our understanding of
disease-risk factors and may lead to inconclusive or wrong conclusions regarding the impact of interventions.
High-quality measurement tools are part of the essential infrastructure needed for understanding and
evaluating population health and advance the science of diet-related diseases. While myriad factors influence
diet-related chronic disease risk, food consumed at home accounts for half of all food expenditures among US
adults and represent the most proximal and modifiable factors that influence the foods and nutrients that
people consume on a daily basis. However, few valid home food environment assessment tools exist and none
have been validated with large, immigrant or low-literacy populations (i.e., limited understanding/use of the
written form of one’s native language). In 2008, our team developed and validated a Home Food Inventory
(HFI) to assess the healthfulness and obesity risk of home food environments using a checklist format. Our
user-administered HFI instrument has been used extensively in the field for NIH-funded studies by our team
and many others. Citation benchmarking statistics indicate our validation study article is in the top 2% globally
compared to similar articles. Yet, the original HFI can only be used with English-speaking populations, is quite
lengthy and paper-based. Our present objective is to further advance the science by developing an accessible
home food environment assessment toolkit that includes valid and reliable paper and multi-media electronic
tools targeting foods known to impact diet-related health that can be user-administered across literacy levels
and in English and Spanish. Our specific aims are to: 1) Reduce the original Home Food Inventory (HFI) into a
streamlined HFI-core instrument, maximizing utility and efficiency and minimizing participant burden while
retaining foods most impactful on diet-related health; 2) Evaluate the HFI-core (English and Spanish paper
versions) by assessing usability, acceptability, validity and reliability, and modify as needed; 3) Develop
electronic HFI-core tools (eHFI) that present audio and visual representation of foods for English speakers and
Spanish speakers in their native language to overcome language and literacy issues; 4) Evaluate both eHFI
tools by assessing usability, acceptability, reliability and validity, and modify as needed; and 5) Facilitate broad
use of the instruments through a permanent and easily-accessible storage platform and provide support and a
technological assistance platform for future language adaptations and testing."

SUMMARY
The HPMI Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will support the Center's mission in all stages of
research and publication, facilitating reproducible analysis, visualization, and access to center data and results.
The Core will be composed of four major components: software and analysis workflows for data integration
the Cytoscape and the Cytoscape Ecosystem; the Network Data Exchange (NDEx); and the HPMI Data and
Analysis Portal. First, we will develop workflows to integrate proteomics, transcriptomics, genetics, and
functional data generated by Projects 1 and 2 with existing -omics and GWAS datasets to select host factor
candidates for validation. Second, Cytoscape will provide a range of tools for analyzing and visualizing
molecular networks, interaction data, and hierarchical network models from both Projects. The third
component, NDEx, will provide database infrastructure to support the sharing, reviewing, and disseminating of
network data and models. It will also enable consolidated access to public biological network resources for use
by HPMI investigators. Finally, the HPMI Data and Analysis Portal will provide a common access point for
software tools and pipelines and their associated data. The above components – software and analysis
workflows for data integration, visual network maps in Cytoscape, and storage of networks and models in
NDEx – will all be made accessible through the HPMI’s website. Additionally, publications using HPMI products
will be enhanced by the recent additions to Cytoscape for dynamically embedding network data in peer-
reviewed journals. Finally, the Core will draw on an impressive array of hardware infrastructure for
supercomputing, including high performance clusters at multiple sites."
10897698,"TECHNOLOGY CORE
SUMMARY
Systematic characterization of protein and genetic interaction networks of respiratory pathogens in disease-
relevant cells and 3D culture is critical for the identification of functional host-pathogen complexes and targets
for therapeutic development. Systems biology approaches that determine protein-protein interactions
(PPIs), characterize protein and posttranslational modification (PTM) abundance changes during infection, and
classify functional host factors that regulate infectious disease pathogenesis, can provide strategic insight and
generate models of respiratory pathogen infection. Combined with visualization of key host-pathogen
complexes at atomic level through structural biology, and integrating with clinical and patient data related
to disease severity, our innovative “systems to mechanism, bedside to benchtop” approach can be
incredibly powerful for the identification of new therapeutic targets and for predicting respiratory disease
outcome. The Technology Core will provide the infrastructure and technological expertise essential to
the completion of the overall Host Pathogen Map Initiative (HPMI) 2.0 objectives. With support of Core
facilities, the Technology Core will provide a suite of state-of-the-art proteomic technologies (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Proteomics Facility for Disease Target Discovery, UCSF, Quantitative Biosciences
Institute (QBI), Gladstone Institute), genetic screens (Innovative Genomics Institute, UCBerkeley),
and structural biology approaches (UCSF Advanced Microscopy Laboratory and Crystallography
Facilities, UCSF) for the generation of high-quality data, which will be integrated in collaboration with the
Data Management and Bioinformatics and Modeling Core with clinical and patient derived data. Our
goal is to provide PPI and global proteomic analyses, genome-wide and targeted knockdown and
knockout genetic screens, and structural characterization of host-pathogen interactions for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) (Project 1), and respiratory viruses: SARS-CoV-2, IAV, IBV, RSV, and HPIV (Project 2).
We will analyze selected variants and clinical isolates for each pathogen in disease-relevant cell lines,
primary cells isolated from healthy donors or mice, 3D-culture models including human airway epithelial
organoids, and infected patient samples. Finally, we will continue to develop, optimize, and innovate new
technological advances as needed to support Project 1 and 2 and HPMI 2.0 overall goals."
10897702,"MODELING CORE
SUMMARY
To improve our understanding of infectious diseases, the Host Pathogen Map Initiative (HPMI) has launched
systematic efforts to analyze the networks of molecular interactions that interconnect pathogens and hosts. While
parts of this work is experimental, this Modeling Core presents the central computational framework.
A first computational theme concerns methods to determine human subcellular substructures and components
as well as how they are altered by interactions with pathogenic factors. Aim 1 focuses on creating 3D models of
host-pathogen protein complexes. It will apply established methods of integrative structural biology to data from
the HPMI projects, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), proteomics (PPI, PTM, and APEX) and
CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic studies. Initial efforts will focus on the Nsp2-Rap1Gds1, ORF8-IL17RA, and
ORF9B-MARK2 complexes involving SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins, as well as Pks13 from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, all identified in previous work by the HPMI. Aim 2 focuses on mapping host cell components at
scales at and above the protein complex, extending to larger compartments and organelles. It will expand on our
recent compelling proof-of-concept for creating an unbiased hierarchical map of subcellular components in
human cells. These whole-cell maps will be analyzed to reveal specific subcellular components targeted by
pathogens and/or that are under mutational selection in either pathogen or host.
A second computational theme concerns methods to integrate host-pathogen cell maps with functional analysis
and predictive medicine. Aim 3 uses the maps to build interpretable deep learning systems for prediction of
infectious disease outcomes including disease severity. This aim draws from our previous work to establish
“visible” learning models (DCell and DrugCell), which are not black boxes but have internal organization
determined by prior knowledge of biological structure. We will construct such models from HPMI cell maps,
incorporating key improvements over our first-generation pilots. Finally, Aim 4 will use visible deep learning
systems alongside other machine learning models to design and evaluate combinatorial biomarkers that govern
M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV2 infection in clinical settings.
Through these aims, we advance our basic knowledge of the macromolecular structures and functions most
crucial for infection, while embedding this knowledge within intelligent systems for precision medicine."
10766723,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) is an impairing condition manifested as extreme sensitivity to stimuli
such as loud noises or being touched. SOR is present across neurodevelopmental disorders, but is particularly
prevalent in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with rates of at least 56-70%. SOR is a fundamental
limitation to individuals’ ability to participate in the community, succeed in school, complete daily living tasks, and
interact socially. Despite this, there are almost no empirically-based treatments for SOR, in part due to the lack
of understanding of its underlying biological mechanisms. Furthermore, while SOR tends to decline across
adolescence into adulthood, there is little understanding as to why and for whom it improves. Thus, the primary
goals of this study are to identify the developmental course of SOR as well as neurobiological mechanisms
through which it can be attenuated, both essential to developing interventions. Our team has conducted some
of the first studies identifying key neural mechanisms of SOR across youth with ASD, including 1) over-reactive
brain responses/reduced habituation in primary sensory cortices and amygdala, 2) reduced thalamic GABA, and
3) reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-amygdala functional connectivity during aversive sensory stimulation. Our
prior studies also indicate that the subset of youth with ASD but low SOR show heightened amygdala-prefrontal
connectivity during sensory stimulation, suggesting a mechanism for resilience against SOR. Our preliminary
data also suggest that amygdala reactivity to aversive sensory stimulation declines with age while PFC activation
increases. This proposal seeks to build on this foundation by examining biological mechanisms through which
SOR may be attenuated either through natural development or through direct intervention, with the goal of
proximate translation to treatment. Using a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will examine:
1) developmental changes in sensory reactivity in ASD compared to typically developing (TD) children; 2)
developmental changes in two candidate neural mechanisms of sensory regulation (thalamic GABA and PFC-
amygdala connectivity), and 3) the relative ability of two different emotion regulation strategies (attention cuing
vs. reappraisal) in engaging sensory regulation. Based on our prior studies and preliminary data, we expect to
see that behavioral and neural markers of SOR decrease with age, but that this decline happens later than is
typical for youth with ASD, indicating a developmental delay in sensory regulation. We further expect that of our
two candidate top-down mechanisms of sensory regulation that prefrontal-amygdala connectivity but not
thalamic GABA will improve with development, which will inform our understanding of why SOR decreases with
age and how best to treat it at different stages of development. Finally, we will compare the relative ability of
attention cuing vs. reappraisal to engage PFC for youth of different ages and SOR severity. Results will directly
inform both behavioral and psychopharmacological personalized interventions for SOR."
10813218,"There are more than 50 million older adults licensed to drive in the United States. Driving is a complex task
requiring cognitive and sensorimotor skills. Survivors of critical illness experience cognitive, psychological
and physical impairments, known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), that can last months to years
following critical illness. Across the lifespan, ICU recovery has far-reaching implications for independent
functioning, employment, and healthcare utilization, costing billions annually. Older adults are at risk for ICU-
acquired cognitive decline discernible from clinical, biological, and imaging-related changes in the brain
following delirium and critical illness. Similar to other forms of dementia, the combination of normal aging paired
with cognitive deficits associated with critical illness survivorship places these older adults at high risk of
automobile crashes. To address ICU-acquired cognitive decline, driving assessments to characterize risky
driving behaviors are promising to guide driving rehabilitation and intervention development. Rigorous and
reproducible driving safety assessment programs have demonstrated success in post-stroke and dementia
contexts, established via in-vehicle and virtual modes. We hypothesize that in-vehicle driving assessment
and monitoring is a feasible and acceptable approach to assess and address ICU survivor driving safety.
We seek to implement novel in-vehicle cloud-data collection technology developed by our team. We propose to
pair neurocognitive assessments with in-vehicle kinematic driving data to conduct essential formative work
to develop data-based insights into driving behaviors of older adults with ICU-acquired cognitive declines. We
aim to determine protocol feasibility and acceptability of neurocognitive assessments and in-vehicle sensor
deployment (Aim 1). We will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired
cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle
sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. Next, we will evaluate the relationship between
neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors (Aim 2). Lastly, we will
conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for
older ICU survivors (Aim 3). The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and
protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation. As the
population of older drivers grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040 there is an immediate and critical
need to address this impactful issue. This work is designed in response to the NIA Strategic Plan (Goal C-1-9
Safety of Older Drivers) to contribute to a critical gap in health promotion to develop an evidence-based, in-
vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored
to ICU survivors, their care partners and clinicians."
10746016,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The U.S. aging population is rapidly becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and addressing persistent
disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosis and care is an urgent research
priority. Fundamentally, the causes of these disparities remain gravely understudied and the mechanisms
underlying racial and ethnic healthcare inequities are lacking. The primary goal of this project is to elucidate the
role of social determinants of health in racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD diagnosis and care using data from
a nationally representative cohort of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS) linked to administrative claims data. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that social factors will
substantially mediate the relationship between race and ethnicity and ADRD diagnostic and access to care
outcomes. In Aim 1, we will identify key social determinants associated with the timeliness of ADRD diagnosis,
etiological specificity of ADRD diagnosis, and access to ADRD diagnostic care (specialty evaluation and
recommended diagnostic services). In Aim 2, we will empirically test the role of key social determinants of health
as mediators of racial and ethnic disparities in diagnostic and access to care outcomes. The findings will provide
critical contributions to existing health disparities frameworks and, if our hypotheses are supported, will have
direct implications for clinical care by identifying most vulnerable populations in need for interventions and
facilitating the establishment of diagnostic pipelines to guide practitioners and healthcare systems aimed at
reducing health inequities in ADRD."
10825500,"We will continue our study of genes needed for neuronal differentiation and
function using the six touch receptor neurons (TRNs) of the nematode Caenorhabditis

specification, maintenance, and function of the TRNs. In the last grant period, we 1)
identified a “double negative” type of neuronal specification, where an inhibitory
transcription factor prevents the expression of a repressor transcription factor; 2)
analyzed the effects of tubulin mutations on neuronal outgrowth; 3) used the
suppression of mutations affecting a TRN-specific β-tubulin and a TRN-specific α-tubulin
acetyltransferase as sensitized backgrounds to identify other genes needed for neuronal
outgrowth, finding genes needed for protein degradation and gap-junction function; 4)
discovered a novel balancing system needed for proper neurite outgrowth in which the
protein degradation machinery is opposed by the HSP90 chaperone system; 5)
demonstrated the usefulness of the Million Mutation Project (MMP) strains, a collection
of completely sequence strains from the Waterston and Moerman labs, as a tool for
gene discovery and identified many new touch mutants; 6) investigated neuronal
ensheathment and discovered 14 new genes affecting it, including genes that are
important for mechanosensory ECM, adhesion complexes, axon guidance, and axonal
transport; and 7) discovered a synthetic ensheathment phenotype that we will exploit in
the future. The general goal of the research going forward is to exploit these findings to
understand how the differentiation of individual neurons is controlled and how
mechanical inputs are sensed and modified. The most important experiments for the
future are the elucidation of the molecular structure of the transduction complex using
cryo-EM and the discovery and analysis of genes whose loss causes an increase in
touch sensitivity, since these will be negative regulators of touch. We also intend to
continue analyzing the new touch genes uncovered by our work with the MMMP strains,
to revisit the analysis of an important cholesterol-binding component of the touch system
(MEC-2), to exploit the discovery of a synthetic genetic relationship affecting TRN
ensheathment to discover and characterize additional genes needed for this process.
The health relatedness of our work comes from the discovery of new genes and new
interactions among genes that are similar in humans and other mammals."

It is estimated that up to half of patients seeking treatment for substance use disorders have PTSD, and these
individuals have worse treatment outcomes for both conditions. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a common sequela
following trauma and is highly comorbid with PTSD. This project entitled “Opioid-BNST interactions in the
regulation of trauma-induced anxiety states- Towards common substrates in trauma-related disorders and opioid
use disorder comorbidity.” will focus on elucidating the neurobiology of co-morbidity between post-traumatic
stress disorder and opioid use disorder, a highly devastating combination. This proposal aims to test the novel
hypothesis that following a traumatic event, the endogenous opioid system becomes dysregulated in the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) which in turn lead to dysregulated anxiety and could explain vulnerability
to opioid use. Aim 1 will elucidate a putatively anxiolytic circuit, the basomedial amygdala (BMA) to BNST to
lateral hypothalamus (LH). Aim 2 will assess how the BMA-BNST-LH circuit is modulated by mu opioid receptors
to reduce fear and anxiety behaviors and how this system is disrupted following a traumatic stress. Aim 3 will
focus on characterizing in vivo neural activity of BNST-LH neurons in freely behaving mice during fear and
anxiety assays, how this signaling becomes disrupted following a traumatic event, and how the disrupted circuit
normalizes with exogenous opioids.
This project takes advantage of opportunities for independent scientific thinking, technical and professional
training from Dr. Patel and the mentoring committee, and the resources at Vanderbilt while simultaneously
allowing differentiation from his mentors towards an important novel scientific direction. Receiving the K08 will

majority of brain imaging studies have studied the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline in adults aged
65 and older. This convention overlooks one of the most significant neuroendocrine changes in a woman’s life—
the transition to menopause—and leaves a gap in our understanding of the aging brain during the critical midlife
years. The menopausal transition is marked by a sweeping decline in the production of sex hormones—up to
90% in the case of 17b-estradiol and progesterone. Animal studies provide powerful evidence that estradiol and
progesterone play a neuroprotective role in brain regions vulnerable to neurodegeneration, including the
prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which female reproductive aging leads to
changes in human brain morphology, intrinsic brain network connectivity, and susceptibility to increased AD
prevalence represents a significant knowledge gap that has yet to be adequately examined. This proposal will
establish whether the decline in sex steroid hormones over the menopausal transition relates to vulnerability in
brain circuits implicated in AD. In the F99 phase (Aim 1), I will probe the effects of reproductive aging on the
brain in healthy women (N=90, ages 45–55), investigating the endocrine basis of neural aging in midlife. The
well-characterized sample is enriched to include a balanced distribution of pre, peri, and post-menopausal
women across a limited age range in order to isolate the effects of reproductive aging from chronological aging.
I will first determine how the depletion of sex hormones in midlife alters large-scale functional brain networks
using resting-state fMRI and computational approaches from complex systems analysis. I will then use high-
resolution anatomical imaging of the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe to determine whether
the depletion of sex hormones impacts specific hippocampal subfields (CA1-3, dentate gyrus, subiculum) and
entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, regions enriched with sex hormone receptors. In the K00
phase (Aim 2), I will take the skills and insights gained from the F99 phase, including fundamental training in
neuroendocrinology and brain imaging, and use them to establish the relationship between female reproductive
aging and pathological AD biomarkers (b-amyloid, tau). To do this, I will leverage two large community cohorts
(N~620, 60% female) that provide relevant hormonal, cognitive, and molecular positron emission tomography
(PET) data from midlife subjects (ages 40-65) and build a neuroendocrine model of AD risk. Together, this
proposal will identify the role menopause plays in contributing to female-specific vulnerability to Alzheimer’s
disease, a severely understudied area in cognitive neuroscience with clear implications for women’s health."

Focal epilepsy is a network disease marked by focal areas of cortical hyperexcitability and interconnected brain
regions that affect excitability. For many patients, it is challenging to accurately localize brain regions involved
in seizure initiation and to determine nodes of the seizure network that affect excitability on an individual basis.
We hypothesize that seizure-related brain tissue is chronically compromised and exhibits aberrant, interictal,
hyperexcitability that can be interrogated dynamically using stimulation. We propose using novel stimulation-
based biomarkers to develop reliable and precise estimates of seizure onset locations and related network
nodes. Whereas stimulation-based biomarkers have typically utilized single pulses of electrical stimulation to
map connectivity, we propose two diagnostic stimulation biomarkers which utilize multiple stimulation pulses,
novel waveforms and time-varying amplitude envelopes to interrogate adaptation and inhibitory feedback.
Leveraging high-channel count stimulation, we suggest a method to rapidly map modulatory network
connections which could serve as implanted device targets. We utilize simultaneous single unit recordings to
underpin our proposed invasive EEG biomarkers of hyperexcitability.
Our aims are to: 1) Develop stimulation-based biomarkers of the seizure onset zone, 2) Identify patient-
specific, modulatory network connections, and 3) Determine whether there are interictal single neuron
signatures of hyperexcitability. To do this, we will use a newly developed external stimulator will allow for
automated, efficient stimulation of 128-256 channels in epilepsy patients implanted with temporary invasive
electrodes. Simultaneous recordings from microelectrodes will allow us to correlate single and multiunit activity
with EEG activity recorded from macroelectrodes. We will examine these results within the novel mathematical
framework of fractional dynamics that can link the timescales of responses to excitability.
Grant outcomes will include a rapid protocol using stimulation-based interictal biomarkers to localize the
seizure onset zone and identify relevant network nodes. Microelectrode recordings will provide a
single/multiunit scale understanding of EEG excitability dynamics. This proposal explores the largely uncharted
territory of stimulation-based biomarkers beyond single pulse electrical stimulation to improve treatment for
drug-resistant epilepsy."

Our broad goal is to reduce the consequences caused by premature aging through addressing key research
gaps that represent challenges to more effective mitigation efforts, particularly in low- and middle-income
countries. Our central working hypothesis is that optimal early-life nutrition reduces physiologic aging, specifically
via persistent impacts on DNA-related mechanisms (DNA methylation [DNAm], telomere length) over the human
life course. The rationale extends key previous findings from the study team, particularly that (1) gestational
exposure to the Dutch famine resulted in observable epigenetic differences in adulthood; (2) telomere length of
infants and children differ by early-life maternal factors and metabolic indicators; and (3) exposure to a nutrition
supplementation intervention led to reduced diabetes incidence at age 37-52 y. We have been following a unique
cohort of individuals who participated as children in a nutrition supplementation intervention trial conducted in
four villages in Guatemala from 1969 to 1977. We define full intervention exposure as the first 1,000 days of life
between conception and two years of age; participants with full exposure will be compared to those with partial
(0-999 of these ‘first 1,000 days’) and no intervention exposure. In this study, we propose to extract DNA from
frozen buffy coats collected between 2015-2017 from these now-adult cohort participants (n=1,139). We will
assay samples for DNAm and leukocyte telomere length, which are two mammalian aging hallmarks. In Aim 1,
we will evaluate the impact of nutrition supplementation during the first 1,000 days on DNAm patterns and DNAm-
calculated epigenetic age, including PhenoAge and other epigenetic clocks. We will also further examine CpG
sites associated with early-life nutrition exposure with Mendelian randomization to assess causal associations
with diabetes or BMI. In Aim 2, we will determine whether (1) nutrition supplementation during the first 1,000
days, and (2) life course nutritional status trajectories are associated with longer leukocyte telomere length. This
innovative study will be an opportunity to examine the effectiveness of an actionable early-life nutrition
intervention on the human health span. It will be the first epigenome-wide association study utilizing Mendelian
randomization to assess early-life nutrition supplementation and adult metabolic outcomes to our knowledge. If
successful, this study has the potential to identify novel subclinical physiologic aging indices that are nutrition-
sensitive, which could lead to better intervention impact assessment and prevention strategies for premature
aging. This innovative, multidisciplinary study is optimally suited to answer profound questions relating to early-
life determinants of the human health span in adulthood. It builds upon extensive (>50y) and productive (>300
published papers) experience with this cohort, and a successful history of collaboration among experienced and
productive researchers at Emory University, the Institute of Central America and Panama, and Vitalant Research
Institute."
10764277,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dr. Neha Lodha is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health and Exercise Science at Colorado State
University (CSU). Dr. Lodha's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator advancing the
science of functional mobility to improve the quality of life in aging and age-related neurological disorders and
dementias. Up to this point, Dr. Lodha has acquired strong scientific background in neurophysiology and motor
control. To accomplish her career goal, a key additional element required is the training in cognitive sciences.
Understanding how cognitive and motor systems interact to enable independent mobility is important for
identifying the precise mechanisms and developing interventions to promote functional mobility. The short-term
training goals of the current K01 application are to train in 1) conducting cognitive assessments with specific
emphasis on the intra-individual variability (IIV) approach, 2) clinical trials design and analysis, 3) multivariate
statistics, 4) driving technology, and 5) transition to independence. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lodha has
assembled a mentoring team that consists of 1) an eminent gerontologist, Dr. Manfred Diehl (primary mentor)
with expertise in aging, IIV and cognitive development across the lifespan, 2) an experimental psychologist, Dr.
Karlene Ball (co-mentor) who is internationally renowned for her work in cognitive correlates of driving mobility
in aging and dementia, 3) a vascular neurologist, Dr. Sharon Poisson (advisor) with extensive experience in
clinical trials in stroke survivors, and 4) a renowned biostatistician, Dr. Haonan Wang (co-advisor) with
experience in statistical inference and modeling for clinical data. The proposed research plan focuses on
identifying the motor and cognitive impairments underlying driving deficits in older stroke survivors with mild
cognitive impairment as they are most likely to resume on-road driving after stroke. Conventionally, driving
impairments are shown to be independently influenced by mean-level performance in specific motor and
cognitive domains. However, this mean-level approach neglects the well-established fact that performance
becomes highly variable and unstable in older adults with neurological disorders, such as those at preclinical
stages of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive imapirment. The proposed research will apply the novel intra-
individual variability (IIV) approach to investigate driving mobility in older stroke survivors. The goal of the
research plan is to identify the impact of stroke on IIV in motor and cognitive performance (Aim 1); determine the
contribution of IIV measures to predict driving performance (Aim 2); and use IIV measures to predict change in
driving performance over a two-year period (Aim 3). The training plan will accelerate Dr. Lodha's career to pursue
a unique and independent line of research that combines cognitive and motor processes to promote the
functional mobility of older adults and is directly aligned with NIA's AD/ADRD goal to identify sensitive behavioral
measures for earliest manifestations of functional impairments in older adults."

The tectorial membrane (TM) is an extracellular matrix (ECM) that lies over the organ of Corti. The TM plays
important roles in frequency selection, propagation, and amplification of sound waves. Malformation of the TM
causes hereditary hearing deficits. Since the TM is an acellular structure, its unique properties arise from the
matrix architecture. The TM exhibits sophisticated ultrastructural features and domain-specific patterns of
matrix organization. However, the mechanisms by which the specific matrix architectures are organized
outside of cells are unknown. Is it determined by its molecular composition and/or mode of organization? We
observed that surface-tethering of a-tectorin/TECTA via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor is required
to prevent diffusion of secreted TM components into the luminal space of the scala media and to form the TM
matrix on the apical surface of TM-producing cells. The release of TECTA plays a critical role in the growth of
the TM layers. Our in vitro assays show that TECTA is released from the producing cells by multiple
mechanisms and that the different forms of TECTA released by these distinct mechanisms show unique
multimerization activities. In this proposal, we will determine the molecular mechanism by which TECTA
mediates the organization of specific TM architecture. We will characterize molecular dynamics that occur
during the matrix maturation. Our results will provide the first evidence of how a complex ECM structure is
established and matures in the extracellular space at the molecular level. This will provide novel insights into
the process of morphogenesis as well as the mechanism of hereditary and age-related hearing deficits."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in childhood. Despite rigorous clinical trials
the survival for children with high-risk RMS has not changed for three decades. The children that do survive
often suffer from life-long disfigurements as a result of the aggressive treatment. RMS is subdivided into two
major classes, fusion-positive (FP-RMS) and fusion-negative (FN-RMS), based on the presence or absence of
the PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 gene fusions. RMS resembles developing skeletal muscle and has been
speculated to originate from genetically compromised skeletal muscle progenitors. Despite the expression of
skeletal muscle master regulator proteins MYOD1 and MYOGENIN, RMS tumors and cells fail to terminally
differentiate, suggesting that RMS is an arrested state of muscle development. The molecular underpinnings of
the differentiation arrest in RMS and therapeutics to drive differentiation are unknown. The long-term goal is to
elucidate the mechanisms that determine the basis for developmental arrest in RMS and design novel, directed
drug therapies for RMS. A study recently identified PTEN promoter hypermethylation with decrease PTEN
expression in over 90% of FN-RMS tumors. In a RMS genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), PTEN loss
decreased tumor latency, increased tumor penetrance, and much less differentiated tumors more closely
resembling the embryonal RMS in children. PTEN loss did not increase mTOR signaling but was localized in the
nucleus and increased PAX7 expression and ectopic DBX1 expression. DBX1 is a neuronal specific
transcriptional repressor that is ectopically expressed across both human FN-RMS and FP-RMS. Forced DBX1
expression blocks myogenic differentiation in cultured myoblasts. The central hypothesis is that the PTEN-PAX7-
DBX1 axis provides a key node in the developmental arrest in RMS and that DBX1 functions as a transcriptional
repressor blocking differentiation in RMS. The objective of this proposal is to leverage our robust RMS mouse
models coupled with in vitro assays to define the role of PTEN and DBX1 in RMS. To accomplish this objective,
we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the role of PTEN loss in RMS. 2) Determine the mechanism
of DBX1 regulation in RMS. 3) Identify role of DBX1 in blocking myogenic differentiation in RMS. The proposed
studies leverage a simple, rapid RMS GEMM to dissect genes that contribute to RMS biology in vivo and provide
insight into the mechanism maintaining an arrested state of differentiation in RMS. We will use gain- and loss-
of-function approaches both in vivo and in vitro to dissect the roles of AKT1, mTORC1, PAX7 and DBX1 in
modulation of the PTEN loss phenotype. Differentiation therapy of embryonal tumors has proven an efficacious
venue for therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid for neuroblastoma and all-trans-retinoic acid for acute promyelocytic
leukemia. Molecular and developmental dissection of RMS will reveal new vulnerabilities to develop new
therapeutics to drive terminal differentiation of RMS. These studies will have broad impact as DBX1 is highly
expressed in pediatric brain tumors and PTEN perturbations are involved in many cancers."

Chronic psychosocial stress exposure is a potent but largely under-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular
disease (CVD); however, the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. Chronic stress triggers a neurohormo-
nal response, but the upstream brain centers initiating this cascade are incompletely defined. Several recent
studies have shown that higher stress is associated with increased inflammation that drives CVD. Furthermore,
a growing body of research shows a benefit for stress reduction in individuals with CVD via modification of
brain activity and reduction of systemic inflammation and CVD symptoms. Advanced imaging with positron
emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) provides an opportunity to reproducibly
evaluate the neurobiological activity of stress-associated neural centers (e.g., the amygdala) that participate in
the initiation of this pathway while concurrently evaluating the activities of several other tissues that may partic-
ipate in this mechanism, such as the bone marrow and arterial wall, to derive novel mechanistic insights.
Within this paradigm, our group has shown that heightened activity of the amygdala associates with increased
bone marrow activity and increased inflammation of the arterial wall. The current proposal addresses these
knowledge gaps by assessing the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on arterial inflammation (Aim
1) as well as amygdalar activity and systemic inflammation (Aim 2) in individuals with known coronary artery
disease using PET/MRI. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 36 subjects randomized to stress reduction
or usual care who will undergo baseline and follow-up imaging and inflammatory biomarkers. Subjects with
confounding conditions (i.e., psychiatric or neurologic disease, etc.) will be excluded. Dr. Michael Osborne is
an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) who is highly
qualified and invested in leading this study. He has a unique background in engineering and advanced imaging
and a track record of successful research, including publications and awards, using several imaging modalities.
Via this proposal, he will develop expertise in multi-system PET/MRI and improve his foundation in the imple-
mentation of clinical trials, biostatistics, inflammation biology, stress, and mind-body medicine while generating
the data and profile needed to transition to R-level independent NIH-supported research. His long-term goal is
to apply multi-parametric PET/MRI to better understand the relationship between stress and physical disease
and identify effective treatments. He is supported by a well-qualified mentorship team that is led by Dr. Ahmed
Tawakol, a cardiologist with expertise in PET, and includes other NIH-funded investigators in radiology, psychi-
atry, epidemiology, and cardiology. His institutional environment is robust and has a long history of supporting
the development of early investigators via myriad resources including didactics, facilities, and mentorship. The
MGH Division of Cardiology has made a strong commitment to Dr. Osborne with assurance of 75% of pro-
tected time for this proposal to foster his career as an autonomous investigator."

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique subset of innate immune cells capable of multiple functions
essential for antiviral responses, including type I interferon production, antigen-presentation and T cell activation.
The mechanisms that govern these distinct pDC functions remain poorly defined; however, they could be
mediated by distinct subpopulations. Using high-dimensional single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic
approaches, we and others recently discovered a novel human dendritic cell (DC) population that is captured
within traditional pDC definitions. These cells harbor phenotypic features of both pDCs and conventional DC
subsets (cDCs); thus, we called them transitional DCs or tDCs. We have now performed an integrated
multidimensional comparison that resulted in the identification of the mouse homolog of human tDCs. The
discovery that tDCs occur in both human and mouse suggests they have an evolutionarily conserved role during
immune responses. However, tDC function has never been investigated. Similarly, the developmental origin of
tDCs has not yet been analyzed. This represents a fundamental gap in our understanding of the cellular
components that mediate innate immune responses against viruses and poses an impediment to the
development of therapeutics. Based on our preliminary data generated in mouse, we hypothesize that tDCs and
pDCs form a distinct developmental lineage that cooperates at the site of viral infection to modulate immune
responses. In three specific aims, we propose to query tDC origin, function and relationship with pDCs. To
achieve these aims, we will take advantage of high-dimensional approaches already established in our lab, in
vitro and in vivo differentiation assays, and novel lineage tracing and cell-specific depletion mouse models. We
anticipate that findings from this proposal will enhance our current understanding of innate cellular pathways that
result in the positive outcome of viral infection. Importantly, our integrated approach will incorporate analyses of
both mouse and human tDCs; thus, it has the potential to reveal features of the innate immune compartment
that are conserved between species. This proposal has the potential to impact the rational design of future
therapeutic strategies."
10793481,"Protocol Title: A dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the
National Dental Practice Based Research Network
Summary
There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may
interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-
implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa,
and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of
biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an
academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice
Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the
prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for
subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead
to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across
the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the
recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data
gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed
to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will
guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation
of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and
comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs
for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about
the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications,
risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices.
We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and
the quality of care provided for the patients."

The mission of the ITN is to advance the clinical application of immune tolerance by performing
high quality clinical trials of emerging therapeutics based upon testable mechanistic hypotheses.
The ITN is structured in order to interrogate different diseases across the immunologic
spectrum, with integration of innovative clinical studies and cutting edge immunology laboratory
analysis. The ITN approach—clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while we
simultaneously evaluate the cellular, genetic, and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how
they are altered in response to therapy—creates a framework for advancing cross-disease and
cross-discipline knowledge, all designed to accelerate therapeutic options for major diseases.
In this renewal application, we describe the scientific and operational framework that will enable
the ITN to successfully enhance the development of tolerance therapies in transplantation,
autoimmunity, and allergy. We outline a process to evolve our current strategies into the next
generation of planned trials, as well as how we plan to operate a nimble, future-focused
organization, poised to lead and adopt innovations that are currently unknown. We propose a
collaborative structure involving hundreds of investigators, advisors, and clinical sites working in
tandem with a core group of ITN staff, operating a program that is both scientifically and
financially efficient. Several new innovations recently adopted by the ITN will encourage
widespread involvement from academic investigators, including expanded resource sharing and
data sharing operations. With lead institutional commitment from the Benaroya Research
Institute and the University of California San Francisco, and participation of more than 20 other
major institutions represented in leadership and major advisory roles, the ITN strives to continue
to successfully pioneer high impact clinical trials and mechanistic studies in areas of unmet

Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have a median survival of 6 months. Chemotherapy in
combination with surgery and radiation may modestly extend survival of ATC confined to the neck but offers
minimal benefit in patients with metastatic disease. Recently, combination treatment using the RAF inhibitor
dabrafenib with the MEK inhibitor trametinib showed a 69% ORR and dramatic tumor regression in BRAFV600E-
driven ATCs, which is the first meaningful advance in the treatment of this disease. In contrast, response to
this same combination in BRAF-driven differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is 33%. The remarkable dab/tram
effects in BRAF-ATCs provide a roadmap to explore the therapeutic vulnerabilities in this disease. A hallmark
of ATCs is their heavy infiltration with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with M2 polarization. TAMs are
associated with a worse prognosis in thyroid and other cancers, attributed in part to their suppression of
immune surveillance. Although ATCs are also enriched for T cells, a pilot trial of immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) showed no efficacy in this disease, including in two ATCs with microsatellite-instability, predicted to
harbor numerous neoantigens. Based on a mouse model of Braf-driven ATC that we developed, which
recapitulates the immune milieu of the human disease, we propose that profound MAPK pathway inhibition
blocks production of tumor-derived cytokines governing TAM recruitment and maintenance, leading to their
depletion and the consequent de-repression of T cell cytotoxicity. We hypothesize that MAPK blockade
primarily accounts for this TME response, and that TAMs and MAPK regulation of ATC antigen presentation
play a central role in the process. To understand the relative contribution of these mechanisms we will: 1)
Identify ATC cell-derived cytokines that recruit infiltrating myeloid cell populations. We identified a MAPK-
driven cytokine panel in BRAF-ATCs and will determine individual cytokine contributions to myeloid recruitment
using genetic and pharmacological approaches. 2) Determine the role of TAMs in response to therapy. We will
first investigate whether TAMs block T-cell responses to model antigens (Pmel and/or Tyrp1) in ATCs in vivo.
We will perform genetic or pharmacological depletion of TAMs to determine the optimal approach to enhance T
cell responses, then determine the effects of TAM depletion or repolarization on T cell response to tumor cell
autonomous neoantigens, and whether these can further enhance efficacy of ICB in mouse Braf/p53 ATCs. 3)
Determine the role of tumor cell antigen presentation in T cell response following MAPK inhibition and whether
the magnitude or duration of response can be enhanced by Pd1 blockade. 4) Determine sequential changes in
the immune landscape of human BRAFV600E ATCs in response to preoperative treatment with dab/tram and
during a combination trial of dab/tram with the PD1 inhibitor Cemiplimab."

brings together a talented group of investigators with expertise in basic biology (DFCI and Whitehead Institute
at MIT), clinical science (IFM), as well as genomic and cell signaling (DFCI and Broad Institute). During the prior
years of funding period, we have 1. Defined the role of transplant in the era of novel agents; 2 Established the
role of molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) in myeloma; 3. Identified and validated number of novel
genomic and epigenomic targets; and 4. Defined patterns of clonal evolution and mutational signatures being
utilized in MM. Our program has also developed novel targeted sequencing platform, deciphered the genomic
landscape and chronology of copy number alterations in MM, developed a pipeline to identify mutations using
RNA-seq, and developed a publicly available data analysis portal (Canevolve.org). Building on these advances,
the overall specific objectives of the program are 1) to determine whether high-dose therapy provides benefit if
MRD negative status is achieved, to define the role of sustained MRD negativity in 716 patients randomized

2009 and the proposed clinical trial will be utilized to study genomic and epigenomic correlates (All Projects)
Project 2 will advance our understanding of the regulation of transcriptional condensates and their biochemical
environment. Project 3 will identify and validate the long non-coding RNA dependencies responsible for
continued MM cell growth and develop strategies to interrupt their activities as a novel therapeutic approach.
New targeted therapeutic agents will be translated to clinical trials to improve patient outcome. Project 4 will
define the impact of clonal complexity and identify mediators of genomic instability underlying disease
progression in MM and develop novel inhibitors targeting genomic instability. These 4 projects will be supported
by Administrative and Communication Core (1), Clinical and Tissue Core (2); Epigenomics Core (3); Genomic

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is among the world's most disabling diseases, and it accounts for a substantial
percentage of the increase in disability life years. The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study has made major
contributions to our understanding of the course of OA and identification of risk factors for its incidence and
progression. Beginning in 2003, the MOST initially enrolled 3026 participants with or at high risk of knee OA. In
the most recent phase (MOST3), an additional 1525 participants who were slightly younger and unlikely to have
advanced disease were enrolled. Despite the insights provided by the previous phases of MOST, there are still
no treatments available that slow progression of OA. The next phase (MOST4) focuses on three major scientific

Diabetic patients have a two-fold greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease than non-diabetic subjects,
and more than 65% of diabetic patients die from cardiovascular complications, thus, there is a critical need for
novel approaches to targeting insulin resistance, obesity, and atherosclerosis in this population. Recent
evidence has suggested that innate and/or adaptive inflammatory responses are associated with both insulin
resistance and obesity, while atherosclerosis is now widely accepted to be a lipid-dependent chronic
inflammatory disease. An increasing body of literature has established an inverse correlation between chronic
helminth infections and metabolic syndrome/diabetes. The central hypothesis of this project is that
schistosome antigenic exposure induces long-lived modifications in the monocyte/macrophage lineage that
lead to profound alterations in systemic phospholipid, cholesterol, and amino acid metabolism, resulting in a
protective state from the detrimental effects of High Fat Diet (HFD) (e.g., insulin insensitivity, and
atherosclerosis). The rationale for this research is that identifying genetic drivers that underlie this protective
phenotype is expected to enable the formulation and development of therapies to target these pathways as
treatments for diabetic patients at risk for CVD. This objective will be addressed by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Define the role of S. mansoni infection in regulating the long-term metabolic and immunological
function of macrophages; 2) Determine how S. mansoni infection regulates hematopoietic differentiation of
macrophages at the transcriptional level; and 3) Determine the role of biological sex and sex hormones in
schistosome induced metabolic reprogramming. It is expected that the findings from these studies will provide
a definitive conceptual framework as to the mechanism through which S. mansoni infection modulates
metabolism and immunologic plasticity of the macrophage lineage."
10754589,"CANDIDATE: Alaina Vidmar is a pediatric clinical scientist specializing in treatment of adolescents with obesity
and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The proposed study will focus on investigating if time-limited eating (TLE: 8-hour
eating/16-hour fasting) in adolescents with T2D reduces glycemic excursions, delays β-cell dysfunction, and
reduces body fat mass compared to prolonged eating period (12+hours). This K23 Award will provide her with
advanced training in clinical trial design and advanced statistical methods, pediatric nutrition and body
composition measurement, and glucose monitoring technology, all of which are required for her to compete for
independent R01 funding. RESEARCH CONTEXT: Preliminary evidence, mostly in adults, has shown that TLE
reduces body weight and fat mass, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic fat accumulation, and is safe
with minimal risk when compared to prolonged eating windows and has no negative effect on daily function or
lifestyle behaviors. 1–12 Because of its simplicity, TLE may represent a more feasible approach for adolescents
than other caloric restriction regimens. Our preliminary data support TLE feasibility, acceptability, and safety in
adolescents with obesity, with and without diabetes.13–15 However, no trial to date has studied the effects of TLE
on glycemic control and body composition in adolescents with T2D. We hypothesize that TLE will reduce
glycemic excursions, improve β-cell function, and reduce body fat mass in adolescents with T2D when compared
to prolonged eating periods. One-hundred adolescents with T2D (aged 14-21 years), with a hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) < 9%, and on Metformin monotherapy, will be recruited. All participants will be randomized to one of
two meal-timing schedules to be followed for 12 weeks: (1) Control: >12-hour eating or (2) TLE. We will examine
the effects of TLE versus control in 3 specific aims: (1) Effects on glucose control as measured by percent time
in range (captured from continuous glucose monitoring data), Hemoglobin A1c, and β-cell function (mean change
in insulinogenic index after a mixed meal tolerance test); (2) Effects on body composition and liver fat (DEXA
and magnetic resonance imaging); and (3) Effects on sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake. CAREER
DEVELOPMENT: Dr. Vidmar has access to a rich academic research environment, one of the largest pediatric
T2D populations in the country, the support of her institution, and a stellar mentoring committee consisting of (1)
Dr. Goran, a pediatric nutritional scientist, (2) Dr. Raymond, a physician-scientist with expertise in diabetes
technology, (3) Dr. Ramon Durazo-Arvizu, a statistician, (4) Dr. Espinoza, an expert in clinical bioinformatics,
and (5) Dr. Salvy, a behavioral and clinical psychologist with expertise in TLE implementation. The two co-
primary mentors, Drs. Goran and Raymond will be responsible for guiding Dr. Vidmar in achieving the milestones
towards transition to independence. In summary, this proposal meets a critical need for finding an effective
dietary intervention for treatment of adolescents with T2D and provides Dr. Vidmar with a robust training platform,
and structured mentoring path towards an R01-level competitive application."
10757680,"Abstract
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are heterogenous and poorly understood hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) failure syndromes common in individuals >60 years of age. With increased life expectancies, the
incidence of MDS continues to rise, and will soon be the most prevalent hematologic disorder in elderly.
There are no effective treatments for MDS patients, due to an insufficient understanding of the underlying
pathobiology and a lack of faithful mouse models. Our research program is focused on filling these gaps,
and then leveraging the resulting knowledge and tools to develop effective drug therapies. Already, we
have discovered genetically-driven aberrant activation of innate immune pathways in MDS HSCs. We
have also identified a critical function of innate immune pathways in normal HSCs, which has
implications for chronic immune-related disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and hematopoiesis. We
hypothesize that dysregulated innate immune signaling is a major contributor to the initiation and
development of MDS, and is a feasible therapeutic target. Herein, we propose to test this hypothesis by
carrying out the following complimentary 3-part research program: (1) Dissect the genetic and cellular
underpinnings of MDS HSCs, with an emphasis on cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic immune-inflammatory
factors. (2) Identify and characterize novel signaling pathways driving MDS phenotype in HSCs. (3)
Develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MDS. The results of our research program will
advance our paradigm-shifting model of the initiation, progression, and treatment of MDS."
10912835,"Readiness for Change Scale: Adaptation and Validation for Mental Health Task-Sharing
PROJECT SUMMARY:
Mental health task-sharing, or the involvement of non-specialist health workers (NSHWs) such as community
health workers (CHWs) to make mental health care more available and accessible, has been proven to be
efficacious in randomized controlled trials in multiple low-resource settings including low- and middle-income
countries. However, in routine care settings, the impact of mental health programs based on task-sharing
paradigm greatly depend on its adoption by CHWs and the fidelity with which they implement it which, in-turn, is
influenced by their readiness for change (RFC). However, there is dearth of literature assessing the role of RFC
as an important predictor of CHW adoption and fidelity within mental health task-sharing. Importantly, research
on RFC among CHWs within mental health task-sharing is hindered by the absence of a culturally-adapted,
reliable, and valid measurement tool. To address this significant gap in research and knowledge, we build on
our previous qualitative work investigating the cultural- and context-specific nuances of RFC among Accredited
Social Health Activists (ASHAs), a cadre of female CHWs in India, for engaging in mental health task-sharing.
Utilizing our qualitative findings, we aim to adapt the Readiness for Change Scale and translate it into Marathi
language by following the World Health Organization's recommendations on scale translation. In addition, we
aim to assess the content and construct validity, as well as internal consistency of the translated (Marathi) version
of the Readiness for Change Scale among n=330 ASHAs in Rahata sub-district of Ahmednagar district in the
state of Maharashtra, India. We will assess content validity through involving an expert panel, and calculate
content validity ratios and a content validity index. For evaluating construct (convergent) validity, we will calculate
the correlation between the revised scale scores and scores from the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Furthermore,
we will use Cronbach's alpha to assess the internal consistency of the revised scale, and factor analysis to
identify scale constructs. The outcome of this study—an adapted and validated measure for RFC among CHWs
for mental health task-sharing—will build a solid foundation to develop and test an implementation strategy to
build RFC among CHWs for mental health task-sharing through NIH's R21 funding mechanism which will be
useful for low-resource setting globally, including the United States."
10834999,"About 35% of U.S. adults engage in comfort eating, defined as increasing one’s food intake or eating high-
calorie/fat/sugar foods in response to stress or other negative emotions. Comfort eating predicts subsequent
weight gain and also mediates links between stress and depressive symptoms with Body Mass Index (BMI).
Beyond effects on BMI, many unhealthy comfort foods are ultra-processed foods high in saturated fat, sugar,
and salt—foods that heighten risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Moreover, experiments manipulating comfort
eating do not evidence any meaningful causal benefits of this behavior for psychophysiological stress
responses. These adverse characteristics of comfort eating have motivated interventions; however, efforts to
curb comfort eating have neglected to attempt to prevent its initial development in early life—an approach that
could minimize negative health impacts across the lifespan. Furthermore, intervention reviews have concluded
that resulting effect sizes are often small (e.g., Cohen’s d = 0.12 to 0.26) or inconsistent (Cohen’s d = -0.17 to
0.04), and scholars have called for additional research to determine which intervention methods are most
appropriate for which individuals. Relatedly, although self-efficacy—how confident people are that they can
perform a certain behavior—is a robust predictor of both behavioral intentions and actual behavior in other
literatures, little is known about which factors are associated with self-efficacy for comfort eating cessation. To
address these critical gaps in knowledge, we will analyze data from the Eating in America Study collected from
December 2019 to January 2020 among a national census-matched sample of 2,022 U.S. adults age 18 and
older, carrying out the following specific aims: 1) Characterize the etiology of comfort eating from a life course
perspective using a mixed-methods approach; 2) Identify demographic, comfort food, belief, developmental,
and psychosocial factors associated with self-efficacy to quit comfort eating; and 3) Determine which sub-
populations may be at elevated risk for poor health outcomes associated with comfort eating. This research will
generate new knowledge regarding how stages in the lifespan, life events, and the familial environment may
play a role in the origins of comfort eating. Furthermore, this project will be the first in a large, national sample
to examine self-efficacy to quit comfort eating and the key factors that explain it—data that could reveal new
levers for influencing this key construct and thereby, comfort eating itself. Finally, this investigation will provide
new insights into which sub-populations may be at greater risk of the poor health that comes with comfort
eating. Equipped with these novel insights generated with support from the NIDDK (PAR-21-313), in the next
stage of her transition to research independence, the PI (Dr. Finch) will move forward with her long-term goal
of developing and testing a new generation of targeted, tailored, and innovative comfort eating prevention and
intervention techniques. For instance, novel techniques may include prevention in childhood or adolescence by
targeting parental behaviors, and/or changing beliefs about comforting capacities of comfort eating."
10783790,"Natural and synthetic RNAs play key roles in cellular function, biotechnology, and medicine. RNAs fold into
intricate structures, which often drive their functions, thus determining RNA structure is fundamental to biology
and biotechnology. Computational thermodynamics-based secondary structure modeling (TSSM) is a popular,
low-cost, and rapid approach to structure prediction, which has enabled transcriptome-wide structure-function
studies and massive structure-based screens of synthetic RNA libraries. However, recent evidence suggests
that a diversity of post-transcriptional chemical nucleotide modifications additionally exert profound impact on
local and/or global structure, to ultimately modulate the RNA’s stability, expression, or regulatory function. Such
modifications are widespread in all life domains and represent a new and poorly understood layer of gene
regulation, which has been implicated in disease. Moreover, they are routinely introduced into RNA medicines
as a means of evading the innate immune response. Taken together, the wealth of natural modifications and
development of novel artificial ones, the growing interest in their mechanism, and their centrality to RNA medicine
underscore a pressing need to determine structures of RNAs with modified nucleotides rapidly and accurately.
However, TSSM methods cannot account for the effects of modifications due to a lack of parameters to estimate
their folding stabilities. They rely on the feature-rich Turner nearest-neighbor (NN) thermodynamic model, which
is parameterized by 294 free-energy change values derived for canonical bases from 802 costly and laborious
UV melting experiments. Given the diverse and rapidly expanding pool of modifications, it is impractical to repeat
such experiments for each type. The premise of this proposal is that NN parameters can be learned more
efficiently from alternative experiments, which are affordable, widely accessible, and high throughput.
Specifically, next-generation sequencing has transformed RNA Structure Probing (SP) into a routine massively
parallel experiment, which reports structural information about local nucleotide dynamics. SP is widely used to
gain insights into RNA structure and function from genome-wide studies and to constrain TSSM algorithms to
improve their predictions. However, unlike melting assays, the relationship between RNA folding stability and SP
measurements is highly nontrivial, and thus the problem of recovering the parameters from SP data is difficult.
The goal of this proposal is to develop novel algorithms and software to estimate NN parameters from
high-throughput SP data. We will design statistical inference methods that reconcile information from folding
algorithms and SP experiments and apply them to data for unmodified and modified RNAs to estimate new
parameters for modified nucleotides. As the link between SP data and folding thermodynamics is complex, and
furthermore, the ability to fit the Turner parameters from SP data has not been explored, we will assess the
feasibility, accuracy, performance, and computational efficiency of the developed methods. Validation
efforts will include comparing to experimentally derived values and evaluating predictions over held-out data."
10558606,"Abstract
While wireless monitoring of intracardiac pressure using implants is essential for the management of heart
failure, miniaturizing these implants is critical for reducing their associated complications. Current implants mainly
consist of an electromagnetic antenna, electronics, and energy-storage and conversion units. However, these
units contain toxic materials, and a large antenna is necessary to transmit the large wavelengths (>5 cm) of
electromagnetic waves. The size and inorganic components of the current implants increase the risk of
complications for patients.
Ultrasound technology is promising to replace electromagnetic waves for in vivo wireless communications. It is
safe, does not interfere with other electromagnetic signals, has lower in vivo signal attenuation, and permits the
use of significantly smaller antennas and implants due to its sub-millimeter wavelength. Therefore,
communication through ultrasound is ideal for use in minimally invasive pressure monitoring implants. The long-
term objective is to develop an ultrasound-based, wireless technology that will miniaturize intracardiac implants
by eliminating both the electromagnetic antenna and the energy storage and conversion units. The objective of
this project is to utilize flexible, acoustic microresonators (100 to 500 µm thick films) with compressible
microcavities for physiological pressure measurements of atriums and ventricles.
Our central hypothesis is that the post-processing of echo signals from the resonators and their resonant
frequencies can detect intracardiac pressure changes. Our rationale is that micro-fabricated films made from
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) form acoustic resonators. Incorporating gas/void filled microcavities into the PDMS
film creates a resonator that is sensitive to the pressure difference between the inside and outside. Changing
the differential pressure causes deformations of the resonator. These deformations shift the film's resonant
frequency allowing for the detection of pressure changes.
Our specific aims are to 1) prove the measurement sensitivity of the resonator underwater at the ventricular and
atrial physiological pressures with the resolution of ~1mmHg and temporal resolution of 40 (ms); 2) demonstrate
the safety of an implantable device in vitro by incorporating hemocompatible materials, testing a device's
durability, and testing in a specially designed phantom; and 3) prove that the implant is suitable for a minimally
invasive delivery (transseptal procedure) on a benchtop test setup. Upon project completion, the technology can
be immediately employed to create safer next-generation in vivo pressure monitoring implants that operate solely
using acoustic waves. This contribution is significant because it can aid over 6 million Americans who live with
Heart Failure (HF), resulting in chronic hospitalizations that cost $16 billion. The proposed research is innovative
because this technology employs only acoustic waves; avoids energy conversion, storage units, and
electromagnetic antennas; and significantly reduces an implant's size and complications."
10932844,"The Focus: Localized provoked vulvodynia (LPV) is the most common cause of chronic dyspareunia (painful
intercourse) in premenopausal women, and it remains a poorly understood disease. Existing therapies do not
target the underlying causes, treatment is trial and error, and intervention typically escalates to cutting away
the painful tissue surrounding the vaginal opening, the vestibule. This proposal aims to identify new targets to
treat LPV pain in alignment with the missions of at least two NIH institutes by aiming to 1) improve women’s
health care (NICHD) and 2) identify non-addictive targets for pain therapy (NIDA).
The Premise: We discovered a non-classical inflammatory response in the vestibule of LPV patients that is a
key contributor to LPV pain. The vestibule of LPV patients is hypersensitive to inflammatory stimuli, causing a
response when one would not otherwise occur, which is characterized by high levels of proinflammatory
mediators. There is a direct association between proinflammatory mediator levels and pain; fibroblasts taken
from sites of exquisite pain produce the highest levels of these mediators, indicating the vestibule could be
uniquely vulnerable and could be specifically targeted to resolve pain. We subsequently identified several
candidates for therapeutic intervention (e.g. Dectin-1, Nuclear kappa factor B). However, targeting these would
not completely alleviate proinflammatory signaling or might compromise host defenses. Our goal is to identify
and validate new therapeutic targets for LPV pain therapy. Our supporting data strongly suggest that transient
receptor potential vanilloid receptor 4 (TRPV4) and members of its signaling pathway represent promising and
innovative therapeutic targets. We will confirm TRPV4’s role in LPV, validate the likely therapeutic targets, and
in the process, enhance our mechanistic understanding of vulvodynia.
Organizing Hypothesis: We hypothesize that targeting the TRPV4 pathway will reduce pro-nociceptive
signaling in human fibroblasts and tissue and impart analgesia in mice
Specific Aim 1: Elucidate the role of site-specific TRPV4 signaling differences to identify new therapeutic
targets for LPV.
Specific Aim 2: Explore the relationship between inflammation, TRPV4, and alterations in lipid profiles in LPV
patients.
Specific Aim 3: Validate TRPV4 and other identified targets using 3D tissue culture and an in vivo LPV model.
Impact on the field: We plan to accomplish three goals: 1) identify and validate new targets for desperately
needed non-invasive and efficacious vulvodynia therapies, 2) improve understanding of the vulvodynia
mechanism, and 3) identify mechanisms likely conserved in other pain conditions by focusing on a ubiquitous
signaling pathway (TRPV4) suspected to play a role in pain syndromes, targeting of which would be unlikely to
result in adverse sequelae, including drug dependence disorders."

Walking automaticity, the ability of the nervous system to successfully coordinate movement with minimal use
of executive resources, is a critical functional skill for independent mobility in daily life, and may be improved by
medication and/or appropriate rehabilitation-based intervention. This ability is compromised, even in early
stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is responsible for major mobility disabilities and cognitive dysfunction
and a worse quality of life than most other chronic neurological diseases, and it imposes a heavy burden on
the health care system. Aim I will investigate the relation between cognitive function and walking automaticity
in subjects with PD and age-matched healthy control subjects by measuring brain activity in different parts of
the cerebral cortex while walking and turning. Levodopa, the most common pharmacological treatment in PD,
improves certain aspects of gait, but it may worsen or not change other aspects, such as balance. The effects
of levodopa on gait automaticity are not well understood. Aim II will characterize the changes in cortical activity
during walking due to usual levodopa intake in people with PD.
Cueing is often being used in rehabilitation. More recently, due to the increasingly user-friendly wireless
technology, personalized, closed-loop cueing devices are now being developed as an improvement over fixed
cueing methods (such us walking to the pace of a metronome or stepping over lines placed on the floor).
Recently, we showed that step-synchronized tactile feedback improved gait automaticity in PD; however, it is
not known which brain mechanisms are associated with learning of this tactile-feedback technique, nor if
benefits transfer to mobility during daily-living. Our objective is to investigate the effects of step-synchronized,
tactile cueing on gait automaticity measured in the laboratory; this is Aim III, a clinical trial. In addition, Aim III
will explore the feasibility of using the cueing system at home for one week.
This project will characterize the cortical correlates of gait automaticity, the changes in gait automaticity with
dopamine replacement and cueing in people with PD, and how these changes translate to improvement in gait
and turning. In

There are minima l risks associated with this technology and the benefits could be significant in
improving walking and reducing falls in various populations.Furthermore, by understanding more
about the brain mechanisms associated with walking automaticity and motor learning through cueing, we will

10837861,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy has advanced tremendously in the past decade and cellular products are now being leveraged
efficiently in a number of settings. Third party targeted therapeutic Immune Effector Cell (IEC) interventions are
bound to change the way we treat AML and ALL. NK cell products hold promise because of their ability to quickly
kill tumor cells without causing graft versus host disease (GVHD). Similarly, tolerance inducing regulatory T cells
(Tregs) are a T cell population with cytolytic as well as tolerance induction potential. Furthermore, in the
allogeneic setting, Tregs suppress GVHD and graft rejection. This grant focuses on clinical implementation of
novel Treg and NK targeted therapeutics in AML and ALL, as well as development of novel CAR-iTregs and
CAR-iNKs. An overarching hypothesis of this PPG is that allogeneic Treg and NK cell immunotherapies can be
engineered to maximize successful leukemia control with decreased toxicity, when compared to conventional T
cell immunotherapy approaches. To that end, Core C will provide seamless sample processing and state-of-the-
art assays to best inform the projects on how IEC cell interventions work in the clinic and help assess how novel
IEC products perform pre-clinically. The Core integrates the processing, storage/annotation, distribution, and
analytic capabilities of the Translational Therapy Laboratory, an NCI funded Cancer Center Support Grant
shared resource, with a number of novel techniques to gain deep understanding of Treg and NK cell biology, the
immune landscape influencing and resulting from IEC intervention, and the tumor microenvironment (TME) the
IEC cell interventions must operate in. Mass cytometry, CyTOF, will be used to phenotypically evaluate IEC
products and immune reconstitution at a high level of detail. CyTOF analysis of bone marrow samples will also
be leveraged to evaluate the TME. Cytolytic assays will be used to determine IEC function pre-clinically and after
patient treatment. Assays will be carried out equally across all projects to determine differences in
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of each of the products so they can be fairly compared to each
other and inform project leaders on how to best implement IEC interventions. Uniform, high-quality data
generated in these studies will be integrated with clinical outcomes, in collaboration with Cores A and B, and
will be made available to all of the projects in order to maximize synergy and limit variation generated by having
different laboratories carry out assays for individual projects."

Immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that engage a specific antigen and trigger immune
effector cell (IEC) activity has transformed cancer therapy. This application focuses on the development and
clinical implementation of engineered T-regulatory (Treg) and NK cells due to their potent tumoricidal activity
with no risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The central hypothesis of this P01 s that allogeneic IECs
(Tregs and NK cells) can be engineered to maximize tumor killing with fewer risks including undesirable on-
target/off-tumor adverse events. Toward achieving the goals of the three Projects, Core D will provide the
molecular tools and analytics crucial for optimizing the genetic engineering platforms and examining the cell
products to maximize safety prior to testing in the proposed clinical trials. In addition, Core D will provide umbilical
cord blood (UCB) Tregs and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived induced CD8+ Tregs (iPSC- iTreg) for
the studies outlined in Projects 1 and 2 in particular and Project 3 for comparative studies. The Core will perform
molecular analyses of gene edited cell products and cell lines as a quality control. The Core integrates leading
edge genetic constructs and proteins for engineering IECs with enhanced therapeutic properties as an off-the-
shelf product for widespread and urgent use. Core D will produce lentiviral and adeno-associated virus (AAV)
serotype 6 vectors that will be used to introduce/overexpress novel immune therapy genes in Treg, NK, and
iPSC to enhance tumor eradication. Luciferase lentiviruses will be used to generate cells that can be imaged in
vitro/vivo to track IECs or tumor killing over time in all three Projects. The clustered regularly interspaced
palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene editing platform allows for target gene disruption, user defined
modification (i.e., incorporation of novel exogenous sequences), and transcriptome modulation. CRISPR/Cas9
will be employed in each project for enhancing IEC activity through deletion of target genes, introduction of
immune therapy candidates into user defined genomic loci, and upregulation of specific gene(s) that regulate
immune responses. Core D will also serve as the hub for distributing nanobody proteins and cellular products
to the Project Leaders. Nanobodies that have high affinity to leukemia antigens will be provided to the project
and program leaders for application in IECs for the Projects’. This will inform project leaders as to how to best
implement or modify Treg and NK cell immunotherapeutic interventions. Uniform, high-quality reagents and data
generated in these studies will be integrated with clinical outcomes in collaboration with Cores A, B, and C, and

10863889,"Summary/Abstract
Recently a number of electronic cigarettes (EC) brands have claimed to use liquids that are
“tobacco-free”, meaning they contain “synthetic” nicotine. Such products are not currently subject
to existing FDA tobacco control regulations and might be marketed to youth and others as cleaner
and less harmful than EC that contain nicotine derived from tobacco. E-cigarette manufacturers
may use synthetic nicotine as a way to avoid ongoing FDA regulatory processes for ECs.
Nicotine is a chiral compound with one asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as two mirror image
forms termed enantiomers or optical isomers, the levorotatory (S)-isomer and the dextrorotatory
(R)-isomer. While nicotine from tobacco is almost exclusive (S)-nicotine, most synthetic nicotine
is comprised of racemic (S)- and (R)- nicotine. Animal studies indicate that (S)- nicotine is more
potent than (R)- nicotine for most pharmacological effects, but the relative potency for different
effects varies considerably. Animal data also find differences in rates and pathways of metabolism
of the two nicotine enantiomers. Very little information exists on the human pharmacology of R
nicotine or racemic nicotine. Understanding the relative abuse potential, cardiovascular effects
and metabolic differences of the nicotine enantiomers and their racemic mixture is important for
appropriate FDA regulation of synthetic nicotine products.
We propose to conduct a human clinical pharmacology study using stable isotope methodology
to compare pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vaped (S)- and (R)- nicotine and
racemic nicotine. We will synthesize and prepare for human administration deuterium labeled (S)-
and (R)- nicotine.
In a crossover study, experienced EC users will on three separate days vape (S)-, (R)- or racemic
nicotine both in standardized sessions (15 puffs, one every 30 sec) and in a 90 min ad libitum use
session. Outcome measures will include pharmacokinetics, pulmonary retention, patterns of
nicotine metabolism, subjective and cardiovascular responses, and nicotine self-administration.
Of particular interest will be how in racemic nicotine mixtures (as found in many synthetic nicotine
products), the presence of (R)- nicotine affects the pharmacology and self-administration of (S)-
nicotine."
10746004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K01 proposal, led by Dr. Phillip Hwang, PhD, MPH, examines the role of physical activity as a contributor
to cognitive resilience across the adult life course. Greater physical activity is associated with better cognitive
function and reduced risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Physical activity is thought
to exert its potential beneficial effects on the brain by promoting neural compensation, including changes to
structural and functional brain characteristics that support greater brain efficacy and capacity. Thus, physical
stimulation may be a key contributor to cognitive resilience, which is considered as the ability to withstand
greater ADRD risk levels and avoid cognitive impairment or have better-than-expected cognitive function.
A major gap in knowledge regarding physical activity as a potential resilience factor is whether the impact of
physical activity on resilience differs across the life course. Evidence is also lacking on specific aspects of
physical activity, such as frequency or type of activity, that correlate with cognitive resilience. To address
these knowledge gaps, this proposal will focus on physical activity in early adult life, midlife, and late-life and
evaluate their associations with cognitive resilience using sophisticated statistical- and machine learning-based
methods. Physical activity data collected from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), which has participants
enrolled across the lifespan and conducts dementia surveillance, including neuropsychological examinations,
will support this investigation. Additional multi-dimensional physical activity data from wearable devices will
come from the Integrated Digital Technology Platform for Optimization of Precision Brain Health project.
The research plan is complemented by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the Boston
University School of Medicine, which will provide a rich training environment that will foster Dr. Hwang’s
development into an independent researcher. The plan builds on the Dr. Hwang’s background in
neuroepidemiology and ADRD prevention research, and includes new training in the measurement of physical
activity, neuroimaging and cognitive assessments in relation to ADRD, and machine learning methods. The
combined research and training plans will prepare Dr. Hwang for a successful independent research career
focused on identifying modifiable lifestyle factors over the life course and designing multi-domain lifestyle
interventions to promote healthy brain aging and delay or possibly prevent the onset of ADRD.
This research aligns with the NIA’s Strategic Directions for Research, 2020-2025 key goals to identify the
behavioral, psychological, and neural mechanisms and processes that confer successful aging and resilience
to cognitive impairment. This research is urgently needed as the number of older adults is growing, which
means that the number of new cases of ADRD will increase as well, given that aging itself remains the most
significant risk factor for ADRD. Findings from this research will help provide knowledge that can serve as the

10770516,"Far Red Light to Improve Functioning in PAD: the LIGHT PAD Trial
 Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 10-15% of people age 65 and older and 15 to 20%
of those age 75 and older. Older people with PAD have greater functional impairment, faster functional
decline, and higher rates of mobility loss than people without PAD. In PAD, reduced perfusion of
gastrocnemius muscle is associated with increased gastrocnemius oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment,
and muscle fiber damage. Yet few non-invasive therapies improve functioning in people with PAD.
 Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule with therapeutic properties that improve perfusion and reverse the
skeletal muscle pathology in PAD. In preclinical studies, NO increases angiogenesis and perfusion, protects
against ischemic injury, enhances skeletal muscle mitochondrial activity, and activates satellite cells, which
restore and repair skeletal muscle. Interventions that increase NO bioavailability have major therapeutic
potential for people with PAD.
 Nitrosothiols are a major source of NO and NO bioactivity. Preclinical studies and our preliminary human
evidence show that far red light (at wavelength of 670 nm) releases nitrosothiols, nitrite, and other vasoactive
species. Four pilot studies completed in preparation for this proposal showed that a single dose of far red light
therapy increased plasma nitrosothiols, improved lower extremity blood flow, and meaningfully improved
functional performance in people with PAD.
 Therefore, we propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial to collect preliminary data to test whether four
months of daily far red light treatment of the lower extremities improves walking performance, lower extremity
perfusion, and ischemia-related gastrocnemius muscle damage in people with PAD, compared to a sham
control. Thirty- two people with PAD will be randomized to 10 minutes of daily home treatment with either far
red light or a sham light for four months. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk distance at 4-
month follow-up. In secondary and exploratory aims, we will distinguish between acute and chronic effects of
far red light on six-minute walk, measure the effects of far red light on treadmill walking performance and
patient-reported outcomes, and delineate biologic pathways by which far red light improves walking
performance in PAD, by measuring change in plasma nitrite and nitrosothiols, gastrocnemius muscle perfusion
(MRI arterial spin labeling) and gastrocnemius muscle health and mitochondrial activity (measured by muscle
biopsy). If our hypotheses are supported by this Phase II trial, results will be used to design a definitive
randomized trial of far red light for people with PAD. If far red light improves functional performance in PAD,
this simple, accessible, and well tolerated therapy will have a major impact on preventing mobility loss and
improving quality of life in the large and growing number of older people disabled by PAD."

Harnessing Age-Associated B Cells for a Universal Influenza Vaccine for the Aged. With age, the
generation of T follicular helpers from naive CD4 T cells, and germinal center B cells from follicular B cells, that
are both needed for the generation of high affinity antibody (Ab), become highly compromised. Most current
vaccines for influenza in the elderly are not effective at inducing these critical responses. Thus, the elderly,
though protected by Ab already in place for pathogens encountered earlier in life, are highly susceptible to new
strains of virus (e.g. influenza) and newly emerged pathogens (e.g. pandemic influenzas, COVID-19). We
described the generation of an unusual population of Ab-secreting B cells that developed to live influenza
infection in aged mice. We found they were derived from stimulation of recently described ""age-associated B
cells"" (ABC) of a naïve sIgD+ phenotype. In the aged, these influenza-induced ABC (iABC) are generated
independently of CD4 T cell help, but strictly depend on stimulation by pathogen-associated ""danger"" signals
and thus they are generated well in aged infected mice. Notably, ABC are the predominant naïve B cells that
respond in aged mice.
Here we will determine the potential of IgD ABC to respond to influenza infection and generate Ab-secreting cells
(AbSC) effector iABC that are either recirculating or are tissue resident. We will determine if they give rise to B
cell memory, both resting memory and long-lived Ab-secreting cells, and if these are found in the lower
respiratory tract (lung) and upper respiratory tract (URT):nasal tissues and nasal associated lymphoid tissue-
NALT), as well as the spleen and BM. We will determine the contribution of ABC-derived effector and memory
subsets and the Ab they produce in these the different sites to protection from reinfection. We will ask how long-
lived are the memory cells in distinct sites. We will compare the ability of live influenza virus, whole inactivated
virus, and mRNA-LNP HA vaccine to generate the recirculating and tissue resident effector and memory subsets
and to induce protective immunity. These results will give us new insights into this novel age-associated immune
pathway and give us important new insights into whether harnessing the aged ABC response can provide
superior protection in the aged. It will provide indications of what general vaccine strategies are likely to be
needed to immunize the ABC in the elderly. These findings could lead to a more Universal vaccines that can
provide robust protection to the elderly, who are currently highly vulnerable."
10763433,"The proposed studies are relevant to the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of
preventable blindness in children. An important trigger for ROP development is the exposure of premature infants
to oxygen after birth. This delays normal retinal vascular growth, still taking place in the premature retina. When
the infant is brought back to room air, this leads to tissue ischemia, abnormal retinal neovascularization, and,
possibly, retinal detachment and blindness. Available interventions are applied in the most advanced stages of
the disease and consist of ablation of retinal neovascular tufts or intravitreal injections of anti-angiogenic factors
(i.e., VEGF). All these procedures and treatments are associated with severe side effects, including significant
loss of visual field and late recurrences. We have recently found that agonists of the nuclear receptor
farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) exert protective effects in an experimental model of ROP (oxygen-induced
retinopathy; OIR). Interestingly, we have also found that FXR expression and levels of FXR endogenous ligands
are downregulated in OIR, further supporting the hypothesis that leveraging/restoring FXR-dependent signaling
could exert key protective effects in ROP/OIR. To confirm this, we found that FXR is present in retinal astrocytes
and endothelial cells that are primarily affected in OIR. FXR stimulation may elicit anti-apoptotic responses in
astrocytes and anti-angiogenic effects in retinal endothelial cells, thus targeting two key events involved in the
induction and progression of OIR. Our working hypothesis is that alterations in retinal FXR signaling play a key
role in ROP pathogenesis and the pharmacological modulation of these pathways represents a new therapeutic
tool in limiting ROP pathology. We have designed experiments to be conducted in vivo, using the OIR model
and in vitro experimental settings to 1) investigate the effects of modulating FXR receptor signaling in OIR; 2)
investigate FXR signaling in retinal astrocytes and endothelial cells in OIR. The potential outcomes of the
proposed studies could fill the need for new and better therapies for ROP."
10896916,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In sub-Saharan Africa, heart failure (HF), a clinical syndrome that causes multiple debilitating symptoms and
results in poor health-related quality of life, has a 34% 1-year mortality rate, the highest of any region globally.
Major care gaps and sociodemographic disparities exist throughout the continuum of HF care. Self-care is an
evidence-based intervention that can improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in HF and is widely
endorsed by international bodies. Self-care holds particular promise in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)
because it shifts fundamental care tasks from providers and facilities to patients while empowering patients to
better care for themselves. However, self-care is underutilized in LMIC where providers lack knowledge, tools,
and time to support patients in self-care and where inequities in self-care implementation among patients and
providers are not well known. The overarching goal of our work is to improve HF care in LMIC. In this Type 2
hybrid study, we will implement a digital-first strategy (Medly Uganda) to improve self-care in HF at 6 Ugandan
Regional Referral Hospital outpatient departments and evaluate both implementation and clinical outcomes. All
study aims are guided by the RE-AIM framework and PRISM extension, involve mixed methods, and are
designed to prioritize health equity. First, we will assess the implementation and clinical effectiveness of Medly
Uganda to improve HF self-care in Uganda (Aim 1). To do this, we will conduct a stepped-wedge, cluster
randomized trial that includes a control period followed by a basic evidence-based package to support HF care,
followed by Medly Uganda. The co-primary outcomes will be the Self-Care of HF Index (implementation) and the
composite of mortality and HF hospitalization (clinical effectiveness). In parallel to this, we will conduct a mixed
methods process evaluation to inform iterative adjustments to the implementation processes (Sub-Aim 1.1) using
a community-engaged approach to systematically collect qualitative and quantitative process data at pre-
determined time points based on the Learn-As-You-Go design and make contextually appropriate
implementation adaptations. Next, we will evaluate the implementation fidelity and context of Medly Uganda with
a focus on reach, adoption, and maintenance (Aim 2) using a deviance approach based on Medly Uganda meta
data from patients and providers, focusing on how social determinants might shape equity in implementation.
We will also explore patient and provider impacts beyond HF, such as mental health and healthcare autonomy.
Then, we will explore cost, cost effectiveness, and sustainability factors for Medly Uganda (Aim 3), including an
examination of cost, cost-effectiveness, and equity of Medly Uganda from a financial and societal perspective
(Sub-Aim 3.1) and an exploration of patient and provider perspectives on the sustainability of Medly Uganda
(Sub-Aim 3.2). This study will generate important insights to support implementation of innovative, locally
relevant strategies to improve HF care in LMIC and aligns with NHLBI's Center for Translation Research and
Implementation Science priorities."

10748387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The maintenance of genomic integrity during sperm and egg development is fundamental for fertility and
proper genome inheritance across generations. Germ cells require precise regulation of gene expression to
silence deleterious genomic elements, such as transposons, which can cause DNA damage and heritable
mutations associated with both infertility and birth defects. During spermatocyte and oocyte development, the
conserved PIWI/piRNA small RNA pathway monitors and protects the germ cell genome by repressing gene
expression of these deleterious elements. Recent published work from the Libuda lab demonstrates that heat
shock produces elevated DNA damage associated with transposon activity in Caenorhabditis elegans
spermatocytes, concurrent with reduced fertility in males. Preliminary data suggest a role for the PIWI/piRNA
pathway in the production of heat-induced DNA damage specifically in spermatocytes, potentially via impaired
regulation of transposon activity. Additional data quantifying the deposition of the repressive chromatin mark
H3K9me3 indicates that females produce a robust gene-repressive response to acute heat-stress which is
lacking in males. With this research, I will test the hypothesis that sexually dimorphic piRNA pathway
responses to heat stress regulate the production of heat-induced DNA damage, associated with
transposon activity, in spermatocytes and oocytes. The research proposed herein will define the precise
role of altered piRNA pathway function and subsequent transposon de-repression in the production of heat-
induced DNA damage in developing sperm and eggs. In Aim 1 I will use small RNA sequencing in conjunction
with H3K9me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to define sex cell-specific differences in piRNA-
directed gene targeting and H3K9me3 induced silencing respectively. In this way I will identify gamete-specific
differences in piRNA pathway-mediated gene silencing in response to heat. In Aim 2 I will follow up on my
finding that loss of PRG-1, the piRNA pathway master regulator which interacts with piRNAs in the germline to
suppress transposons, enhances the production of heat-stress induced DNA damage in spermatocytes. I will
use immunofluorescence microscopy and a conditional knockdown for PRG-1 to quantify the production of
heat-induced DNA damage and H3K9me3 abundance and localization in spermatocytes and oocytes with and
without PRG-1. Further, to better define this link between PRG-1 loss, its impact on chromatin state, and gene
expression I will use qPCR to quantify DNA transposon expression in spermatocytes and oocytes with and
without PRG-1, as well as with and without heat shock. These studies will provide critical insight into
fundamental differences between the oogenic and spermatogenic developmental programs, benefiting our
understanding of sexual dimorphism in the maintenance of genomic integrity, as well as shedding light on
broader mechanisms underlying the development of heat-sensitive infertility."
10783805,"Extensive use of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) has led to glyphosate entering the food chain, and
causing human sera and urine levels to increase over time. This exposure has led to numerous claims that
glyphosate causes diseases ranging from multiple types of cancer to affecting human development and
reproduction. However, no mechanism of glyphosate import into human cells is known; in yeast, importation
occurs through the glutamate/ aspartate (D/E) transporters due to its structural resemblance. Glyphosate is
thought not to have acute effects on humans because they lack the shikimate pathway that produces aromatic
amino acids (WYF), which is inhibited in the presence of glyphosate, and humans instead acquire aromatic
amino acids through diet or the gut microbiome. The differences in commercial preparations of glyphosate
have complicated the studies because GBHs have surfactants that increase tissue penetration. Yeast can
bypass the inhibition of the shikimate pathway when supplemented with (WYF), which permits the assessment
of the role of surfactants or, more likely, discover the unknown glyphosate targets. Our initial studies have
found that genes regulating mitochondria, DNA damage, and the cell cycle are differentially regulated in GBH
treatments. The long-term goal is to identify the glyphosate transportation mechanisms into cells, the brain,
and other tissues that affect mitochondrial metabolism. This application's objective is to determine how
mitochondrial metabolism is affected by glyphosate alone and in commercial formulations in the model
organism S. cerevisiae. Our central hypothesis is that the transport of glyphosate is due to mimicry of
glutamate and aspartate; thus, it will affect other enzymes that utilize glutamate and aspartate, especially
within the mitochondria. The rationale of this proposal is that mitochondrial effects of glyphosate have a
biochemical basis and will provide a mechanistic understanding of cellular effects in vertebrate species.
Specific aims proposed are 1. Measure the import of glyphosate into different compartments in different
mutants and how adding D/E rescues growth inhibition from glyphosate 2. Measure changes in specific
mitochondrial metabolites (ATP and NADH) in glyphosate treated cells. The proposed research is innovative
because the hypothesis proposed is using unbiased experiments, such as genome-wide association,
transcriptomics, and In-Lab Evolution experiments to determine the mechanism of extra- and intracellular
glyphosate transport using D/E transporters. Glyphosate mimics D/E amino acids in transport, so it likely
affects other enzymes that use D/E, particularly in the mitochondria. In plants, fungi, and bacteria, D/E
transporters have all been implicated in glyphosate transport and glyphosate affecting mitochondrial functions.
While humans do not have the shikimate pathway, they have D/E transporters, and conserved mitochondrial
proteins that use D/E, which may be the off-targets of glyphosate leading to the range of diseases claimed to
have been caused by glyphosate."
10766241,"ABSTRACT
Intermittent fasting and caloric restriction are effective therapies against insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Yet, intensive lifestyle modifications are rarely
sustainable. We made the provocative discovery that modulating systemic arginine status is sufficient to mimic
the therapeutic effects of generalized caloric restriction on hepatic steatosis. This is clinically significant,
because targeting arginine is a tractable pathway through which to treat metabolic disease. Accordingly, our
long-term goal is to define the signaling cascades underlying adaptive hepatic glucose fasting, so that we can
identify new therapies that leverage these pathways against NAFLD and NASH. Our unbiased transcriptomic
screening in fasting mice identified a novel glucose fasting-induced effector: the amino acid hydrolase, arginase
2 (Arg2). Our new data demonstrate that forced hepatocyte-specific Arg2 expression reduces peripheral insulin
resistance, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation in diabetic mice. Because hepatocyte arginine fate depends upon
competition between Arg2 and the lysosomal arginine sensing machinery that dictate autophagic flux, and the
pro-inflammatory enzyme, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), we hypothesize that fasting-induced
hepatocyte Arg2 attenuates hepatic steatosis and inflammation by depleting hepatocyte arginine. To test this,
we will: 1) examine pleiotropic therapeutic mechanisms of Arg2 action against insulin resistance and hepatic
inflammation; 2) examine small-molecule and advanced biological therapeutics that mimic the therapeutic
actions of Arg2 activation and 3) define their mechanistic underpinnings. Completing these aims will: 1) establish
arginine status as a determinant of metabolic homeostasis; 2) identify how modulating arginase activity impacts
cellular lysosomal sensing and its physiological outcomes; and 3) examine efficacy and mechanisms of novel
therapies to NAFLD, NASH and insulin resistance."
10805507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For more than two decades through local and multi-center studies our team at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital has
documented the epidemiology of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the US and its associated early-onset co-
morbidities and complications. Furthermore, recent studies show current therapies do not slow or prevent the
progression of youth-onset T2D once it has started, highlighting the aggressive nature of this condition and the
critical need for prevention. Unfortunately, studies to date have failed to yield a sufficient number of youths who
have developed T2D, limiting the ability to define who is at risk and the underlying pathophysiology. As such, we
have developed a prospective, longitudinal observational cohort study along with a series of hypothesis driven
investigations to uncover the pathophysiology leading to youth-onset T2D directly addressing the overarching
objective of this U01 funding opportunity. We propose to recruit a cohort of youth, selected for risk factors
associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. This cohort will undergo detailed studies of pancreatic beta
(β) cell function that include measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion. These studies will be coupled with
assessment of genetics, adiposity, metabolic factors, behavioral and psychosocial risks to elucidate how these
factors influence β-cell function and progression to T2D. Monitoring the proportion of youth in the cohort who
develop T2D and the frequency of associated co-morbidities will fulfill Aim 1, while assessing β-cell function
during puberty and the genetic, metabolic and hormonal factors associated with β-cell function will complete Aim
2. Aim 3, will be achieved by evaluating the role of behavioral and psychosocial factors on β-cell function and
progression to T2D. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital has longstanding, proven clinical and research expertise in
pediatric obesity and youth-onset type 2 diabetes and experience performing complex studies of pancreatic β-
cell function including frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing, clamp studies, and oral glucose
tolerance testing. Our site also has high patient volumes of race/ethnicity, urban/rural, and socioeconomic
diverse clinical cohorts with documented ability to recruit and retain participants in our prior NIH funded studies,
and we have successfully collaborated in many pediatric multicenter studies. Thus, we are well positioned to
partner in this U01 consortium to advance our understanding of the pathophysiology to youth-onset T2D. This
proposal will refine the phenotype of youth at greatest risk for T2D and identify factors that influence β-cell
function and the progression to T2D. This will position the consortium to develop targeted interventions to prevent
youth-onset T2D as a next step."

bifunctional molecules that work with catalytically inactive dCas9 to recruit endogenous
chromatin regulatory enzymes to any site across the mammalian genome. Three main
goals of this research program are: 1. Explore how heterochromatin gene repression is
governed by two distinct H3K9 methylation binding proteins, 2. Develop approaches to
visualize dynamic heterochromatin gene repression in real time at the single cell level 3.
Study chromatin dynamics in real time with bifunctional compounds to recruit endogenous
enzymes to specific loci. Over the course of this grant our research group will continue to
advance our understanding of the mechanisms of heterochromatin gene repression using
unique chemically based technologies. We also will further advance areas we have
pioneered developing bifunctional small molecules to explore the capture and retargeting

10754911,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is essential for memory formation and spatial navigation. In the classic hippocampal
trisynaptic circuit (entorhinal cortex→dentate gyrus→CA3→CA1), dentate gyrus and CA1 act as the primary
input and output areas, respectively, that connect the hippocampus with the brain areas outside of the
hippocampus. By contrast, CA3 is often viewed as an auto-associative network vital for contextual learning via
its intra-hippocampal connections. While CA3’s intra-hippocampal inputs and outputs, including mossy fibers
from dentate gyrus, recurrent collaterals from CA3, and Schaffer collaterals to CA1 have been extensively
studied, the connections between CA3 and other subcortical areas remain largely unexplored. This proposal
aims to fill this critical gap of knowledge by investigating the functional connectivity and behavioral roles of
subcortical-to-CA3 inputs. Our preliminary experiments revealed that two subcortical areas outside of the
hippocampus – basolateral amygdala and supramammillary nucleus in the hypothalamus – excite and inhibit
CA3 pyramidal neuron activity, respectively. We will, therefore, test a central hypothesis that basolateral
amygdala and supramammillary nucleus promote and suppress contextual fear learning by enhancing and
suppressing the activity of CA3 pyramidal neurons, respectively. In Aims 1 and 2, we will determine whether a
selective population of neurons in basolateral amygdala and supramammillary nucleus excite and inhibit CA3
pyramidal neuron activity in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of basolateral
amygdala-CA3 and supramammillary nucleus-CA3 inputs in contextual fear memory. The proposed studies
represent a significant shift of focus from traditional research on CA3’s intra-hippocampal connectivity to its
extra-hippocampal connectivity. Furthermore, as impairments of CA3, basolateral amygdala, and
supramammillary nucleus are strongly associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders, including
posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD), depression, chronic stress and epilepsy, this proposal will provide a
valuable knowledge base for future studies to explore the role of these three interconnected regions in disease."
10895270,"One in eight couples are impacted by infertility, defined as difficulty obtaining or sustaining a pregnancy
after one year of unprotected intercourse, and many couples turn to costly assisted reproductive technologies
such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). Even with genetic screening of embryos for chromosomal abnormalities, up to
40% of embryo transfers are still unsuccessful. The lack of comprehensive mucosal systems-level data with well
described implantation and both female and male fertility endpoints in the context of IVF has limited our
understanding of potential microbiome, immune and intra-partner interactions that may contribute to infertility
and treatment success, which has limited therapeutic options. Therefore, identifying host-microbial interactions
in both female and male partners and potential intra-couple signatures of infertility could lead to novel therapeutic
targets or predictive models to increase clinical pregnancy rates, which would be a significant advance.
 Our global hypothesis is that dysbiotic ecology and function of urogenital microbiomes drive host
inflammatory processes that contribute to female and male factor infertility. In this proposal we will
investigate the microbiome and immune drivers of male and female infertility by utilizing a partnered cohort with
well-defined infertility and pregnancy endpoints to characterize the endometrial, cervicovaginal, seminal and
penile factors contributing to IVF success. We will collect endometrial and cervicovaginal samples from the
female partner during an endometrial receptivity assay (ERA) cycle which mimics the hormonal conditions
present during subsequent embryo transfer cycles. A unique feature of this cohort is targeted enrollment of
couples with either female or male fertility issues, providing the ability to assess fertility interactions at a per
couple level. We will utilize a state-of-the-art systems biology approach including high dimensional flow cytometry
with computational analysis, single cell RNA sequencing, metaproteomics, metabolomics, and host cellular
analysis coupled with advanced multivariate modeling techniques to determine the effect of the female and
male genital microenvironment on fertility, with the characterization female, male, and both intra- and inter-
couple signatures that underlie decreased fertility. In this proposal we aim to determine the effect of the female
genital microenvironment (inflammation and microbiome) on implantation success, the seminal
microenvironment on semen quality and male factor infertility, and to characterize the inter-couple signatures
between female and male partner microenvironment that underlie combined decreased fertility.
 These studies will identify host and microbial factors associated with infertility and help understand both
intra-individual and inter-partner interactions that could contribute to fertility outcomes, which could identify novel
therapeutic strategies or predictive models to increase clinical pregnancy rates."
10782973,".PROJECT SUMMARY.
Rehabilitation research is critical to health, particularly for our aging populations and those with disability, but
the field of rehabilitation research remains underdeveloped relative to other areas of biomedical research.
Conducting the studies that are needed to innovate rehabilitation care for the large and growing population of
older adults and persons with disability requires rehabilitation scientists with the skills needed to successfully
compete for extramural funding and manage their funded proposals. In addition, advancements in rehabilitation
research requires peer-reviewers who are able to provide critical review of rehabilitation research funding
applications. In this renewal application, we propose continuation and further development of Intensive
Rehabilitation Research Grant Writing Workshops in the United States more commonly known as TIGRR
(Training in Grantsmanship in Rehabilitation Research). This year-long (12-month) research education
program engages early stage investigators (ESI) in one-on-one expert mentorship in grantsmanship, grants
management, career development, and development of peer-review skills for rehabilitation research. The need
for this immersive research training program arises from the reality that practice in rehabilitation specialties is
often based on expert opinion, prior experience, and tradition rather than on scientifically derived evidence.
There is a need to develop and test interventions and devices that have a sound scientific basis – but this
requires a workforce of professionals who are well-prepared to compete for extramural funding. While, for most
areas of biomedical research, training begins in the post-baccalaureate and postdoctoral years, many
investigators in rehabilitation research begin their careers as clinicians. These clinical experiences provide
them with essential insights about potentially beneficial rehabilitation approaches, but they often lack exposure
to intensive grantwriting opportunities and the preparation to be successful following a grant award. The
TIGRR program is intended to address this need through a 12-month research education experience that
includes a week-long workshop as its nucleus. Unlike most grantwriting courses that are completely didactic,
TIGRR mentees are assigned a primary and secondary mentor who provide detailed, iterative critiquing of their
proposals, and they participate in intensive one-on-one mentorship prior to and following the workshop. In the
workshop, mentees meet with multiple mentors who reflect a wide range of expertise and perspectives, and
are immersed in the development of their proposal. Following the workshop, they continue to meet with their
primary mentor, and also apply knowledge gained through NIH-style peer-review panels wherein they have the
opportunity to have their applications reviewed, develop their critical evaluation skills through peer-review, and
receive mentor feedback on their reviews. Through TIGRR, we will develop a workforce of well-trained,
rehabilitation researchers whose expertise will foster better rehabilitation research. Importantly, we also work to

10810641,"Oklahoma suffers from substantial health disparities, and is ranked in the bottom 5 states in numerous categories
related to overall health and education. One solution to this problem is to increase the population's scientific
literacy, which will improve how individuals approach life choices involving health consequences. Oklahoma has
28 undergraduate institutions that offer 4-year degrees. Although readily accessible, the number of citizens who
earn a Bachelor's degree (25.2%) is low compared to the United States average (31.5%). One way to address
this is to train a more diverse cohort of scientists who can advocate for science in all communities. Importantly,
many of the PhD recipients in Oklahoma elect to stay in the state for their careers, often assuming teaching
positions in the numerous undergraduate institutions. One impediment to increasing both numbers and diversity
in Oklahoma's doctoral programs is a lack of undergraduate biomedical research opportunities in its colleges
and universities. Research experience has become the single most important criterion for admission into
doctoral programs at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), which offers one of the only
biomedical doctoral programs in the state. For the past 5 years, these biomedical doctoral programs have
admitted 24 students per year, primarily through the Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences (GPiBS), the
first-year umbrella program that serves the 7 basic science degree-granting programs. Since inception, only 8%
of GPiBS admits have identified themselves as part of an under-represented group. More recently, this has
greatly improved, and URM numbers are approaching the 25% represented across the state. The Post-
Baccalaureate Research and Education Program (PREP), which will recruit students from primarily
underrepresented groups from regional colleges and universities, will help build on this success. The PREP will
be a one-year, research-intensive program at OUHSC. The curriculum will include formal courses on
experimental design and biostatistics, animal care and use, research methods, a combination lecture/journal
club course, and career development workshops. Training in the responsible conduct of research and in data
analysis and reproducibility will also be emphasized. Most of the students' time will be devoted to mentored
research in labs that are currently funded extramurally. Students will conduct two lab rotations, followed by a 9-
month experience in a selected lab. Students will have committees that monitor their progress, and will be
prepared for the graduate application and interview process. Students will be recruited directly into the PREP
through in-person visits to regional colleges and universities, through social media and websites, and through
the GPiBS application and interview process."
10783694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Macrophages (MF) are one of the largest immune cell components of tumor lesions, where their numbers
can even exceed cancer cells. MF play a key role in shaping the composition of the tumor microenvironment
(TME), the modulation of tumor innate and adaptive immunity, and the response to cancer immunotherapy.
Because of their critical roles, MF are an important target for cancer treatment. However, modulating tumor-
associated MF has proved extremely difficult. This is in large part because we still do not have a complete
understanding of the tumor MF compartment. In order to develop ways to modulate tumor MF and promote
cancer immunity, it is vital we gain a deeper understanding of the molecular and functional diversity of MF in
their tissue context.
 Using mass cytometry (CyTOF) and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), we initiated deep characterization of
the immune composition of early human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). We uncovered evidence of
multiple distinct MF populations enriched in human tumors. Notably, related MF clusters were also identified in
mice lung cancer lesions. Using fate mapping and scRNA-seq, we discovered these discrete MF populations
differ in developmental origin and have a distinct distribution in the TME. When the different subsets of MF were
depleted, tumor growth was impaired, but the alterations in TME differed, suggesting distinct mechanisms of
activity. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the unique subsets of MF have differential molecular states
and mediate differential contributions to tumor growth, organization, immunity, and response to PD1 blockade.
To address our hypothesis, we will: (1) comprehensively map the MF compartment of human lung tumors, at the
single cell level and with spatial resolution, at baseline and during treatment with PD1 blockade, in NSCLC
patients enrolled in a neoadjuvant immunotherapy clinical trial, (2) assess the functional contribution of distinct
MF subsets to tumor tissue remodeling and immune cell dynamics in the TME, and (3) determine the contribution
of distinct MF subsets to lung tumor immunity. We will also (4) investigate the function and activity of a specific
cell surface receptor, Trem2, which we found to be exclusively expressed on monocyte-derived MF in both
human and mouse lung tumors, and whose knockout impaired lung tumor growth similar to MF depletion;
suggesting an important and potentially targetable molecule in MF control of tumor growth.
 The outcome of these studies will (i) uncover the molecular and functional diversity of the MF compartment
of human lung tumors, (ii) determine how distinct MF subsets, and MF-specific genes, influence tumor growth,
the TME state, and tumor immunity, and (iii) provide insight into to how MF subsets influence, and are influenced
by, PD1 blockade in human NSCLC. These studies have the potential to help us understand some of the factors
that contribute to tumor response and resistance to immune editing, and aid in the further development and
clinical use of cancer immunotherapy strategies."

Candidate: The goal of this K01 Award is to support the training and research of Dr. Cassondra Marshall,
who's long-term goal is to advance reproductive and maternal health equity through the translation of evidence
into practice using tailored interventions that address the needs of racial/ethnic minority women with chronic
medical conditions. Her research has examined young women's contraceptive decision-making and has
explored the ways in which health care providers and systems can deliver patient-centered contraceptive care.
Research Plan: Women with diabetes prior to pregnancy have elevated rates of maternal and neonatal
morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes is increasingly prevalent among women during their childbearing
years, disproportionately impacting Black and Latina women. To prevent maternal and infant health
complications, there is an urgent need for enhanced efforts to improve reproductive health outcomes among
reproductive-aged women with type 2 diabetes, particularly racial/ethnic minorities. However, there are
currently no evidence-based strategies to implement clinical guidelines for improving reproductive outcomes
among adult women with type 2 diabetes. Patient decision support tools in primary care represent a promising
implementation strategy. The research aims are: Aim 1: Elucidate reproductive decision-making processes and
reproductive health care preferences among Black and Latina women of reproductive age with type 2 diabetes,
using person-centered and structural competency frameworks. Aim 2: Adapt an existing patient decision
support intervention to support reproductive decision-making and reproductive health counseling delivery in
primary care to meet the needs of Black and Latina reproductive-aged women with type 2 diabetes. Aim 3:
Assess acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention among patients and providers and examine the
implementation context for the intervention. Career Development and Training Plan: The candidate's training
plan capitalizes on an interdisciplinary mentoring team with expertise in person-centered family planning care,
diabetes care, implementation science, and organizational research in primary care. Through coursework,
workshops, apprenticeships, and mentored research experiences, Dr. Marshall will receive training in Person-
Centered and Structurally Competent Reproductive Health Interventions, Advanced Mixed Methods,
Implementation Science and Stakeholder Engagement, and Designing and Implementing Trials in the Primary
Care Setting. UC Berkeley and close partners UCSF and Kaiser Permanente Northern California provide an
excellent research infrastructure and training environment for Dr. Marshall. Summary: The training and
research proposed in this application position Dr. Marshall to be competitive for R01 funding to support a
multisite effectiveness-implementation trial of the adapted intervention and facilitate her transition to
independence as a researcher."
10756084,"A discrete group of neurons located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that express the transcription factor,
Phox2b provide a crucial excitatory drive to regulate downstream respiratory rhythm/pattern-generating circuits. The activity of these neurons is modulated by changes in CO2 (or its proxy, H+) and various other sensory
and arousal-state inputs to control breathing; their dysfunction is implicated in various central disorders of
breathing (e.g., sudden infant death, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)). The molecular and
cellular mechanisms involved in CO2/H+ sensing by RTN neurons, and how those are established developmentally and adapted to pathological conditions, remain matters of continuing scrutiny. In two Aims, we address a
receptor-mediated mechanism of pH sensitivity, and explore gene expression patterns that support developmental and adaptive RTN function. In Aim 1, we use new mouse genetic models to identify mechanisms of pH sensitivity in RTN neurons that are mediated by proton-activated GPR4 modulation of a background K+ channel,
exploring the hypothesis that GPR4 is expressed in RTN neurons, where its intrinsic pH sensitivity leads to
inhibition of KNa1.1 (encoded by Kcnt1) to contribute to CO2 stimulation of breathing and arousal. We propose
to: [1.1] Test whether direct detection of protons by GPR4 accounts for its effects on RTN neuronal sensitivity
and CO2-stimulated breathing; [1.2] Test whether KNa1.1 (Slo2.2, Kcnt1) is a GPR4-inhibited K+ channel effector
in RTN neurons; and [1.3] Define sites of GPR4 protein expression. In Aim 2, we combine single cell RNA-Seq
with gene manipulation and developmental/physiological challenges to test the hypothesis that Phox2b expression dictates a distinct molecular signature that supports critical physiological functions of RTN neurons, and
that those gene expression patterns are malleable to developmental and physiological challenges in support of
breathing. We propose to: [2.1] Determine consequences of Phox2b depletion on the RTN neuron transcriptome;
[2.2] Determine effect of birth on RTN neuron transcriptome; and [2.3] Characterize developmental and adaptive gene regulation in RTN neurons. To accomplish these aims, we employ a variety of techniques at multiple
levels of analysis. Specifically, we combine genetic and viral approaches for RTN neuron-specific manipulation
of gene expression; perform electrophysiological and functional/behavioral studies at the cellular and organismal levels; and utilize molecular neuroanatomy and single neuron genetic analyses for phenotypic characterization and quantification of normal and adaptive gene expression profiles.
 Collectively, the proposed studies will provide novel information regarding molecular and cellular mechanisms
that regulate the pH-dependent activity of RTN neurons, at critical periods during development and in response
to physiological challenge, with relevance for identifying new therapeutic targets for disorders of breathing."
10758954,"SUMMARY
Rett syndrome (RTT) (OMIM #312750) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations
in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Although RTT patients suffer from many co-morbid phenotypes,
wake disordered breathing has a major negative impact quality of life and is associated with high mortality rate
in this patient population. Evidence from murine models of RTT suggest disordered breathing results in part
from a disrupted ability to regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO2/H+ (i.e., central
chemoreflex). The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is a critical chemosensitive brainstem nucleus, contains
CO2/H+-sensitive neurons and astrocytes that together produce a CO2/H+-dependent drive to breath. Previous
and preliminary data identify heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels as key determinants of RTN astrocyte CO2/H+
chemosensitivity. However, homomeric Kir4.1 and heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 are differentially CO2/H+ sensitive
and regulate divergent astrocyte processes including membrane potential and clearance of neuronally
released extracellular K+, and it is not clear which of these mechanisms contributes to RTN chemoreception
and disordered breathing in RTT. Our previous work showed that MeCP2 deficient mice have reduced levels
of Kir4.1 and 5.1 channels, diminished astrocytic Kir4.1/5.1-like currents, dysregulated extracellular K+. MeCP2
deficient mice also show a blunted ventilatory response to CO2. Similarly, preliminary results show that global
deletion of astrocyte Kir4.1 channels also blunts the ventilatory response to CO2. Importantly targeted
(re)expression of Kir4.1 specifically in RTN astrocytes rescued disordered breathing in both Kir4.1 cKO and
MeCP2 deficient mice. Preliminary data also show that RTN astrocytes from Kir5.1 KO animals lack CO2/H+
sensitivity, thus suggesting heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels regulate RTN astrocyte chemosensitivity.
Recent ultrastructural studies indicate reduced astrocytic coverage of neuronal elements during sleep together
with increased extracellular space; thus necessitating state-dependent changes in astrocyte ion and transmitter
homeostasis, that may account for a reduced ventilatory response to CO2 during sleep. Consistent with this,
preliminary results show that RTN astrocytes undergo a ~25% volume increase in the wake state as compared
to sleep. Based on this, we hypothesize that Kir4.1/5.1 deficiency and compromised astrocyte
chemoreception are responsible for state-dependent disordered breathing in RTT. In this proposal, we
use an established mouse model of RTT, an inducible astrocyte specific Kir4.1 knockout mouse in conjunction
with astrocyte targeted AAV, astrocyte volume and morphological complexity measurements, slice
electrophysiology, and whole-animal plethysmography to explore the sleep-wake state-dependent
contributions of Kir4.1/5.1 channels to RTN chemoreception and respiratory activity in RTT. Understanding
how Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 contribute to RTN chemoreception across sleep-wake states and disordered breathing
may provide mechanistic insight for targeted treatment of disordered breathing in RTT."
10763363,"Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of the primary sensory neurons and spinal cord
interneuronal circuits that respond to and transmit pain and itch-provoking stimuli, how these stimuli are
interpreted by the brain to produce the perceptions of pain and itch are still unclear. To a great extent, this gap
in our knowledge reflects the much more limited information that we have about the projection neurons that
carry the information from the spinal cord to the brain. That gap is critical as it is the signals carried by the
projection neurons that are “read” by the brain and that ultimately lead to a perception of pain or itch, and to
their various submodalities (heat, cold, mechanical, etc.). Our research program is multidisciplinary, using
novel viral, genetic and functional (electrophysiological, behavioral and imaging) approaches to characterize
the properties of the projection neurons, the circuits that engage them, their supraspinal targets and the
functional consequence of their activity. An important focus of the research program is on the question of
convergence or segregation of the circuits that respond to painful or itch-provoking stimuli and the extent to
which these circuits are altered in the setting of injury. Our program includes several highly innovative
experiments that for the first time will not only determine the molecular heterogeneity of the projection neurons,
but will also examine the responses of populations of neurons in the brain to activity in the projection neurons.
Defining molecular subtypes of projection neurons and the development of Cre-expressing mice based on
these molecular features will permit a host of experiments, including viral-based retrograde (rabies) and
anterograde (HSV) tracing of circuits that influence subsets of projection neurons, as well as the behavioral
consequence of selective ablation, or DREADD-mediated activation/inhibition of these neurons. Finally, using
incredibly powerful Ca2+ imaging techniques that signal the activity of populations of neurons in awake, freely
moving mice, we will obtain new information on the behavioral correlates of algogen and pruritogen-evoked
supraspinal activity. Using novel behavioral paradigms our program will also provide important insights into the
processes through which noxious, and even innocuous stimuli (in the setting of injury), are interpreted as
painful. These new approaches will provide information about the quality of the pain that the animal
experiences and also offer a powerful validation of the mouse models of chronic pain and itch and their
translatability to the human condition.

10758855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Protein Kinase Novel (PKNs) family of kinases, also known as Protein Kinase C-related kinases, belong to
the PKC superfamily. A single nucleotide polymorphism at the Pkn2 locus is associated with greater risk for
coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction, and elevated levels of PKN2 protein are associated with heart
disease, highlighting the importance of PKN2 in heart. Global deletion of Pkn2 in mouse results in lethality at
embryonic day (E) 10 with cardiac defects. Conditional deletion of Pkn2, utilizing SM22α-Cre mice, results in
partial lethality between E13.5 and weaning, with surviving mutants displaying abnormal cardiac phenotypes.
These observations strongly suggest that PKN2 plays a critical role in the developing heart, however, because
SM22α-Cre is expressed not only in early developing cardiomyocytes, but also in smooth muscle, skeletal
muscle, and myeloid and lymphoid immune cells, this previous study does not address the cardiomyocyte-
specific requirement. Intriguingly, a recent study showed that deletion of Pkn1 and Pkn2 in adult
cardiomyocytes, utilizing αMHC-MerCreMer mice, did not affect basal cardiac function, but protected mice from
pressure overload- and angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting that PKN
inactivation could be a unique therapeutic target for heart failure. The contradiction between the partial
embryonic lethality of SM22α-Cre:Pkn2 knockout mice and protective effects observed in adult αMHC-
MerCreMer:Pkn1/2 double knockout mice highlights a critical need to define potential roles of PKN2 in
cardiomyocytes at different developmental stages. To address this contradiction, we have generated novel
Pkn2 cardiomyocyte-specific constitutive knockout (cKO) and Pkn2 tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific
knockout (icKO) mouse models utilizing Xmlc2-Cre and Tnnt2-MerCreMer mouse lines, respectively. Upon
preliminary characterization, Pkn2 cKO mice displayed partial postnatal lethality and cardiac morphological
defects as early as E12.5. Echocardiographic studies of surviving mutants revealed a dilated cardiomyopathy
phenotype in Pkn2 cKO mutants at both 1 and 3 months of age. In contrast to published reports that loss of
Pkn2 in adult cardiomyocytes does not affect basal cardiac function, our preliminary observations suggest that
Pkn2 deficiency in developing cardiomyocytes is detrimental. Taken together, the above evidence leads us to
the hypothesis that PKN2 plays distinct roles at different stages of cardiomyocyte development through the
phosphoregulation of specific substrates. Accordingly, our specific aims are: 1. To elucidate the role of PKN2 in
cardiomyocytes by analysis of cardiac and cardiomyocyte structure and function in Pkn2 cKO mice, and to
identify endogenous substrates of PKN2 in cardiomyocytes by utilizing unbiased phosphoproteomics and a
chemical-genetics approach with an analog-sensitive PKN2 mutant, and 2. To determine the cardiomyocyte-
specific requirement for PKN2 in postnatal development by analysis of Pkn2 icKO mice."
10795819,"The TL1 program at the New York University (NYU) – Health and Hospitals (H+H) CTSI provides innovative,
university-wide, transdisciplinary training of the next generation of scientists conducting clinical and translational
research (CTR). Our trainees arrive at an advanced stage of training, with established areas of inquiry and
capable primary research mentors, but require further mentoring and experience. Our guiding premise is to
change their worldview from one of personal scientific success, to a broader and more creative mindset where
they interact continually and span disciplinary boundaries to advance knowledge and health. Our program is
unique in both the wide scope of disciplines represented and in being the only T-supported program at our hub
to include trainees from clinical, basic, and non-STEM backgrounds. Trainees work across the lifespan and with
diverse populations to develop new approaches to improve health, and collaborate to develop transdisciplinary
and team-building skills and a broader translational vision. To support the emergence of clinical and translational
scientists, our TL1 program provides full-time pre- and post-doctoral research training focusing on trainees
interested in careers in CTR. Our three specific aims are to: 1) develop trainees with the collaborative skills
needed to lead multidisciplinary CTR teams; 2) enhance trainees’ communicative effectiveness across the CTR
spectrum; and 3) accelerate trainee career progression into independent CTR positions. Beyond supporting each
trainee’s methodologic skills and discipline-specific advancement, we focus on trainee development to provide
the skills most often cited as underdeveloped in multi-disciplinary, team-based science. To extend beyond
research training in specific disciplines, we promote the “Three Cs”—Collaboration, Communication, and
Career Development. The foundational project that transforms this aspirational philosophy into actual
behavioral change is our every-other-week Student-to-Scholar (STS) seminar—a forum where trainees meet,
reflect, learn, bond, and teach one another. Each session addresses an aspect of the three Cs. Trainees conduct
their own discipline-specific research with their research mentor and take additional courses related to the three
Cs (e.g., manuscript writing, team science, responsible conduct of research, career planning, grant writing), and
one elective course (e.g., health policy, drug development). Trainees also participate in the annual Association
of Clinical and Translational Science meeting, our CTSI’s fortnightly Translational Research in Progress (TRIP)
seminar, our monthly TREC Grand Rounds in Career Development, and an annual T and K research
symposium/networking meeting, hosted by NYU and including all CTSAs in the NYC area. We emphasize faculty
recognition of and response to the unique needs of each trainee, while maintaining a cohort model to provide
support, encouragement, and accountability. In the next funding period, our augmented mentor-training program
will emphasize co-mentoring so each trainee gets optimal personalized development as a translational scientist."
10816413,"Project Summary/Abstract
The lack of practical and effective strategies to manage hunger and adhere to a weight management intervention
represents a critical barrier to the weight management field. In proof-of-concept efficacy studies, we have
demonstrated that premeal water consumption (500 ml) acutely reduced perceived hunger and meal energy
intake among middle-aged and older adults, and that premeal water consumption (500 ml, 3 times per day)
increased the amount of weight lost (i.e., 2 kg greater loss) after 12 weeks among middle-aged and older adults
with overweight or obesity. However, water consumption may be important for weight management regardless
of when it is consumed. To address this possibility, we propose a rigorously-designed randomized controlled
intervention trial in adults aged 50+ years with overweight or obesity comparing three groups with different diet
prescriptions: 1) pre-meal water consumption (500 ml, before each main meal) with a hypocaloric diet; 2) 1500
ml water consumed throughout the day with a hypocaloric diet; 3) hypocaloric diet with no instructions regarding
water consumption. Smart water bottles will objectively assess water intake timing and volume. Urine osmolality,
urine volume, and serum osmolality will be used as objective indicators of compliance with the water intake
prescription. We will investigate changes in perceived hunger and fullness and appetite-regulating hormones as
potential mechanisms by which premeal water could improve appetite regulation. We will also investigate the
impact of water consumption and hydration on executive function capabilities, which may influence intervention
adherence. We hypothesize that weight loss at 12 weeks, and weight loss maintenance at 12 months, will be
greater in the premeal water group compared to the daily water volume and control groups. Furthermore, when
combined with a hypocaloric diet, premeal water will reduce hunger and increase fullness; these changes will
mediate adherence to the hypocaloric diet and weight loss outcomes. Although increasing water intake could be
an effective weight management strategy, no evidence-based recommendations exist for the timing of water
intake needed for this benefit. Our findings could identify a low-cost, actionable dietary strategy that could be
incorporated into clinical practice guidelines for obesity treatment, and improve adherence to a hypocaloric diet
prescription through reduced hunger, increased fullness, and improved attention and inhibitory control. This
proposal is aligned with the 2020-2030 NIH Strategic Plan for Nutrition Research (Objective 3.5) and the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025 due to its focus on older adults, an understudied population at increased
risk for obesity and inadequate hydration. If effective, this hydration/weight control intervention approach could
be applied to clinical populations such as adults with obesity who are prescribed increased water intake to
prevent or treat kidney stone disease or urinary tract infections, which are common in older adults."

This renewal application investigates the impact of dysregulated RNA processing in cancer.
Dysregulation of these events can elevate the production of proteins that function in all facets of
malignancy, without altering their transcript levels. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor
eIF4E, dysregulated in many cancers including in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), governs the
RNA processing of networks of transcripts that ultimately underpin its oncogenic activities. Its
ability to govern these regulons has been attributed to its well-established roles in nuclear export
and translation of specific RNAs. eIF4E elevation in cancer patients is correlated with aggressive
disease and poor outcomes. Here, we discovered that eIF4E reprograms various facets of cell
motility including adherence, migration, and invasion through its effects on RNA processing.
Indeed, we identified eIF4E-dependent RNA export targets that encode factors which are key
modulators of cell motility including hyaluronan, its main receptor CD44 and ezrin. Ezrin is an
intracellular protein that links CD44 signalling to cytoskeletal changes that alter adherence,
migration, and invasion. Furthermore, eIF4E directly interacts with ezrin. Three aims are proposed
to dissect the mechanistic principles and biological impacts related to these novel findings. We
will uncover the requirements for eIF4E to drive cell movement, determine the role of the ezrin-
eIF4E complex in translation and motility, and examine the role of the HA/CD44/ezrin axis in
eIF4E-dependent AML cell motility in mouse models. Our studies provide a unique opportunity to
identify novel biochemical mechanisms that underpin aggressive disease associated with
dysregulated eIF4E."
10768664,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to define the molecular mechanisms by which DNA replication is initiated and regulated in
metazoans. Cells rely on two AAA+ ATPases, ORC and Cdc6, along with a third factor, Cdt1, to load a latent
helicase (the Mcm2-7 complex) as a double hexamer onto replication origins. Upon entering S-phase, Mcm2-7
is activated by the GINS and Cdc45 accessory factors, melting the duplex origin. The resultant CMG
(Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS) assembly unwinds parental DNA strands and coordinates DNA synthesis by the
replisome.
Recently, we discovered that metazoan replication initiation factors – specifically the Orc1 subunit of ORC, as
well as Cdc6 and Cdt1 – use long, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) to bind DNA and partition into liquid
phase condensates (LPCs). This and other observations led us to a new functional model for replication, whereby
initiator IDRs and LPC propensity controls not only chromatin association, but also Mcm2-7 loading, partner
selection, and heterochromatin status. In Aim 1, we will resolve the molecular determinants by which initiator
IDRs facilitate condensation. In Aim 2, we will define how initiator IDRs control partner-protein interactions. In
Aim 3, we will establish how Orc1 uses its IDR to interface with pericentric heterochromatin through interactions
with other LPC-forming proteins such as Hp1. Significant outcomes expected to result from the proposed work
include: 1) defining how initiator IDRs – which we have shown to be a novel class of condensate-promoting
element – interface with DNA and each other, 2) uncovering new proteins capable of associating with initiation
factors, and 3) explaining how ORC connects to the formation and maintenance of genome organization and
expression.
IDRs have been predominantly thought to serve either as flexible linkers that allow mobility between ordered
domains, or as segments that undergo an induced-fit transition into folded structures through protein-protein
interactions. Recent work shows that IDRs can fulfill another role in specifying partner-protein interactions and
driving the formation of membraneless compartments through liquid phase separation. Our proposal will
establish how IDRs can lead to specificity for co-association and potential compartmentalization with origins and
other factors. Our efforts will inform areas of molecular biology where IDRs are used to manifest phase-separated
compartments or protein/nucleic-acid clustering for functional purposes. As ~25% of proteomes are predicted to
be unstructured, the utility of such insights will be broadly significant."

Millions of patients receive anesthetics every year to facilitate surgical and diagnostic procedures. While
anesthetics are remarkably successful in achieving their intended goals in the central nervous system of
unconsciousness, amnesia and analgesia, anesthesia is accompanied by a myriad of peripheral physiologic
changes (e.g. hypotension) that at times can be life-threatening. The majority of commonly used anesthetics
today augment GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system leading to their desired effects. It
has long been assumed that the accompanying peripheral physiologic perturbations that occur, result from
alterations in neuronal outflow from the central to the peripheral nervous systems and in turn to the end organs.
However, it is now appreciated that many of these end organs themselves express functional GABAA receptors
and that many of the physiologic effects of GABAergic anesthetics may in fact be due to direct GABAA receptor
cell signaling in these peripheral organs and cells. There is a large gap in knowledge regarding the
understanding of how GABAergic anesthetics interact with peripheral GABAA receptors on end organs (e.g.
immune cells, smooth muscle) to modify their function. A more thorough mechanistic understanding of the direct
physiological effects of GABAergic anesthetics on peripheral GABAA receptors will not only mitigate the
potentially life-threatening effects of anesthetics on peripheral physiology (e.g. hypotension), but will allow
peripheral GABAA receptors to be therapeutic targets in diseases such as hypertension, bronchoconstriction and
immune dysfunction. However, therapeutic targeting of peripheral GABAA receptors would have to avoid the
central sedative effects modulated by central GABAA receptors. Our laboratory was the first to discover GABAA
receptors expressed on airway smooth muscle and we subsequently identified novel imidazobenzodiazepine
derivatives that were modified to selectively target GABAA receptors containing 4 or 5 subunits and limit their
penetration to the central nervous system. These were important discoveries since most peripheral GABAA
receptors contain either 4 or 5 subunits, while central GABAA receptors that modulate sedation primarily
contain 1 and 2 subunits. Subsequently, we have shown the expression and functional effects of GABAA
receptors on immune cells and vascular smooth muscle. We will leverage these discoveries in the current
program to better understand the physiologic effects of a classic GABAergic anesthetic (i.e. propofol) and these
novel 4 and 5 subunit-selective benzodiazepine ligands on CD4+ lymphocytes, vascular smooth muscle and
airway smooth muscle function using cellular, ex vivo tissue and in vivo models from human and rodent sources.
Our findings will transform the mechanistic understanding of the physiologic effects of anesthetics, but more
importantly, identify potential novel therapeutic targets in hypertension, bronchoconstriction and immune
modulation."

Despite prolonged suppression of HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART), eradication or sustained remission of the
infection has not been achieved. Low levels of HIV DNA are still detectable in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) from people living with HIV (PWH) taking ART, and cells containing rebound-competent virus can
reside in sanctuary tissue sites, including lymph nodes, gut, genital tract and the central nervous system
(CNS). In a study conducted within the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, we have recently used highly sensitive
virologic assays in living donors to detect HIV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells in up to 50% on long-term
ART. Importantly, those with detectable CSF HIV DNA had poorer global cognitive function that those in whom
CSF HIV DNA was not detected. We have subsequently shown higher concentrations of HIV DNA in CD4+ T
cells from CSF compared to contemporaneous PBMC, and that atypical cell lineages including myeloid cells
may be infected in CSF. Finally, we have successfully used single cell transcriptomics to identify unique and
rare cell types in the CSF in PWH associated with HIV disease status and have further demonstrated the ability
to identify cellular transcripts enriched in PWH versus healthy controls. Critical gaps in understanding CNS HIV
persistence include what the characteristics and function of infected immune cells are in CSF, whether HIV
proviruses in CSF are intact and genetically compartmentalized compared to proviruses in blood, and how
these features relate to neuropsychiatric function of long-term HIV. Since the number of cells present in CSF is
low in PWH suppressed on ART, thorough, simultaneous characterization of the immunologic and virologic
landscape of the CNS has not been achieved. Using optimized lumbar puncture procedures and novel
molecular techniques, we have overcome these obstacles to both rigorously examine the phenotype of
CSF cells and thoroughly characterize the size, stability, intactness, and sequence diversity of persistent HIV in
CSF compared to blood. We will use single cell technology to measure the transcriptional and cytokine profile
of CNS cells combined with novel quantification of intact HIV DNA and single genome sequencing to discover
new correlations within the CNS reservoir. Most importantly, we propose to rigorously examine the cognitive
function and mental health of people living with HIV using sophisticated implementation of the new NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, and how differences in neuropsychiatric outcomes relate to
specific immunological and virological characteristics of the CNS in a diverse cohort of participants with a
range of neuropsychiatric comorbidity."

Research for the MDACC HALs. Under his leadership, there has been an unprecedented increase (1% in 2016
to 14% in 2021) in the proportion of HAL patients enrolled on radiation clinical trials. With the NCI-sponsored
cooperative groups, Dr. Chun currently serves as national Principal Investigator (PI) of a high-profile NRG
Oncology analysis, study champion of NRG/Alliance A082002, MDACC institutional PI of NRG-LU005, and has
been a top enroller for NRG Oncology-RTOG 1308 that was previously in jeopardy for closure due to poor
accrual. To achieve NCI-funded trial objectives in the MDACC HALs, Dr. Chun will spearhead the implementation
and expansion of a translational biomarker program, neurocognitive testing capabilities for NCI-sponsored
central nervous system (CNS) cancer trials, and the continuing medical education program on clinical research.
Dr. Chun is passionate about addressing healthcare disparities and is committed to establish a workflow to track
numbers of women and underrepresented minorities enrolled on clinical trials in the HALs, and independently
scrutinize patient inclusion and exclusion criteria and factors among to reduce demographic disparities. In order
to develop new research capabilities, Dr. Chun will join the leadership of the Protocol in a Day Workshop, which
is responsible for developing MDACC investigator-initiated radiation trials, establish the radiation clinical
research program at new and planned MDACC facilities, leverage artificial intelligence to capture more patients
eligible for trials, and continue to develop concepts with the NCI-sponsored cooperative groups. He will commit
a minimum of 20% of his effort (2.4 calendar months) to NCI-sponsored clinical research, and MDACC is
committed to support Dr. Chun’s efforts and conduct of NCI-supported clinical trials. The primary objective of his
career is to prioritize and expand institutional and NCI-sponsored trials in the MDACC HALs which aligns with
this R50 funding mechanism as well as with the broader mission of NCI."
10770462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dogma in the cardiovascular field argues that the adult mammalian heart is essentially non-regenerative and
that this failure to regenerate is primarily attributed to the post-mitotic and polyploid nature of most
cardiomyocytes (CMs). Multiple pieces of evidence now support the idea that within the adult mammalian
myocardium, mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs) are a privileged subpopulation of CMs that have
avoided this proliferative senescence. This attribute confers a unique capacity to re-enter the cell cycle and
regenerate myocardial tissue. Our recent work in mice demonstrates that the frequency of MNDCMs and the
competence to regenerate one's heart are two interlinked and variable traits influenced by the complex genetic
background of an individual. In other words, contrary to longstanding beliefs, some individuals can mount a
meaningful regenerative response after an insult, such as a myocardial infarction. We then took a genome-
wide association strategy to identify the genes associated with the observed variation. From this analysis, we
identified Tnni3k as one candidate that regulates CM senescence by inhibiting cytokinesis, specifically. Here,
we identify two new candidate genes each of which has a unique effect on CM cell cycle and ploidy.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that identified genes will work cooperatively to maximize the trait effect, thus a
multifactorial approach to heart regeneration is prudent. Aim 1 will explore the first novel candidate for its
independent effect on heart function and CM cell cycle activity in both uninjured and post-infarction settings. It
will also be tested in combination with Tnni3k. Aim 2 will examine the effect of the second novel candidate on
CM ploidy, cell cycle, and heart regeneration both independently and in combination with Tnni3k. Our prior
GWAS study affirms that CM ploidy and cardiac regeneration are complex phenotypes relying on multiple
genetic loci. Here, we use genetic approaches to modulate multiple candidate genes in a single animal model
and we anticipate that this combinatorial approach will potentiate CM proliferation and cardiac regeneration."

Many of our most onerous health burdens today are driven by complex and poorly understood interactions
between a person’s genetic makeup and his or her environment. In other words, genetic variation may
predispose individuals toward physiological sensitivity or resilience in the face of environmental perturbations.
Our modern environments are deeply diverged from the ancestral selective pressures that have shaped human
genetic variation through evolutionary time, raising the question of how much the “mismatch” between our
genomes and modern life is responsible for the non-communicable diseases that plague modern societies. This
concept, known as the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis, has become a central tenet of evolutionary medicine
and has potentially profound implications for how we study, manage, and treat a long list of conditions thought
to arise from genomes mismatched to our modern environments. However, this hypothesis has been difficult to
robustly test in practice, perhaps in part because we do not fully understand the mechanistic basis underlying
this phenomenon. Under a mismatch model, we would expect genetic variation that was neutral or beneficial in
past environments to become disease-causing in modern environments; in other words, we would expect this
mismatch to generate “genotype-by-environment” (GxE) interactions, such that some genetic effects on health
are environmentally dependent. My lab’s goal is to advance our understanding of how and why some individuals
are more sensitive to environmental stressors than others, and to identify the molecular and genetic drivers of
this variation. Work in my group has clearly established that the contribution of GxE to phenotypic variation is
pervasive and it is generally underestimated. We now want to move beyond accounting for the variance
explained by GxE and gain a mechanistic understanding of how these interactions shape phenotypic variation
and drive disease risk. Over the next 5 years, a major theme of my lab will be to use evolutionary mismatch as
a lens to study GxE. We aim to understand: (1) What makes a specific genomic region sensitive to its
environmental context? (2) What role does population evolutionary history play in this process? (3) Why and how
some individuals appear to be more sensitive than others to environmental perturbation? We are particularly
interested in studying a class of genetic effects that are only revealed by environmental change (also known as
“cryptic genetic variation”). Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how this class of variants drive
phenotypic variation is one of the major goals of my research program. Technological advances have fueled the
ascent of personal genomics and the promise of precision medicine. However, to unlock this potential, we must
first understand how the environmental and genetic interactions unique to each individual contribute to variation
in complex traits. This is the primary goal of this application and the focus of my research program – my work
leverages these tools to address questions related to the context-dependency of allelic effects using a powerful,
evolutionary lens. We conduct this work using both Drosophila and humans as a model."
10757636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite rapid advances in cancer therapeutic development, acquired drug resistance continues to
threaten the long-term efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents, necessitating the expansion of treatment
options targeting novel mechanisms to induce tumor cell death. To that end, induction of ferroptosis, a non-
apoptotic, regulated cell death modality, has been shown to be a promising anti-cancer strategy. To date,
ferroptosis susceptibility has been demonstrated in many cancer cell types, including clear-cell renal carcinoma
and hepatocellular carcinoma25. Ferroptosis has also been shown to be involved in the therapeutic mechanism
of existing therapies including sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, and immune checkpoint blockade
therapy26,27,30. Furthermore, multiple studies have reported that therapy-resistant cancer cells that persist after
conventional first-line drug treatments or that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition exhibit an
increased dependency on a druggable phospholipid hydroperoxidase enzyme, namely glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4)22-24, the central component and major inhibitor of the ferroptotic cell death pathway. Therefore,
defining the molecular mechanisms governing ferroptosis will likely reveal potential targets for the development
of novel cancer therapeutics.
 Ferroptosis is characterized by extensive lipid peroxidative damage to biological membranes that
overwhelms the ability of GPX4 to detoxify these lipid reactive oxygen species, eventually leading to cell death.
While the central mechanisms of this regulated cell death pathway have been elucidated, the mediators of
ferroptosis susceptibility are not fully characterized and the molecular signals and events that ultimately result
in cellular demise remain unknown. Our lab and others have demonstrated that widespread changes in the
cellular lipidome occur during ferroptosis, characterized by the significant upregulation of lysophospholipids
and certain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing diacylglycerols (PUFA-DAGs)2-7. The mechanisms that
mediate these changes and the functions they play in ferroptosis are as yet unknown. In this study, I will use
small molecule dose response, genetic modulation techniques, and lipidomic profiling to investigate the role of
phospholipase A2s (PLA2s, lipid remodeling enzymes that generate lysophospholipids), and PUFA-DAG
signaling pathways in ferroptosis. I propose that specific phospholipase A2 enzymes (specifically, ABHD12,
PLA2G15, and PLA2G10) are active in the removal of key sensitizing lipid species from the membrane and
potentially in the repair of oxidatively damaged membranes during ferroptosis (Aim 1). I further propose that
specific PUFA-DAGs coordinate downstream signaling cascades through activation of certain protein kinase C
subtypes, which have been implicated in oxidative stress pathways15, directing the cell toward cell death (Aim
2). A tipping of the balance between these opposing processes may determine cell fate."

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly potent in treating malignancies, >60% of them have been
reported to lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, anti-angiogenic TKIs, such as sunitinib,
preferentially induce microvascular toxicity followed by cardiac dysfunction. However, our knowledge of the
underlying pathogenic mechanisms of TKI-induced vascular toxicity (TKI-VT) has been hampered partially by
the limited access to human diseased vascular tissues for molecular and cellular analysis. As such, no effective
strategies have been developed to prevent or treat these otherwise life-threatening cardiovascular complications.
This proposed project will leverage patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiac pericytes
(PCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to understand the molecular and cellular basis of TKI-VT and discover
personalized therapies for cancer patients who are suffering TKI-induced cardiovascular disease. In Aim 1, both
monoculture and vessel-on-chip (VoC) coculture systems will be employed to characterize sunitinib-induced cell
type-specific cytotoxicity profiles and aberrant cellular crosstalk between iPSC-PCs and iPSC-ECs that can
contribute to TKI-VT. Overlapping upregulated and downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
triggered by sunitinib in both cell types will serve as the candidate genes for large-scale druggable target screens.
In Aim 2, CRISPR interference/activation (CRISPRi/a) survival screens will be performed in sunitinib-treated
iPSC-PCs using a customized lentiviral sgRNA library targeting the overlapping DEGs identified in Aim 1. Top
10 hit genes in CRISPRi and CRSIPRa machineries will be subjected to structure-based virtual screens (SBVS)
to discover candidate compounds that can mitigate TKI-VT phenotypes in iPSC-VoCs. In Aim 3, 3D iPSC-
engineered vascular tissues (EVTs) and a mouse model will be used to validate the mitigation efficacy of
candidate compounds on TKI-VT in a more physiological setting. The ex vivo plasma proteome generated from
human whole blood-perfused 3D iPSC-EVTs will be correlated with those identified in patients to discover reliable
disease-relevant biomarkers in predicting individual cancer patients’ susceptibility to TKI-VT. The research and
career development training plans during the K99 phase, under the mentorship of Drs. Wu and Ky, as well as
an expert interdisciplinary advisory committee, will provide Dr. Shen with advanced knowledge in stem cell
biology, vascular biology, cardio-oncology, CRISPR technology, and bioengineering. The development of
CRISPRi/a and SBVS screen platforms (K99) and 3D iPSC-EVTs (R00) will enable him to conduct disease
modeling and drug discovery research in cardio-oncology specifically and vascular disease in general. The new
skills and experience gained during this K99/R00 career development award, combined with Dr. Shen’s prior
expertise in vascular biology, will facilitate his transition to an independent career conducting basic and
translational research in cardio-oncology with a particular focus on the vascular aspect."
10768639,"Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in US veterans and worldwide. Molecularly
targeted therapy and immunotherapy are two recent major breakthroughs in lung cancer treatment that have
been shown to extend life and increase cure, but each of them benefits ~20% of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to identify new treatment targets and develop and
validate the assays that select the appropriate patients for molecularly targeted therapy and cancer
immunotherapy and monitor antitumor responses. We have recently generated and characterized high-affinity
peptide ligands for targeting tumor-specific and lymphocyte-specific integrins on the surface of multiple
epithelial cancer types including NSCLC and microvesicle exosomes derived from the membranes of specific
cancer or immune cells. We hypothesize that these high affinity peptide ligands can be used to improve the
sensitivity of detecting tumor- and immune cell-specific biomarkers in lung cancer patients. The overall
objective of this proposal is to develop easily operable, low cost, sensitive, multiplex assays to improve the
sensitivity of current molecular and immune biomarker tests, in a single blood draw or thoracentesis for clinical
decision-making in cancer treatment selection and monitoring. We will use biofluid samples collected from
patients with advanced NSCLC under IRB-approved protocol to optimize our novel in vitro diagnostic
platforms. In specific aim 1, we develop an assay for sensitive detection and enrichment of tumor cells from
malignant body fluids of NSCLC patients using LXY30 (for α3β1 integrin). In specific aim 2, we will develop a
novel in vitro platform for rapid and simple isolation of tumor-specific exosomes yielding high quantity and
quality tumor DNA to increase the success of clinical molecular biomarker assays. In specific aim 3, we will
develop a novel in vitro platform for rapid and simple isolation of functional immune cells in the blood from
NSCLC patients for flow cytometry, T cell receptor diversity, and single cell genomic characterization. We
anticipate that the clinical application of our novel, integrated, simple, low cost, in vitro diagnostic platform in a
serial noninvasive “liquid biopsy” can select the most effective treatment for cancer patients in real time and
thus has great potential to advance individual cancer patient care towards the goal of precision medicine."
10830275,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol is the most used and abused drug in the United States. Chronic alcohol abuse results in neuronal
degeneration and functional deficits in sensorimotor, memory, psychological, and cognitive functions. We and
others have demonstrated that oxidative signaling is the central mechanism in alcohol-induced injury that leads
to neurological and functional deficits. Remediation of accumulating oxidative radicals may serve as an
effective strategy for preventing the progression of neurological damage in alcoholics. Thus, this proposal will
study a novel hypothesis that the brain injury and associated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration
caused by alcohol-induced oxidative damage can be repaired by activating the antioxidant signaling Nrf2
(nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) pathway. The Nrf2 transcriptional system is an endogenous defense
mechanism that boosts the expression of many detoxifying, cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory genes by
interacting with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in their regulatory regions. Nrf2 has the potential to be
a novel and therapeutic target to mitigate alcohol-induced neural damage. Our central hypothesis is that
activation of antioxidant-promoting transcription factor Nrf2 alleviates oxidative stress-induced
pathophysiological changes associated with excessive alcohol ingestion. These changes include activation of
transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), neuroinflammatory responses,
and neurodegeneration. Activation of Nrf2 transcription factor and up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant
enzymes will be achieved by treating animals with Nrf2 activator III TAT peptide (Nrf2 peptide). We will
administer Nrf2 peptide to the alcohol ingested mice systemically (subcutaneous) and evaluate its therapeutic
potential in alleviating alcohol-associated neurological impairments in defined regions such as the prefrontal
cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. The proposed study not only validates the cause and effect of Nrf2
peptide in mitigating oxidative stress in AUD but also identifies the mechanistic regulation of Nrf2 transcription
factor activated antioxidant genes and their interactions with Nrf2 by ChIP-qPCR, and ChIP-Seq. The
protective role of Nrf2 will be determined by assessing its effects on gene expression and protein levels of the
major antioxidant, inflammatory, and apoptotic proteins. We will validate the effect of Nrf2 peptide in Nrf2
knock-out (KO) mice (Nrf2−/−). We will also use a cohort of behavioral tests that will utilize to assess cognitive,
sensory-motor feedback, and psychological behavioral recovery associated with Nrf2 peptide treatment
following alcohol exposure in wild type and Nrf2-/- mice. We will compare the results with control peptide
(random sequence with TAT) treated animals. We anticipate that the findings from this study will have
extensive clinical relevance."
10745731,"Cells integrate nutrient sensing and metabolism to coordinate proper cellular responses to a particular nutrient
source. One way this occurs is via post-translational modifications of proteins. Acetyl-lysine is among the most
studied modification and regulates dynamic processes ranging from chromatin and gene expression to
metabolism. Our preliminary data presented in this application expand upon the acetylation landscape and
describe a new protein modification called acetyl-cysteine. This modification is abundant across the proteome
and is enriched on proteins involved in metabolism. These early data reveal key gaps in our understanding of
the acetylation landscape: what is the tissue distribution of this new modification? Under which physiological
conditions does this modification change? Which proteins are modified? What is the cellular consequence of
cysteine hyperacetylation? Is this relevant for aging? There is a critical need to understand the full range of
protein modifications in order to better understand physiological nutrient sensing and how it is perturbed in the
setting of disease. Although it is widely accepted that lysine modifications can participate in intracellular nutrient
sensing and is dysregulated with aging, no data exists on acetyl-cysteine. Therefore, the single objective of this
exploratory grant application is to determine the site(s), consequences, and physiologic mediators of cysteine
acetylation. Aim 1 will investigate the prevalence of cysteine acetylation by tissue type and metabolic state. In a
complementary parallel approach, Aim 2 will characterize the effects of cysteine acetylation on protein activity.
This project is significant because it uncovers a previously overlooked protein modification. Furthermore, given
cysteine’s central role in redox homeostasis, it is poised to play a central role in metabolic homeostasis. We put
forth conceptual and technical innovations that will both follow directed hypotheses and allow unbiased discovery
of the most important aspects of this new protein modification. Successful completion of this project will reveal a
new aspect of intracellular signaling and metabolic homeostasis that could influence our understanding of redox
biology and metabolism during aging."
10771285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In numerous experimental studies, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, such as rapamycin,
prolong lifespan, prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) and improve
multiple other age-dependent processes. However, there are limited clinical data to know whether these
therapies have anti-aging effects in humans. The potential role of mTOR inhibitors as disease-modifying
treatment for AD/ADRD is of particular significance given the ongoing lack of clearly effective therapies and their
immense healthcare and societal burden. Concern over drug safety, particularly in older patients, has remained
a key reason as to why clinical trials investigating the potential benefits of mTOR inhibitors with respect to
AD/ADRD and other aging-related outcomes have not been pursued. Yet, the significance of increasing age as
a risk factor for mTOR inhibitor-associated adverse effects is not clearly established. Moreover, the majority of
clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors suggest that side effects are largely reversible with dose modification and rarely
severe. Further clinical investigation into the potential benefits and risks of mTOR inhibitors in the context of
human aging is therefore needed. Among patients currently receiving this therapy, transplant recipients are the
ideal population in whom to conduct a large and longitudinal observational study on the aging-related effects of
mTOR inhibitors. Advantages of this group include their prolonged survival, increasing prevalence and frequent
occurrence of common aging-related diseases (including AD/ADRD), among other reasons. The recent creation
of a comprehensive database linking national transplant registry data to Medicare claims by the PI represents a
welcome opportunity to study these critical knowledge gaps in a real-world cohort. In this study, we will leverage
and further enhance this linked Medicare database to investigate the effect of mTOR inhibitors on the survival
and healthcare utilization of older kidney and liver transplant recipients in Aim 1. We will subsequently evaluate
the effect of mTOR inhibitor therapy and its interaction with age on the risk of AD/ADRD using this data source
in Aim 2. Then, in Aim 3, we will establish the independent predictors of mTOR inhibitor adverse effects and
perform a comprehensive assessment of real-world drug safety in older transplant recipients using detailed
electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Veterans Health Administration (VA). In estimating mTOR inhibitor
treatment effects, this proposal will employ modern statistical techniques that draw upon the multidimensional
nature of Medicare claims data to strengthen confounder adjustment while applying a time-dependent
framework, a novel application of this technique in this research area. Our findings will bring new and important
evidence on the clinical effects and safety of mTOR inhibitors in older persons, which will subsequently establish
the feasibility of future trials of mTOR inhibitors as treatment for AD/ADRD and as anti-aging therapeutics.
Secondarily, the results generated will play a key role in developing consensus guidance that allow for an
individualized treatment approach for older kidney and liver transplant recipients in the U.S."

Maternal duplication of the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus (Dup15q syndrome) is a major genetic cause of
autism spectrum disorder. UBE3A is contained within this genetic locus; compelling evidence suggests it is the
main driver of Dup15q syndrome pathophysiology. Accordingly, the normalization of UBE3A levels might
effectively treat the syndrome, but this has been difficult to test. To allow us to test this idea, we have
generated conditional Ube3a-overexpression mice that have construct validity for the principal cytogenetic
abnormalities underlying Dup15q syndrome: interstitial chromosome 15 duplication (1 extra copy of Ube3a)
and isodicentric chromosome 15 (2 extra copies of Ube3a). Thus, our models will be valuable for determining
the extent to which increases in UBE3A protein levels are necessary and sufficient to drive Dup15q-relevant
pathophysiology. With these mice, we are also able to genetically normalize Ube3a expression at different
ages, allowing us to identify the window during which normalization provides substantial therapeutic benefit. To
advance an informed intervention strategy for Dup15q syndrome, we will use our new mouse models to (1)
establish the behavioral and physiological consequences of UBE3A overexpression, (2) determine when
normalization of UBE3A rescues pathophysiology, and (3) optimize an approach to appropriately knock down
UBE3A and correct pathophysiology in Ube3a-overexpression mice."

 Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are cellular membrane-less organelles comprised of RNA and
RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which form through the biophysical principle of condensation or liquid-liquid
phase separation (LLPS). An interesting group of cytosolic RNP granules are stress granules (SGs), that
form upon a variety of different stressors. Stress leads to a global translation inhibition, causing exposed
untranslating RNAs to condense and aggregate into SGs. Mutations in various SG proteins lead to aberrant
and constitutive SGs or RNP aggregates. Such RNP aggregates are associated with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and various muscular dystrophies. Therefore, it is of high
medical need to understand the principles of RNP granule assembly and disassembly.
 While the properties, mechanisms and functions of SGs are highly studied, nothing is known about
if, and how, SGs couple transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Therefore, my research
objectives focus on characterizing how SGs and/or the SG assembly scaffold protein G3BP1 regulate
transcription, thereby coupling cytosolic and nuclear stress responses to maintain cellular homeostasis. In
this application, I combine genome-wide, computational and experimental approaches to 1) determine if
transcription is affected by the formation of SGs and identify SG target genes, 2) characterize the detailed
mechanism by which SGs mediate transcriptional changes, and 3) examine nuclear functions of G3BP1
including possible direct roles in regulating transcription.
 During the K99 phase, under the mentorship of Dr. Roy Parker and Dr. Robin Dowell, comprehensive
approaches using genome-wide data analysis and cellular techniques will be used to determine if SGs
regulate transcription, identify SG target genes, and elucidate the detailed mechanism of this regulatory
pathway. With support from Dr. Amy Palmer, expertise in analyzing the role of SGs and/or G3BP1 in
metal/ion homeostasis will be acquired in order to identify if SGs and/or G3BP1 regulate metal/ion
homeostasis during stress response on the transcriptional level. Further, expertise from Dr. John Rinn in
studying the role of RNA in chromatin recognition will advance characterizing G3BP1 and the importance
of RNA in G3BP1-chromatin binding.
 Additional K99 training in genomic techniques and computational analysis will be essential for the
proposed research and advance my transition into and progress during the independent R00 phase.
 The results of this proposal will not only lead to identification of important SG and G3BP1 function,
but also provide a fundamental understanding of how RNP granules couple cytosolic and nuclear stress
responses."

 Disrupted communication between brain regions responsible for emotion regulation (limbic and
higher cognitive cortical regions) may critically underlie the emotional dysregulation that
characterizes mood and anxiety disorders. However, the most instructive metric of such
communication has yet to be agreed upon. In addition, due to technical barriers, there are
currently no fine-grained measurements of limbic subregion connectivity in humans. A network-
based approach can be used to explore limbic and cortical subregion connectivity (i.e.
connectome), shedding light on the discrete or shared neural mechanisms underlying core
symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders. In the proposed study we will (1) characterize small
limbic subregions and whole-brain connectomes in healthy controls and individuals with major
depressive and generalized anxiety disorder, by optimizing and employing a novel 7-Tesla MRI
protocol with improved spatial resolution with whole brain coverage; (2) discern network based
biomarkers of depression and anxiety by developing and characterizing a multi-modal
integrative brain network consisting of structural, functional and dynamic topographies using a
new computational multilayer approach; and (3) transdiagnostically examine how connectome
organization manifests across the three study groups. By portraying specific limbic subregion
involvement in the brain connectome, this would advance our understanding of how
connectome alternations manifest in psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, this work combines
high-resolution measures of brain activity and synchronization (functional MRI), with maps of the
brain’s white matter architecture and anatomical connections (diffusion MRI). Their combined
study will facilitate identification of aberrant network features and their contributions to core
symptoms in depression and anxiety. Lastly, the transdiagnostic approach will uncover shared
and unique network mechanisms of depression and anxiety that could potentially provide
improved diagnostics and treatment selection.
This Career Development Award will allow for the critical complimentary training goals
centering on: (1) gaining practical clinical experience towards identifying clinical needs and
conducting translational research; (2) development of technical advanced MRI sequence
development skills; (3) refine computational skills in advanced network science methods. The
proposed research and training afforded by this award will allow me to launch an independent
research program developing neuroimaging methods to study brain network perturbations in
mood and anxiety disorders."
10886525,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), representing a global health threat. The viral spike protein, anchored on the surface of the viral envelope as homotrimers, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediates the cellular entry of this virus. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike directly binds to ACE2, which induces a conformational change that facilitates virus fusion. This fusion event releases the SARS-CoV-2 genome into the cytoplasm. Spike protein, specifically the RBD, is the primary antigenic target for COVID vaccines in the market and interfering with the interface between RBD and ACE2 is the mechanism of action for the majority of existing therapeutic antibodies, indicating the importance of RBD and its binding to the cellular receptor for controlling SARS-CoV-2. Thus far, several cellular factors have been identified to facilitate cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (neuropilin-1, heparan sulfate, and C-type lectins). However, it is unclear whether there are any cellular proteins that inhibit viral entry. Our new preliminary data reveal that cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by a novel inhibitory cellular protein, Leucin-rich repeat containing 15 (LRRC15). We performed binding assays using recombinant proteins in cells and in cell-free models that show LRRC15 directly interacts with the RBD of spike with a moderate affinity (KD = 43~148 nM, depending on domain and variant). Although ACE2 also interacts with the spike via the RBD, the interaction of LRRC15-RBD does not compete or stabilize ACE2-RBD interactions, suggesting non- overlapping binding sites. Further analysis of human lung single cell RNA sequencing dataset reveals that expression of LRRC15 is primarily detected in fibroblasts and particularly enriched in pathological fibroblasts in COVID-19 patients. ACE2 and LRRC15 are not co-expressed in the same cell types in the lung. Strikingly, LRRC15 inhibits spike-mediated viral entry not only in the same cells, but also in neighboring cells in trans. Expression of LRRC15 in ACE2+ cells blocked spike-mediated viral entry in ACE2+LRRC15- cells, providing a unique concept of viral entry inhibition by an inhibitory factor. This result suggests a protective role of LRRC15 in a physiological context. Our central hypothesis is that human LRRC15 acts as an inhibitory entry factor for SARS-CoV-2, acting in trans as a decoy receptor expressed in non-susceptible pathological fibroblasts in the lung. This proposal will explore by which LRRC15 inhibits entry of SARS-CoV-2 in trans through two specific aims. Aim 1. Determine molecular mechanisms of entry inhibition by LRRC15. Aim 2. Evaluate pathological fibroblasts providing the inhibitory function ex vivo. This study provides an insight into therapeutic development and a better understanding of COVID-19."

Pathogenic variants of the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) gene cause the primary immunodeficiency disease
Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1; also called Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy with
Candidiasis and Ectodermal Dystrophy), which manifests as symptoms including chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and Addison’s disease among other autoimmune symptoms. AIRE prevents
autoimmunity by increasing the expression of tissue-specific genes in the niche of developing T cells, allowing
for the elimination of emerging self-reactive T-cells before they can mature. Sequencing of AIRE is an
increasingly common tool to diagnose APS-1, and earlier diagnosis can benefit patients. However, diagnosis is
limited by the fact that two thirds of variants are missense, and that more than half of the missense variants
found are “of unknown significance”. Testing the function of variants in cultured cells can provide strong
evidence for more informative variant classification, but these tests are carried out reactively, often months or
years after a new variant is first observed in a patient. A proactive solution to this problem is to efficiently
assess the function of all possible missense variants to generate a sequence-function map. Such maps can
provide immediate and accurate evidence to diagnose disease, even for never-before-seen variants. We have
developed and validated one scalable assay for testing AIRE missense variants, using human cells with a
fluorescent reporter of insulin promoter activity, and are exploring other scalable assays. We will:
1) Generate a sequence-function map to enable more accurate clinical interpretation of AIRE missense
variants and;
2) Validate and characterize the AIRE sequence-function map.
A sequence-function map of AIRE will provide key proactive evidence for rapid and definitive genetic diagnosis
of APS-1, and ultimately more positive patient outcomes."

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2), is a 125 kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase
and scaffolding protein that is overexpressed or amplified in many cancers, including ovarian, breast, colorectal,
melanoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancers. FAK is involved in multiple biological pathways that can
contribute to cancer progression, including cell migration, invasion, lymphangiogenesis, anti-apoptosis,
metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and signaling pathways mediated by PI3K/AKT and β-
catenin. FAK has been validated as a target in cancer therapy by genetic manipulation, and FAK knockdown
results in robust activation of apoptosis in cancer cells, with minimal effects in normal cells. Many ATP-
competitive FAK kinase domain inhibitors have been reported; however, these are only cytostatic and/or
moderately selective for FAK, and have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials. Kinase-independent roles of FAK
are not blocked by kinase inhibition; in particular, the scaffolding function of the C-terminal focal adhesion
targeting (FAT) domain. The FAK FAT domain is the major modulator of FAK-dependent anti-apoptosis and is
the domain regulated by the endogenous dominant-negative FAK isoform termed FAK-related non-kinase
(FRNK). Specifically, the FAT-paxillin protein-protein interaction (PPI) localizes FAK to the focal adhesion, and
mutation of residues at the FAT domain interface perturbs focal adhesion turnover, cell adhesion, migration, and
invasion. Thus, a major unmet need is the discovery of small molecule chemical probes that block FAK FAT
domain scaffolding. In order to target the FAK FAT domain, we have previously explored fragment screening by
SPR/NMR and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides. These approaches led to FAT fragment-based hits with
micromolar affinity and the lead stapled peptide probe, UA-1907 (KD = 1 µM) that induces apoptosis in melanoma
cells. For this project, we will develop novel drug screening assays leveraging chemical probe UA-1907 to identify
small molecule FAT ligands that disrupt the anti-apoptotic scaffolding functions of FAK. Specifically, we will: 1)
design a TR-FRET biochemical assay to screen a 35,000 compound PPI-biased library for hits that inhibit UA-
1907 binding to FAT; 2) confirm biochemical hits as FAT ligands using SPR and HSQC-NMR approaches; and
3) develop a NanoBiT cellular assay measuring FAK-paxillin binding to validate hits. In all, we expect this project
to identify the first described small molecule-based inhibitors of the FAT-paxillin interaction that will serve as the
basis for future medicinal chemistry optimization studies."
10775803,"Our study examines the Impact of Nursing Home Leadership, Care Environments and Health Information Technology on Outcomes of Residents with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Approximately 42% of 1.3 million nursing home (NH) residents have ADRD. NH residents with ADRD have frequent and longer length of stays than residents with other types of chronic illnesses. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are a predominant provider of NH care in the U.S. for residents with ADRD including 11,222 clinicians providing care in 5000 facilities. A growing strategy for improving resident outcomes is to effectively integrate health information technology (HIT) into NH care delivery. The use and integration of HIT into resident care, clinical support and administrative activities (known as HIT maturity) enhances care coordination and communication between NPs and staff, enabling NPs to manage resident health conditions better and improve resident outcomes. Evidence supports that NPs deliver higher quality care to residents in more positive care environments with supportive collegial relationships, greater access to resources and information. Studies focusing on care of NH residents with ADRD confirm that technology, shared communication, and care environments with clearly defined NP roles, helpful relationships, and supportive care lead to improved quality. We will examine the impact of NH HIT maturity and care environments on outcomes of residents with ADRD including hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Our specific aims are: 1) Provide comprehensive assessments of HIT maturity and NP care environments in NHs caring for residents with ADRD, 2) Examine the impact NH HIT maturity and NP care environments on disparities among residents with ADRD, and 3) Explore facilitators and barriers for achieving improved outcomes of residents with ADRD with diverse HIT maturity and care environments from the perspectives of NH administrators and NPs. During Aim 1 we will survey administrators and NPs from 1400 NHs collecting HIT maturity and care environment data from each discipline. We will link surveys to national NH data. We will assess differences in HIT maturity and NP care environments by NH characteristics. The association between HIT maturity and care environments will also be tested. During Aim 2 we will explore the potential mediating role of care environment on the relationship between HIT maturity and health outcomes. We will link surveys and resident level data (i.e. Medicare claims) during the same years’ surveys are conducted. During Aim 3 we will conduct key informant interviews with NH administrators (n = 70) and NPs (n = 70) representing diverse HIT maturity and care environments. Understanding HIT maturity and care environments where administrators and NPs work will help us identify methods to unlock their maximum potential to improve quality of NH care for residents with ADRD. We will identify differences in HIT maturity and care environments in NHs where administrators and NPs work, allowing us to identify targeted interventions that can be implemented to improve outcomes of residents with ADRD."

Increases in pediatric obesity have led to an increased burden of youth-onset (Yo) type 2 diabetes (T2D),
disproportionately affecting vulnerable youth. YoT2D is characterized by extreme insulin resistance, insulin
hypersecretion, rapid b cell failure, and increased complications compared to adult T2D, raising concern for
significant morbidity very early in life. However, the mechanism(s) and risk factors that cause some
adolescents with prediabetes (PreDM) to progress to YoT2D while others do not, remain poorly understood.
This proposal will study early pubertal youth at risk for YoT2D, to develop more precise prediction paradigms of
progression to YoT2D, and to investigate pathophysiologic drivers. YoT2D disproportionately affects racial and
ethnic minorities, often with multiple socioeconomic stressors, and the impact of social determinants of health
(SDoH) on progression to YoT2D must be clarified. Dr. Sheela N. Magge (PI) has assembled a highly-
experienced team from Johns Hopkins sites in Baltimore and Florida, including primary care pediatricians
(Perrin, Polk, Showell, Hernandez) at clinics serving large Black and Hispanic populations with socioeconomic
disadvantage. Participation in research by minoritized groups is influenced by the trustworthiness of the health
system, and study recruitment will be aided by leveraging these trusted care providers. Dr. Magge proposes an
innovative approach, recruiting from 3 distinct sources: 1. pediatric subspecialty clinics (endocrinology and
obesity), 2. general pediatric clinics serving low-income children of color, and 3. offspring of adults with early
onset (£40yrs) T2D. The study will longitudinally follow this cohort (total N=2250) of 9-13 year old girls and 10-
14 year old boys (site n=150) with BMI ≥ 85%ile and PreDM, as defined by HbA1c, fasting glucose, and/or 2-hr
glucose on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), over 3 years or diagnosis of T2D, whichever occurs first. They
will collect anthropometric, cardiovascular, behavioral, and genetic risk factors, as well as SDoH measures.
Physiologic testing, including mathematical modelling of insulin kinetics and free fatty acid flux (FFA) using a 3-
hour OGTT, in vivo continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and body composition, will be collected. Aims: 1) To
develop reliable estimates of YoT2D risk in youth with PreDM, overall and according to risk factor profiles that
differentiate groups based on their risk of progression to YoT2D, 2) To characterize the early pathophysiologic
drivers of YoT2D. a. To study differences in insulin kinetics (secretion, sensitivity, clearance), FFA flux, CGM,
ectopic fat (visceral, hepatic), and cardiovascular risk between youth who progress to YoT2D and those who
do not. b. To determine whether these pathophysiologic differences differ by risk factor groups identified in Aim
1. This proposal employs a multidisciplinary team with a novel mix of expertise in SDoH, stakeholder
engagement, and metabolic pathophysiology, an innovative recruitment approach, and cutting-edge, novel
methodologies to investigate the risk factors and pathophysiologic drivers that predict and cause YoT2D, in
order to inform future prevention and treatment strategies."

Among the several ongoing revolutions in biological research, two (the ability to visualize increasingly complex
biomolecular machines and assemblages and the ability to create novel protein structures and corresponding
functions) represent the foundation of our laboratory's research program. For many years, we have divided its
activities between (i) determining the structures, mechanisms and biological roles of gene targeting proteins
and base modifying enzymes, and (ii) employing protein engineering to create new protein folds, assemblages,
and functions, and to test our understanding of protein form and function. We now plan to renew and expand
upon our research mission by address several questions and problems in the fields of nucleic acid
enzymology, molecular recognition, and protein engineering.
The first two projects will build upon our experience studying and engineering homing endonucleases (also
called `meganucleases'). In doing so, we will answer questions surrounding the evolution, recognition
mechanisms and engineerability of (i) sequence-specific microbial RNA endonucleases and (ii) eukaryotic
retrotransposons. We plan to leverage our basic studies of these systems to create new tools for
transcriptomic analyses and genome engineering, respectively. The third project addresses a current
challenge in protein engineering: the accurate design of biomolecular interfaces that rely heavily on
stereospecific hydrogen-bond networks to facilitate the balance of affinity, specificity and reversibility that is a
hallmark of biomolecular interactions and regulation. To do so, we will create and then couple together protein-
protein and protein-small molecule binding functions through the creation of novel synthetic ligand-induced
protein multimerization systems. The project will contribute to the field of molecular design and engineering by
optimizing strategies for the accurate design of stereospecific hydrogen bond networks for that facilitate
protein-protein and protein-ligand recognition and binding."

By promoting replication through DNA lesions, translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) play a
critical role in preventing chromosomal instability and protecting against tumorigenesis. Unlike replicative Pols,
TLS Pols have less constrained active sties and they lack proofreading 3'→5' exonuclease activity.
Consequently, purified TLS Pols synthesize DNA opposite DNA lesions with an extremely low fidelity. Despite
this, TLS operates in a predominantly error-free manner in normal human cells (not derived from cancers), The
overall objective in this project is to identify the cellular processes and mechanisms by which high fidelity is
imposed upon TLS by the intrinsically highly error-prone Y-family Pols. Using a combination of genetic, cellular,
biochemical, and structural approaches, we will address the following questions: (1) Do the Y-family Pols
associate with other protein factors in a multiprotein ensemble and do these proteins have activities that elevate
the fidelity of the TLS Pol? (2) What is the protein composition of the entire Y-family Pol ensemble for error-free
TLS in human cells? (3) How is the fidelity of TLS modulated by the components of the multiprotein ensemble?
(4) What are the molecular underpinnings of action mechanisms via which components of the multiprotein
ensemble impose high fidelity on Y-family Pols? To pursue these questions, we have identified a number of
protein factors that function in TLS specifically in conjunction with Y-family Pols; included among these proteins
are WRN which possesses DNA helicase and 3'→5' exonuclease activities, and WRNIP1 which has a DNA
dependent ATPase activity. How these activities contribute to the fidelity of TLS by Y-family Pols opposite
different types of DNA lesions will be analyzed in extensive mutational studies that include genome wide
sequencing. Using proximity labeling in which TurboID is fused to Polη, we will determine whether there are
additional proteins that function in TLS in conjunction with Y-family Pols and whether activities in these proteins
affect the fidelity of TLS by these Pols. In biochemical studies with the purified multiprotein ensemble of Polη or
Polι, we will ascertain the roles of WRN 3'→5' exonuclease, WRN and WRNIP1 ATPase, and of any other newly
identified activities in the high fidelity of TLS by these Pols opposite different types of DNA lesions. From cryo-
EM studies with the purified multiprotein ensemble of Polη or Polι, we will determine mechanistically how the
components of the multiprotein ensemble modulate the fidelity of these Y-family Pols opposite DNA lesions.
 Cumulatively, these studies will identify the components of the multiprotein Y-family TLS replicases which
carry out high fidelity TLS in human cells. They will reveal the mechanisms by which the various components
constrain Y-family Pols' active sites to restrain nucleotide (nt) misincorporation and how WRN's 3'→5'
exonuclease activity is coordinated with the TLS Pol for the removal of misinserted nt. These studies will be
paradigm shifting and will open new vistas of research into the mechanistic details of TLS Pols' fidelity and they
will give impetus to further elaboration of the roles of TLS Pols in genome integrity."

The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Network Mouse Tissue Mapping Center (JAX-Sen)
represents a multi-modal interdisciplinary effort that draws upon existing, longstanding aging research programs
at JAX, our role as a consortium site of KAPP-Sen, a funded SenNet human Tissue Mapping Center, and JAX’s
close collaboration with UConn Health. JAX-Sen is organized around three cores nested in the well-resourced
environment for aging research and multi-omics profiling at JAX. JAX-Sen will profile senescent cells in kidney,
adipose tissue, placenta, pancreas, heart, and hypothalamus, selected for their clinical relevance to chronic
diseases of aging, the domain expertise of the JAX-Sen leadership team in the biology of these tissues, and the
overlap of four of the tissues with KAPP-Sen. We will leverage cutting-edge mouse resources including the
Diversity Outbred, which offers unparalleled genetic diversity for modelling a range of molecular senescence
phenotypes, and new inbred (C57BL/6J) transgenic mice that express p16 and p21 driven fluorescent tags to
allow visualization enrichment for specific senescent cell subsets. The Biological Analysis Core will apply a
multitude of analytical modalities to selected tissues (bulk and single cell and single nucleus RNAseq, Visium
spatial transcriptomics, multiplexed antibody-based imaging, multiplexFISH, imaging mass spectrometry
including lipidomics, metabolomics, proteomics, 3D tissue reconstruction from serial sections), and will re-
evaluate these technologies throughout the project period to ensure our approaches align with those of other
centers and that we maximally benefit from the technology development efforts in SenNet. These profiling
activities will yield subcellular resolution of biomolecular content in senescent cells not possible with human
samples, along with an expanded set of senescent cell biomarkers. The Data Analysis Core will combine robust
computational capability with scalable and reproducible scientific workflows to develop and implement Network-
wide open data and metadata standards. The Data Analysis Core will benefit from JAX’s unique mouse research
resources to establish the diversity of senescence by integrating with expression quantitative trait locus and
protein quantitative trait locus data in DO mice and JAX bioinformatics resources, e.g., Mouse Genome
Informatics, Mouse Phenome Database, Monarch Initiative. The integrative mining of JAX-Sen data will lead to
novel methods for multi-modal 3D map reconstruction from imaging data and will yield an important resource for
SenNet interpretation and enrichment of human senescent cell data. Finally, the Administrative Core will provide
strong oversight of project progress and nurture a culture of collaborative, dynamic scientific exchange within
JAX-Sen. It will also maximize JAX-Sen’s engagement in the consortium through collaborative activities that will
help optimize data generation activities and create new research synergies. In so doing, JAX-Sen will help
achieve the goal of SenNet to generate a unprecedented atlas of mouse senescent cells and new biomarkers of
senescence for human analysis and therapeutic application."

The increase in longevity, reduction in tooth loss, increase in periodontal diseases and coronal and root
dental caries with aging are contributing to an increased number of seniors with oral health care needs.
Dental caries and periodontal diseases disproportionately affect Alaska Native older adults: they are 3 times
more likely to have untreated dental caries and 1.7 times more likely to have periodontal disease than the
overall United States population. Prospective studies on the prognosis of these oral disorders are lacking,
particularly those deconstructing racial and ethnic differences. The goal of this research project is to
understand outcomes of geriatric patients with periodontal diseases and/or dental caries and identify
prognostic factors for success in disease control, with a focus on Alaska Native seniors.
Our primary aim is to estimate, separately, 36-month success rates for periodontitis and dental caries
management for geriatric patients overall, and for Alaska Native/American Indian seniors. Our secondary aims
are 1) to ascertain practitioner-, patient-, oral environment- and tooth-level prognostic characteristics
associated with 36-month successful disease control strategies; and 2) to describe initial disease diagnosis
and management strategies used by practitioners, and associated factors.
We will accomplish these aims by conducting a prospective cohort prognosis study within a tribal healthcare
organization serving urban and remote rural geographical locations in Southeast Alaska. In this observational
study, approximately 600 patients with periodontitis and/or dental caries will be systematically enrolled and
followed up for three years. Data on oral health, patient, and provider characteristics as well as diagnosis and
disease management strategies will be collected at baseline, and yearly up to 3 years after enrollment. This
study is innovative and highly relevant to public health and clinical research because it addresses the lack of
rigorous prospective US practice-based geriatric oral health research, and the uncertainty in prognosis and
prognostic factors when managing oral disorders in patients suffering the greatest oral health disparities.
Through prognosis research, we can gain important knowledge on how to potentially improve clinical decision
making for better Alaska Native geriatric oral health."

Understanding the pathogenesis of glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide, is an important goal
of vision research. As indicated in numerous population-based studies, individuals of African descent
develop glaucoma at an earlier age with increased severity and risk of blindness. Many studies have
identified oxidative damage to the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, leading to decreased outflow facility and
increased intraocular pressure. Although the evidence linking oxidative damage to glaucoma is strong, the
causes of oxidative damage in glaucoma are not known. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis
that oxidative damage to the TM is associated with basic genetic and physiologic differences in oxygen
metabolism leading to disparities in glaucoma based on racial background. Our hypothesis is based on
intraocular measurements of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) made in the human eye during surgery. We
identified strong correlations between pO2 and important risk factors for glaucoma, including central corneal
thickness and African-American/Black (B) heritage. In addition, measurements of a cell marker for DNA
oxidative damage were elevated in the aqueous humor of B patients with severe glaucoma compared to W
patients. Cultured TM cells from B healthy donors compared to W cells had altered energy (ATP) and
reactive oxygen species production, implicating the energy processing organelles, the mitochondria. Our
specific aims will test these hypotheses: (Aim 1) will evaluate differences in TM gene expression between B
and W donor controls and in patients at various glaucoma stages in order to identify the genetic basis of
disparities in tissue function (controlling eye pressure) and susceptibility to damage. Genes of interest will
be further studied (RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization) and delineate protein expression (Western blot) in the
tissue and potential biological pathways involved, focusing on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and
antioxidant protection. (Aim 2A) will study mitochondrial functions in primary human TM cell cultures from
specimens of B and W healthy donor controls and glaucoma patients at various severity stages. We will
determine the effects of racial differences and exposure to varying levels of pO2 on detailed analyses of
mitochondrial quantities and function, reactive oxygen species levels and antioxidant protection. (Aim 2B)
will also assess the cellular effects of potential antioxidative therapies. The proposed research is innovative
because understanding these physiological mechanisms potentially contributing to disease disparity based
on racial ancestry, confirmed by blood and tissue ancestral genotyping and mitochondrial DNA haplogroup
stratification, will provide important information about the pathophysiology of open angle glaucoma by
identifying factors responsible for the TM dysfunction and loss of aqueous outflow facility. The knowledge
gained in these studies may lead to new therapies and strategies to prevent this blinding disease."

 G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of membrane proteins and a major class of drug
targets, convert extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses by undergoing conformational changes that
enable them to bind and activate signaling proteins. Identifying the mechanisms that underly activation––the
atomic-level rearrangements that propagate from the ligand-binding pocket to induce large-scale motions on the
intracellular surface––can powerfully impact drug discovery but requires measurement of conformational change
at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Thus, activation mechanisms for only a small number of GPCRs have
been carefully mapped at the atomic level, hindering the rational design of therapeutics with high selectivity and
few side effects. Uncovering these mechanisms for those therapeutically promising GPCRs that operate as
multimers, with large extracellular domains, requires biophysical approaches that can bridge multiple scales.
 From my Ph.D., I have expertise in using physics-based simulations to capture conformational change in
membrane proteins with high spatial and temporal resolution, but the computational cost of molecular dynamics
(MD) limits accessible timescales and investigation of many members of a protein family. As a postdoctoral fellow
at UC-Berkeley, I have pursued experimental studies to fill in the gaps associated with classical MD simulations.
I have learned to carry out hydrogen-deuterium exchange–mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) under the supervision
of Dr. Susan Marqusee, enabling me to quantify the local stability of structural elements in a protein. More
recently, I have pursued an additional strategy, single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET),
to quantify the relative populations of states in a protein conformational landscape, under the guidance of Dr.
Ehud Isacoff. I will pursue computational and experimental studies of a difficult-to-drug class of GPCRs, the
metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). The mGluRs have a complex topology: the ligand-binding domains
(LBD) of these GPCRs transmit a ligand's effects laterally, to the neighboring subunit, and intracellularly, to the
transmembrane domain. In Aim 1, I will determine the mechanisms by which ligand binding affects
conformational changes within a single subunit; across the dimer interface; and below, to the transmembrane
domain. In Aim 2, I will investigate how sequence variation in the mGluR family leads to the strikingly broad
range of glutamate affinity and efficacy previously observed for the eight mGluR subtypes. In Aim 3, I will
investigate how endogenous extracellular binding partners modulate mGluRs to affect downstream activation.
This work will provide a general strategy for investigating mechanisms of conformational change for multi-domain
proteins and will enable discovery of allosteric ligands that can selectively target a particular receptor while
eliciting a specific signaling output. The rich scientific environment of UC-Berkeley, along with the support of my
outstanding mentors, will enable me to train in experimental biophysics while preparing for an academic career."

Cancer and cardiovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. Given the high percentage
of cancer patients with co-existing atherosclerosis, the development of cancer therapeutics that prevent
progression of atherosclerosis have the potential to align cancer therapy goals with favorable cardiovascular
outcomes. Hyaluronic acid (HA) has unique properties that are desirable for the development of biocompatible
and biodegradable nanoparticle drug delivery systems for both cancer and atherosclerosis. We have developed
a hyaluronic acid nanoparticle (HANP) conjugated with PD1 memetic peptides that target and block immune
checkpoint protein PD-L1 and carry the cholesterol-lowering drug Avasimibe (PD1Y-HANP/Ava). Avasimibe is a
multifunctional agent that decreases cholesterol accumulation, inhibits tumor cell growth, and enhances immune
response by activating cytotoxic T cells. We found that systemic administrations of PD1Y-HANP/Ava led to
targeted delivery into tumors and atherosclerotic plaques, inhibition of tumor growth and atherosclerosis
progression, and significant improvement in mouse survival in a dual mouse cancer and atherosclerosis model.
In this study, we hypothesize that systemic delivery of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), PD-
L1 and CD44 co-targeted HANP carrying Avasimibe (ATF/PD1Y-HANP/Ava) leads to the efficient delivery of the
HANP/Ava into tumors and atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in a significant anti-tumor growth effect by direct
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and pro-immune modulatory effect of
ATF/PD1Y-HANP/Ava in tumor microenvironment. We further hypothesize that delivery of targeted PD1Y-
HANP/Ava into atherosclerotic plaques decreases cholesterol-rich macrophages and infiltrating immune cells,
and thereby prevents atherosclerosis progression. To develop and validate the proposed immunotherapy, we
will first develop ATF/PD1Y-HANP/Ava and examine the efficiency of targeted delivery in metastatic mouse colon
cancer models (Aim 1). Therapeutic efficacy and immune responses following targeted PD1Y-HANP/Ava
treatment, alone or in combination with a chemotherapy drug, irinotecan, will be evaluated in the mouse cancer
models (Aim 1). We will then determine the effect of the targeted PD1Y-HANP/Ava on targeted delivery, immune
responses and therapeutic efficacy in tumor and atherosclerotic plaques in a dual mouse colon cancer and
atherosclerosis model (Aim 2). Immunological analysis of tumors and atherosclerotic plaques will allow us to
determine therapy-related changes in immune cell types and functions, especially CD8+ T cell activity. We will
then investigate the feasibility of translation in cancer patients by examining targeted delivery and direct cytotoxic
effect of the targeted PD1Y-HANP/Ava in colon cancer patient derived xenograft models (Aim 3). Finally,
pharmacokinetics, toxicity, biodistribution and systemic immune responses will be determined in mice (Aim 4).
Results of this research should provide us with preclinical data for translational development of a phase 1 clinical
trial using this novel targeted immunotherapy for metastatic colon cancer patients with comorbid atherosclerosis."

The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that genetic risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) identifies individuals with a “vulnerable brain,” who may be
predisposed to bad outcomes, including delirium, cognitive decline, and AD/ADRD, in the presence of an
inflammatory insult (e.g., surgery or infection). Delirium and AD/ADRD have strong epidemiological
associations: AD/ADRD has long-been recognized as a risk factor for delirium, and recently delirium has been
implicated as a risk factor for incident AD/ADRD. Although this points to a clear link between delirium and
AD/ADRD, the shared pathophysiology underlying these relationships remains largely unknown. Growing
evidence highlights inflammation as a common biological mechanism of delirium and AD/ADRD, but not all
individuals with high inflammation develop delirium and/or AD/ADRD. Therefore other predisposing factors
(possibly genetic) likely influence the effect of inflammation on the brain. In the proposed R01 Specific Aims,
we will address this gap in knowledge and substantially extend our prior studies by: 1) moving beyond single
candidate gene approaches to examine the synergistic effects of multiple genetic loci (e.g., polygenic risk
scores, shown to enhance clinical prediction of AD/ADRD), and 2) consider how polygenic risk of AD/ADRD
and inflammation interact to increase risk of delirium, cognitive decline, and AD/ADRD. These studies will
leverage the considerable resources of six datasets: (1 & 2) the NIA-funded program project, the Successful
Aging after Elective Surgery Study (SAGES; P01AG031720) I and its renewal SAGES II, (3) INTUIT
[Investigating NeuroinflammaTion UnderlyIng Postoperative Brain Connectivity Changes, Postoperative
CogniTive Dysfunction, Delirium in Older Adults; K76-AG057022 and UH2/3 AG056925], (4) MADCO-PC
[Markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and Cognitive Outcomes after Perioperative Care], (5) MARBLE [Modulating
ApoE signaling to Reduce Brain inflammation, deLirium, and postopErative cognitive dysfunction;
R03AG050918]; and 6) the population-based UK Biobank, a large cohort of older adults who have already
been genotyped. This proposal is highly novel in examining polygenic risk scores and their relationship with
inflammation in multiple datasets with information on delirium and AD/ADRD (unavailable in most studies).
Importantly, the results will inform targeted, pathophysiologically-based treatments to provide neuroprotection
for vulnerable older adults, thereby potentially preventing delirium and reducing AD/ADRD, two major threats to
the independence and quality of life of all older adults."

 This study endeavors to answer the following, potentially paradigm-changing question: in humans, does gut
leak increase during the menopause transition (MT); and if so, does gut leak lead to immune activation, bone
mineral density (BMD) decline and fractures? In murine models, a newly uncovered mechanism of bone loss is
a menopause-related diminution of gut barrier integrity, and its downstream sequelae, which include
translocation of gut microbe-derived antigens, immune activation, osteoclastogenesis, and bone loss.
 This study will further investigate whether this leaky gut pathway of hypogonadal bone loss in mice also
occurs in humans; our pilot work suggests that it does. In a longitudinal study of 65 women from the Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), we found that a “leaky gut phenotype,” characterized by
diminished gut barrier integrity and translocation of gut microbe-derived antigens, increases during the MT. We
investigated the leaky gut phenotype using a plasma marker of decreased gut barrier integrity (fatty acid
binding protein 2 [FABP2]), and a plasma marker of translocation of microbial antigens (soluble CD14
[sCD14]). FABP2 and sCD14 increased from pre- to postmenopause, and greater levels were associated with
higher C-reactive protein (a non-specific inflammation marker available in SWAN) and lower BMD.
 This application proposes a vastly more definitive examination of the leaky gut phenotype across the MT
and its longitudinal relations to immune activation, BMD, and fracture in a larger SWAN sample. Confirming the
leaky gut phenotype is related to bone loss during the MT could open a potent avenue of osteoporosis
prevention because: 1) average BMD loss during the MT and early postmenopause (~6 years) totals 1 T-score
unit; and 2) faster BMD decline during this interval relates to fractures, independent of peak BMD.
 We will measure FABP2, sCD14, and a panel of immune markers salient to the leaky gut pathway of bone
loss using banked plasma collected from 1,054 SWAN participants before, during, and after the MT. Aim 1 will
characterize the trajectory of change in each marker of the leaky gut phenotype from pre- to postmenopause.
Aim 2 examines whether within-individual increases in leaky gut phenotype markers are associated with
increased immune activation. Aim 3 tests whether within-individual increases in the leaky gut phenotype are
associated with decreased BMD. Aim 4 assesses whether larger increases in the markers of the leaky gut
phenotype during the MT are associated with greater rates of future fracture.
 Completing these Specific Aims will substantiate whether the leaky gut phenotype is associated with
immune activation, bone loss, and fracture in women. Positive results would motivate future studies that could
tests interventions aimed at maintaining gut barrier integrity and lessening the amount of translocated gut
microbe-derived antigens. This research agenda could ultimately generate a new way to combat osteoporosis:
by blocking a MT-related increase in the leaky gut phenotype, before substantial bone loss occurs."
10775730,"Children’s neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), have tremendous societal, economic, and personal consequences. The
incidence rates and behavioral presentation of these disorders vary by genetic sex, with a male bias. While
multifactorial risks have been reported for this male bias, the mechanistic origins remain unresolved.
Increasingly, epidemiological and animal studies identify a role for endocrine disrupting chemical (EDCs)
exposures in the etiology of children’s NDDs. However, translating risk is difficult because early childhood
exposures are increasingly characterized by low dose exposures to mixtures of EDCs, as exemplified by a
recent study that found 90% of newborn children had measurable serum levels of both bisphenol-a (BPA) and
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at birth. Our previous data utilizing a curated mixture (MIX) of EDCs,
representative of these infant exposures, found that a low dose EDC mixture altered testosterone (T) levels in
male mice at birth and resulted in male-specific behavioral changes, including reduced attention, impulsivity,
and reduced sociability, phenotypes seen in ADHD and ASDs. Occurring in both rodents and humans, males
experience a surge of T shortly before and after birth that is essential for nervous system development. Our
data indicate that T at birth may be a sensitive target of multiple EDC mixtures. MIX exposure also marginally
reduced DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) levels and hypomethylated sensitive imprinted genes in male
striatum, a region essential for these behavioral domains. DNA methylation profiles are influenced by various
EDCs and suggested as a potential mechanism by which EDCs confer risk. Consequently, this proposal will
investigate a hypothesized mechanistic pathway linking EDC-induced elevated T levels at birth with DNA
hypomethylation in striatum as a mechanism of sex-dependent behavioral deficits. This hypothesis will be
examined in a series of 3 Aims that systematically manipulate endocrine and epigenetic signals and track brain
and behavioral function into adulthood. First, it will test the ability of neonatal T administration to phenocopy
both the epigenetic and behavioral consequences of MIX EDC exposure. In addition, the role of EDC-induced
DNA hypomethylation via DNMT inhibition will be tested using a genetically modified strain of mice with
reduced DNMT1 activity. Because epigenetic mechanisms of brain development are highly region and cell-type
specific, and our prior assessments used whole striatum, the proposed aims will investigate genome-wide DNA
methylation profiles in neurons from ventral striatum. As an essential step forward, this proposal will integrate
translational behavioral assays and advanced epigenetic techniques to inform our understanding of male
vulnerability. The perinatal T surge is an understudied target of EDC neurotoxicity. The proposed studies will
significantly expand our limited knowledge of how EDC mixtures alter CNS development in a sex-dependent
fashion and will provide new data that are essential for risk assessment and public health protection."
10782466,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a life-long disorder that alters joint biomechanics and increases
the risk of early osteoarthritis. The most common treatment for DDH is periacetabular osteotomy (PAO), which
surgically reorients the abnormally shaped acetabulum to better cover and stabilize the femoral head. After PAO,
patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) improve for many, but not all, patients, and PROMs for most
patients remain below the levels of their healthy peers. Recent work has shown that aberrant biomechanical
variables, including disproportionate joint reaction forces, high acetabular edge loads, and low abductor muscle
strength, are related to specific geometric deformities in DDH prior to PAO. These altered biomechanics are also
related to worse PROMs. The current project seeks to optimize surgical care for DDH by determining the effects
of, and relationships among, PAO-induced changes to hip geometry, biomechanics, and PROMs. Aim 1 will
assess how PAO-induced changes in bony geometry alter hip biomechanics. Geometric and biomechanical
profiles for patients (N=60) undergoing PAO will be established before surgery using magnetic resonance
imaging, motion capture, and musculoskeletal modeling. Changes to patients’ biomechanical profiles resulting
from PAO-induced changes to geometry will be determined at 6 and 12 months post-PAO. Aim 2 will establish
target ranges for PAO surgical correction based on the sensitivity of biomechanical outcomes to variability in
acetabular reorientation. Surgically feasible combinations of changes to patients’ acetabular geometry will be
tested using probabilistic analysis, musculoskeletal models, and high-throughput computing to predict the
resultant changes to biomechanics. Aim 3 will determine the relationships among PROMs, activity levels, and
biomechanics pre-PAO and over the first 12 months post-PAO. Electronic questionnaires and wearable sensors
will be used to monitor PROMs and activity changes as patients recover from surgery. From these data, we will
demonstrate how hip biomechanics and activity levels differ in patients with improved PROMs compared to those
with unresolved symptoms. Results from the project will inform customized surgical plans according to patients’
initial bony geometry and help surgeons and patients focus on modifiable treatment factors that are associated
with improved outcomes. Likewise, new information about variables such as post-PAO activity levels and muscle
strength will inform rehabilitation to further improve outcomes. Finally, this project will pave the way for long-term
longitudinal analyses of PROMs, biomechanics, and joint structure to inform surgical and rehabilitation
approaches that predictably mitigate early hip osteoarthritis."

10851678,"OVERALL- Abstract
 Infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmune disorders affect hundreds of millions of older adults. They
reduce length and quality of life across the globe and inflict a massive economic burden on society, as vividly
exemplified by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, that has claimed 93.1% of its victims amongst those 50 years and
older, and 74.4% in those 64 and older. Yet, despite decades of research, restoring protective immunity in
older adults has remained elusive. One critical factor contributing to age-related immune decline is a loss of
naïve T (Tn) cell numbers and function, and their rejuvenation is highly desirable in order to enhance protective
immunity and overall healthspan in older adults.
 The renewal of this T cell Rejuvenation Program Project is centered on two key questions: (1) why do Tn
cell numbers and function deteriorate with age; and (2) what can be done about it? The premise of the program
is that Tn cell aging is multifactorial and that it can only be resolved by targeting multiple defects. Thymic
involution and the resulting decline in T cell production is the earliest event leading to immunosenescence.
This reduction is compounded by a decline in bone marrow function, as well as by defects in Tn cell
maintenance and function in the periphery. These deficiencies combine to erode the ability of the older immune
system to detect and eliminate infectious agents and neoplastic cells, and to properly guard against
autoimmunity. In the first program period, we strongly confirmed our initial hypotheses that lymphoid organ
stromal elements deteriorate earlier than previously thought, and in a manner to decisively erode immunity,
with aging. We will build on the synergy and success of the initial program period, where discoveries in one
project are critically informing science in others, and continue to identify mechanistic reasons behind reduced
central and peripheral lymphoid organ function with aging. We will then develop combined strategies to
ameliorate these defects to improve immune defense in the elderly. Our hypothesis is that mechanistic
dissection of defects in both thymic production AND peripheral Tn cell maintenance is required to devise and
test effective interventions for T cell rejuvenation in the elderly.
 Three integrated projects led by experts in the field, supported by four cutting-edge cores, will test this
hypothesis and achieve the following Program Goals: 1. Define mechanistic changes in primary and secondary
lymphoid organ aging; 2. Determine the endogenous regenerative capacity of thymic and secondary lymphoid
organ stroma over the lifespan; 3. Relate the progression of murine thymus, lymph node (LN) and T cell aging
phenotypes to humans; and 4. Devise and test rejuvenation strategies to improve thymopoiesis, T cell survival
and peripheral T cell maintenance and function, so as to enhance protective immunity.
 Over this support period, the above goals will provide a wealth of basic knowledge that will be translated to
preclinical models and be poised for translation to older adults."
10851679,"CORE A- Abstract
 The success of multidisciplinary, multi-investigator scientific programs critically depends not only on the
scientific quality of the individual research programs and their thematic synergy, but equally on the ability of the
group to work together and to stay on course to accomplish larger goals of the common endeavor. Even
greater scientific advancements are possible if teams can enhance the quality of science by cross-fertilization
of ideas and the potential to draw new conclusions from cross-analysis of data contributed by studying different
components of the same system (organism). Coordination of the above issues is particularly critical when the
area of research lies at an interface of two complex disciplines, as is clearly the case with research at the
interface of immunology and gerontology. All of the above necessitates a deliberate and systematic approach
to ensure Program success at all levels.
 To that effect, the Scientific Integration and Administration Core (Core A) will be the nerve center of the
Program, coordinating every aspect of its scientific and administrative progress. Specific Aims are to:
 SA1. Ensure scientific communication and exchange via: (i) regular monthly group videoconference
 meetings; (ii) a common and interactive experimental planning and data sharing space – the Thymus
 Rejuvenation PPG GoogleDoc platform and (iii) annual in-person PPG progress meetings. This Core will
 also organize and promote animal, tissue and reagent sharing via the above three means.
 SA2. Ensure fiscal and administrative oversight by monitoring spending with regard to specific aims
 and productivity of individual Projects and ensure timely annual reporting to the sponsor.
 SA3. Organize and implement scientific oversight. via (i) an internal PPG Scientific Steering Committee
 (PSSC), consisting of Project Leaders; and (ii) an external advisory board (EAB) composed of three
 scientists with strong expertise in the areas of the Program.
 SA 4. Provide coordinated data and knowledge sharing and management platforms (DKMP) to
 enable the distributed team members to securely share and harmonize data; to facilitate documentation of
 experimental progress and results; and to share laboratory protocols and analytic tools. This SA will
 oversee coordination of experimental data flowing to Core B that will be optimized via controlled
 ontologies, standardized meta-data collection, and common ID conventions to facilitate data mining, and
 cross-discovery between P1-P3. A Project Management Platform (PMP) utilizing GoogleDocs and Wiki
 technologies will facilitate inter-Project and Core interactions and delivery of Program goals under the
 guidance of the PSSC (see SA3). Of particular importance are the integration of single cell RNA-Seq data
 across projects, that will be integral for answering Program-level hypotheses.
This Core will therefore foster scientific integration at the highest level, while providing administrative cohesion."

Immune effector cells (IECs) targeting tumor associated antigens, such as with chimeric antigen receptors
(CARs) and bi- and tri- specific antibodies, offer unprecedented results in patients previously considered
incurable. The number of cellular immunotherapies for solid tumors and hematological malignancies has
dramatically increased. CAR T cells are now being considered early in the patient’s treatment plan as in children
with CD19+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), no longer reserved for salvage therapy. However, as experience
grows, a number of issues need to be addressed urgently. The grand challenges of adoptive IEC therapy include:
on-target/off-tumor toxicities, T cell exhaustion, tumor escape by antigen loss, immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment, variable persistence, and time and cost of individualized product manufacture, limiting global
access. To this end, there are 5 important research themes woven throughout the 3 Projects and 4 Cores,
specifically, 1) the need for safe and effective allogeneic off-the-shelf IECs, 2) IECs that can target multiple tumor
antigens to minimize tumor escape, 3) development of drug regulatable CARs for greater control, limiting on-
target/off-tumor adverse effects and T cell exhaustion, 4) more selective cytokine stimulation to enhance IEC
persistence and potency with minimal systemic side effects, and 5) translation of new engineering methods for
industrial-scale manufacturing. During the current funding period, there have been key discoveries that will drive
the next 5 years of this grant, specifically: the finding that (a) Tregs are effective cancer IECs which can be
engineered to effectively target and kill cancer comparable to conventional T cells, (b) ability to generate iPSC-
derived CD8 iTregs as a renewable starting cell source, readily amenable to genetic engineering and ex vivo
expansion, (c) iPSC-derived NK cells engineered to express a high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16a (hnCD16) and
membrane-bound IL-15/IL-15R without expression of CD38 enhances in vivo persistence and NK fitness and
permits use of anti-CD38 antibody for in vivo depletion of regulatory cells, (d) the construction of antibodies that
engage multiple targets, i.e. NK cells and tumor cells, with a stimulatory cytokine increase anti-tumor efficacy,
and, (e) large scale IEC manufacturing, providing 100s to 1000s of cell doses, is possible. These discoveries will
be further optimized and tested in relevant model systems in support of clinical translation. Project 1 will test
the hypothesis that engineered allogeneic CD4 Tregs can be engineered to express synthetic stimulatory
receptors and drug inducible CARs for maximum safety and reduced risk of exhaustion. Project 2 we will test
the hypothesis that off-the-shelf CD83 CAR iPSC CD8 iTregs can be engineered to avoid rejection and
exhaustion but retain potent tumoricidal activity against AML. And, Project 3 will test the hypothesis that the
combination of iNK genetic engineering and antigen specific targeting with TriKEs and CARs will enhance
specificity, potency, persistence for maximal AML killing."
10837836,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have dramatically shifted the treatment paradigm for many
patients with cancer. Broader use of autologous CAR-T cell therapies, however, is hindered by complicated
logistics, variable quality, T cell exhaustion, antigen escape and on-target/off-tumor effects and other toxicities,
like CRS. The broad objective is to address these issues by the development of a safe and effective off-the-
shelf cell therapy. To accomplish this, we propose a different cellular vehicle, specifically Regulatory T Cells
(Tregs). Advantages of Tregs include (a) an inherent ability to suppress the release of proinflammatory
cytokines and host mediated allogeneic rejection, and (b) proliferative capacity for large-scale expansion and
genetic engineering, ideal characteristics of an allogeneic immune effector cell (IEC) therapeutic. Based on the
safety and efficacy profile of third party Tregs previously tested in phase I/II trials for prevention of graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD), and their tumoricidal potency in preclinical models, this strategy addresses some of the
grand challenges facing allogeneic IECs. During the current funding period, in proof of concept studies, we
demonstrated the tumoricidal activity of Treg expressing CARs targeting CD19+ and CD83+ hematological
malignancies. Our central hypothesis is that allogeneic Tregs can be engineered for enhanced persistence
and maximal tumor killing with reduced risks of adverse side effects compared to conventional T cells.
Specifically, we will establish the safety profile of CAR19 Tregs at the maximal tolerable dose without and with
rhIL-2 in patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (Aim 1A, Aim 1B), assessing in
vivo pharmacokinetics and persistence as well as tumoricidal activity. To avoid the potential side effects of
systemic rhIL-2 and avoid bystander activation, we will engineer CAR19 Tregs to express an orthoIL2Rβ
responsive to orthoIL-2 to maximize persistence and tumor killing (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, we will test the potency
of nanoCAR Tregs targeting CD83 on AML cells and not myeloid progenitors (Aim 2A). Additionally, to
minimize Treg exhaustion from tonic stimulation as well as enhance safety, Tregs will be engineered with a
drug inducible CAR permitting control over its activation (Aim 2B). These IND enabling studies will support
future clinical testing. IMPACT. The availability of safer and more effective allogeneic ‘off-the-shelf’ tTreg IECs
would address a critical unmet need, overcoming some of the principal limitations of individualized products.

10837842,"Abstract We propose to develop nontoxic, tunable off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell-based
immunotherapy to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Murine CD19 CAR CD4 Treg adoptive transfer fully
prevented graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and eliminated all CD19 lymphoma cells. Surprisingly, the
mechanism was not CD4 Treg mediated suppression of Teffectors to below that needed for GVHD but above
that needed for graft-vs-leukemia (GVL). Instead, these Tregs had dual suppressor and cytolytic functions as
evidenced by equal killing comparable to Teffectors at a Treg purity level of 99.9%. In vitro and in vivo killing was
ligand dependent. These encouraging data led to testing of human CD19 CAR CD4 Tregs that also killed in a
ligand specific manner. Peripheral blood CAR CD8 induced Tregs (iTregs) were equally potent for target cell
killing as CAR CD8 Teffectors. Human CD19 CAR CD4 Treg adoptive transfer alone rescued 50% of mice from
a lethal lymphoma dose. With encouraging results, we pursued human pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that
produce CD8 but not CD4 T cells and are highly amenable to multiplex gene editing due to their self-renewing
properties. These data lead to Our central hypothesis that gene-edited off-the-shelf CD83 CAR iPSC CD8 iTregs
will avoid rejection and exhaustion but retain dual GVHD/GVL function. Edits are designed for site specific
integration or disruption, including Foxp3 (completed), circumventing rejection by macrophages (CD47 over-
expression) and the adaptive immune system by deleting HLA class Ia/II, and STAT3 to render Tregs resistant
to Teffector conversion. Embedded in genome editing are key biological questions as to how changes in proteins
affect the initiation, maturation and function of CD8 iTtregs, providing a great opportunity to study human T cell
development and control mechanisms. CAR therapy for AML is challenging due to on-target/off-tumor toxicity.
We nominated CD83 as differentially expressed on malignant compared to nonmalignant myeloid cells. A
nanobody CAR generated from a camelid library has exquisite potency against AML cells. The requirements for
in vivo persistence and function of CAR CD8 iTregs that correlate with efficacy will be addressed here. While
persisting CAR T cells may control AML, T cells that undergo tonic or repetitive signaling can become exhausted
and unable to control disease. CAR T cells must be tuned for a productive immune response but not overly
vigorous to drive cells into a state of dysfunction manifested by poor effector function, inhibitory receptor
expression and altered transcriptomics and epigenetics. Strategies ranging from TCRα deletion and reliance on
CAR signaling to immunotyrosine activation motif deletion to dampen CAR signaling but leave TCR signaling
intact and to switch CARs turned on/off by stopping a drug dimerizer. Aim 1 hypothesizes that genome modified
off-the-shelf human iPSCs will generate CD83 CAR CD8 iTregs that resist rejection, augment GVL and control
GVHD; Aim 2 hypothesizes that gene-edited human iPSC CD83 CAR CD8 iTregs need intermittent TCR or CAR
signal persistence without exhaustion to effectively suppress GVHD and kill patient AML blasts"

Abstract
Mutations in PPM1D (Protein Phosphatase Magnesium-Dependent 1 Delta), which codes for a member of the
protein serine-threonine phosphatase family, have recently been found in individuals with Jansen-De Vries
Syndrome (JdVS), a condition characterized by intellectual disability (ID), severe anxiety, oppositional
behavior, attention problems, high pain threshold, restricted eating, and gastrointestinal problems. So far,
several dozen children with JdVS have been reported in the literature. Remarkably, each has a de novo
germline nonsense or frameshift mutation in exon 5 or 6 that predicts the formation of a protein truncated at the
C-terminal end. The phosphatase domain is spared. A key question is whether the truncating mutations result
in gain- or loss- of PPM1D function in neurons and other brain cells. PPM1D is also a tumor suppressor gene
that is over-expressed in a variety of cancer subtypes, contributing to malignant transformation through its
action as a negative regulator of the p53-mediated DNA repair pathway. In cancers, somatic, truncating
mutations in exons 5 and 6 like those found in JdVS, but somatic in origin, result in gain-of-function (GOF)
effects because PPM1D degradation is reduced. Yet, loss-of-function (LOF) variants in the catalytic domain
have also been found in some cancers, suggesting that the effects of PPM1D on cellular function could be
context-dependent. Whether the germline truncating mutations in children with JdVS cause GOF or LOF is a
critical question to address because PPM1D inhibitors being developed by cancer researchers could
potentially have therapeutic value in JdVS if the former is correct. On the other hand, if they cause LOF, drugs
targeting over-phosphorylated downstream targets caused by reduced PPM1D phosphatase activity, would be
a more feasible approach. To address these fundamental questions, we have established an induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model for JdVS using patient-specific and CRISPR-engineered lines, each
containing exon 5 or exon 6 truncating mutations. Preliminary RNA-seq and proteomics experiments on
glutamatergic neurons derived from iPSCs identified a few functional signatures, including deficits in neurite
outgrowth, altered chromatin architecture, and calmodulin kinase 2 (CAMK2) phosphorylation that suggest a
GOF effect. However, molecular studies need to be repeated and expanded in additional lines to firmly
establish these as legitimate phenotypes, and to identify novel makers that can be used to both test the GOF
hypothesis and identify downstream targets for therapeutic intervention. This will be accomplished by a multi-
OMICs approach on glutamatergic neurons that includes proteomics, phosphoproteomics, RNA-seq, and
ATAC-seq. Considering the uniqueness of the PPM1D mutations in the development of JdVS, we also
hypothesize that truncated PPM1D proteins have powerful effects on cellular function that could make them
resistant to typical PPM1D inhibitors. To test these hypotheses, we will knockout either the mutant allele or wild
type PPM1D allele by introducing a null mutation using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, after which, rescue of
dysregulated cellular and molecular phenotypes will be assessed. The ability of small molecule PPM1D
inhibitors to rescue these phenotypes will also be evaluated. The experiments will show whether JdVS
associated PPM1D variants have a GOF effect on glutamatergic neurons, and whether generalized reduction
in PPM1D phosphatase activity or targeted inhibition of the truncated protein will be suitable targets for
therapeutic intervention."

 Suicide rates have risen sharply over the past 20 years1. There is a need to more precisely identify
proximal risk indicators for the development of near-term suicide risk in order to effectively intervene. Studies
utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to collect data at several intervals per day have demonstrated
that suicidal ideation (SI) and proximal risk factors change rapidly across the course of the day2. However, prior
EMA studies examining SI dynamics implement stable assessments, with intervals of several hours between SI
assessments across the duration of a study period3 for all participants. This one-size-fits-all approach to SI
assessment fails to capture the nuanced within-person variability of the timescale of the development of acute
suicide risk. In turn, we lack even a basic understanding of within-person variability in the time varying
relationship between SI and its proximal risk factors.
 The proposed study aims to address the limitations of current assessment approaches in proximal suicide
risk research through the development of a personalized, adaptive time sampling system. The specific objectives
of the proposed research are to: (1) develop a novel, adaptive time assessment system that more efficiently and
accurately identifies when an individual is at highest risk for SI; and (2) advance the understanding of SI and its
theoretically-informed proximal risk factors at finer timescales. Data collected according to varied timing
schedules in the first phase will be used to train an algorithm that generates predictions of suicide risk, predictions
that will be adaptively use to determine assessment timing during the second phase of data collection. Aim 1 is
to develop the adaptive time assessment system, followed by assessing the predictive accuracy of the adaptive
sampling system (Aim 2) and identifying variations in person-specific effects of the relationship between SI and
theoretically-informed risk factors (Aim 3).
 The research team (PIs: Ammerman, Jacobucci; Co-I: Cheng; Consultants: Burke) has access to world-class
expertise, with extensive experience in EMA data collection in high-risk samples, machine learning for suicide
prediction, longitudinal data analysis, collecting and modeling continuous data streams, and the development of
adaptive assessment platforms.
 To meaningfully reduce suicide rates, a more nuanced understanding of suicidal thoughts and associated
risk factors is required. Our adaptive assessment platform will more efficiently assess suicidal thoughts and risk
factors, allowing for a closer approximation of the true associations. Indeed, there is a need to identify near-term
risk factors prior to suicidal thought occurrences to successfully deliver an intervention and prevent suicidal
outcomes. These findings will support the successful implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions
through increased precision of suicide risk detection and targeted intervention timing. Given the grave personal
and societal cost of suicide, this work has important public health implications."

Breathing, unlike most motor behaviors, is under automatic control to ensure homeostasis is maintained. This
vital physiological regulation of respiratory activity has been the predominant focus of the control of breathing
field. However, in awake animals, breathing is also conditionally modified by changes in behavior and emotion,
making it highly dynamic. How these state-dependent control mechanisms allow breathing to conditionally
dissociate from its underlying physiological regulation remains far less well understood. In mice, this distinction
between automatic and state-dependent respiratory control is exemplified by the rapid breathing frequencies
that are unique to the awake state. Thus, transgenic mouse lines that allow cell-type-specific manipulations are
an excellent model system to unravel the neural circuits and mechanisms that integrate breathing with
behavior and emotion. The parabrachial nucleus of the dorsal pons is an integrative hub for many affective
states and behaviors, including breathing, and its constituent neurons are similarly diverse in their gene
expression and axonal projections. This project characterizes a novel neural circuit in the lateral parabrachial
nucleus (PBL) that exerts potent respiratory control specifically in the awake state and can drive rapid
breathing frequencies not achievable by known mechanisms of respiratory rhythm generation. By combining
modern intersectional transgenic, viral vector, and optogenetic tools, the proposed experiments explore how
and when this PBL circuit controls rapid breathing (Aim 1); identify the brain regions downstream of these
neurons that mediate their potent respiratory effects and state-dependence (Aim 2); and test whether the
canonical medullary site for respiratory rhythm generation, the preBӧtzinger Complex, is also critical for
generating the rapid and dynamic breathing patterns that characterize the awake state (Aim 3). These three
interactive Aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of the network- and cellular-level mechanisms
that mediate the unprecedented state-dependent respiratory control by this PBL circuit. More generally, this
project will establish a framework for understanding the conditional control of breathing and significantly
expand our basic scientific understanding of how breathing is integrated with behavior and emotion. Insights
from these studies may also have significant implications for understanding pathologies associated with
dysregulated rapid breathing such as hyperventilation syndrome and panic disorders."

 Indiscriminate prescribing of opioids for chronic pain management has contributed to the current opioid
crisis. While opioids work well at stable doses for some patients, others experience poor pain relief with
significant risks of developing iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Similar risks may occur in the context of
extended postoperative pain management using opioids following major surgery. Ability to predict this
risk/benefit balance for individual patients is limited by inadequate understanding of mechanisms influencing
opioid responses and risks. To address this gap, our prior funded work has systematically evaluated
mechanisms contributing to differential opioid responses. We have shown that: 1) chronic pain patients at
increased risk of opioid misuse experience greater analgesia and subjective reinforcing effects of opioid
analgesics (e.g., drug liking, desire to take the drug again), 2) low endogenous opioid (EO) function predicts
greater analgesic responses to opioid analgesics (replicated across two studies), and 3) that low EO function
and endocannabinoid (EC) levels together predict greater subjective opioid reinforcing effects. Our data are
consistent with a reinforcement model in which differential opioid responding related to low EO and EC function
may enhance risk of OUD. Stress is a known predictor of risk for OUD, but mechanisms are not well
understood. EO and EC activity are however both known to inhibit stress responses. This project integrates
diverse literatures and will test in 120 chronic low back pain patients a novel mechanistic model in which
elevated stress, via links to low EO and EC activity, contributes to patterns of differential opioid responding that
will enhance OUD risk via elevated opioid reinforcing properties. Primary aims are: 1) to determine whether
stress-related measures are associated with analgesic and misuse-relevant subjective responses to placebo-
controlled oxycodone administration, and 2) evaluate associations between stress-related measures and both
EO function and EC levels, and test whether EO and EC mechanisms mediate associations between stress-
related measures and oxycodone responses. This project will assess stress at multiple levels (subjective,
cardiovascular reactivity to two controlled stressors, and pain-relevant heart rate variability [HRV] stress
markers) with quantitative assessment of EC levels, and assessment of EO function and opioid agonist
subjective and analgesic responses based on randomized, placebo-controlled crossover administration of
naloxone (for EO) and oxycodone (opioid responses). Laboratory stress measures will be validated using
EMA electronic diary assessment of stress. Results will provide unique mechanistic knowledge of
mechanisms contributing to known associations between stress and OUD risk, in line with the goals of PAS-
18-624, and highlight a novel and clinically-pragmatic HRV measure that might predict risk-enhancing
differential opioid responses before initiating opioid therapy."
10793622,"Most of a cell’s DNA is packaged into chromosomes located within the nucleus. An additional small circular
genome encoding only a few genes is located in the mitochondria. In some circumstances, cells release
extrachromosomal pieces of DNA from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), from the nuclear genome or in the form of
retrotransposon cDNA (rt-cDNA). There are two consequences of DNA fragment release. First, many organisms
activate an innate immune response that may result in chronic inflammation and cell death. This inflammation
may lead to severe diseases in human including some cases of heart failure, Parkinson’s disease or aging-
related chronic inflammation. Second, released DNA can be inserted at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs)
causing genome instability. Insertions of mtDNA, rt-cDNA and chromosome fragments destabilize the genome
and are common in cancer, whereas rare gene insertions at the V(D)J locus constitute a pathway of antibody
diversification. Despite a large body of evidence showing severe consequences of the release of DNA fragments,
it remains unknown what cellular events lead to its generation. The goal of this proposal is to understand the
mechanisms of free DNA formation and its insertion at DSBs. We will: (i) develop a high throughput method to
capture and sequence free DNA, (ii) understand the mechanism of insertion of free DNA at DSBs by
nonhomologous end joining and by alternative end joining, and (iii) decipher the mechanisms of linear DNA

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent adult leukemia in the United States and until recently
was treated with chemoimmunotherapy at the time of disease related symptoms. Our team has been a major
contributor to the introduction of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib and humbled by the results with
this agent. Along with this work our recently completed R01 grant for which we seek renewal generated over 30
publications related to mechanism of action, resistance, and toxicities observed with ibrutinib. Additionally, we
identified at least 5 new medications that either are in phase 1 clinical trials for resistant diease or will begin
within the next year. The initial results of ibrutinib therapy in frontline CLL are promising with 92% of patients
being progression free at 5 years and also having immune recovery that diminishes the frequency of infectious
morbidity. However, the great majority of patients still have a small component of minimal residual disease (MRD)
that requires continuous treatment resulting in long-term morbidity that impacts survivorship. When ibrutinib is
discontinuation after extended treatment, it has been observed that some patients rapidly progress whereas
other patients can have durable remissions off therapy. This suggests heterogeneity in the residual MRD tumor
populations among CLL patients on extended BTKi. Aim 1 therefore focuses on utilizing novel techniques
developed by the team to assess the clonal genomic, epigenetic, and biochemical changes in tumor cells from
baseline to an extended time on treatment in responding patients treated with ibrutinib for 3 years. Additionally,
we seek to understand differential immune statuses of patients with detectable compared to undetectable
residual leukemia. Such studies will better guide combination studies in ibrutinib responsive patients to eliminate
these residual cells and allow treatment discontinuation. Aim 2 will support a recently initiated phase 1b clinical
trial with VAY-736 administered to patients who have been on ibrutinib for 1 year or more. VAY-736 is a BAFF-
receptor directed antibody that blocks both BAFF signaling and also has enhanced antibody dependent
cytotoxicity. We have demonstrated a novel BAFF-BCL3 signaling pathway that is active in CLL patients on
ibrutinib and which may contribute later to resistance. Our pre-clinical and translational data support that VAY-
736 is synergistic with ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse model of CLL, that it blocks BAFF signaling in CLL cells, and
that NK cell function improves with ibrutinib therapy. This trial with ibrutinib followed by VAY-736 will be the first
to give delayed antibody therapy when ibrutinib mediated immune recovery has occurred. If successful, this trial
will provide justification to pursue future strategies allowing discontinuation of ibrutinib. Ultimately, our goal is to
develop combination therapies, such as the one herein with ibrutinib and VAY-736 which produces durable
complete remissions in a defined period of treatment leading to the ability to discontinue therapy and avoid the
need for continuous long-term therapy."

Cognitive and executive function deficits are among the most devastating consequences of fetal
alcohol exposure. Currently available treatments against these deficits have limited efficacy. Our
long-term goal is to identify specific functional mechanisms underlying the cognitive deficits
associated with FASD. Our objective is to use circuit tracing and slice electrophysiology to determine
the long-term impact of third trimester-equivalent alcohol exposure (TTAE) on components of the
cerebro-cerebellar system involved in executive function. Our working hypotheses are that 1) TTAE
reduces glutamatergic input from the orbitrofrontal cortex—a brain region implicated in FASD-linked
executive function deficits—to the cerebellar cortex via pontine nuclei neurons and 2) TTAE
decreases glutamatergic output from the cerebellum to the orbitofrontal cortex via the deep cerebellar
nuclei and the thalamus. Our rationale for using circuit mapping is to characterize the effects of TTAE
on the function of reciprocal orbitofrontal cortex↔cerebellum connections. This proof-of-principle R21
proposal will establish a strong foundation for an R01 grant application to extend this work. In Aim 1,
we will determine the effects of TTAE on the function of the cerebro-cerebellar system feed-forward
limb. We will use anterograde transsynaptic labeling, slice electrophysiology, and optogenetics to test
the hypothesis that TTAE persistently reduces glutamatergic transmission at synapses between
pontine nuclei neurons (that receive input from the orbitofrontal cortex) and cerebellar granule cells
(lobule VI) while also reducing feed-forward disynaptic inhibition at pontine nuclei neuron→Golgi
cell→cerebellar granule cell synapses. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of TTAE on the function
of the cerebro-cerebellar system feedback limb. We will use an intersectional approach consisting of
anterograde viral tracing coupled with retrobead labeling to test the hypothesis TTAE persistently
reduces monosynaptic glutamatergic and disynaptic GABAergic transmission at synapses between
deep cerebellar nuclei neurons—that receive input from lobule VI Purkinje neurons—and thalamic
neurons that project to the orbitofrontal cortex. The research proposed in this application is innovative
because it will systematically characterize, for the first time, the developmental effects of ethanol on
interactions among key components of the cerebro-cerebellar network. The proposed research is
significant because it will elucidate novel functional neurobiological mechanisms underlying fetal
alcohol exposure-induced executive function deficits, and identify specific biological targets for
interventions to ameliorate these deficits."

important roles beyond immune response, including synaptic pruning during development and adult
neurogenesis. Microglial activation has been shown to be involved in the progression of different
neurodegenerative diseases as well as in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Accumulating evidence
suggests that environmental chemical exposure increases the susceptibility to the development of
various neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. A majority of the studies investigating the
impacts of environmental chemical exposure on microglia have been conducted using in vitro cell
culture systems and very little is known about in vivo effects, especially during early life.
The proposed research is aimed at understanding the role of environmental chemical exposure on
microglial dysfunction in vivo in a well-established developmental model system using imaging,
molecular and behavioral approaches. It has two specific aims. In specific aim 1, we test the
hypothesis that exposure of zebrafish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) causes microglial
activation. These studies will be conducted using a range of environmentally relevant concentrations
of PCB126, a dioxin-like PCB that is ubiquitously distributed in the environment. Using transgenic
zebrafish expressing cell-specific fluorescent markers and time-lapse confocal imaging, we will
measure microglial morphology in response to exposure. In addition, the potential effects of microglial
activation on neuronal network as well as neurobehaviors will be quantified. In specific aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that PCB-induced microglia dysfunction is AHR dependent. Using AHR null
zebrafish, we will characterize the role of AHR in microglial activation. Wild type and AHR null
zebrafish will be exposed to a concentration of PCB126 that affected microglia and characterize the
effects both immediately after exposure and later in life. We will characterize the brain specific
transcriptional and epigenetic profiles associated with these changes using single cell RNA
sequencing and single cell DNA methylation profiling. The results from the proposed studies will
provide fundamental knowledge about the role of environmental chemicals on immune cells in the
brain."

Glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) is an enzyme that conjugates glutathione to small
molecule electrophiles. GSTP1 has been implicated in promoting the growth of many cancer
types where GSTP1 overexpression is proposed to promote metabolic re-wiring or sequester
cancer-related signaling proteins through protein-protein interactions.
 In contrast to the modest upregulation of GSTP1 in cancer reported by these studies, our
systematic evaluation of cancer cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient tumors finds that
GSTP1 expression is uniquely and dramatically silenced by many orders of magnitude in luminal
breast cancer, going from one of the most abundant cellular proteins to barely express. Her2
positive (Her2+) breast cancers have a bimodal GSTP1 expression distribution, with a significant
proportion also silencing GSTP1.
 Decreased GSTP1 expression in breast cancer allowed us to discover a novel, non-canonical
regulatory function of GSTP1: re-directing the flux of cysteine oxidation to structurally remodel the
proteome via allosteric disulfide bonds. These changes are critical for breast cancer
transformation since re-expression of GSTP1 and inhibition of redox signaling decreases the
transformation capacity of GSTP1-silenced breast cancer cells.
 This proposal focuses on two Specific Aims. First, is GSTP1 silencing a therapeutic
vulnerability in BRCA? Second, what are the molecular and redoxomic consequences of GSTP1
silencing? Together, these Aims will provide new mechanistic insight into how GSTP1 expression
drives redox signaling in breast cancer and determine if GSTP1 silencing is a therapeutically
actionable vulnerability."
10756521,"Project Summary
As advanced age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), targeting detrimental
age-related processes may lead to effective therapies. Mitochondrial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory
signaling are each thought to be key drivers of aging and AD. However, a clear understanding of the
connections between mitochondrial homeostasis, immune signaling and aging remains elusive. Mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) is normally kept within the mitochondria. However, under conditions of mitochondrial stress or
damage, mtDNA can be released into the cytosol thus encountering cytosolic DNA sensors and activating pro-
inflammatory responses. Cytosolic mtDNA has been reported in the brains of AD patients and cellular models
of AD, but, whether cytosolic mtDNA can be targeted for therapeutic intervention in AD has not been
determined. Moreover, fundamental questions remain regarding the occurrence and role of cytosolic mtDNA in
aging and age-related health decline.
In preliminary work, we find that aging leads to a striking decline in mitochondrial autophagy and a
concurrent accumulation of cytosolic mtDNA, which is linked to pro-inflammatory signaling in different organ
systems of Drosophila including the brain. Critically, we have discovered that adult-onset, neuron-specific
silencing of EYA, a molecule involved in sensing cytosolic DNA, dampens inflammatory signaling in the aged
brain and extends lifespan. In addition, we have developed genetic approaches to reduce cytosolic mtDNA,
via increased lysosomal DNase activity, in aged flies. These findings provide an important first step towards
understanding the mechanistic interplay between cytosolic mtDNA, immune signaling and healthspan.
Here, we propose to build upon these groundbreaking findings by exploring three broad questions:
1) What are the mechanistic relationships between mitochondrial homeostasis, cytosolic mtDNA, and
aging?
2) Does cytosolic mtDNA and associated pro-inflammatory signaling drive aging and age-related health
decline?
3) Can modulating cytosolic mtDNA and associated pro-inflammatory signaling counteract Alzheimer’s
disease pathogenesis?
 The work described herein will bring about fundamental knowledge towards our understanding of the
mechanisms of aging and AD-related pathology. Our findings may also lead to novel therapeutic approaches
to counteract aging, AD and related dementias."
10807006,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect up to 60% of individuals with bipolar disorder during their lifetime and is
associated with worse illness outcomes, yet few studies have been performed to clarify the causes of this
comorbidity. Understanding biological risk factors that associate with and predict the development of AUDs in
bipolar disorder could inform interventions and prevention efforts to reduce the rate of this comorbidity and
improve outcomes of both disorders. Identifying predictors of risk requires longitudinal studies in bipolar disorder
aimed at capturing the mechanisms leading to the emergence of AUDs. Previous work in AUDs suggest that
subjective responses to alcohol and stress-related mechanisms may contribute to the development of AUDs. In
bipolar disorder, altered developmental trajectory of critical ventral prefrontal networks that modulate mood and
reward processing may alter responses to alcohol and stressors; consequently, the disruption in typical
neurodevelopment may be an underlying factor for the high rates of comorbidity. No longitudinal data exist
investigating if this developmental hypothesis is correct. To address this gap, we will use a multimodal
neuroimaging approach, modeling structural and functional neural trajectories of corticolimbic networks over
young adulthood, incorporating alcohol administration procedures, clinical phenotyping, and investigating effects
of acute stress exposure and early life stress. Research aims are to identify biological risk factors—i.e., changes
in subjective response to alcohol and associated neural trajectories—that are associated with the development
of alcohol misuse and symptoms of AUDs over a two-year longitudinal period in young adults with bipolar
disorder and typical developing young adults. Longitudinal data will be collected on 160 young adults (50% with
bipolar disorder, 50% female; aged 21-26). This study is a natural extension of the PI's K01 award. How acute
exposure to stress and childhood maltreatment affects subjective response to alcohol and risk for prospective
alcohol misuse and symptoms of AUDs will be investigated. We will test our hypothesis that developmental
differences in bipolar disorder versus typical developing individuals disrupt corticolimbic networks during young
adulthood, increase sensitivity to stress, and lead to changes in subjective response to alcohol and placebo
response increasing risk for developing AUDs. This research project will be conducted by a multidisciplinary
team of investigators with expertise in bipolar disorder, AUDs, substance use disorders, stress, longitudinal
modeling, neuroimaging, and alcohol administration methodology. Essential to successfully improving clinical
prognosis in bipolar disorder are research results that enable better prediction, diagnosis, and treatment based
on the individual. There is a paucity of human clinical research investigating interactions between subjective
response to alcohol/placebo, corticolimbic development during the young adult epoch, and acute exposure to
stress and childhood maltreatment. Findings may inform intervention efforts that are more specific and may serve
as a model for improving life-long outcomes in bipolar disorder and typical developing youth."
10552529,"Traumatized and diseased joint cartilage is the leading cause of disability, afflicting 33% of the adult
population. State-of-the-art treatments for destroyed joint cartilage are seriously limited. Tissue engineering
has this far failed to regenerate high-quality cartilage and prevent subsequent cartilage hypertrophy and
degeneration. We have developed biodegradable nanofibrous hollow microspheres (NF-HMS) as a novel
injectable carrier for chondrocytes and successfully regenerated high-quality cartilage. To circumvent both
the shortage of autologous chondrocytes and the regulatory barriers to cell-based therapies, we propose to
regenerate cartilage and suppress hypertrophy and degeneration by injecting the novel NF-HMS
microcarrier that delivers key biological molecules to activate endogenous bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) for hyaline cartilage regeneration and suppress. First, we will mechanistically determine whether
HIF-1, HIF-2, or both promote chondrogenesis and prevent hypertrophy/degeneration. Second, we will
develop TGF- and the HIF stabilizer releasing NF-HMS to facilitate the chondrogenic differentiation of
human and rabbit BMSCs using in vitro and a subcutaneous implantation model. Third, we will use the novel
injectable NF-HMS carrier to synergize TGF- and HIF activities of endogenous BMSCs in order to
regenerate and maintain high-quality cartilage in a rabbit osteochondral repair model. By accomplishing
these specific aims, we will substantially deepen our understanding of the key factors that affect
chondrogenesis, cartilage regeneration, and prevention of hypertrophy and cartilage degeneration, leading
to a novel cartilage repair therapy without using exogenous or exogenously manipulated cells. The
understandings and strategies developed in this project can also be utilized to engineer other tissues.

10770432,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION
The Center for Cancer Mentoring, Education, Leadership, and Oncology-related Training (CAMELOT) serves as
the centralized hub for the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) fostering cancer
research and education, and disseminating those opportunities. CAMELOT’s efforts begin at the high school
level, continue through undergraduate and graduate training, and then extend through post-doctoral training and
into early faculty development and mentoring. CAMELOT is directed by Dr. Lawrence Kirschner, the OSUCCC
Associate Director of Training and Education. He is assisted by Drs. Deepa Sampath, Elizabeth Klein, and Rosa
Lapalombella. CAMELOT coordinates training and education programs through: 1) direct programs (e.g., for
high school, Pelotonia fellows, external undergraduate student summer rotations including students from Ohio
Historically Black Universities and Colleges); 2) integrating College of Medicine (COM) programs with OSUCCC
activities and opening them to trainees and junior faculty outside the COM; 3) supporting grant submissions by
junior faculty; and 4) supporting training grant submissions. The Pelotonia Fellowship Program (PFP), a major
commitment by the OSUCCC to fellowship training, has been in existence for 10 years, and provides stipends
and research support to fellows from the undergraduate to the postdoctoral fellowship level. OSUCCC provides
$2-3M/year to support the PFP. During the current grant cycle, 251 pre- and postdoctoral fellowships awarded,
of which 155 had mentors who were OSUCCC members from all five of the OSUCCC research programs and
10 of the 15 OSU Colleges. More than 90% of these trainees are currently active as cancer researchers. New
programs developed by CAMELOT include two cancer research-focused pipeline programs, one for local
underrepresented minority high school students and another for current OSU undergraduates. The Specific
Aims are to: 1) provide integration and coordination of training opportunities for cancer research across the
OSUCCC and university ecosystem, and region, including high schools and colleges; 2) enhance formalized
programming for cancer-based mentoring including both peer-to-peer and senior-to-junior mentoring; and, 3)
develop an integrated system to enable assessment and outcome tracking for trainees at all levels of
engagement with the OSUCCC (grants, papers, academic positions, etc.) to foster continuous quality
improvement in educational and career development activities. The OSUCCC is planning robust faculty
recruitment around strategic research priorities that will create new opportunities for education and training. To
accommodate this, a bigger pipeline for training is planned in the next funding cycle. The OSUCCC will: 1)
expand graduate and postgraduate training slots and programs for high school students; 2) establish the Young
Cancer Investigator Faculty Academy that focuses on OSUCCC wet-lab researchers to support development of
independent research programs; 3) establish a uniform tracking system for trainees; and 4) foster submissions
of R25 and T32 training grants, including supplements."
10770437,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CANCER BIOLOGY (CB)
The Cancer Biology (CB) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led
by Matthew Ringel, MD, and Philip Tsichlis, MD, has 56 members from 21 Departments and 5 OSU Colleges
(Arts & Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, Public Health, and Veterinary Medicine). CB investigators focus on
three thematic scientific areas of focus: 1) Defining the roles of non-coding RNAs, gene mutations, and regulation
of gene expression in cancer development and progression; 2) Determining new mechanisms of altered cancer
cell signal transduction and DNA damage repair responses, and responses to therapeutic challenges; and 3)
integrating cancer biology into complex model systems, computational biology, and human tissues to study
mechanisms of cancer progression. The overall vision of the CB Program is to exploit the fundamental
mechanistic knowledge gained in these areas of strategic emphasis to improve cancer prevention, treatment,
and outcomes through collaborations. The Specific Aims of the CB Program focus on: 1) Mechanisms of cancer
initiation. Studies focus on identification and characterization of mutations, epigenetic changes, and the
expression and function of coding and non-coding genes. The goal will be to discover novel mechanisms of
cancer predisposition and initiation, with an emphasis on translation; 2) Mechanisms and markers of response
and resistance to therapeutic and environmental challenges. Research focuses on cancer responses to
radiation and chemotherapy/targeted therapy with emphasis on signaling, DNA damage and the response to
hypoxia and anti-tumor immunity; and, 3) Mechanisms of cancer progression. Studies focus on the
identification of potentially targetable mechanisms that regulate tumor progression and metastasis. CB Program
members published 645 cancer-relevant manuscripts between 12/01/14 and 11/30/19. Of these, 10% were intra-
programmatic (multiple authors from CC Program), 25% were inter-programmatic (authors from multiple OSUCCC
Programs), and 73% were multi-institutional (authors from both CB and another institution). The total collaborative
publications is 81%. CB Program funding stands at $8.0M in overall direct, cancer-focused funding, of which
$7.7M is peer-reviewed, including $6.7M direct funding from NIH ($5.1M from NCI). Over the last 5 years, CB
Program members have accrued 1,522 participants to non-therapeutic/non-interventional trials comprised of
investigator-driven IRB-approved biospecimen repositories. As a basic science program, CB is designed for member
involvement in therapeutic trials through inter-programmatic collaboration. Future plans for the CB Program include
innovation and growth in cancer immunology, translational genomics leveraging inter-institutional resources such
as ORIEN, and identification of new targets, the development and growth of the cancer engineering research,
and for cancer prevention by increasing basic science studies for the development of cancer and genetic
predispositions."
10770443,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CANCER CONTROL (CC)
The Cancer Control (CC) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led
by Electra Paskett, PhD, and Theodore Wagener, PhD, has 53 members from 21 Departments and 7 OSU
Colleges (Arts & Sciences, Dentistry, Education & Human Ecology, Law, Medicine, Nursing, and Public Health).
The overall goal of the CC Program is to conduct research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity of
cancer in our catchment area, the state of Ohio, and beyond. The CC Program conducts research across the
cancer control continuum, from etiology through survivorship, and across the lifespan. Crosscutting themes unite
the aims of the program and include policy and underserved/minority populations, with a focus on the priority
cancers of the OSUCCC. Our research also capitalizes on our members’ strengths, such as epidemiology,
biology and behavior, and includes trans-disciplinary research teams to address research aims. The Specific
Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors related to cancer incidence
and mortality at a population level; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions that prevent cancer development
or facilitate early detection; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship (including active
cancer patients and survivors). CC Program members published 1,028 cancer-relevant manuscripts between
12/01/14 and 11/30/19. Of these, 17% were intra-programmatic (multiple authors from CC Program), 22% were
inter-programmatic (authors from multiple OSUCCC Programs), and 74% were multi-institutional (authors from
both CC and another institution). The total collaborative publications is 87%. CC Program funding stands at
$7.7M in overall direct, cancer-focused funding, of which $6.7M is peer-reviewed, including $6.2M direct funding
from NIH ($3.6M from NCI). Over the last 5 years, CC Program members have accrued 21,450 participants to
trials; 4,807 to non-therapeutic/interventional trials and 16,643 to non-therapeutic/ non-interventional trials.
Future plans for the CC Program include increasing research in: 1) molecular and genetic epidemiology; 2)
patient outcomes; 3) survivorship, including the effects of immunotherapy on patient outcomes through
collaborations with the new OSUCCC Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology; and 4) tobacco use and related
health-effects through the new OSUCCC Center for Tobacco Research."
10770458,"PROJECT SUMMARY – MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS AND CHEMOPREVENTION (MCC)
The Molecular Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention (MCC) Program at The Ohio State University
Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC), led by Steven Clinton, MD, PhD, and Richard Fishel, PhD, has
48 members from 22 Departments and 8 OSU Colleges (Arts and Sciences, Dentistry, Education and Human
Ecology, Food, Agriculture and Environmental Science, Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Veterinary
Medicine). The MCC Program examines cancer as an integrated and dynamic process over time, with a major
focus on the interface between genetics and the environment that collectively impacts the carcinogenesis
cascade. This approach provides a foundation for chemoprevention and dietary interventions to reduce the
burden of cancer in high-risk individuals as well as to decrease the incidence, mortality and morbidity of cancer in
our Ohio catchment area (CA) and the nation. Our expertise extends to defining standards for genetic screening and
counselling as well defining dietary and nutritional guidelines that impact cancer risk through public policy, nationally
and globally. The Specific Aims of the MCC Program are: 1) Carcinogenesis: To characterize the genetic,
molecular and cellular changes induced by germline, chemical, physical, hormonal or microbiological mediators
that contribute to neoplastic transformation and multistage carcinogenesis; 2) Chemoprevention: To develop and
characterize novel cancer chemopreventive agents and define their efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action
using biochemical, cellular and preclinical models that ultimately lead to early phase human studies; and, 3) Diet,
Nutrition and Metabolism: To identify dietary patterns, nutritional components, and lifestyle variables that
enhance or inhibit the carcinogenesis cascade across the continuum of cancer progression. MCC Program
members published 547 cancer-relevant manuscripts between 12/01/14 and 11/30/19. Of these, 14% were intra-
programmatic (multiple authors from MCC Program), 31% were inter-programmatic (authors from multiple OSUCCC
Programs), and 72% were multi-institutional (authors from both CC and another institution). The total collaborative
publications is 83%. MCC Program funding stands at $7.9M in overall direct, cancer-focused funding, of which
$7.0M is peer-reviewed, including $6.8M direct funding from NIH ($3.4M from NCI). Over the last five years, MCC
Program members have accrued 1,487 participants to trials; 670 to interventional trials and 817 to non-interventional
trials. MCC members serve as leaders of the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative involving 3,651
participants (3,310 colorectal and 341 endometrial) and ORIEN Total Cancer Care with enrollment of 50,683.The
MCC program is fully integrated with the high priority crosscutting research initiatives of the OSUCCC and future plans
complement and enhance programmatic aims while promoting interactions with the other research Programs and focus
on 1) metabolic signatures in carcinogenesis and prevention; 2) the microbiome and immunology interface with
Pelotonia Institute for Immuno-Oncology initiatives; and 3) collaborative efforts with the Center for Cancer Engineering."
10770463,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TRANSLATIONAL THERAPEUTICS (TT)
The Translational Therapeutics (TT) Program at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center
(OSUCCC), co-led by David Carbone, MD, PhD, Blake Peterson, PhD, and Elaine Mardis, PhD, unites an
outstanding team of 79 basic, translational and/or clinical researchers from 18 departments within The Ohio
State University (OSU) Colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Medicine and Nationwide Children’s
Hospital (NCH). The goal of the TT program is to translate advances in solid tumor molecular biology and
promising preclinical studies into innovative clinical trials to improve the state of the art in the diagnosis and
treatment of solid tumors. Solid tumors are by far the major causes of cancer death in our catchment area (the
state of Ohio), dominated by diseases of special interest in this program, including lung, breast, colorectal, head
and neck, thyroid, and gynecologic cancers. As a result of existing expertise and collaborative scientific efforts,
as well as focused recruitments across a spectrum of disciplines, the TT program exhibits strength in basic and
translational research in lung cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, breast cancer, sarcoma, and glioblastoma,
as well as newly enhanced capabilities in drug development. The Specific Aims of the TT program are to: 1)
identify and therapeutically target alterations in solid tumor proliferation and survival signaling pathways; 2)
identify tumor-host interactions and target them via small molecule and immunotherapeutic approaches; and 3)
develop and improve upon approaches for determining prognosis, selecting appropriate therapies, and
evaluating the response to treatment. During the current funding cycle, the TT Program successfully recruited
28 solid tumor clinicians, basic scientists, and physician-scientists. In addition, TT investigators produced 1130
peer-reviewed publications; 178 of these were published in high impact (≥10) journals, 16% resulted from intra-
programmatic collaborations, and 31% from inter-programmatic collaborations; 74% were multi-institutional; a
total of 86% were collaborative publications. TT members collaborated on programmatic grant submissions and
were awarded one NCI P01, two U01s, and two UG1s, as well as two T32 training grants. The TT Program has
$9.2M in current annual direct costs from peer-reviewed grants, $6.6M (71%) of which is from the NCI. The TT
Program is well-integrated with the clinical teams via participation in the multidisciplinary Disease Specific
Research Groups (DSRG) and organizes Pan-Disease Investigator-Initiated Trial meetings to catalyze
interactions between DSRGs. As such, there were 4,070 accruals to interventional clinical trials during the last
funding cycle, of which 3,351 (82%) were therapeutic, including 1,144 (28%) investigator-initiated trials. Future
directions focused on the OSUCCC research priorities and cancers relevant to our catchment area and growth
in cellular and checkpoint inhibitor research (adult and pediatric), immunogenomics, tumor resistance and tumor
heterogeneity and small molecule drug development."
10770470,"PROJECT SUMMARY - COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE)
The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) is a national and international leader in
translational research, with a reputation for delivering high-quality patient care and effective outreach and
education programs to residents of the state of Ohio - our catchment area (CA) - and beyond. The CA includes
all 88 counties in Ohio, which have very diverse populations, with many underserved communities as well as
urban, rural and Appalachian communities. Electra Paskett, PhD, MSPH (CC) Associate Director for Population
Science and Community Outreach and Director of the Center for Cancer Health Equity (CCHE) leads the
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) efforts for the OSUCCC. The CCHE is at the core of our COE
efforts supporting the OSUCCC mission to reduce cancer health disparities throughout the CA. The CCHE is co-
led by Darrell Gray II, MD, MPH, FACG (CC), who oversees the COE initiatives with the Clinical Trials Office to
improve the accrual of women and minorities to clinical trials. COE works in the CA to connect minority
populations to screening, outreach and engagement services. They also work with basic, clinical and population
science program leaders in the OSUCCC to cultivate interest in CA-focused research including working with the
Government Relations team and key faculty across the Center to pursue policy initiatives that address the cancer
burden. COE efforts are supported by two Community Advisory Boards (rural and urban) that inform the focus
and scope of CCHE activities and provide ongoing feedback to the OSUCCC leadership and Program leaders.
The high priority cancers for the OSUCCC include lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, endometrial, cervical cancer,
thyroid, and leukemia, as well as tobacco use, obesity and HPV vaccination. OSUCCC research and/or outreach
and engagement efforts are ongoing to address these priority areas, via partnerships between the COE,
OSUCCC research program members, and the community. To assess the impact of COE and OSUCCC efforts
we have developed a logic model that includes short-term metrics of COE success: expanded reach (community
members, patients); impact (services provided, time to diagnosis); collaborations (community partners,
researchers); initiatives (grants funded); and clinical trial accrual (especially of underrepresented populations);
and long-term metrics success including: reduced prevalence of risk factors and cancer rates, and longevity and
impact of community partnerships. Over the last five years, we have had significant impact on HPV vaccination
rates, accrual of minorities to clinical trials, breast cancer detection rates, navigation to screening and treatment,
implementing translation for non-English speaking patients, fostering research to address the cancer burden in
the CA. COE future plans focus on the priority cancers/risk behaviors of the OSUCCC as well as on 1) ensuring
adequate communication between the community and the OSUCCC researchers as it relates to addressing the
cancer burden in the catchment area and 2) a focus across the lifespan and expand to populations we are just
beginning to work with (Asian, pediatric, rural clinics, LGBTQ) in order to reduce the cancer burden in our CA."
10770476,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
The OSUCCC has provided seed funding for faculty recruitment and shared resource development. During the
current grant cycle, 17 faculty were recruited, 8 of which were at the associate or full professor level. These
faculty were strategically recruited to all 5 research programs and most focus on research relevant to the
OSUCCC catchment area. They span 5 different colleges, 10 different departments across the colleges, and
include Nationwide Children’s Hospital. Developmental funds used to support these faculty was $1,937,467.
These investigators received $32,567,789 in NCI funding and $35,813,889 total peer-review funding, yielding a
return on investment from CCSG developmental funds of 18:1. For the current funding cycle, we also established
two developing shared resources (permitted under the prior CCSG guidelines), which were the Solid Tumor
Translational developing Shared Resource (STTdSR) and the Veterinary Clinical Research Support Developing
Shared Resource (VCRSdSR). The STTdSR has matured and is now called the Clinical-Translational Science
Shared Resource (CTSSR) to reflect more broad use to include investigators focused on hematological
malignancies and population science, in addition to those doing solid tumor research. Funding for this shared
resource is requested in the current CCSG application. The VCRSdSR remains a developing shared resource;
however, this will be supported from institutional funds and no CCSG funding is requested. The Specific Aims
for Developmental Funds are: 1) to expand innovative and high-impact science focused on our four strategic
priorities: immuno-oncology, cancer engineering, translational genomics, and cancer prevention and
survivorship; 2) to identify and recruit senior, midlevel and early career faculty whose scientific expertise targets
relevant needs in the OSUCCC strategic plan and catchment area (CA); and, 3) to use a robust evaluation
process and provide seed funding for research projects that are inter-programmatic collaborations and/or are
community focused, leading to NCI funding at the R01- or P01-equivalent level. To achieve these aims, for the
current application, funds are being requested for the recruitment of investigators (n=18) matched to the
OSUCCC research priorities and programmatic and catchment area needs. The OSUCCC also is requesting
funding to leverage our highly successful Pelotonia-funded pilot awards program, called the Intramural Research
Program. This is an externally peer reviewed mechanism that prioritizes projects for funding based on scientific
merit and research focused on our catchment area, with additional consideration for early stage investigators.
CSSG pilot funding will specifically target synergistic projects spanning two or more research programs
representing inter-programmatic collaborations, and/or or projects developing community partnerships (funding
for new shared resources are requested in the Shared Resource Management budget). Developmental funds
and the CCSG review process are a critical way that our university evaluates the impact of the OSUCCC and
allows us to substantially leverage our ongoing and substantial institutional commitments."
10770482,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SHARED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) manages and supports 16 CCSG-funded
Shared Resources (SRs) and is proposing two developing shared resources in this application. The goals of the
OSUCCC SRs are to support OSUCCC members by providing specialized technologies, services, and expertise
that maximize quality and speed of service, while maintaining cost-effectiveness and quality control. The SRs
support all five Research Programs and are managed by faculty from seven different colleges and Nationwide
Children’s Hospital. Most of the SRs are centrally located and in close proximity to OSUCCC members. The
Specific Aims for Shared Resource Management are to: 1) evaluate for need, and establish new specialized
technologies, services and expertise that enhance scientific interaction and productivity; 2) ensure that the SRs
provide cost-effective, reliable, and quality-controlled technologies, services and expertise; 3) support SRs
through budget planning, laboratory management systems, and sustainability; and 4) establish policies for SR
access and use. The OSUCCC directly manages 13 of the 16 SRs, and the others are jointly managed as
institutional SRs that follow NCI policies. Reporting to the OSUCCC Director, the SRs are led by Sharyn Baker,
PharmD, PhD, Associate Director for Shared Resources. Dr. Baker works with Heather Hampel MS, LGC,
Associate Director for Biospecimen Research for integration of biospecimen services with the SRs. Dr. Baker
leads the Shared Resource Team Leader (SRTL) committee that oversees SR management and implementation
of the scientific vision. The SRTL monitors quality and user satisfaction through user surveys and user
committees. SR development and evaluation is provided to Dr. Baker from the Associate Directors Committee,
Program Leaders, and the External Scientific Advisory Board. Shared Resource Management operations include
ensuring compliance with OSUCCC policies (prioritization of use and access, budgets, billing, and quality control)
and compliance with OSU Office of Research policies and the federal Uniform Guidance. For the evaluation of
new instrumentation and services, Dr. Baker manages the Intramural Research Program (IRP) that provides
external peer review of SR applications, evaluating scientific merit and planned usage ($3.4M awarded this grant
cycle. Overall support to the SRs over the last grant cycle has been $18M, allowing for all of the SRs to have
been enhanced and offer new services. Future plans for each SR are accounting for planned increased usage
due to the OSUCCC strategic research priorities and planned recruitment. The OSUCCC provides over $9M in
overall support of the SRs annually, The OSUCCC is requesting a total of $1,971,340 in CCSG funding, 8.9%
of the total support."
10770485,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION
Raphael Pollock, MD, PhD serves as Director for The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center
(OSUCCC). Dr. Pollock is assisted by a Senior Leadership team of nationally recognized leaders in cancer
research, clinical care, and prevention and education includes Peter Shields, MD (Deputy Director); William
Carson, MD (Associate Director for Clinical Research); Electra Paskett, PhD (Associate Director for Population
Sciences and Community Outreach); Patrick Green, PhD (Associate Director for Basic Science); Claire
Verschraegen, MD (Associate Director for Translational Science); Heather Hampel, MS, LGC (Associate Director
for Biospecimen Research); Sharyn Baker, PharmD, PhD (Associate Director for Shared Resources); Lawrence
Kirschner, MD, PhD (Associate Director for Education and Training); John Byrd, MD (Senior Advisor) and David
Gosky, MA, MBA (Executive Director for Administration). This highly experienced Senior Leadership team works
together to: ensure consistency in the shared vision and goals of the OSUCCC; foster synergistic and highly
collaborative interactions among the basic, population, translational and clinical research components of the
OSUCCC; effectively leverage all available resources at OSU, state and national levels; engage in clinical trials,
community outreach, education and mentoring; and oversee all activities of the OSUCCC. Continuous planning
and evaluation are key to the development and sustained excellence of the OSUCCC, and helps ensure its
strong scientific trajectory. Planning and evaluation by the OSUCCC External Scientific and Internal Advisory
Boards (ESAB and IAB, respectively), the Associate Directors Committee (ADC), and other councils provide the
Director and Senior Leadership ongoing guidance and support. The ESAB is the primary external mechanism
for objective review and oversight of the OSUCCC, including its progress in basic, translational, population and
community research, and its leadership and strategic direction. The ADC, Program Leaders Committee, Shared
Resource Team Leaders Committee, and IAB (composed of OSU deans and associate deans of research)
facilitate internal planning and evaluation. The Executive Council is responsible for the cohesive vision of cancer
research and clinical programs of the OSUCCC-James and provides another important internal mechanism for
planning and evaluation. Dr. Pollock and the Senior Leadership recently created the OSUCCC-James strategic
plan for the next five years, building upon existing strong foundations. The overarching goal of the new plan,
entitled Ascending to New Heights, is to drive new discoveries that transform cancer care across the continuum
of prevention, treatment and survivorship to improve the health of the OSUCCC catchment area communities.
Goals supporting research across the lifespan are informed by data about the cancer burden in the catchment
area and through bidirectional communication with community advisory boards. Four major research initiatives
(immuno-oncology, cancer engineering, translational genomics, and cancer prevention and survivorship) in the
plan will accelerate our vision of creating a cancer-free world, one person, one discovery at a time."
10770489,"PROJECT SUMMARY - CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM). CPDM facilitates all clinical cancer research at The
Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) and is responsible for 14,996 interventional
(5,648 interventional therapeutic) accruals over the reporting period. The CPDM has three major components:
the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), the Quality Assurance (QA) Office and the OSUCCC Data and Safety Monitoring
Plan (DSMP). Oversight is provided by the Associate Director for Clinical Research (ADCR), William Carson,
MD, who also is serving as the interim CTO Medical Director. Dr. Carson supervises the CTO Administrative
Director, Angela Campbell, MS, assisted by the Executive Director for Administration, David Gosky, MA, MBA.
The CTO provides investigators with centralized expertise and support for the implementation, coordination and
execution of cancer clinical trials. The CTO staff focuses on OSUCCC’s mission, vision and values to support
investigators in the highest quality clinical cancer research with adherence to all federal and state guidelines.
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring. All cancer clinical trials conducted by OSUCCC investigators include
oversight of data and safety monitoring. The OSUCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), approved by
the NCI and last revised August 1, 2018, provides guidance for the conduct of cancer clinical trials in accordance
with NCI CCSG requirements. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), chaired by Beth Christian,
MD, assures patient safety and protocol compliance by OSUCCC investigators and staff, and has monitored 413
trials during the reporting period. The independent control function for OSUCCC studies is provided by the
Quality Assurance Oversight Committee (QAOC), which has audited 180 trials over the reporting period.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research. OSUCCC leadership, investigators and
staff are committed to the inclusion of women and minorities in cancer clinical trials. Oversight of the inclusion of
diverse populations in cancer clinical trials is the responsibility of Dr. Carson, who is assisted by Electra Paskett,
PhD, Associate Director for Population Sciences and Community Outreach and Director of the Center for Cancer
Health Equity (CCHE). Outreach to women and minorities is led by CCHE staff who educate the community
about OSUCCC programs, services and the value of clinical trials.
Part IV: Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research. The inclusion of individuals
across the lifespan in cancer clinical research is an important goal of the OSUCCC. Nationwide Children’s
Hospital (NCH) is the pediatric arm of the OSUCCC and is committed to making clinical trials available to children
with a cancer diagnosis. It is the policy of the OSUCCC that individuals of all ages, including children and older
adults are included in cancer clinical trials. In summary, the OSUCCC facilitates clinical cancer research, and
provides quality, safety and monitoring of all trials with an emphasis on the inclusion of women, minorities, other
underserved populations and individuals across the lifespan in its catchment area (the State of Ohio)."
10770496,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer
Center (OSUCCC) consists of a Clinical Scientific Review Committee (CSRC) that reviews all new cancer-related
clinical protocols for scientific merit prior to Cancer Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission and monitors
the scientific progress of ongoing studies including accrual rates. The main CSRC is organized into two teams
(with highly similar composition) that collectively meet twice monthly (each once per month), facilitating rapid
protocol review. The CSRC consists of 49 members representative of all five OSUCCC research Programs and
includes clinical and basic researchers, biostatisticians, and pharmacists. Additionally, ad-hoc members with
specific expertise in the areas of cancer prevention and control as well as pediatrics are convened as CSRC
sub-committees to provide focused review of these protocols. The CSRC performs full scientific reviews of all
cancer-related clinical protocols initiated by local investigators or pharmaceutical industry sponsors, and
acknowledges NIH peer-reviewed studies. A quorum (50% of members) and appropriate reviewer expertise must
be present to conduct CSRC business. CSRC approval of a protocol is required prior to its review by the OSU
Cancer IRB. Each protocol is reviewed by four CSRC members (a primary reviewer, a secondary reviewer, a
biostatistician, and a pharmacist). Reviewers follow a written review template including analysis of the scientific
hypothesis and rationale, experimental design, patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, treatment plan, statistical
plan, data and safety monitoring plan, pharmacy considerations, accrual of underserved populations and patients
across the lifespan, and proper prioritization. The CSRC Executive Committee (EC) provides oversight to the
CSRC. The EC consists of 11 CSRC members that meet monthly to review protocol accrual and scientific
progress and ensure that protocol prioritization rules are followed. The CSRC EC is responsible for
communication with investigators whose clinical trials are not meeting accrual goals and for providing support to
facilitate accrual. The CSRC adheres to well-defined criteria for accrual monitoring and trial prioritization.
Ongoing studies that do not show adequate accrual or fail to meet accepted standards of quality control based
on formal audits are terminated. In 2019, the CSRC closed 12 trials for low accrual. The average time from
CSRC review to date of approval is 26 days. The EC performs expedited reviews for appropriate studies (e.g.,
retrospective studies requesting access to medical records). In the last grant period, 1,070 new interventional
protocols were reviewed by the CSRC with the following dispositions: 297 (28%) were approved as written, 345
(32%) were approved with stipulations, 76 (7%) were deferred, 297 (28%) were administratively acknowledged
after having undergone previous NIH peer-review and 55 (5%) were disapproved. 462 non-interventional
protocols were also approved by the CSRC. The CSRC receives protocols that have been reviewed and
prioritized by one of the Disease Specific Research Groups that provide a first stage of scientific review."
10770498,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOINFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE (BISR)
The BISR is an essential shared resource that supports a wide range of studies with bioinformatics and
computational biology needs, ranging from next generation sequencing (NGS) to data management in population
science studies. Housed within the Department of BMI, the BISR's goal is to leverage a variety of informatics
services, ranging from analysis of omics datasets to patient/participant-centered data instrumentation, access,
and management tools and processes. The Specific Aims of the BSR are to: 1) Provide state of the art
bioinformatics and computational biology services; and 2) Provide OSUCCC investigators with services,
expertise and access to technology platforms in support of heterogeneous and multi-dimensional biomedical
data management requirements. Over the current grant cycle, Drs. Kevin Coombes (TT) and Lang Li (CB)
assumed leadership of BISR, replacing Drs. Philip Payne and Jeffrey Parvin. During the current funding cycle, a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was established for the Department of Biomedical Informatics (BMI) and
the OSUCCC to support 5 faculty at 10% per year for 3 years within BISR as they transition to grant funding, on
a rolling basis, to provide non-chargeable, cancer focused bioinformatics work for OSUCCC membership and/or
cancer focused researchers. Additional major changes for BISR include supporting the enhancement of the
Genomics Shared Resource (GSR) to incorporate newly developed shared services with Nationwide Children's
Hospital (NCH); and added capabilities to support studies involving data from single-cell sequencing, long-read
(third generation) sequencing, metabolomics, and metagenomics. BISR has added five new faculty to support
the areas of (1) computational optimization for drug sensitivity prediction (Cheng), (2) proteomics, and functional
annotation of DNA non-coding regions (Zhang), (3) metabolomics and metagenomics (Mathe), (4) single-cell
sequencing (Ma), and (5) long-read sequencing (Au). BISR supported Biospecimen Services Shared Resource
(BSSR) projects (Total Cancer Care [TCC] and the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network [ORIEN])
by establishing a data warehouse of patient records with de-identified data. During the current funding cycle, the
BISR supported 115 publications (25 > 10 impact factor), 134 users, and 32 NCI grants including 5 P01s, 2 P50s,
13 R01s, 3 R21s, 1 R50, 2 U01s, 1 U10, 1 UG1, involving members from all five programs. Over the next grant
cycle, BISR will enhance services for “integromics”, e.g., the integration of disparate source of both omics and
clinical data. BISR will be a critical part of the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform (IMDP), an overarching
approach for fostering interactions among shared resources for complex immuno-oncology projects. The annual
budget of the BISR is $1,122,279, yet the CCSG request is $106,905. As such, the BISR leverages extensive
institutional support and seeks only 9.5% support from CCSG funds."
10770503,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOSPECIMEN SERVICES SHARED RESOURCE (BSSR)
The mission of the BSSR is to support innovative translational research to advance the prevention, diagnosis,
and treatment of cancer through the provision of biospecimens and clinical data. The Specific Aims are to: 1)
collect data and specimens from OSUCCC cancer patients using the IRB-approved Total Cancer Care (TCC)
universal consenting and biobanking protocol for future unspecified research; 2) prospectively procure
biospecimens for specific IRB-approved protocols; and 3) provide high quality, centralized biorepository services
for IRB-approved, grant-funded and large institutional projects in a CAP-accredited biorepository. Over the
current grant cycle, the major changes for the BSSR include: a) implementation of TCC across all Disease
Specific Research Groups (DSRGs) covering all cancers - TCC now includes 57,256 consented subjects
resulting in regular usage of biospecimens and data; and, b) the ORIEN AVATAR program was initiated,
providing OSUCCC members with research grade next generation exome sequencing results on tumor and
normal tissue with clinical annotation from 3,049 TCC subjects at OSU and 11,500 across ORIEN (the OSUCCC
is a major contributor of samples). During the current grant cycle, the BSSR provided key services in support of
122 publications (35 > 10 impact factor), 105 users, and 24 NCI grants, including 1 K01, 1 K12, 2 P01s, 2 P50s,
11 R01s, 4 R21s, 1 U10, 1 UH2, and 1 UM1. Over the next grant cycle, BSSR will contribute to each of the new
strategic priorities for the OSUCCC by providing biospecimens and high quality genomic and clinical data as
requested by immuno-oncology, translational genomics, cancer engineering and cancer prevention and
survivorship investigators. Each area will be supported by the TCC, and given the robust faculty recruitment and
regularly increasing patient volumes; there will be an increase in prospective procurement and biobanking as
well. Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment and increasing patient volumes, demand for services and new
technologies will increase. The BBSR will expand its staff, instrumentation and services before capacity is
reached. The annual budget of the BSSR is $2,206,277, yet the CCSG request is $179,168. As such, The BSSR
leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 8.1% support from CCSG funds."
10770506,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOSTATISTICS SHARED RESOURCE (BSR)
The BSR provides a centralized resource of expertise in the biostatistical and design aspects of
clinical/translational, basic, and population-based cancer research. The specific aims of the BSR are to: 1)
collaborate with OSUCCC investigators in all aspects of quantitative translational research including study
design, training and education, reproducibility and scientific rigor, statistical analysis, data visualization, and
manuscript and report preparation; 2) enable strong and consistent collaborations by providing a biostatistical
“navigator” to all OSUCCC research programs and Disease Specific Research Groups (DSRGs), and by
providing education and biostatistical training to OSUCCC members; and 3) provide biostatistical and
methodological review of all cancer protocols submitted to the OSUCCC Clinical Scientific Review Committee
(CSRC) and Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and as needed for the Total Cancer Care (TCC)
research committee for the BSSR. To bolster team science in cancer research, BSR established a navigator-
system in 2013, now expanded over the current cycle to 20 different groups at OSU and Nationwide Children's
Hospital (NCH), whereby biostatisticians are embedded within each DSRG and are involved with all research
studies from their inception. Navigators are intimately familiar with the clinical, biological, and statistical issues
they support and serve as point persons for establishing collaborations between these groups and the broader
OSU community. Office hours were established within all five OSUCCC programs, where the navigator
biostatistician spends half a day every other week at a provided space. BSR also actively developed workshops,
seminars, and courses devoted to training biomedical investigators in the fundamentals of design, analysis, and
scientific rigor. Over the current cycle, BSR supported individual investigators using genomic data from the TCC
protocol, the Oncology Research Information Exchange Network (ORIEN) Avatar program at OSU, and the
National Patient-Centered Research Clinical Network (PaTH) by providing computational and programming
support, data visualization, graphical and query tools, and data interpretation. BSR works together with other
shared resources and the DSMC and CSRC in the development and implementation of protocols to ensure
HIPAA compliant processes, and high data quality by enforcing the application of Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guidelines. During the current cycle, the BSR supported 405 publications
(59 > 10 impact factor) and 98 NIH (53 NCI) grants including 26 R01s, 35 R21s, 1 R03, 14 U01s, 5 U24s, 3
U19s, 3 U54s, 8 P01s, 2 P30s, 1 P50. Over the next grant cycle, the BSR's role in the new strategic priorities for
the OSUCCC, including immuno-oncology, translational genomics, cancer engineering and cancer prevention
and survivorship will substantially increase the BSR's contributions, and will specifically include new recruits and
technologies. The annual budget of the BSR is $4,063,515, yet the CCSG request is $231,260. As such, the
BSR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 5.7% support from CCSG funds."
10770509,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL-TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE SHARED RESOURCE (CTSSR)
The goal of the CTSSR is to foster the clinical-translational mission of OSUCCC members without wet-
laboratories by providing support and short-term needs for correlative science and other testable hypotheses.
The CTSSR is a consultative project management and central laboratory service that was developed with a
focus on investigator-initiated solid tumor clinical trials, but now supports all types of dry laboratory researchers
(hematological malignancy and population scientists). During the current funding cycle, the CTSSR, formerly
known as the Solid Tumor Translational developing Shared Resource (SR) was funded through CCSG
development funds, and is now being proposed as a full CCSG SR. The Specific Aims of the CTSSR are to: 1)
provide project design and project management support (including navigation, protocol development, grant
application and manuscript preparation) for studies that utilize resources available through other OSUCCC SRs,
investigator laboratories, and outside vendors; 2) provide specific laboratory services and sample processing
support for clinical translational research; and, 3) develop and rigorously perform customized laboratory assays
to meet the short-term needs of clinical investigators for a specific protocol, a specified time, or a specified
number of patient samples. Conveniently located within the Biomedical Research Tower, the CTSSR is
accessible to most OSUCCC clinicians and tissue procurement services. Major equipment includes a cell culture
facility, a QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System-Bio Rad and a Promega Maxwell RSC for high throughput nucleic
acid purification, and a Luminex Magpix for multiplex protein assays. During the current grant period, the CTSSR
has supported 94 investigators (62% OSUCCC members), and provided 8,223 hours of service and processed
3,602 samples (82.9% to OSUCCC members). The CTSSR provided services in support of 72 publications (14
> 10 impact factor), 94 users, and 9 NCI grants, including 1 K01, 2 P01s, 1 P50, 4 R01s, and 1 R03. The CTSSR
currently supports 20 ongoing trials and there are 8 new ones in the pipeline (spanning all five programs). It is
anticipated that the CTSSR will expand rapidly due to the continued rapid growth of the OSUCCC with its
strategic priorities. Specific future plans include participating in the developing Immune Monitoring and Discovery
Platform, fostering interactions with other shared resources for immuno-oncology projects; increase support for
hematologic and population science studies; establish a cell culture facility to enable preclinical cancer cell
culture studies (including drug synergy) needed as pilot data for human studies applications; and provide
multiplex protein arrays for human studies using whole cells, cell/tumor extracts and other biological fluids. The
annual budget of the CTSSR is $552,510, yet the CCSG request is $60,723. As such, The CTSSR leverages
extensive institutional support and seeks only 11% support from CCSG funds."
10770512,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL TREATMENT UNIT (CTU) AND CLINICAL TRIALS PROCESSING
LABORATORY (CTPL) SHARED RESOURCE (CTU/CTPL-SR)
An important scientific mission of the OSUCCC is to conduct high quality, cutting edge clinical research for the
improved understanding and advancement in treatments of human malignancies. The CTU/CTPL-SR is
composed of two different, but intimately related units, namely the Clinical Treatment Unit (CTU) and the Clinical
Trials Processing Laboratory (CTPL). The CCSG will only support the CTPL component of the shared resource;
support of the CTU component will be entirely from OSUCCC institutional funding, as has been the case for the
last two CCSG cycles. The CTU/STPL-SR manages all clinical trial biospecimen collection and processing for
samples that are sent externally, and for most clinical trials where samples are being sent to OSUCCC
investigator laboratories or shared resources. Key services, in support of all clinical trials needing biospecimen
collection, processing and shipping for the CTU/CTPL-SR include consultation on protocol design with regard to
correlative specimens, procurement and processing of correlative specimens per protocol specifications
developing protocol in-service materials, participating in site initiation visits and protocol implementation
meetings, assisting in monitoring visits and audits and shipping specimens internal or external to OSU for
analysis. The CTU/CTPL-SR coordinates with other shared resources and departments to address the wide
array of biological specimens required for current clinical trials. The Specific Aims are to: 1) provide a stable,
reliable, and cost-effective, state-of-the art unit for conducting early phase clinical trials requiring intense
monitoring and/or complex correlative specimen collection; and, 2) provide high-quality, high-volume specimen
processing, short-term storage and distribution of biospecimens collected as correlative components of phase I,
II and III translational clinical trials. During the current grant period, the CTU/CTP-SR has supported 129
investigators (60% OSUCCC members) from all five OSUCCC research programs, and procured a total of
104,831 specimens from patients enrolled in 729 clinical trials. Also, the CTU/CTPL-SR contributed to 102
publications (36 > 10 impact factor). The CTU/CTPL-SR will continue to be an essential shared resource to
facilitate high-quality translational research within the OSUCCC, especially given the current growth plans that
include: a) recruitment for both immuno-oncology (Pelotonia Institute of Immuno-Oncology) and translational
genomics; and b) commitments to medical oncology, hematology and gynecologic oncology for recruitments and
corresponding expectations for increased INDs and trial accruals. The annual budget of the CTU-CTPL-SR is
$1,104,344, yet the CCSG request is $126,251. As such, the CTU/CTPL-SR leverages extensive institutional
support and seeks only 11.4% support from CCSG funds."
10770517,"PROJECT SUMMARY – COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY & DIGITAL IMAGING SHARED RESOURCE (CPDISR)
The CPDISR provides expert, readily available and affordable experimental pathology support to investigators
conducting research for understanding the development and treatment of cancer using preclinical animal models
and/or human tissues procured for translational research. During the current funding period, a recent major
development was the inclusion of complete histology services optimized for human tissues, as well as expanded
slide digitization and quantitative image analysis services for stained human and animal tissue slides. As a result,
Dr. Anil Parwani (MCC) has been named co-Director with Dr. Krista La Perle (CB), the name of the shared
resource (SR) has been changed to the Comparative Pathology & Digital Imaging Shared Resource, and the
Specific Aims have been modified accordingly. The Specific Aims are to: 1) provide consultative services to
OSUCCC investigators for optimal experimental design, sample submission and data analysis, and interactions
with other SRs; 2) provide support for preclinical efficacy and toxicity animal studies as well as translational
studies that utilize human tissues; and 3) perform digitization and quantitative image analysis of stained slides
from animal and human tissues. During the current 5-year grant cycle, a third board certified veterinary
pathologist and seven additional technical staff have been added to anticipate usage in conjunction with the
robust OSUCCC recruitment and strategic priorities. The CPDISR also acquired a Leica PELORIS 3 dual retort
tissue processor after successful peer-reviewed funding through the OSUCCC Intramural Research Program.
During this grant cycle, the CPDISR contributed to 84 publications (12 > 10 impact factor), 537 investigators,
and 57 NCI grants, including 1 K12, 1 K22, 1 K24, 5 P01s, 1 P50, 35 R01s, 7 R21s, 2 R35s, 1 T32, and 3 U01s
involving members of all five OSUCCC research programs. For the next grant cycle, the CPDISR will be a regular
member of the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform, an overarching shared resource initiative fostering
complex immuno-oncology projects. In addition, a major emphasis will be to continue to expand our available
menu of antibodies optimized for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization in tissues
of animal and human origin by various staining platforms, including multiplexing, according to the specific needs
of OSUCCC members. We will also increase our support of image analysis projects allowing machine learning
approaches to be developed with the center for cancer engineering; and continue to evaluate available open
source and commercial image analysis software platforms/modules to complement our Aperio and Visiopharm
software in order to quantify biomarkers in animal and human tissues. The annual budget of the CPDISR is
$1,863,254, yet the CCSG request is $107,366. As such, the CPDIR seeks only 5.8% budgetary support from
CCSG funds."
10770520,"PROJECT SUMMARY – FLOW CYTOMETRY SHARED RESOURCE (FCSR)
Flow cytometry services are critical for cancer research. Since flow cytometry instrumentation is expensive, and
typically requires significant technical expertise, a centralized resource is essential. The mission of the FCSR is
to support OSUCCC members and high-impact cancer research projects with high quality cell analysis and
sorting capabilities. The FCSR also provides training and regularly host technology-based seminars or
workshops to introduce new technology to OSUCCC members. The FCSR continues to strive to be a state-of-
the-art cell analysis laboratory that has the following Specific Aims to: 1) provide state-of-the-art equipment and
support for high-quality cancer research for OSUCCC members on a fee-for-service basis; 2) continuously work
with OSUCCC members to provide substantial technical expertise and training for state-of the-art cytometry
instruments to address fundamental questions in cancer research so that researchers can have 24-hour access
to flow cytometry instrumentation; and 3) introduce OSUCCC members to new instrumentation, technology and
methodologies being developed at the FCSR through a variety of educational outreach activities. The FCSR co-
Directors are Jeffrey Chalmers, (Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering), and recently appointed
co-Director, Kevin Weller, Associate Director of the Pelotonia Institute of Immuno-Oncology (PIIO) and
specifically to develop the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform, a cross-cutting shared-resource initiative
that integrates shared resources for complex immuno-oncology projects. Further, Dr. Gregory Behbehani (LR)
is a Faculty Advisor for the Helios mass cytometer (CyTOF) system. Over the current grant cycle, major changes
to the FCSR were to align with the establishment of the PIIO, which will result in a substantial increase in the
need for flow cytometry services. To address this need, new instrumentation was purchased including four new
instruments including a state-of-the-art Cytek Aurora flow cytometer and a Helios mass cytometer. During this
time period, the FCSR contributed to 231 publications (39 >10 impact factor), had 296 users with 34,118 hours
of service (83.7% to OSUCCC members), and supported 80 NCI grants (1 K12, 1 K22, 1 K24, 6 P01s, 1 P50,
52 R01s, 1 R03, 7 R21s, 3 R35s, 1 R37, 1 T32, and 5 U01s). In the next funding cycle, the FCSR will support
the increasing needs of all OSUCCC strategic priorities, including immuno-oncology, translational genomics,
cancer engineering, and cancer prevention and survivorship. The user base will substantially increased requiring
new staff and technologies, for example by purchasing an additional Aurora instrument, and increasing cell
sorting, cell isolation, and exosome/microvesicle research. In addition, new services under development include
development of further exosome characterization and isolation technology. The annual budget of the FCSR is
$518,075, yet the CCSG request is $108,261. As such, the FCSR leverages extensive institutional support and
seeks only 20.9% support from CCSG funds."
10770523,"PROJECT SUMMARY – GENOMICS SHARED RESOURCE (GSR)
The mission of the GSR is to support OSUCCC members and high-impact cancer research projects with
genomics expertise, instrumentation and centralized resources to generate high-quality data. The GSR is a state-
of-the-art genomics laboratory that has substantially increased capacity through expansion to shared resources
at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. The GSR has the following Specific Aims: 1) sequence DNA and RNA
templates using both next generation sequencing platforms (i.e. Ilumina HiSeq4000 and NovaSeq6000) and
capillary Sanger sequencing and genotyping (via ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzers); 2) use sensitive molecular
hybridization methods to detect and quantify RNA transcript expression levels and structures such as splicing
and/or DNA copy numbers and variation, including digital (NanoString) and microarray (Affymetrix) platforms;
and 3) perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification to detect, quantify and confirm copy
number variants, single nucleotide variants, gene expression, and small insertion/deletion polymorphisms
including quantitative PCR (QuantStudio 12K flex) and high-throughput digital and custom PCR assay
(BiomarkHD and Juno) technologies. In 2018, the GSR partnered with the Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM)
at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) to expand our next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology services.
The GSR co-Directors are Drs. Amanda Toland (MCC) and Richard Wilson (CB). The GSR provides essential
genomics expertise and instrumentation to members of all five programs. During the current funding cycle, the
GSR contributed to 338 publications (63 > 10 impact factor) and 94 grants from members of all five programs.
We have been highly responsive to changing technology and user needs and, as a result, we now offer Sanger
sample pick-up, cell line verification, and single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing. We also regularly host technology-
based seminars or workshops to introduce new technology to OSUCCC members. With OSUCCC and
institutional support, we have expanded our facilities to improve sequencing capabilities and to include
nanofluidics liquid handlers and library preparation systems for sc-sequencing to provide state-of-the-art
resolution in cancer biology and response to therapy. In the next funding cycle, the GSR will support the
genomics needs of all OSU strategic priorities. Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment, demand for services and

10770525,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LEUKEMIA TISSUE BANK SHARED RESOURCE (LTBSR)
The LTBSR is a longstanding biobank, established in 1997, that procures, processes, and stores biologic
material from consenting patients with hematologic diseases. The LTBSR procures samples in two ways: 1) via
a general biobanking protocol for future research; and 2) via specific clinical research protocols with special
collection needs. The major services of the LTBSR are consenting patients, procuring samples (e.g., blood, bone
marrow, and leukapheresis products) as directed by the general or a specific IRB protocol, assessing sample
quality, providing fresh samples to investigators or processing them for storage, providing an oversight process
for use of samples and data, and delivering samples and data to approved recipients. Investigators receive
samples identified phenotypically or genetically, along with clinical data and available pathology data (including
standard of care immunophenotyping and genetic sequencing panels). During the current cycle, Dr. Lapo Alinari
(LR) replaced the prior LTBSR Director (David Lucas, who moved from Columbus), and Dr. Robert Baiocchi (LR)
replaced Dr. Clara Bloomfield (LR) as the Senior Faculty Advisor. The Specific Aims of the LTBSR are to: 1)
consent subjects and procure samples from patients with hematologic diseases; 2) uniformly process,
characterize and store biospecimens using state-of-the art procedures; and 3) provide biospecimens with
associated clinical, pathological and genomic data to OSUCCC researchers and to outside institutions so that
they can correlate findings from patient samples with clinical or population-based outcomes. Over the current
grant cycle, the LTBSR has supported 67 investigators (75% OSUCCC members) and all five of the OSUCCC
research programs, 45 publications (11 > 10 impact factor) and 19 NCI grants, including 1 K12, 1 K22, 1 K23, 1
P01, 13 R01s, and 2 R35s. The OSUCCC has recently made a commitment to substantially increase samples
obtained by lymph node sampling from lymphoma patients. In addition, the LTBSR has expanded services for
collecting discarded normal hipbone from replacement surgeries as a source of marrow stromal cells and
umbilical cord blood as a source of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. In the next funding cycle, the LTBSR will
continue to expand its breadth of tissue procurement services, addressing the OSUCCC research priorities of
immuno-oncology, translational genomics, and cancer prevention and survivorship. The annual budget of the
LTBSR is $664,631, yet the CCSG request is $70,451. Thus, the LTBSR leverages extensive institutional
support and seeks only 10.6% support from CCSG funds."
10770528,"PROJECT SUMMARY – MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY SHARED RESOURCE (MCSR)
The MCSR supports scientific endeavors of OSUCCC members to create chemical probes to disrupt molecular
pathways implicated in tumor growth, and to work with investigators to identify and create targeted agents against
novel therapeutic moieties selected for properties important for preclinical and clinical development. The MCSR
was established as a developing shared resource in 2011, and became a full CCSG shared resource in 2015.
The MCSR supports investigators conducting preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies by integrating the expertise
of multiple disciplines, including medicinal chemistry, process chemistry, computational chemistry, structural
biology and molecular pharmacology. Key services are custom synthesis and lead optimization, including
structure activity relationship analysis and structure-based optimization. Overall, the MCSR provides a crucial
niche service for investigators identifying new therapeutic compounds. The Specific Aims of the MCSR are: 1)
enable researchers to develop chemical probes of cancer biology; 2) Optimize hit and lead molecules through
the design and synthesis of analogs with improved drug-like properties for translational development as cancer
therapeutics; and 3) as a developing aim, enable screening of small molecules against proteins and whole-cell
assays to identify new compounds for further preclinical testing. For this Developing Aim, Dr. Blake Peterson
(TT) has been added as co-Director of the MCSR, and the OSUCCC will invest $3M in small molecule screening;
these new capabilities will require hiring additional staff and a technical director, purchasing of equipment to
conduct screens, and renovation of space. Over the current grant cycle, the MCSR supported 34 investigators
(79% OSUCCC members) from all five research programs, including members at Nationwide Children's Hospital,
and provided 7,625 hours of service (81.7% to OSUCCC members). The MCSR also contributed to 29
publications (9 > 10 impact factor), 34 users, and 7 NCI grants, including 1 K12, 1 U01, 1 R35, 1 R01, 2 P01s,
and 1 P50. Over the next grant cycle, the MCSR will directly support the OSUCCC's strategic priorities for
immuno-oncology and translational genomics. It will also support the development of drugs with potential for
cancer prevention. The major thrust for the MCSR will be to implement small molecule screening and build the
user base to identify novel compounds, and targets by phenotypic screening against cancer pathways, thereby
identifying mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression that are central to goals of CB and MCC. The annual
budget of the MCSR is $930,296, yet the CCSG request is $80,063. As such, the MCSR seeks only 8.6%

and consultation opportunities to OSUCCC researchers for improved sample preparation, imaging techniques
and image analysis; and, as a Developing Aim to provide OSUCCC members access to cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM). For this Developing Aim, the OSCUCC contributed to the purchase of two instruments with sub-
nanometer resolution of purified and cellular particles. During the five-year grant period, the MSR has supported
319 investigators (32% OSUCCC members), and provided 5,730 hours of service and 44,605 hours of
instrument time (33.3% of which was to OSUCCC members). The MSR contributed to 192 publications (32 > 10
impact factor) and 8 NCI grants (2 K22s, 1 P01, 1 P50, 8 R01s, and 1 U01). The MSR will support the microscopy
needs of all OSUCCC strategic priorities. Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment, demand for services and new
technologies will increase and capacity will be expanded. To align with immuno-oncology needs, the MSR will
be a regular member of the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform (IMDP), and two-photon microscopes
will be updated. Separately, the MSR is developing cryo-FIB capability for CET studies, and it will develop
correlative light and electron microscopy and real-time single molecule cellular imaging platforms in collaboration
with the GEdSR. Last, the MSR and GSR has been awarded a new grant to provide imaging capabilities that
supports cell enrichment and single cell sequencing. The MSR is supported by outstanding institutional
resources obtained by leveraging extensive partnerships with the OSUCCC, OSU Colleges, the OSU Office of
Research and grants from the State of Ohio, all totaling over $2M over the prior grant period. The annual budget
of the MSR is $697,706, yet the CCSG request is $82,192. As such, the MSR seeks only 11.8% budgetary

grants, including 1 P50, 3 R01s, 1 U19 and 1 U01, involving all five CCC programs. These efforts and
publications have contributed to defining biomarkers of exposure or intake, and provided novel insight into
phytochemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. More recently, NPASR has expanded into
targeted and untargeted metabolomics supporting our understanding of individual cancer risk due to tobacco
exposure, nutrients, specific foods, and dietary patterns. To meet future demands of OSUCC Investigators
aligned with OSUCCC strategic priorities, NPASR will further support, for example, studies of metabolomic-
microbiome interactions, genetic determinants of metabolism and tobacco use biomarkers. During the next grant
cycle, lipidomics and bioactive lipid analytic capabilities will be expanded to meet the needs of a growing user
base of all five programs. The NPASR provides a critical service for CCC members evaluating foods, nutrients

10824214,"Abstract
Anesthesiology is an interdisciplinary medical specialty requiring its practitioners to have a broad fund of
knowledge, including pharmacology, physiology, and engineering and the ability to apply this knowledge in
both controlled and emergency situations. In addition to providing trainees with exceptional clinical knowledge
and skills, the Anesthesiology Department as well as the larger academic community at the University of
California, San Diego (UCSD), provides a world-class environment for high quality training in research. Two
particular basic science research strengths at UCSD include the Departments of Pharmacology and
Engineering. Anesthesiologists including both basic scientists and clinicians have productive interactions and
collaborations with faculty in these two disciplines. Thus, the primary goal of this renewal T32 grant application
remains to train the next generation of clinician scientist in the Department of Anesthesiology to address
important questions in the discipline by leveraging the potential interdisciplinary training available in
collaboration with faculty in pharmacology and engineering. These interactions serve as guidance for our
fellows; however, fellows with their mentoring team have the ability to work beyond, within, and in larger
collaboratives to undertake research at the broadest level to involve as many disciplines necessary to
adequately address the questions asked. This goal will continue to be facilitated by approaching primary
questions in anesthesia with an interdisciplinary training focus; however, the program will remain flexible to
expand research scope as the interests of fellows develop. This training grant will provide post-graduate
trainees (MDs or MD/PhDs) with a 2-year research experience consisting of a broad focus on the basic
molecular mechanisms of drug action and/or exploration of a variety of engineering disciplines. Emphasis will
be on defining novel mechanisms of drug action for therapeutic interventions, applying engineering principles
to create devices, model physiology and pathophysiology using mathematical and theoretical approaches,
investigate biomaterials to facilitate non-invasive monitoring, and generation of biometric and blood derived
biological data, among other projects to enhance human health and the patient experience. To achieve this
overall goal, the training experience has two specific aims: i) expose fellows to a culture of science and
investigation present in the Department specifically and the campus broadly and ii) achieve competency in the
allied elements of a research career, e.g. experimental design, data analyses, presentations, manuscript
preparation and publication and how best to obtain research funding as well as lab management and job
interview skills. We strongly emphasize collegiality and ethics in the research environment. In achieving our
strong commitment to the development of the clinician scientist, our overriding mission is the training of the
next generation of clinician scientists who have the foundation of knowledge and fundamental tools coupled
with the passion and commitment to affect translational research."

Multi-Track Post-Baccalaureate Research Education (MT PREP)
The College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS) at Colorado State University (CSU) proposes to
create the first national Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) (R25) that will provide a unique training
opportunity in veterinary and translational medicine research that will enable recent baccalaureate science (BS)
graduates from underrepresented minority (URM), disabled and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds to
enter either a PhD or DVM/Ph.D. degree program. Data over the last 20 years from National Academy of Sciences,
National Institutes of Health, and other biomedical research organizations reveal an insufficient number of individuals
are being trained in translational medical science, despite the significant increase in job opportunities currently and in
the future. In particular, the lack of training opportunities for Under-represented individuals interested in STEM
severely limits the capacity to fill this national need. The proposed MT PREP will incorporate existing pre-doctorate
DVM research training program activities as well as Ph.D. training program elements with specific postbaccalaureate
activities to achieve the goals. Former postbaccs currently enrolled in graduate programs in CVMBS, trainees appointed
to our CSU IMSD T32 and DVM/PhD students will serve as peer mentors. Well-qualified faculty mentors with diverse
backgrounds and research disciplines, with over $15M in extramural funding, and demonstrated success in
undergraduate and graduate training, have been recruited to provide experiential research opportunities for trainees.
The goals of this program are to 1) recruit and support postbaccs from under-represented backgrounds with interest and
aptitude for foundational, translational and/or clinical research in our MT PREP , 2) develop MT postbaccs’ independent
critical reasoning, creative ideation, observation and rigorous experimental design and analytical skills, 3) provide faculty
and peer mentorship for these candidates to practice responsible and ethical conduct of research and develop and
implement their own mentoring philosophy and plan and 4) provide support to leverage postbacc’s PREP experience in
writing federal GRFP applications, PhD and DVM/PhD program applications and presentation of results. Our long-term
goal is to increase competitiveness of URMs for nationally recognized graduate programs and contribute to the talent
pool of well-trained biomedical URM scientists."
10746405,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The lymphatic vasculature plays a critical role in fluid homeostasis, removing cellular waste and immune
responses. Recent research has highlighted its integral contribution during the regenerative response after
cardiac injury. The central nervous system was until recently, believed to be immune privileged and lacking a
lymphatic system. Recent studies have revealed the lymphatic system extends into the mammalian and
zebrafish brain, however the role it plays in neurogenesis and the response to injury is unknown. The need to
better understand how to alleviate the detrimental responses to Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke and
promote regeneration is imperative in order to improve outcomes. This proposal aims to uncover the role of the
meningeal lymphatic system in adult neurogenesis and regeneration and the mechanisms through which it
contributes to generating new neurons during homeostasis and injury response.
 Previously, we have characterized the development of the zebrafish cardiac lymphatic system and
identified the signaling pathways that regulate its specification and formation. We then demonstrated that the
cardiac lymphatic vasculature expands post injury in the adult zebrafish heart. This work demonstrated that
lymphatic vessels respond to injury and aid the regenerative response by trafficking immune cells. By blocking
lymphangiogenesis we demonstrated that the lymphatic vasculature was required to promote regeneration and
prevent scarring of heart tissue. The discovery of the meningeal lymphatics led us to hypothesize that
meningeal lymphatics support adult neurogenesis and regenerative repair after injury by providing
neurotropic factors, controlling cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) composition and the immune response.
 To test this hypothesis, we will pursue two aims in the zebrafish as a model of adult neurogenesis and
brain regeneration. Aim 1 will characterize the lymphatic response to injury using time lapse imaging and
determine how disruption of the lymphatic system impacts adult neurogenesis. Using mass spectrometry, we
will analyze the composition of the CSF to identify lymphangiocrine factors that support neurogenesis. In Aim 2
we will manipulate the development of the meningeal lymphatic vasculature and use transcriptomic analyses to
determine the impact on immune cell populations and response.
 Pursuit of these hypotheses will open new avenues for investigation of lymphatic support of neurogenesis
in mammalian systems in health and after injury. In order to further our comprehension of adult neurogenesis,
the regenerative response of the nervous system and potential therapies forward it is critical to understand the
how the lymphatic system modulates the immune and environmental aspects of neurogenesis and regeneration."
10809581,"ABSTRACT
During a recent single cell RNA sequencing analysis of the developing human lung, we identified a cell
population characterized by a unique gene expression profile that has not previously been reported in the
human or mouse lung. These cells express SCGB3A2/SFTPB/CFTR, but lack markers for other well
characterized cell types such as club cells (SCGB1A1) or ionocytes (FOXI1). We refer to these as Fetal Airway
Secretory (FAS) cells given the expression of several secretory genes within the transcriptional signature.
Since nothing is known about FAS cells, and there is no analogous population in the murine lung, the
overarching goal of this proposal is to both describe these cells in detail, to interrogate their differentiation
potential, and to determine how these cells are regulated. By using an in vitro model of the developing human
lung epithelium called human Bud Tip Progenitor (BTP)-organoids, preliminary data shows that BTP-organoids
can give rise to both TP63+ progenitors and FAS cells during airway differentiation, and that this differentiation
can be modulated by TGFb/BMP/SMAD signaling. Single cell barcode-based lineage tracing during the
transition from BTP-to-airway suggest that clones of FAS cells or basal cells give rise to distinct subsets of
airway cells, with FAS cells giving rise to pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and a subset of C6+
multiciliated (MC) cells, while TP63+ progenitor cells give rise to secretory cells and MUC16+ MC cells. Based
on this data, we will test the overarching hypothesis that FAS cells differentiate distinct airway progenitor cell
that give rise to a subset of airway cell types. Given the novelty of this cell type, and the unique tools that we
have developed to assess the differentiating human epithelium in vitro, understanding this cell population will
provide foundational descriptive and mechanistic insights into human lung biology."

10745730,"Project Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is caused by impaired β-cell insulin secretion and reduced β-cell mass. Both features
have been linked to the failure to maintain β-cell identity. As a result, functional β-cell cells dedifferentiate into
non-functional endocrine progenitor-like cells. In this regard, whether β-cell dedifferentiation is reversible is one
of the most important notions in terms of disease modification. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 isoform A3
(ALHD1A3) has been discovered as a marker of β-cell dedifferentiation in diabetic mice and human T2D
pancreata. ALDH1A3-positive β (A+) cells have been shown to be functionally defective. Moreover, pair-fed
db/db mice showed improved glucose control associated with a significant decrease in the number of A+ b cells.
The strong correlation between ALDH1A3 expression and β-cell function suggests that ALDH1A3 is more than
a marker and may also plays a role in β-cell dedifferentiation during diabetes progression. Furthermore, it is
unknown whether the decrease in A+ cell number under pair-feeding was due to reversal to a normal b-cell
phenotype, death, or the emergence of new β cells. Answering these questions will provide clues on whether
and how β-cell failure can be reversed. Thus, the PI first established two animal models to address these queries:
one to investigate the role of ALDH1A3 in dedifferentiating β cells (β-cell specific Aldh1a3 knockout) and another
to investigate the fate of ALDH1A3-expressing (A+) cells during pair-feeding (ALDH1A3 Creert knock-in lineage-
tracing). The latter model will allow her to address whether A+ cells are converted back into ALDH1A3-negative
(A-) cells with restored β-cell function. To complement these models, the PI will also use selective chemical
ALDH1A3 inhibitors to see if ALDH1A3 blockade can reverse β-cell failure.
In this application, she will test the potential therapeutic effects of genetic and pharmacological ALDH1A3
inhibition in diabetes in vivo and its mechanism of action (Aim 1). Using an ALDH1A3 lineage tracing mouse
model, she will directly test the reversibility of β-cell dedifferentiation in diabetic mice in pair-fed condition, and
in the treatment with ALDH1A3 inhibitors, KOTX1 and GA11 (Aim 2).
The successful completion of this application will demonstrate the role of ALDH1A3 in β-cell function in the
pathophysiological process of T2D. More importantly, the proposed work will assess whether ALDH1A3 is a
potential therapeutic target in the treatment of T2D by reversing β-cell dedifferentiation/failure."
10766122,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aberrant epithelial reprogramming can take the form of metaplasia, characterized by the appearance of
mature cell types that are not normally present at the site of injury. In organ fibrosis, this often culminates
in a transformed barrier composed of matrix-laden scars and metaplastic epithelium. A pathognomonic
feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the ectopic appearance of KRT5+ basal cells in the
damaged alveolar compartment, the presence of which correlates with disease severity and survival. This
suggests that metaplasia is a clinically relevant feature of lung fibrosis, and understanding this pathologic
form of epithelial plasticity could present potential therapeutic targets. We have previously shown that
hedgehog (Hh)-activated mesenchyme contributes to components of the scar in fibrotic repair. We now
demonstrate that Hh-activated mesenchyme functionally interacts with airway progenitors to promote
metaplastic KRT5 differentiation in the fibrotic lung. Furthermore, we show that a Hh-BMP signaling
circuit in the airway progenitor niche regulates the metaplastic outcome during fibrotic repair. Our central
hypothesis is that mesenchymal Hh activation upregulates BMP antagonists in the progenitor niche,
which drives epithelial metaplasia in both human and mouse lungs, and this Hh-BMP circuit can be
targeted to mitigate and reverse metaplasia in lung fibrosis. Leveraging novel genetic/pharmacologic
tools we have developed, our single and bulk RNAseq bioinformatics capacity, and our access to human
samples, this proposal aims to address how the mesenchymal compartment of the progenitor niche
modifies epithelial plasticity in fibrotic repair, and outlines a potential pre-clinical pipeline to identify
compounds that can target epithelial metaplasia in lung fibrosis."
10805372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis is one of the most expensive medical conditions in the United States, with a considerable
amount of these costs being incurred during hospitalizations for acute flares. A substantial proportion of
ulcerative colitis patients hospitalized for acute flares will fail to respond to intravenous steroids and
require second line therapies such as biologics and/or colectomy, which can be associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Ulcerative colitis patients who are hospitalized or have recently been hospitalized
for acute flares are excluded from traditional phase 2 and 3 drug development trials because of how high
risk they are for progression to colectomy or re-admission. Novel, safe, and effective treatments are
needed to optimize outcomes in this high-risk orphan population. A hallmark of ulcerative colitis is chronic
intestinal mucosal hypoxia and inflammation, with an accompanying dysfunction in hypoxia response
pathways and preferential activation of pathogenic immune cells including neutrophils. Hyperbaric oxygen
therapy involves breathing 100% oxygen under increased atmospheric pressure to increase tissue
oxygenation. In a phase 2 trial program we demonstrated that this increased oxygenation of mucosal
tissue leads to improvements in disease activity in ulcerative colitis, reductions in inflammatory markers,
and prevention of progression to biologics or colectomy during hospitalizations for acute flares. In the
current proposal we aim to 1) confirm the impact of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on disease outcomes in
ulcerative colitis patients hospitalized for acute flares through a multi-center, double-blind, sham-
controlled, clinical trial. We further aim to explore the mechanisms through which hyperbaric oxygen
therapy improves disease activity by studying the hyperbaric oxygen specific effects on 2) neutrophils and
epithelial cells, and 3) the microbiome. Confirmation of treatment efficacy for hyperbaric oxygen therapy
would bring forward a novel therapy for a high-risk population of ulcerative colitis patients who are
traditionally excluded from traditional clinical trial programs, while also advancing our understanding of
disease pathogenesis and the interplay between hypoxia, the immune system, and the microbiome."
10795041,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2017, 2.5 million children died in the first month of life. An estimated 2 million of these deaths could have been
prevented by provision of essential newborn care at home and rapid identification of illness and care-seeking by
the caregiver. Community health volunteers (CHVs) are a large cadre of lay health workers whose role is to
promote access to preventative care and treatment in resource-limited settings. In Kenya, CHVs conduct monthly
home visits to pregnant and postpartum women to provide education and screen for complications. Several
counties in Kenya have adopted a digital community health toolkit (dCHT) that supports CHV workflow by
tracking clients, managing tasks, and guiding home visits. Standardized CHV home visits expand mothers’
access to information and support, however the concentrated risk of neonatal illness in the first weeks of
life and its potential to rapidly deteriorate mean that even monthly home visits leave mothers and
neonates in need of on-demand support.
Our team developed an interactive SMS text messaging intervention, Mobile WACh Neo (NEO), that connects
mothers with healthcare workers remotely in the high-risk period immediately following birth to improve maternal
and neonatal health. NEO sends automated, theory-based, actionable daily messages that systematically guide
mothers to evaluate neonatal danger signs, and facilitates real-time dialogue with a healthcare worker to triage
medical concerns and augment maternal social support.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to integrate NEO interactive SMS into the existing digital
infrastructure supporting CHV workflow in Western Kenya (dCHT) to enable remote communication by
mothers with CHVs between home visits. We propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Employ a human-
centered design approach to develop a NEO interactive SMS module in the dCHT, named CHV-NEO. Aim 2:
Evaluate CHV-NEO’s impact on neonatal mortality, clinic visit attendance, and caregiver provision of essential
newborn care (cord care, thermal care and initiation of breastfeeding), in a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial.
Aim 3: Determine the effect of CHV-NEO on CHV and supervisor workflow, and evaluate determinants of CHV-
NEO’s acceptability, adoption and fidelity of use. We hypothesize that this innovative strategy will be successfully
implemented within existing CHV infrastructure and will improve provision of at-home preventative care, increase
timely referral of neonatal illness to facilities, and reduce neonatal mortality.
CHV-NEO has potential to address a critical gap in efforts to improve neonatal health in resource-limited settings.
Completion of these aims will generate a ready-to-scale intervention and rigorous data on both its
effectiveness and the enablers of its successful implementation."
10775754,"The brain changes of Alzheimer disease (AD) start many years before the onset of cognitive symptoms. Most
models of AD propose a stepwise progression of brain pathology starting with amyloid plaque deposition, then

developed that allow detection of AD brain pathology in living individuals, but these modalities have significant
drawbacks that limit their widespread use. Over the last three years, there has been rapid development of
blood-based biomarkers that accurately detect AD brain pathology. In this study, we propose to study
some of the most promising blood-based biomarkers for three types of AD brain pathology: amyloid
(Aβ42/Aβ40), tau (phosphorylated tau [pTau] isoforms), and neurodegeneration (neurofilament light
chain protein [NfL]). The research team has developed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assays for
plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and pTau isoforms that will be further optimized and automated as part of the proposed
project. The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center cohort will be studied, and has available data on
plasma and CSF NfL, clinical dementia diagnosis, performance on cognitive tests, health history, amyloid PET,
tau PET, structural brain volumes by MRI, genetic markers, numerous CSF biomarker measures, discovery
proteomics data, and autopsy reports. Approximately 1,700 matched pairs of banked plasma and CSF
samples from ~1,000 individuals will be examined, which is similar in size to recent major studies of cognitive
outcomes as a function of biomarker combinations. The correlation of the blood-based measures with better
established CSF and imaging measures will be evaluated. Biomarkers of amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration
will be used independently and in combination within a modality (blood-based, CSF or imaging) to predict the
risk for current or future symptomatic AD. For all analyses, the effects of individual characteristics (including
age, sex, years of education, APOE ε4 genotype, polygenic risk score, race, and medical comorbidities) will be
evaluated to identify factors that modify the expression of symptoms associated with biomarker levels. We
hypothesize that the combination of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, pTau isoforms and NfL will perform better than
amyloid PET in predicting risk for current or future symptomatic AD. Because blood tests are well-accepted by
patients, physicians, and researchers, an accurate blood test for symptomatic AD would likely be widely used
and could be a game-changer in improving AD research, accelerating clinical trials and enabling more accurate
diagnoses in the clinic."

Immune modulation holds tremendous promise for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disease, metabolic
disease, and infectious disease. New ways to generate antigen-specific T and B cells inexpensively and with
minimal reactogenicity are badly needed. Certain bacterial strains from the gut microbiome elicit a potent,
specific adaptive immune response. The underlying mechanisms could guide new therapeutic strategies in
which bacteria-specific immune responses are rationally altered or re-directed. The gut is the site of a wide
variety of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. However previous papers have characterized
microbial strains of the microbiome under artificial conditions of mono-colonization. This approach can identify
strains that are capable of modulating immune cells, but it is unknown how a strain functions in the presence of
other members of the complex microbiota. This knowledge gap hinders a logical design of a microbial
therapeutic.
 My long-term research objective is to develop new technologies to understand the “physiological” gut
ecosystem at the level of molecular mechanisms so that I can identify immune modulatory bacteria from the
microbiome and build new therapeutics. In this proposal, I will establish a “physiological” gut by colonizing
germ-free mice with a complex defined gut community (104 strains) and profile T cell responses to each strain
individually. In Aim1, I will identify a set of bacteria-reactive TCRs and their stimulatory strain by single cell
technologies, so that I can provide a big picture of the strain-T-cell interactions at the single TCR level. In
Aim2, I will identify and characterize a bacterial antigen common to multiple strains. In Aim3, the result of T cell
profiling will be used to “design” therapeutic bacterial communities in which inflammatory strains will be
dropped out for building a tolerogenic community to treat colitis in an IBD mouse model. The successful
completion of this project will “decode” a strain-by-strain view of immune modulation by the gut microbiome
and provide a molecular basis for “designing” the new therapy that logically modulates immune response to
treat IBD and other devastating systemic disorders.
 Support from the K99 and mentors will complement my expertise in immunology with state-of-art
technologies in microbiology and single cell biology. I will accomplish this with training from Dr. Michael
Fischbach (primary mentor, bacterial genetics), Dr. Daniel Mucida (co-mentor, single-cell biology and T cell
biology), Dr. Justin Sonnenburg (advisory committee, metagenomic analysis), and Dr KC Huang, (advisory
committee, a synthetic microbial community). The training and mentorship I receive during my K99/R00 award
will provide a critical stepping stone for me to achieve my academic goal of establishing a vibrant independent
research program that can answer an important question in the gut ecosystem for establishing a new
therapeutic."
10746456,"The main objective in the field of psychiatry is to be able to treat patients at an individual level. To reach this goal
of precision medicine, large scale initiatives such as the RDoC have been developed to find new ways to parse
heterogeneity in psychiatric disorders. Their success has been slow partly due to a slow transition away from
case-control studies based on diagnoses and limitations due to small sample size. Therefore, there is a critical
need to find alternative solutions at an affordable cost. One strategy is to identify a complex behavior such as
Reinforcement Learning based decision making (RLDM) that is impaired across various psychiatric disorders
and adopt a computational framework to explain heterogeneity at an individual level. RLDM is a multifaceted
construct involving several sub-processes ranging from estimating values of different options in the environment
(valuation), accumulating evidence for these options (sequential sampling), choosing the best option (explore-
exploit behavior), estimating the outcome value (salience attribution) and lastly integrating relevant information
about outcomes and updating the value of stimuli (learning rate). These sub-processes can be quantified by
utilizing computational models. However, prior to building normative models of these RLDM constructs that can
be potentially utilized in clinical practice, it is critical to assess the reliability of these RLDM model-derived
parameters to avoid translational failures. Therefore, our main goals of this proposal are to (1) parse RLDM sub-
processes into mathematically-defined parameters in a large sample using a diverse set of tasks; (2) assess
test-retest reliability of these parameters; and finally (3) build normative models of the parameters and chart the
heterogeneity at the level of the individual. To achieve this goal, we will acquire behavioral data from six RL
tasks, including delay and effort discounting, probabilistic learning, virtual patch foraging, Pavlovian instrumental
transfer and approach-avoid conflict tasks. These tasks are each optimized to measure at least two of the RL
sub-processes separately. We will collect behavioral data and self-report assessments from a community sample
from 1000 participants (aged 18-85). To estimate test-retest reliability of RLDM parameters, we will invite 500
healthy participants from this sample to complete the session again in one week’s time. First, we will apply start-
of-art computational models to quantify RLDM behavior in each subject. Second, we will calculate the test-retest
reliability of these parameters. Third, we will build normative models to link each of the RLDM construct with age
and calculate each subject’s deviation from the norm. Lastly, we will conduct soft clustering on these deviations
to identify clusters and investigate their differences in psychopathology and general functioning."

Although somatic mosaicism is a known cause of malformations of cortical development (MCD), it is still difficult
to detect sparse somatic variants in patient tissue and study their molecular and functional effects. The long-
term goal of this project is to unravel the cellular and molecular complexity of MCD and translate this knowledge
into improved diagnostic and treatment opportunities for patients. The overall objectives in this application are to
(i) improve somatic variant detection, (ii) identify transcriptional correlates of somatic variants, and (iii) test
functional effects of somatic variants in relevant cell types. The central hypothesis is that somatic variants are
enriched in particular cell lineages in MCD and that cell identity is an important determinant of a variant’s
molecular and functional effects. The rationale for this project is that understanding somatic variation and its
consequences at cell-type resolution will ultimately improve gene discovery for MCD and help advance the field
toward targeted therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy associated with MCD. The central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Improve somatic variant detection in patients with focal cortical
malformations, (2) Evaluate cell-type-specific transcriptional effects of somatic mutations, and (3) Functionally
validate the cell-type-specific contribution of somatic mutations to disease features. Under the first aim, relevant
cell types will be enriched from affected patient tissue and sequenced as a strategy to improve somatic variant
detection. For the second aim, integrated single-nuclei genotyping and transcriptomic analyses of patient tissue
will be used to evaluate gene expression signatures of somatic mosaicism. The third aim will leverage a novel
transgenic mouse model of MCD to drive somatic variation in particular cell types and determine how cell identity
contributes to specific components of disease. The research proposed in this application is innovative because
it takes a new approach to gene discovery in MCD, leverages leading-edge techniques such as integrated single-
nuclei genotyping/transcriptomics, and takes advantage of a unique mouse model generated by the applicant’s
lab. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to yield new causal somatic variants for MCD
and new knowledge of their molecular and functional effects in appropriate cellular contexts. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential to provide new opportunities to develop or apply targeted treatments."

The past two decades of cancer research have identified one or more drivers for most human
malignancies. In addition, multiple cell death genes and pathways have been identified that
normally protect the organism against developmental mutations or defects in genomic
maintenance. These observations suggest that one might be able to rewire the transcriptional
circuitry to cause the cancer cell to kill itself with its own driver. We have invented a new class
of molecules that use Chemically Induced Proximity (CIP) to rewire the cancer cell such that the
cancer driver activates proapoptotic pathways. We call these molecules Transcriptional
Chemical Inducers of Proximity or TCIPs because they induce proximity or recruit a cancer
driver to the promoters of proapopotic genes. For development of these two-sided, “bifunctional”
molecules, we will focus on Diffuse Large Cell B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), using the master
inhibitor of cell death, BCL6, as an anchoring transcription factor on the promoters of
proapoptotic genes. For an activator we use any of several aberrantly-expressed transcription
or epigenetic activators, to simultaneously derepress and activate proapoptotic genes. We have
synthesized bifunctional small molecules that recruit transcriptional activators over-expressed in
DLBCL to the promoters of proapoptotic genes normally bound and repressed by BCL6. In our
preliminary studies, these molecules lead to rapid and robust killing of DLBCL that is superior to
the best-in-class inhibitors and also specific for cells that over-express the targets of the
bifunctional molecule. Using a strategy similar to genetic dominant gain-of-function mutations,
TCIP can engage cancers with multiple drivers, thereby going beyond conventional inhibitors
and degraders. Because bifunctional molecules rely on two separately overexpressed proteins,
TCIP takes advantage of the natural, fundamental basis of transcriptional specificity to provide
precise, predictable and selective killing of cancer cells. To further develop this approach, we
will first optimize these molecules for stability, solubility and specificity of killing of DLBCL.
Secondly, we will define the mechanism by which they produce robust and rapid killing. Finally,
we will test them in established PDX models. Our studies will involve a multidisciplinary
approach drawing on expertise in chemistry, clinical lymphoma treatment, cancer biology and
genomic biology. If successful, we will lay the foundation for a new concept in the treatment of
lymphoma, and more broadly, cancer chemotherapy, that is more specific than many existing
approaches. The use of a novel dominant gain-of-function strategy by TCIPs addresses the
issue of treatment of cancers, such as DLBCL, that have multiple, concurrent drivers."

SARS-CoV-2 infections in children are mostly milder and less lethal than in adults. This lower
incidence of relevant disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 has surprisingly also been observed
for children with asthma, the most common chronic respiratory and inflammatory disease in
children. As social distancing and masks have dramatically but temporarily decreased the
spread of common viral respiratory infections, this created the positive effect of a significant
decrease of viral-triggered asthma in children. The growing prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in children and the resurgence of non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral infections make it critical
and timely to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection shapes respiratory outcomes and immune
responses to other respiratory viruses and the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
In addition to a strong genetic predisposition, asthma is strongly linked to viral respiratory
infections, and infectious stimuli can have long-term epigenetic consequences that shape
immune responses to subsequent infections. We propose that a common genetic variation that
alters sphingolipid levels in children with asthma may also result in limited pathogenesis of
SARS-CoV-2 in children with asthma. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis is that common
genetic variation in asthma moderate age-dependent outcomes and immune responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines utilizing an NYC pediatric asthma cohort that was started
early in the pandemic. This cohort is uniquely suited to the hypothesis as it (1) includes children
of all ages with and without asthma; (2) is enriched for children from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic backgrounds associated with health disparities and high exposure to SARS-
CoV-2; and (3) has already enrolled more than three hundred with a high antibody positivity rate
since May 2020. The availability of detailed questionnaire data on asthma and SARS-CoV-2
exposure, biospecimen that include blood (including stored PBMC), and nasal samples will
enable us to address these three Specific Aims, to (1) determine the age-dependent effect of
SARS-CoV-2 infection on subsequent respiratory health in asthmatic children; (2) define the
epigenetic and transcriptomic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on hematopoietic stem cells,
and (3) define the effects of common genetic asthma risk alleles on responses to SARS-CoV-2
infection of nasal epithelial cells and subsequent infection with respiratory syncytial virus and
rhinovirus. These studies will be supported by a team with expertise in viral immunology,
pediatric asthma, and epigenetics of immune responses and will inform on age- and disease-
specific impact and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory viruses in children."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with
liver fibrosis as the most important predictor of morbidity and mortality in NASH. However, due to the major gaps
in understanding the mechanisms of NASH progression, particularly fibrosis, there are no FDA-approved drugs
to treat NASH and halt the progression of NASH to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Emerging evidence
shows that excessive cholesterol accumulation in hepatocytes promotes liver fibrosis in NASH, but how hepatic
cholesterol homeostasis is disrupted during NASH is not completely understood. Human genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have indicated that EH domain binding protein 1 (EHBP1) is associated with low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human livers has
revealed that EHBP1 expression is dramatically reduced in hepatocytes from cirrhotic livers with advanced
fibrosis, indicating that hepatocyte EHBP1 may play a role in liver fibrosis through modulating cholesterol
metabolism. The overall objective of this proposal is to study the role and the regulation of EHBP1 in NASH. Our
studies with primary human and mouse hepatocytes showed that EHBP1 deficiency enhances LDL receptor
(LDLR), cellular cholesterol, and the Hippo pathway effector TAZ, a novel cholesterol sensor that can induce
liver fibrosis in NASH. We further found that hepatocyte-specific silencing of EHBP1 induces liver LDLR,
cholesterol, TAZ, and liver fibrosis in NASH mice. We recently published that hepatic cholesterol stabilizes TAZ,
and therefore propose that hepatocyte EHBP1 reduces liver fibrosis by preventing cholesterol accumulation and
suppressing TAZ in NASH (Aim 1). Our study supports a role of EHBP1 in cholesterol homeostasis to prevent
liver fibrosis in NASH. However, as NASH progresses, EHBP1 expression is reduced. Surprisingly, we found
that the NASH-relevant inflammatory cytokine TNFa significantly suppresses the expression of EHBP1 and
PPARa, a predicted transcriptional regulator of EHBP1, in primary hepatocytes. Hence, we propose that
inflammatory stress caused by TNFa disturbs cholesterol homeostasis by suppressing PPARa/EHBP1
expression in hepatocytes during NASH (Aim 2). We further found that TNFa-suppressed EHBP1 can be blocked
by treatment with resolvin D1 (RvD1), a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)–derived specialized pro-resolving
mediator (SPM) that can trigger resolution of inflammation. As RvD1 is produced by macrophages, we propose
that macrophage-derived RvD1 blocks TNFa-mediated EHBP1 suppression in hepatocytes and this RvD1-
mediated cellular crosstalk maintains cholesterol homeostasis and prevents fibrosis in NASH (Aim 3). As the
beneficial effects of SPM analogues have been tested in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases, our study
elucidating the crosstalk between inflammation resolution and cholesterol homeostasis will provide insights on
the potential use of RvD1 analogues as an innovative therapeutic strategy for NASH."

Shoulder pain and joint disease is a serious threat to health and mobility for manual wheelchair users living with
spinal cord injury. There are subsequent implications for functional independence, quality of life, caregiver
burden, and healthcare utilization. In particular, rotator cuff tears are devastating for these individuals as the
usual clinical course (repair) is not typically viable. Their upper extremities have become their primary means of
mobility, and post-surgical shoulder immobilization is impractical. As such, it is critical that shoulder joint health
is preserved for this population. In order to address the major challenges of preventing shoulder disease and
dysfunction progression for manual wheelchair users, we need to assess the impact of and need for various
interventions relative to rotator cuff soft tissue health. In addition to inverse dynamic calculations of joint torques
or electromyographic measures, measuring the impact of interventions on rotator cuff soft tissue compression is
an important advancement in mechanistic understanding and outcomes assessment. Our proposal will combine
existing data sets from the University of Minnesota (20 precise 3D shoulder reconstructions including soft tissue)
and Mayo Clinic (10 participants’ precise 3D shoulder kinematics during wheelchair propulsion) to measure
rotator cuff compression for 200 unique combinations of shoulder geometry and kinematics. Aim 1 will
“Characterize the effect of anatomical features and movement patterns on rotator cuff tendon compression
during manual wheelchair propulsion”. Clinicians and transformational scientists need to know the relative
impacts of motion and anatomy/geometry on rotator cuff stresses during wheelchair propulsion.
Outcomes of this investigation will inform both mechanistic investigations and clinical trials assessing preventive
interventions. In addition, methods to directly assess soft tissue impact are labor- and technology-intensive. Our
proposed Aim 2 will “Determine the capability of low-fidelity models to predict in vivo tendon compression during
manual wheelchair propulsion” by directly comparing high- and low-fidelity techniques. Successful completion
of this project will determine the necessity or benefit of labor-intensive, subject-specific models over
lower fidelity alternatives in studying rotator cuff tendon injury mechanisms, and preventative outcomes.
This knowledge can then be applied extensively in future work by our group and others, including assessment
of transfers and other functional activities. Appropriate sample sizes for future work can also be planned with the
knowledge gained through this proposed project. This project provides a unique opportunity for collaboration
between experienced investigators and to combine existing data to determine relative utility of various
approaches for larger scale investigation planning. Our approach is responsive to the NICHD Notice of Special
Interest (NOT-HD-20-200) in that it leverages valuable existing data to advance understanding of shoulder soft
tissue disease and planning for future investigations by our multidisciplinary groups and others."

Two-thirds of persons with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) fall yearly, resulting in non-fatal and fatal injuries. Many
of these patients are recurrent fallers, due primarily to parkinsonian symptoms that interfere with postural control
and limit postural responses to both self-initiated and external perturbations. These symptoms cause excessive
co-contraction of agonists and antagonist muscle groups, hypometria, delayed stepping, and postural set
inflexibility (i.e., an inability to quickly change responses to different types, conditions, and intensities of postural
disturbances). Even with pharmacological and rehabilitation interventions, postural and balance deficits persist,
and the risk of falls remains intractable. Among older adults, balance perturbation training is emerging as an
effective method to reduce fall related injuries. In PwPD, however, one of the challenges to balance training is
that postural inflexibility may negatively impact motor skill acquisition, retention, and generalization. As a result,
motor learning strategies that are effective in individuals without PD may not be effective in PwPD. The overall
objective of this PhD dissertation proposal is to determine the effect of practice schedule on the acquisition,
retention, and generalization of protective balance responses in PwPD. The central hypothesis is that PwPD will
acquire and retain protective balance responses to treadmill perturbations through blocked, but not random,
initial practice schedules, and will require a follow-up set of random practice to generalize improvements to
overground perturbations. In specific aim 1, I will compare improvements in protective stepping stability after a
single session of blocked versus random practice of 10 slips and 10 trips in PwPD and age-matched healthy
controls. In specific aim 2, I will compare generalization of protective stepping stability to unpracticed overground
slip perturbations after blocked, followed by random practice sessions (blocked-random) to random, followed by
blocked (random-blocked) practice sessions of treadmill-induced perturbations (10 slips and 10 trips) in PwPD
and controls. Together, these findings will provide a basis for developing balance rehabilitation protocols based
on motor learning principles to mitigate falls in PwPD compared to age-matched controls."
10852953,"The goal of this project is to develop a Wireless, fully Implantable, bidirectional Cortical Neuroprosthetic System (W-ICONS) for restoring sensorimotor function through an interface with intact upper limb areas of primary motor and sensory cortex. Technologies that enable direct communication to and from the brain have increasingly shown promise for restoring independence to people affected by high spinal cord injuries. Despite these advances, neural interface systems are still mostly confined to laboratory settings, requiring a team of researchers to handle cumbersome transcutaneous interfaces, extensive wiring, and bulky devices for recording and stimulating neural activity. Further, these devices have typically been equipped exclusively with neural recording capabilities. The W-ICONS device would be the first wireless, bidirectional—incorporating neural recording and stimulation—cortical implant for tetraplegic individuals, creating a truly portable device for use outside the lab environment. This proposed translational study benefits from over a decade of clinical studies with microelectrode arrays, demonstrating safety and efficacy in restoring lost sensorimotor functions. The Brain Gate and Revolutionizing Prosthetics clinical trials have demonstrated that functionally relevant control over prosthetic arms and communication devices can be achieved and maintained for years. More recent studies from a number of groups (including our own) have shown that intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) can provide stable, localized sensory percepts capable of improving task performance on reach-and-grasp tasks. Critically, our team has led and received FDA and institutional regulatory approvals for four first-in-human demonstrations. Here, we will be extending our team’s state-of-the-art fully implantable wireless recording system with the addition of stimulation capabilities. Benchtop verification of the W-ICONS system (Aim 1), will be followed by preclinical testing of the device in an animal model, will support an FDA IDE submission (Aim 2) to conduct an early feasibility study (Aim 3) at JHU of the W-ICONS with individuals affected by high spinal cord injury (tetraplegia). The aim of the clinical study at JHU is to validate chronic safety and efficacy of the W-ICON system in two participants in a 1-year study (minimum). Safety will be demonstrated if the device is not explanted due to safety reasons during the study period. Demonstration of efficacy will require control of sensorized robotic arms in pick- and-place tasks (e.g., Action Research Arm Test) and reported perception of ICMS in the hand area. Successful demonstrations will support a study protocol amendment to go beyond one year of implantation and to transition use of the device to patients’ homes."
10758604,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is renewed international momentum to develop vaccines to prevent infections caused by the highly
adapted, human-restricted bacterial pathogen Group A Streptococcus (GAS). However, the lack of a known
correlate of human immune protection against GAS infection and the limitations of current in vitro assays and
preclinical models have impeded development of promising preclinical vaccine candidates and threatens future
investment in GAS vaccine discovery and design. To overcome this roadblock, we will undertake a cross-
disciplinary collaborative research program, drawing on highly relevant human samples and developing a new
human ex vivo tissue model, to discover broadly applicable potential human correlates of protection that will
inform design of practical immunoassays fit for deployment in clinical vaccine trials. Rather than adhering to the
constraints of historical GAS immunoassays, we are explicitly targeting preferred characteristics for clinical
immunogenicity assays to support vaccine development, such as practicality, accuracy and broad application to
relevant syndromes and strains.
GAS naturally infects humans only, therefore we will take a human-centred approach, purposefully moving away
from animal models that do not adequately represent relevant complexities of the human immune response. We
will apply cutting edge immunology approaches to study diverse human samples from parallel research
programs, including from externally funded trials using our own GAS human challenge model to evaluate vaccine
protection against pharyngitis, the primary target indication for vaccine development efforts. Initial published
findings from the GAS pharyngitis human challenge model show that protection may be associated with robust
early mucosal and systemic Th1 inflammatory responses, in clear alignment with recent preclinical animal model
findings, and highlighting vaccine-induced antigen-specific Th1 responses as a correlate of protection for
multicomponent vaccines. We will characterize the transcriptomic basis for this immune response using our
existing human sample collection. We will draw on our experience with human whole blood stimulation assays
and tissue models to establish whole-blood and organotypic tonsil tissue models as our primary research tools.
This approach will allow us to interrogate ex vivo human immune responses to whole bacteria, culture
supernatant, and vaccine antigens to discover potential systemic and mucosal correlates of protection. These
broad-ranging efforts to identify immune pathways implicated in vaccine-induced protection will inform the design
of a practical, scalable, and strain-agnostic whole-blood in-tube assay (analogous to cytokine release assays),
and a high-throughput functional oral fluid mucosal assay to test in forthcoming clinical trials of novel GAS
vaccines."
10791796,"SUMMARY
Enterocytes optimize their morphology for solute uptake from the intestinal lumen by building an apical
specialization: a dense array of actin bundle-supported microvilli, collectively referred to as the “brush border”.
By scaffolding apical membrane, brush border microvilli significantly increase the capacity for housing
membrane-bound transporters and channels that drive solute transport. In the cytoplasm immediately beneath
the apical surface, the rootlets of microvillar core actin bundles are anchored in a meshwork of filaments known
as the “terminal web” first visualized in classic ultrastructural studies decades ago. Rich in intermediate and actin
filaments, this network is dense enough to exclude microtubules, vesicles and other large organelles. Although
the terminal web is well-positioned to regulate a range of critical subcellular activities, the function and
composition of this domain and its contribution to intestinal physiology remain unclear. In exciting preliminary
studies, we identified non-muscle myosin-2C (MYO2C) as a component of the enterocyte terminal web. MYO2
molecules consist of an N-terminal motor domain that binds actin and generates force, and a C-terminal rod-like
tail, which drives the formation of contractile filaments in cells. Among the three non-muscle myosin-2 isoforms
(2A,2B,2C), MYO2C is unique in that its expression is largely specific to the intestinal epithelium. Additionally,
single cell RNAseq analysis indicates that MYO2C demonstrates clear enrichment in enterocytes relative to other
epithelial cell types in the gut. We found that MYO2C is highly enriched at the base of the brush border in villus
enterocytes from mouse and human small intestine, and in cultured intestinal epithelial cell lines. Super-
resolution microscopy revealed that MYO2C forms an extensive network of puncta in the plane of the terminal
web, which spatially overlaps with the rootlets of microvillar actin bundles. Small molecule and genetic
perturbation studies in cultured epithelial cells leads to dramatic elongation of microvilli, suggesting these
MYO2C may promote actin disassembly from rootlet pointed ends. Finally, we found that MYO2C KO mice have
defects not only in microvillar organization, but also in enterocyte- and villus-scale tissue structure. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that MYO2C forms a terminal web contractile network that controls brush border
actin architecture and propagates tissue-scale mechanical forces to enable efficient collective cell migration up
the crypt-villus axis. To test this hypothesis, we will employ a combination of state-of-the-art super-resolution
microscopy, advanced forms of electron microscopy, and lattice light sheet live imaging to: (Aim 1) map the
organization of the terminal web MYO2C network, (Aim 2) investigate the mechanism of MYO2C-dependent
microvillar length regulation, and (Aim 3) define the function of MYO2C in the terminal web in vivo. These studies
will lead to new paradigms for understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control the morphology of
enterocytes and the epithelial tissue they comprise."

The preteen years are a critical period in which to study the development of suicidal thoughts
and behavior (STB). During this period, youth experience changes in emotion regulation and
develop cognitive capacities that include an emerging understanding of the permanence of
death, which in turn affect the expression of STB. However, as noted in the 2021 NIMH-
Sponsored Research Round Table Series: Risk, Resilience, and Trajectories in Preteen
Suicide, research on preteen STB has been hindered by the field’s failure to focus on an
accurate, and thorough, assessment of STB in this age group.This application seeks to
develop and test a comprehensive approach to the assessment of preteen STB that includes
child and parent/guardian self-report, clinician interviews, an implicit association test, a death
understanding interview, and observational measures. In order to address this question, this
application will examine both concurrent and predictive validity of the assessment approach in
preteens receiving intensive psychiatric services (inpatient or partial hospitalization) who have
a range of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as well as a range of STB. We will recruit
360 preteens at Bradley Hospital/Brown Medical School and the Johns Hopkins School of
Medicine, ensuring a diverse sample of children. In addition to refining the assessment of
preteen STB, we will also: 1) conduct a thorough clinical assessment of related
symptomatology to better inform clinical practice, and 2) examine mechanisms hypothesized
to underlie preteen STB, using an RDoC-informed approach. We will also examine which co-
occurring symptoms and mechanisms significantly improve predictive validity for adverse
clinical STB outcomes above that of the STB assessment alone. This assessment approach is
innovative in that it is the first study to develop a multi-modal, multi-informant assessment
approach for preteen STB including use of real-time observational strategies, as well as an
implicit association test. This is significant because we are studying the most high-risk
population of preteens with STB and we will be able to delineate mechanisms related to
preteen STB. This work addresses: NIMH Strategic Objective 2.1.B “Characterize the
emergence and progression of mental illnesses”, 2.2.A “Determining early risk and protective
factors and related mechanisms”, and 2.2.B“Developing reliable and robust biomarkers and
assessment tools to predict illness onset, and course, across diverse populations”."

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful chronic disease affecting 27 million people in the US. Knee OA is
characterized by progressive damage and remodeling of all joint tissues. Major hallmarks of OA are joint pain
and joint space narrowing on x-ray (cartilage loss). Biomechanical factors play an important role in both joint
pain and damage, but exactly how mechanical forces act on sensory neurons and cartilage to drive the
disease is unknown. Our long-term goal is to elucidate how mechanical loading is sensed by joint tissues and
how responses to loading contribute to OA. Cells sense mechanical forces through a variety of mechanisms,
including mechanosensitive ion channels. Recently, the sensory neuron mechanosensitive ion channel
PIEZO2 was identified as a key contributor to mechanical allodynia in murine models of inflammatory and
neuropathic pain, but the role of PIEZO2 expressed by nociceptors and in persistent pain is not clear.
Furthermore, the function of mechanosensitive ion channels in chondrocytes is less clear, but based on
previous work implicating a role for PIEZO1 in chondrocyte responses to mechanical stimuli, we hypothesize
that PIEZO1 contributes to tissue damage in OA. Overall it is unknown how PIEZO ion channel signaling
contributes to OA pathology (pain and joint damage). We aim to address this question by using novel
techniques we have developed that enable application of mechanical stimuli to intact tissues while performing
calcium or voltage imaging to assess cell function in real time. This proposal addresses the Central Hypothesis
that: PIEZO channel signaling in nociceptors and chondrocytes drives pain and joint damage in the initiation
and progression of OA. The central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) To define the role of
PIEZO2 ion channel expressed by nociceptors in mediating peripheral sensitization and persistent pain
behaviors at different stages of the DMM model of OA; and 2) To investigate whether chondrocyte PIEZO1 ion
channel signaling promotes joint damage and pain in the DMM model. To perform these aims, we have
generated innovative techniques that enable application of mechanical stimuli to intact tissues while performing
real-time calcium or voltage imaging. We have created mice that express fluorescent calcium (GCaMP6s) or
voltage (ASAP2s) indicator proteins in either pain-sensing sensory neurons (nociceptors; NaV1.8 cre) or in
chondrocytes (Col2a1 cre). We also have two types of nociceptor-specific Piezo2 conditional knock-out mice
as well as chondrocyte-specific Piezo1 conditional knock-out mice. Successful completion of these aims will
improve our understanding of how nociceptors and chondrocytes use PIEZO channels to respond to
mechanical loading in OA, which may lead to the identification of novel pathways to target both pain and joint
damage therapeutically. By measuring both pain-related behaviors and joint damage in nociceptor-Piezo2
knock-out and chondrocyte-Piezo1 knock-out mice, this approach will provide insight on interactions between
these processes, which will set up future work."
10908548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescent cells (SnCs) play a causal role in aging and numerous age-related diseases. However, they also
contribute to beneficial biology such as wound healing and tissue remodeling. Both physiological and
pathological roles are linked to the secretome of SnCs and their complex interaction with the immune system,
which is thought to play an important role in clearing SnCs. Much of what has been learned about SnCs is derived
from studies in mice, where it has been clearly demonstrated that genetic or pharmacologic removal of SnCs in
aged or diseased organisms reduces frailty; improves strength, endurance, and resilience; and attenuates a
variety of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s. Discovering pharmacologic approaches to remove
disease-causing SnCs in humans could have a tremendous impact on our aging population. However, much
needs to be learned about SnCs to deploy such approaches safely and effectively in humans. This project aims
to establish a Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) across multiple institutions with demonstrated expertise in SnCs
and cell mapping to achieve a common goal; construction of a 4D atlas of SnCs in mouse tissues. The Midwest
Murine-TMC (MM-TMC) proposes to focus on 5 key tissues: mouse liver, adipose, lung, muscle, and brain. This
selection is based on MM-TMC’s expertise in the biology, cell biology, and immunology of these organs; lengthy
experience studying SnCs in these organs; and applying single cell and spatial technologies to study these
organs. The MM-TMC and its Administrative Core will be led by PIs with complementary expertise in organ
biology and senescence. The Biological Analysis Core will be led by three MPIs who have a long history of
collaboration around studying SnCs in aged mice and working with unique and innovative transgenic animals
that enable the production or ablation of lineage-specific SnCs. The Data Analysis Core will be led by two
bioinformaticians with expertise in single cell analysis, cell mapping, and multiplexing complex and disparate
data sets to deeply phenotype cells. Other key personnel add expertise in pathology, imaging, spatial mapping
of SnCs, tissue clearing, transgenic mice, and development of senolytics and immunotherapies to target SnCs.
A unique feature of the proposed MM-TMC is that the data collection will be done within existing cores largely at
the University of Minnesota by staff with expertise in state-of-the art spatial mapping platforms. This provides
stability in the analytical pipeline and in-place quality control and assurance mechanisms. Through systematic
and methodical study of SnCs in mouse tissues, the MM-TMC will make significant contributions informing and
validating the SenNet human atlas and will work closely with NIH, other TMCs, Technology Development
awardees, and the Consortium Organization and Data Coordinating Center to develop and adhere to standards
created by SenNet to accelerate the production of rigorous SnC tissue maps in both species."
10767306,"The Mid-America CTSA Consortium (MACC) submits this renewal application to continue as a Regional Clinical Center (RCC) for the “Strategies to Innovate EmeRgENcy Care Clinical Trials” (SIREN) Network (RFA-NS-22-015). Because Dr. Aufderheide (previous Contact PI at the Medical College of Wisconsin [MCW] Hub) has announced his retirement on January 1, 2024, and because his replacement is unknown at the time of grant submission, we propose to transfer the MACC Hub from MCW to the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) and Contact PI status to David Beiser, MD, MS (UCM) proactively. As recommended by the NIH Project Officer, we are submitting this application as a Renewal, rather than a New application, providing justification for this transfer. The structure of MACC otherwise remains unchanged. Methods: MACC has a proven track record of exemplary patient accrual performance. Despite not having a site within its catchment capable of participating in the HOBIT Trial, MACC is currently tied for 5th highest enroller among 11 Hubs, enrolling 116 subjects (10.0% of total) including 35 subjects (3rd highest) in BOOST-3, 38 subjects (5th highest) in ICECAP, and 43 subjects (6th highest) in C3PO. Patient retention was 98.3% (114/116; 4th highest). This renewal application adds a strategic focus on even greater patient accrual by: 1) investing $10,000/year infrastructure funding in research coordinator support at all 6 MACC sites, 2) a Patient Accrual Liaison (PAL) to proactively identify accrual barriers, 3) rapidly resolving barriers by leveraging CTSA Collaborative Council support, 4) incorporating a Clinical Trial Practicum (entering SIREN patients) into the Clinical Trials Fellowship (CTF) to augment patient accrual, 5) adding 7 new ED expansion sites and 196,455 potential patients/year, and 6) securing an additional $1.71 Million of institutional funds for SIREN. The UCM research team, experienced in supervising Spokes, and the Center for Health and the Social Sciences, experienced in subcontract management, are strong assets. The CTF provides targeted curriculum, over 20% protected time, a Clinical Trial Practicum, K Award submission post completion, and an additional $50,000 institutional funding to train 3, 2- year fellows. All MACC sites agree to continue Reliance and Master Contract Agreements. With a Hub, 5 Spokes, 3 EMS, 4 helicopter systems, catchment of 9,931,200 people, 110,598 potential patients/year, 190 multi- disciplinary collaborators, expansion capacity of 23 adult, 5 pediatric hospitals, and 2 EMS systems, 46 research personnel, 24/7 coverage at all sites, a strategic patient accrual plan, and proven performance, MACC is well- positioned to achieve SIREN goals. Specific Aims. MACC aims to: 1) Meet/exceed recruitment goals of at least 100 subjects per year, including diverse/underserved populations, 2) Achieve all study milestones and exemplary clinical trial execution, 3) Engage a wide spectrum of investigators, 4) Mentor 3 junior faculty investigators to successful academic careers in emergency clinical trial research, 5) Contribute significantly to SIREN governance, and 6) Promote dissemination of SIREN study findings and stimulate SIREN grant applications."
10766686,"The overall goal of the Strategies to Innovate Emergency Care Clinical Trials Network (SIREN) is to improve the outcome of patients suffering acute illness and injury by identifying effective treatments given in the earliest stages of care. Emergency conditions such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, traumatic injury including brain and spinal cord injury, and seizures cause significant morbidity and mortality and exact a high cost in terms of human suffering and health care spending. Pre-clinical and translational research has demonstrated that there is a very narrow window of opportunity in which many novel treatments for emergency conditions are optimally effective, and that conducting research in the emergency setting presents unique pragmatic challenges to clinical investigators. Effective clinical trials in these conditions require a coordinated network of emergency physicians, surgeons, cardiologists, intensivists, neurologists and biostatisticians. This renewal application, in response to RFA-NS-22-014 describes the features, functions and coordination we will continue to provide as the Clinical Coordinating Center for the SIREN network. The key elements of this ongoing structure include an interdisciplinary team of investigators with specific expertise in the conduct of clinical trials of emergency interventions, a hub-and-spoke network design that acknowledges the importance of enrolling patients in the acute setting, and a long term network commitment to advancing the national research infrastructure as it relates to the interdisciplinary study of acute illness and injury. This project continues to create and maintain a coherent, collaborative, multidisciplinary emergency clinical trials community that is diverse and inclusive. The network will recruit, efficiently perform, and widely disseminate the most scientifically and clinically important trials necessary to advance the emergency care of patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, hematologic and trauma emergencies. SIREN initiated 5 large, simple multicenter trials over the previous 5 year grant period, and will initiate at least 4 more in the next grant period. The network aims to transform the emergency research enterprise, by exploring innovations in clinical trial designs, by better and earlier engagement of patient stakeholders in trial planning, and by creative improvements in implementing and performing trials."

Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment, demand for services and new technologies will increase. The PhASR
will expand its staff, instrumentation and services before capacity is reached. Recent and new technologies on
order will enhance our efforts for accurate and sensitive measurements in samples of small quantity, focus on
development of assays to accurately quantify immunotherapies and other biologics and increase statistical
modeling services for PK/PD relationships at the cellular, tumor, organ, or whole body levels. The annual budget
of the PhASR is $612,272 yet the CCSG request is $94,171. As such, the PhASR leverages extensive
institutional support and seeks only 15.4% support from CCSG funds."
10770539,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROTEOMICS SHARED RESOURCE (PSR)
The PSR provides expertise and access to state-of-the-art instrumentation for proteomics experiments. The PSR
is embedded within the OSU Campus Chemical Instrument Center, offering competitive pricing and exceptional
service by leveraging generous support from the Office of Research and Colleges, and grants from the NIH.
During the last review, the PSR was rated Outstanding as part of the Analytics Shared Resource Group, with
three addressable comments to reduce turn-around time, a perceived drop in percent users actually due to an
increase of non-cancer users as an OSU facility, and perceived duplicative services. Major services include: 1)
consultation for sample preparation, MS experiment design, data analysis, and timelines; 2) protein identification
using state-of-the-art MS on a variety of sample matrices; 3) in depth protein characterization including, but not
limited to, post-translational modifications, protein variant/mutations, protein truncation sites detection, alternate
splice form detection, de novo protein sequencing, protein cross-linking, and protein-protein interactions; 4)
protein quantification using label-free (spectral counts and/or relative intensity) or stable isotope label techniques
(SILAC or ITRAQ/TMT), quantitative MALDI tissue imaging, and targeted mass spectrometry; and 5) data
analysis provided with the BISR using commercial and in-house developed software platforms. Major equipment
has been enhanced in the past 5 years through three NIH S10 grants and a funded P41 Resource Center for

services; 2) provide innovative proteomic data analytics and bioinformatics platforms to facilitate user
interpretation; and, 3) provide consultation on experimental design and training on self-operated MS instruments.
Over the current funding cycle, the PSR provided key services in support of 44 publications (5 > 10 impact
factor), 380 users, and 8 NCI grants, including 1 K22, 1 P01, 4 R01s, 1 R33 and 1 U01. The PSR is critical to
the OSUCCC research priorities of immuno-oncology, translational genomics, cancer engineering and cancer
prevention and survivorship. Advanced analytical platforms allow researchers to discover novel differentially
expressed proteins in serum, urine, BAL fluid, saliva, frozen tissues, formalin fixed tissues, cell culture media,
and cell lysates. Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment, demand for services and new technologies will
increase. The GSR will expand its staff, instrumentation and services before capacity is reached. To address
this, planned new services are being implemented or expanded (informatics services with BISR, capillary
electrophoresis and ion mobility methods, tissue imaging, and structural biology using native MS, as developed
by a P41 Resource grant). Over the next funding period, the PSR will be a member of the Immune Monitoring
and Discovery Platform. The annual budget of the PSR is $1,993,101, yet the CCSG request is $158,381. Thus,
the PSR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 7.9% support from CCSG funds."
10770543,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RECRUITMENT, INTERVENTION AND SURVEY SHARED RESOURCE (RISSR)
The RISSR was established in 2003, as the Behavioral Measurement Shared Resource (BMSR), to provide a
mechanism for supporting behavioral, epidemiological and clinical research within the broader research goals of
the OSUCCC. Renamed in 2019, the RISSR provides essential services to support non-interventional studies
(observational, epidemiologic) as well as non-therapeutic intervention studies. Thus, the RISSR is a niche
service for population scientists in CC and MCC providing efficient and high quality services for investigators to
conduct population science research. RISSR also works with the BSSR to support the Total Cancer Care (TCC)
project accruals, and translational research involving human data collection and interventions for all 5 research
programs. For the next funding period, the RISSR specific aims are to: 1) provide expertise in research design,
the selection and/or development of surveys and study measures, including patient-reported outcomes; 2) assist
investigators with participant recruitment, accrual goals, and retention to ensure the inclusion of research
participants that are representative of the target population(s); and 3) provide investigators with expertise and
services in the collection and management of quantitative and qualitative research data, and population-based
data retrieval for grant applications and registry studies. Collected data are managed for seamless transfer to
the BSR for data analysis. Over the current funding cycle, the major changes to the RISSR were greater adoption
of electronic data collection for the majority of OSUCCC studies, using text messaging with participants for more
flexible communication, data collection and study conduct; increased use of mobile health interventions; and
providing support for more program projects and large multi-heath center/ multi-state research projects. During
the current funding cycle, RISSR has supported 35 principal investigators (54% OSUCCC members) and
contributed to 71 publications (1 >10 impact factor) and 9 NCI grants including 1 K01, 1 K07, 1 K12, 1
P01, 2 P50s, 2 R01s, and 1 R37. The RISSR will directly support the OSUCCC priority for immune-oncology
and cancer prevention and control. The RISSR will expand its staff, instrumentation and services before capacity
is reached. In the next funding cycle, the RISSR will: 1) further develop and customize survey and data collection
methods; 2) expand and support participant recruitment registries for rapid accrual for interventional and
epidemiological studies; 3) expand the provision of smart phones to study participants to reduce disparities in
participant recruitment and participation; and 4) develop greater linkages with the BISR to share computer
platforms and expertise related to clinical informatics, eHealth interventions using the electronic health record,
and health services research. The RISSR will also work with the BSR and BISR as part of the Biomedical
Informatics Coordinating Center (BMICC) Working Group to establish national data coordinating centers at the
OSUCCC on cancer-related topics. The annual budget of the RISSR is $1,631,722, yet the CCSG request is
$92,102 (5.6%) reflecting strong institutional support and a robust chargeback system."
10770545,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SMALL ANIMAL IMAGING SHARED RESOURCE (SAISR)
The SAISR provides critical support to OSUCCC’s preclinical imaging needs and translational therapeutic
development to provide a fundamental service for monitoring live animal tumor progression and regression,
metastatic spread, and response to therapeutic interventions. Services include pre-study consultation, small
animal imaging, analysis and data interpretation, and education and training. Major equipment in SAISR includes
a Bruker 9.4T MRI, a Vevo high frequency ultrasound, an IVIS Lumina II, a Bruker Skyscan 1276 microCT, an
Xstrahl Small Animal Radiation Research Platform, and an Echo-MRI. SAISR’s Specific Aims are to: 1) provide
OSUCCC investigators’ access to high resolution non-invasive small animal imaging technologies that can be
used to evaluate small animal cancer models and treatment therapies in vivo; 2) provide accurate qualitative
image interpretation and quantitative image data analysis to al OSUCCC users; 3) identify, evaluate, and
implement new and emerging technologies that address specific needs of the OSUCCC investigators; and 4)
recognize and promote integration of other shared resource services that add value to investigators studies,
such as the CPDISR that provides necropsy and pathology services for mice, and the MSR that provides high
resolution microscopy imaging of ex vivo tissue samples. The SAISR is located within the Biomedical Research
Tower, centrally located to most OSUCCC researchers. The Director of the SAISR is Dr. Kimberly Powell, who
has managed the facility since 2011. The Senior Faculty Advisor is Dr. Nicholas Denko (CB), who provides
overall scientific vision for the SAISR. During current grant cycle, the SAISR identified important new imaging
modalities (echoMRI, the Xtrahl SAARP, and the SkyScan 1276 microCT) and worked with investigators and the
OSUCCC to obtain them. During this time period, the SAISR has contributed to 41 publications (9 > 10 impact
factor), 156 users, and 41 NCI including 27 R01s, 3 R21s, 4 U01s, 5 P01s, 1 P50 and 1 R03, involving members
from all five programs. Given the robust OSUCCC recruitment of the OSUCCC and its research priorities,
demand for services and new technologies will increase. The SAISR will expand its staff, instrumentation and
services before capacity is reached. Additionally, the SAISR will add PET scanning and optoacoustic imaging.
SAISR is working to: 1) develop optimized protocols for quantifying lung metastases and pancreatic tumor
burden using the newly acquired microCT; 2) collaborate with the CPDISR, MSR, and TVdSR and the Genetically
Engineered Mouse Models Core (a non-CCSG activity) to comprehensively characterize disease progression in
mouse cancer models (i.e., lung, pancreatic, glioblastoma, and breast); and 3) expand molecular imaging
capabilities. If images are digitized, they could be used for machine learning techniques. The SAISR will be a
regular member of the Immune Monitoring and Discovery Platform. The annual budget is $575,505, yet the
CCSG request is $61,080. Thus, the SAISR leverages extensive institutional support and seeks only 10.6%
support from CCSG funds."
10881622,"SUMMARY
The success of the High Plains Intermountain Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (HICAHS) is grounded
in engaging and listening to stakeholders and responding to regional needs with sound and relevant programs
and partnerships. Building on a substantial record of accomplishments in research, intervention, education and
outreach, we propose an innovative transdisciplinary Center that leverages expertise and resources among
partners to promote a healthy agricultural and forestry/logging population in PHS Region VIII (Colorado,
Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and beyond. Over the past 6 years we have fostered
a One Health approach with the rapidly expanding dairy industry in our region, responded to the disproportionate
COVID-19 impacts on agricultural workers, and strengthened partnerships in occupational safety with the logging
industry in Montana.
This proposal brings together an internationally recognized leadership team, outstanding new investigators, and
a well-developed regional partnership to address the new and unique needs of this region. Building on the
Regional Needs Assessment and following diversity, equity, and inclusion principles, we will continue to advance
health and safety in the region. The Mission of HICAHS is to improve the health and well-being of workers in
food, fiber, and timber production by engaging partners in transdisciplinary research, education, and prevention
programs across the region. The Center’s long-term goal is to reduce the risk of work-related injuries, fatalities,
and illnesses primarily in the agriculture and forestry subsectors in the region. We propose integrating new and
existing knowledge and using multiple routes of dissemination to translate research into improved agricultural
health and safety practices through our three Cores: 1. Evaluation & Planning Core; 2. Research Core including
our Pilot/Feasibility Program, two Basic/Etiological Research projects, one Intervention Research project, and
one Translation Research project; 3. Outreach Core including our Community-Initiated Grant Program. By
achieving our aims, we expect an effective Center infrastructure, cohesive and complementary research and
outreach efforts, and strengthened partnerships among researchers and practitioners working together to
support the agricultural and forestry workforce. Ultimately, we expect our work to contribute to the reduction of
risks of work-related injuries, fatalities, and illnesses and usher in our vision of a healthy and safe agriculture and
forestry workforce in the HICAHS region and beyond."
10812988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this Phase II SBIR, HomesRenewed Ventures, LLC (HRV Washington, DC) will build on our previous efforts
to expand and validate an interactive mobile application (APP) for guiding home modifications (environmental
interventions) critical to Aging in Place (AiP). Home modifications (HM) are associated with falls preventions,
improved activities of daily living (ADLs), and emotional wellbeing. However, over 95% of existing homes in the
US are not appropriate for AiP, and a preventive or proactive procurement of HMs remains an unmet need. In
addition, approximately 72 million Americans will be aged 65 or older by 2030. Thus, there is an urgent need to
update 100 million existing homes. However, currently, no tools provide access to standardized instructions,
training, product specifications, and hardware selections to ensure accurate and efficient installations. HRV aims
to address this unmet need by developing an innovative and reproducible solution for efficient, cost-effective,
and quality HMs to support a preventive or proactive procurement of HMs, enabling older adults to AiP longer.
In Phase I, HRV developed a prototype APP that uses site-specific inputs from a contractor or handyperson to
generate customized guidance and instructions for proper specification, placement, and installation of bathroom
grab bars. The APP simultaneously allows photo documentation of the installation process to verify compliance
with instructions. Informed by the Phase I outcomes, including proven feasibility of the APP concept to
systematize HM as well as the specific feedback provided by end-users, we aim to refine and expand our APP’s
features and functionalities and rigorously validate its effectiveness as a practical job site tool. To accomplish
these goals, we will pursue four specific aims: Aim 1 will provide the design criteria for a broader range of HMs
critical to independent mobility (climbing stairs, moving in and out of the home) and personal hygiene (toileting
and bathing) to be programmed in the APP. Aim 2 will enhance the APP usability and user experience by
expanding features and functionalities critical to the user’s efficiency and productivity. A new prototype will be
ready for extensive testing and validation at the end of this Aim. In Aim 3, we will develop three physical mock-
ups to simulate real-life scenarios in which contractors work to complete the proposed installation. Finally, aim 4
will be a validation study assessing the APP’s ability in guiding installers to correctly install HMs irrespective of
the installer’s experience. The outcome of this Aim will demonstrate APP reproducibility in enabling consistent
HM solutions in real life. The product of Phase II will be an enhanced and rigorously tested, and validated
commercialization-ready prototype. The data generated during Phase II will be critical to boosting customer/end-
user confidence. Our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life for millions of aging adults residing in their
homes through our innovative solution."
10758240,"Project Summary:
 Neurological disorders pose an immense burden on patients, families, and health care systems, thus un-
derscoring the urgent need to develop disease-modifying treatment. Research on Alzheimer's disease and other
degenerative diseases faces unique challenges, including the fact that these disorders typically have slow pro-
gression, the diagnostic criteria rely on clinical symptoms due to a lack of highly sensitive and speciﬁc biomarkers
in many diseases, and there is substantial disease and subject heterogeneity. Precision medicine initiative has re-
cently been launched in diverse populations, providing access to data on hundreds of thousands of individuals and
millions of families history records. International consortia of neurological disorders (e.g., National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center, Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative) were established to unify multi-modality data in
several large existing cohorts and provide access to new biomarker data. Digital phenotypes as real-world as-
sessments of patients are being tested as digital biomarkers to track disease progression and potentially serve as
digital endpoints for clinical trials. The main goal of this proposal is to develop modern analytic methods for these
new data types and studies in order to address the emerging challenges in research on personalized disease
susceptibility, progression, diagnostics, and treatments. We will build data-generative models that will lever-
age complementary contributions from multi-type biomarkers, including genomic measures, brain neuroimaging,
bioﬂuids, comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessments, and digital biomarkers. These methods will be applied
to carefully selected clinical data collected by the investigative team or available from large consortia in order to
guide genetic counseling and risk prediction, assist disease staging and clinical trial design, and optimize person-
alized treatment policies. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1 we will jointly analyze co-morbidities from family data to estimate
co-heritability and dissect whether shared phenotypic co-variation is due to latent environmental factors, genetic
factors, or both. In Aim 2, we will develop an integrated, multi-domain dynamic system for mixed-type biomarkers
(e.g., neuroimaging, genomics, ﬂuid, clinical, neuropsychiatric markers) using differential equations modeled on
a novel progression scale that uses latent processes. In Aim 3, we will leverage gold-standard neuropathological
diagnosis based on postmortem brain autopsy combined with antemortem biomarkers to improve clinical diagno-
sis of neurological disorders. In Aim 4, we will model multi-domain digital phenotypes to learn optimal treatment
policy from digital biomarkers. In each aim, we will establish theoretical properties using modern empirical pro-
cess theory and statistical learning theory. Together, the state-of-the-art analytic methods proposed here will
substantially improve analytic accuracy, and our combined statistical and clinical expertise will ensure that our
methods are translated directly back to the clinical and translational research community."
10791892,"Naturally-occurring cell death is essential to pattern formation in the developing nervous system. Retinal astro-
cytes undergo an unusual non-apoptotic form of death mediated by microglia; this mechanism is crucial for pat-
terning astrocytes into a template that controls angiogenesis. Despite this importance, the mechanism by
which microglia kill astrocytes is unknown. To unravel these mechanisms one must know the cellular and mo-
lecular characteristics of the microglia that kill astrocytes, but this too remains unknown. The objective here is
to identify microglia that execute developmental astrocyte death and the mechanisms that enable this function.
The central hypothesis is that a developmentally transient microglial population, termed nerve fiber layer-
associated microglia (NFL-M), responds to astrocyte-derived “eat-me” signals and mediates astrocyte elimina-
tion. The rationale for this work is that knowledge of astrocyte death mechanisms will make it possible to learn
how the astrocyte and vascular networks arrive at their mature pattern – in both normal and pathological de-
velopment. Further, as non-apoptotic “death by phagocyte” can occur also in neurodegenerative disease, in-
sight into death mechanisms may have broad relevance for disease pathobiology. The Specific Aims are: 1)
Identify retinal microglial subsets that are recruited by astrocyte “eat-me” signals. Preliminary studies
show that phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is an astrocyte cell-surface “eat-me” cue that recruits phagocytic micro-
glia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing identified a microglial population, the NFL-M, that is likely to be the astrocyte-
responsive subset. This working hypothesis will be tested by manipulating astrocyte density and PtdSer expo-
sure, which should alter the number and/or retinal distribution of NFL-M if the hypothesis is correct. 2) Identify
microglial populations that execute astrocyte engulfment. Prolonged bouts of phagocytosis require high
mitochondrial output. NFL-M show transcriptional signatures of intense mitochondrial metabolism including ac-
tivation of Nrf2 signaling, a key response to metabolic stress. These data suggest NFL-M are highly phagocytic
towards astrocytes; this hypothesis will be tested in vivo using genetic manipulations that prevent microglia
from assuming the NFL-M state or activating Nrf2. 3) Identify genes expressed by astrocyte-associated
microglia that mediate their function. If astrocytes are killed by a transcriptionally unique microglial popula-
tion, the genes that make them unique should support this function. Lgals3, a gene with known roles in phago-
cytosis, is selectively expressed by NFL-M. Preliminary data show that it is crucial for microglial phagocytosis
in retinal degeneration, supporting the working hypothesis that it will also be required for astrocyte removal.
This will be tested using Lgals3 conditional mutant mice. Completion of this work is expected to define specific
microglial subsets that kill developing astrocytes and their contribution to retinal astrocyte and vascular pattern-
ing. This will be significant because it will open the way to defining mechanisms underlying death by phagocyte
and the contributions of this novel death mechanism to nervous system development and disease."
10827390,"Project Summary
Barrett’s esophagus (BE), the condition in which an abnormal columnar mucosa replaces esophageal
squamous mucosa damaged by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is the only known precursor of
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a deadly cancer whose incidence has increased more than eight-fold over
the past 50 years. During this time, our primary strategy for preventing EAC deaths has remained essentially
unchanged - using endoscopy to screen GERD patients for BE, and enrolling BE patients in a program of
endoscopic surveillance. This stagnant strategy has failed to stem the rising frequency of EAC because current
screening practices are inadequate, and because surveillance relies on finding dysplasia, a biomarker with
considerable shortcomings, to trigger a cancer-preventive intervention. New screening tests are available that
could profoundly increase identification of BE patients, but it makes little sense to expand screening efforts
merely to enter more patients into expensive, ineffective surveillance programs. The TissueCypher BE Assay,
which can detect precancerous molecular and cellular changes in BE biopsies without dysplasia, has the
potential to be a precision risk-stratification test that could change the practice paradigm for BE patients.
Retrospective, case-control studies, heavily enriched with patients who developed dysplasia and EAC, have
shown that TissueCypher can identify BE patients at high and low risk for neoplastic progression. However, if
TissueCypher is to be used clinically for risk stratification, then the promising results of these studies in a
“cherry-picked” population of BE patients will need validation in a general population of patients with non-
dysplastic BE (NDBE). Ideally, validation would be in the form of a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), but the
large sample size and lengthy follow-up durations required for such a study on NDBE have been deemed
untenable. Our proposed study utilizes an alternative, innovative design to assess TissueCypher’s predictive
performance accurately without the untenable requirements of an RCT. We will use biopsy specimens already
available in a large community GI practice to establish an unbiased study cohort of 2,000 consecutive patients
who had baseline endoscopies with biopsies showing NDBE in 2008-2011, and who had ≥1 follow-up
endoscopies performed up to December 2021. TissueCypher will be run on baseline biopsy specimens, and
we will assess its performance in predicting neoplastic progression as identified in subsequent endoscopic
biopsies. We also will determine if TissueCypher’s predictive performance can be improved by incorporating
clinical variables and enhanced image analysis features. Validation of TissueCypher’s ability to risk-stratify BE
patients could shift the BE clinical practice paradigm from one of expensive and ineffective endoscopic
surveillance to one of precision medicine test-guided management with early intervention for high-risk patients
and reduced surveillance for low-risk patients. This would justify expanding BE screening efforts, and could
stem the rising frequency of EAC in a cost-effective manner."
10852814,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Oral emergency contraception (EC), is commonly used after recent unprotected intercourse to avoid undesired
pregnancy, but does not provide ongoing contraception. Rigorous data allow for use of intrauterine devices
(IUDs) as both EC and ongoing contraception, but EC efficacy data on use of the etonogestrel (ENG) implant,
is lacking. The CDC Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use support initiation of the ENG
implant if oral levonorgestrel (LNG) is given concomitantly for EC. This recommendation lacks supporting
evidence and serves as a barrier to method initiation, as oral LNG is not typically available in clinics when
clients desire an implant. Additionally, oral LNG efficacy decreases in higher body mass index (BMI) users and
the role of BMI on efficacy with co-administered oral LNG and the ENG implant is unknown. As the ENG
implant is also a synthetic progestogen with a rapid rise and consistent systemic levels, it could plausibly serve
as stand-alone EC or increase the efficacy of oral LNG with co-administration. Moreover, the EC mechanism of
action, which is related to ovulatory suppression with oral EC, may differ if the implant is initiated with or
without oral LNG, impacting efficacy in mid cycle users. This study addresses the following research gaps
around use of the ENG implant for EC that serve as barriers to provider comfort with these options: efficacy
with and without oral LNG, efficacy differences by BMI, and ovulation frequency with and without oral LNG.
We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority study to determine if the ENG implant alone is no
worse than the ENG implant + oral LNG for EC, using a 3.5% non-inferiority margin. We will include clients
who present to Planned Parenthood Association of Utah clinics with report of unprotected intercourse within 72
hours who desire EC. Eligible EC clients interested in an implant with a negative pregnancy test will be
allocated 1:1 to a study group: (1) ENG implant + oral LNG or (2) ENG implant + placebo. Our experienced
research staff will follow up with participants for 4-week efficacy data as primary outcome. Our aims include:
(1) To compare the efficacy of the ENG Implant + oral LNG to the ENG Implant + placebo for EC in 790
participants assessed by pregnancy status four weeks after implant placement, (2) To compare pregnancy risk
by BMI category (we anticipate half of the 790 participants will have a BMI ≥25) between and within the ENG
Implant + oral LNG and the ENG Implant + placebo groups, and (3) To evaluate ovulation frequency within 5
days of insertion of ENG Implant + oral LNG or ENG implant + placebo in 202 participants who are mid cycle
(day 7-14 post menses) at time of enrollment assessed by serum progesterone levels and urine fertility monitor
results. Our short-term goal is to expand evidence on the efficacy of implant initiation with or without oral LNG
to meet the needs of EC clients. Our long-term goals are to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines to
inform global contraceptive practices, allow for equity in LARC counseling at the time of EC, and support
reproductive autonomy for people to achieve to their life goals."
10752693,"Significant resources on age-related neurodegeneration are directed toward animal research in the
assumption that results will inform our understanding of parallel processes in human. Yet, no reliable method
exists to accurately translate cerebral blood flow or metabolic data from animal to human. For lack of rigorous
mathematical methods for cerebral metabolic parameters between species, translation of valuable research data
from mouse to human remains guesswork. There is a need for a predictive computational framework that
quantifies cerebral blood flow and metabolism in normal and diseased human brain states. Our long term goal
is to quantify fundamental physiological processes of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), so that their effects
can be slowed or even partially reversed. The objective is to expand the utility of MRI analysis by magnifying the
detectability of age-related microcirculatory changes in humans with a mechanistic mathematical framework. It
is our hypothesis that age and AD related changes in the microcirculation also generate macroscopic
perturbations of hemodynamic and/or oxygen perfusion states that will be detectable with advanced MRI
techniques, when guided by rigorous brain simulations over all relevant length scales. The rationale is that critical
physiological metrics for dysfunction in aged brains (=aging biomarkers) will be exposed by systematic
exploration and simulation of fundamental hemodynamic and metabolic processes. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
 Aim 1) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic modeling by simulating the link between capillary stalling,
vascular tracer transit properties, and tissue oxygen delivery, and validate predictions using advanced
microscopic imaging in mouse. We determine the effects of aging and AD in aged rodent brains.
 Aim 2) Develop mechanistic multiscale model for predicting the impact of cerebral perfusion on oxygen
metabolism in the human cortex under normal and pathological conditions. Anatomically detailed mechanistic
models of cerebral circulation in human will predict the effect of structural and functional changes in AD on
oxygen extraction in the human brain with MRI.
 Aim 3) Assess the predictive value of mechanistic multiscale modeling to quantify microvascular properties
across the human brain cortex in health and disease using advanced MRI. To validate the mechanistic translation
from mouse to human, we will measure age-related metabolic functions in cohorts of aged and Alzheimer
patients. We identify hemodynamic and metabolic metrics (=biomarkers) that correlate with cognitive decline
 This contribution is significant because it will predict how changes in vascular morphometry and metabolism
lead to neurological decline. It will identify biomarkers visible in noninvasive diagnostic imaging in humans that
signal age-related deterioration before symptoms develop. The mechanistic framework relating data acquired in
mouse to human will dramatically boost the relevance of animal data for human medicine."
10918039,"The research activities proposed in this application address a pressing need in American Indian (AI)
communities to better understand multi-level (i.e., community- , household- , and individual- level) factors in the
physical and socio-cultural environment that impact diet and cardiovascular diseases. The premise of the
proposed project was informed by: (1) our previous work in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) and the Strong Heart
Family Study (SHFS)—the largest multi-tribal cohort studies of risk factors for cardiovascular disease in AIs in
the USA—that highlighted the exceedingly high burden of obesity and poor diet quality among AIs; and (2)
findings from our Healthy Food, Healthy Families Feasibility Study—a small pilot study in a SHS/SHFS
community that assessed the major barriers and facilitators to eating healthy. Although the SHS/SHFS has
followed more than 4,000 AIs from 12 rural communities for the past 34 years, all data collected as part of the
study has focused on individual-level biological and behavioral factors associated with cardiovascular
diseases; no data has been collected on multi-level components of the physical or sociocultural food
environments in this cohort. As such, we have incomplete knowledge about the influence of these domains on
diet and cardiovascular health in these rural AI communities. To address these gaps, we will leverage existing
data from the SHS/SHFS, and add comprehensive assessments of multi-level factors related to the physical
and socio-cultural environment (factors selected based on previous pilot work) that may impact diet and
cardiovascular health to the upcoming SHS/SHFS exam in 12 rural AI communities.
 For this project, we will assess associations of community-level (e.g., food outlet availability, food cost,
norms around healthy eating), household-level (e.g., food insecurity, food outlet accessibility; food
preferences), and individual-level (e.g., perceived nutrition environment) aspects of the physical and socio-
cultural environment with diet (reported intake of fruits and vegetables; sugar-sweetened beverages) and
cardiovascular risk factors (BMI; fasting glucose) among SHS/SHFS participants from 12 tribes. We will also
assess the influence of participation in nutrition assistance programs (i.e., supplemental nutrition assistance
program (SNAP) or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations) on diet and cardiovascular risk
factors (i.e., reported intake of fruits and vegetables; sugar-sweetened beverages; BMI; fasting glucose).
Exploratory outcomes include: HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, incident diabetes and
incident cardiovascular diseases.
 Greater efforts are needed to understand the most salient factors that impact diet and cardiovascular
health in rural Tribal communities. This ancillary study will leverage existing resources from the SHS/SHFS,
while adding a comprehensive dietary assessment, measures of food security, and assessments of nutrition
economic and neighborhood environments to the study."

Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and Zika
virus, are a major cause of human disease. We are studying the early, post-fusion and pre-replication
events in the flavivirus lifecycle by using the prototype flavivirus, YFV, as our model. Our overarching
hypothesis is that flaviviruses, which alternately replicate in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, have
evolved to use i) highly conserved factors shared between hosts; and ii) multiple, redundant factors
that may not be well conserved between hosts. Therefore, discoveries made with YFV will be
validated and studied by comparison to other flaviviruses and between human and mosquito cells.
Aim 1 focuses on the post-fusion process of nucleocapsid uncoating, dissecting the mechanisms by
which cells unlock this fateful cargo. Aim 1 is a logical extension of our Preliminary Data showing that
the delivery of a translatable YFV genome requires cellular ubiquitylation and VCP/p97, a cellular
ATPase that extracts ubiquitylated proteins from large macromolecular complexes. Aim 2 focuses on
identifying the cellular protease(s) that cleave the viral NS1-2A polyprotein intermediate. Cleavage is
essential for flavivirus replication (shown here), yet the identity of this protease has remained elusive
for over two decades. We have identified a small family of related candidate NS1-2A proteases and
are validating their activity by rigorous, combinatorial genetic ablation. These efforts will solve long-
standing puzzles in flavivirus gene expression and replication and identify targets for future
development of broadly acting antivirals."

Our understanding of biology and human diseases is taking a significant leap forward due to access to whole
genome sequences and detailed protein structural information. The number of high-resolution protein structures
determined by single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is growing exponentially. The AlphaFold
neural network may soon provide high-resolution structures for the entire human proteome. Starting from a three-
dimensional protein structure, physics-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulation offers an atomic-level view of
protein’s motion. Fueled by the exponential growth of computing power, MD is becoming a powerful tool for
structure-function studies and assisting target-based drug discovery.
Despite the aforementioned progress, molecular mechanisms of pH-driven and proton-coupled dynamic pro-
cesses remain poorly understood. This is because proton positions are not resolved in most experimental struc-
tures and conventional MD does not describe proton-coupled dynamics or explicitly account for solution pH. One
such example is the human ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 protein (ABCG2), which contributes to
cancer drug resistance as well as renal excretion of urate.
While high-resolution structures for the entire proteome may soon become available, a large fraction of the pro-
teome is currently considered undruggable, i.e., intractable to traditional drug discovery efforts. The development
of chemical proteomics platforms for discovery of reactive and ligandable cysteines and lysines in human cell
lines holds the promise to significantly expand the druggable space. Nonetheless, the covalent ligandability of a
large fraction of the proteome remains unexplored, and a systematic knowledge is lacking.
In the previous R01 grant period, the Shen group has made significant progress in the development of GPU-
accelerated continuous constant pH MD (CpHMD) methods and application to elucidate proton-coupled structure-
dynamics-function relationships of various aspartyl proteases, cysteine proteases, kinases, as well as the mul-
tidrug efflux pump AcrB, sodium-proton antiporter NhaA, and µ-opioid receptor. The Shen group has also de-
veloped and applied a CpHMD method to predict reactive cysteine and lysine sites in a large number of kinases
and other proteins. Building on the progress and taking advantage of the vast data from structural genomics and
chemical proteomics, this R35 project seeks to fill the aforementioned gaps in tool development and knowledge.
We will tackle the remaining challenges in the development of the all-atom CpHMD method to enable routine
studies of proton-coupled dynamic processes. We will apply the all-atom CpHMD and other state-of-the-art MD
tools to illuminate the mechanism of the multidrug transporter and urate exporter ABCG2. Finally, we will evalu-
ate the entire proteome for covalent inhibition by integrating CpHMD, machine learning, and structure as well as
chemoproteomics data."
10899407,"Project Summary/Abstract
Precious metal catalysts are typically used for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) even
though first-row transition metals such as Ni are more sustainable and can facilitate unique reactivity. For exam-
ple, Ni-catalyzed reactions can readily form sp2-sp3 C–C bonds, which provides methods to synthesize the types
of non-planar APIs that are challenging to prepare using precious metal-catalyzed reactions. However, in general,
the relative lack of mechanistic understanding about Ni-catalyzed reactions has hindered their use in the syn-
thesis of APIs because it inhibits the development of improved systems and the rational design of new reactions.
One difficulty in elucidating the pathway of Ni-catalyzed transformations is that NiI complexes are often invoked
as intermediates but information about their reactivity is limited. In this project, novel NiI halide, alkyl, and aryl
species supported by bidentate nitrogen ligands, which are proposed as intermediates in reactions including
cross-coupling, cross-electrophile coupling (XEC), and metallaphotoredox based processes, will be synthesized.
The ability of these NiI complexes to undergo the proposed elementary steps in catalysis will be investigated as
a function of the ancillary ligand and reaction conditions using experimental and computational techniques.
These studies will be complemented by experiments to probe how NiI species are formed via comproportionation
between Ni0 and NiII complexes and in situ studies to elucidate the speciation of Ni catalysts during catalysis. It
is expected that our fundamental investigations will lead to the design of the next generation of Ni-catalyzed
reactions by providing guidelines about the reactivity of NiI complexes. Another problem with the development
of Ni-catalyzed reactions is that they often involve heterogeneous reductants, which complicate mechanistic
studies, create difficulties for scale up, and cannot readily be tuned to vary the reduction potential. The PI’s group
has developed a series of commercially available tunable homogeneous reductants, with reduction potentials
similar to Zn0. Apart from leading to improvements in practicality, the tunability of these reductants was crucial
for developing novel strategies for controlling the rate of alkyl radical generation from Katritzky salts and 1° alkyl
halides in Ni-catalyzed C(sp2)–C(sp3) XEC, which led to new reactivity. Here, tunable homogeneous reductants,
with reduction potentials similar to Mn0, a commonly used heterogeneous reductant, will be prepared. Kinetic
studies will be performed to understand the ability of the reductants to control the rates of alkyl radical formation
from N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters and 1°, 2°, and 3° alkyl halides. This will be accompanied by experi-
ments to identify ancillary ligands on NiII complexes that enable facile trapping of alkyl radicals, which is currently
unknown. The studies on alkyl radical generation and trapping will aid in solving significant problems in C(sp2)–
C(sp3) XEC, such as the use of aryl and alkyl chlorides and 3° alkyl halides as substrates. Finally, through a
collaboration with Merck, the new methods will be evaluated against medicinal chemistry targets and applied to
nanomole scale chemistry, which is an emerging strategy to prepare diverse libraries of bioactive compounds."

American Indian (AI) adolescent girls in the United States suffer from significant health disparities as compared
to their non-AI White peers. Increased sexual risk behaviors, earlier sexual debut, higher rates of teen
pregnancy, and higher rates of sexually transmitted infectious are more prevalent among AI adolescents as
compared to their non-AI peers. Poor health outcomes for adolescent AIs in the Great Plains are compounded
by high rates of poverty perpetuated by low high school graduation rates. Collectively, these risk factors place
AI adolescents at greater risk for negative health and educational outcomes. Previous studies have portrayed
the challenges of managing menstruation in low-resource settings and demonstrated poor health and well-
being outcomes associated with negative menstruation experiences. The goal of this proposed study is to gain
an understanding of the impact of menstruation on health and education for AI adolescent girls. The specific
aims are to (1) describe the in-school menstruation-related experiences of AI adolescent girls living in rural,
reservation communities and (2) describe the experiences, perceptions, and comfort level of middle and high
school teachers in tribal schools in responding to the menstrual experiences of their students. Aim 1 will use
community-informed focus group research to understand the following issues for AI adolescent females: (1)
learning and talking about menstruation; (2) menstruation education at school; (3) getting their first period; (4)
preparing for menstruation; (5) menstruation perceptions; (6) traditional menstruation customs; (7) learning
how to use menstrual products; (8) school-based menstruation experiences, including teacher behaviors and
perceived attitudes; and (9) menstruation benefits. The purpose of Aim 1a will be to compare/contrast early
and late adolescent menstruation experiences. Aim 2 will also use community-informed focus group research
to understand the following issues for educators at reservation-based middle or high schools: (1) frequency
with which they have assisted a student with a menstruation-related issue; (2) presence of menstrual products
within the classroom; (3) perceptions of menstruation experiences for girls at school; (4) comfort with
addressing menstruation-related issues with students; (5) actions taken when a girl experiences their period in
the classroom; (6) traditional menstruation customs; and (7) the impact of menstruation on student learning.
Aim 2a will focus on comparing and contrasting the experiences, perceptions, and comfort levels of teachers
by demographic, while Aim 2b will compare and contrast the experiences and perceptions of teachers with
those of the adolescents. The findings will be used to identify future intervention foci and methods to address
menstruation-related issues for this population. This study's focus is innovative and fills a crucial gap in efforts
to further understand and eliminate health disparities among AI adolescent girls and its findings will lay the
groundwork for designing and implementing culturally-appropriate interventions addressing menstruation-
related disparities for AI adolescent girls."
10735887,"The midgut of most arthropods is lined by a peritrophic matrix (PM) that is composed of a chitin backbone upon
which assemble a variety of glycosaminoglycans and proteins. The PM serves a defensive role within arthropods
by protecting their midgut epithelia from abrasive food particles, regulating the movement of ingested toxins, and
serving as a physical barrier against pathogen infection establishment. Some vector-borne protozoan pathogens,
including mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium and sand fly-transmitted Leishmania, secrete chitinases that can
degrade PM-associated chitin. However, tsetse fly-transmitted African trypanosomes do not produce chitinase,
and the mechanism(s) these parasites use to circumvent tsetse’s PM are poorly understood.
 In addition to potentially being infected with African trypanosomes, all tsetse flies harbor a taxonomically
variable community of endosymbiotic bacteria. The success of trypanosome transmission through the tsetse
vector depends in part on physiological interactions between the fly and these bacteria. One of tsetse’s
endosymbionts, Sodalis glossinidius, exhibits a homogeneous distribution within all laboratory colonized flies
and a heterogeneous distribution within and between wild fly populations. Several independent field and
laboratory-based studies have repeatedly demonstrated a positive correlation between the presence and density
of Sodalis in tsetse’s midgut and the ability of trypanosomes to successfully establish an infection in the fly. The
mechanisms that underlie this correlation have never been determined. In this application our interdisciplinary
research team will address the hypothesis that a Sodalis secreted endochitinase degrades the chitinous
backbone of tsetse’s PM. We speculate that Sodalis-mediated degradation of PM-associated chitin facilitates
trypanosome infection establishment in two ways. First, this process would compromise the structural integrity
of the PM, thus making it easier for trypanosomes to cross. Second, chitin catabolism results in the production
of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which is a potent inhibitor of trypanocidal lectins. We propose to use Sodalis mutants
that cannot produce endochitinase to functionally characterize the tripartite relationship between the bacterium,
tsetse’s PM, and trypanosome infection establishment in the fly’s midgut. Additionally, we propose to use field
captured tsetse flies to determine if their Sodalis produce endochitinase that mediates the structural integrity of
their tsetse host’s PM. Completion of the experiments proposed in this application will increase our
understanding of the basic physiological mechanisms that mediated trypanosome transmission through the
tsetse vector and may have translational implications towards the development of novel disease control
strategies. Additionally, knowledge obtained herein will be applicable to other arthropod vector model systems
(e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies) that house midgut-associated bacteria and have a PM that pathogens must
cross in order to be transmitted to a new vertebrate host."
10766228,"Project Summary
 Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) are important therapies. Though designed for parenteral nutrition, they
were discovered to be an antidote for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). With rising intravascular
concentrations of local anesthetics (LAs), which canonically inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav),
symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity progress to seizures, and cardiac arrest may ensue. LAST
is a major clinical challenge, and the identification of ILEs as treatment was a breakthrough that has made use
of LAs safer. Despite this important role, the molecular mechanisms by which ILEs treat LAST are not fully
understood. Furthermore, there is a paucity of studies examining whether Intralipid®, the emulsion
recommended in medical guidelines that is composed of long-chain triglycerides from soybean oil, is the best
choice. The most simplistic model for the effects of ILEs is that they form an intravascular compartment to
partition LAs and lower the effect-site concentration, but the degree to which concentrations fall in the aqueous
phase is debated. A competing hypothesis with strong evidence in cardiac models proposes ILEs serve as a fuel
via β-oxidation of triglycerides (TGs), overcoming mitochondrial dysfunction caused by LAs. This mechanism
has been dismissed to explain reversal of CNS dysfunction because of the dogmatic belief that neurons rely on
glucose metabolism. Additionally, neurotoxicity due to LAs has been attributed, with limited evidence, to
preferential block of inhibitory neurons, but important effects in the CNS are unexplained by this hypothesis. My
preliminary in vitro data shows that neurons can use Intralipid® to sustain synaptic function in the absence of
other fuels, supporting the metabolic hypothesis of ILEs for LAST in the CNS.
 This research proposal will test the hypothesis that ILEs reverse neurotoxicity by overcoming LA-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction. The experimental plan will systematically investigate the capacity for neurons to
metabolize components of ILEs. In doing so, I will comprehensively investigate the suitability of lipids to fuel
synaptic function. In Aim 1, I will use my developing expertise in optical imaging of cultured neurons expressing
genetically-encoded biosensors to compare lipids by their ability to sustain synaptic vesicle recycling and
produce ATP when deprived of glucose. Lipids will be tested as emulsions of both long- and medium-chain TGs
and free fatty acids of different lengths and saturation. In Aim 2, a metabolically optimized emulsion will be
compared in culture to Intralipid® in its ability to reverse LA-induced synaptic dysfunction. In Aim 3, the optimized
emulsion will be compared to Intralipid® in mice, quantifying effects on seizures with widefield calcium imaging,
local field potentials, and autofluorescence flavin imaging of metabolic activity. My five-year research and career
proposals capitalize on my excellent mentors and institutional environment. I will acquire the publication record
and expertise necessary for recognition as a national leader in anesthetic neuropharmacology and prepare for
independent investigation with R01 funding."
10814887,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with brain metastasis of lung cancer have extremely poor prognosis, high mortality rate, and frequent
incidence of tumor recurrence. Understanding the pathological mechanism of brain metastasis is urgently
needed to develop a novel and effective therapeutic strategy. Published data as well as the results of my own
study for brain metastasis of lung cancer indicate that smoking and nicotine significantly increased the
incidence and progression of brain metastasis, but the pathological mechanism by which the smoking
promotes brain metastasis through modulating brain microenvironment is yet poorly understood. Our
preliminary results showed that synaptic formation in brain metastasis region is strongly correlated with poor
overall survival of patients with brain metastasis. However, the exact role of neurons in brain metastasis
progression remains unclear. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of GABAnergic neuron
activation in the brain metastasis in order to develop innovative strategies for the treatment of brain metastasis.
I hypothesize that nicotine stimulates microglia to secrete exosomal miR-32-3p which promotes brain
metastasis by augmenting GABAergic synaptic formation and hence releasing GABA that serves as metabolic
substrate to fuel tumor cell growth. I also hypothesize that inhibiting the GABA transporter of tumor cell
suppresses brain metastasis by blocking GABA shunt. In Aim 1, I will clarify the molecular pathway through
which nicotine stimulates microglia to secrete exosomal miR32-3p and activates GABAergic neuron. In Aim 2,
I will investigate the pathological mechanism by which the activated GABAergic neuron enhances brain
metastasis by promoting GABA shunt of tumor cells. Aim 3 is to test the efficacy of inhibitors for GABA
transporter on nicotine-stimulated brain metastasis.
The K99 phase of the proposed research will be pursued at Wake Forest University (WFU), an interactive
cancer biology community, and a wealth of intellectual and technical resources. The training plan, under the
mentorship of Dr. Watabe, outlines a comprehensive strategy for acquiring the technical and the professional
skills required to complete the proposed research and prepare me for an independent research career.
Experienced six members of my mentor team will provide training in new techniques and analyses of data. By
taking advantage of Wake Forest‘s exceptional resources for professional development, I will also improve my
skills for communication, management, and leadership. The training I obtain at WFU will equip me to lead a
laboratory that merges diverse approaches to investigate the mechanisms of initiation and progression to
clinically significant brain metastasis and identify innovative strategies for prevention and treatment of brain
metastasis."
10892016,"Project Summary:
Heart failure (HF) affects 6.2 million patients in the United States and was responsible of 13.4% of deaths in
2018 costing about 30.7 billion USD in 2012, and about 80% of all the patients with HF are >65 years old. Clinical
manifestations include shortness of breath and peripheral edema. Diuretics are indicated to treat edema in
patients with HF, however, its use is limited in patients with compromised kidney function. Peripheral edema is
associated with pain, heavy legs, limited mobility, and poor quality of life, increasing the risk of cellulitis, and
wounds. Heart failure was identified in up to 44% of patients with venous ulcers. The chronic use of compression
stockings in HF patients has potential benefits such as a better control of the edema, decreasing the need for
diuretics, improving mobility, prevention of progression of venous disease, and prevention of venous ulcers. To
date, no major HF guidelines recommend in favor or against compression stockings in HF patients.
The objective of this R21 proposal is to study the role of the compression stockings in preventing edema and
venous disease in heart failure patients.
Our hypothesis We hypothesize that the use of compression stockings will prevent developing or worsening
venous disease (venous reflux, and venous ulcers), improving the edema of the lower extremities, mobility, and
quality of life in HF patients without increasing the risk of HF deterioration, hospitalization, or death
In Aim 1 we are planning to randomize patients to high degree (20-30 mmHg) vs. low degree (10-15 mmHg)
compression stockings for 3 months and evaluate for clinical sign and symptoms of deterioration of heart failure,
as well as need to change in diuretic therapy at the end of the therapy.
In Aim 2a we are planning to evaluate if high degree compression stockings are associated with a difference in
time of valve closure (venous reflux) by venous duplex ultrasound at 3 months.
In Aim 2b we are planning to evaluate if high degree compression stockings are associated with a difference in
clinical signs of venous disease at 3 months.
In Aim 3 we are planning to evaluate if high degree compression stockings are associated with improvement in
mobility and quality of life at 3 months.
The contribution with this project is significant as edema and venous disease are very morbid condition in patients
with heart failure, and a simple and preventive measure such as compression stockings, could be safe and easily
implemented.
Our project is innovative as we are planning to use compression stockings in patients with heart failure,
something that physicians are reluctant to use due to possible decompensation and fluid overload. On the other
hand, we consider that it could be easily implemented and prevent advanced venous disease."
10794243,"ABSTRACT
Soft-tissue sarcomas are heterogeneous tumors that originate from cells belonging to the
mesenchymal lineages, and that affect almost 200,000 individuals worldwide each year. The most
aggressive and metastatic sub-types in adults are those with complex karyotypes and multiple
genetic aberrations. The overall survival of these sarcoma patients has not greatly improved in
recent years, and alternative approaches to chemotherapy and radiotherapy such as
immunotherapy have so far provided only marginal benefits. Novel therapeutic advances for UPS
are hindered by the lack of knowledge about the functional consequences of the complex genomic
alterations found in patients and limited characterizations of the tumor microenvironment (TME),
which would reveal non-cell-autonomous mechanisms critical to sarcoma progression.
Experimental tools and available animal models currently do not address these limitations.
However, appropriate models could facilitate the efficient discovery of new targets and immune-
based therapies for these tumors, which have relatively low incidence and for which the
development of clinical trials is often challenging. Accordingly, we propose to generate sarcoma
mouse models that encompass the actual somatic aberrations observed in patients. Moreover,
we will use these models to facilitate studies of treatment response and TME composition. The
employment of these new models, together with newer technologies such as single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq), CyTOF and Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) will ultimately illuminate
the key expression profile of the single tumor cells, mechanisms of metastasis, resistance to
conventional treatments and TME components that may influence such mechanisms. Ultimately,
these models will translate to the clinic more effective therapeutic combinations and regimens.
Successful completion of this project will i) generate new mouse models of complex sarcoma that
recapitulate the genetic defects found in human sarcoma and provide a comprehensive functional
characterization of these models (Aim 1), ii) illuminate the expression profile of the tumor cells
and discrete sub-groups of them, to understand how these profiles influence the TME composition
(Aim 2), iii) test how these models respond to different radiotherapy administration schedules in
the heterogeneous settings of distinct tumor genetics, expression profiles and environmental
elements (Aim 3)."

the foundation for a sustainable biomedical and behavioral (B&B) research training program that will more than
double the number of underrepresented (UR) students graduating with a STEM degree and pursuing a Ph.D.
in B&B research. This goal will be achieved by the following: 1) Increase the pool of URISE-eligible applicants
from 9 students to 20 students who enroll in course work, participate in workshops, attend seminars and
interact with outside speakers to ensure that URISE scholars are prepared for graduate school by 2026; 2)
Institute programs and initiatives that foster and promote the development and preparation of well-trained
biomedical scientists that have the technical and operational skills for post-graduate success; 3) Select 3
URISE scholars per year from the URISE-eligible pool; 4) 100% (15 or 15) of URISE scholars will graduate by
2026 and 5) 70% (10 of 15) of URISE scholars will matriculate to Ph.D. programs in B&B research within three
years of graduating from the URISE program. During the 2021-2026 funding cycle, URISE scholars will be
selected from students who are majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, psychology, health sciences,
physics, and engineering. URISE scholars will complete the core requirements for their major, extramural
activities, workshops, and additional coursework. Extramural activities and workshops are focused on graduate
school preparation, including responsible conduct of research, enhancing reproducibility, professional skills,
and financial literacy. URISE scholars will receive extensive career and graduate school advising and will be
provided with numerous opportunities to enhance their written and oral communication skills. Opportunities will
be provided for URISE scholars to help build a strong cohort of STEM scholars through social and cultural
activities. Most importantly, URISE scholars will receive extensive year-round research training both at FLC

Volumetric muscle loss (VML) injuries are debilitating traumas that result in permanent loss of muscle function.
Moreover, VML injuries are often compounded by damage to multiple tissues including connective and nervous
tissue. Peripheral nervous system damage can result in denervation that limits force generation while the
disruption of muscle fibers at the musculotendinous junction (MTJ), where most muscle injuries occur, can further
ablate the transfer of muscle-generated force to the skeletal system. Unfortunately, many therapeutic
approaches for VML solely focus on skeletal muscle, neglecting neighboring tissues that are essential for
function. Despite this clear clinical need, therapies to treat combined VML/MTJ injuries are lacking. Therefore,
the central objective of this proposal is to apply a tissue engineering scaffold mimicking MTJ structure to promote
innervated functional regeneration of VML/MTJ injuries. We will take an innovative biomaterials-based approach
that builds on our team’s recent development of a 3D aligned and electrically conductive collagen-
glycosaminoglycan (CG) scaffold that recapitulates both the anisotropic extracellular matrix (ECM) organization
and electrical excitability of native skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that an engineered biomaterial with spatially-
defined microenvironmental cues paired with bioreactor preconditioning of myogenic and neuronal cells will
enable regeneration of clinically relevant VML/MTJ injuries. We will test this hypothesis through two aims: 1)
Determine the combined ability of 3D scaffold alignment and electrical conductivity to drive in vitro myogenesis
of muscle-derived cell (MDC) and neural stem cell (NSC) co-cultures, and 2) Determine the ability of 3D multi-
compartment scaffolds with co-cultured MDCs and NSCs to guide repair of MTJ VML injuries. We will first build
on recent work demonstrating the utility of co-culturing neural and muscle progenitor cells to improve in vitro
myogenesis by determining if biomimetic scaffold cues, including 3D structural alignment and electrical
conductivity, can further amplify this process. We will evaluate MDC and NSC viability, proliferation, cytoskeletal
organization, and myotube and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation within scaffolds both with and without
electrical and/or mechanical stimulation. Anisotropic CG scaffolds with spatially-defined electrical conductivity
and mechanics to recapitulate the biophysical properties of the MTJ interface will then be implanted, with or
without bioreactor preconditioned MDCs and NSCs, in rat tibialis anterior VML/MTJ defects. Repair metrics will
include immunohistochemistry, quantification of force generation, and analysis of gait biomechanics over 24
weeks. Our proposal directly addresses the treatment of challenging and clinically relevant VML injuries while
answering previously intractable biological questions, including understanding of how scaffold structural and
electrical signals can synergistically promote myogenesis. Overall, our approach will establish an innovative
paradigm for regenerating multi-tissue interfaces and innervating electrically-responsive tissue."
10786065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Beyond the role that individual factors (e.g. age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status) play in the
progression of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD), neighborhood factors (e.g. social and built
environments) may affect cognitive health. Critically, although African American and Hispanic individuals face
the highest and most disproportionate risk for ADRD, research has traditionally excluded diverse populations.
Given historic and current patterning of healthy neighborhood factors by racial and socioeconomic
characteristics, these features may partially explain observed disparities in ADRD risk. To date there has been
no research on the role of neighborhood environments in disparities in ADRD risk.
In this study, we propose to leverage and extend extensive longitudinal data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA) to address major gaps in research on neighborhoods and disparities in ADRD. We
propose to undertake large-scale collection, processing, and distribution of new neighborhood data within
MESA. Our main objective is to identify unique patterns of neighborhood change related to the causes of
prevalence and disparities in cognitive decline and dementia. We will attain our main objective by (Aim 1)
characterizing dynamic, longitudinal neighborhood social and built environment variables (survey-based and
GIS-derived) relevant to cognition for residential addresses of a MESA; (Aim 2) examining associations of
neighborhood environmental characteristics with cognition and clinically relevant ADRD outcomes; (Aim 3)
investigate determinants of disparities in ADRD outcomes by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity and
assess the contribution of neighborhood environments.
This project is poised to provide robust new evidence about pathways and links between neighborhood
environments and cognitive outcomes, with important implications for built environment science, ADRD
progression research, and policies to support healthy aging. Aim 1 will create the most comprehensive
longitudinal neighborhood dataset on a diverse sample with detailed cognitive and ADRD outcomes for
widespread dissemination to a network of researchers. Analyses in Aim 2 will contribute to developing
substantive theory on the role of neighborhoods in ADRD progression and provide guidance for urban planners
to design neighborhoods that support healthy aging. Aim 3 examines component contributions to racial
disparities in cognition and ADRD. Through this, we expect to identify actionable, community and clinical
interventions to address and remediate racial and socioeconomic inequalities derived from the unequal
distribution of environmental supports for healthy aging. We expect this evidence to support and amplify efforts
to reduce disparities."
10781921,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The traffic patterns established by transport vesicles are of fundamental importance for protein localization,
modification, and function within eukaryotic cells. Cargo transported by these vesicles is delivered through the
fusion of the vesicle with the membrane of a target organelle or, in the case of exocytosis, the plasma
membrane. Membrane fusion is executed by SNARE complexes that bridge the vesicle and target
membranes. The formation of these complexes requires that four different SNARE proteins, anchored in two
different membranes, undergo a coupled folding and assembly reaction during which the SNARE motifs zipper
up into a parallel four-helix bundle. This complicated process is inefficient in vitro, and is certain to be even
more challenging in vivo, where it must compete with the formation of various non-cognate and off-pathway
SNARE complexes. We hypothesize that SNARE complex assembly reactions in the cell are orchestrated by
`topologically aware' chaperones called multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs). We furthermore propose
that the key task of catalyzing four-helix bundle formation falls to the Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, working
together with—and sometimes as integral subunits of—the MTCs. Therefore, the overarching goal of this
proposal is to achieve an improved structural and mechanistic understanding of MTC and SM function,
especially as they relate to one another, in the assembly of membrane fusogenic SNARE complexes. Aim 1 is
focused on SM proteins with the goal of characterizing their precise catalytic role in SNARE complex
assembly. Principally through the use of X-ray crystallography and complementary single-molecule optical
tweezers experiments, we will determine the structures and thermodynamic stabilities of SM-bound SNARE
assembly intermediates. In Aims 2 and 3, we broaden our focus to include MTCs. In Aim 2, we will investigate
the simplest known MTC, the yeast Dsl1 complex, and its interactions with SNAREs and the SM protein Sly1.
Cryo-EM studies of arrested SNARE assembly intermediates in complex with both the Dsl1 complex and Sly1
are designed to reveal how the Dsl1 complex and Sly1 collaborate. In Aim 3, we will turn our attention to the
homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, a well-studied MTC that is required for fusion at
late endosomes and lysosomes/vacuoles. Importantly, HOPS contains an SM protein as an integral subunit,
making it an ideal system for studying MTC–SM collaboration. In order to elucidate how HOPS organizes
SNAREs for assembly, we will expand our ongoing cryo-EM studies of HOPS to include bound SNAREs and
SNARE assembly intermediates. Overall, this research program has the potential to revolutionize our
mechanistic understanding of chaperoned SNARE complex assembly, with potentially profound implications for
elucidating diverse biological processes and their subversion during infection and disease. While the proposed
work is more fundamental than applied, it will lay a foundation for efforts to manipulate trafficking and other
processes entailing membrane fusion, with potential future applications to therapeutic intervention."

Severe impairments in interpersonal functioning are hallmarks of personality disorders. Borderline personality
disorder (BPD), for example, is characterized by inability to maintain relationships, inflexibility in dealing with
changes in relationships, and heightened needs to control and manipulate others. Avoidant personality disorder
(AvPD), in contrast, is primarily marked by social withdrawal and avoidance, as well as reduced sense of control
in social relationships. While social neuroscience has been growing rapidly in recent years, the complexity of
human social interactions has not been well quantified with computational models, particularly as applied to
personality disorders. The overarching aim of this project is to utilize novel computational models and paradigms,
combined with 7-Tesla imaging and brain connectivity measures, to capture the neural computations underlying
proactive and dynamic social behaviors in BPD, AvPD, and healthy controls (HC; n=60 per group). Specifically,
we will focus on two novel and complex social behaviors that mimic real-life social interaction: 1) social
controllability, the ability to exert control over one’s social environment and, 2) social navigation, the process of
navigating dynamically changing social relationships. In Aim 1, we will examine the computational and neural
mechanisms of social controllability in BPD and AvPD using a social exchange paradigm in which participants
either could or could not influence their partners’ monetary offers in a novel computational framework. We will
capture key parameters such as estimated controllability (), sensitivity to norm violation (), and beliefs about
control. In Aim 2, we will identify neurocomputational indices of dynamic social relationships in BPD and AvPD,
using a novel social interaction game in which participants interact and develop relationships with virtual
characters. We will devise novel measures that track the trajectories of social relationships and geometrically
quantify the overall structure of individuals’ two-dimensional social space framed by power and affiliation. In Aim
3, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches and the neurocomputational parameters derived
from Aims 1 & 2 to predict each participant’s diagnosis/group label (BPD, AvPD, or HC) and patients’ symptom
severity. Upon successful completion of these aims, this project will provide important neurocomputational
characterization for proactive social behaviors and how they might break down in BPD and AvPD, potentially
breaking new grounds and filling critical knowledge gaps for social neuroscience and computational psychiatry
research. The resulting paradigms, models, and findings will be critical for a wide range of personality and other
psychiatric disorders. Thus, the proposed neurocomputational framework could parameterize social interactions,
providing novel quantitative measures of social pathology, treatment change, and the nature of patient-
psychotherapist interactions."
10789928,"Abstract: Bumped-Kinase Inhibitor Drug Development for Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasma gondii infection is the most common known parasitic infection and causes systemic infections,
particularly severe in immunocompromised humans, that damage the central nervous system. No clear
beneficial therapy exists for pregnant women, who are experiencing new infections and possible fetal infection.
Bumped-kinase inhibitors (BKIs) target Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 1, necessary for cell entry and
growth of T. gondii. We have developed and shown proof-of-concept for treating Toxoplasma gondii CNS
infections and pregnancy infections with BKIs. However, our late leads still have some issues such as optimal
CNS penetration and metabolites associated with safety issues. In Aim 1 of the proposed work, we will
develop BKIs that retain high systemic concentrations and distribution to both the central nervous system
(CNS) AND the fetus with acceptable safety attributes for use in pregnancy. This work will be aided by the
extensive knowledge of our leads, computational predictions, and iterative experimentation addressing the few
remaining issues. We will elucidate the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics (PK/PD) associated with
efficacious T. gondii therapy, an area that hasn’t been explored before in toxoplasmosis therapy. Once optimal
BKIs are obtained and the optimal PK/PD known, in Aim 2 we will test BKI late leads for effects in rodent and
ovine models of congenital toxoplasmosis. The pregnant mice T. gondii congenital model will be useful for
prioritizing compounds to further study in the pregnant sheep T. gondii congenital model. The pregnant sheep
T. gondii congenital model is a superior model for human T. gondii congenital therapy than the mouse model
because of similarities in sheep and humans (vs. mice) in length of gestation, numbers of fetuses per
pregnancy, similarities in outcomes of congenital infection, and immune recognition of T. gondii. Our
deliverables will be late lead BKIs, with demonstrated safety and efficacy in two animal models of congenital
toxoplasmosis, to advance to GLP toxicity testing required for IND approval. Our likelihood for success is
greatly improved by our collective knowledge from working on these compounds for cryptosporidiosis and the
well-established scientific team together with advisors and consultants from our partners at PATH, AbbVie, and
Bayer, who have decades of experience in pharmaceutical development."
10814381,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The high and increasing prevalence as well as the staggering social and financial costs of Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) emphasize the importance of finding strategies to prevent or slow their
progression. Here we aim to elucidate the basic biology of neuronal maintenance and energy homeostasis to
enable us to design new therapeutic strategies independent of tau or beta-amyloid theories. Almost all neurons
are born early in life and require an active neuroprotection program for their survival in response to the myriad
of internal and external challenges they face throughout life. NMNAT2 is a bifunctional protein that we and
others have identified as an important neuronal maintenance factor. NMNAT2 synthesizes nicotinamide
mononucleotide (NAD+) and serves as a molecular chaperone for day-to-day axonal function and to protect
neurons from proteinopathies such as hyperphosphorylated tau. In AD patients, NMNAT2 abundance is
greatly reduced to less than 50% of normal level and its level correlates with cognitive function. We found that
deleting NMNAT2 from mouse cortical glutamatergic neurons results in AD/ADRD-like phenotypes, such as
glucose hypometabolism, axonopathy and neuroinflammation. The current mouse and human results strongly
support a causal relationship between NMNAT2 hypofunction and neurodegeneration.
 Axonal degeneration is a key step in AD/ADRD and many neurodegenerative diseases. Axonal
transport plays critical roles in neuronal function and survival and is extremely energy demanding. Abnormal
axonal transport is an early defect in axons destined to degenerate. Increasing evidence reveals dysregulated
glucose metabolism in AD. Our preliminary studies suggest that NMNAT2 plays a critical role in fast axonal
transport by maintaining axonal energy homeostasis. Deleting NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons reduces
glycolysis while at the same time augmenting the pentose phosphate. These findings raise the following
questions: Does NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons play essential roles in maintaining energy homeostasis for
normal axonal function? Does glucose hypometabolism caused by loss of NMNAT2 cause axonopathy? Will
supplement strategies bypassing NMNAT2 support neurons and attenuate axonopathy? To answer these
questions, we propose the following aims:
1. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 is required in cortical neurons for axonal transport.
2. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 contributes to axonal energy homeostasis.
3. Test the hypothesis that NMNAT2 in cortical neurons is essential for glucose metabolism
 The knowledge gained from our proposed studies will help us gain mechanistic understanding into how
NMNAT2 contributes to active neuronal maintenance and will provide necessary insights to assist in drug
discovery using NMNAT2 as a therapeutic target for neurodegeneration."

The objectives of this exploratory R21 proposal are to identify and characterize an intercellular communication
signal that induces biofilm formation in cooperation with quorum sensing in the human fungal pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans. C. neoformans is a basidiomycetous fungus that causes cryptococcal
meningoencephalitis (CME), one of the most fatal and common opportunistic infections affecting people with
HIV/AIDS. Like many other infectious microbes, C. neoformans forms biofilm-like structures known as
cryptococcoma in vivo. However, we know very little about the structural requirements for biofilms or their
genetic regulation in this fungal pathogen, partly because Cryptococcus forms biofilms poorly under laboratory
conditions, and partly because this basidiomycete does not carry homologues of any known biofilm-relevant
proteins established in ascomycetes like Saccharomyces and Candida species.
Here we found that disruption of a transcription repressor Ssn6 in a mating-type a strain, but not in the
congenic mating-type α strain, leads to robust biofilm formation in C. neoformans, which provides an entry
point for us to investigate genetic regulation of biofilm formation in this fungus. Interestingly, ssn6a biofilm
colonies induce the nearby ssn6α colonies to also form biofilms and this process is independent of the mating
pheromone. We discovered that the intercellular communication system which activates biofilm formation
requires the quorum-sensing molecule Qsp1 and an unknown peptide-based signaling molecule. Here we
propose to (1) identify the secreted biofilm signaling molecule and (2) elucidate the pathway involved in biofilm
formation activated by this signaling molecule. The proposed work is expected to yield insights into this layered
communication system that regulates such complex community behaviors in a clinically important fungal
pathogen. We also expect to identify novel biofilm structural proteins like adhesins in Cryptococcus in this
process, which will fill the critical gap in our knowledge about biofilm formation and regulation in
basidiomycetes. The findings from this exploratory research will also provide a foundation for future
investigation of the impact of biofilm regulation on cryptococcal pathogenesis."

Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, exhibits substantial heterogeneity
in cellular identity, or differentiation state. In this disease, cancer cell identity correlates with critical clinical
parameters, including patient prognosis, intrinsic sensitivity to therapy, and acquisition of drug resistance.
Thus, there is an unmet need to obtain a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms controlling LUAD
identity. A major rationale for this proposal is that a mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay
between lineage specifiers and oncogenic signaling pathways in LUAD must be achieved before such
therapeutic strategies can be developed. The immediate goal of this application is to test the central hypothesis
that lineage specifiers and oncogenic signaling pathways coordinately modulate LUAD identity and growth.
This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims via an integrative experimental approach employing
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), organoid cultures, human PDX models/cell lines and clinically
relevant pathway inhibitors: (1) Identify mechanisms by which FoxA1/2 promote tumorigenesis and activate a
mixed-lineage state in NKX2-1-positive lung adenocarcinoma. (2) Identify mechanisms by which oncogenic
signaling pathways regulate identity in NKX2-1-negative lung adenocarcinoma."

T cells are major clinical targets for anti-inflammatory treatment of persistent ocular pain induced by anterior eye
diseases such as dry eye, yet identification of which T cell subsets drive the pathophysiology of anterior eye
disease remains a topic of intensive preclinical investigation. Emerging data shows that a relatively recently
discovered pro-inflammatory subset of T cells that rarely re-enter circulation dominate the T cell niche on the
ocular surface of humans but are almost nonexistent in preclinical models of dry eye disease. Establishment of
these tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) in the eye requires pathogen exposure or vaccination, and because
we house laboratory rodents in unnaturally clean environments, they have extremely limited exposure to
pathogens. This lack of immunologic experience has precluded the use of extant rodent models to investigate the
impact of TRM in neuro-immune mechanisms of anterior eye disease, and the potential interactions between TRM
and nociceptors in ocular inflammation and pain remains a pressing gap in knowledge. We propose to address
this gap by infecting mice with a clinically relevant ocular pathogen to establish a population of “human- like” TRM
in the eye that can be specifically targeted for activation or depletion. Using this rodent model, we will modulate
the activity/presence of TRM and/or nociceptors in the anterior eye to test the central hypothesis that TRM and
nociceptors engage in bidirectional neuro-immune interactions that cause ocular pain and inflammation.
Additionally, these animals will be used in a desiccating stress model of dry eye disease with and without
depletion of resident (TRM), and/or circulating virus-specific CD8+ memory T cells, to determine the relative
impact of these experience-dependent memory immune cell populations on dry eye pathophysiology. These
studies will gain critical insights into neuro-immune mechanisms that drive the pathophysiology of anterior eye
disease and determine how prior viral infection shapes the manifestation of subsequent neuro-inflammation.
This work will inform innovative avenues for the treatment of human ocular pain and inflammation and bear broad
impact for the field of neuro-immunology through first-ever investigation of TRM interactions with the sensory
nervous system."

The demand for kidney transplantation continues to greatly exceed the supply, and living kidney donors remain
a critical source of organs for their loved ones. Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) has decreased in
the US since 2004, and importantly, significant geographic disparities in likelihood of LDKT have been
identified, with the southeastern US having the lowest rates. Transplant candidate-related and potential living
donor-related factors, including difficulty asking family/friends to donate on one’s behalf and lack of knowledge
about the donation process, respectively, have been implicated in lower donation rates. Programs have been
developed to separate the advocacy role from the transplant candidate in order to overcome barriers
associated with asking someone to donate on one’s behalf, and have demonstrated increases in living donor
inquiries. Importantly, these programs were developed and implemented in resource-intense urban settings
that afforded ready access to high-speed internet, cell phone service and close geographic proximity to urban-
based transplant centers, limiting their generalizability to low-resource settings like the rural, southeastern US.
Moreover, these programs failed to include targeted interventions to improve potential living donor comfort with
the evaluation process, impeding sustained increases in LDKT. Living donor selection is a comprehensive
process that begins with potential donor inquiry, screening of potential donors for absolute contraindications to
donation (e.g. solitary kidney), evaluation, and ultimately approval. This process is time-consuming,
overwhelming, and involves complex and frequent interactions with the healthcare system. Not surprisingly,
many potential living donors withdraw from the process prior to approval and donation. Multiple studies have
demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of patient navigator programs in improving outcomes, including more
efficient use of healthcare systems. In order to address knowledge gaps within existing programs designed to
increase living donation, we utilized the RE-AIM framework to develop and implement a novel Living Donor
Navigator Program (LDN). LDN combines advocacy-training to overcome barriers in initiating conversations
with and identification of potential living donors with the use of non-clinical navigators to guide donors through
the evaluation process. Early results indicate a 7-fold increase in likelihood of an approved donor among LDN
participants compared to non-participants; however, assessment of LDN reach and adoption demonstrated
that geographic disparities among participants exist. We hypothesize that expansion of the LDN program to
include telehealth delivery will overcome geographic disparities in access and facilitate sustained increases in
living donation. To this end, we will address the following aims: 1) Conduct qualitative assessments to identify
facilitators for LDN telehealth participation, 2) Implement a LDN telehealth program, and 3) Compare the
effectiveness of telehealth LDN model vs. standard of care for increasing living kidney donation."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most prevalent and challenging cancers to cure. Each year, nearly 12,000 new
cases of GBM are diagnosed in the US, with the overall median survival being only 12 to 18 months. GBM rarely
metastasizes to other organs; however, there is no effective treatment for GBM tumors. Standard therapies with
surgery combined with adjuvant radiation and FDA-approved drugs can add a few months to median survival
but cannot prevent the recurrence of GBM. For recurrent GBM (rGBM), prognosis is even more dismal. Repeated
surgery is often not recommended since patients have already gone through it during the treatment of initial
GBM, and the efficacy of other treatment options is very limited. Laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) is an
emerging technique for minimally invasive treatment of rGBM. By introducing a slender laser probe into a brain
tumor, LITT can ablate the tumor tissue percutaneously using laser radiation. However, existing LITT devices
which often set the tip of a laser probe at the core of the tumor are inadequate to achieve conformal ablation (i.e.,
ablation with the maximum tumor coverage and minimum collateral damage), especially when tumors are large,
irregularly shaped, or multifocal. Hence, to achieve conformal ablation and improve the efficacy of LITT, we
propose a novel robot to deliver thermal radiation at multiple locations inside a brain tumor. We will develop a
novel steerable laser interstitial thermotherapy (SLIT) robot with a slender footprint and a custom-
designed flexible laser ablation probe. We will introduce SLIT to the peripheral of a brain tumor through a small
burr hole, manipulate SLIT around critical structures, and perform ablation at targets that are planned by
clinicians under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All aspects of new procedure will be
remotely monitored and controlled by clinicians using intra-operative MRI and thermometry (MRT) to ensure
precision and safety. In this project, we will 1) Design and develop an MR-compatible steerable robot with a
flexible ablation probe, 2) Develop software that enables planning and control of multi-site tumor ablation, and
3) Evaluate the safety and functionality of SLIT using clinically relevant models. We have formed a
multidisciplinary team with expertise in minimally invasive surgical robots, biomedical fiber lasers,
neurosurgery, neurosurgical devices, neuropathology, advanced MR imaging, animal models, and
neuroradiology to successfully conduct the proposed studies. LITT for rGBM therapy will serve as a model for
technology development, while the outcome will generate a transformative platform with applications to many
neurosurgical procedures that require dexterous minimally invasive access to brain lesions."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in the U.S., disproportionately impacts persons of
lower socioeconomic position (SEP) -- a disparity that has been attributed to heightened exposures to both traffic-
related air pollution (TRAP) and chronic social stressors. Many epidemiologic and toxicologic studies have shown
that exposures to chronic stress can vastly increase susceptibility to TRAP, though growing evidence now
suggests that TRAP may also strongly impact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function and acute
stress response, complicating the directionality and interpretation of interactions. It is critical to disentangle these
two models, to develop more biologically-grounded epidemiologic model structures, and refine the design of
space-time exposure metrics for both stress and pollution. Ultimately, this work will help to better identify
susceptible populations, and identify effective interventions to improve health and reduce health disparities.
Doing so is challenging, however, as both stress and TRAP are complex exposures with diverse multi-systemic
impacts. Stress is shown to strongly impact immune, endocrine, and metabolic function, but effects are highly
time-sensitive, as acute and chronic stress manifest very differently. TRAP is a highly complex mix of chemicals,
each with very different physiologic impacts. In this ViCTER proposal, we establish an interdisciplinary team to
quantify and compare chronic and acute stress, TRAP, and their multiple interactions, in shaping cardiovascular
function. We are uniquely poised to map this unexplored terrain, as accomplished senior investigators in
atmospheric science and mechanical engineering (Wexler), cardiovascular regulation and autonomic function
(Chen), and exposure science and social-environmental epidemiology (Clougherty). To do so, we will use a
unique TRAP delivery system with real-time concentration and chemical composition measures, a well-validated
model for generating chronic and acute stress responses in rats, time-resolved measures of cardiovascular
function (telemetry), and biological profiling at multiple time points for chronic and acute stress markers (e.g.,
cortisol, CRP, cytokines), to quantify and compare directionality in the two conceptual models described above.
We hypothesize that: (1) TRAP composition (light- vs. heavy-duty vehicles) differently impact cardiovascular
function; (2) Chronic stress may heighten animals’ cardiovascular response to TRAP, over the course of study;
(3) TRAP may compromise animals’ cardiovascular resilience to stress challenge. This study will establish an
interdisciplinary team with complementary expertise to examine complexities in the interactions among stress
and pollution exposures – an issue profoundly relevant to health disparities in under-served and marginalized
communities, especially for CVD, the leading cause of death. The team will work together to integrate the results
of the three aims into hypotheses for subsequent R01 applications."

Nearly 35,000 succumb to advanced prostate cancer each year, making it the second leading cause of cancer
death among men. The development of oral specialty drugs targeting specific molecules has led to a paradigm
shift in which men can receive treatment for their prostate cancer at home. Oral specialty drugs, such as
abiraterone and enzalutamide, have similar efficacy as physician administered chemotherapy with less toxicity
and are the most common first-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer as of 2015. This new treatment
paradigm has been accompanied by concurrent changes in in the delivery system. Increasingly, prescriptions
for oral specialty drugs are dispensed directly by the urologist or medical oncologist in their office (referred to
as “physician dispensing”). Patients may benefit from this delivery model as it places the onus for authorization
and identification of financial assistance on the prescribing physician. Combined with the integration and
coordination implied by dispensing at the point of care, this delivery model may improve access, timeliness and
adherence to these specialty drugs. However, financial incentives associated with physician dispensing,
through a margin generated by each prescription fill, may foster prescribing behaviors promoting utilization that
undermine the value of this delivery system change, such as use of these therapies in patients with preexisting
conditions that predispose them to adverse drug effects. To understand the implications of this delivery model
for patients, we propose the following: (1) To measure the effects of physician dispensing on use of specialty
drugs for prostate cancer; (2) To determine the impact of physician dispensing of specialty drugs for prostate
cancer on financial outcomes and coping behaviors; and (3) To measure the relationship between physician
dispensing of specialty drugs for prostate cancer and patient safety. Results from this study will have real-world
implications for men with advanced prostate cancer, who are naturally interested in getting the highest quality
cancer care while avoiding the financial consequences commonly associated with oral specialty drugs."

The ocular lens plays a crucial role in focusing incident light on to the retina, with aberrations in lens transparency
and mechanical properties leading to impairment of vision. Despite continuing effort, our understanding of the
various molecular pathways governing lens cytoarchitecture, homeostasis, deformability, clarity, and the
etiological mechanisms of cataract remains incomplete. We recently identified that several members of the S100
family of calcium binding proteins are abundantly expressed and exhibit distinct distribution profiles in the lens.
While expression of S100A6 and S100A10 distributed to both the lens epithelium and fibers, S100A4 distributes
discretely to lens fiber cells. Absence of S100A4 but not S100A6 or S100A10 leads to opalescent late-onset
cataract formation in a mouse model, together with the robust upregulation of S100A5, the expression of which
was otherwise undetectable in the wild type lens. Other than these new data on S100A4, we currently have no
knowledge of the role played by the S100 family of proteins in lens function. S100A4 is expressed in a cell and
tissue specific manner and is involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases. The physiological function of
S100A4 however, is poorly understood. A well-understood molecular function of S100A4 is its interaction with
non-muscle myosin II (NM II), especially NM IIA, and regulation of NM II assembly, actin polymerization,
contractile characteristics, cell migration, and plasticity. NM II plays a crucial role in lens cytoarchitecture,
mechanics, and function. Though NM IIA mutations are associated with cataract development in humans, little
is known about regulation of NM II activity in the context of lens function. While lenses derived from mature
S100A4 null mouse lenses (2 to 6 month old) remain clear and maintain normal growth and size, those from six
month-old mice exhibit impairments in assembly and phosphorylation of NM IIA, polymerization of actin, and
alterations in the levels of aquaporin-5, CLIC5, connexin-50, cell adhesive proteins (integrin-β1, NrCAM, ZO-1)
and α-crystallin, culminating in opalescent cataract formation in eight month-old mice. Based on these
preliminary and novel findings, we hypothesize that S100A4 plays a crucial role in regulating NM II assembly in
the lens, and that the absence of S100A4 disrupts NM II assembly and phosphorylation, actin polymerization,
mechanical properties, and osmotic homeostasis in the lens, leading to late onset cataract formation. To test this
hypothesis, in three interrelated specific aims, we will investigate: 1) the mechanistic role of S100A4 in regulation
of lens NM II assembly and phosphorylation, actin polymerization, cell adhesion, and lens tensile properties, 2)
the disruption of osmoregulation and solute carrier transport mechanisms underlying cataractogenesis in
S100A4 null lenses, and 3) the effects of rescuing expression of S100A4 in S100A4 null mouse lens fibers (using
a transgenic approach) on cytoskeletal integrity and lens phenotype. These novel and interrelated studies are
expected to uncover the significance of S100A4 and other members of the S100 family proteins in lens function,
which are known to participate in the pathophysiology of several diseases."

in symptomatic concussions and asymptomatic subconcussions and may increase risk for later-life cognitive
decline and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, as well as dementia from neurodegenerative disease, including
chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite many scientific advances in this area, critical knowledge gaps exist
due to: small samples, cross-sectional designs, focus on male professional American football players,
recruitment biases, and reliance on retrospective reports from informants. Many questions remain, such as: What
aspects of RHI are most pertinent to these risks? Are there non-RHI factors that enhance or mitigate risk? Do
the risks generalize to women and to soccer players? Our goal is to address these limitations and examine risk
factors for, and characterize the frequency, severity, and profile of cognitive impairment, neurobehavioral
dysregulation (e.g., explosiveness, impulsivity, “short fuse”), and dementia, in female and male former soccer
players and male former American football players. We will create the Head Impact and Trauma Surveillance
Study (HITSS) by leveraging the Brain Health Registry (BHR) at the University of California, San Francisco. BHR
is an online registry for the longitudinal study of people interested in participating in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD) research, with ~70,000 participants currently enrolled. BHR participants complete
demographic and health questionnaires, medical and neurologic histories, depression scales, subjective
cognitive complaint measures, and two validated online cognitive tests. They can also have a study partner
complete additional online measures of the participant’s cognitive and functional status and neuropsychiatric
symptoms. A HITSS Module will be developed and added to BHR to assess CCS history, RHI exposure (e.g.,
positions played, age of first exposure, duration of play, era of play, soccer heading), and standardized
neuropsychiatric measures. Participants will be recruited into HITSS through an extensive national advertising
and social media outreach. We will enroll 1800 former soccer (900 female, 900 male) and 1800 male former
American football players into HITSS, across levels of play (high school, college, or elite/professional), ages 40-
75. Using the existing BHR dataset, two comparison groups (n = 1800 each) of current BHR participants without
a CCS or TBI history will be propensity-matched to the former soccer and former American football players. We
will test the hypothesis that greater cumulative RHI exposure from soccer and American football increases risk
for cognitive impairment, neurobehavioral dysregulation, and dementia, and that non-RHI factors (e.g., TBI
history, sex, race, vascular risk, cognitive reserve) will modify the effect. Data will be shared with researchers
worldwide. Findings will advance research on risk of later-life cognitive decline, neurobehavioral dysregulation,
and dementia from CCS involvement. Development of HITSS will also create: (1) a self-sustaining mechanism
for follow-up of participants in other CCS studies; (2) a longitudinal, sharable dataset of thousands of female and
male, active and former CCS athletes; and (3) a readiness registry of CCS athletes for future research."
10834873,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In low oxygen conditions, such as the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors, cells cannot perform
mitochondrial respiration and rely solely on glycolysis for ATP generation. Thus, to overcome this deficit in energy
production, cells require mechanisms to enhance ATP generation in response to hypoxia. We discovered that in
hypoxic yeast cells, the enzymes of the glycolysis pathway, which are diffusely localized in the cytosol under
normoxic conditions, organize into non-membrane-bound structures we term Glycolytic (G) bodies. G bodies
constitute ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates formed by phase separation. G body formation is correlated
with increased glucose consumption and cell survival and proliferation under hypoxia. Similar structures have
been observed in C. elegans and human cancer cell lines, supporting G body formation as an evolutionarily
conserved adaptive response. We hypothesize that G bodies enhance rates of glycolysis by coordinating the
multiple steps of the pathway to promote cell survival during hypoxic stress conditions. Using biochemical
purification, we have determined the protein and RNA constituents of G bodies and our genome-wide deletion
screen identified key signaling pathways that influence G body formation. A major gap in the condensate field is
the lack of direct evidence for condensate function. Our preliminary results indicate that G bodies exhibit
enhanced glycolytic enzyme activity, thus supporting a functional role for these novel RNP condensates. In this
proposal, we will employ a diverse array of experimental strategies to investigate G body activity, physiological
impact, biogenesis, biophysical properties, and functional conservation. Mechanisms by which G bodies
potentiate glycolytic enzyme activity will be pursued using our purified G body in vitro system and by utilizing
novel metabolic biosensors in vivo. We will also determine the global metabolic impact of G bodies through
metabolomic approaches and investigate the genetic regulation of G body biogenesis and function mediated by
conserved energy-sensing signaling pathways. Molecular and biophysical analysis of G bodies will examine the
role of non-canonical RNA binding by glycolysis enzymes in condensate formation via phase separation. Finally,
we will take the lessons learned in yeast and apply them to human cancer cell lines and 3D spheroid cultures to
study the conservation of G body biophysical properties, biogenesis, and physiological function. Successful
outcomes of our research will reveal novel basic principles of RNP condensate regulation and function across
species and provide mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate hypoxic adaption and
cell proliferation in solid tumor microenvironments."
10833465,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The NIGMS Established Investigator (EI) R35 Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA)
proposal aims to use computational approaches to advance genomic, biological, and clinical understandings of
human disease. The research program is broadly focused on three areas of human genomics: genomic
association, biological mechanism and translational medicine. Within these areas, research in the laboratory
has focused on: 1) evaluation of disease risk of genetic variants; 2) development and application of Mendelian
randomization to infer causal relationships between complex traits and diseases; 3) evaluation of the complex
interplay between natural selection and human diseases; and 4) using human genomics to inform drug side
effect prediction. The proposed research program leverages large-scale genetic and clinical data resources,
combined with statistical methods development, building directly on our prior published research in each of the
research areas. Importantly, we have highlighted critical unmet needs, key knowledge gaps in our
understanding and important challenges to be addressed pertaining to general medical sciences research.
Over the next five years, we plan to embark on a series of studies designed to address these unmet needs and
overcome associated challenges. First, the disease risk of clinical variants at the variant level is uncertain. We
will quantify disease risk of clinical variants for human diseases by quantifying population-based penetrance in
the exome sequences of 510,000 individuals with linked electronic health record data. This research area can
refine variant interpretation. Second, little is known about the full spectrum of causal risk factors contributing to
complex diseases. We will dissect the phenotypic heterogeneity of complex diseases using a novel Mendelian
randomization framework. This research area can provide new insights into the heterogenous causes of
complex diseases. Third, little is known about the contribution of rare coding variants on deleterious load, and
its effect on human phenotypes. We will examine the interplay between fitness via the load, its constituents
and human phenotypes in a very large exome sequencing dataset (e.g. 510,000 individuals) that enables
capture of rare coding variants. This research area will provide insights into the bidirectional relationship
between deleterious load and human phenotypes, which can inform about the genetic architecture of human
phenotypes. Fourth, studies have shown that the side effects of drugs targeting genes are enriched for certain
human genomic features; however, these studies have not yet translated to useful prediction of drug side
effects. We will build a human genomics-guided priority index for drug side effect prediction using a drug side
effect dataset and a wide array of genetic features. This research area can potentially improve selection of
drug therapeutic candidates in drug development. Taken together, the research program will deliver new
biological insights and useful tools that can inform prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human diseases."

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are 1–6 bp repetitive and highly polymorphic DNA sequences. Expansions in
dozens of STRs are associated with genetic disease. However, STRs are challenging to sequence and interpret,
meaning that individuals with STR disease often go undiagnosed. In rare disease studies, it is now standard to
prioritize candidate pathogenic SNVs, indels and SVs by excluding variants that have high allele frequencies in
population-scale databases such as gnomAD. However, there is no such genome-wide database available for
large STR expansions. I will produce a publicly available STR variation community resource, stratified by
ancestry, to enable prioritization of candidate pathogenic STR expansions.
Long-read sequencing technologies from PacBio and Nanopore have been heralded as the solution to accurately
genotype long repeats because their reads can span the repetitive region. However, there are several challenges
when genotyping STRS in long-reads that are not adequately addressed by existing approaches. I will develop
a method to genotype STRs from long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. It will discover informative reads
using a combination of alignment and identifying repetitive regions in reads. It will then infer the genotype by
integrating evidence from multiple reads, informed by my investigation of biases in these technologies.
Drawing together new short and long-read computational approaches to calling STR expansions, and my
population-scale STR catalog, with an emphasis on diverse and under-served populations, this proposal will
establish a genetic diagnosis for hundreds of patients, while searching for new STR disease loci. I will analyze
patient cohorts enriched for phenotypes associated with STRs from the UDN, University of Washington, Harry
Perkins Institute of Medical Research and Children’s Mercy Hospital to solve cases and discover new disease-
associated STRs in both short and long-read sequencing."
10792652,"PROJECT SUMMARY
On July 16, 2022 “988” will become the national toll-free dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
(Pub. Law 116-172). The Lifeline receives 3.5 million calls annually and has demonstrated effectiveness at
decreasing suicidality, hopelessness, psychological distress, and suicide death. The transition from the current
10-digit Lifeline dialing code to 988—a three-digit code like 911—is projected to potentially triple call volume.
The impact of 988, however, will likely be determined by state policy responses to financing its implementation.
The federal law that creates 988 encourages states to pass user fee legislation (e.g., a flat fee monthly per every
cellphone plan holder in the state, identical to how 911 is financed). The current state policy landscape is
extremely varied. As of January 2022, four states had passed user fee legislation and many others were
considering such legislation. The proposed policy implementation project focuses on the characteristics,
determinants, and impacts of 988 user fee legislation and other policy strategies used by states to finance 988
implementation. The project’s Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize states’ 988 implementation financing
strategies and identify determinants of implementation strategy adoption; 2) Explore perceptions of the financing
determinants of 988 policy implementation success and acceptability and feasibility of legislative financing
strategies to improve implementation; and 3) Determine the effects of 988 user fee legislation on the policy
implementation outcomes of fidelity (Lifeline in-state answer rates) and reach (Lifeline state call volume rates),
the effectiveness outcomes of suicide death and emergency department use for mental health crises and self-
harm, and assess effect heterogeneity across demographic groups. These aims will be achieved by a legal
mapping study, national surveys of 250 suicide prevention stakeholders (e.g., Lifeline call center leaders), 60
semi-structured interviews, and a difference-in-differences analysis comparing trends in implementation and
effectiveness outcomes pre (2015-2021) and post (2022-2025) 988 implementation between states that did and
did not pass 988 user fee legislation. The project team has expertise in policy implementation science (Purtle,
Raghavan), suicide (Lindsey), law (Pomeranz), and quantitative policy analysis (Stuart). Practice partners
include Vibrant Emotional Health, which administers the Lifeline, and the American Foundation for Suicide
Prevention. The project is innovative because it advances the understudied area of policy-focused
implementation science. The project is significant and will have impact because it focuses on a major federal
policy in the early stage of implementation and because it will generate knowledge to inform implementation
financing decisions related to 988—which is likely to be a primary gateway to mental health crisis and suicide
prevention services for the foreseeable future. The project is aligned with NIMH’s Strategic Plan, which prioritizes
suicide prevention, and the NIMH pledge to reduce the suicide rate by 20% by 2025."
10788468,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Late-onset, non-infectious pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) occur
in up to half of all patients, are heterogeneous in etiology and in clinical course, and are deadly. Spirometry is
the cornerstone of surveillance, yet half of the pediatric HSCT population are unable to perform spirometry. As
a result, post-HSCT lung injury in children often is diagnosed in an advanced stage, where therapeutic options
are limited, damage is irreversible, and mortality is high. Early detection of lung injury after HSCT is our best
opportunity to intervene, stabilize lung-function decline, and improve outcomes, and there is an urgent need for
better diagnostics for young HSCT patients—especially for those who are unable to perform spirometry. To this
end, we have developed inhaled hyperpolarized xenon-129 (129Xe) ventilation and gas-exchange magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to spatially resolve, differentiate, and quantify small airway, interstitial, and
microvascular abnormalities. The long-term goal of this project is to lower pulmonary-related morbidity in the
pediatric HSCT population via the clinical application of 129Xe MRI as an imaging-based, lung-function
diagnostic. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that 129Xe MRI is feasible in very young children who are
unable to perform PFTs and will detect early lung involvement post-HSCT. Our approach is based on three
Specific Aims: (1) develop 129Xe gas-exchange MRI in children by imaging healthy-control volunteers and
patients with diagnosed gas-exchange impairment ages 6-18 years old; (2) phenotype post-HSCT pulmonary
involvement using 129Xe ventilation and gas-exchange MRI in children ages 6-18 years old who have received
HSCT, with longitudinal MRI and PFTs at ~100 days and 1-year post-HSCT; (3) optimize strategies for rapid
129Xe MRI in HSCT patients ages 2-5 years old. This approach is supported by our previous work and
experience showing 129Xe MRI is feasible in neonates, in young children who are unable to perform spirometry,
and in sedated patients. This approach is innovative because 129Xe gas-exchange MRI is novel to any pediatric
population, and imaging children with diagnosed gas-exchange impairment will build a conceptual bridge
between better-understood disease pathophysiology and 129Xe gas-exchange MRI findings, which will enhance
the clinical interpretation of 129Xe MRI and diagnosis of gas-exchange impairment in the HSCT population.
Preliminary data in pediatric HSCT patients revealed diffusion-barrier and RBC-transfer abnormalities,
suggesting a clinically-under-recognized, non-obstructive phenotype. This project will revolutionize clinical care
for young HSCT patients with pulmonary complications. Longitudinal trajectories of ventilation, interstitial, and
microvascular changes from 129Xe MRI post-HSCT will help in clinical risk stratification. 129Xe MRI will enable
surveillance and early detection in asymptomatic patients, phenotyping to personalize clinical management and
therapeutic approach, and robust assessment of lung function in very young children."

Among the human hematological malignancies, acute leukemia types including acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) accounts for 4% of all cancer deaths worldwide and 6% of cancer in the US population. AML is the
second most common type of diagnosed leukemia in pediatric and adult populations but most frequently
occurs in adults accounting for about 30% of all leukemia cases. Inductive therapy generally involves
intensive and genotoxic chemotherapy that can lead to high remission rates (>80%), but the long-term
survival rates for AML subtypes are only 30-50%. Indeed, the prognosis of primary resistant and relapsed
leukemia in pediatric and elderly populations remains very poor. Currently, there is a strong rationale for
immune intervention in cancers, including hematological malignancies, but recent clinical trials have
demonstrated that the benefits of immunotherapy are relegated to a small fraction (~20%) of cancer patients,
including those with AML. This prompts the need for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying
leukemic cell plasticity and adaptation, as well as developing novel therapeutic approaches to achieve more
effective and selective cure rates for primary drug-resistant and relapsed leukemia.
 Hsf1, as the master activator of the classical heat shock response and guardian of the proteome, has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer. Our preclinical studies have revealed the existence of a
coordinated, Hsf1-dependent protein homeostatic and metabolic program that, when inactivated, can lead to
cancer regression and, in particular, effective leukemia inhibition. Encouragingly, our recent studies unveiled
a highly novel and clinically significant role for Hsf1 inhibition in metabolic reprogramming and enhancement
of anti-tumor T cell immunity. This may provide a new approach to improve leukemia treatment by improving
the anti-tumor immune capacity targeting Hsf1 activity. We propose that by inhibiting supportive non-
oncogene addiction pathways, interfering with tumor-promoting metabolic reprogramming, and improving the
predicted power of anti-tumor immunity through targeting of Hsf1 activity, we can develop a valid strategy for
therapeutic interventions in leukemia. Our experimental strategy entails the following two major approaches:
1. Determine the impact of Hsf1 deletion on AML induction and explore its therapeutic potential for advanced
chemotherapy-resistant AML, and 2. Investigate the therapeutic impact of Hsf1 deletion on improved MHC-
restricted TCR or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-based immunotherapy for primary and drug
resistant/relapsed human AMLs. In summary, the long-term translational goal of the project is to test the
potential of Hsf1 targeting in human AML. It will also provide proof-of-concept for targeting Hsf1-mediated
metabolic programs for immunotherapeutic application of chemotherapy-resistant hematological
malignancies."

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing need of serological testing we propose the
development and clinical validation of a novel serological blood test, RapidQCT™, to aid in the
diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the case for other viral infections, the
immune system responds to the COVID-19 infection by developing antibodies (IgG and IgM, among
others) against the virus (SARS-COV-2). Antibody titer tests have been a valuable tool to determined
individual immunity to several infection diseases, from rubella, to measles. More importantly, as
COVID-19 vaccines become available, and a large-scale vaccination strategy will take place, the
RapidQCT will help stratify potentially hundred of millions of people and identify who is most likely to
benefit, and sparing those who will not. Because the test can be self-administered by patients, it will
also promote mobile health management of the pandemic, expanding the breadth of testing, and
protecting health care workers from exposure. Current serological tests are binary test, which only
provide a yes/no answer, and therefore unable to provide a full picture of the development the
immunity across the population. On the other hand, the RapidQCT is an easy to use and rapid test
and the first quantitative Point-of-Care (POC) anti-COVID-19 antibody titer test. The size of credit
card, it requires only one drop of blood from finger prick to asses the presence and titer level of anti-
COVID-19 antibodies. The test companion mobile app enables the tracking of the disease spreading,
progression, as well as development of the immunity throughout the population. This project will be
completed in two Phases: Phase I - Aim 1: Fabrication Streamline, Scale-Up, and Assay
Calibration. In this Aim, we will translate from the current lean development phase to the
manufacturing phase. Phase I - Aim 2: Assay Calibration: Here we will determined the assay titer
curve calibration. Phase II - Aim 1: Longitudinal monitoring of COVID-19 specific antibody titers.
The RapidQCT tests will use to follow longitudinally to three groups: Symptomatic Infected (SI),
Asymptomatic Infected (AI), and Not Infected (NI) (control). The trend of the antibody titer for each
group will be stratified by gender, age, pre-conditions, and severity of infection. Phase II - Aim 2:
Longitudinal monitoring of antibody titers in pregnancy. Immunological changes occurring in
COVID-19 positive pregnancy versus the non-pregnant population will be monitored.
This project is the result of an ongoing collaboration between Accel Diagnostics and The University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston (Houston, TX), and it is expected to deliver a clinically
validated and novel tool to manage the COVID-19 pandemic."
10796835,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ) is facilitated by glial cells, and impaired Aβ clearance is implicated in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A non-invasive assay of glial function could translate this knowledge
into improved health outcomes – leading to the development of new diagnostic tools and/or glia-targeted
therapies. Compared to other parts of the central nervous system (CNS), the retina is structurally simple. Within
the avascular layers the retina, where the only neuronal elements are photoreceptors, adjacent glia-rich and glia-
free layers can inform on glial health. In this project, functional responses to light in those avascular layers of the
retina will be monitored with optical coherence tomography (OCT), which is non-invasive and in current
widespread clinical use. Responses in the glia-rich and glia-free layers of the retina report on local shifts in water
content, which are foundational to glia-mediated waste clearance. For the first Aim of this project, we will compare
functional OCT measurements in patients with AD, patients with non-Alzheimer’s dementia, and healthy age-
matched adults. We hypothesize that the functional OCT abnormality in AD is disease-specific and is present at
early stages of the disease. Positive results would validate a new low-cost, non-invasive, and diagnostically
useful marker of AD. The second Aim of this project will use OCT to non-invasively measure retinal glial function
in genetic mouse models of disease. Knockout mice lacking the aquaporin 4 protein have impaired glial water
and waste clearance. Those mice will be crossed with APP/PS1 mice, a common model of AD based on Aβ
overproduction. Functional OCT abnormalities in these mice may be caused by limitations in glial water
movement, or by Aβ accumulation, or these features of AD may be synergistic. In vitro OCT of glial cells cultured
from those mice will clarify the glial contribution to OCT abnormalities. Positive findings from this Aim would
validate OCT as the first clinically-available tool to measure glial function, and provide a direct cell-to-mouse-to-
human translational approach for the assessment of glial function in neurodegenerative disease.
 My career goal is to become an independently-funded physician-scientist studying AD and related
dementias. This mentored career development proposal builds upon my clinical experience as a fellowship-
trained dementia neurologist, and my research experience in OCT in Alzheimer’s patients as well as (non-OCT)
imaging of the rodent retina. The University of California – Davis is the ideal location for the proposed training:
The primary mentor will guide me in planning, organizing, and executing funded human research at the
institution’s NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. The team of mentors and collaborators includes
experienced NIH-funded vision scientists who will provide training in advanced OCT techniques and Müller glial
cell culture. Additional UC Davis training and analytic resources leveraged by this proposal include graduate-
level coursework in vision science and the biology of neuroglia, the NIH-funded Clinical and Translational
Science Center, and the NIH-funded Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center."
10781930,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The human immune system produces at least 140 different antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to kill invading
bacteria. However, pathogenic bacteria use specialized pathways called two-component systems (TCSs) to
detect these AMPs and activate the expression of AMP-resistance and virulence genes. This response enables
pathogens to survive immune attacks and mount deadly infections. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms by
which peptides interact with TCSs is critical to understanding how infections progress. This knowledge could
also lead to the design of new antimicrobial drugs that interfere with TCS-mediated AMP sensing. Gram-negative
Enterobacteriaceae, such as the common pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, cause 200,000 infections and
10,000 deaths in the United States each year. The most important AMP-sensing TCS in Gram-negative
Enterobacteriaceae is named PhoPQ. Here, the membrane bound histidine kinase PhoQ senses AMPs and
responds by phosphorylating the cytoplasmic response regulator PhoP, which activates a gene expression
response. Though its interactions with a small number of model AMPs have been characterized, little is known
about the broader peptide binding and sensing capabilities of PhoQ. The major limitations have been the cost
and time required to chemically synthesize peptides and characterize their effects on TCSs using traditional
microbiological or biochemical methods. In preliminary work, we have developed a new technology named
SLAY-TCS that combines bacterial peptide display, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and next-generation
DNA sequencing to measure how S. Typhimurium PhoQ responds to millions of peptides in a single experiment.
Using SLAY-TCS, we have already revealed that PhoQ senses a far wider range of peptides than previously
known. Here, we propose to use SLAY-TCS to characterize how S. Typhimurium PhoQ responds to nearly every
AMP produced by the human immune system, and thousands of mutants thereof, in order to reveal the identities,
sequence motifs, and biophysical properties of PhoQ-activating peptides (Aim 1). We will also combine this
approach with PhoQ mutational analyses to reveal how PhoQ sensing specificity has evolved across diverse
pathogens, which may have enabled them to adapt to different biogeographical locations in vivo (Aim 2). Finally,
we will use SLAY-TCS to perform the first large-scale characterization of peptide inhibitors of PhoQ, and explore
the efficacy of the strongest inhibitors we identify in preventing S. Typhimurium virulence in primary mouse
macrophages (Aim 3). The work in Aim 3 will reveal mechanisms by which exogenously-delivered peptides can
inhibit PhoQ, and could lead to the design of novel antimicrobial therapeutics based on modified peptides in the
future. Taken together, this proposal will substantially enhance our understanding of how a dangerous family of
bacteria causes infections in humans and accelerate the design of sorely-needed antimicrobial therapeutics.
Finally, our approach could be extended to other peptide-sensing TCSs beyond PhoPQ in future studies.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a major global health problem and chronic HBV (CHB) is a major cause of
liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While antiviral therapies achieve long-term viral suppression, they
can rarely clear the infection or achieve a state of functional cure where long-term viral suppression is
maintained in the absence of treatment. Along with persistence of viral antigens, impaired HBV-specific
immunity contributes to the chronicity of infection. Chronic exposure to high levels of HBsAg may render HBV-
specific immune cells overly activated and functionally tolerized Thus, decreasing serum HBsAg could be a
valuable therapeutic strategy, due to its potential to alleviate functional exhaustion and confer immune control.
Passive transfer of antibodies is a potential strategy in CHB for their dual functionality. Antibodies differ from
direct-acting antivirals in that they can recruit immune effector functions through their Fc domains to accelerate
clearance of viruses and infected cells. In addition, immune complexes are potent immunogens that can foster
development of host immune responses. HepB monoclonal antibody (mAb)19 is a human monoclonal antibody
to the a-determinant of the extracellular loop of HBsAg and binds the major HBV serotypes. HepB mAb19
showed exceptional in vitro neutralization activity with IC50 in the nanogram range and in vivo antiviral activity
in an animal model of infection. The object of this proposal is to conduct a first-in-human dose-escalation study
of a long-acting variant of HepB mAb19 in individuals with CHB on antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogue (NRTI)
therapy. The hypothesis to be tested is that the administration of HepB mAb19-LS during suppressive NRTI
therapy will be safe and well tolerated, will lead to decreased levels of circulating HBsAg, and enhance host
innate and adaptive immune responses to HBV."
10769831,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Biomolecular condensates (BMCs) define small membraneless cellular compartments that segregate specific
proteins and nucleic acids to generate cellular functions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is
currently the method of choice to characterize BMCs in vitro and in vivo and derive the average diffusion and
trapping of molecules trapped in these condensates. Although FRAP is a good way to retrieve these important
metrics, it greatly limits our understanding of BMCs nanoscale organization and dynamics in live cells and
precludes the analysis of nanoscale BMCs (below the diffraction of light ~200 nm). Single-molecule imaging
super-resolution microscopy allows direct imaging of molecules trapped in BMCs with much greater
spatiotemporal resolution both in vitro and in live neurons, and has the potential to reveal nanoscale BMCs and
their evolution in the context of ageing and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, there are currently no
bioinformatic tools to specifically analyze BMCs at the single-molecule level. We have developed a novel tool,
named Nanoscale Spatiotemporal Indexing Clustering (NASTIC), (Wallis et al., bioRxiv, 2021, ref. 7),
which offers unprecedented insights into the dynamics of proteins undergoing liquid-liquid phase
separation/transition in large and nanoscale BMCs, in live neurons. We identified Tau and synuclein as
candidates for their ability to generate synaptic BMCs in hippocampal neurons. NASTIC analysis reveals that
Tau molecules can indeed form small nanoclusters in live hippocampal neurons in which they exhibit very low
mobility and sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol, an aliphatic alcohol used to inhibit weak molecular interactions that
mediate BMCs. NASTIC will be at the core of our ability to make a significant contribution to the understanding
of BMCs in neurons because it offers unprecedented opportunities to examine the spatiotemporal behaviour of
molecules in these condensates. NASTIC will be developed further to encompass two-color single-molecule
analysis. This will be instrumental to assess the spatiotemporal relationship of these nanoscale BMCs with their
cellular environment in 2 and 3D. We will validate our two-color NASTIC implementation with the pairwise dual
imaging of Tau wildtype and AD mutant P301L, and a-synuclein. This will allow us to decipher the co-clustering
dynamics and examine potential hierarchical dependency of one nanoBMC upon the other allowing refined
understanding of the generation of nanoscale BMCs in synapses. We anticipate that the P301L mutation will
largely increase the size and lifetime of the Tau nanoBMCs and alter their relationship with other synaptic
molecules.
The outcome of this grant will be the development and validation of an analytical pipeline that will enable
exploration of the spatiotemporal relationship of Tau and a-synuclein nanoBMCs in live hippocampal neurons.
Our project will therefore generate data and a much-needed technology opening new avenues for our
understanding of BMCs in neuronal function and AD."

The leading cause of blindness in Americans over the age of 60 is glaucoma. One risk factor for glaucoma is
central corneal thickness. The thinner the cornea, the greater the risk of developing glaucoma. Recently, we
have identified a transcription factor, POU6F2, that modulates central corneal thickness in the mouse and that
is a risk factor for human glaucoma. The Pou6f2 knockout mouse has a thinner cornea than its wild-type
littermates, while there is no apparent change in intraocular pressure. We propose that POU6F2 is expressed in
novel subclasses of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that are sensitive to glaucomatous injury. Premise: Our four
findings lead us to hypothesize that POU6F2 is in a transcriptional cascade responsible for the susceptibility and
early death of a novel collection of ON-OFF directionally selective RGC subtypes. To test this hypothesis, we
will focus on the role of POU6F2 in the response of RGCs in models of experimentally-induced and naturally-
occurring glaucoma. The proposed experiments will uncover the POU6F2 molecular cascade that induces
glaucomatous damage. We will relate our findings in the mouse to the human, through a collaboration with Dr.
Janey Wiggs and the NEIGHBORHOOD consortium, interrogating the NEIGHBORHOOD meta-dataset to define
molecular pathway associated with POU6F2 targets. We will determine if any of these downstream targets and
their associated pathways represent factors for glaucoma risk. This basic understanding of the molecular
interactions of POU6F2 will inform the rational design of strategies to improve detection of and therapy for
glaucoma."

We will develop methods and maintain software that make it radically easier for biomedical researchers to
use and understand sequencing data. The project will support our maintaining and improving our popular
“upstream” tools for analyzing sequencing data. These include the Bowtie and Bowtie 2 tools for read
alignment, the Kraken 2 tool for metagenomics classiﬁcation and the Dashing tool for genomic sketching
and comparison. We will also develop new systems that allow researchers to use these same core tools
(Bowtie, Kraken 2, Dashing) to rapidly discover and vet archived datasets. We will enable researchers to
quickly ascertain whether a dataset is of high quality, what species are present, whether contaminants
are present, what assay was performed, what datasets are similar to each other, and what datasets are
inconsistent with annotated metadata. In this way, researchers can distill relevant archived datasets, those
having the expected biological properties, in a way that does not hinge on the accuracy of the associated
metadata. Finally, we will work to develop new infrastructure for large-scale reanalysis and indexing of
archived data, ultimately yielding new “search engines” for scientiﬁc question-answering. In particular,
we will extend our past work on the Rail-RNA, recount2 and Snaptron so that we can more effectively
analyze huge collections of archived data, converting them into a variety of useful summary forms, and
than adding a layer of indexing so that users can query the summaries in the context of a scientiﬁc
investigation. We will also create new catalogs and mechanisms whereby researchers can share their
archive-assisted study designs, so that useful combinations of archived datasets, and insights into where
their metadata might be incorrect or incomplete, can be reported and shared."
10806941,"Project abstract Social connectedness is crucially important to human health, and is increasingly
recognized as such, especially in these days of “social distancing”. While strong social relationships may
confer a survivorship advantage with large effect sizes similar to those for health behaviors like diet and
exercise1, disruption and loss of social relationships carry significant health risks and mortality, including
increased risk of mental illness, cardiovascular disease, stroke, etc.2–4. However, neurobiological mechanisms
for positive and negative aspects of social connectedness have been under-studied. The κ opioid system,
which is systematically activated during stress (including social stress), and oxytocin (OT), a hormone strongly
implicated in social connectedness (and in particular, their interactions), have not been fully explored in the
contexts of positive and negative effects on social connectedness.
In the current proposal, we will investigate biological mechanisms for positive and negative mechanisms of
social connectedness (social buffering and separation), particularly in the κ opioid and oxytocin (OT) systems.
By using a unique non-human primate model, the titi monkey (Plecturocebus cupreus), we will be able to
address mechanism and causality in a way difficult or impossible to do in humans. Titi monkeys are a socially
monogamous New World primate. They exhibit all the signs of adult pair-bonding both in the wild5–7 and in the
laboratory8–10, including a preference for the familiar partner11; distress upon separation from the partner
specifically12; and the ability of the partner to buffer the stress response12; they are thus the perfect primate
model in which to study the neurobiology of pair bonding in all its aspects, including social buffering and
separation13. This socially monogamous mating system allows us to study adult attachment in adult males as
well as females, which is not possible in other common laboratory models like rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.
We have shown the separation response is modulated by opioids and that the OT system is also responsive to
separation.
 We will use C11 PET imaging and pharmacological treatments during social buffering, short term
separation, and longer-term separation to test the hypothesis that the κ opioid receptor and OT interact such
that activation of the κ system results in inhibition of OT in the nucleus accumbens during social separation and
loss; chronically, social separation and loss will result in down-regulation of κ opioid receptors and stimulation
of OT in the hypothalamus; while inhibition of κ receptors, and downstream effects on OT, are implicated in the
positive, anti-stress components of social bonds. Ultimately, this project will improve our understanding of the
neurobiological basis of social connectedness in both its positive and negative aspects, providing for
mechanistic connections to human health."

Managing any illness means also managing its economic burden, i.e., the burden due to costs of care
and productivity losses. This can financially devastate patients and their families. Not being able to
pay medical or other bills, borrowing money, using up savings, even declaring bankruptcy, are just a
few of the financial hardships patients experience. An emerging body of literature suggests that this
economic burden may also take an emotional toll. In our own program of research, we found that
cancer patients expressed worry about the cost of treatment or taking time off work when making
treatment decisions, and that one in two gynecologic cancer patients starting chemotherapy already
reported financial distress. To date, little attention has been paid to how emotional well-being
and economic burden are related. The opportunity to fully understand the underlying mechanisms
between economic burden, emotional well-being, and broader health outcomes is further hampered
by the lack of dedicated researchers and lack of ‘cross-talk’ across disciplines and fields of research.
Consequently, we do not know how to reduce the impact of the economic burden of disease and
enhance well-being. We propose to address knowledge gaps and overcome barriers to progress in
this emerging area of research by establishing the Emotional Well-Being and Economic Burden
(EMOT-ECON) Research Network. This Network will bring together multidisciplinary scientists
across institutions to take a transdisciplinary approach to answering the most urgent emotional well-
being and economic burden questions. Novel and outstanding features of the EMOT-ECON Network
include: i) leadership by a health economist and a clinical psychologist, long-term collaborators, and
colleagues. They will be supported by a leadership team that includes patients, caregivers, healthcare
providers, and policymakers who will bring unique knowledge and perspective to enrich Network
activities; ii) pilot project program portfolio of diverse funding mechanisms, including opportunities
specifically designed to recruit new investigators to the field; and iii) use of social media and an
interactive website to attract researchers, facilitate the formation of new research teams, and share
opportunities, resources and products. Our effort, designed to build research capacity in emotional
well-being and economic burden, will have a substantial impact by generating the body of knowledge
necessary to develop interventions that minimize the impact of the economic burden of disease and
enhance well-being."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects over 5 million Americans and is expected to affect 2-3-fold more in the next
few decades. AD is associated with aggregation of amyloid-beta (Ab) and phosphorylated tau proteins.
Curiously, burden of Aβ, classically considered the most important AD pathological hallmark is not enough to
indicate clinical decline or progression. For example, cognitive-normal elders may also carry high levels of Aβ
and recent clinical trials aiming to reduce Aβ have generally failed to improve patients’ conditions. Therefore,
developing biomarkers that can better predict clinical outcome and progression are needed. Confluent evidence
shows that regional brain magnetic susceptibility measured by MRI differs between AD patients and healthy
controls, and importantly such changes may predict cognitive decline. However, it is unclear what causes these
susceptibility changes in AD. While iron deposition has been widely suspected as the underlying cause, our
recent study has discovered that aggregation of Ab and tau by itself produces strong diamagnetic susceptibility,
opposite of the paramagnetic susceptibility generated by iron deposition. The opposing magnetic susceptibility
of iron and aggregated pathological proteins poses a significant challenge as current MRI-based magnetic
susceptibility mapping algorithms cannot differentiate iron from other colocalizing diamagnetic susceptibility
sources within the same voxel. Our goal is to develop a novel technique that can differentially quantify molecular
sources of magnetic susceptibility and test whether the resulting susceptibility components can serve as markers
of progressive AD pathology. We will test our techniques and hypothesis utilizing a unique capability that
combines in cranio MRI at autopsy with histological examinations. We have developed innovative histological
processing methods that allow voxel-to-voxel matching between MRI and histology in 3D, thus permitting the
examination of the relationship between magnetic susceptibility components and the neuropathology underlying
AD. If successful, our techniques and findings might ultimately allow the detection of AD-related neuropathology
at much earlier stages, permit intervention before neurons become irretrievably damaged and non-invasively
assess disease progression. These techniques, once standardized, will be highly cost-effective, widely
accessible and readily implementable in non-specialized clinical imaging centers, thus better serving the growing
population of AD patients."

 Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a driving force in microbial evolution. It is largely mediated by mobile genetic
elements, including viruses, conjugative plasmids, and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs; aka conjugative
transposons), and many bacterial genomes contain several mobile genetic elements, including ICEs and temperate phages.
Conjugative elements are well known agents that contribute to the spread of genes for antibiotic resistances, virulence,
symbiosis, metabolic functions, and more. ICEs were first discovered because they confer some of these phenotypes.
However, potential phenotypes conferred to bacteria by the vast majority of ICEs are not known. Our recent work
indicates that ICEs confer beneficial phenotypes that extend well beyond those of some of the previously characterized
ICEs, and that some of these phenotypes involve functional interactions between ICEs and bacterial viruses.
 We are focusing on mechanisms controlling horizontal gene transfer, interactions between mobile genetic elements
and their host cells, and the interplay between different mobile elements found in the same cell. Many of our studies are
initiated in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. It is easy to grow and manipulate, naturally contains a variety of mobile
elements, including one ICE (ICEBs1) and one functional (SPß) and two defective (PBSX, skin) temperate phages,
together comprising almost 6% of the genome. Our recent work indicates that there are beneficial phenotypes conferred
by ICEBs1 to host cells that extend well beyond those conferred by previously characterized ICEs, including effects on
the timing of sporulation and the activity of other resident elements.
 Despite the prevalence and importance of ICEs, there are major deficiencies in our understanding of these elements,
especially in Gram positive bacteria. Notably, little is known about the interactions between ICEs and their host cells
including with co-resident viruses, and the effects ICEs have on fitness of their bacterial hosts. Furthermore, little is
known about the interactions between functions encoded by ICEs and those encoded by hosts, and how these interactions
influence and determine the host range and efficiencies with which ICEs function in different species. Our work will
continue to focus on the lifecycle of ICEBs1 and Tn916, an ICE that is naturally found in several bacterial pathogens and
is involved in the spread of tetracycline resistance between them. The ability to experimentally induce ICEBs1 in ~25-
90% of cells in a population, to achieve relatively high conjugation frequencies, and to visualize events in single cells has
allowed us to answer previously difficult or unstudied problems fundamental to the ICE lifecycle. Our expertise in
chromosome dynamics, DNA replication, stress responses, and microbial development dovetails nicely with our studies of
ICEs and phages, notably how these processes affect the lifecycles of mobile genetic elements and how mobile genetic
elements affect these processes. We plan to pursue these interests, with particular focus on the connections between ICEs,
phages, and cellular processes. Our findings should be relevant to the biology of many bacterial species, especially
regarding the transfer of genes between bacteria growing in different environments, including the human microbiome."

Over two million people are afflicted with bacterial infections resistant to FDA-approved antibiotics in the United
States every year. Of those, more than 20,000 of these patients die as a result of these infections. The surge in
drug-resistant bacteria has become a growing pandemic and threatens to undermine medical gains made in the
last several decades. It has proven difficult to discover new antibiotics for a myriad of reasons, including under
developed concepts related to bacterial targets. To improve our ability to design and discover novel tools to
combat bacterial infections, it becomes important to better understand their biology. Bacterial cell walls are
unmatched targets for antibiotics, including being the target of many of clinically relevant agents. Yet,
foundational aspects of bacterial cell wall assembly and its interaction with the host organisms remain vastly
under explored. Our laboratory has extensive experience in designing cell wall analogs that become metabolic
processed by bacterial cells during cell wall growth and division. Within these substrate analogs, we introduce
non-native tags (e.g., click chemistry handles, biotin, fluorophores) that can be leveraged to elucidate the
processes underpinning cell wall biology.
For this proposal, we will apply these strategies towards two main areas: the development of probes related to
the processing of peptidoglycan, a primary component of bacterial cell wall and to the development of assays
that report on the accessibility of components on the cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria. Peptidoglycan is a
single large biomacromolecule composed of unique building blocks, including a short peptidic fragment called
stem peptide. Our laboratory has extensive experience in labeling cell wall of live bacteria to install unnatural
epitopes. The metabolic and site-selective labeling will be the basis for elucidating sites of peptidoglycan
modifications and will be the anchor point for the accessibility assay. Through these investigations, we project
that we will add insight into cell wall biosynthesis that can empower drug discovery and development."

Career Objectives: My long-term career goals are to conduct research that understands how digital health
tools can be used to improve care of older adults, to understand aging-specific barriers to these tools, and to
become an exceptional mentor for junior scientists. My short-term objectives during the award period, which
will help me to reach these goals, are as follows: (1) To gain further expertise in digital app development, with
a focus on measuring aging-related impairments; (2) To implement a junior faculty training program that
focuses on understanding risk for older patients in the medical and surgical subspecialties; (3) To become a
national leader in research at the intersection of geriatrics and digital health. To achieve my objectives I will
complete a structured program of career development that will strengthen my own research skills and my
ability to mentor others. I have assembled a team of faculty for my career training with expertise in geriatrics,
computer science, and geriatric cardiology. I will meet with these experts on a regular basis and in parallel will
pursue structured coursework and attendance at national scientific meetings. Mentoring Plan: I have
mentored over 20 trainees to date and will have 4 junior faculty mentees at the start of the award, all of whom
hold (or will soon be applying for) extramural funding. My mentees will complete a training program that
includes both formal didactics and regular 1:1 meetings with me in order to monitor progress. I will also identify
new trainees during the award period through several methods, including the NYU Cardiology Fellowship
Program (where I serve as core faculty), the NYU Department of Population Health, and national professional
societies where I have been involved in several geriatrics-focused committees. Research Plan: The proposed
research for this award aligns with my career development activities and will provide opportunities for mentees.
Our research plan focuses on use of the GeriKit app, a geriatric assessment tool that was developed through
NYU’s Geriatric Cardiology Program and is available for free on Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating
systems. We will first test GeriKit on a sample of 150 older adults (age ≥75) with ischemic heart disease to
evaluate whether the burden of measured impairments predicts readmission and mortality (primary composite
outcome) as well as health status (secondary outcome) (Aim 1). We will then convene a group of expert faculty
to add the domains of delirium, hearing impairment, and vision impairment to GeriKit, and will test functionality
on 20 older adults (Aim 2). Finally, we will work with NYU Medical Center Information Technology (MCIT) to
integrate GeriKit with the electronic health record (EHR) so that geriatric impairments become viewable in
patients’ medical histories. This step is critical in clinicians recognizing the presence of geriatric impairments,
which may influence clinical decision making. Summary: I have a strong commitment to mentoring, and this
award will enable me to become a truly exceptional mentor who trains the next generation of clinician-scientists
focused on improving the health of older adults."
10773127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypothalamic AgRP hunger neurons and POMC satiety neurons use neuropeptides AgRP, NPY, and αMSH to
regulate food intake, energy expenditure, and body weight. One important downstream target is the satiety-
promoting MC4R receptor-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHMC4R),
which receive converging peptidergic signals from AgRP and POMC neurons. However, exactly how PVHMC4R
neurons interpret and integrate these peptide signals remains unclear, especially regarding the involvement of
the downstream second messenger cAMP. The central unknowns can be summarized into three questions:
(i) How do hunger and satiety peptides alter cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons?
(ii) How does cAMP regulate the spiking of PVHMC4R neurons?
(iii) Where in a PVHMC4R neuron is cAMP signaling most influential in regulating PVHMC4R activity?
The main barrier to answering these questions is the lack of tools to measure and manipulate cAMP in PVHMC4R
neurons. I have recently overcome this barrier by helping develop and apply a molecular and optical toolset to
measure, make, and degrade cAMP during behaviors. The studies and career development activity in this
K99/R00 proposal are designed to provide me with the necessary training to initiate an independent research
program that applies the new cAMP tools to understand peptide signaling in PVHMC4R neurons. I hypothesize
that coordinated, opposing changes in AgRP and POMC neuron activity regulate spiking in PVHMC4R neurons
via competing actions on cAMP signaling. To test this hypothesis, I propose the following aims:
Aim 1: To image cAMP dynamics in PVHMC4R neurons with the optical sensor cADDis during experimentally
induced and feeding-induced peptide release, and to compare cAMP signaling between fasted and fed states.
Aim 2: To measure how directly increasing cAMP (using a new optogenetic tool, biPAC) and degrading cAMP
(using an engineered phosphodiesterase, PDE4D3-Cat) changes plasticity and spiking of PVHMC4R neurons.
Aim 3: To engineer and use subcellularly targeted cADDis, biPAC, PDE4D3-Cat in order to understand local
cAMP signaling in PVHMC4R neurons.
The proposed research will be mentored by Drs. Mark Andermann and Bradford Lowell, who will also provide
guidance on becoming an independent researcher. I will learn new techniques in intraventricular drug delivery,
whole-cell patch-clamp, and measurements of energy expenditure from my mentors as well as Drs. Alex Banks,
Maria Lehtinen, and Joseph Majzoub. I will receive training in protein engineering from Drs. Shiqiang Gao, Georg
Nagel, Bernardo Sabatini, and Gary Yellen. I will acquire new skills from the above experts and from courses
and scientific meetings, combined with my existing expertise in cAMP research. This will enable me to
understand when, where, and how cAMP is used to titrate PVHMC4R neurons activity. These results will fill an
important knowledge gap in developing and understanding treatments for obesity."

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, a better understanding of the factors that regulate broadly protective
immunity is needed. Interferon-lambda (IFN-λ) mediates antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 without
causing overt pathology and exacerbated disease. As such, recombinant IFN-λ is in clinical trials as a therapeutic
for COVID-19. However, the endogenous role for IFN-λ in regulating infection and functions in preventing disease
beyond antiviral programming during SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. Our preliminary data show that mice lacking
the IFN-λ receptor (Ifnlr1-/-) have increased illness and viral burden during SARS-CoV-2 infection without
alteration of canonical antiviral gene induction associated with IFN. Instead, IFN-λ positively regulates the
induction of CD8 T cell immunity, a cellular immune response critical to mediating protection against virus
infection when neutralizing antibody responses are avoided. We further identified upregulation of cell cycle repair
and proliferation genes associated with fibrosis in Ifnlr1-/- mice. This proposal will investigate these newly
identified non-canonical functions of IFN-λ in regulating immunity against SARS-CoV-2 with the goal of informing
therapeutic use of this cytokine."

Skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is a major complication in diabetic patients and Staphylococcus aureus is
the most common causative organism. Antibiotics frequently fail to clear these infections, leading to chronic
infection and progression to more severe infections such osteomyelitis and bacteremia. The reasons for the high
rates of treatment failure in diabetic patients remain unclear.
We employ a murine SSTI model with normal and diabetic mice and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA). We observe increased antibiotic tolerance and spontaneous antibiotic resistance (mutation) in diabetic
mice infected with MRSA, compared to the infected normal mice. We also observe a 10-fold increase in glucose
concentrations in the diabetic infection environment. We hypothesize that excess glucose in the diabetic infection
environment alters bacterial and host metabolism driving antibiotic tolerance and resistance.
In aim 1 we will examine how excess glucose primes glycolysis in S. aureus, leading to acidification of the
infection microenvironment and increased mutagenesis, resulting in antibiotic tolerance and resistance. In aim 2
we will examine how incapacitation of the immune system in diabetic mice may be inducing reservoirs of
antibiotic tolerant and resistant S. aureus during infection. In aim 3, we will examine the in-host evolution of
antibiotic tolerance, resistance, and fitness during sequential infection of diabetic mice to determine the
progression of mutations that result in highly virulent, antibiotic resistant strains that are likely highly deleterious
to the patient.
Determining how blood glucose levels contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance will be an important
development and will further emphasize the importance of treating and preventing diabetes, particularly as rates
continue to rise annually."

This career development award will provide the applicant (Alyssa Weakley, PhD) with the necessary training,
knowledge, and experience to transition to an independent research career. Dr. Weakley’s overall career goal is
to develop and validate accessible and innovative technology-based interventions that improve everyday
functioning in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), caregiving needs of
informal family caregivers, and the relationship/bond of the care dyad. Dr. Weakley will build toward this goal
with training and mentorship in (1) methods for identifying stakeholder (i.e., caregiver, care receiver) needs
regarding technology use, adoption, and adherence; (2) developing inclusive (in terms of race/ethnicity) and
accessible (in terms of technology familiarity) caregiver interventions; (3) randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
of behavioral interventions; and (4) multidisciplinary team leadership and technology-based data
management. Training aided by expert mentorship in these four areas will provide Dr. Weakley with the
knowledge and skills to complete three research aims, the focus of the proposed research project. These aims
include (1) identifying approaches to help cognitively impaired care receivers and distance caregivers engage
with technology via stakeholder focus groups; (2) iteratively adapt and refine, through stakeholder co-design
and participatory research methods, an intervention that facilitates use and integrates a remote caregiving
web-based tool (Interactive-Care (I-CARE)) into everyday life; and (3) implementing a pilot RCT examining the
feasibility and acceptability of the I-Care target intervention relative to basic I-Care training alone. The
proposed research is significant because it couples innovative remote caregiver technology with stakeholder
engagement to develop and test a novel intervention designed to improve outcomes for care receivers,
caregivers, and their dyadic relationship. No research, to the applicant’s knowledge, has utilized a co-design
approach for technology training that encapsulates remote caregiver and care receiver needs. Results will serve
as pilot data for an R01 study that further investigates the most robust, scalable, and accessible approaches to
improving functional outcomes in older adults with ADRD and caregivers. To complete her research and
training aims, Dr. Weakley will leverage existing resources with expertise at three centers at University of
California Davis: National Institute on Aging funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the Healthy Aging
in a Digital World initiative, and the Family Caregiving Institute. These resources, along with the mentoring
team’s strong commitment to Dr. Weakley’s research program, will provide Dr. Weakley with an enriched
environment that will undoubtedly help her achieve her career development goals."

Employees in the skilled trades industries (e.g., construction) are at high risk for injuries and fatalities because
the work is physical and machinery-related hazards are close at hand. Tradeswomen are at even higher risk
for adverse outcomes due to the complex and unique challenges they face, including discrimination and
harassment, poor personal protective equipment fit, and lack of access to safe bathroom facilities. The
objectives of this study fill three major knowledge gaps about women in skilled trade jobs: (1) identify the
unique workplace experiences (both problematic and beneficial) tradeswomen face; (2) quantify the impact
these factors have on tradeswomen; and (3) identify workplace strategies that can improve their safety, health,
and well-being. Our central hypothesis is that multiple factors affect tradeswomen’s Total Worker Health®
(TWH) and can be addressed by strategies based on a systems approach. The long-term goal of this work is
to improve tradeswomen’s safety, health, and well-being by identifying experiences specific to tradeswomen,
and using that knowledge to develop strategies for ensuring a better work life for women workers. Our
approach is based on the Sociotechnical Systems (STS) theoretical framework that will help us to identify key
risk and protective factors typically encountered by tradeswomen by incorporating interactions between people,
the environment, and technology. We will also include factors that influence the overall well-being of
tradeswomen from a TWH perspective. We will identify these key factors and develop organization- and
individual-level strategies for minimizing or promoting them, respectively, in order to support increased safety,
equity, and inclusion in the skilled trades. This project will produce (1) a survey tool that companies can use
to identify key factors that affect tradeswomen’s safety, health, and well-being; (2) a set of strategies, solutions,
and guidelines designed to mitigate key stressors for both tradeswomen (on navigating their unique
environment) and supervisors/organizations (on organizational supports for tradeswomen); and (3) new
materials (e.g., pamphlets, short videos, one-pagers) for research translation and dissemination of this
information/knowledge. We will employ a mixed methods approach by combining qualitative (interviews and
focus groups) and quantitative (survey) data to identify the key factors affecting the safety, health, and well-
being of tradeswomen, and generate strategies for solutions. Project aims are threefold: 1) Identify the
unique safety and health experiences tradeswomen face and quantify the identified factors that influence
tradeswomen’s safety, health, and well-being; 2) Assess the feasibility, benefits, barriers, and facilitators of
various individual- and organization-level strategies that can be applied to improve safety, health, and well-
being for tradeswomen; and 3) Disseminate the knowledge and findings generated in the study (Aims 1 and 2)
to stakeholders and the public."
10571351,"Summary: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. KRAS
is the most frequently mutated oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma, the most common subtype of NSCLC.
Approximately 30% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma harbor KRAS mutations, with G12C and G12V being
the most frequent forms. Direct targeting KRAS was historically difficult until the recent development of KRAS
G12C specific inhibitors, including AMG510 and MRTX849. These inhibitors have shown strong anti-tumor
effects in KRAS G12C-mutated lung adenocarcinoma patients, exemplified by the recent FDA approval of
AMG510 (Sotorasib). Despite this breakthrough in KRAS therapeutics, Sotorasib demonstrates a 32% response
rate in patients with lung cancer and patients often develop rapid resistance. Furthermore, there are no specific
inhibitors for KRAS G12V, the second most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop new strategies to improve the clinical response to KRAS G12C inhibitors, as well as to tackle
KRAS G12V lung adenocarcinoma. PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs)-mediated protein degradation
has emerged as a powerful system to specifically target oncogenic drivers. Utilizing this PROTACs system, we
have developed a versatile approach known as the degradation tag (dTAG) system, to rapidly deplete any tagged
target protein in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary study demonstrated that dTAG potently degrades oncogenic
KRAS variants and abolishes lung tumors in vivo, and drives anti-tumor immunity through increasing CD8+ T
and dendritic cell activity. My proposed project will leverage the dTAG system and novel KRAS G12C and G12V
preclinical models (organoids and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)) to further evaluate KRAS
degradation as a new therapeutic approach. Furthermore, with the KRAS G12C inhibitors and immunotherapy
clinical trials underway, evaluating the in vivo therapeutics of combining KRAS degradation with immunotherapy
is of high significance. Overall, Aim 1 is to comprehensively evaluate efficacy of targeted degradation of
oncogenic KRAS variants alone and in combination with immunotherapy in vivo. Aim 2 will dissect tumor
microenvironment alterations upon degradation of oncogenic KRAS mutants alone and in combination with
immunotherapy. Aim 3 will characterize the underlying cancer intrinsic and immunological mechanisms that
contribute to antitumor immunity. Findings from my research will offer evidence for further evaluation of the
protein degradation in targeting KRAS mutant cancers in clinical trials.To achieve these aims, I designed a 3-
year plan that includes participation in scientific and career development meetings, workshops and coursework
to further develop my cancer immunology and computational biology expertise. This career transition award will
greatly facilitate my goal of leading a multidisciplinary research laboratory focused on addressing challenges in
the treatment of lung cancer in the academic environment of an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center."

The CDC SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study found that Type I Diabetes (T1D) incidence increased by 1.8%
each year between 2002-2012, and Type II Diabetes (T2D) increased by 4.8%. The Environmental
Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study has attributed a substantial burden of T1D and T2D to
environmental contaminants. Due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes and metabolic diseases (especially
among youth), computational models for developmental pancreatic toxicity are needed. Understanding how
multiple factors such as chemical structure, gene expression and target tissue cytotoxicity integrate and impact
pancreatic health is vital. However, an integrated analysis of multiple factors at multiple scales poses great
challenges due to the inherent complexity, high-dimensionality, uncertainty, and heterogeneity. Multilayer
networks have emerged as a novel methodology in network science that combines multiple networks, called
“layers”, into one mathematical object. Multilayer networks are able to represent multiple factors across multi-
scales for a rigorous computational analysis of their interactions. Thereby, uncovering novel relations between
key factors on a multi-scale. The overarching goal of this research is to create multilayer network models by
which we can predict the magnitude and mechanisms of pancreatic developmental toxicity based on chemical
structure in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Aim 1 will build a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship
(QSAR) model to predict mechanisms of toxicity resulting from pharmacological and toxicological exposures in
the developing pancreas. The goal of Aim 1 is to utilize a multilayer network and topological clustering model to
predict the relationship between exposures and pancreatic developmental toxicity based on chemical structure.
Aim 2 will utilize multi-scale modeling to create an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) using molecular,
structural, and pathological criteria for pancreatic developmental toxicity. The goal of Aim 2 is to characterize
the processes by which exposures may disrupt pancreas development and early diabetic pathogenesis. We
will develop a rigorous predictive model that can be used to better inform a priori testing and expected
outcomes of small molecules in the context of pancreatic developmental diseases, and we will construct a
framework to connect peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) modulation (pharmacological &
toxicological) with aberrant pancreatic development and early function."
10739313,"Accumulating evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces tissue pathology in multiple organs in
addition to the lung, including, among others, intestine, heart, liver, kidney, and brain. Furthermore, SARS-
CoV-2 infection can exacerbate many chronic inflammatory diseases. However, mouse models that allow
to study SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology in specific organs are currently lacking. Additionally, therapeutic
strategies using the commercially available K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model are limited due to ectopic
hACE2 expression in the brain driving high lethality. To overcome these problems, we have generated mice
with conditional tissue-specific hACE2 expression. The goal of this proposal is to characterize these novel
mouse models and define the impact of SARS-CoV-2 specifically on lung immunopathology and intestinal
disease. Our central hypothesis is that mice with conditional expression of hACE2 in Rosa26 locus
represent a robust platform to study tissue-specific SARS-CoV-2-induced pathology. In Aim 1, we will test
the hypothesis that hACE2 expression in type II alveolar epithelial cells and club cells is necessary and
sufficient for SARS-CoV-2-induced lung immunopathology. We will analyze SARS-CoV-2 infection
dynamics and lung immunopathology in mice with specific expression of hACE2 in type II alveolar epithelial
cells and club cells, using our recently developed dual reporter- expressing mCherry-Nluc recombinant
(r)SARS-CoV-2. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates intestinal
inflammation using mice with specific expression of hACE2 in intestinal epithelial cells. This proposal is
innovative and significant, as it will generate and characterize novel small animal models to study SARS-
CoV-2 mediated organ-specific disease and provide insights into mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated lung
and gut pathology. These mouse models will provide a robust platform to study and monitor SARS-CoV-2
infection in desired cell types and long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to perform
therapeutic interventions."
10835867,"Type 2 immune responses are classically associated with parasite infections at barrier surfaces, and
evolved in part to repair the massive tissue damage that these maladies induce. However, the role of Type 2

that are primed to engage such responses upon tissue insult. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. PD-(L)1 immunotherapy has revolutionized care for NSCLC
patients, but its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) which is
predominantly populated by various myeloid cell subsets. Using single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we
recently mapped the immune landscape of the human and murine NSCLC TME. We identified several newfound
populations of myeloid cells that exhibited high transcriptional concordance across species. In both instances,
we found that myeloid cells within the TME specifically upregulated a transcriptional program driven by IL-4, a
prototypical Type 2 cytokine. Blockade of IL-4 strongly protected mice against orthotopic lung tumors.
Surprisingly, we found that IL-4-producing Th2 cells were essentially absent from the lung TME in mice and
humans. Instead, IL-4 was almost exclusively produced by basophils. Accordingly, antibody-mediated depletion
of basophils in vivo strongly reduced lung tumor development. Using mice with cell type-specific deletion of the
IL-4R we found that granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP)-derived cells were the dominant immune cells
responding to IL-4 to enhance tumor burden. Within the tumor, the overwhelming majority of these cells are
macrophages and neutrophils. Surprisingly, we also discovered that myeloid progenitors in BM directly sense
IL-4/IL-13 signaling during lung tumor development. Furthermore, GMP-specific deletion of IL-4R enhanced
myeloid cell differentiation in response to lung tumors, preventing the so-called “emergency myelopoiesis” known
to fuel tumor growth.
 Our central hypothesis is that basophil-derived IL-4 promotes NSCLC by controlling the development and
function of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. To address this, we first will identify signals from neoplastic cells
that activate basophils to produce IL-4 (Aim 1). Then, we will define how myeloid-intrinsic IL-4R signaling
controls the immune response to NSCLC, both at the level of the TME and at the level of myeloid differentiation
in BM, and how these two arms synergize during PD-1 immunotherapy (Aim 2). Finally, we will integrate our
findings from murine systems into the first human clinical trial of dupilumab, an FDA-approved IL-4R blocking
antibody, in metastatic NSCLC patients who have not responded to immunotherapy and evaluate relevant
immunologic alterations. Collectively, our work will (i) define a novel axis controlling lung tumor development, (ii)
identify targets for therapeutic intervention, and (iii) reinforce a growing paradigm in which tumor signals instruct
the fates of developing myeloid cells to affect cancer outcome."

Cell signaling and membrane traffic emerge from an ensemble of dynamic, transient protein-protein interactions
(PPIs) in a crowded milieu. Traditional structural and biochemical approaches are mostly limited to dissecting
the function of stable, structured PPIs. To address emergent function stemming from transient PPIs, my research
program develops innovative protein engineering and biophysical technologies. We investigate outstanding
questions in GPCR-G protein selectivity and cell surface receptor activation of myosins. Studies will advance the
fundamental cell biology of GPCRs and myosins, while delivering new therapeutic strategies to combat disease.
Building on new technologies and conceptual advances from my lab, we propose five parallel research projects.
(1) We discovered and characterized the temporal coupling of sequential GPCR-G protein interactions, leading
to allokairic modulation of GPCR signaling. We will dissect the structural basis of allokairic modulation through
the GPCR’s sequence-divergent third intracellular loop (ICL3). Using novel biosensors and receptor chimeras,
we will define roles for ICL3 in autoregulation and G protein selection in closely related receptor isoforms.
(2) We engineered a simple, accessible cell-free biosensor assay to measure the molecular efficacy of GPCR
ligands. We will use this assay to identify and characterize receptor isoform-selective biologics, including
peptides, peptide-mimetics, and nanobodies/affibodies. These biologics will serve as probes to advance the
structural basis of GPCR-G protein selectivity and yield cell-permeable strategies to selectively target GPCRs.
(3) We successfully integrated a computation-experiment collaboration to reveal the dynamic reshaping of GPCR
cytosolic cavities underlying G protein selection. Using this strategy, we will map temporally persistent receptor-
G protein interaction hot-spots across GPCRs, that encode G protein selectivity. We will dissect the structural
basis of allosteric modulators through the dispersal of inter-residue communication networks within GPCRs.
(4) We identified motor-cargo interaction kinetics and mechanical stiffness as two novel cellular regulatory
mechanisms of cytoskeletal motors. We will use programmable biomimetic scaffolds to dissect myosin regulation
through both receptor-adaptor and adaptor-motor ensembles. We focus on the impact of motor conformation
and clustering triggered by diverse cell surface receptors including β1-integrin, plexin D1, and LRP2/megalin.
(5) We will investigate a novel temporal bias mechanism in GPCR signaling, through receptor-mediated
engagement of myosins during membrane traffic. We will characterize the differential regulation of motor activity
through PDZ-binding motifs in the GPCR C-tail. We will use optogenetic/chemogenetic strategies to steer GPCR
trafficking and map the temporal signaling profile through second messenger and Akt/MAPK pathways."

Substantial changes in Medicare payment policies are occurring for post-acute care (PAC), which provides a
bridge from the hospital to home for individuals who require medical and rehabilitation (i.e., physical,
occupational, and speech therapy) services to transition successfully back to the community. Skilled nursing
facilities (SNFs) and home health agencies (HHAs) account for almost 80% of PAC spending. Rapid growth in
PAC spending has been driven largely by prior payment systems that incentivized therapy services. However,
new payment models were implemented in October 2019 for SNFs and January 2020 for HHAs that attempt to
address (a) the growth in spending and (b) the potential for misuse of therapy services. These new models
remove incentives for therapy but do not include controls for quality (e.g., community discharge, readmissions).
In response, PAC stakeholders have raised concerns that payment reform may differentially impact access to
and quality of care for vulnerable populations (e.g., racial and ethnic minorities, dually-eligible, rural-residing)
and diagnostic subgroups (e.g., dementia/Alzheimer’s, hip fracture) due to changing reimbursements. While
the new models are intended to promote appropriate and efficient care, the actual impact of payment reform is
unknown. We hypothesize that SNFs and HHAs will not respond uniformly to changing reimbursements and
that the new payment models will adversely impact quality of care for some, but not all, patient populations.
Therefore, our overarching goal is to evaluate the impact of payment reform overall and among vulnerable
populations and diagnostic subgroups. Using a natural experiment design that capitalizes on the timing of
payment reform and a mixed methods approach that uses rich qualitative data collected from SNF and HHA
staff and patients, as well as extensive patient-level Medicare claims and assessment data, we will:
 Aim 1: Identify SNF and HHA organizational responses to payment reform by quantifying changes in therapy
staffing and payer mix pre-post payment reform and qualitatively exploring stakeholder perspectives on
organizational processes, barriers, and facilitators to providing high-quality care under the new models.
Aim 2: Characterize access to SNF and HHA after hospital discharge and utilization of therapy within
SNF/HHA pre-post-payment reform overall and for vulnerable populations and diagnostic subgroups.
Aim 3: Quantify the association between therapy utilization and quality outcomes (e.g., functional change)
 pre-post payment reform overall and for vulnerable populations and diagnostic subgroups.
Rigorous qualitative and quantitative methodologies will allow us to (a) evaluate whether payment reform has
the intended result of incentivizing efficient care and (b) identify any unintended consequences related to
disparities in access to care and compromised quality. Findings will address stakeholders’ concerns and
provide critical information to policymakers, providers, system leaders, and payers on the impact of payment
reform on patient access and quality across patient populations, including the most vulnerable."

 Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging
technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and
producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current
pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology
features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells
are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular
components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures.
Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and
disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify
different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial
organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease
status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze
histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built
a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling,
and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from
histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions,
and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods
were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver
diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the
analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment,
diagnosis, and outcome prediction."
10754226,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Wilms tumor is the most common kidney cancer in children. High-risk patient groups continue to have dismal
outcomes. The greatest predictor of a poor outcome is microscopic detection of diffuse anaplasia (unfavorable
histology). This finding accounts for 50% of deaths from this disease and is associated with treatment resistance.
Diffuse anaplasia (unfavorable histology) is caused by mutation in the TP53 gene that occurs late in a tumor with
previously favorable histology. While TP53 mutation is associated with treatment resistance and poor outcomes,
it could also result in new tumor vulnerabilities. The long-term goal of our research is to identify and exploit new
therapeutic vulnerabilities in anaplastic Wilms tumor using targeted approaches. Wilms tumors with WT1
mutation do not go on to develop TP53 mutation and do not develop anaplasia. Previous evidence shows that
the gene WT1 serves as a tumor suppressor in Wilms tumor. However, our central hypothesis is that WT1
functions as an oncogene in anaplastic Wilms tumor. Tumors with WT1 mutation do not develop anaplasia
and WT1 and TP53 mutations do not occur in the same pediatric cancer patient tumors of any histology.
Therefore, we hypothesize that WT1 mutations and TP53 mutations in the same Wilms tumor cell could be lethal
events to the cancer cell. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that loss of function WT1 and TP53 mutations are
synthetic lethal events in Wilms tumor cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we will model knockout of WT1 in
TP53-mutant anaplastic Wilms tumor cells in vitro. We will also introduce a TP53 mutation into a mouse Wilms
tumor model that has loss of WT1 function. Our preliminary data show that WT1 is necessary for activation of
the telomerase pathway in Wilms tumor. Telomerase (critical portion coded by TERT gene) adds DNA repeats
to the ends of chromosomes to counteract chromosomal shortening caused by rapidly dividing cancer cells. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that functional WT1 is necessary for increased TERT expression and telomerase activity
in anaplastic Wilms tumor. By knocking out WT1 in vitro and in a mouse model system, we aim to determine if
WT1 is necessary for gain of telomerase function. We also will test the telomere targeted therapy 6-Thio-dG in
mouse xenograft models using human patient tumor samples. We have identified that the histone demethylase
KDM6B (an enzyme that modifies how DNA is bound to histones) regulates WT1 levels in Wilms tumor cells.
We have shown that inhibition of KDM6B lowers WT1 levels. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that KDM6B
upregulates WT1 in Wilms tumor and can therefore be exploited as a therapeutic target. We plan to perform in
vitro experiments which impair KDM6B function on the chemical and genetic levels in order to determine its
effect on WT1 and anaplastic Wilms tumor cell behavior. We also aim to test the KDM6B inhibitor GSK-J4 in
mouse xenograft models using human patient tumor samples. The expected outcome of these studies will be a
greatly improved understanding of how WT1 functions in anaplastic Wilms tumor and the evaluation of WT1,
telomerase, and KDM6B as preclinical therapeutic targets in anaplastic Wilms tumor."

Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are the most common forms of dementia. No
treatments exist to stop or prevent them. AD/ADRD are caused in part by the aggregation of one, or more often
a combination of, specific proteins. TDP-43 is one of a handful of such proteins. It characteristically transitions
from a dynamic liquid phase of assembly to a rigid and pathogenic phase in a large fraction of dementia cases.
This transition occurs against a backdrop of progressive changes in the interactions between different cell
types in the brain. An interdependence of these molecular and cellular changes likely determines the clinical
courses of AD/ADRD, but to understand that interdependence, we need new tools with which to compare
protein phase transitions and their corresponding phenotype effects in the context of interacting brain cell
types. We propose here to develop such a tool by modifying a cell-based biophysical method, Distributed
Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET) for use in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived brain tissue
models (Aim 1). We will simultaneously use DAmFRET to develop TDP-43 as a reporter of cell type-specific
differences in the homeostasis of protein phase transitions (Aim 2). By completing these aims, we will have
created and validated a uniquely powerful tool for better understanding the complex molecular and cellular
causes of AD/ADRD."

 Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are rising causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is
excitement that computational medicine, an emerging field combining engineering disciplines with the life
sciences, will enable scientific and clinical breakthroughs and accelerate bench-to-bedside translation.
However, few training programs exist in this field, and so trainees often learn ad hoc.
 We seek funding for a new multidisciplinary T32 program in Computational medicine in the Heart:
Integrated training Program (CHIP) at Stanford. CHIP will provide cutting-edge training for 3 post-PhD, -MD or
-MD/PhD fellows annually, each undergoing 2 years of training at the intersection of engineering, CV
physiology and medicine. Trainees will pursue a cutting-edge research project mentored by faculty with
complementary expertise in engineering and the life sciences, and select didactic courses to build expertise,
grow professionally, and develop community. The forward-looking vision of CHIP addresses key priorities of
several National Agencies and fills current gaps in interdisciplinary training.
 Stanford CHIP leverages faculty and resources at top-ranked Schools of Engineering, Medicine and
Humanities and Sciences. The T32 is co-directed by a physician-engineer and an engineer-physiologist,
bringing 38 faculty from 13 Departments and Divisions with strong emphasis on women and under -
represented minorities. Key support is provided by the inter-disciplinary Cardiovascular Institute (CVI) and the
Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford. Faculty will provide trainees with
research opportunities in CV science spanning cell-to-organ and bench-to-bedside, as well as computational
science, clinical care, and therapeutic innovation. The faculty are highly collaborative and have exceptional
track records of launching trainees into independent scientific careers.
 Applicant selection and all aspects of the program stress inclusion of trainees from under-represented
groups. Trainees will not be required to have backgrounds in both engineering and life sciences. The T32 will
provide tailored teaching of CV science to engineers, engineering to life-science fellows, and advanced cross-
disciplinary topics to each. Core didactics also include ethics, the responsible conduct of science, methods to
ensure reproducibility. Diversity, equity and inclusion are central for trainees and faculty. Evaluation will be
both constructive and bidirectional between trainees and faculty.
 In summary, the CHIP T32 at Stanford provides post-MD, post-PhD and post-MD/PhD graduates with
world-class training at the intersection of bioengineering, CV science and medicine. The T32 is well positioned
for success due to the co-location of these top-tier resources on a single campus in Silicon Valley, a hub of
innovation in data science, artificial intelligence and therapy. Our aspirational goal is that CHIP graduates
will become global scientific leaders at the cusp of engineering, physiology and medicine."
10793479,"The motivating force driving me to build an independent research enterprise has been my personal desire to
maximize functional recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Experiences in my life have solidified this
research goal as one of primary purpose, and my career trajectory and accomplishments through adversity
stand as evidence of my devotion to that purpose and ability to acheive it. This mission brought me to the
Philadelphia CMC VA Medical Center (CMC-VAMC), where I have found that my own research goals align
perfectly with those of the Rehabilitation R&D (RR&D) Service and the needs of our Veterans. To make the
greatest impact on TBI rehabilitation, I will utilize a unique large animal model to accurately replicate the
mechanisms and manifestations of human TBI: the swine rotational acceleration system applied to great effect
by my mentor, D. Kacy Cullen, PhD, and other researchers in his Center for Neurotrauma, Neurodegeneration,
and Restoration at the CMC-VAMC and University of Pennsylvania. In addition to diffuse axonal injury, this
model results in damage to the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) as observed in moderate TBI in
humans, leading to temporary loss of consciousness and lasting effects on sleep, fatigue, and cognition that are
major factors during recovery from TBI. Due to their small brain size, our commonly used rodent models
cannot be used to reproduce these aspects of the human injury or their manifestations, as the damage is a
product of rotational acceleration and brain mass. In this project I propose to build on the swine model,
extending beyond the acute injury period following moderate TBI to establish the first translational model of
moderate TBI Rehabilitation and Recovery at long-term time points most relevant for our Veteran population.
Such a high-fidelity preclinical model will provide the rigor and control necessary to directly test the efficacy of
individual ingredients of rehabilitation therapies (e.g. diet, exercise) and conduct detailed mechanistic
investigations to inform adjustments to existing therapies and development of new therapies that improve
efficacy. I will christen this vessel of bidirectional translation with a blinded, randomized investigation of the
efficacy and mechanisms of action of dietary branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) therapy for enhancing
cognitive recovery over a three-month study period (including investigation of Veteran-relevant delayed therapy
administration). Our studies will benefit greatly from clinically-relevant advanced neuroimaging, a gamut of
clinically-inspired neurobehavioral and neurological testing, extensive histopathological and
immunohistochemical analyses, and high-resolution post-mortem diffusion tensor imaging with anisotropy,
diffusivity, and tractography to quantify changes in brain connectivity that are a hallmark of human TBI. I will
also utilize this model to test the mechanisms and efficacy of regular exercise rehabilitation or exercise plus
BCAAs for improving recovery trajectory over a six-month period (also with Veteran-relevant delayed
treatment). Previous studies suggest that exercise and BCAA therapies share common mechanisms of action
and effects, and therefore I will effectively be testing the overarching hypothesis that enhancing neurotrophic
signaling and improving sleep quality after injury can improve cognitive recovery and reduce ARAS pathology
following moderate TBI. Beyond the advancements that this project will provide for our mission to maximize
functional recovery from brain injury in our Veterans, I will be gathering invaluable knowledge and expertise
from a dedicated, world-class mentorship team and carving a niche for my future career as an independent VA
investigator. Due to the swine model and the community of researchers gathered around it, the CMC-VAMC
and University of Pennsylvania are at the epicenter of translational TBI research. The greatest environment in
the world to achieve my research goals in TBI rehabilitation is within this community, and I intend to become an
integral member throughout my career. I will achieve independence through this Career Development Award
and provide considerable return on investment through a highly productive VA research career."

 Hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain clinically challenging and
refractory to traditional chemotherapy approaches. For many patients, hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the
only curative treatment, whereby part of the efficacy is driven by donor natural killer (NK) cells that target the
recipient’s leukemic cells. Natural killer cell adoptive therapy for AML patients represent a promising approach
for improving patient outcomes. Work done in the Fehniger lab has defined a strategy to induce a memory-like
(ML) phenotype of isolated NK cells using a stimulation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 that demonstrates enhanced
proliferation, cytotoxicity, and persistence both in vitro and in vivo. A phase 1 study using ML NK cells in
relapsed/refractory AML patients showed approximately 50% of patients achieving a complete remission,
although the mechanisms driving treatment failure are not clearly understood.
 Multidimensional immune correlative analysis of donor NK cells identified a negative association between
CD8 expression on NK cells and treatment response. However, the role of CD8 on human conventional and ML
NK cells remains unknown.
 The proposed project aims to understand the mechanism by which CD8 expression impacts conventional
and ML NK cell biology, and has broad implications for understanding NK cell responses in cancer, infection,
and autoimmunity. Preliminary data demonstrate that CD8+ NK cells have a diminished proliferative capacity
compared to CD8- NK cells both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that CD8 expression on donor NK cells
negatively impacts overall NK cell responses against AML. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on determining the
mechanisms by which CD8+ conventional and ML NK cells have compromised proliferation, and the subsequent
impact on tumor control in vivo. Specifically, the contributions of telomere length, chromatin accessibility, and
metabolic differences will be investigated. Aim 2 focuses on defining the function of the CD8 molecule itself
through highly efficient CRISPR-Cas9 based knockdown, and the subsequent impact on conventional and ML
NK cell cytotoxicity, signaling, and survival. Together, these results will further inform future NK cell therapy
designs and enhance our understanding of CD8 and its contributions to fundamental aspects of NK cell biology."

 PROJECT SUMMARY
 What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable
treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this
versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and
interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation
could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable
therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game
changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the
support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular,
adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By
controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in
acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological
roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and
functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular
behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and
compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells
to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an
unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined
structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its
immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this
notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in
human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other
preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified
network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic
modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through
NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by
thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of
NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the
proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology,
immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is
to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use."

10788394,"1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available
 2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a
 3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause
 4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small
 5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called
 6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before
 7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the
 8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which
9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and
10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown
11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in
12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are
13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer
14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed
15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin.
16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of
17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the
18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily
19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to
20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely
21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual
22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage
23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used
24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies
25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin
26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the
27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment
28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions.
29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers
30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology."

 Bacterial natural products have a long history of serving as lead structures for the development of new
therapeutically relevant small molecules. Despite the tremendous early success of bacterial natural product
discovery programs, both academic and industrial drug screening efforts have largely deprioritized natural
products in recent years due to unacceptably high rediscovery rates, which were often taken as an indication
that nature had few novel small molecules left for us to identify. Extensive sequencing of both bacterial
genomic and metagenomic DNA indicates that this is, in fact, not the case. Instead, it appears that we have
just begun to scratch the surface of the structural and functional diversity of small molecules encoded by the
global microbiome. In most environments uncultured bacteria still significantly outnumber their cultured
counterparts, and even when it is possible to grow bacteria in the laboratory they usually only express a small
subset of their natural product biosynthetic gene clusters. My research group is focused on the development of
culture-independent (metagenomic) approaches for identifying novel natural products encoded provides a
means of accessing this large fraction of previously inaccessible biosynthetic diversity. In these studies, the
need to culture bacteria is circumvented by extracting DNA directly from environmental samples and cloning it
into easily cultured bacteria. This proposal is designed to continue our development of culture-independent
methods for accessing the natural products encoded in soil metagenomes and to increasingly apply these
methods to the discovery and characterization of new bioactive small molecules. In particular, our studies will
include the development of new sequence-based and functional metagenomic screening methods as well as
the use of heterologous expression and synthetic bioinformatic natural product discovery approaches to
generate novel small molecules from soil metagenome derived biosynthetic gene clusters. Method develop
studies will be focus on overcoming key technical hurdles to enable the more efficient and higher throughput
discovery of structurally and mechanistically different natural products from metagenomes using both
bioinformatic and unbiased functional screening approaches. As with traditional natural product discovery
programs, our ultimate goal is to identify bioactive small molecules that have the potential to be used as lead
structures for the development of novel therapeutics. Although our metagenomic methods can be applied to
the identification of compounds that can target almost any disease, we will primarily focus on the discovery of
new antibiotics. This choice is driven by the long history of natural products being the most productive source
of potent antibiotics with unique modes of actions and the clear biomedical need for new antibiotics that are
effective against clinically relevant, multi-drug resistant, Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens."

This is a renewal proposal requesting an additional five years of T35 funding to support a three-month summer
training program at the National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) for students enrolled in a
Doctor of Audiology (Au.D.) clinical degree program. We request funding to cover four students annually for the
duration of the grant. M. Patrick Feeney, Ph.D. will be the Program Director. He will be assisted by an Advisory
Committee. The long-term objective of our program is to increase the number of individuals with a clinical Au.D.
who go on to pursue a Ph.D. and a career in research audiology. The NCRAR is a VA-funded research center
consisting of 14 Ph.D. investigators, all of whom will serve as T-35 faculty. NCRAR research focuses on
diagnosis, rehabilitation and prevention of auditory and balance disorders through translational and applied
human studies, many of which use clinical methodologies to obtain data. It thus has particular appeal and
application to the clinical Au.D. students for whom the program is designed.
During the summer, each student works with their mentor to design and conduct a research project, while also
working in their mentor's laboratory, attending courses held by NCRAR faculty and guests, participating in
NCRAR journal groups, meetings and seminars, holding discussions with each NCRAR Investigator, attending
a summer audiology conference and visiting other local research facilities. Finally, students are required to
present their mentored research project to members of the NCRAR, and at the American Auditory Society annual
meeting. They are also encouraged to work with their mentor to publish the findings of this project.
All students enrolled in an accredited Au.D. program are eligible to participate. The program is publicized via
mailings to Au.D. Department Chairs, on the NCRAR website, and at audiology conferences throughout the year.
To apply, students must send a statement of interest describing what they hope to gain from the traineeship, a
curriculum vitae, at least two letters of recommendation and an applicant evaluation form completed by their
Au.D. program advisor. Applications are evaluated by the NCRAR faculty using undergraduate GPA, letters of
recommendation, the content of their personal statement and the applicant evaluation form as metrics.
Since 2007 two past trainees have received a Ph.D. and are Assistant Professors, two trainees are currently
enrolled in Ph.D. programs, and five are research audiologists. Twelve trainees have had peer-reviewed

10767842,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a formidable and growing challenge to the VA healthcare system, represents a
heterogenous set of hyperglycemic disorders involving impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and
increased hepatic glucose production. Both insufficient insulin secretion from β cells and dysregulated, typically
increased, glucagon secretion from α cells, contribute to the hyperglycemia in T2D. While many hypotheses
and models exist, the molecular mechanisms responsible for human islet dysfunction in T2D are incompletely
defined and largely unknown or unproven. Most models and hypotheses about the T2D β cell arise from
studies of rodent models and have not been confirmed or tested in human samples. Because of the many
differences in human and rodent islets, it is critical to study potential regulators in a human islet context and
that will be a focus of this proposal. This proposed studies are based on evidence that islets from donors with
short-duration T2D have impaired insulin secretion, enhanced glucagon secretion, and reduced expression of
PAX6, an islet-enriched transcription factor recently shown in rodent systems critical to islet β cell identify and
functional maintenance. Very little is known about the role of PAX6 is human islet cells. The proposed studies
will test the hypothesis that PAX6 is required for normal human α and β cell function and that reduced PAX6
expression contributes to T2D islet α and β cell dysfunction in these aims: (1) Determine the functional and
transcriptional consequences of PAX6 transcriptional control normal human islets in vitro; (2) Determine the
functional consequences of PAX6 loss from normal human α or β cells in vivo; (3) Assess whether PAX6 loss
in short-duration T2D islets is reversed by treatment with a Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist. By
employing innovative experimental approaches such as creation of human pseudoislets in which gene
expression can be modified and transplantation of genetically modified human pseudoislets into
immunodeficient, glucagon-less mouse model (NSG-GKO) to allow for the assessment of α and β cell function
in vitro and in vivo, these studies will expand our understanding of the molecular processes regulating human
α and β cell function and islet dysfunction, leading to new clinically actionable information for T2D treatment."
10789860,"Project summary/abstract: National data on career choices of emerging scientists indicate that less than 25%
pursue a traditional independent pathway in an academic environment. This grim reality is even worse for
underrepresented minorities (URM), who represent 39% of college age individuals yet only 13% of PhDs in life
sciences. In 2015, we were awarded a NIGM R25 Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (Rush-IMSD).
Rush R25-IMSD was charged with training pre-doctoral URMs in biological sciences at Rush University in
Chicago, IL. Although Rush R25-IMSD was a budding program, we achieved an impressive track record in our
first 5 years of training and retaining of PhD URMs students, some of whom received F31s and/or research
supplement awards. This formal structure dedicated to URM PhD training, a first at Rush, was instrumental in
building alliances to promote URM education within and outside of our university. Specifically, Rush R25-IMSD
is a documented success aligned with institutional commitment for diversity and inclusion.
 With the recognition that minorities continue to be underrepresented in PhD life science programs, and
consequently the biomedical workforce does not reflect the diversity of our nation, we propose a new program
for training of URM PhD students at Rush University under a T32 mechanism (as NIGM is phasing out R25
IMSDs). The pillars of T32 IMSD-Rush is a triad of rigorous mentoring, education, and research training of pre-
doctoral URM students through harnessing the expertise of nationally recognized mentors and program faculty
across several departments. Three students per year will be selected to participate in T32 IMSD-Rush and
supported for the first three years of matriculation (an additional participant will be under institutional support).
Together, we expect a cohort of 20 students over five years. The overarching goal of T32 IMSD-Rush will be
attained through two interrelated specific aims:
 1) Train emerging URM scientists in technical and operational basis of discipline-based research:
T32 IMSD-Rush will be inter-and multidisciplinary program for training of URM PhD students in one of several
disciplines (immunology/microbiology, physiology and biophysics, cell and molecular medicine, neurologic
sciences, orthopedics/bioengineering). Participants will select a discipline and be matched with a primary mentor
who along with nationally recognized leaders will guide the research development of the participant from idea
conception to successful execution (e.g., the operational phase of training include knowledge acquisition,
rigorous experimental design and data interpretation). Participants will also be trained in highly innovative and
cutting-edge technology that can be used across disciplines to address impactful scientific questions and
discoveries through designated workshops in imaging (live cell imaging, CT scans, confocal microscopy), small
animal models (animal care, humanized mice, transgenic rats), molecular approaches (RNA/DNA scope,
quantitative gene knockdown), quantitative and computational approaches (high-input statistics, bioinformatics)
and training in scientific reproducibility and rigor. The participants will be captured early and integrated into the
program through pre-matriculation (summer) training modules. Milestones include submission and acquisition of
NIH individual predoctoral awards (F31) or individual predoctoral to postdoctoral fellow transition award
(F99/K00), publication of two peer-reviewed manuscripts, one of which as a first author, and successful
completion of the PhD program.
 2) Implement and optimize best practices for training of emerging URM science investigators:
Classical mentorship relies heavily on scientific research prowess. There is a greater recognition and
appreciation that mentorship should be a holistic strategy, combining training in rigor in research with
professional skills and network/alliance building to facilitate the development of a well-rounded emerging
scientist, one who will successfully face the challenges of academic research, in particular, and of science in
general. T32 IMSD-Rush will provide URM mentorship through direct and regular one-on-one contact and
organized activities through workshops to maximize each participant’s professional development. These
programs will include training modules on poster and oral presentations, emotional intelligence, conflict
resolution, verbal and non-verbal communication, negotiations, financial budgeting/fiscal responsibility of running
a team and/or lab, interviewing skills and most importantly building a culture of inclusion as a supportive network
for URMs. Best practices will be used to train the participants. Mentors/program faculty will undergo mentorship
training established by the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN).
 Collectively, these initiatives are the cornerstones to ensure that T32 IMSD-Rush participants will be fully
prepared to navigate the demands and challenges facing URM scientists.
 T32 IMSD-Rush will be evaluated through a well-integrated process to track, report, and assess long-
term outcomes of trainees. Our findings will be shared through open dissemination of information and networking
with organizations with similar interest. Our long-term goal is to increase enrollment of PhD URM students in
biomedical sciences at Rush by at least 50%, with 90% successfully completing the program, and ≥50% will
choose post-graduate training. Also, we envision that T32 IMSD-Rush instituted model for graduate student
training will evolve into a platform that has university and community sustainability and sustained partnerships."
10795935,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM), a high-grade glioma (grade IV), is the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor
in adults. There is no effective treatment of GBM. After standard treatment, the median survival of GBM
patients is around 15 months. GBM is featured by enhanced cell proliferation, high propensity of
invasion/diffuse infiltration throughout the brain, and resistance to chemo-/radiation therapy. Emerging
evidence supports that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, ~18,000 human lncRNA genes) can mediate tumor-
promoting/suppressing effects and serve as independent diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. Our previous
integrative genomic study revealed that many lncRNAs show dysregulated expression, are associated with
clinical prognosis, or harbor frequent somatic copy number alterations in GBM, suggesting an important role of
lncRNAs in GBM pathogenesis. However, the function and mechanism of most lncRNAs in GBM are unknown.
To fill this gap, our long-term goal is to leverage systematic multi-omic approaches to characterize the function
and mechanism of lncRNAs in GBM, and to help develop new therapeutic strategies based on novel insight
into lncRNA regulation in GBM. Our large-scale loss-of-function screen using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)
identified an antisense lncRNA, lnc-YINC (YBX1-interacting lncRNA) that was critical for GBM cell growth and
was significantly up-regulated in GBM compared with normal brain tissue and low-grade glioma (LGG). The
higher expression of lnc-YINC was associated with shorter overall survival of GBM patients. Functionally, lnc-
YINC acted in-trans and was a key regulator of cell cycle progression of GBM cells/glioma stem cells (GSCs)
and self-renewal of GSCs. It also protected GBM cells/GSCs from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused
by endogenous stress or exogenous ionizing radiation. Mechanistically, lnc-YINC interacted with YBX1, and
post-transcriptionally regulated the expression of key regulators of cell cycle or DSB repair, at least partially by
stabilizing their mRNAs. Based on these new findings, we hypothesize that lnc-YINC is a GBM-promoting
lncRNA that promotes proliferation of and modulates radio-sensitivity of GBM cells/GSCs, by enhancing YBX1
binding to key regulators of cell cycle/DSB repair and co-regulating their expression at post-transcriptional level.
The objectives of this proposal are (a) to determine the role of lnc-YINC in gliomagenesis, (b) to integrate
enhanced CLIP-seq (eCLIP-seq), ribosome profiling, RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry data, with
functional assays to identify the downstream targets of lnc-YINC/YBX1 that are key to regulating cell cycle or
DSB repair, (c) to dissect the molecular mechanisms whereby lnc-YINC/YBX1 axis post-transcriptionally
regulates the expression of key regulators of cell cycle or DSB repair, (d) to determine the role of lnc-YINC in
modulating radio-sensitivity of GBM cells/GSCs and to investigate the therapeutic impact of combining
inhibition of lnc-YINC with radiation therapy on GBM maintenance in vivo. This application is strengthened by a
team of experts of basic/clinical science of GBM, DNA damage repair, RNA biology and proteomics."

Defining Small Intestinal Microbial Landscapes To Improve Therapeutics For Gastrointestinal Disease
Disease Relevance: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disorder characterized by altered bowel
function (consistency and/or frequency) in additional to abdominal pain, effecting 7-16% of the US population
and associated with an $1 billion of direct health care costs annually. This proposal seeks to better understand
IBS and to develop more effective treatments for IBS. Candidate and Career Development Plan: My long-term
goal is to become a fully independent physician scientist through leadership of a cutting-edge research program
in human microbiota analysis and its association with clinical data complemented using a variety of tools
(molecular genetics, metabolomics, gnotobiotic mouse models) to clarify mechanisms of action that will enable
development of improved microbiota directed therapeutics for GI disease. Through my clinical training I am
poised to become an expert in diagnosing and treating IBS, and through my previous research training am well
equipped with the skills to perform high-resolution human and mouse immunology. To fully actualize my career
goals of becoming an expert in microbiota-host interactions in IBS I will need to gain skills beyond my current
knowledge base. This award will support the needed additional training in microbiota analysis, methods of clinical
research, bacterial isolation and culturing, and gnotobiotic mouse models. Research Plan: The overarching
research goal of this proposal is to move beyond feces, to define the site-specific microbial ecology of the human
small intestine in IBS. We will construct a longitudinal map of intestinal microbiota and metabolites in humans
with a swallowed, microbiota sampling capsule device. I have successfully employed this approach in healthy
humans and the proposed research will expand sample collection to include IBS patient samples analyzed with
microbiota sequencing, novel microbiota-focused metabolomics (Aim 1), and bacterial isolation and functional
testing (Aim 2), with complementary studies in gnotobiotic mice (Aim 3) to define fundamental aspects of host-
microbe interactions in the small intestine. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world
class mentorship team with expertise in translational human microbiome studies (Justin Sonnenburg, primary
mentor), isolation and study of bacteria from the human microbiome (KC Huang, co-mentor), and the treatment
and study of IBS (Linda Nguyen, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University
is a world leader in human microbiome studies and treating Gastroenterological(GI) disease. I will have access
to mentorship, collaborators, and a breadth of resources that will provide an exceptional training environment.
My mentorship team and the leadership within the Stanford Department of Medicine are committed to ensuring
my success. The scientific training, skill acquisition, and career development under this award will allow me to
become a fully independent physician scientist and leader in the translational microbiota science of GI disease."
10750986,"Abstract: Genome-wide synthetic lethal screening for vulnerabilities in a cell model of succinate
dehydrogenase-loss paraganglioma
This proposal focuses on the molecular pathology of familial paraganglioma (PGL). Paradoxically, this
remarkable neuroendocrine cancer is caused by inherited mutations that inactivate succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. A fundamental scientific
understanding of the molecular basis of this tumor is lacking, limiting powerful approaches that might be
identified to exploit unique vulnerabilities due to the fundamental metabolic defect in this cancer. The links
between SDH loss and tissue-specific tumorigenesis remain unknown, and conventional preclinical
models have been unavailable. The current hypothesis for PGL tumorigenesis invokes loss or inactivation of
both parental copies of any of the four SDH subunit genes (A-D). The subsequent accumulation of succinate
competitively inhibits the activities of several dioxygenase enzymes that normally suppress hypoxic signaling
and demethylate histones and DNA. Despite this general mechanistic model, other mechanisms are possible
and it is unclear what unique vulnerabilities may be present in SDH-loss cells that could permit targeted
therapies. We hypothesize that an unbiased genome-wide lentiviral CRISPR screen will identify genes
whose loss displays synthetic lethality with SDH loss. This hypothesis is supported by previous successful
work in our labs identifying genes whose loss confers resistance to multiple forms of endocrine therapy in
ERα+ and ERβ+ breast cancer cells. Important new PGL cell models have become available in the form of
Sdhblox/lox and Sdhb-/- immortalized mouse chromaffin cells (imCC). This positions us ideally to conduct and
analyze an unbiased genome-wide synthetic lethal screen using an available CRISPR single guide RNA
(sgRNA) library. Aim 1 will undertake a paired unbiased lentiviral CRISPR screen in matched normal and
SDH-loss imCC lines. Aim 2 will complete data analysis to identify candidate synthetic lethal genes. Aim 3 will
complete independent validation of representative synthetic lethal genes and pathways. Finally, Aim 4 will
implement a mouse allograft tumor model to monitor selective inhibitory effects of nominated target gene
knockdown in Sdhb-/- vs. Sdhblox/lox imCC. This project is unique in being the first unbiased synthetic
lethal screen addressing the unmet cancer needs of SDH-loss familial PGL patients. Because SDH
genes are tumor suppressors in other cancers, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and some
kidney cancers, identifying potential vulnerabilities in SDH-loss cells may be broadly applicable clinically."
10830989,"Over 3.3 million US women per month are at risk for Alcohol-Exposed Pregnancy (AEP). Prenatal alcohol
exposure can cause lifetime costly intellectual and physical disabilities in children. Risk for AEP is greater
among Native Americans, because rates of unintended pregnancy and binge/heavy drinking are inequitable
between Native women and the general population. AEP counseling interventions for Native women are
efficacious, but too costly to sustain. Digital interventions increase the reach of evidence-based behavioral
interventions while reducing cost. This project will tailor and optimize the first digital AEP intervention, CARRII,
piloted in a general population of women with AEP risk, for Native women. Guided by the Multiphase
Optimization Strategy (MOST), we will systematically test a Native-tailored version of CARRII with candidate
novel components to develop an optimized intervention for Native women at risk of AEP. The overarching goal
of this R61/R33 proposal is to determine the optimal combination of novel intervention strategies to include
with CARRII (tailored for Native women) that maximizes digital intervention efficacy at feasible cost for Native
communities. In R61 Aim 1, we will identify needs for a digital intervention for AEP risk reduction for Native
women, determine the best strategies for their engagement, evaluate and tailor CARRII intervention
components for Native women, and deploy CARRII and new intervention components on a platform that is
accessible on any device. In R61 Aim 2, we will tailor 5 new candidate intervention components that vary in
automation and hypothesized impact on AEP risk behavior, and determine their costs and short-term effect
sizes on alcohol and contraception. The 5 candidates are: repeated timeline follow-back AEP risk interviews,
monthly pregnancy testing, digital training on skills for safer sex and reduced drinking, automated text
messaging to prompt use of safer sex and reduced drinking skills, and access to an anonymized participant
community message board. We will test each component in 6-week pre-post trials with 50 Native women to
assess independent effects on drinking and contraception while considering practical aspects such as
frequency and duration of contact with participants and costs of each component. Achieving R61 milestones
will permit progression to the R33 phase. In R33 Aim 3, we will conduct a large 3-month factorial experiment
with 512 participants. This design will identify the optimal intervention that efficiently balances AEP risk
reduction with community-informed sustainable cost. We will conduct exploratory analyses of mediation/
moderation and identify study feasibility metrics (rates of Native women with AEP risk, and completing study
recruitment, baseline, intervention, and follow-up vs. dropout) for a subsequent RCT. This project will be the
first to systematically optimize a digital AEP intervention tailored for Native women at acceptable costs. The
project will prepare the team for the first nationwide RCT of an optimized, sustainable digital AEP intervention
tailored with and for Native women at risk of AEP to reduce AEPs in this high risk subpopulation."
10766231,"Project Summary
Metabolism is a tightly controlled and complex process in which different nutrients are taken up and processed
to meet variable needs. The regulation of uptake and processing requires that many nutrients and metabolites
are sensed. This poses a challenge since some of the molecules that are being sensed are simultaneously
subject to processing. This has led to the suspicion that metabolic pathways may directly sense the flux through
the pathway, instead of sensing only the concentration of nutrients or metabolites. Recent work has confirmed
this by identifying a flux-sensing system in bacteria, although the mechanism used is complex and may not
translate to other systems. In preliminary work on the galactose utilization (GAL) pathway of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, we have identified a novel putative mechanism for connecting enzymatic activity to signaling,
providing a simple way for metabolic flux to be measured. Because this mechanism is simple, we suspect that it
may occur in many pathways. We now propose to investigate this hypothetical mechanism in detail. The GAL
pathway is an ideal system in which to identify and mechanistically characterize flux sensing. It is a classic model
system for signaling in eukaryotes, and we have extensive methods and genetic tools available. Systematic high-
throughput quantitative measurements will be used to develop and refine computational models, which in turn
will be used to both guide and interpret experiments and to give insight into the physiological role of both flux
and concentration sensors. The insights we gain from the GAL pathway will then simplify the discovery of flux
sensors in other pathways. Next, we will bring the tools and models we develop to characterize GAL signaling
to bear on identifying and characterizing the sensor modalities in the pathway responsible for metabolizing
nitrogen in S. cerevisiae. Based on literature findings, we suspect that this pathway also contains a flux sensor.
We anticipate that identifying flux sensors in these pathways will immediately provide insight into the potential
for flux sensing in human metabolic pathways, and lead to the identification of promising new therapeutic targets."
10813704,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to be the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States by 2030. With a 5-year relative survival rate of just 10%, PDAC has the highest death
rate among the most common cancers, underscoring the urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that improve
clinical outcomes. Recent years have witnessed a growing appreciation of the role that metabolic reprogramming
plays in conferring survival advantages to PDAC cells, and the targeting of metabolic processes is considered a
promising area for the development of novel therapies. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells favor glycolysis
for energy production, a phenomenon called the Warburg effect. As a glycolytic byproduct, transformed cells
produce an excessive amount of H+ ions. This cytosolic accumulation of H+ would be detrimental to cell fitness;
therefore, tumor cells have evolved mechanisms to achieve pH homeostasis. Using PDAC as a model system,
we discovered that cytosolic pH in cancer cells is regulated by organellar sequestration of H+ ions via
compartmental ion transport and that the trans-Golgi network (TGN) can act as a “sink” for cytosolic H+.
Importantly, normal cells do not employ this homeostatic mechanism. Using the NHE7 Na+/H+ antiporter, which
is primarily localized to the TGN, we have shown that targeting NHE7 causes acidification of the cytosol and
subsequent cell death in PDAC cells but not normal cells. We have further validated these findings in mouse
models of PDAC. Patient-centric data analyses show that TGN localized transporters are frequently
overexpressed in PDAC and their elevated expression is correlated with worse overall survival. To robustly
quantify pH in the lumen of the TGN, we have developed an innovative TGN-targeted pH biosensor assay, which
has been optimized for high-throughput (HT) screening of small molecule compound libraries to identify novel
TGN-selective acidification inhibitors. We have validated our TGN pH biosensor HT assay in a set of clinical trial
and approved drugs, as well as kinase inhibitors. To complement our HT screen, we have designed a cutting-
edge secondary and tertiary assay pipeline to further validate TGN-selective compounds. We hypothesize that
novel Golgi–specific small molecule inhibitors of organelle acidification will selectively prevent cancer cells from
achieving proper pH homeostasis, resulting in acidic cytosolic pH and cell death. In this grant we will: 1) perform
a large-scale HT screen to identify inhibitors of TGN acidification and confirm the hits, 2) validate the confirmed
hits using secondary assays and prioritize hit scaffolds, and 3) map compound effects to TGN components and
select and characterize final probe(s). Successful completion of this work will provide novel small molecule
chemical probes validated to interfere with TGN acidification and cause cancer-selective cell death, serving as
starting points to be further developed into safe and effective therapeutic agents for PDAC."

10764274,"Project Summary/Abstract
The synthesis of proteins takes place by ribosomal translation of mRNA molecules. Despite its
central importance in biology, there are only a handful of techniques to analyze
ribosome::mRNA complexes in vivo, and none of these are able to identify sites of ribosome
binding on intact and individual mRNA molecules. A facile technique to simultaneously
sequence mRNA molecules and visualize sites of ribosome::mRNA interactions would greatly
expand the ability to study protein synthesis, with impacts from model organism biology through
human clinical applications. This application’s broad, long-term objective is to develop a
technology to simultaneously identify all sites of ribosome binding on a single mRNA molecule,
sequence the mRNA molecule, and do so across all mRNA molecules in a sample. To achieve
the objective, we will combine the relatively old technology of chemical footprinting to mark sites
of ribosome::mRNA interaction and the nascent technology of single molecule mRNA
sequencing on the Oxford nanopore device to identify modification sites. Specifically, we will: (1)
Identify appropriate chemical footprinting reagents and evaluate nanopore performance in
modification detection and sequence identification on RNAs treated with the reagents; (2)
Chemically footprint ribosome::mRNA complexes, and compare information obtained to the
existing state of the art (ribosome footprint profiling); (3) Develop computational algorithms to
identify footprints via statistical inference, using both simulated and real-world data. Results
from these aims will provide critical data on the feasibility of ribosome footprinting with whole
transcript single molecule sequencing. The resulting protocol will equip researchers and
clinicians to visualize and quantify facets of protein synthesis in their experimental system of
choice for diagnostic purposes, high-throughput phenotyping, and/or mechanistic analysis of
protein synthesis."
10876239,"Over the past decade, precision medicine research in head and neck cancer (HNC) has been singularly focused
on a single biomarker, human papillomavirus (HPV), to target low-risk patients for treatment de-intensification
(i.e., reduce therapy to improve quality of life without sacrificing survival). De-intensification is vital since standard
treatment involves toxic doses of chemoradiation that causes adverse events and debilitating long-term side
effects in most patients. In 2019, however, two phase-III clinical trials confirmed that HPV was insufficient to
target the most promising de-intensified therapy. This failure presents a timely opportunity to test new prognostic
markers to target de-intensified therapy in the 41 existing clinical trials, but a lack of promising biomarkers hinders
progress. HNC is a disease marked by extensive metabolic heterogeneity that is emerging as a rich source of
novel prognostic biomarkers but has yet to be fully investigated. For instance, many of the somatic mutations in
HNC that are associated with prognosis (e.g., TP53 and PIK3CA) are upstream regulators of key metabolic
processes in glycolysis, lipids, amino acids, and cell signaling. Recent studies have showed that the Warburg
effect, the atypical metabolic state in which a tumor upregulates glycolysis but bypasses mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), is a key discriminating characteristic between HNC cell lines linked to prognosis.
Most recently, five different studies in 2020 found that gene expression probes targeting metabolic regulating
genes created signatures that can predict HNC patient survival. The evidence leads to one conclusion—
metabolism is intimately involved in the development, progression, and survival of HNC. Thus, metabolomics
may be the best approach to discover the translational biomarkers vital to the future of HNC precision medicine.
However, the data required to investigate and validate an HNC metabolomic biomarker, particularly in a clinical
setting, is severely lacking. My program of research aims to fill that gap. In my KL2 research, which includes 209
HNC patients with blood plasma metabolomics, I used machine learning algorithms to identify a pretreatment
metabolomic endotype comprised of glycolysis, OXPHOS, lipid biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolites. The
endotypes categorized patients into one of two distinct groups that were associated with overall survival (hazard
ratio = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.19-4.78). Most importantly, the prognostic ability of the endotype was independent of
relevant clinical factors such as HPV, smoking, age, sex, race, tumor site and stage, suggesting that it may
succeed as an HNC biomarker where others have failed. The goal of this R03 is to validate my KL2 findings with
an independent cohort (Aim 1) and investigate how the metabolomic endotype in blood is related to metabolism
and metabolic characteristics in the tumor (Aim 2). Positive findings from this study will help me translate this
biomarker to ongoing clinical trials data within NRG Oncology, a multisite cancer clinical trials consortium, to test
whether the pretreatment metabolomic blood biomarker can identify HNC patients who will respond to de-
intensified therapy and spare them the toxic effects of standard chemoradiotherapy."

orthogonal multi-step protein purification approach. Specific Aim 1b seeks to examine the mechanisms involved
in trophoblast-mediated hepcidin suppression, including the role of ALK2 ubiquitination. Iron disorders of
pregnancy and their interaction with inflammation commonly contribute to adverse maternal and fetal outcomes.
My preliminary data suggest the role of the TNFα-TNFR1 pathway in this process. For specific Aim 2a, I will
define the mechanism(s) of TNF-receptor regulation by iron deficiency and in Specific Aim 2b, determine the
contribution of TNF-receptor and inflammatory cytokines to adverse interaction between inflammation and iron
deficiency observed in our mouse models. This project has important and broad translation potential, and seeks
to answer high-impact mechanistic questions about the regulation of iron during pregnancy and iron pathologies
outside of pregnancy. While developing my full potential as a scientist, I aim to expand our knowledge of iron
disorders in pregnancy and in other disease states where iron dysregulation contributes to their pathogenesis."
10764918,"Abstract: DA neuron degeneration, resulting in deficient DA signaling, underpins the debilitating motor
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Among DA neurons, those located in ventral tier of the substantia nigra
pars compacta (SNc), are particularly vulnerable, compared to those in the dorsal tier of the SNc or ventral
tegmental area (VTA). A mechanistic explanation of selective DA neuron vulnerability remains an important
goal, that has been hampered in part by a lack of understanding of the intrinsic differences between DA neurons.
 We hypothesize that even within a single neuroanatomical cluster like the SNc, there exist DA
subtypes with distinct developmental histories and intrinsic properties that may influence their vulnerability.
Single cell expression profiling based DA neuron classification from our lab revealed the presence of a key
SNc population defined by Sox6 and Aldh1a1 - this subtype was located in the ventral tier of the SNc, and was
preferentially vulnerable in a toxin model of PD. Our preliminary data indicate that this population exists in
human SNc, and is also selectively vulnerable in post-mortem PD samples. To interrogate the basis for
selectively vulnerability in the SNc in depth, we next developed a set of intersectional genetic strategies, which
strikingly defined a fault-line in the SNc defined by Sox6 expression, with Sox6+ cells being located ventrally
and Sox6- cells forming the dorsal tier. Building on these studies, several key questions remain unanswered.
Are dorsal and ventral SNc subtypes developmentally distinct? Do these neurons have different anatomical
features and DA release characteristics? Is the size of arborizations of these neurons, a property linked to
vulnerability, different? Are calcium fluxes and mitochondrial bioenergetic properties distinct?
 To answer these questions, in Aim 1, we will determine the origin of SNc neuron subtypes. We will use
intersectional, subtractive, and inducible genetic approaches, as well as a novel progenitor anchored fate
mapping approach (PRISM) to test the hypothesis that the dorsal and ventral tier DA neurons are
developmentally distinguished by Sox6. We will then test the potential of Sox6+ medial vs Sox6- lateral floor
plate progenitors to give rise to SNc neurons when transplanted into a PD model. In Aim 2, we will examine the
arborization of genetically defined SNc neurons, since this feature has been linked to their vulnerability. Using
a new sparse labeling tool, we will plot the projections of genetically defined SNc DA neuron subtypes, and
determine the size of their arbors, and explore the molecular determinants of extensive arborization. We will
also study DA release from axons and dendrites to determine if dorsal and ventral tier neurons are
distinguishable by these criteria, also linked to vulnerability. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the SNc
DA neuron subtypes have distinctive physiological properties and that these differences translate into
differences in mitochondrial oxidant stress in somatodendritic and axonal compartments. Overall, our studies
redefining the SNc based on lineage will provide important insights into selective vulnerability."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer mortality in the United States. HCC is
preventable, and it disproportionately affects migrants with unrecognized asymptomatic Chronic Viral Hepatitis
(CVH). The long-term goal of this project is to reduce the occurrence of preventable liver cancer in migrant
populations. The overall objective of this proposal is to estimate the Chronic Viral Hepatitis (CVH) and
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) prevalence among migrants, to detect key identifiers associated with high-
burden groups, and to describe the comorbidities and outcomes of those groups. The purpose of achieving this
goal is to reduce the occurrence of preventable liver cancer in migrant populations. This study will contribute to
this through the generation of the epidemiological data required for patients, practitioners, and policymakers
alike to more readily identify the migrant groups that would benefit most from strategic screening and
surveillance.
The central hypothesis is that HCC and CVH risk and outcomes among migrants can be estimated by
demographics. This will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Establish prevalence of CVH and HCC
among migrant populations; and 2) Identify CVH and HCC comorbidities and outcomes within the migrant
population. Under the first aim, a proven CVH and HCC disease model will be paired with migrant population
statistics to establish the risk profiles for distinct migrant populations, including age group and country-of-origin.
Under the second aim, an existing retrospective, population-wide health dataset will be utilized to identify
common concomitant disease and outcomes among distinct migrant populations. The proposed research is
innovative because it focuses on identifying key characteristics unique to specific migrant populations and
establishing the associated CVH and HCC risk profiles. If achieved, the results are expected to be significant
because they will contribute to resolving the current knowledge gaps in the disease burden and disparities of
distinct migrant populations, allowing for risk stratifying and appropriate modifications to impact screening
policy and practice."

A large and growing number of pediatric diabetes cases cannot be classified at diagnosis with the current criteria,
particularly among non-Caucasian children. The longitudinal observation of the clinical course that is often
needed to classify diabetes causes harmful delays in the correct treatment. Mistakes in diagnosis and treatment
may contribute to the higher frequency of diabetic complications in racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, there is a critical
need for robust criteria that can be applied at diagnosis to inform clinical decisions in children of all racial/ethnic
backgrounds. The long-term objective is to characterize pediatric diabetes at onset to inform clinical
management in a timely fashion and thus, ultimately improve outcomes in racially/ethnically diverse children. As
preliminary data, the applicants have developed and validated type 1 diabetes (T1D) Genetic Risk Scores
(GRSs) that, in adults with unclear diabetes, identify those with T1D, defined by rapid insulin dependence; and
have also demonstrated that a T1D GRS improves the current predictive model for progression to T1D in
individuals at risk. The central hypothesis of this application is that T1D GRSs, in combination with islet
autoantibodies and other factors at diabetes onset, can be used in racially/ethnically diverse children to identify
those who have T1D, defined by rapid loss of C-peptide (measure of beta-cell function), as this is the T1D
characteristic with the largest clinical impact. The rationale for this proposal is that timely characterization of
diabetes, which is particularly difficult in minority children, will facilitate early establishment of the correct
treatment, improve diabetes outcomes and lower the costs of diabetes, which are currently over $327 billion
yearly. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in racially/ethnically diverse children with
diabetes by assessing the ability of T1D GRSs, in combination with other factors, to identify those who have
T1D, defined as insulin deficiency (low C-peptide), in a cross-sectional (Specific Aim 1) and prospective (Specific
Aim 2) manner. This project is significant because it is ultimately expected to improve the treatment of pediatric
diabetes and thus its clinical outcomes, with particular impact on disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups. This project
is innovative because it seeks to shift the current clinical and research practices by proposing to utilize genetics
as a novel, affordable, time-independent strategy to diagnose T1D, identified by a clinically relevant
characteristic."
10767884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anthracycline-based chemotherapy, an effective treatment for many types of cancer, has long been associated
with substantial cardiotoxicity. As one of the most commonly used anthracycline anticancer agent, doxorubicin
(DOX) induces DNA damage and subsequent cardiomyocyte apoptosis, eventually resulting in cardiomyopathy
and heart failure. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of DOX-induced apoptosis is of paramount
importance for cardioprotection. Our published work has identified cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) as a critical
mediator of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Mechanistically, CDK2 augments forkhead box O1 (FOXO1)-dependent
expression of Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein indispensable for DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that cardiac CDK2 activity determines chemotherapy sensitivity (chemosensitivity)
in the heart. CDK2 is best known for its classical role in cell cycle progression in proliferating cells, and its activity
is tightly controlled by multiple proteins involved in cell cycle regulation. Since cardiomyocytes are postmitotic
cells with minimal cell cycle activity, it remains to be determined how CDK2 activity is regulated in the cardiac
settings. Interestingly, our preliminary results revealed that CDK2 was activated by CDK7, but inhibited by
retinoblastoma-like 2 (RBL2) in cardiomyocytes. In this application, we propose to tackle the roles of these cell
cycle proteins in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac chemosensitivity. This proposal has three Specific Aims:
1) Define the role of CDK7 in DOX-induced CDK2 activation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis; 2) Assess the
feasibility of the CDK7-CDK2 axis as a new drug target for DOX cardiotoxicity; and 3) Determine how RBL2
regulates CDK2 activity and cardiac DOX sensitivity. Our approach is innovative because various state-of-the-
art systems will be used, including immunocompetent mouse tumor allograft model and genetically engineered
mouse models. The novel mechanisms established in this application will have great translational potential, and
could lay the foundation for developing new cardioprotective strategies during cancer treatment."

An RNA sequence with all its diverse modifications constitutes ‘true’ information content of the RNA. Defects in
RNA modifications account for >100 human diseases, such as breast cancer, type-2 diabetes and obesity,
affecting millions of Americans. Despite its significance, the true sequence of a RNA, i.e., identity and location
of each and every nucleotide building block (modified or not) within a full-length RNA, remains a mystery, mainly
because of the lack of a general method to directly sequence any nucleotide, especially modified nucleotides
(including unknown ones) at single-nucleotide resolution. No existing technology can sequence all modifications
simultaneously to unfold the true RNA sequences at a large scale or the transcriptomic level.
 What complicates RNA modification studies is that >170 modification types have been discovered, and
not all of nucleotide modifications are modified completely to 100% at their RNA sites. They are even
undetectable by NGS-based technologies, which require the conversion of RNA to cDNAs that do not have any
modification information. Tools to map RNA modifications are limited only to a few popular modifications, and
can usually analyze only one modification type at a time. Mass spectrometry (MS) is currently the only technique
that can characterize all RNA modifications; however, conventional MS methods lose information regarding the
location and co-occurrence of modified nucleotides.
 To resolve these outstanding issues, we have recently developed a series of novel next generation mass
spectrometry-based sequencing (NextGen MassSpec-Seq) approaches that can de novo directly sequence
tRNAs without a cDNA and can sequence and quantify all nucleotide modifications simultaneously. For the
duration of this proposal, we will further develop NextGen MassSpec-Seq to sequence tRNAs efficiently in
different cellular and even disease conditions, make it scalable toward high throughput, and expand its
application to simultaneously sequence and map all modifications quantitatively on any RNA type and at the
transcriptomic level. Specifically, we propose to develop MS for large-scale de novo sequencing of full-length
tRNAs, together with all diverse nucleotide modifications (Aim 1), empower MS to simultaneously sequence and
quantify multiple RNA modifications, allowing quantitative mapping at single nucleotide and stoichiometric
precision (Aim 2), scale up NextGen MassSpec-Seq and combine it with high-throughput NGS sequencing for
direct sequencing of diverse RNA modifications at the transcriptomic level (Aim 3). Our tool will address a long-
standing issue of how to reveal the ‘true” RNA sequences and provide a transformative tool for studying RNA
modifications, which will promote better understanding of functions of post-transcriptional modifications and their
correlations to RNA-related diseases and pandemics."
10873285,"Insomnia is a prevalent health problem associated with adverse cardiovascular, metabolic, and mental health
outcomes. Previously proposed subtypes, based on traditional clinical measures, have poor reliability and validity
and have not proven useful for guiding insomnia treatment decisions. Based on a large base of preliminary data
from various domains and several investigative groups, we have identified a particular phenotype, insomnia with
short sleep duration (ISS), that is associated with increased risk for adverse health outcomes, greater
physiological hyperarousal as indicated by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation, and worse
response to Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I). The proposed study represents the next
logical extension of our previous observations: To determine the efficacy of CBT-I in individuals with
ISS vs. Insomnia with normal sleep duration (INS) among adults with elevated blood pressure (BP), and
to examine the efficacy of trazodone among non-remitters to CBT-I. CBT-I is recommended as first-line
treatment for insomnia, and trazodone is a widely-prescribed but grossly understudied medication for insomnia.
In addition, our pilot data demonstrate differential efficacy of CBT-I and trazodone in ISS and INS: trazodone,
but not CBT-I, increases objective total sleep time (TST), and lowers BP and evening cortisol in ISS. We will
conduct a 4-site cohort study followed by a placebo-controlled RCT in 600 adults (≥18y) with insomnia. The
cohort study will examine the efficacy of CBT-l among individuals with ISS vs. INS phenotypes (n=300 each),
defined by polysomnographic (PSG) TST. The subsequent RCT will compare the efficacy of trazodone vs.
placebo among CBT-I non-remitters. Investigators at the 4 study sites (Hershey, Denver, Pittsburg, and Quebec)
have a long history of collaboration and successful completion of NIH-funded mechanistic and clinical trial
studies. Our primary outcome will be the insomnia remission at 8 weeks, defined as Insomnia Severity Index
(ISI) <8; ISI is the gold-standard self-report measure of insomnia symptoms. Secondary outcomes will include
ISI (continuous), objective (i.e., PSG and actigraphy) measures of sleep efficiency (in the CBT-I cohort study)
and TST, HBP, and evening cortisol (in the trazodone-placebo RCT). In exploratory analyses, we will test
whether changes in evening cortisol mediate the effect of trazodone on objective TST and HBP. Outcomes will
be assessed at 8 weeks and 6 months following the end of treatment to evaluate the durability of treatment
effects. Demonstrating a differential efficacy of CBT-I as a function of insomnia phenotype would aid the goals
of precision medicine, which directs therapy on the basis of clinical phenotypes and physiology as well as
genetics. Although CBT-I is recommended as first-line treatment for all adults with insomnia, finding a worse
response in the ISS phenotype will lead to reconsidering this current guideline in lieu of matching patients'
phenotype to treatment. Demonstrating the efficacy of trazodone among CBT-I non-remitters will fill an obvious
and important knowledge gap in insomnia treatment l as it pertains to its current wide-spread off-label use."
10789884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High levels of food motivation among young children are heritable, track over time, and associated with
elevated risks of unhealthy eating and obesity. Despite significant growth of family-based obesity prevention
efforts, the evidence base is remarkably scant on parenting highly food motivated children to prevent obesity
and poor dietary outcomes. The need to move away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to food parenting is
particularly pronounced for children from racial and ethnic minority families with low income that experience
greater disparities in obesity, are underrepresented in the food parenting and family-based prevention
literatures, and for whom prevention efforts have had limited success to date. Our goal is to generate a
robust basic science evidence for parenting highly food motivated children to prevent excessive
dietary intakes and body mass index (BMI) gains during the preschool years among racial/ethnic
minority families with low incomes. Using a prospective cohort design, we propose to follow 450 Hispanic
and Black caregiver/child dyads with low incomes at three time points as children transition from preschool to
elementary school, when significant numbers of children begin to experience problems of poor diet quality and
obesity. We will recruit children with varying food motivation to understand whether highly food motivated
children have different needs than other children. We propose a multi-method approach using state-of-the-art
measures, including ecological momentary assessment, to comprehensively investigate the amount, types,
and consistency of food parenting practices (i.e., specific, goal-oriented behaviors) needed to prevent food
motivated behaviors, excessive dietary intake, and BMI gains in children. Specifically, we propose to
comprehensively evaluate the role of structure (i.e., theoretically supportive) and its differentiation from more
coercive types of food parenting control. Aim 1 will characterize multi-dimensional eating behavior profiles and
obtain evidence of validity via associations with observed food motivated behaviors, excessive dietary intakes,
and BMI gains over 2 y. Aim 2 will evaluate the amount, type(s), and consistency of food parenting structure
needed to prevent food motivated behaviors, excessive dietary intakes, and BMI gains among highly food
motivated vs. other children over 2 y. Aim 3 will evaluate whether structured food parenting practices are more
beneficial in the context of global approaches to feeding or feeding styles that involve high levels of control
(i.e., authoritarian) vs. more balanced styles (i.e., authoritative). Findings will 1) generate a basic science
evidence base on food parenting approaches for highly food motivated children that currently does not exist, 2)
provide greater specificity for family-based prevention efforts, and 3) support equity in prevention by
representing populations who experience greater disparities, are underrepresented in research, and for whom
prevention efforts have had limited success."

 Despite advances in sequencing, imaging and screening technologies, morphological changes in nuclear
structure are still utilized as a common and reliable diagnosis of cancer. Healthy cells invariably have ellipsoid,
smooth nuclear shape and distinctive chromatin distribution, while cancerous cells are characterized by irregular,
jagged nuclear shape and disrupted chromatin distribution. Relatedly, one of the most commonly mutated
proteins in human cancers is a component of the chromatin remodeler BAF complex known as ARID1A. These
mutations lose nucleosome sliding activity, leading to altered transcriptome and cancer progression. As a
structural scaffold of the BAF complex, many of the mutations in ARID1A that cause cancer result in early
truncation and lead to loss of BAF complex assembly. However, driver mutations also exist in the relatively
uncharacterized intrinsically disordered regions of ARID1A whose molecular mechanism is unknown.
 Investigations into nuclear organization have identified the importance of intrinsically disordered regions
and phase separation in dictating overall nuclear structure and organization, as well as forming nuclear bodies
like the nucleolus, and chromatin compartments like heterochromatin, but until recently we have not been able
to control this organization, or link it conclusively to chromatin compartment function. The Brangwynne lab has
developed optogenetic tools that allow for control of in vivo biophysical behavior of condensates.
 As a Life Science Research Fellow through the Mark Foundation for Cancer Research, I have determined
the role of chromatin-chromatin crosslinking protein HP1a in determining nuclear shape and mechanics, as well
as discovered rules for chromatin inclusion, exclusion, and compaction dictated by phase separated
compartments. In this proposal I will expand my research to understand the biophysical changes that occur in
these nuclear compartments upon ARID1A mutations that drive cancer, and how this is connected to their
disease phenotype. In Aim 1, I will interrogate interactions that dictate how condensates interact with chromatin,
and utilize light-triggered phase separation to modulate chromatin compaction and transcription in living cells. In
Aim 2, I will determine how the chromatin polymer directs phase separation, and how nuclear stiffness influences
nuclear body volume and functional output. In Aim 3, under the guidance of my co-mentor Dr. Cigall Kadoch, I
will utilize knowledge gained in Aims 1 and 2 to build a molecular mechanism of BAF complex proteins ARID1A
and ARID1B in oncogenesis, including the roles of their IDRs in targeting BAF complex activity and effects of
cancer-associated mutations on condensation behavior, sequence targeting and transcriptional output.
 With the support of my mentors and the greater research environment at both Princeton University and
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, I will have access to unique tools, and will receive training in cancer biology
methods, biophysical theory, and next-generation sequencing assays. Together, these aims will provide a new
perspective on nuclear organization in cancer that may lead to novel venues of therapeutics."

Integrated time nanosecond pulse irreversible electroporation (INSPIRE) is a minimally invasive treatment for
inoperable solid tumors. This treatment uses ultrashort electrical pulses to destabilize the cell membrane and
induce a tunable combination of necrotic and apoptotic cell death within a well-defined volume. The therapy is
implemented by introducing one or more electrodes into the tumor then delivering a series of 500ns to 2000ns
electrical pulses between an electrode and an external grounding pad. To enable treatment of tumors which
occur near our around critical structures active temperature feedback is utilized to limit Joule heating and prevent
deleterious thermal injury. Using a combination of ex vivo, in vivo, and computational results we hypothesize that
INSPIRE will be a safe and effective treatment for the vast majority of inoperable tumors utilizing a single
applicator approach and a compatible pulse generator capable of high voltage outputs when active temperature
control is utilized to prevent off-target thermal injury. This proposal will leverage recent developments in high
voltage power electronics to develop new instrumentation which is capable of safely administering these
treatments in vivo. The safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of these treatments will be evaluated in a combination
of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models and the data generated in these studies will be utilized to optimize treatment
planning algorithms and clinical applicators designs. The study will culminate with an in vivo study demonstrating
the safety and efficacy of these treatments against spontaneous liver tumors in canine veterinary patients."
10756122,"Innate Allorecognition in Clinical Organ Transplantation
Slow attrition of organ allografts after the first post-transplant year (long-term graft loss) remains
a significant problem in clinical transplantation. We hypothesize in this grant application that
innate allorecognition – the activation of recipient monocytes by allodeterminants on graft cells –
is an important driver of long-term graft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Innate allorecognition
stimulates monocyte differentiation into antigen-presenting, cytotoxic, and innate memory cells
that propagate the adaptive alloimmune response or cause graft damage directly. A key
allodeterminant responsible for innate allorecognition and memory is the polymorphic
transmembrane molecule Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRPa). Based on compelling mouse
and human data, we propose to test in Aim 1 the clinical hypothesis that SIRPa mismatch between
the donor and recipient is a significant, independent risk factor for chronic alloimmune injury and
long-term graft loss. Two large cohorts of donor/recipient kidney transplant pairs on whom
granular clinical and protocol biopsy data are available will be genotyped and studied. In Aim 2,
we will test the mechanistic hypothesis that the adverse effects of SIRPa mismatching are
mediated via recipient monocyte activation and differentiation. Phenotypic, transcriptional, and
functional analysis will be performed on peripheral blood monocytes, coupled with spatial profiling
of biopsy samples. We believe that the proposal is significant because the SIRPa genotyping
strategy can be readily translated to clinical practice, and mechanistic insights gained can lead to
druggable targets. The proposal is innovative because it explores a novel concept, innate
allorecognition, that goes beyond the traditional T, B, and Ab-centric approaches to the rejection
problem and one that has not been explored in humans yet."

Cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) in combination with aromatase inhibitors is the first-line
treatment for ER+ advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Despite CDK4/6 inhibitors significantly improve
overall survival of such patients, not all patients respond to these drugs and most patients whose tumors
initially respond to CDK4/6i eventually develop acquired resistance. Although many efforts have been invested
into the studying mechanism of resistance, CDK4/6i resistance remains a big challenge for HR+ breast cancer.
Thus, it is urgent to develop new approaches to overcome resistance in CDK4/6i resistant breast cancer
(CRBC). O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is one type of glycosylation that occurs when a
monosaccharide, O-GlcNAc, is added onto serine or threonine residues of proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase
(OGT). O-GlcNAcylation is involved in a range of cellular activities and aberrant O-GlcNAcylation has been
implicated in a host of diseases including cancer. However, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in cancer drug
resistance remains largely unknown.
 Through an innovative quantitative high throughput combination screen (qHTCS) and follow-up
extensive preliminary studies using cellular and molecular approaches, we identified a novel OGT-mediated
mechanism regulating the resistance to CDK4/6i in ER+ breast cancer. The major objective of this proposal is
to determine the role of OGT-mediated pathway in the regulation of CDK4/6i resistance in CRBC cells.
Specifically, we will (1) investigate the molecular mechanism of how OGT-mediated pathway regulates
CDK4/6i resistance in CRBC cells, (2) evaluate the effects of newly identified drug combinational treatments on
palbociclib resistance using resistant PDX and syngeneic models, (3) conduct clinical study to further evaluate
the correlation between OGT-mediated pathway and CDK4/6i resistance in tumors from patients. The
completion of proposed studies will not only elucidate a novel mechanism regulating CDK4/6i resistance in
ER+ breast cancer, but also provide an innovative therapeutic strategy to treat CRBC patients."
10770405,"Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) are frequently diagnosed with extensive metastatic
disease, resulting in a poor prognosis. In HGSOC, metastasis occurs primarily by transcoelomic spread, where
tumor cells detach from the primary tumor, float through the peritoneal fluid, and attach to the mesothelial layer
to form new metastases. Tumor cells in patient ascites exist as single cells or in multi-cellular aggregates
similar in size to experimental spheroids. We hypothesize that single cell and aggregate-based metastasis are
distinct processes in HGSOC transcoelomic spread. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize a combination of
engineering-based approaches (in vitro culture systems, multivariate modeling, computational fluid dynamics)
and biological methods (molecular and cellular assays, analysis of patient samples, xenograft models). This
proposal leverages a diverse, collaborative team that includes experts in engineering, biology, and the clinical
presentation of HGSOC. Completion of the proposed studies will result in an improved understanding of
mechanisms regulating transcoelomic spread and identification of potential targets for future work to control

Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million adults over the age of 65. Cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR-CM)
is a cause of HF in ~10% of older adults and leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Musculoskeletal
manifestations are common in ATTR-CM and occur 5-10 years prior to onset of HF. Exercise intolerance, a
cardinal feature, is traditionally attributed to cardiac dysfunction but contributing systemic mechanisms have not
been evaluated. Tafamidis, a transthyretin stabilizer, is the only approved therapy for ATTR-CM. It slows disease
progression, prolongs life, and reduces HF hospitalizations. However, it does not improve functional capacity-
no therapeutic intervention has been shown to do so in ATTR-CM. The central premise of this proposal is that
skeletal muscle dysfunction from amyloidosis and HF severely limits aerobic capacity and, thus, quality of life in
ATTR-CM, and that targeted exercise training will improve quality of life by improving skeletal muscle
performance and aerobic capacity. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and the short physical
performance battery (SBBP), including a leg extensor muscle power assessment will be used to achieve the
following specific aims; 1) to compare skeletal muscle performance in ATTR-CM and non-amyloid HF; and 2) to
determine improvements in aerobic capacity and quality of life due to 12 weeks of supervised exercise training
in patients with ATTR-CM. To achieve the second aim, we use a personalized exercise intervention developed
and led by Dr Bhasin’s team at the Boston Older Americans Independence Center (Boston OAIC) at BWH.
Dr. Cuddy is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH)
who is highly qualified and invested in leading this study. She is a cardiologist and an expert in cardiac
amyloidosis with a track record of successful research, including publications and awards. Her long-term career
goal is to be become a clinician-scientist at the forefront of optimizing quality of life in adults with ATTR-CM. This
research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to
provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in CV medicine, with
a well-qualified mentorship team led by Dr. Sharmila Dorbala. Data collected in this proposal on systemic
dysfunction and the efficacy of exercise training in this population will ultimately inform future therapeutic trials.
An outstanding mentoring team and advisory committee of established scientists in the fields of CV medicine,
CV imaging, Aging, and Function-promoting therapies, will guide the candidate in her transition to scientific
independence over the course of the award period."
10841050,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Technology development is a stated goal of the NIH. Myriad promising technologies have been developed, yet few cross the chasm to adoption. Few NIH-funded researchers are trained to develop and sustain transformative clinical care pathways that harness novel, evidence-based technologies to improve patient health. This training grant proposes to close this gap. Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent medical complaints and leads to 2 million gastroenterology referrals each year in the US. For symptomatic constipation refractory to laxatives, practice guidelines recommend physiological testing to identify anorectal evacuation disorders that preferentially respond to safe and effective pelvic rehabilitation therapy typically delivered by a physical therapist. Unfortunately, 98% of patients never undergo such testing and instead undergo unnecessary and repeated diagnostic procedures and rotating trials of ineffective and costly laxatives. This is largely because high-tech testing is limited to specialty motility centers. We recently developed and prospectively validated the ability of a simple, novel point-of-care device (RED) to predict treatment outcomes with subsequent physical therapy during the initial office consultation. We propose to develop and pilot a rapid clinical care pathway anchored on a provider-facing clinical decision support tool (INTEGRATE) to facilitate adoption of RED and transform care for chronic constipation in general gastroenterology practice. The training plan aims to prepare the applicant for a career vested in transforming healthcare delivery for patients affected by GI motility disorders by developing rapid clinical care pathways that promote targeted therapy harnessing evidence-based diagnostic technology. Targeted advanced coursework will provide training in behavioral economics, user-centered design, and implementation science to facilitate these career goals. In Research Aim 1, we will conduct a needs assessment with patient and provider co-production partners to develop our intervention to nudge providers toward using RED and to facilitate related care. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the usability of our intervention to ensure that it triggers appropriately and fits within clinical workflow. In Aim 3, we will launch our intervention in a regional gastroenterology practice to evaluate its effectiveness and implementation in practice. The project will provide the necessary preliminary data for an R01 supporting a larger, randomized trial. By the conclusion of the K23, the applicant will be positioned for academic success with a niche in creating transformative clinical care pathways harnessing diagnostic technology to pull tertiary care paradigms downstream to general care settings to improve the health of patients affected by the GI motility disorders, the most common GI disorders in practice."

characterizing the impact of exercise on the risk for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. He has held
leadership roles at UT Southwestern and nationally. Furthermore, he has mentored numerous trainees at all
levels, facilitating their transition to indepdnence as evidenced by their own independent research careers.
Beginning in 2019, he was named the new PI of the Dallas Heart Study, where he is leading a multidisciplinary
effort to characterize the biology of healthy aging in a large, multiethnic cohort. He also developed and serves
as the director of the DHS Exercise Testing Laboratory where his lab performs comprehensive exercise testing
on DHS participants. His current research is funded by a large institional commitment that supports the 3rd
examination of the DHS. His research is also supported by additional funding from the NIH. Therefore he is
well positioned to lead an expansion of his mentoring program that will be supported by this K24 mechanism and
support his long-term career goals: (1) Lead a major research program focused on the prevention of heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF); (2) Improve the understanding of the mechanisms contributing to low
exercise capacity in middle age and identify targeted strategies for treatment; and (3) Develop a new generation
of clinical investigators equipped with knowledge and skill set to conduct high-quality, patient oriented
cardiovascular research. During this award period, the PI will acquire additional leadership training and gain
exposure to advanced imaging techniques using high-field, 7T MRI through attending focused training
experiences and hands-on work with his advanced imaging colleagues. Based on prior research established by
the PI, the central hypothesis of this application is that exercise intolerance in older HFpEF patients reflects the
natural history of low exercise capacity in midlife. The Specific Aims of the proposal are the following: Specific
Aim #1: Characterize peripheral mechanisms of reduced exercise capacity in otherwise healthy middle-aged
and older adults at increased risk for HFpEF. DHS participants will complete (1) functional measurements [VO2
kinetics and oxygen extraction (AVO2 difference) at submax exercise]; and (2) structural measurements (skeletal
muscle volume, muscle fat infiltration). A subset DHS participants will also undergo additional functional in vivo
measurements of mitochondrial function using our established 7T MRI/MRS platform. Specific Aim #2: Compare
the peripheral mechanisms of EI in patients with established HFpEF with otherwise healthy adults with
similar/matched peak V02 using the same measurements as in Aim 1. Trainees will gain experience in patient-
oriented research and participate in informal and formal research training experiences led by the PI as part of
his institutional role in mentoring trainees in the CTSA."
10751054,"Project Summary
This application to the K01 Career Development Award is to support Dr. Katharine Walter in her training and
research into new methods for tuberculosis genomic epidemiology. Dr. Walter’s research focuses on
developing and applying tools to harness pathogen variation to characterize infectious disease transmission
and evolution in order to interrupt transmission in high-incidence, resource-poor settings. Dr. Walter’s research
proposal leverages within-host Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic variation to reconstruct tuberculosis
transmission chains. Genomic epidemiology studies are increasingly used to characterize tuberculosis
transmission. However, current approaches have limited resolution because they sequence a single M.
tuberculosis genome from each infected individual. Despite the epidemiological and clinical significance of
within-host M. tuberculosis diversity, tools to consistently and accurately recover such diversity and to
incorporate this information into transmission inferences are lacking. This research proposal aims to (1)
systematically assess methods for recovering within-host diversity from sputum samples collected during
active screening in a high-incidence setting, (2) measure the M. tuberculosis diversity that is transmitted and
persists in a secondary infection, and (3) develop a model to infer transmission linkages using within-host M.
tuberculosis diversity data. The proposed project will leverage and expand upon the primary mentor’s NIH-
funded R01 studies (AI130058, AI149620; PI: Andrews). In a five-year training plan, Dr. Walter will acquire
skills in (1) statistical analysis and visualization of genomic data, (2) mathematical modeling of evolution and
transmission, and (3) writing open and reproducible bioinformatic workflows for genomic data. Dr. Walter will
be mentored by Dr. Jason Andrews, Associate Professor of Medicine at Stanford School of Medicine, a global
expert in the diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis in resource-limited settings. She will be co-
mentored by Dr. Theodore Cohen, Associate Professor of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale
School of Public Health, whose research pioneered the study of mixed strain infections in M. tuberculosis. In
addition, Dr. Walter will collaborate closely with Dr. Julio Croda, an infectious disease physician-scientist and
Professor at Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, who has extensive experiencing leading
prospective cohorts, genomic epidemiology studies, and clinical trials on tuberculosis and tropical diseases in
Brazil. She will also collaborate with Dr. Caroline Colijn, Professor of Mathematics at Simon Fraser University,
who has developed several statistical approaches for transmission inference. The results of this research and
training proposal will provide the foundation for a future R01 application, which will develop an automated
pipeline for real-time transmission inference and TB incidence estimation harnessing population-level, multi-
year genomic surveillance data. This proposal will provide her the research, training, and professional
development time to transition to an independent faculty position."
10756161,"Abstract
 This proposal aims to develop advanced data integration methods for improving genetic risk prediction
in under-represented non-European populations. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have yielded
important biological insights into the heritable basis of many complex traits and diseases, and polygenic risk
scores (PRS) have shown promising potentials for disease risk stratification. However, since the vast majority of
participants in large-scale genomic datasets are from European ancestry (EA) populations, the performance of
current PRS is much poorer in non-EA populations than in EA populations, which may exacerbate existing health
disparities. Despite some recent inclusive data collection efforts, current risk prediction methods cannot effectively
address the heavily unbalanced sample sizes across populations. Robust data integration methods are needed to
leverage similarities in genetic architectures across ancestral populations, phenotypic correlations and pleiotropy,
and variant functional annotations while accounting for different sources of heterogeneity. Moreover, as various
national and institutional biobanks become available, efficient information-sharing strategies with data privacy
considerations are needed for combining data across biobanks to improve sample diversity and sample size. This
proposal will address these needs by developing a methodological framework with advanced transfer learning (TL)
and federated learning (FL) techniques for integrating various sources of data to bridge the gap of risk prediction
across populations. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop a TL method to integrate ancestrally diverse data
based on high-dimensional models with a distance-based regularization to characterize the similarities across
populations, and a communication-efficient FL algorithm that jointly fits the TL model across multiple biobanks with
only summary-level statistics. In Aim 2, we will develop methods that enable joint analyses of multiple phenotypes
in association tests and risk prediction models. We will develop an FL algorithm to combine data from multiple
biobanks for cross-phenotype association test, and a TL method with an angle-based regularization to leverage
genetic correlations among mixed types of phenotypes in risk prediction. In Aim 3, we will develop knowledge-
graph-based TL methods that leverage the shared latent spaces between phenotype-genotype knowledge graphs
constructed from different ancestral populations and enable the incorporation of functional annotations. In Aim 4,
we will develop open-access statistical software capable of implementing the proposed methods in both offline
and cloud computing environments, and apply the proposed methods to the analysis of major depressive disorder
and cardiovascular diseases using data from the All of Us program, eMERGE, and the UK biobank."
10758278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Training can sharpen and refine our perceptual skills. In the auditory system, this process— termed
perceptual learning— shapes the acquisition of both native and non-native languages, and can improve
speech and music recognition in users of assisted listening devices. Previous work has highlighted important
contributions of non-sensory processes (such as attention and reward) to perceptual learning, but the
underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of
the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a prefrontal cortical region implicated in signaling reward and expectation, and
in exerting top-down control of sensory cortical processing. This project will explore the contribution of the OFC
to auditory perceptual learning in a classic model organism for auditory studies, the Mongolian gerbil. Our
overarching hypothesis, informed by previous and ongoing work, is that training on an auditory task
strengthens a descending projection from the OFC to the auditory cortex, leading to gradual improvements in
auditory cortical sensitivity that underlie perceptual learning. We propose three specific aims to test this
hypothesis. In Aim 1, we use multichannel electrophysiology and pathway-specific fiber photometry to
determine whether training on an auditory task strengthens a descending projection from the OFC to auditory
cortex by increasing presynaptic activity. In Aim 2, we combine pharmacological and optogenetic methods to
determine whether the OFC modulates auditory cortical processing and/or perception in behaving animals via
a descending monosynaptic projection, and reveal whether this capability is enhanced after perceptual
learning. Finally, in Aim 3 we determine whether optogenetic activation of auditory cortical-projecting neurons
in the OFC is sufficient for improving auditory cortical and perceptual sensitivity in behaving animals in the
absence of training. In summary, our experiments combine a powerful array of in vivo tools to dissect the
neural circuit mechanisms that support auditory perceptual learning. The importance of perceptual learning for
improving auditory skills in hearing impaired listeners, and the disruption of perceptual learning in individuals
with neurodevelopmental disorders, like dyslexia and autism, highlight an urgent need for a more complete
description of how perceptual learning is implemented in the brain."
10759440,"Flow cytometry is the tool of choice for high-speed analysis of large cell populations, with the tradeoff of lacking
intracellular spatial information. Imaging flow cytometry (IFC) has emerged as a new tool that combines
advantages of microscopy with the high speed of flow cytometry. However, they can only provide 2D images to
determine three-dimensional (3D) distribution of cellular features, have a limited field of view (FOV), and require
precise control of the fluidic system to minimize image blurring due to uncontrolled cell rotation or translation
across the FOV. The absence of 3D imaging results in ambiguity of object locations and blurring by focal depth
due to the projection of a 3D cell into a 2D image. Although in the last decades flow cytometry systems that can
actually acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial information were developed, constraints related to resolution and
samples size remained as their biggest limitation. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop the next
generation 3D imaging flow cytometers with high-throughput and high-content capabilities for 3D imaging of
hundreds to thousands of cells and spheroids per second with high resolution, for the first time. We propose to
develop such a cytometry method, using a novel microscopy method, Line Excitation Array Detection microscopy
(LEAD), that can image objects in large field of views at the rate of current 1D cytometers, but with high 3D
resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our proposed LEAD cytometer is a fast-scanned light-sheet
microscope capable of MHz frame rates. We will develop the fastest MHz line-scanning method using a
longitudinal acousto-optic deflector driven by a chirped frequency signal. We will image the scanned light sheet
using a linear silicon photomultiplier array, which will provide the sensitivity required when scanning so quickly,
and the parallel readout required for such high frame rates. First, we will develop linear LEAD 3D imaging flow
cytometry at sub-micron scale resolution and small FOVs. Although our preliminary data indicates we will be
able to image at 100 kHz – MHz frame rates at such high resolution with high SNR, we will perform experiments
measuring the SNR to determine the operating range of LEAD cytometry. In the second aim, we will increase
the FOV by developing two-photon LEAD imaging flow cytometry with Bessel beams. To support the larger FOV,
we will develop a 128-channel data acquisition system using eight 16-channel data acquisition cards. In the third
aim, we will develop a state-of-the-art computational infrastructure that allows for file transfers up to 25 GB/s,
storage (>100 TB), and analysis that only takes 3x the imaging time. We will use 2 deep learning models for
analysis. If successful, this high-risk/high-reward proposal would alter the imaging flow cytometry landscape.
The proposed 3D imaging flow cytometer can offer improved cell and spheroid analysis in diverse biomedical
fields such as cancer biology, microbiology, immunology, hematology, and stem cell biology. Improved sensitivity
will help users to improve research outcomes or diagnose patients with higher statistical power."
10755371,"ABSTRACT
Engineered T cell-based cancer therapies are a major advancement in cancer treatment; however the majority
of cancers still do not respond to adoptive cellular therapy. We need to “design” new T cell therapies with
increased potency, and we need to overcome cell dysfunction that occurs as T cells face chronic tumor antigen
stimulation. We and others have screened for genes that can be “knocked out” in antigen-specific T cells to
enhance their functions, but enormous opportunities still remain to “knock-in” new synthetic DNA sequences at
targeted genome sites. This proposal is focused on detailed evaluation of genes and inducible gene programs
that will enable next-generation cellular therapies for cancer. We have developed several complementary
technologies to discover synthetic gene programs that can be “inserted” into T cell genomes to enhance
therapeutic functions. We developed a CRISPR technology for high throughput pooled knock-ins to
accelerate discovery of synthetic knock-in programs (Roth et al., Cell, 2020), and have now have conducted
two screens with ~100-member libraries that include transcription factors and synthetic chimeric
receptors (“switch receptors”) to discover programs that make chronically stimulated T cells resistant to
dysfunction. In addition, we have optimized a complementary robust platform for genome-wide CRISPR
activation (CRISPRa) gain-of-function forward genetic screens in human T cells, and have already completed
systematic discovery of factors that regulate stimulation-dependent cytokine production (Schmidt and
Steinhart et al., Science, 2022). We propose to translate insights from these high-throughput discovery
efforts into preclinical testing of novel knock-in designs with screen hits in vivo using xenotransplanted mouse
models. In this proposal, we will test validated candidates from gain-of-function CRISPR PoKI (Aim 1) and
CRISPRa (Aim 2) screens to discover new components of knock-in constructs that improve cell-based T cell
therapies. We also recognize that these genetic components may be more beneficial if they are not expressed
constitutively. In Aim 3, we draw on the power of synthetic biology to engineer synthetic circuits that can
induce or repress genetic programs in response to antigen stimulation. This precise and dynamic
regulation of genetic elements has great potential to further enhance efficacy and safety of next-generation
immune cell therapies. Taken together, we present a proposal that leverages recent discoveries from
CRISPR discovery platforms and deep expertise in synthetic biology to engineer powerful “knock-in” circuits
that we will validate and study in preclinical cancer models. We leverage functional genomics, CRISPR
engineering and synthetic cell program design expertise to address insufficient T cell potency and T cell
dysfunction, which remain significant barriers to adoptive cell therapy for cancer."

The Tissue Analysis and Molecular Imaging (TAMI) Core of the Texas Medical Center (TMC) Digestive Diseases
Center (DDC) was established with the broad objective to integrate histopathology services (histology and
pathology training, support, consultation, embedding, and staining) with state-of-the-art microscopy and imaging
services. The TAMI Core user community includes over 50 digestive disease researchers at the three DDC
institutions (Baylor College of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, and MD Anderson Cancer
Center). TAMI Core has two Specific Aims: 1) To provide fundamental, reliable, tissue processing and
histopathology services regularly used by most DDC members; 2) To provide cutting-edge tissue analysis and
molecular imaging services and foster their use to meet the dynamic, evolving research needs of DDC members.
TAMI has two interdependent Components that drive its two specific aims. First, TAMI Core helps users
characterize pathological features in human and animal tissues related to gastrointestinal health by providing
access to antibody titration services, electron microscopy, and tissue preparation techniques, such as microtomy,
histochemistry, staining, laser capture and microdissection, embedding, and sample processing. Second, TAMI
Core provides its users with access to instruments capable of imaging tissues down to the level of organelle
ultrastructure to identify gastrointestinal phenotypes. This instrumentation includes confocal microscopy, super-
resolution microscopy, long-term live-cell imaging, and quantitative high-throughput imaging, in addition to other
approaches and the use of related software for performing complex image analysis.
The TAMI Core Director is Jason Mills, MD, PhD, with Deborah Schady, MD, serving as Co-Director of the Tissue
Analysis Component and Michael Mancini, PhD, as Co-Director of the Molecular Imaging component. Both co-
Directors oversee a staff of scientists and technicians that can consult and assist users with experimental design,

10747420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently, there are over 5.7 million Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients in the United States, and this number is
predicted to reach over 14 million by the year 2050. Despite decades of research, effective therapies for treating
AD remain lacking, and recent clinical trials targeting β-amyloid plaques (Aβ) have been largely unsuccessful.
Nearly two-thirds of AD patients are postmenopausal women who have lost the neuropr otective effects of
estrogens. Studies on hormone replacement therapy raised hopes that 17β-estradiol (E2) might provide an
effective treatment for preventing neuronal loss, but a large clinical trial found that conjugated estrogens caused
an increased risk of breast cancer and thrombotic events. As an alternative, we have synthesized and
characterized a non-steroidal estrogenic ligand, STX that selectively targets an unidentified receptor in the
central nervous system (CNS), but importantly STX does not engage the “classical” nuclear estrogen receptors,
which enables STX to avoid the unfavorable effects of estrogen. Orally administered STX crosses the blood
brain barrier and activates neuroprotective signaling pathways in CNS neurons. STX improves mitochondrial
function and enhances neuronal synaptic transmission. Moreover, STX protects against amyloid toxicity in
cultured hippocampal neurons, while sustained oral STX protects against amyloid toxicity in a mouse model of
AD. Therefore, STX has a high therapeutic potential, but identification of the receptor is needed for further
development as a treatment for AD. Based on physiological / pharmacological data, we hypothesize that STX
targets a Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor in CNS neurons to provide neuroprotective actions. We
propose to isolate this receptor using photo-crosslinking and click chemistries and confirm its identity via in vivo
CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis studies. We have designed and synthesized a novel bifunctional STX derivative
(BF-STX) that contains a photo-crosslinkablediazirine group and an alkyne group, which permits specific tagging
of STX-protein conjugates with a fluorophore and the isolation of STX-protein conjugates from cell lysates for
proteomic analysis. Photo-crosslinked BF-STX labels POMC-expressing hypothalamic (mHypo43) cells in vitro.
Therefore, we will: (1) photo-crosslink BF-STX to candidate receptors in mHypo43 cell lysates and isolate BF-
STX-protein conjugates from the membrane fraction via click chemistry to azide-bearing beads and analyze by
proteomics. The most promising hits will be validated by siRNA knock-down in mHypo43 cells followed by
measuring the loss of STX signaling; and (2) validate promising receptor candidates in vivo using CRISPR/Cas9
mutagenesis in POMCCre mice. Single adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors containing recombinase-dependent
Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 and a single guide RNA against each candidate receptor will be targeted to POMC
neurons. Molecular biological (single cell RT-PCR) and electrophysiological experiments will be conducted to
validate the reduction in mRNA expression and loss of physiological responses to STX. The results from these
studies will help to develop STX as a novel therapeutic for treating postmenopausal women and AD."
10802392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The RAS-Extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway controls wide-ranging cellular processes during female
germ cell development from worms to mammals. Any alteration to ERK activity disrupts germ cell development
and leads to sub-fertility or sterility. Thus, regulation of ERK activity is critical during female germ cell
development. Across evolution, ERK activation is controlled by a reversible dual phosphorylation on the TEY
motif in its active site by ERK kinase (MEK) and, dephosphorylation by DUSPs (Dual Specificity Phosphatase).
A balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of ERK by MEK (MAPK kinase) and DUSPs (the Dual
Specificity Phosphatase), respectively, tightly regulates and tunes the duration and magnitude of ERK activity
in space and time across all systems and this is best visualized in Caenorhabditis elegans oogenic germline.
C. elegans oogenic germline, like most complex biological systems, displays a controlled spatiotemporal
pattern of ERK (MPK-1 in C. elegans) activity. Active ERK MPK-1, as assayed using an antibody that detects
dual phosphorylated ERK at Threonine and Tyrosine of the TEY motif, is visualized in mid-pachytene stage of
meiosis I; dephosphorylated and thus undetected in the late-pachytene and early-diplotene region of the
germline, corresponding with disassembly of the meiotic axis to trigger chromosome remodeling in diplotene
stage of oocyte development. ERK MPK-1 phosphorylation is again visible in the arrested diakinetic oocytes.
Any alternation to this pattern (visualized via loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutant germlines in the mpk-
1 erk pathway) results in sub-fertility or acute sterility. Because total ERK protein is expressed throughout the
oogenic germline, this striking spatiotemporal pattern of ERK activation suggests localized activation and
inactivation of ERK MPK-1 through MEK and DUSPs. For two decades, the DUSP6/7 homolog LIP-1 (lateral
signal induced phosphatase -1) was thought to regulate ERK MPK-1 activity in the oogenic germline. However,
during the same time, several labs, including ours, observed phenotypes and results that were inconsistent
with a role for LIP-1 to be the DUSP for ERK MPK-1 during germ cell development. Through careful
reevaluation of the role of LIP-1 in oogenesis and regulation of ERK MPK-1, we showed that in fact LIP-1 does
not function as an ERK DUSP in the oogenic germline. Along this line Tischer and Schuh, 2016, had shown
that the mammalian DUSP6/7 homolog does not regulate ERK but rather targets Protein Kinase C during
oocyte meiotic maturation in mouse. Together, these results demonstrate that LIP-1 or DUSP6/7 does not
regulate ERK MPK-1 during oogenesis, leaving us with a big gap in our knowledge on molecular identity of
signaling regulators that control female fertility. The goal of this proposal are to identify the phosphatase(s) and
generate reagents to detect its expression and function during female germ cell development in worms.
Identifying the phosphatase or a combination of phosphatases that function to regulate ERK activity and ERK-
dependent events during female fertility fills a major gap in our knowledge and informs reproductive medicine."
10752658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer is responsible for the third most cancer-related deaths in the United States, and >60,000
Americans will be diagnosed in 2022. Further, patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) face a
5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Although the genetic drivers of PDAC have been well established, these
cancers remain largely refractory to treatment. To survive, PDACs depend on autophagy, an intracellular nutrient
recycling process. Autophagy provides an internal nutrient pool for tumor cell survival, and pancreatic stellate
cells also use autophagy to support their metabolic demands. Further, autophagy contributes to immune evasion,
a well-known therapeutic challenge in PDAC. Consistent with these roles, genetic autophagy inhibition has been
shown to reduce PDAC tumor growth; however, the translation of these discoveries is limited by a lack of
pharmacologic autophagy inhibitors available for preclinical use.
To address this problem, our lab developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of ULK1 (ULK-101),
a protein kinase that controls autophagy induction. Importantly, we have shown that starved cancer cells are
highly sensitive to ULK1 inhibition, consistent with autophagy-dependent survival during stress. While several
ULK1 inhibitors exist, we have demonstrated that ULK-101 is the most potent and selective to date and the ideal
candidate for preclinical investigations. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the effects of ULK-101 in mouse
models of pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that ULK-101 will suppress autophagy through ULK1 inhibition
and thereby reduce pancreatic tumor growth and improve therapeutic efficacy.
Aim 1 will use an orthotopic tumor model using human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1)
to test whether ULK-101 treatment reduces tumor progression in vivo. We will then use these orthotopic models
to assess target engagement and ULK-101 selectivity by measuring ULK1 inhibition using chemoproteomics.
These orthotopic models will also be used to evaluate the effect of ULK-101 on tumor progression, which we will
benchmark against hydroxychloroquine, an approved lysosomal inhibitor. For Aim 2, we will use a syngeneic
orthotopic tumor model with 7940b murine cells and the established pancreatic KPC mouse (LSL-KrasG12D/+,
LSL-Trp53R172H/+, Pdx1-cre model) to test whether ULK-101 will decrease tumor burden. Because autophagy
inhibition sensitizes PDACs to immunotherapy, we will also evaluate ULK-101 in combination with dual immune
checkpoint blockade (anti-CTL4 and anti-PD-1). The genetically engineered mouse model in Aim 2 features a
functional immune system, tumors at the appropriate site, and disease progression that parallels human
pancreatic cancer.
Through these thorough in vivo studies, we will examine ULK1 inhibition as a strategy for treating pancreatic
cancer and may provide evidence for further development of ULK-101 and novel autophagy inhibitors."
11011508,"Prapela proposes to complete the development of and then establish the safety, efficacy, and clinical risk/benefit of a novel hospital incubator pad that will provide a complementary treatment and the first improvement in the clinical management of apnea of prematurity (AOP) in over 20 years. Defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by hypoxemia, AOP is a major morbidity among preterm infants and a significant healthcare burden. AOP affects 70% of all early preterm births (<34 weeks gestational age) and nearly all at ≤ 28 weeks’ gestation. In the United States in 2020, the total annual direct costs associated with AOP exceeded $12 billion. While there is no consensus for treating AOP, common interventions include positional techniques, caffeine citrate, manual tactile stimulation, and supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia. Caffeine citrate is the first line of therapy as it decreases apneic episodes and reduces the need for assisted ventilation. At recommended doses, caffeine has been proven safe and effective. However, in the sole trial supporting its FDA clearance, a majority of newborns treated with caffeine citrate continued to experience apnea events. In 2015, a clinical study using a stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) investigational device reported a 50% reduction in the number of apnea events. Prapela exclusively licensed the SVS technology of the investigational device and has demonstrated technical feasibility replicating the clinically critical stimulation in prototype incubator pads. The broad objective of this SBIR Fast-Track application is to generate the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance of a novel device to reduce apnea events in preterm newborns. To accomplish this objective, Prapela proposes four Specific Aims: 1) complete development of the SVS incubator pad, 2) demonstrate the safety of the device, 3) determine the clinical efficacy of the SVS incubator pad as an adjunctive therapy to concurrent pharmacological treatment in newborns with AOP, and 4) document the benefit-risk assessment of the device from clinicians caring for AOP patients. Efficacy will be established through a masked, randomized clinical trial with newborns of <33 weeks gestational age, with postmenstrual age (PMA) of <38 weeks at the time of enrollment. The control group will receive standard therapy only with caffeine citrate and respiratory support and an inert SVS device, while the intervention group will receive standard therapy concurrent with the Prapela SVS device. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of apnea events in the three days after study entry, with a reduction in apnea events of 30% or more considered clinically significant. Questionnaires administered at the end of each experimental period to the clinicians present on the final shift will capture the benefit-risk assessment. The successful completion of the project will provide the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance and commercialization of our SVS incubator pad as a purpose-built device to improve clinical outcomes of preterm infants with AOP."
10755350,"Amino acid metabolism in tumor cells is very different from that in normal cells. The tumor-specific metabolic
pathway “glutaminolysis” focuses on glutamine. Recently, another fundamental pathway was discovered for
cancer cell proliferation: the “serine-glycine-methionine-one-carbon” pathway. Tumor cells upregulate
specific amino acid transporters to satisfy their increased need for glutamine, glycine, serine, and methionine
to fuel these pathways. Blocking the entry of these amino acids into tumor cells has potential for cancer
therapy. Recently, we provided evidence for this approach by identifying SLC6A14, an amino acid transporter
with broad specificity, that is induced in ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) and by showing that blockade
of this transporter reduces ER+ BC. But, SLC6A14 is not expressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
TNBC must rely upon a different transporter as a “fix” to its “addiction” to glutamine/serine/glycine/methionine.
We have now identified this transporter as SLC38A5, a Na+-coupled uptake system exclusively for these four
amino acids. SLC38A5 is upregulated in TNBC by WNT/DVL1. Furthermore, SLC38A5 promotes
macropinocytosis, a unique feature essential for tumor growth. Here we will show that SLC38A5 drives the
glutamine- and one-carbon metabolic pathways in TNBC and evaluate in preclinical models the potential of
this transporter as a logical drug target for TNBC. We have identified the FDA-approved drug niclosamide as
a potent inhibitor of SLC38A5 function and expression. This drug can be used pharmacologically to interrogate
the role of SLC38A5 in TNBC. We also have Slc38a5-null mice as a genetic tool for these studies.
Hypothesis: SLC38A5 drives the glutamine-dependent and one-carbon metabolic pathways in TNBC; as
such, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of SLC38A5 will block TNBC. We will test this hypothesis
with two aims: (Aim 1) Demonstrate that SLC38A5 is obligatory for glutaminolysis and one-carbon metabolic
pathway to promote cell proliferation and remodeling of the epigenetic landscape in TNBC cells and elucidate
the molecular mechanisms by which WNT/DVL1 induces SLC38A5 in these cells. Here we will use classical
as well as patient-derived xenograft TNBC cell lines. (Aim 2) Evaluate the impact of SLC38A5 loss on tumor
growth in mouse models of TNBC using Slc38a5-/- mice and niclosamide as a proof-of-concept for future use
of this transporter as a selective drug target for TNBC. Here we will use xenografts of human TNBC cell lines
in nude mice to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of niclosamide, and also compare the development/growth
of spontaneous mammary tumors in a TNBC mouse model [C3(1)-TAg mouse] with and without niclosamide
treatment (pharmacologic) and on Slc38a5+/+ and Slc38a5-/- backgrounds (genetic). Impact: With no known
targeted therapy, chemotherapy is the only option for TNBC. Establishment of SLC38A5 as a drug target
would aid future use of pharmacologics (e.g., niclosamide) to block its expression and transport function as a
targeted therapy for TNBC, either as a monotherapy or in combination with standard chemotherapeutics."

 This research program will develop accurate, detailed models of enzymatic heme degradation. In
biological systems, heme oxygenases degrade heme to non-heme iron and oxygenated organic products, such
as: biliverdin, staphylobilin, and mycobilin. In eukaryotes, the liberated non-heme iron is ultimately recycled into
iron-dependent proteins. In prokaryotes, heme oxygenases are often part of iron acquisition pathways whereby
pathogenic organisms acquire iron from host-derived heme. Despite a general understanding of the overall
reactions catalyzed by heme oxygenases, the mechanistic details of how these enzymes catalyze the insertion
of two to three oxygen atoms into a heme substrate remain poorly understood. This mechanistic knowledge is
needed to selectively target heme oxygenase without disrupting other heme-dependent proteins. Recently, we
developed new optical assays to accurately measure heme binding constants and elucidate the partitioning of
heme between heme oxygenases and other heme-dependent proteins. We have also discovered an
unprecedented, dynamic out-of-plane distortion of heme within some heme oxygenase active sites, which is
correlated with enzymatic activity. Finally, we have revealed that an active site hydrogen bond promotes heme
degradation in staphylobilin-producing heme oxygenases by stabilizing a resonance structure with a cationic
radical at the carbon site of oxygenation. In the next five years, we will employ a combined spectroscopic and
computational approach to elucidate the mechanism of heme monooxygenation to meso-hydroxyheme by
mycobilin-producing heme oxygenases, and the mechanisms of meso-hydroxyheme oxygenation by biliverdin-
and staphylobilin-producing heme oxygenases. In general, we will employ a variety of spectroscopic
techniques to characterize analogues of key enzymatic intermediates. These experimental data will be used to
develop accurate computational models of the enzymatic reactions. Ultimately, this program will provide
detailed insight into a fascinating chapter of heme biochemistry, namely, self-oxygenation."

Individuals with a family history of alcoholism (FH+) are 4 to 8 times more likely to develop an alcohol use
disorder (AUD) compared to individuals with no such family histories. We developed the Family Health
Patterns project to characterize risk-related phenotypic characteristics of FH+ young adults. During our recent
funding period, we have identified robust links between increased early life adversity (ELA) in FH+ and their (a)
blunted stress reactivity, (b) increased antisocial tendencies, (c) poor affect regulation, and (d) impaired
cognitive performance. In our neuroimaging studies, we identified diffusivity changes in frontal white matter
tracts in both FH+ young adults and children, suggesting decreased myelination and axon damage in
underlying neural circuitry. We interpret these collective findings to suggest that increased ELA in FH+
individuals induces lasting neurobiological changes and consequent behavioral effects that increase AUD risk.
To guide the present proposal, we developed a heuristic model of how ELA contributes to risk-related
phenotypic characteristics in FH+ persons. We propose that convergent epigenetic and transcriptomic
dysregulation of immune genes increase inflammation and immunoreactivity, thereby impairing myelination
and/or damaging axons in developing frontal white matter tracts. The resulting impaired communication to and
from the prefrontal cortex contributes to phenotypic characteristics of increased antisocial tendencies and
poorer affect regulation and cognitive performance, increasing AUD risk. Here we propose to test this model by
examining inflammatory gene expression, functional changes in immunoreactivity, and cerebral white matter
myelin levels and axon damage markers in FH+ and FH– young adults. We will then examine relationships of
these variables with ELA exposure and risk-related phenotypic characteristics. This proposal rigorously builds
on our extensive findings on FH+ behavioral and biological phenotypes by testing a novel, overarching model
of AUD risk. While extensive preclinical evidence exists illustrating ELA induces long-lasting dysregulation of
the immune system and resulting neural and behavioral sequela, our proposal breaks new ground by
comprehensively examining these relationships in humans using advanced immunology and multimodal
neuroimaging together with in-depth behavioral and clinical assessments."
10770527,"Project Summary
Repair of alkylation damage to the genome is critical, because such damage is cytotoxic and potentially
mutagenic. The oxidative demethylase ALKBH3 is a central component of a DNA alkylation damage repair (DAR)
pathway. Along with the activating signal co-integrator complex (ASCC), ALKBH3 demethylates adenine
methylated on the N1 position (1meA) and cytosine methylated on the N3 position (3meC) in single-strand DNA
to maintain genomic integrity. Although much is known about the biochemical mechanisms of DAR, we know
very little about the regulation of DAR pathways. DNA-alkylating drugs have been widely used in the treatment
of different cancers. Improved understanding of DAR will overcome the challenge to using these drugs more
effectively and designing additional personalized treatments for cancer. By studying prostate cancer cells, we
found that ASCC3, a subunit of ASCC, is tyrosine phosphorylated at Y1909 by fibroblast growth factor receptor
1 (FGFR1). This phosphorylation event primed ASCC3 for His phosphorylation by the histidine kinase NME2.
NME2-mediated ASCC3 His phosphorylation promoted ALKBH3 recruitment to DNA alkylation damage sites and
DAR. We knocked out NME2 in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) cells and found that 3meC and 1meA
accumulated in DNA and that these cells were particularly sensitive to DNA-alkylating agents. The translational
relevance of these findings is supported by the amplification of NME2 and ASCC3 in ~10% of NEPC and
increased expression of NME2 correlates with poor survival in NEPC patients. Based on these preliminary
findings, we hypothesize that NME2 governs genome stability by promoting ASCC3/ALKBH3 function in DAR
and that targeting this pathway sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-alkylating agents. To test this hypothesis, in this
application we propose to dissect the molecular mechanism by which NME2 promotes DAR, determine how
NME2-mediated ASCC3 phosphorylation is modulated by DNA damage signals, and decipher the role of NME2
in promoting resistance to alkylating chemotherapy in vivo. Our studies will characterize a previously unknown
role of His phosphorylation in DAR and genome stability. Built upon multidisciplinary expertise, compelling
scientific premises, and rigorous research strategy, our studies promise to provide new insights into tumor
responses to alkylating chemotherapy and may reveal targets for inhibition by small molecules that will sensitize
NEPC and other NME- and ASCC3-dependent cancers to chemotherapy with DNA-alkylating agents."
10794965,"Project Summary
 Studying regulated cell death is critical for our understanding of tumor suppression and development of
novel effective cancer therapy. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that is induced by
excessive lipid peroxidation, is morphologically and mechanistically distinct from other forms of regulated cell
death such as apoptosis. However, in contrast to our deep understanding of apoptosis, how ferroptosis is
regulated and coordinates with other cellular signaling in tumor suppression remains much less well understood.
There also exists a significant need to translate our understanding of ferroptosis mechanisms into effective
cancer therapies. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism(s) of action of anti-neoplastic agents
and/or combinations of agents that target ferroptosis in cancer therapy. The objective of this application is to
determine the role and mechanisms of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical sensor of cellular energy
status, in regulating ferroptosis and the relevance of these regulatory functions to tumor suppression and
treatment. Energy stress depletes ATP and induces cell death. Surprisingly, our recent study revealed that
energy stress can potently suppress ferroptotic cell death through activating AMPK. Cancer cells with high basal
AMPK activation are resistant to ferroptosis, and AMPK inactivation sensitizes such cancer cells to ferroptosis.
Our recent publication and new preliminary data support the central hypothesis that AMPK inhibits ferroptosis
through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and biosynthesis of polyunsaturated
fatty acid (PUFA) as well as other unidentified downstream effectors. AMPK can have either tumor-suppressive
or -promoting functions, depending on the context. We further hypothesize that AMPK’s tumor-promoting
function is at least partly mediated by its inhibition of ferroptosis, and combining AMPK inhibitors and ferroptosis
inducers (FINs) is a novel therapeutic strategy for treating AMPK-dependent cancers. To test our hypotheses,
we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To study the mechanisms by which AMPK inhibits
ferroptosis in cancer cells. Specific Aim 2: To determine the relevance of ferroptosis to AMPK-mediated tumor
development and treatment. It is expected that our proposed studies will clarify how AMPK regulates PUFA
biosynthesis, identify novel regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis pathways, and reveal a previously
unrecognized function of ferroptosis suppression in AMPK-mediated tumor promotion in cancer. Our proposal is
highly innovative because it focuses on a previously unexplored pathway linking AMPK regulation of ferroptosis
to tumor development. Our proposed studies will have significant impact on both our basic understanding of
ferroptosis and our ability to target AMPK or ferroptosis in cancer treatment."
10737637,"Recombinant cytokines are used in the clinic to treat both chronic autoimmune diseases such as multiple
sclerosis and malignancies such as metastatic melanoma, for the purpose of either suppressing autoimmunity
or activating tumor immunity. Their considerable success in ameliorating established disease, measured by
decreased clinical symptoms of autoimmunity and prolonged progression free survival of cancer patients,
support the clinical importance of cytokine therapies, particularly in comparison to broadly immunosuppressive
or immunostimulatory drug regimens. Yet, additional improvements are needed because in both clinical
settings, cytokine-based therapies suffer from two major challenges, a) tendency of cytokines to induce
pleiotropic effects through multiple target cells, which can result in severe toxicities, and b) short cytokine half-
lives, which require frequent administration or high doses. We propose to address both issues by disulfide
crosslinking cytokines of interest with different surfaces of HSA. We hypothesize that this approach can be
generalized to small bioactive proteins to yield precision engineered variants with high receptor selectivity, by
virtue of HSA-mediated steric blocking, with extended circulation half-life, by virtue of the fusions’ increased
size and potential for neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling, and with ease in manufacturing and purification of
a single molecular entity. In this application, we specifically chose IL-2 as the prototypic cytokine for HSA-
disulfide design due to its central role in regulating and activating immune responses through differential
binding to trimeric and dimeric IL-2 receptors expressed on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD8 cytotoxic cells
(CTLs). Treg cells constitutively express all three components of the high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R), which
renders them sensitive to relatively low concentrations of IL-23. In contrast, CTLs and natural killer (NK) cells
only transiently express the high affinity IL-2R during activation, but more generally express the medium affinity
receptor comprised of just IL-2Rβ and γc (IL-2Rβγ). For this reason, high doses of IL-2 are required to activate
CTL for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer (mRC) and metastatic melanoma (MM). Low IL-2 doses target
Treg and are being explored for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes (T1D) and
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although current dose differentiated regimens of native IL-2 have shown
some promise, the intrinsic overlapping activity toward both CTLs and Treg cells has thus far proved a serious
barrier to effective IL-2 immunotherapy. Moreover, as a small 133 amino acid residue protein, native IL-2 is
cleared from circulation quickly, requiring continuous infusion to maintain efficacious blood concentrations. To
address these critical limitations of IL-2, both its receptor specificity and pharmacokinetics (PK) must be
optimized. To achieve these goals, we propose to engineer disulfide cross-linked HSA-cc-IL2 complexes that
preferentially activate 1) effector T cells to promote their tumor immunity and 2) regulatory T cells to promote
suppression of inflammatory diseases."
10745318,"Supported employment is an evidence-based practice that places individuals with serious mental illness
into competitive employment. Employment specialists are embedded into mental health teams and work with
individuals to identify employment consistent with their interests and personal goals. Supported employment
programs consistently have been found to be effective at job placement. However, maintenance of
employment continues to be a significant challenge for individuals living with a serious mental illness.
Interpersonal difficulties often contribute to job terminations. Individuals with a serious mental illness often
have difficulty with interpreting emotional expressions, perspective taking, and social problem-solving. Thus, in
addition to assistance with job placement, individuals living with a serious mental illness are also likely to
benefit from intervention focused on developing skills to manage the social demands of work. An existing,
evidence-based, psychosocial skills intervention, Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT), will be
adapted for use in this study. SCIT targets emotion recognition, perspective taking, and social problem-solving
skills. The curriculum will be tailored to work settings and to Veterans with serious mental illness. Then, a pilot
study will be conducted to assess the acceptability of integrating this psychosocial skills training with supported
employment and the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial in the future.
 To accomplish the first objective, structured stakeholder interviews will be conducted with Veterans who
have participated previously in supported employment (n = 20) and employment specialists at the VA (n = 5) to
identify educational topics and work examples to incorporate into SCIT. The curriculum will be piloted to elicit
feedback on the session content and flow. Then, to assess acceptability and feasibility, an open trial pilot
study will be conducted with 20 Veterans with serious mental illness who are enrolled in the supported
employment program at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. Upon study enrollment, participants will
attend one 2-hour skills training session weekly for 13 weeks. Group size will be limited to 4-6 participants. To
promote generalization of skills training, assignments will be given weekly to prompt participants to use skills
outside of group. After completion of skills training, participants will continue to meet with their employment
specialist. Materials will be developed for the employment specialists to use in session to prompt participants
to continue to use skills at work. Participants will complete baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up
assessments so that social functioning, relationship quality, work performance, self-efficacy, quality of life, and
symptom severity can be measured. In addition, participants and employments specialists will complete an
individual, semi-structured, qualitative exit interview that will (1) assess attitudes about the intervention
components, structure, and materials; (2) elicit suggestions for intervention improvement; and (3) ask
participants for their observations about the impact of the program on intervention targets.
 Acceptability will be assessed quantitatively as: 1) uptake (percentage of Veterans who participate); 2)
engagement (number of sessions attended); and 3) participant ratings of interest, value, and satisfaction.
Specifically, we predict: a study uptake rate of 50%; 70% session completion; and positive endorsement on
measures of interest, value, and satisfaction. Acceptability also will be measured through qualitative analysis
of participant and employment specialist exit interviews. Feasibility will be measured by: participant
enrollment; retention in skills training and supported employment at 3- and 6-months post-enrollment;
treatment fidelity; and completeness of data collection at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up
assessments. Main indicators of feasibility will be: enrollment of 3 participants per a month; 75% and 60%
participant retention at 3- and 6-months, respectively; 90% consistency with study interventions; and 85% of
data points completed."
10788294,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The school is a key setting for the delivery of mental health services to children. School-wide positive behavior
interventions and supports (PBIS), a service delivery strategy based on the public health model, is a useful
vehicle for implementing mental health EBPs. In PBIS, schools implement universal (Tier 1) interventions to
improve school climate and safety, and can employ targeted (Tier 2) group interventions for children with or at
risk for mental health disorders. Very little research has been conducted on using mental health EBPs at Tier
2. Adequate and ongoing training opportunities are frequently identified as “essential practices” needed to
successfully sustain the benefits of interventions. School personnel, with or without prior mental health training,
can implement Tier 2 interventions with fidelity and clinical effectiveness when provided adequate support.
School mental health programs that successfully implement targeted group interventions often use ongoing
supervision from internal supervisors. A number of studies have shown that more experienced school
personnel can successfully be trained to serve as coaches and supervisors for those implementing EBPs. In
order for these schools to receive the potential public mental health benefits of targeted mental health
interventions in schools, an efficient, scalable, cost-effective and sustainable model of training and consultation
that can be transferred from experts to school coaches and from coaches to EBP implementers is needed.
Little is known about which models of support for sustainment are effective, feasible, and cost-effective.
The aims of the study are (a) to compare fidelity, cost-effectiveness, and student outcomes of Tier 2 mental
health interventions across 2 sustainment conditions, (b) assess mediators and moderators of consultation
support on implementation fidelity, and (c) assess perceived feasibility and acceptability of consultation
support.
The study proposes to use a 2-arm, randomized controlled trial, Type 2 Hybrid cluster randomized design.
Sixty school personnel from 12 schools will receive full initial implementation support for 1 year and then will be
randomly assigned to receive one of 2 sustainment conditions: (a) remote consultation provided by school
district coaches who themselves will be receiving remote support from expert external consultants
(Sustainment 1 [S1]); and (b) consultation as usual provided by district coaches with no external support
(Sustainment 2 [S2]). S1 will have a period of diminished support followed by a period of no support. The
interventions to be implemented by school personnel are EBPs for the most common externalizing and
internalizing mental health disorders. Our guiding framework is the Interactive Systems Framework (ISF) for
dissemination and implementation research. The results of the proposed study will provide a scalable and cost-
effective strategy for the sustainment of PBIS mental health supports in under-resourced schools."

Glioblastoma (GBM) prognosis remains dismal with a median survival of 16-18 months despite the use of
multimodality treatment. Immunotherapy attempts have been unsuccessful in GBM treatment, including
negative phase III trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines. Based on strong preclinical data, we
hypothesize that we can develop an effective immunotherapy approach against GBM by employing an
immunostimulatory measles virus strain (MV-s-NAP) expressing the Helicobacter Pylori neutrophil-activating
protein (NAP), a toll-like receptor 2 agonist. We also hypothesize that MV-s-NAP induced changes in the tumor
microenvironment, resulting from immunogenic cell death, can increase efficacy and lead in synergy when
combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We propose to further enhance the efficacy of this approach by
blocking the inhibitory effect of IDO upregulation. We also propose to optimize viral replication in glioblastoma
by blocking the interferon response pathway, a known mechanism of mammalian cell resistance to oncolytic
viruses, with JAK inhibitors. This project has three specific aims: In specific aim 1, we plan to evaluate the
efficacy, optimal sequence and mechanism of action of MV-s-NAP virotherapy in conjunction with antibody
blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and IDO inhibitors in immunocompetent GBM models, including GL261,
CT2A, as well as genetically engineered models of spontaneous gliomagenesis. In specific aim 2 we will
evaluate the impact of modulating expression of interferon stimulated genes on the efficacy of MV-s-NAP
virotherapy and immunovirotherapy by inhibiting the interferon response pathway, which has been shown to
decrease viral permissiveness and replication. In specific aim 3 we will test the safety of the optimal efficacy
approach identified in specific aims 1 and 2 by conducting toxicology and biodistribution studies in measles
replication permissive Ifnarko CD46 Ge mice (an FDA approved model of measles virus replication) in order to
determine the safe dose of the combination prior to clinical translation. Safety of the recommended human
dose will be further confirmed in a second primate (Rhesus macaques) model. Overall, this work will introduce
an innovative multipronged immunovirotherapy approach in the treatment of glioblastoma that has the potential
to overcome the lack of efficacy observed with other strategies."
10760233,"Serine integrases carry out recombination between short, specific DNA sequences commonly referred to as
attP and attB to integrate a viral genome into the chromosome of a host. The reaction does not require
accessory proteins, additional DNA elements, or other cofactors and is effectively irreversible in the absence of
a viral recombination directionality factor (RDF) protein. These features have led to the emergence of serine
integrases as important tools in genome engineering and synthetic biology applications. As bacteriophage
integrases, the serine integrases have a strong influence over microbial communities, including the human gut
microbiota, where the resident phage population is thought to influence human health. Serine integrases are
also responsible for the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes within bacterial communities. Despite
their importance in human health and their widespread use in biomedical research, our mechanistic
understanding of how serine integrases function is still primitive. To address the largest gaps in our
understanding of serine integrase structure and function, we will determine the first structure of an integrase-
attachment site structure, establish the structural basis for RDF function, and test the hypothesis that serine
integrase efficiency in mammalian cells is limited by the strength of attP and attB site association. Our
experimental approaches include a novel kinetic analysis of the integration reaction, structure determination of
reaction intermediates using X-ray diffraction, analytical ultracentrifugation, novel integration and excision
assays, and integration into chromosomal sites in human cells. Our functional model for serine integrase
regulation of site-specificity, directionality, and site-association using interactions between coiled-coil domains
is unprecedented among nucleic acid enzymes. These studies will provide an important framework for
engineering improved function in serine integrase applications and may lead directly to improved integrases for
targeted integration in mammalian cells."
10767801,"Abstract:
Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) light creates DNA damage that induces high levels of somatic mutations in
human skin cancers like melanoma. UV light most commonly causes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)
and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) at dipyrimidine sequences (i.e., TT, TC, CT, and CC). Deamination of
cytidines in these lesions or mutagenic bypass leads to their frequent conversion to mutations. As a result, UV-
exposed cells and skin cancers are dominated by C to T and CC to TT substitutions in dipyrimidine sequences
that collectively constitute a UV mutation signature. Surprisingly, many driver mutations that contribute to
melanoma progression have sequence context and substitution characteristics that do not conform to the
canonical UV mutation signature. For example, the most common melanoma driver mutation, BRAF V600E,
involves a T to A substitution in a GTG sequence context. This difference in mutation characteristics between
most UV-induced mutations and melanoma driver mutations has led to the hypothesis that UV light induces
melanomagenesis by mechanisms other than the induction of mutations. However, we have recently provided
experimental evidence of mutations caused by rare, non-canonical UV lesions in whole genome sequenced
yeast and bioinformatics evidence of similar lesions in human clinical skin cancers. These lesions are likely
bulky photoproducts formed at TA, CA, and AC dinucleotides. Strikingly, the mutations associated with these
atypical UV photoproducts have identical characteristics to many recurrent driver mutations in melanoma,
suggesting that these rare lesions may play a significant role in causing skin cancer. The objective of this
proposal is to better define the characteristics of atypical UV photoproducts and their contribution to cancer
progression. In Aim I, we will utilize CPD and 6-4PP photolyases expressed in yeast to assign UV-induced
mutation classes to their corresponding lesion types as well as assess the ability of physiological UVB light to
induce mutation classes associated with atypical UV photoproducts in yeast and human cells. In Aim II, we will
analyze the genome-wide distribution of atypical TA photoproducts using a novel high throughput sequencing
method, called UVDE-seq. We will also characterize the formation of putative CA and AC photoproducts and
their contribution to oncogenic BRAF mutations. Finally, Aim III will identify DNA polymerases involved in the
error-free and error-prone bypass of TA and AC photoproducts. Successful completion of these aims will
provide new insights into the molecular causes of skin cancer, and thereby define a new paradigm of UV
mutagenesis that could potentially explain the epidemiological association of acute UV exposure with
increased melanoma incidence."

Rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) among young adults have reached a crisis level, especially for
those in the LGBTQ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning and/or transgender) population, who face
social stigma in addition to the typical developmental challenges. Although we know the general risk factors for
suicide, those have limited utility in predicting how, when, and in whom suicide occurs. It is critically
important to consider the role of social context because STB often occurs in response to a recent social threat
event such as rejection and could be more likely in those who have altered sensitivity of neural social circuitry.
The proposed R01 study in response to RFA MH-20-327 builds on social models such as Minority Stress
Theory and the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and examines social risk factors of STB from distal to proximal
levels. The overarching goal is to predict change in STB, including cumulative intensity of STB and transition
from suicidal thoughts to behaviors, on a time scale from hours to days to months. We propose that in LGBTQ
young adults, STB occurs through social processing and regulation of socially generated negative affect (e.g.,
shame). Specifically, we examine the distal vulnerability factors of sensitivity in social brain circuitry and
negative urgency, or the tendency toward impulsive behavior in the face of painful negative affect, and the
proximal, time-varying factors of sleep dysregulation and social experiences (e.g., rejection). The study will test
the association of these distal and proximal factors with STB; differences in these factors between LGBTQ
young adults with vs. without STB; the interplay of distal and proximal factors; and the role of LGBTQ-related
characteristics (e.g., victimization, outness) in STB.
The study will include 130 participants age 18-30, all of whom identify as LGBTQ and 2/3 of whom have
recurrent suicidal ideation and lifetime history of suicidal behavior. Participants will complete a detailed
interview of STB, an fMRI scan using social threat paradigms, a 3-month protocol of actigraphy and
smartphone-based assessment, and a follow-up interview at 6 months. Smartphone data will include ecological
momentary assessment of social threat experiences and STB, as well as passively collected sensor data (e.g.,
social media app use, texting activity). Traditional and machine learning quantitative techniques will be
applied to determine contributions of distal and proximal factors to STB (e.g., occurrence of suicidal behavior),
individual differences in risk factors, and contributions of neural, sleep, social, clinical, and demographic
factors to STB. The study will elucidate the role of modifiable risk factors in STB and have relevance to clinical
neuroscience, suicidology, and prevention efforts."
10758239,"Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a life-threatening, neurodegenerative disease that causes the
degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. There are currently neither a cure nor effective
treatments to slow progression. However, recent new genetic, biochemical and biophysical evidence implicates
stress granules as crucibles for disease development. Stress granules are membraneless organelles, also called
biomolecular condensates, which form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of RNA-binding proteins and
RNA. Mutations in RNA-binding proteins convert liquid-like stress granules into solid inclusions. Prolonged stress
granule assembly can result in similar effects. These observations point to new opportunities for therapeutic
interventions if key open questions regarding the nature of liquid vs. solid assemblies can be answered. We will
thus test the overarching hypothesis, which is based on above observations, that mutations in RNA-binding
proteins change the driving forces for phase separation, the dynamical arrest of the liquid condensates and the
ability of the condensates to promote the formation of protein fibrils. Our proposed studies will thus focus on the
physics of phase separation of RNA-binding proteins, specifically on their intrinsically disordered low-complexity
domains (LCDs) that are sufficient for mediating phase separation and are the typical locations of disease
mutations. We will use the LCD of hnRNPA1 as an archetypal member of the class of ALS-associated RNA-
binding proteins and will extend our studies also to the LCD of FUS. Mittag and Pappu have recently developed
a stickers-and-spacers model that is based on the identification of transient, cohesive interactions amongst
aromatic amino acid residues as providing the main driving force for phase separation. The aromatic residues
are the stickers in this model, the spacers are the residues that connect the stickers. The model enables the
quantitative prediction of full coexistence curves as a function of temperature and, importantly, resulted in a
conceptual advancement of our understanding of how phase separation is encoded in LCDs. The complimentary
expertise of Mittag and Pappu will now bring to bear a combination of biophysical experiments, computation and
theory on the following three specific aims: (1) To extend the stickers-and-spacers model by quantifying the
interplay among different types of stickers and spacers. (2) To test the hypothesis that disease causing mutations
within LCDs of ALS-causing RNA-binding proteins cause dynamically arrested phase transitions. (3) To uncover
the interplay among sidechain and backbone interactions and their contributions to spatial organization of LCDs
within dense phases. Our results will enable quantitative predictions of the effects of ALS-associated mutants
on phase behavior. We will obtain a clear understanding of how sequence-specific phase diagrams contribute
to the dynamics of phase separation and aging phenomena. We will identify the types of interactions underlying
liquid-like and solid-like dense phases. These results will have a direct bearing on therapeutic interventions
against the functional disruptions that are likely to be caused by dynamically arrested phase separation."

Phages are viruses that infect bacteria, and are the most abundant type of organism on earth. In
addition, phages are a potential antibacterial therapy. The overall focus of the project is phage-
inspired engineering for antibacterial applications and fundamental evolutionary studies. The
first goal is to develop phage-based nanomaterials for technologies targeting bacteria. We have
previously engineered synthetic phages to deliver colloidal gold, which creates intense heat
when exposed to light. These targeted nanomaterials may be effective for treating bacterial
infections. However, engineering them to target a specific bacterial pathogen is an important
challenge that is addressed in this proposal. Second, phages are an excellent platform for
evolutionary studies, as peptides displayed on their surfaces can exhibit various functions.
Based on our previous experience with mapping fitness landscapes, we propose systematic
studies to map the complete fitness landscape of phage-displayed peptides and probe their
evolvability. Third, to improve efficacy and overcome problems with immunogenicity of phages,
we propose encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles as an alternative approach for carrying and
delivering colloidal gold to a target. Our approaches combine emerging synthetic technologies,
growing metagenomic databases, and advances in empirical studies of evolution."
10767808,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The majority of drugs in the extant pharmacopeia are small molecules. Half of those small molecules act
on extracellular targets, and half act on intracellular targets. A minority of drugs are proteins, and
virtually all of those proteins are antibodies, hormones, or enzymes that act on extracellular targets. The
proposed research program will endow proteins with the ability to enter cells and act on intracellular
targets. The program takes advantage of new chemical reactivity that uses tuned diazo compounds to
esterify protein carboxyl groups in water. The resulting esterified proteins are analogous to small-
molecule prodrugs in enabling traversal of the plasma membrane of human cells. Ester hydrolysis
catalyzed by intracellular esterases makes the modifications traceless, avoiding any compromise to proper
function. “Protein esterification” has an uncharted landscape. Accordingly, the work will begin by
exploring fundamental attributes of esterified proteins, including their mechanism of cellular uptake and
the enzymology of ester hydrolysis by cellular esterases. Specific systems will be enlisted to assess the
generality of this delivery method and provide opportunities for discovery. In particular, esterification
will be used to deliver particular proteins that elicit cytotoxicity or tumor suppression, or control genome
editing. The delivery strategy will also be used to anchor oligonucleotides and other beneficial moieties
on the cell surface and generalize the selective degradation of cellular proteins. These broad and far-
reaching efforts will provide high-impact advances in biomedicine, chemical biology, and allied fields."
10761727,"Project Summary
With advancements in operative techniques and perioperative management, there is an increasing number of
patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease (SV) that are surviving into childhood and beyond. Due
to the chronic pressure and volume load placed on the single systemic ventricle, these patients remain at
constant risk for the development and progression of cardiac failure. Unfortunately, very little is known about
how the failing SV heart differs from the failing pediatric or adult biventricular heart. Additionally, the transition
to heart failure that occurs in the SV heart is also incompletely understood. This lack of understanding in the
mechanisms underlying SV heart failure are a major hurdle in the identification of effective targeted therapies.
In addition, the rarity of SV makes it very difficult to perform prospective controlled drug studies as is routinely
done in the adult heart failure population and as a result, treatments are based on extrapolation of clinical trials
from different patient populations, anectdotal experience, or potential for theoretic perceived benefit.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i), such as sildenafil, are an example of such a therapy that is
increasingly used in the SV patient population with a limited existing evidence-basis. Widespread, and fairly
indiscriminate use of PDE5i for SV patients is driven in part by several publications suggesting positive clinical
results in small series of SV patients. The recently published NHLBI FUEL (Fontan Udenafil Exercise
Longitudinal assessment) trial demonstrated improved submaximal exercise in 400 fontan patients. These
encouraging studies combined with our recent publication demonstrating increased PDE5 expression and
activity in failing SV hearts suggesting that the myocardium may be a viable target of PDE5i.
While historically the rationale for the use of PDE5i in SV is to augment pulmonary blood flow, we hypothesize
that the failing SV myocardium, and specifically the mitochondria, represent a target of PDE5i therapy as well.
Our preliminary data demonstrate: (1) Mitochondrial dysfunction, altered sirtuin signaling, and increased
mitochondrial protein acetylation in failing SV myocardium (SVHF); (2) Decreased mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation detected by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) in failing SV hearts
treated ex vivo with PDE5i; (3) Decreased protein acetylation and improvement in mitochondrial function in
failing SV hearts treated ex vivo with PDE5i; (4) Impaired mitochondria function in SV Non-Failing (SVNF)
(primary transplant or Norwood specimens) hearts treated ex vivo with PDE5i; and (5) Mitochondrial
dysfunction and increased ROS in primary cardiomyocytes treated with SVHF patient serum, which is
improved by the addition of PDE5i or the SIRT 3 activator, honokiol (HNK). We hypothesize that mitochondrial
dysfunction is involved in the HF transition of SV hearts, and that PDE5i improves mitochondrial function in
failing SV hearts in a sirtuin-dependent manner. We propose the use of human tissue and a cardiomyocyte
model to complete the proposed experiments. The purpose of this project is to understand the transition to HF
in the SV population and provide pre-clinical evidence to inform more targeted use of, with the goal of
optimizing clinical care and improving outcomes."
10837847,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by the expansion and
accumulation of immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Advances in the AML genetics
have led to a better understanding of disease progression, paving the way for the development of novel targeted
therapies. Still, the mainstay of AML treatment is chemotherapy, which has remained mostly unchanged for
several decades, and fewer than one-third of adult AML patients experience a durable remission. Reduced-
intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for AML is potentially curative, but relapse rates exceed
50%. We have shown that allogeneic natural killer (NK) cell infusions after high-dose lymphodepletion (LD) can
induce remission in 30-40% of patients with relapsed/refractory AML. However, this approach is limited by the
toxicity of high-dose LD, NK cell numbers within haploidentical blood products, inadequate donor NK cell
persistence, lack of NK cell antigen specificity, allogeneic rejection and challenges of exporting adoptive NK cell
therapy beyond specialty centers. To overcome these barriers, we have developed a scalable GMP-compliant
platform for the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into highly potent NK cells (termed iNK).
With our system, we can generate stable gene-edited lines for tailored approaches to NK cell immunotherapy.
In the past year, we have safely treated patients with up to 6 cryopreserved doses of off-the-shelf iNK cell
products. In this project we will test the central hypothesis that triple gene-modified iNK cells (FT538) represent
a novel and effective immunotherapy for the treatment of AML. FT538 is a cell product with three functional
modifications: a high affinity, non-cleavable CD16 Fc receptor to augment antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity; a membrane-bound IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion molecule (IL-15RF) that acts intrinsically to enhance
NK cell activity; and knockout of CD38 to mitigate NK cell fratricide in the presence of the anti-CD38 monoclonal
antibody, daratumumab. The central hypothesis will be tested in three independent aims. In Aim 1, we will test
the hypothesis that FT538 iNK cells will exhibit sustained persistence and function after adoptive transfer for
targeting of CD38+ AML cells when combined with daratumumab in an FDA-approved and enrolling phase I
clinical trial. Because CD38 is highly expressed on AML, immune suppressor cells, and activated CD8+ T cells,
our clinical trial will test whether daratumumab dosing before FT538 iNK cell treatment enhances the persistence
of iNK through selective immunodepletion. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that iNK cell specificity, potency,
and persistence can be enhanced by optimizing IL-15 signaling in the context of CD38 knockout and that a novel
anti-CD5-ADC will provide effective and safer LD to enhance persistence. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that dual antigen-specific targeting through a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and CD16 (with Tri-specific Killer
Engagers [TriKEs]) will further increase efficacy of the iNK cell product against AML. Approaches to maximize
persistence without exhaustion and antigen targeting will synergize with Projects 1 and 2."
10837853,"The broad objective of the Administrative and Clinical Research Support Core is to provide essential
administrative and clinical research support for the Projects and other Cores fundamental to the success of this
Program Project Grant. The administrative components of the Core focus on accounting, budgeting, regulatory
reporting and, most importantly, fostering team science by providing multiple opportunities for communication
between project and core investigators, external collaborators and the External Advisory Board members. Core
A will also facilitate clinical trial activation and execution and protocol specific training for the faculty and
research staff as well as nurse coordinators and advance practice providers working in the inpatient and
outpatient clinical units to maximize trial safety and integrity. To accomplish our objective, there are 4 specific
aims: Aim 1: Scientific Oversight is focused on facilitating communication between investigators in projects
and cores, arranging annual retreats for the Program’s team and annual meetings with an External Advisory
Board, composed of 4 renowned experts in the field of immune effector cellular therapy, and other key leaders
in the field on an ad hoc basis. The Programs’ leaders will continually seek areas of collaboration within and
outside the Program with investigators with expertise. Aim 2: Administrative and Financial Support is focused
on general accounting and fiscal support associated with the grant overall and individual projects and cores,
and assistance in the completion of progress reports. Aim 3: Clinical Oversight and Services is focused on
providing the support staff necessary for the preparation of clinical protocols and applications to regulatory
bodies, maintenance of clinical protocols, regulatory assistance for IND submissions and reporting, and
management of audits by internal and external agencies, and trial monitoring. Core A is also be responsible for
development of data management plans, case report forms and patient study treatment calendars, as well as
the collection of data from each of the clinical units, meeting the data management agreements with our clinical
partner, MHealth-Fairview. Aim 4: Faculty and Staff Education is focused on enhancing staff and faculty
education in the rapidly evolving field of cell, gene and immunotherapy. This will be accomplished through
standing seminars and grand rounds and other clinical program meetings. Here, we bring in outside leaders in
the field to present seminars and meet with senior and junior faculty and trainees, often leading to new
collaborations, magnifying our successes in translational medicine. Aim 5: Enrollment Optimization and
Enhanced Subject Education is novel unique approach for predicting and enhancing patient accrual and
subject understanding in support of the proposed clinical trials. These tools developed by investigators at the
University of Minnesota identify barriers to accrual and subject understanding, permitting interventions prior to
trial initiation. The long-term objective is the rapid and safe translation of allogeneic immune effector cell
therapies in the treatment of cancer that more effectively target and kill tumor cells with fewer adverse effects."
10751002,"Promoting Social Connection to Prevent Late-Life Suicide
Older adults have high rates of suicide and projections indicate subsequent cohorts will usher in even higher
rates. We can expect an increase in suicide deaths among older adults in coming decades. However, there are
no evidence-based interventions to prevent suicide deaths in later life, and scant data support strategies to
prevent suicide deaths at any age. Social disconnection is a promising intervention target for late-life suicide
prevention, but it is not known whether targeting social connection is an effective strategy to prevent suicide in
later life.
The objective of this R61/R33 proposal, in line with NIMH priorities of reducing suicide and understanding
mechanisms, is to test whether a behavioral intervention—Social Engage Coaching (S-ENG)—reduces suicide
risk in later life (clinical outcome) via social connection (target mechanism). We propose a two-phase
experimental therapeutics project with multimodal assessment of objective and subjective indicators of social
connection (via smartphone assessments). The R61 is a single-arm trial of S-ENG (n=30) with 1 week of
smartphone-based target assessment at baseline, 8-weeks, and 16-weeks. The R33 is an RCT (S-ENG vs.
eCAU; n=120) with longer duration follow-up to test clinical impact (20-weeks). Subjects are lonely older adults
in Senior Living Communities (SLCs) who endorse suicide ideation. Study conditions are S-ENG (10 individual
coaching sessions) and enhanced usual-care in SLCs (eCAU; exposure to SLC milieu with geriatrician medical
directors).
Our first aim for the R61 phase is to test target engagement (social connection). We hypothesize that S-ENG
will be associated with increases in four indices of social connection. Our go/no-go criteria will determine if we
move to the R33 phase: At least two indices of social connection must evidence clinically meaningful
improvement—one objective and one subjective. If go/no-go criteria are met, we will address two aims for the
R33 phase. First, to confirm target engagement in a randomized trial. We hypothesize that S-ENG (vs. eCAU)
will be associated with greater increases in social connection. Second, to examine clinical and functional
indices of reduced suicide risk. We hypothesize that S-ENG (vs. eCAU) will be associated with greater
improvement in suicide ideation and quality of life at 20-week follow-up and improvement in social connection
at 16-weeks will be associated with reduction in indices of suicide risk.
A confirmatory efficacy trial will follow this study. Promoting social connection to prevent suicide is an under-
studied but promising strategy to address mental health and well-being in later life."
10791761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The centriole is a conserved organelle of metazoans that is found at the core of microtubule
organizing centers, centrosomes, and at the base of cilia and flagellae. Centriole dysfunction leads to a
wide range of diseases including the developmental defects of ciliopathies; defective brain development
in microcephaly; and in cancer where supernumerary or defective centrosomes are associated with
poor prognosis. Centriole duplication is promoted by Plk4, which phosphorylates cartwheel proteins to
mediate their assembly. We and others have found that induction of Plk4-mediated centriole
amplification results in hyperplasia of several tissues and increases the susceptibility to tumorigenesis
in the mouse in the absence of the p53 tumor suppressor.
 Both the loss and acquisition of extra centrosomes normally block cell proliferation. However, the
pathway that responds to loss of centrosomes differs from several pathways that respond to
supernumerary centrosomes. Therefore, to identify proteins that signal or respond to the presence of
extra centrosomes, we carried out a genome-wide screen for genes that when deleted or knocked-
down permit the proliferation of cells that have elevated levels of Plk4. This has identified new
pathways whereby cells respond to supernumerary centrosomes: a previously unknown involvement of
specific Rac-mediated signaling that regulates centriole duplication; proteins that regulate the
elongation, disengagement and separation of centrioles; and negative regulators of ciliogenesis.
 Here we follow three approaches to understand how centriole number is regulated in proliferating
cells. First, we will determine how the Arh15gap GTPase Activating Protein acts upon the Pak1/2
protein kinases to regulate Plk4 levels or activity and upon Arp2/3 to regulate spindle associated actin
to permit an increase in centriole- and cell-cycle arrest. Second, we examine how known components
of the centriole affect the execution of the centriole and cell cycles at unexpected points. We will
determine how the Usp33 deubiquitinase regulates the centriole capping protein complex to protect the
nascent procentriole and how proteins required in the centriole cycle for both centriole disengagement
and centrosome separation contribute to the block to cell proliferation in the presence of supernumerary
centrosomes. Finally, we will explore how negative regulators of ciliogenesis block primary cilium
formation in the presence of extra centrioles in such a way as to arrest cell proliferation.
 We anticipate that this research will advance our understanding of the multiple ways in which cells
respond to supernumerary centrosomes. It will identify pathways that can be targeted for restoring
centriole numbers or cell cycle regulation in tumor cells or for targeting such cells for apoptosis. This
will find translational application in developing multiple drug strategies for cancer treatment."

10872773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. 90% of patients with SLE are women
between the ages of 15 and 44. SLE is characterized by a hyperactive, dysfunctional immune system, the
presence of autoantibodies, and widespread inflammation in multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints,
heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. In SLE, dysregulated plasma cells, a terminally differentiated subset of B cells,
produce autoantibodies which attack DNA, RNA, and self-proteins, including histones. SLE is currently managed
with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive approaches including pan B-cell depleting regimens that
alleviate symptoms and slow tissue damage. However, sustained remission of SLE remains a clinical challenge
for several reasons. First, many therapies cause significant side effects as they globally affect the immune
system. Second, there is a lack of targeted therapies that simultaneously eradicate autoantibody-producing
short-lived plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), as well as their B-cell precursors. To eradicate
all pathogenic B-cell subsets concurrently and specifically in patients with SLE, we propose to determine whether
a patented, non-toxic splice-modulating oligomer (SMO), that prevents synthesis of the long isoform of the
prolactin receptor (LFPRLR), is a viable approach. Increased circulating levels of the hormone, prolactin (PRL),
are known to be associated with the exacerbation of symptoms of adult and pediatric SLE. Consistent with this,
our preliminary findings suggest abnormally elevated expression of PRLRs in immune cells of female mice and
patients with SLE. However, whether PRL and its receptors are causal in immunomodulation in SLE is less
understood. Recently, we and others published that the LFPRLR specifically promotes the retention of potentially
autoreactive B cells in a mouse model of SLE. We found that knockdown of the LFPRLR reduces the numbers
of short-lived plasmablasts and LLPCs and their B-cell precursors in female SLE-prone mice. How the LFPRLR
maintains pathogenic plasma cells and their precursor B cells in SLE remains to be delineated. This forms the
focus of our current R21. We propose two Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of LFPRLR knockdown
on pathogenic B-cell subsets including their terminally differentiated derivatives, plasma cells, in murine SLE. In
Aim 2, we will determine the ability of LFPRLR knockdown to reduce pathologic plasma cells in human SLE. In
both Aims, we will employ complimentary high-dimensional single-cell immune profiling approaches. We will
correlate these findings with measurements of standard indicators of autoimmune disease pathology in SLE-
prone mice and in samples from patients with SLE. Our studies will solidify knockdown of the LFPRLR as a
novel, effective, non-toxic, and isoform-specific strategy to eradicate abnormal autoantibody-producing plasma
cells in patients with SLE. In the long-term, these studies will propel extensive preclinical and clinical
development of agents that knockdown the LFPRLR, such as those used here, to sustain disease remission in
girls and women with SLE."
10773173,"ABSTRACT
Given its strong association with breast cancer, mammographic density has been proposed as a surrogate
endpoint for breast cancer. We have previously conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
mammographic density phenotypes and identified multiple genetic loci that are shared between mammographic
density and breast cancer. Indeed, as a continuous, precise and highly heritable (~60%) outcome,
mammographic density has proven a powerful tool for identifying genetic risk factors for breast cancer.
 We propose a suite of genetic association studies aiming to increase our understanding of genetic and
environmental predictors of mammographic density and thereby breast cancer. Specifically, we will expand our
previous work to three novel areas including (1) leveraging germline genetic and tissue-specific gene expression
data to identify novel loci associated with mammographic density, (2) the first genome-wide gene-environment
(GE) interaction studies of mammographic density and (3) the first Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies of
mammographic density. First, we will expand our knowledge of the genetic architecture of mammographic
density by conducting the largest GWAS and the first transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of
mammographic density in 33,000 women of European ancestry. To account for the cellular heterogeneity in
breast tissue, we will conduct cell type-specific TWAS. Second, we will identify genetic variants and genes
whose expression interact with established environmental risk factors to alter mammographic density by
conducting the first genome-wide SNP GE interaction and TWASxE studies in 25,000 women of European
ancestry. Third, we will conduct MR analysis for biomarkers proposed to influence mammographic density
including circulating hormones (SHBG, testosterone and estradiol) and CRP. We will leverage newly released
biomarker data from UK Biobank which has led to the identification of hundreds of genetic variants associated
with the biomarkers proposed here, allowing us to generate strong genetic instruments for MR analysis.
 Our application is in response to PA-17-239: “Secondary Analysis and Integration of Existing Data to
Elucidate the Genetic Architecture of Cancer Risk and Related Outcomes”. We will capitalize on data from the
MODE consortium, which has assembled GWAS and mammographic density data on more than 33,000 women
of European ancestry and environmental risk factor data for a subset of 25,000 women. Throughout the proposed
work, we will build on our previous observation that mammographic density can serve as a powerful proxy for
breast cancer, and follow up our findings in BCAC, a large-scale collaboration with more than 120,000 breast
cancer cases. Completion of our aims will lead to identification of novel risk factors for mammographic density
and breast cancer, and shed light on mechanisms by which mammographic density increases breast cancer
risk. Identifying and characterizing genes associated with high breast density and breast cancer could
lead to prevention strategies that specifically target breast density reductions in the population."
10788455,"There is an urgent need to develop new antimicrobial strategies to combat the increasing occurrence of drug resistance in clinical pathogens. Current antibiotics act on a limited set of cellular processes, and the rate of new inhibitor discovery is rapidly declining. With the diminishing arsenal of useful antibiotics, other essential cellular processes must be explored as antibacterial targets. During infection, bacterial pathogens rapidly respond to changes in the host microenvironment by remodeling metabolism to promote growth. These “metabolic adaptations” are crucial for pathogen survival and pathogenicity in vivo and are thus a promising target space for antibiotic development. Positioned at a metabolic branch point to supply essential vitamins and isoprenoids, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is poised to be a key player in bacterial metabolic adaptation during infection, thus it is a potential target. We have uncovered several unique features of DXPS structure and mechanism that have guided the development of selective inhibitors that exert antibacterial activity by a mechanism involving DXPS inhibition. Our research will test the hypothesis that inhibition of DXPS will severely hinder pathogen metabolic adaptation in the host and take the next steps to develop antibacterial strategies targeting DXPS in clinical pathogens."

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world,
and is treated solely by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Although highly effective, 15% of
patients still lose vision despite maximal anti-VEGF therapy. Thus, a critical need exists for novel non-VEGF
therapies. The complement pathway is genetically associated with AMD, macrophages express complement
proteins and receptors, and macrophages are found in surgically excised choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
Additionally, choroidal macrophage depletion results in choroidal atrophy, and both global macrophage depletion
and inhibition of classical monocyte-derived macrophages reduce experimental CNV area. Therefore,
macrophages are implicated in human CNV, steady state vascular homeostasis, and pathological choroidal
angiogenesis. However, macrophages are known to be highly heterogeneous cells that can perform many
diverse functions. Therefore, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on wildtype and classical monocyte-
depleted mice to investigate macrophage origin, heterogeneity, and function during laser-induced CNV. We
identified that interleukin-7 receptor (IL7R)-expressing macrophages are likely derived from classical monocytes
and display a pro-angiogenic transcriptome. Based upon these data, our central hypothesis is that IL7R+
macrophages are critical pro-angiogenic cells during CNV pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we formulated
the following specific aims:
1) Demonstrate that IL7R+ macrophages are necessary for CNV. In this aim, we will use Il7rCre x Rosa26GFP
 mice to fate map IL7R+ macrophages, Il7rCre x Cx3cr1iDTR mice to deplete IL7R+ macrophages, and
 Cx3cr1CrER x Il7rflox mice to knockout the IL7R. We will test the function of IL7R+ macrophages and the IL7R
 using the laser-induced CNV model.
2) Determine that IL7R+ macrophages are derived from classical monocytes and are sufficient to stimulate CNV.
 In this aim, we will use Ccr2CreER x Rosa26GFP mice to fate map classical monocytes and determine if classical
 monocytes can differentiate into IL7R+ macrophages. Furthermore, we will show that IL7R+ macrophages
 are sufficient to stimulate angiogenesis by isolating IL7R+ macrophages from mouse eyes after laser injury.
 We will then test the ability of IL7R+ vs IL7Rneg macrophages to rescue reduced CNV area in Ccr2-/- mice.
Completion of these aims will determine that IL7R+ macrophages are necessary for CNV, derived from classical
monocytes, and sufficient to stimulate angiogenesis. These data will set the stage for cell-based anti-CNV
therapies. Cell-based therapies, targeting IL7R+ macrophages, have the potential to inhibit multiple pro-
angiogenic pathways simultaneously, rather than inhibiting VEGF alone, and change the paradigm for nAMD
therapy."
10802190,"Project Abstract
Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are a heterogenous group of disorders characterized by
the inability to break down long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria for energy. The primary tissues affected are
liver, heart, and muscle. These disorders are identified at birth through newborn screening programs. Treatment
consists of fasting avoidance and replacing long-chain fats in the diet with medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA).
Despite decades of orally dosing patients with MCFA-containing oils, it is not understood how MCFA are
metabolized by liver, muscle, and heart. Further, the rigor of the experimental evidence regarding the therapeutic
efficacy of oral MCFA is low. In mouse models of LC-FAOD, oral MCFA do not improve cardiomyopathy or the
capacity for exercise. Human patients likewise still suffer from muscle symptoms and rhabdomyolysis. In the
current proposal it is postulated that there are two major problems with current MCFA-based therapies. First,
muscle and heart are not equipped to metabolize exogenous MCFA. Second, orally-administered MCFA are
nearly completely absorbed by the liver and do distribute to heart and muscle. It is hypothesized that MCFA
therapy can be optimized to treat cardiomyopathy and rhabdomyolysis through the exploration of alternative
medium-chain lipid species and alternative routes of delivery. The hypothesis is supported by preliminary data
showing that heart and muscle prefer carnitine conjugates of MCFA (MC-carnitines) over free MCFAs, and a
demonstrated improvement in muscle function of LC-FAOD mice upon subcutaneous injection of an MC-
carnitine. This hypothesis will be fully explored in three Specific Aims: 1) Determine the optimal medium-chain
lipid species for liver, heart and muscle; 2) Determine the bioavailability and biodistribution of orally versus
subcutaneously-administered medium-chain lipids; and 3) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of medium-chain
lipids in LC-FAOD mice. Aim 1 is expected to show that liver prefers free MCFA as substrates, while muscle and
heart prefer MC-carnitines. The differential preference is proposed to be due to the presence of mitochondrial
medium-chain acyl-CoA synthases in liver but not heart or muscle. Aim 2 is expected to demonstrate that
subcutaneous delivery of medium-chain lipids greatly increases bioavailability and subsequent biodistribution to
the periphery. Finally, in Aim 3, pre-clinical testing of LC-FAOD mouse models is expected to document the
therapeutic advantage of the optimized substrates from Aim 1 and the subcutaneous delivery from Aim 2. The
results of this project will lay the groundwork for more personalized, symptom-specific application of MCFA-
based therapies in LC-FAOD patients."
10794286,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A major challenge of targeting metabolism for cancer therapy is pathway redundancy, where multiple
sources of critical nutrients can diminish the effects of metabolic therapies. An example of this can be found in
recent attempts to target the serine synthesis pathway for cancer therapy, where the abundance of serine
available to be taken up from the circulation has hampered the success of inhibitors of serine biosynthesis. This
places a premium on pursuing strategies of limiting pathway redundancy if we wish to successfully target serine
and other critical metabolic pathways for cancer therapy. We have taken the approach of analyzing human tumor
gene expression data to identify scenarios where pathway redundancy is limited due to lineage-dependent gene
expression, thereby creating potential vulnerabilities. Using this approach, we have found that the two major
lineages of breast tumors—luminal and basal—express vastly different levels of PSAT1 (phosphoserine
aminotransferase 1), the gene encoding the second enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway. Luminal breast
cancer cells, which express extremely low levels of PSAT1, are unable to activate the serine synthesis pathway
even when extracellular serine is completely absent. As a result, they are entirely dependent on exogenous
serine for proliferation and survival. This is in contrast to basal breast cancer cells, which are able to synthesize
serine and proliferate in the absence of extracellular serine. Mechanistically, this serine auxotrophy appears to
be due to luminal-specific methylation of the PSAT1 gene. Based on this data, we have developed the hypothesis
that lineage-specific epigenetic silencing of the PSAT1 gene induces serine auxotrophy in luminal breast tumors
and makes them vulnerable to inhibition of serine uptake. In this proposal, we will 1) determine whether luminal
breast tumors are sensitive to dietary serine starvation in vivo, 2) define the mechanism of PSAT1 suppression
in luminal tumors, and 3) identify and characterize serine transporters as potential pharmacological targets of
this vulnerability. While luminal breast cancer patients initially have a favorable prognosis due to the utility of
endocrine therapies, over half of all patients eventually develop resistance to these therapies and undergo
relapse. As a result, over half of all breast cancer fatalities are due to luminal breast cancer, making this an area
of significant unmet clinical need. The experiments described in this proposal have the potential to identify new
therapeutic options for patients with advanced luminal breast cancer."

The Functional Genomics and Microbiome (FGM) Core of the Texas Medical Center Digestive Disease Center
(DDC) supports the DDC’s mission and enhances research programs in the theme of infection and injury
affecting the intestine and liver. This core enhances the Center’s scope in response to DDC user demand and
the center’s commitment to the importance of the microbiome:mammalian interface in gastrointestinal and liver
biology. The FGM Core strives to bring together the microbial and mammalian biology underpinning molecular
mechanisms of digestive diseases. It accomplishes this purpose via multi-omics approaches based on large-
scale data generation and deep analytics of microbial and mammalian cell populations.
The FGM Core is a comprehensive resource with services including consultation on experimental design and
specimen processing, robust data generation and analysis pipelines, bioinformatics strategies, and biostatistical
support. We have created a fully integrated genomic and multi-omic analysis platform for investigators studying
digestive diseases that is highly used by DDC members (25 of 62 Full Member usage, >680 service requests,
and 83 resulting publications during the present funding cycle).
The FGM Core provides DDC members with instrumentation and expertise to facilitate microbial and mammalian
genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and protein analytics applied to gastrointestinal diseases
characterized by infection, injury, or altered metabolic states. DDC members’ research programs are nurtured
by this Core’s ability to bridge microbiome science and mammalian biology and to provide multi-tiered services
at the levels of genes and effectors (proteins and metabolites). This Core uses tools and services, such as highly
parallel nucleic acid sequencing, mass spectrometry-guided metabolomics and proteomics, and supercomputer-
guided bioinformatics and molecular modeling. The FGM Core serves as a platform for gastrointestinal and
hepatic systems biology by enabling studies of mammalian and microbial gene expression profiles, intracellular
signaling pathways, and cell:cell communication channels.
The FGM Core offers highly innovative services that are both institutionally shared and DDC member-exclusive.
The Core leverages for DDC members (at subsidized rates) the capital-intensive resources (chiefly
instrumentation) within the institutional microbiome and mammalian functional genomics facilities to accomplish
its Aims 1 (to elucidate mammalian gene expression and epigenomics in DD) and Aim 2 (to generate functional
insights into microbiome/virome using metagenomic approaches). The liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry-based metabolomic and proteomic services (Aim 3) coupled with advanced bioinformatics (Aim 4)
are exclusively operated for DDC members."
10920367,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Gastrointestinal Experimental Model Systems Core (Biomedical Research
Core)
The Gastrointestinal Experimental Model Systems (GEMS) Core meets the experimental and scientific needs of
the members of the Texas Medical Center (TMC) Digestive Disease Center (DDC), and supports the DDC’s
overall theme and mission.
The GEMS Core is subdivided into two subcore: 1) organoid, and 2) gnotobiotic sub-cores. The Core’s
centralized services support exciting scientific developments, are based on the unique expertise of the Core
leadership, and facilitate the use of cutting-edge model systems by DDC members. The Core maintains and
supplies DDC members with experiment-ready organoid cultures and gnotobiotic rodents. The Core’s
organizational structure reduces cost burden for members, increases efficiency, saves time, and provides quality
control for each project. The overall goal of the GEMS Core is to provide DDC members with state-of-the-art
experimental model systems that are difficult to initiate and maintain in independent labs. There is no similar
facility in the TMC or the region.
The Specific Aims of the GEMS Core are to: 1) generate, maintain, and provide experiment-ready
gastrointestinal tract organoid cultures and specialized growth reagents for membership use; 2) increase the
complexity of organoid models to study infection and injury; 3) produce, house, manipulate, and colonize
gnotobiotic animals per the needs of DDC members; and, 4) establish housing and embryo transfer conditions
to improve the overall efficiency of the gnotobiotic model.
The GEMS Core has extensive interactions with the Study Design and Clinical Research Core, the Tissue
Analysis and Molecular Imaging Core, and the Functional Genomics and Microbiome Core. The GEMS Core will
continue to respond to the needs of DDC members and develop new services to meet them. The Core has been
heavily used by the 103 DDC members this cycle: organoid subcore by at least 31, gnotobiotics by 29 with nearly
3000 service requests resulting in over 80 publications."
10920369,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Study Design and Clinical Research Core (Clinical Core)
The major functions of the Study Design and Clinical Research Core of the Texas Medical Center Digestive
Disease Center (DDC) are to (1) serve clinical and basic science investigators in digestive diseases with
comprehensive study design consultation and support, (2) assist DDC investigators in all aspects of the
acquisition of clinical specimens required for their research in digestive diseases, (3) develop disease-specific
databases and repositories, and support comprehensive data analyses and interpretation of basic, translation,
clinical and epidemiological studies. The Specific Aims of this core are to successfully execute these functions.
Major Core services include: providing study-design and statistical-analysis support; establishing procedures for
data management and database organization to facilitate efficient analyses; assisting DDC investigators in
acquiring clinical specimens needed for their research; assisting and training in compliance, patient
confidentiality and oversight issues, including preparation of IRB requests and preparation of Investigational New
Drug applications; and educating members via meetings and seminars.
Achievements during the current funding period include the expansion of sample and tissue collection and
banking, and the increased number of requests involving epidemiology and health outcomes research, especially
those using electronic databases to capture large amounts of patient information, risk factors, therapies, and
outcomes; these databases include large disease registries and healthcare claims data. The Clinical Core will
continue to support establishment of the organoid biorepository and expand the specimen collection service to
collect tissue from preneoplastic lesions.
We propose new DDC member-exclusive services that include advanced statistical analytical programs, artificial
intelligence and machine learning, and guidance with causal inference modeling. New data management
services have been integrated including REDCap, dashboards, and applications that interface with laboratory
and clinical aspects of the Core. We also anticipate the growth of demand for expertise related to health services
research in digestive diseases from newly recruited investigators and the NIDDK training program in
epidemiology and outcomes of GI diseases. The Clinical Core will also expand the specimen collection service
to collect specimens for assessing exposure to heavy metal; this new protocol is highly sought after by
investigators studying the role of heavy metals exposure in gastrointestinal and hepatic injury and inflammation.
Twenty-two DDC members used the Core during the current funding cycle, accruing more than 13,500 hours of
service. We supported 24 grant applications (30% already funded) and 200 peer-reviewed publications."
10811704,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rapidly evolving substance misuse crises require a diverse workforce of highly trained substance misuse
researchers. National and global solutions demand sustainable pipelines of elite investigators with a
kaleidoscope of backgrounds, perspectives, and talents. Cultural homogeneity among investigators particularly
impedes efforts to resolve challenges impacting underrepresented minority (URM) and disadvantaged
communities, which often suffer harsher consequences from substance misuse epidemics. Despite some
initiatives to promote diversity, certain groups remain grossly underrepresented in the field. Many URM and
disadvantaged students –including women, LGBTQIAP+, individuals from low-income families, first generation
college students, and persons with disabilities –face multidimensional historical and social factors that limits
their access to the early enrichment, rigorous training, effective mentoring, nourishing environments and
financial support necessary to become drug misuse scientists. Many promising students do not obtain research
experience, are not introduced to a research career, and do not pursue a graduate degree. Among those that
do pursue research careers, there is a publication and funding award disparity between traditional students
versus URM, disadvantaged or first-generation college students. These disparities are due in part to training
gaps that occur early in undergraduate matriculation. These gaps have domino effects throughout graduate
school and throughout one’s career to adversely affect employment, tenure qualifications, and other aspects of
academic life. The key to an inclusive, heterogeneous and highly skilled research community is to develop
comprehensive initiatives that recruit, train, and cultivate bourgeoning URM and disadvantaged scholars early
in their education. To enhance diversity in the next generation of substance misuse and addiction scientists,
we propose a comprehensive recruitment and research education program that builds a trans-disciplinary
substance misuse research traineeship for URM or disadvantaged undergraduates. The proposed program is
entitled the University of South Florida Substance Misuse and Addiction Research Traineeship (SMART). The
SMART specific aims are to: [SA1] Recruit gifted URM and disadvantaged undergraduates into SMART; [SA2]
Train students in mixed research methods, scientific writing, grantsmanship, and professional practices; [SA3]
Facilitate a mentored independent research experience; and [SA4] Disseminate research, best practices, and
outcomes. SMART addresses limitations in the extant diversity programs through five pillars: systematic
recruitment into research programs, early enrichment, rigorous training, effective mentoring, and nourishing
environments. SMART specifically addresses NIH NIDA’s missions to enhance the training of a workforce to
meet national and global research needs; encourage individuals from URM backgrounds to pursue careers in
research; advance science on the causes of drug use; improve the prevention and treatment of substance use
disorders; and advance the research on URM who experience disproportionate consequences."
10763892,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastatic melanoma is the cause of over 80% of skin cancer deaths. Previous work in our lab interrogating the
molecular differences between highly and poorly metastatic melanoma cells revealed that expression of the
secreted protein apolipoprotein E (APOE) is repressed in aggressive melanomas through microRNA targeting.
Rescuing APOE expression through genetic and pharmacologic approaches suppresses metastatic phenotypes
and prolongs survival in melanoma animal models. Suppression of the invasion phenotype in particular was
found to be mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), an APOE receptor present on
the melanoma cell surface. However, the mechanisms by which LRP1 cooperates with APOE to facilitate
inhibition of melanoma invasion remain uncharacterized. This proposal seeks to elucidate the molecular
alterations initiated by this APOE-LRP1 interaction that result in loss of melanoma invasive capacity. Based on
literature evidence and preliminary data, I hypothesize that APOE inhibits melanoma invasiveness by activating
an LRP1 signaling axis. This hypothesis will be tested through the following two aims: In Aim 1, I will fully
characterize the functional consequences of LRP1 loss on APOE-mediated metastasis suppression by
developing LRP1 genetic knockouts in melanoma cell lines and performing metastasis assays as well as
transcriptomic analysis. In Aim 2, I will explore the role of LRP1 intracellular signaling as a potential suppressive
mechanism downstream of APOE binding by developing LRP1 signaling mutants in melanoma cell lines and in
a genetic mouse melanoma model. Successful completion of these studies will uncover a novel, therapeutically
targetable signaling pathway that regulates melanoma metastasis and will further our understanding of the
influences of APOE and LRP1 on cancer progression. Training will be completed in the laboratory of Dr. Sohail
Tavazoie and the highly collaborative environments of The Rockefeller University and the Tri-Institutional MD-
PhD Program, and will be centered on my goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."
10795887,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
High-risk resectable melanoma patients (MPs) with clinically detectable stage III with or without in-transit
metastases have high-risk relapse1. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy of melanoma with anti-PD1 monoclonal
antibodies alone showed evidence of immunological, pathological and clinical responses in 25-30% MPs with
minimal toxicity. Neoajduvant PD1/CTLA4 blockade further improved pathological and clinical responses while
causing grade 3 adverse events in 73-90% treated melanoma patients. These observations suggest that
Neoadjuvant immunotherapy represents an appealing approach for the early assessment of the efficacy and
toxicity of novel combinatorial immunotherapies of melanoma. In the present application, we propose to
evaluate CMP-001 (CMP), a type A CpG which has several unique properties supporting its potency in
increasing antigen presentation and T cell priming. In contrast to other CpGs tested in the clinic, CMP appears
to potently induce IFNα but no IL10 production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It is therefore a very
promising therapeutic agent to circumvent the lack of IFNα production observed in “cold” tumors, which are
poorly T cell-infiltrated and fail to response to immune checkpoint blockade. To evaluate the efficacy and
toxicity of CMP in melanoma, we have implemented the first-in-human neoadjuvant clinical trial with CMP
intratumoral and Nivolumab (CMP/Nivolumab) in PD1 naïve high-risk resectable melanoma patients. The
primary end-point of the study is the rate of major pathologic response, comprising pathological complete and
near-complete as assessed using consensus criteria. In this application, we will determine the mechanisms of
responses or resistance to CMP/Nivolumab. Based on our preliminary findings, we investigate whether
CMP/Nivolumab :1) increases pDC activation and maturation in the tumor microenvironment to promote
CD8+TIL expansion and functions; 2) induces melanoma cell death and primes potent neoepitope-specific
CD8+T cells; and 3) fails to induce potent T cell responses because of melanoma cell-extrinsic or melanoma
cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Collectively, the findings in this application will improve our understanding of the
mechanisms of response and resistance to CMP/Nivolumab in melanoma. They will further support novel
combinatorial immunotherapies to further enhance the immunogenicity and clinical activity of CMP/Nivolumab
in melanoma."
10755372,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular risk factors have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, however,
mechanisms underlying heart-brain hemodynamic coupling are not well understood. Aortic stiffening has been
associated with increased dementia risk. In addition to brain changes typically associated with aging,
cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease also affect vascular function and neuronal structure. However,
the heart and brain are not usually evaluated in the same MRI exam, rather, in separate scanning sessions with
highly specialized protocols focused on either cardiovascular or brain imaging. Recently, our group and others
have established advanced MRI techniques to capture measures such as cardio- and cerebrovascular
hemodynamics and brain structure in the same MRI exam. Measuring aortic hemodynamics (e.g., pulse wave
velocity), together with intracranial pulsatility and brain abnormalities associated with cerebrovascular disease
and Alzheimer's disease, will provide critical insights concerning underlying hemodynamic mechanisms. The
proposed research will use advanced MRI techniques for comprehensive analysis of heart-brain hemodynamic
coupling. This project will leverage new developments in cardiovascular imaging, particularly using 4D flow MRI,
that enable full characterization of complex 3D hemodynamics, such as blood flow velocity, reverse flow mapping
and aortic pulse wave velocity. Methodological advances in highly accelerated 4D flow MRI enable integration
of cardiovascular and intracranial 4D flow MRI with quantitative structural analysis of the brain in a single MRI
exam. This combined cardio- and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI with quantitative brain imaging (i.e. “heart-brain
MRI”) will be used to analyze hemodynamic coupling in aging and Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this proposal
is to use novel heart-brain MRI to systematically evaluate hemodynamic coupling relationships in normal aging,
and hypertension, and apply this technique in a pilot study of Alzheimer's disease. In Aims 1 and 2, heart-brain
MRI will be evaluated in healthy adults and those with hypertension at both midlife and later life, to determine
relationships between heart-brain MRI measures in normal aging and how hypertension may exacerbate brain
changes with aging. In Aim 3, heart-brain MRI will be applied in a pilot study of Alzheimer's disease to examine
preliminary relationships and help plan future studies. This K01 will provided training in clinical and neuroimaging
aspects of aging and Alzheimer's disease to further the objective of building an independent research program
focused on heart-brain hemodynamic coupling in cognitive aging and dementia, including that caused by
Alzheimer's disease."
10793615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To preserve genomic integrity and maintain homeostasis, cells in our body must effectively respond to both
exogenous and endogenous sources of DNA damage. How cellular DNA damage contribute to human disease,
including neurological disorders and cancer, is a fundamental area of research. For the past thirteen years, my
lab has been focused on studies related to the mechanistic basis of genomic instability. The goal of this MIRA
application is to address critical gaps in our understanding of genome stability pathways and how they are
differentially utilized in dividing versus non-dividing cells for the proper maintenance of cellular homeostasis. By
relaying external information from the cell periphery to the nucleus, cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
respond to growth factors via PI3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling to regulate gene expression and thereby promote
growth and/or survival. Similarly, DNA damage threatens genome integrity and upon detection within the nucleus
elicits DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to aid in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints. For our research
program, we will address unique mechanisms related to how key DDR factors contribute to extracellular growth
factor signaling crosstalk in dividing and non-dividing cells. To establish these mechanisms, we will utilize an
array of innovative experimental approaches including genome-wide sequencing, proximity ligation proteomics,
super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule tracking in live cells. We will test the hypothesis that the DDR
should be viewed as a broader, stress-responsive network linking nuclear and cytoplasmic effectors to maintain
physiological homeostasis through intersecting with growth factor signaling pathways. How this is achieved
mechanistically will be a major focus of this application. The second project involves addressing how genotoxic
stress in dividing cells impacts DNA replication dynamics and to elucidate novel molecular players that regulate
replication fork recovery. Based on our innovative technique called Okazaki fragment sequencing (OK-seq), we
are able to directly quantify the efficiency of replication fork initiation and termination at specific sites throughout
the genome. Using this technique, we will expand our analysis to understand how genotoxic insults and DNA
repair deficiencies contribute to site-specific replication fork-mediated DNA breaks using genome-wide analysis.
Deciphering the mechanisms that contribute to replication-associated genomic instability may provide new
avenues for targeted cancer treatment."
10807010,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Substance use disorder (SUD) is associated with abnormalities in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a
brain region that is activated by drug-predictive cues and contributes to drug seeking. Recent studies show that
non-overlapping cell populations within dmPFC, defined by gene expression or projection target, display unique
activity profiles during reward seeking. Interestingly, even within these defined cell populations considerable cell-
to-cell variability is found suggesting that greater resolution is needed to understand the influence of unique
dmPFC neuronal ensembles on behavior. Overall, the influence of unique dmPFC neuronal ensemble activity
patterns on drug seeking is unclear.
 Activity in the dmPFC is highly suppressed following persistent drug use in rodents and humans, in part due
to the reduced function of channels that control the intrinsic excitability of dmPFC output neurons. Considering
this suppressed excitability, it is surprising that the presentation of drug-associated cues can evoke robust activity
in dmPFC of patients with SUD, with that activity being a reliable predictor of future relapse. Thus, a rapid shift
in the excitability of dmPFC neurons likely occurs during drug-associated cue exposure, a change that may be
controlled by the neuromodulator noradrenaline. In support of this idea, here I show that chemogenetic inhibition
of locus coeruleus noradrenergic axons in dmPFC (LC dmPFC) abolishes cue-induced reinstatement of heroin
seeking. Furthermore, I confirm that downstream dmPFC excitatory output neurons display bidirectional plasticity
following heroin use, becoming hypoactive following heroin self-administration but recovering normal activity
during cue-induced relapse. Considering these findings, here I investigate the hypotheses that noradrenergic
LC dmPFC neurons become active during the presentation of drug-predictive cues (Aim 1), that noradrenergic
activity in dmPFC is critical for cue-induced drug seeking and for amplifying activity in downstream dmPFC
neuronal ensembles (Aim 2), and that activity in select dmPFC neuronal ensembles modulates cue-induced drug
seeking behavior (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments will characterize the activity dynamics and function of
precisely defined dmPFC circuit elements during cue-induced heroin seeking. Findings from these studies are
critical for the development of strategies that could normalize dmPFC activity and reduce relapse vulnerability in
patients suffering from SUD."

Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease, including some liver cancers. However, a significant proportion of patients, particularly those with the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ??24 and debilitating liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal liver metastases, do not receive this life-saving surgery due to a shortage in donor livers. Delayed liver transplantation not only affects the mortality risk and quality of life but also increases health care costs. The current donor utilization practice will exacerbate the existing organ shortage. Many livers are declined for transplantation because a surgeon doubts its viability based on his/her subjective assessment of the organ. Also, many additional livers are never even recovered because of similar concerns. A reliable and objective testing to assess the viability of marginal livers before transplant will help surgeons make informed decisions on the usability of marginal donor livers. Accumulating evidence from our group and others supports that normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) that pumps oxygenated blood with nutrients and medications at normal body temperature to maintain normal metabolic activity of the organ is a safe and feasible means of reconditioning marginal livers. In addition, NMP provides a unique opportunity for the transplant team to test viability of livers by assessing hemodynamic state and metabolic function of the liver graft. Building upon our single center phase 1 trial (NCT04483102), we propose to conduct a phase 2 single-arm multicenter trial (mRESTORE) that will transplant NMP-treated previously declined orphan livers after objective viability testing. The study will evaluate patient and graft survival and secondary transplant outcomes, including biliary complications, for the duration of the study funding period (up to 4 years), conduct mechanistic studies, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of transplantation of NMP-treated livers that would otherwise have been discarded. Nine liver transplant centers and their OPOs that serve race/ethnically diverse patients will participate in this study. During the planning phase, we will finalize the study design and protocol, obtain regulatory approvals and build the operational infrastructure (e.g., case report forms, protocol monitoring plan) to enable timely implementation of the mRESTORE. After the transition to the full study, we will transplant NMP-treated previously declined marginal livers to patients and study their transplant outcomes. In addition, we will investigate hepatocellular injury mechanisms that are affected by NMP of previously declined marginal donor livers, identify liver dysfunction phenotypes of NMP with associated transplant outcomes, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the utilization of NMP-treated liver transplantation. Our study findings will inform a practical strategy to increase the number of transplantable livers, which will shift the paradigm of current donor utilization practices and ultimately improve access to liver transplants and save lives."

Despite much progress in the field of lung biology and pulmonary medicine, a major gap of knowledge
remains in the lack of a broader understanding of the composition and regulation of the lung stem cell
compartment and its behavior in disease and regeneration-repair. Recent studies bring an additional
complexity to the scenario, as they describe injured lung cells in a plastic intermediate state at the
crossroad between resolution to a normal state and abnormal failed repair of the lung. Little is known
about the origin and regulation of these intermediate cell states and their relationship to the programs
that regulate cell fate decisions in the developing lung. There has been also an increasing need to have
a better understanding of the developmental and repair programs in human lung progenitors, their
impact in perinatal conditions and potential link to adult chronic diseases. Here we propose to address
these gaps of knowledge in this research proposal by: a) exploring new observations that identify a
similar transitional state in developing lung epithelial progenitors, to investigate mechanisms of cell
plasticity that balances the cell fate program of airways and alveoli and prevents aberrant lung growth,
b) investigating the developmental origins of dysanaptic lung growth and its link to COPD by integrating
information from genetic-epidemiologic cohorts with that from organoid and mouse genetic models, c)
investigating the impact of fetal–intrauterine environment in the control of plasticity and maturation of
human neonatal airway progenitor cells. Results from these studies will open new perspectives in our
understanding of the mechanisms of how cell fate decisions are regulated in development and disease-
repair providing insights for future therapeutic interventions."
10791777,"ABSTRACT: In addition to antibody production, B lymphocytes are efficient regulators of the immune system
both through direct cell-cell interactions and through secretion of soluble molecules. Recent investigations have
underscored the beneficial role of anti-inflammatory (regulatory) B cells in the central nervous system (CNS),
and shown that B cell depletion can worsen the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. We have
demonstrated for the first time that exogenous B cells can be applied therapeutically to restore function in diverse
injury models, including myocardial infarction, healing of acute and chronic wounds, and controlled cortical
impact (CCI) traumatic brain injury (TBI). In our mouse CCI model a single injection of B cells to the brain
parenchyma at the time of injury significantly reduced learning and memory deficits, reduced lesion volume by
40-60%, as well as gliosis and microglial activation at 35 days post-injury. Preliminary studies show that B cells
administered as late as 6h after CCI remain equally effective in reducing motor learning deficits. Little is known
about the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of B cells in TBI. Here, we propose to investigate
the cellular and molecular mechanisms of B cell-mediated neuroprotection after CCI, ultimately positioning this
novel cell-based therapy for clinical use in the context of contusion TBI. In Aim 1 we will assess at multiple time
points the effect of intraparenchymal B cell administration on neuronal survival and axonal degeneration (1a),
regulation of infiltrating immune cells (1b) and resident microglia (1c), and cell proliferation and differentiation at
the injury site (1d). Based on preliminary mechanistic investigations of B cells in both wound healing and CCI,
we hypothesize that naïve B cells placed at the site of CCI sense local inflammatory signals and damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) via Toll-like receptor (TLR)- and B cell receptor (BCR)-dependent
pathways, and adopt a regulatory phenotype. This cell state is associated with production of anti-inflammatory
cytokines (including IL-10, but also IL-4, IL-35, and TGFβ), that act on adjacent infiltrating and resident (microglia)
immune cells and bias their phenotype towards an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective state. In Aim 2 we will
interrogate the sensor and effector pathways that mediate the neuroprotective effects of B cells in a CCI model.
Targeted gene knockout mouse models will be used to determine the involvement of key molecular pathways
(TLR-dependent vs. CD19/BCR-dependent) in B cell environmental sensing at the injury site (2a) and to define
key effector molecules required for mediating the B cell response to injury (2b). To investigate the role of
microglia as down-stream mediators of inflammatory regulation via IL-10, we will modulate IL-10R expression
on local microglia and test the efficacy of B cell treatment in the absence of responsive microglial partners (2c).
Findings from the proposed studies will establish a foundation for clinical development of a novel, safe and cost-
effective immune cell therapy to address TBI, a major unmet medical need."
10812327,"Only sertraline and paroxetine are currently FDA‐approved to treat PTSD. Other psychotropics are equally
limited to provide optimal respond. This efficacy gap may be particularly great in VA settings. The 2017
VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for The Management of PTSD and Acute Stress Disorder recommends
individual, manualized trauma-focused such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) over other pharmacologic
interventions for the primary treatment of PTSD. However, a recent review of clinical trials of trauma-based
therapies in the military and veteran population showed that 30% to 50% of patients did not demonstrate
clinically meaningful symptom change and two-thirds of patients retained PTSD diagnosis after treatment.
Emerging research indicates that PE therapy may be improved by administration of medications that target
one or more therapeutic mechanisms. Ketamine, an FDA-approved anesthetic with potent non-competitive
glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonistic properties, has shown to promote neuroplasticity in
mood disorders and PTSD. Recent preclinical paradigms of PTSD demonstrated that ketamine enhances the
recall of extinction learning and decrease fear renewal without interference of extinction training. Ketamine
produces a glutamatergic burst that leads to a long-lasting synaptic protein (mTORC1) and neuronal activation
in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPCF). Therefore, ketamine could exert an augmented top-down inhibitory
drive from the mPFC to fear-related amygdala during PE therapy.
Our preliminary data showed that after six ketamine treatment, the remission rate for PTSD (PCL-5 score < 33)
was 80.0 %. PTSD severity by clinician interview (CAPS-5) also demonstrated a significant reduction from a
PTSD baseline of 39.7 (S.D.=9.3) to 20.8 (S.D.= 7.2) after treatment (Cohen’s d’ = 1.85). However, the median
time to relapse for PTSD and depression after six infusions were 41 and 26 days, respectively. This finding
suggests a powerful but short-term therapeutic effect from serial ketamine. We piloted the adjunctive use of
ketamine to enhance the efficacy of standardized PE therapy. Twelve Veterans were consented in 4 months
with 10 of them enrolled in the study, and 7 Veterans received treatment intervention by the time of
submission for this study. Single ketamine infusion administered 24 hours prior to PE session for the first 3
weeks showed to be acceptable, well-tolerated, and showed efficacy to accelerate reduction of PTSD symptoms.
Three Veterans ends PE therapy in 7 sessions instead of the usual 10 sessions as subjects and therapist agreed
that therapeutic goals were already achieved. We also measured cognitive performance and, interestingly, set
shifting tasks remarkably improved throughout the intervention (ketamine and PE).
We plan to conduct a single site (Minneapolis VA) RCT comparing three ketamine treatment vs. active placebo
(midazolam) adjunct to PE therapy among Veterans with PTSD. Pharmacological phase will start
simultaneously with PE session 1. Infusions will be administered 24 hrs. prior to PE session for the first 3
weeks. After PE is completed (session 10), patients will be assessed during a 3-month follow-up period at
various time points. We estimate that out of 100 veterans, 80 will reach time point for primary outcome
measure (CAPS score at week 10) and will be considered for primary analysis. Secondary outcomes include
severity of depression and anxiety scores, safety and tolerability of ketamine-enhanced PE therapy, cognitive
performance during treatment and early improvement during PE related to the rate of dropouts/completers
during PE therapy. Results of the proposed RCT could provide scientific foundation to distinguish the essential
components of this approach, enhance the methodology, elucidate the mechanisms involved, and identify sub-
PTSD populations that most likely benefit from this intervention."
10731376,"Background: Cirrhosis is the final common pathway of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis caused most
commonly by alcohol or viral infection with hepatitis C and/or B. HMG-coA reductase inhibitors (statins) are
thought to be beneficial in liver disease by ameliorating intrahepatic endothelial dysfunction, inflammation
and fibrosis, thereby leading to a reduction in portal pressure. Because clinically significant portal
hypertension is the main driver of decompensation, a reduction in portal pressure (demonstrated in both
experimental and human cirrhosis) will prevent hepatic decompensation.
Objectives: This phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study will assess
whether simvastatin can delay/prevent hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), need for
liver transplantation or death in Veterans with compensated cirrhosis at a high-risk of decompensation.
Specific Aims: 1) To demonstrate that statin therapy in patients with cirrhosis at high-risk for hepatic
decompensation will reduce the incidence of hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, all-cause
mortality and need for liver transplantation; 2) to assess the impact of statin exposure on health-related
quality of life in patients with compensated cirrhosis; and 3) to explore the impact of chronic simvastatin on
portal hypertension in patients with compensated cirrhosis.
Study Design: Patients with compensated cirrhosis at high-risk for hepatic decompensation will be
stratified based upon the presence or absence of varices and randomized to simvastatin 40mg/day or
placebo for up to 24 months. Patients will be observed for the development of hepatic decompensation
(variceal hemorrhage, ascites, encephalopathy), HCC, liver-related death, death from any cause, and/or
complications of statin therapy. The primary study endpoint is the effect of statin therapy on reducing the
incidence of hepatic decompensation and HCC. Secondary endpoints are to assess the effect of statin
therapy on mortality, need for liver transplantation, health related quality of life in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis, to assess the impact of statins on portal hypertension, and to explore the
interaction of SLCO1B1 and KIF6 polymorphisms on safety and clinical efficacy of statin therapy.
Clinical Impact: There are an estimated 35,000 individuals with cirrhosis receiving ongoing medical care
within the VA healthcare system. Approximately 15,000 liver decompensation-related hospitalizations occur
annually in the VA with a mean length of stay of 9 days. The current estimated total healthcare expenditure
for an ‘average’ Veteran with cirrhosis approximates $23,000 per year, three times greater than age-
matched controls. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis have nearly double the annual costs,
predominantly related to hospitalizations. Simvastatin, at a cost of $25-50 per year, if proven to safely
reduce liver decompensation and death, would have tremendous health benefits for Veterans and would
result in significant cost savings for the VA healthcare system. A randomized controlled trial would be
essential to support the efficacy and safety of statins in compensated cirrhosis and would foster a significant
change in practice."
10795656,"Abstract: Molecular Mechanisms of Adjuvant Triplet Combinations
The immune system makes decisions in response to complex combinations of microbial inputs. Live vaccines
that are empirically attenuated from pathogens have been a powerful means to yield life-long immunity against
many deadly pathogens because they mimic immune responses to combinations of microbial signals. However,
the rational design of non-live vaccines using immunomodulatory agents such as adjuvants has remained an
elusive task in many cases where live vaccination is not efficacious or feasible, in part because identifying potent
adjuvant combinations and associated molecular mechanisms that explain cross talk remains a major challenge.
Based on our recent findings and extensive preliminary data, we propose to define the molecular mechanisms
through which two adjuvant triplets – containing agonists for Toll-like receptor (TLR), C-type lection receptor
(CLR), RIG-I-like receptor (RLR), and cytosolic dsDNA sensor (CDS) pathways – induce protective CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell responses in mice. We will use an innovative approach which is (i) comparative – by contrasting the
quantitative effects of adjuvant triplets and matching singles and pairs as means to accurately pinpoint molecular
mechanisms explaining cross talk; and (ii) multiscale – by studying molecular mechanisms at play in cells, tissues,
and the whole body. First, we will determine the molecular mechanisms of intra-cellular signaling cross talk by
adjuvant triplets by testing hypotheses at the level of protein complexes proximal to adjuvant receptors,
phosphorylation cascades and kinase-substrate relationships, and gene regulatory networks. Second, we will
identify the molecular mechanisms through which adjuvant combinations impact inter-cellular signaling between
dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells by testing hypotheses on the regulatory mechanisms shaping the cellular,
surface, and secreted proteome of DCs. Third, we will test hypotheses on the effects of adjuvant triplets on the
organism-wide spreading and seeding of effector and memory T cells, and the underlying cell circuits of the skin
(vaccination site) and draining lymph node that explain the induction of protective, long-term T cell immunity.
Results from this work will produce critical insights at the forefront of adjuvant combination research by
characterizing higher-order combinations of adjuvants that can mimic the effects of well-established, potent live
attenuated vaccines and inform future vaccine designs against infection."

downstream health. An individual’s microbiome also modifies the health effects of toxicants such as arsenic by
transforming them into potentially more or less harmful substances. Thus, understanding the impacts of arsenic
on the microbiome, and vice versa, is key to achievable prevention and interventions to mitigate the risk of
arsenic to human health – a key goal of the NIEHS. Our team’s prior work using the New Hampshire Birth Cohort
Study, with ongoing enrollment and a projected size of 3,000 mother-infant dyads, identified an impact of toxic
metals on the developing microbiome during the critical window of 0–3 years of age, when microbes are required
for immune development. Specifically, our team showed both a sex-specific dysbiosis and a depletion of the
immune-training microbe Bacteroides in arsenic-exposed infants/children. Importantly, this work revealed
associations between arsenic exposure, changes in the microbiome, and early immune-mediated health
outcomes, including respiratory disease. Our team’s recent work indicates a gut-lung link for arsenic-exposed
infants depleted for Bacteroides, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis that gut microbiome composition is a
key driver of airway health. This project will test the hypothesis that in the sensitive early-life window (0–3 years),
when the developing immune system requires interaction with microbes, arsenic affects the developing
microbiome, resulting in a paucity of Bacteroides and its secreted metabolites and ultimately associating with
increased inflammation and risk of respiratory diseases such as wheeze, upper respiratory tract infection, and
pneumonia later in life (out to 12 years of age).
AIM 1. Test the hypotheses, using the longitudinal NHBCS and novel bioinformatic tools, that (i) early-life As
 exposures via food/water are related to sex-specific perturbations in the intestinal microbiome and (ii) the early-
 life intestinal microbiome modifies or mediates the effects of As exposure on respiratory health outcomes.
AIM 2. Test the hypothesis that As enhances secretion of IL-8 from intestinal epithelia due to lack of a key
 Bacteroides-secreted short chain fatty acid, propionate, ultimately resulting from changes in the epigenome.
AIM 3. Test the hypothesis that add-back of Bacteroides can reverse the effect of Bacteroides-depleted stool in a
 mouse model, thus serving as a proof-of-concept for probiotic interventions."

outcomes that follow from it."
10767770,"The main goal of this application is to clarify the signaling mechanisms mediating biliary senescence
and angiogenesis during primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). It is known that (i) endothelin (ET)-1
signaling is enhanced in the bile duct ligation (BDL) model of obstructive cholestasis, (ii) it is primarily upregulated
in cholangiocytes and (iii) enhances liver fibrosis via hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation. Outside of the liver,
ET-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and enhances transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1, pro-angiogenic factor)
expression in vascular endothelial cells (VECs). Overall, it is unknown how ET signaling (including ET-2 and ET-
3) mediate biliary senescence and VEC proliferation/angiogenesis during PSC. Additionally, changes in the
vascular bed and VEC proliferation during PSC is unknown. We found that ET-1, ET-2, ET-3 and ET-A and
ET-B are increased, particularly in cholangiocytes and VECs, in human PSC and the multidrug resistance-2
knockout (Mdr2-/-) mouse model of PSC. Furthermore, we have novel preliminary data showing increased VEC
proliferation and angiogenesis in both human PSC and in Mdr2-/- mice. Changes in angiogenesis versus
vasopenia during cholestasis is controversial, but considering PSC patients with portal hypertension have an
increased morbidity and mortality, there is likely some underlying VEC-mediated changes occurring. Therefore,
our novel findings are the first to indicate liver VEC proliferation and angiogenesis during PSC. Additionally,
these findings are the first to delve into ET signaling in cholangiocytes and VECs during PSC. We provide data
indicating a feedback loop, whereby ET signaling promotes TGF-β1 expression, which can in turn increase miR-
125b/HIF-1α expression, which is known to increase ET expression. These are the first data demonstrating a
positive feedback loop between ET/TGF-β1/miR-125b/HIF-1α that can perpetuate biliary senescence and liver
fibrosis in autocrine and paracrine manners. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of ET-A or ET-B in Mdr2-/-
mice using currently FDA-approved drugs (for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension) reduces biliary
senescence and liver fibrosis when compared to controls. Our overall hypothesis is that cholangiocytes and
liver VEC communicate with one another via endothelin ET/TGF-β1 signaling that increases biliary
senescence and VEC angiogenesis through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Our findings may lead
to the identification of new, effective therapeutics for the treatment of PSC. This application proposal is the first
step to developing independence for the PI, Dr. Lindsey Kennedy. This proposal elegantly marries the
background work of her mentors on cholangiocyte biology, microRNA signaling and angiogenesis with new
techniques and concepts that further delve into vascular biology during cholestasis. Following successful
completion of this application, Dr. Kennedy will have a better understanding of angiogenesis/vasopenia, VEC
biology and vascular interactions with the bile ducts, and this can develop into independent studies. The KEY
ELEMENTS of this research proposal are the (i) strong mentoring team developed, who will provide top-tier
training for the applicant, (ii) introduction of new techniques (ink injection, corrosion casting, VEC isolation,
human primary cell isolation) and concepts (vascular biology in cholestasis), (iii) comprehensive mentoring and
career plan, including one-on-one training, conference attendance, presentation opportunities and development
of grantsmanship, and (iv) opportunity for the applicant to develop her own independent, successful research
lab."
10766133,"ABSTRACT
Metabolic and chronic liver diseases are among the leading causes of death in the US. The liver is a central hub
that coordinately regulates the metabolism of many nutrients, including lipids. The liver does not store lipids in
the long-term, and lipid accumulation in the liver results in different diseases. Triglyceride accumulation in the
liver causes steatosis which can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), both part of the non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) spectrum. Accumulation of bile acids in the liver because of viral infections, alcohol
use or more advanced liver damage causes cholestasis. Identification of the molecular mechanisms of specific
disease-promoting pathways is an essential step before pathways can be safely targeted for disease prevention.
Our studies will further the understanding of the role of peroxisomal ABCD transporters in the liver. We have
used an unbiased systems biology approach to identify new players in the regulation of lipid metabolism in the
liver. Through these methods, we identified the peroxisomal transporter ABCD3 as a novel regulator of hepatic
lipid metabolism. Abcd3−/− mice are partially lethal and loss of ABCD3 in surviving animals alters the hepatic
lipidome and results in hepatomegaly and profoundly reduced biliary bile acids. To study ABCD3 in vivo, we
have developed and validated a novel AAV-CRISPR strategy to disrupt Abcd3 exclusively in the liver, allowing
us to disrupt Abcd3 in adult wild-type mice in a temporal fashion to determine the sequelae of events leading to
the defects observed after loss of ABCD3. Using these tools, we show that acute loss of hepatic ABCD3 in adult
mice is sufficient to recapitulate the dramatic reduction in biliary bile acids. When fed a Western diet (WD), loss
of hepatic ABCD3 results in liver lipid accumulation as well as elevated plasma liver enzymes and bile acids, all
hallmarks of NASH. We have designed two specific aims; in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that ABCD3
deficiency results in cholestasis and NASH. In Aim 2, we will identify specific substrates for ABCD3 and test the
hypothesis that peroxisomal lipid defects are pathogenic and key for the development of NASH. Our studies
demonstrate that loss of ABCD3, which is lethal in humans, results in cholestasis and NASH in a setting of
elevated lipid levels. Completion of these studies will further the understanding of the role of peroxisomal ABCD
transporters in the liver, and implicate peroxisomal lipid metabolism as an important contributor in the
pathogenesis of NASH."
10771123,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antibiotics have transformed the human health and disease landscape. However, the use and
misuse of such antimicrobial drugs accelerate the emergence of bacterial strains resistant
against antibiotics, so that standard treatment options eventually become ineffective. In light of
these critical needs, thiopeptides have emerged as a promising platform for the discovery of
new therapeutic leads. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize the preparation of 26-membered
thiopeptides by inventing a new cyclodehydration methods to facilitate the synthetic campaign.
The methods established in this aim will be validated in the context of representative
azole/azoline-containing antimicrobial peptides. In Aim 2, we will optimize a streamlined
synthesis of 35-membered thiopeptides by integrating Mo-catalyzed cyclodehydrations and site-
selective Dha mutations. These findings will unlock the translational potential of a previously
unexplored class of potent antibiotics. In Aim 3, we will develop an automated platform for
rational thiopeptide design and modifications, and integrate it with microbiological, biophysical,
and computational studies to generate promising leads suitable for pre-clinical and clinical
investigations. Successful realization of the abovementioned aims will establish innovative tools
for the synthesis of thiopeptides and other bioactive macrocyclic peptides. Because of the
importance of azol(in)es as the key structural elements in bioactive natural products of
biomedical relevance, the discoveries of this study will have a transformative impact on the
development of new therapies."
10758826,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The mammalian lung has the capacity to repair itself following various injuries. Alveolar
repair is a dynamic and coordinated process whereby stem/progenitor cells in the lung undergo differentiation
into specialized cells to repair the damaged epithelium. Recent studies have uncovered a distinct intermediate
progenitor cell state that exists during the transition between stem/progenitor cells and these specialized cells;
however, the dynamic cellular behaviors and molecular regulatory landscape that drives intermediate progenitor
cell transitions toward repair is poorly understood. Here, we propose two aims to dissect the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that control alveolar repair in vivo in the regenerating mammalian lung. First (Aim 1) we
will utilize a permanent lung imaging window system to track the emergence, live behaviors and terminal
differentiation of individual intermediate progenitor cells over time during alveolar repair. Second (Aim 2) we will
utilize combined scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq together with advanced dynamical analysis and machine learning
techniques to define the cellular state space (gene expression and chromatin accessibility), cellular trajectories
and regulatory landscape of transitioning intermediate progenitor cells. We will perform both aims using
complimentary in vivo lung injury models and fluorescent report mice in order to track the mechanisms that are
unique to intermediate progenitor cells and potentially dependent on their cellular origin and/or injury context.
This project will generate extensive, high quality datasets to enable quantitative and predictive models of the key
regulatory mechanisms that mammalian drive alveolar repair in vivo. Given that many of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of lung biology are conserved between mouse and human, our findings have the potential
to uncover putative targets for modulating alveolar repair in the context of human disease."
10846552,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Nearly 1 million Americans each year experience a first venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is typically viewed as an acute event that is
treatable by anticoagulants, with less focus on chronic adverse VTE sequelae or on rehabilitation. Adults who
have experienced an incident VTE may be at high risk for adverse VTE sequelae in the first 12 months after
their event, including patient-relevant symptoms (such as dyspnea, pain, and swelling) and adverse clinical
outcomes (VTE recurrence and death). Research to-date has characterized the post-thrombotic syndrome
occurring post-DVT, but there has been much less attention given to sequelae following an incident PE.
Furthermore, almost all research about sequelae after both DVT and PE has been in the context of
anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists rather than with newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), which
are now primarily used in practice. Clinically, we lack methods to identify adults at greatest risk of adverse VTE
sequelae and how to prevent these sequelae. Whether several promising biomarkers that are readily available
for clinical measurement (brain natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, and troponin), or, whether modifiable exposures
such as anticoagulant type or physical activity are associated with adverse VTE sequelae is incompletely
understood. In the proposed research, we will characterize patient-relevant symptoms and adverse clinical
outcomes at multiple timepoints in the first 12 months post-VTE and will evaluate biomarkers and modifiable
risk factors in relation to these VTE sequelae. To accomplish this, we will create a new prospective population-
based inception cohort study based in Kaiser Permanente Washington, an integrated healthcare delivery
system in Washington State. Our preliminary research supports the feasibility of daily identification of incident
VTE cases among adult enrollees, and we anticipate ~957 eligible adults with validated VTE across 33 months
of enrollment. De novo data collection in ~380 consenting adults will include: 1) surveys at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6,
and 12 months post-VTE to collect information on post-VTE symptoms, 2) wrist-worn accelerometers to
objectively measure physical activity and resting heart rate in the 12 months post-VTE, and 3) blood collection
within 4 weeks of the incident VTE to measure 3 pre-specified biomarkers. These study data will be combined
with rich electronic health record data to accomplish 3 scientific aims: (1) Characterize the prevalence pattern
of symptoms at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-incident VTE and clinical outcomes over the 12
months of follow-up; (2) evaluate the associations of key biomarker levels measured in blood collected within 4
weeks of the incident VTE; and, (3) evaluate modifiable risk factors for sequalae, including VTE anticoagulant
type and physical activity level. This research will fill critical knowledge gaps that are important to patients by
providing estimates of the prevalence of clinically burdensome VTE sequelae and identifying possible etiologic
and modifiable risk factors that can be targeted in future interventions."
10771932,"Asthma is characterized by excessive bronchoconstriction and a heightened sensitivity to inhaled irritants.
Airway nerves control these responses. Recently, we found that eosinophils, which are a defining feature of
airway inflammation in a majority of asthmatics, increased sensory nerve density in humans with asthma and in
mice. Increased innervation produced exaggerated neuronally-mediated reflex bronchoconstriction. These
data show that eosinophil-induced nerve remodeling has a key role in the development of excessive
bronchoconstriction in asthma. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that eosinophils increase
airway nerve density in asthma by releasing granule proteins that induce neurotrophins, which in turn
promote nerve growth and potentiate nerve-mediated reflex bronchoconstriction. We will test this
hypothesis in three aims that will 1) determine the role of eosinophil granule proteins EPX and MBP in sensory
and parasympathetic nerve remodeling, neurotrophin expression and nerve-mediated reflex
bronchoconstriction 2) test which neurotrophins mediate eosinophil-induced nerve remodeling and reflex
bronchoconstriction and 3) determine whether airway hyperinnervation is reversed in humans with asthma by
measuring airway nerves in bronchoscopic airway biopsies before and after initiation of the anti-IL5 antibody
mepolizumab. Effects of eosinophil depletion will also be tested in mice with established hyperinnervation. The
ultimate goals of this study are to discover new asthma mechanisms and to identify drug targets that will
prevent and/or reverse effects of nerve dysfunction in asthma."
10771096,"The current proposal describes experimental approaches to determine how neurons regulate
structural and functional maturation of active zones (AZs), a key signaling hub where synaptic
communication occurs. Although membrane trafficking mechanisms are highly conserved
across cells, additional synapse-specific regulation has evolved to mediate rapid Ca2+-
dependent synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion at specialized presynaptic AZs that are precisely aligned
to postsynaptic receptors. Multiple evolutionarily conserved proteins are found at AZs, including
RIM, RIM binding protein, Syd-1, Liprin-α,
ELKS/CAST/Bruchpilot (BRP), Bassoon/Piccolo/Fife
and Unc13. Previous studies in our lab demonstrated that the hundreds of AZs formed by a
single glutamatergic motoneuron in Drosophila have a heterogeneous distribution of synaptic
strength, with neighboring AZs often showing >50-fold differences in the probability of release
(Pr) of SVs. We found that AZ maturation drives increased synaptic strength occur over a multi-
day developmental period, with newly formed AZs developing as weak Pr sites before maturing
into high Pr AZs through the coordinated accumulation of a core set of proteins. In the current
application, we will determine how neurons regulate structural and functional maturation of AZs,
and how variations in these processes drive synaptic diversity. The mechanisms regulating AZ
maturation fall into two broad categories: those that control cell-wide availability of key building
blocks to growing AZs (Aim 1) and those that affect capture and retention of new material at
individual AZs (Aim 2). We will determine whether specific AZ proteins are produced and
transported in excess of their incorporation into growing AZs, or whether their availability at the
synaptic terminal is rate-limiting for AZ maturation. In addition, we will characterize the efficiency
of material capture at individual AZs throughout the AZ maturation cycle. Finally, we will
examine how material availability and capture differ in tonic and phasic motoneurons that
innervate the same postsynaptic muscle, but display striking differences in their AZ organization
and SV release properties (Aim 3). These studies will provide new insights into how synaptic
strength develops across the cohort of AZs of a neuron, as well as how synaptic diversity can
be more broadly controlled across neuronal subclasses."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide the applicant with selected additional skills required for an
applicant to become an independent NIH-funded investigator capable of designing and implementing early phase
geroscience-guided clinical trials that have the potential to extend healthy lifespan by targeting biological aging.
This custom-designed learning experience will be enhanced by three unique components. First, a Patterson
Trust-funded study “The Mito-Frail Trial: Effects of MitoQ on Vasodilation, Mobility and Cognitive Performance
in Frail Older Adults” will provide a research platform. Second, the NIA Translational Geroscience Network (R33
AG061456) and its Facility for Geroscience Analysis has agreed to provide learning experiences and subsidized
measurements of biomarkers permitting a much broader and deeper analysis of biological hallmarks of aging.
Third, the NIA Geroscience Education and Training Network (R25 AG073119) will permit the candidate to fulfill
the requirements for a Certificate in Geroscience at UConn, one of the network's current five sites.
Chronic diseases and associated declines in physical and cognitive performance contribute greatly to lost
independence with aging. In addition to a lack of effective interventions other than exercise to address either
problem, few studies have examined strategies for targeting both conditions in frail individuals who may
experience difficulties with both walking and memory. Use of geroscience-guided therapies permits us to target
mechanisms shared by aging with chronic conditions for which aging represents a major risk factor. Thus, instead
of focusing on one single disease at a time, it may be possible to delay the onset and progression of disability
involving multiple functional domains including those caused by Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.
We have recently shown that MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant known to improve endothelial function
and Nitric Oxide (NO) bioavailability, may also restore impaired flow-mediated vasodilation in frail older adults,
enhancing gait speed. In the Mito-Frail study we now wish to explore the hypothesis that MitoQ attenuates aging-
related declines in flow-mediated vasodilation involving both peripheral and cerebral blood vessels. At the same
time, we will obtain feasibility and pilot data involving measures of physical mobility and cognitive performance
that may help us design and power a future clinical trial. Ultimately, we seek to develop strategies for preventing
or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease and the vascular contribution to dementia.
Therefore, Aim 1 will assess peripheral and cerebral NO bioavailability and mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (mtROS) levels in older adults who are healthy, others who are frail with slow walking speed and those
who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Aim 2 will determine whether MitoQ supplementation can
improve vasodilation with enhancing cognitive function. The proposed research will provide essential training for
the candidate who will establish expertise as an independent NIA-funded investigator conducting cutting-edge
translational geroscience research designed to maintain and enhance functional independence in older adults."

 The human oral microbiome is home to a unique group of bacteria with the ability to affect the overall
health of the human host: Streptococci spp. This group is involved in a wide range of diseases, from dental
caries to infective endocarditis. They include important oral pathogens such as the cariogenic Streptococcus
mutans and commensal organisms such as Streptococcus mitis. These important oral members produce a
large array of radical-S-adenosylmethionine ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides
(RaS-RiPPs). The newly identified compounds include a wealth of chemical structures and have been found to
inhibit the growth of other oral Streptococci, as well as modulate the behavior of producer organisms
themselves. The initial goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism of action of the RaS-RiPP tryglysin
from S. mutans, and to examine its impact on the functional oral microbiome. Upon defining tryglysin’s
mechanism of action on oral Streptococci and the oral microbiome, this study will be expanded to examine the
biological significance of other RaS-RiPPs produced by Streptococci: streptosactin, suisactin, rotapeptides,
and NxxC family peptides. While the chemical structure and synthesis of these peptides has been defined, the
biological significance of these identified RaS-RiPPs is unexplored. Given the important status of Streptococci
spp. to the health of the human oral microbiota, this represents a major gap in knowledge about a class of
peptides with huge potential impacts on overall oral health. This proposal aims to create a research platform
for studying RaS-RiPPs from oral Streptococci, defining their function, and examining shifts in the functional
oral microbiome in response to their production. Executing this research program at the University of Illinois at
Chicago (UIC) will allow for the establishment of the candidate as an independent researcher and provide
avenues for the achievement of the candidate’s career goals: establishing a productive and first-rate research
laboratory and securing a tenured faculty position at a major research institution."
10817766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Therapeutic goals in pediatric Crohn's Disease (CD) have shifted from clinical improvement or remission to
endoscopic healing (EH) by ileocolonoscopy and transmural healing (TH) by magnetic resonance enterography
(MRE). Patients achieving complete healing (CH, EH and TH) experience fewer hospitalizations or surgery. We
hypothesize that specific pre-treatment clinical, radiologic, transcriptomic, genomic, and microbial factors along
with attainment of targeted anti-TNF biologic exposure will be associated with the primary endpoint, CH, and the
major secondary endpoints, EH and TH, 52 weeks after anti-TNF start. We will test this hypothesis in a
prospective cohort study of 550 newly diagnosed pediatric-onset CD subjects treated with anti-TNF medication
within 6 months of diagnosis guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
Aim 1. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between CH and baseline
measures of clinical and radiologic severity. We hypothesize that pre-treatment nutritional status,
antimicrobial serologies, and MRE findings will be associated with year 1 CH. Formal hypothesis tests will be
carried out with appropriately controlled Type I error probabilities to confirm the predictive power of a set of pre-
specified baseline measures using a logistic regression model based on the year 1 CH outcome.
Aim 2. Evaluate putative associations and explore novel associations between anti-TNF drug levels, CH,
and host and microbial genomic and transcriptomic factors. We hypothesize that pre-treatment gene
expression signatures and microbial factors will be associated with early anti-TNF drug levels and year 1 CH.
We will characterize the host genotype, baseline mucosal and longitudinal fecal microbial taxonomic profile, and
baseline ileal and colon host transcriptome. Those variables identified as significantly associated will be
candidates for the final prediction model determined in Aim 3.
Aim 3. Use a k-fold cross-validation procedure to determine the optimal predictive model of year 1 CH.
We hypothesize that a model which includes host gene signatures and microbes will improve prediction of CH
beyond one based on clinical and imaging factors alone. The model will include clinical and imaging predictors
from Aim 1 and host and microbial characteristics found to be potentially explanatory in Aim 2.
Impact. The proposed inception cohort study, CAMEO, will provide a robust platform to study factors that
contribute to healing in pediatric CD that can then be translated into practice, as well as guiding future therapies
targeting the host immune response and microbiota in patients unlikely to achieve healing.

10771970,"Nephrotic syndrome and other glomerular diseases are major causes of chronic kidney diseases world-wide.
The molecular mechanisms of NS are not completely known, and this major gap in knowledge is an impediment
to treating patients with NS and developing new treatments. A more complete understanding of the mechanisms
underlying NS is critical for identification of robust non-invasive diagnostic tools and precise effective treatment
options. In preliminary data, we identified pathogenic variants in the genes regulator of calcineurin (CN) types 1-
3 (RCAN1-3) in patients with NS. We showed that cells expressing mutant RCAN1 displayed elevated CN activity
and increased apoptosis. These phenotypes were rescued by pharmacological inhibition of CN. Our findings
suggest that variants in RCAN genes are novel genetic causes of NS, and that modulators of CN signaling may
represent targeted therapy for individuals with NS induced by RCAN mutations, the more common idiopathic NS
and other glomerular diseases. Despite the fact, that unregulated CN activation is central to the pathogenesis of
multiple glomerular disease processes and CN inhibitors (CNIs) are often used for treatment, the signaling
pathways regulated by RCAN proteins specifically are not well understood. Further, only ~30-50% of patients
with steroid resistant NS will achieve remission with CNI treatment and there are currently no biomarkers to
predict therapy response despite major side effects of CNI including nephrotoxicity. The overarching hypothesis
of this study is that genetic defects in RCAN genes cause CNI responsive NS by reducing podocyte viability due
to aberrant cytoskeletal dynamics that can be ameliorated by targeting modulators of RCAN activity. We will test
our hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Determine the effect of pathogenic variants in RCAN genes on CNI
therapy response in patients with NS, 2) Determine the molecular mechanisms mediating the aberrant
phenotypes caused by pathogenic RCAN variants in patient derived iPSC podocytes and iPSC-kidney
organoids, and 3) Identify targeted therapies that can rescue the aberrant RCAN phenotypes in ex-vivo
podocytes. Data generated from these studies will define the role of genetic defects in RCAN genes in disease
pathogenesis and CNI therapy response in patients with NS. In addition, the study will reveal podocyte signaling
mechanisms that are dysregulated due to defective RCAN genes and ultimately lead to identification of novel or
repurposed therapeutic alternatives to CNI treatment."
10833467,"Abstract
Iron is essential for eukaryotic life acting as a biological catalytic center of various proteins involved in diverse
cellular processes. In human, the greatest portion of total body iron can be found as heme (an iron-containing
porphyrin), the majority of which is in red blood cells in the form of hemoglobin that carries oxygen from the
lung to the whole body. An imbalanced supply of iron, heme, or globin proteins leads to the shortage of
functional hemoglobin, resulting in various types of anemia. Insufficient iron supply is particularly critical, as it
causes so-called iron deficiency anemia, the most common form of anemia worldwide. Understanding the
regulation of hemoglobin synthesis in erythroid cells is important for developing novel therapeutic strategies to
treat red blood cell disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation have not been
fully understood. This research proposal aims to uncover these mechanisms by delineating iron-dependent
regulation of the mitochondrial protein DELE1. It has been recently shown that in response mitochondrial
stress, DELE1 acts as an activator of the stress responsive kinase HRI, a well-established regulator of globin
translation in the erythroid lineage. Preliminary results in this proposal indicate that DELE1 activates HRI in
iron-depleted cells by a novel mechanism distinct from previously reported mechanisms. These results also
suggest the mitochondrial import of DELE1 and its subsequent protein stability is strictly regulated by
intracellular iron availability. Thus, this proposal will test the hypothesis that iron-dependent mitochondrial
proteostasis and import regulation of DELE1 are the core components of a novel mitochondrial iron-sensing
pathway regulating the HRI-mediated stress response. The mechanisms how mitochondrial DELE1 activates
cytosolic HRI in iron deficient conditions will be investigated using multiple advanced molecular biology
techniques, in combination with mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The involvement of the DELE1-HRI
pathway in terminal erythroid differentiation will be addressed using a murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell
line, an established erythroid cellular model, as well as a recently generated DELE1 deficient mouse. The
success of the proposed work will provide novel molecular insights into mitochondrial iron-sensing and
reveal the critical molecular players that are responsible for the communication between mitochondria and
the cytosol in order to maintain cellular homeostasis under iron-deficient conditions."
10758269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the mechanistic and evolutionary causes of
variation in complex traits. The primary experimental approach is to perform large-scale analyses of single-cell
traits of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and follows two major lines of work. One line of work aims
to understand how interaction between genes (epistasis) contributes to natural trait variation. Understanding
the sources of variation in complex traits is a major goal in biomedical research because this knowledge
impinges directly on the prospect of personalized medicine, for example the prediction of disease risk from an
individual’s genotype. If not taken into account, epistasis can confound such predictions. Epistasis is also
important because it can constrain evolutionary adaptation to follow particular paths, making adaptation more
predictable. This predictability could be valuable in the treatment of diseases that have a strong evolutionary
component, such as microbial infections and cancer. Although epistasis has been well studied using lab-
derived mutations, as well as in some cases of viruses or microbes under strong pressures to evolve, its role in
determining how traits vary in natural populations is poorly understood. Key goals of this research program
are to perform experiments with dramatically increased power to detect interactions, and to expand the range
of traits that are studied to include cell shape and size, which are important in many disease processes. These
studies will leverage recent progress in using high-throughput, microscopy-based methods to quantify many
independent cellular features, and they will create and use strains of S. cerevisiae that make searching for
epistasis much more powerful. The other line of work aims to understand molecular mechanisms that allow
clonal cell populations to generate heterogeneity that might be beneficial in the face of environmental
uncertainty. Such heterogeneity is seen in the responses of pathogenic microbes and tumor cells to drugs, and
therefore has major clinical implications, yet there is very little known about how heterogeneity is regulated
and how it can be altered. Recent work has shown that clonal populations of S. cerevisiae contain fast-growing
cells that are susceptible to acute stress and slow-growing cells that are tolerant of acute stress, and that these
differences are mediated by variable activity of the conserved Ras/cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway. The
role of this kinase in tuning growth rates and stress tolerances will be probed using chemical-genetic
manipulation. The goal is to better understand the mechanistic basis of adaptive heterogeneity in this model
system, and ultimately to advance treatment of persistent pathogens and cancers."

biophysics has expanded from the structure-function paradigm to include dynamics - population of ensembles
of protein states (conformational heterogeneity) and their interconversion. Fully delineating the dynamics that
underlie function is however complicated by the immense complexity of proteins, due to both their large size
with spatial heterogeneity of their chemistry and the broad timescales over which states may interconvert,
ranging from large-scale processes such as aggregation that occur over days to years to the picosecond
fluctuations of side chains and solvent. Among these scales, the local small-scale changes in proteins that
involve rapidly interconverting states are perhaps among the most challenging to characterize and least well
understood. However, such motions are argued to be central to many aspects of protein function, such as
main contributors to the entropy of reactions, allosteric communication within domains, catalytic and binding
specificity, et al.
 This research program is directed at developing rigorous methodologies to advance understanding of
fundamental protein biophysics in important biological processes. We are developing infrared (IR) spectroscopy
as an approach with inherently high spatial and temporal resolution for accessing all involved conformational
ensembles and dynamics. By incorporating vibrational groups with frequencies within a transparent window of
protein IR spectra we avoid the complexity of spectral congestion to enable inspection of single vibrational modes
at local sites anywhere throughout proteins. We are combining modern approaches in biochemistry for selective
labeling with state-of-the-art methods in multidimensional spectroscopy to provide rigorous analysis of frequency
heterogeneity, coupling, and dynamics. The application and development of new biochemical and spectroscopic
methods should elucidate the biophysical foundations of protein function with unprecedented detail, providing
information with promise to buttress advances in broad areas of biology and medicine. In addition, through
execution of this project, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers will be broadly trained in
multidisciplinary science, strengthening the nation’s scientific workforce."
10795961,"DNA Nanostructures for High-Throughput Cryo-EM Studies of Small Macromolecules
Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an approach for visualizing structures of
macromolecules and their complexes at near-native conditions without the need for large sample
quantities or the removal of flexible regions often required for alternative techniques such as X-ray
crystallography. Improvements in microscopy hardware and software have helped to achieve near-
atomic structure determination of macromolecules by cryo-EM allowing, for example, the visualization
of individual amino-acid side chains of protein targets. However, structure determination by cryo-EM
remains challenging for many macromolecules. Small (<100 kDa) particles can be especially difficult
to study because they lack well-defined structural features required for the image alignment step of
3D reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we constructed tiny goniometers—instruments that precisely orient
objects—using DNA nanotechnology. Our molecular goniometers can dock a single DNA-binding
protein onto a linear double-helix stage. With the power of DNA origami design, we can make several
goniometer variants, each with user-defined tilt and rotation angles of the protein-DNA complex. The
goniometers include asymmetric barcode domains. Thus, we can bind and precisely orient small
DNA-binding proteins, easily identify them on the grid, correctly assign the angle priors, and rapidly
solve their structure. We have validated our approach by obtaining a 6.5-Å structure of an 82-kDa
DNA-binding protein whose helical pseudosymmetry prevents accurate image orientation using
traditional cryo-EM.
We propose to apply our DNA origami molecular goniometers to characterize several biomedically
important DNA-binding proteins of unknown structure that remain recalcitrant to cryo-EM analysis.
We will study nuclear receptors linked to pancreatic and breast cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,
diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We will also study small transcription factors that
regulate pleiotropic drug resistance in yeast. That structural understanding may aid in developing
future antifungal therapies. We will build custom molecular goniometers for each protein target with
the appropriate DNA-binding site and any necessary structural modifications.
We will continue to optimize our first-generation designs to address outstanding challenges related to
sample preparation and extend the devices for general use with non-DNA binding proteins. These
engineering efforts will be aided by computational modeling and simulation tools that our lab has
developed and will adapt for each target system."
10771957,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of 
dementia in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no cure for AD. Drug discovery for AD has 
suffered significant failures, many at late stage clinical trials, partly due to our poor 
understanding of AD pathology and the lack of disease-relevant and human-relevant discovery and 
development models. This calls for team efforts with diverse and complementary expertise to tackle 
the challenges together, by developing innovative approaches from multiple angles to achieve the 
goal of identifying AD drugs.

In this application, we propose three complementary  Specific Aims that together aim to identify 
FDA approved drugs with repurpose potential for AD, from distinct but complementary angles that act 
synergistically to boost the likelihood of success. AD is a highly heritable disease, with an 
estimated heritability of 70%, highlighting the critical role of genetics in understanding  the 
disease etiology. Recent genetic studies have identified over 30 loci, enabling us to dissect the 
genetic architecture of AD, including the biological processes and cell types involved in disease 
etiology. In particular, we aim to dissect the highly polygenic AD etiology into distinct 
pathophysiological components to guide drug repurposing,  which is only feasible in recent years 
thanks to large scale GWAS and massive genomics data available publicly (Aim 1). In parallel, we 
will mine millions of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify drugs that reduce AD risk and 
cognitive decline, by developing phenotyping algorithms from EHR for AD related phenotypes (Aim 2). 
In addition, we will develop a high­ throughput screening (HTS) gene expression profiling assay and 
use human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to identify candidate compounds, and will 
further test the efficacy of the candidates in both patient-derived iPSC lines and AD mouse models 
(Aim 3). The three aims are complementary  and synergistic, in the sense that they independently  
tackle the same problem from drastically distinct angles, while findings from one can be served as 
validation for others. Altogether, leveraging distinct and complementary  expertise, we expect to 
yield bona fide repurposable drugs for AD with orthogonal support."

The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease
epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case
detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to
provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated
individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize
that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners
were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture,
and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an
assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and
reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and
characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the
baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS),
a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening
intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project
will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is
ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms
the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews
(infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases,
health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with
consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy
Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career
development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and
data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and
experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost-
effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5)
presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing
and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully
compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics
in high-risk populations."
10782991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The decreasing cost of genomic sequencing will yield millions of samples in the coming years from both
research and healthcare. Sharing this data is necessary to understand human diseases and eventually help
patients, but doing so requires the community to agree on common methods for collecting, storing, transferring,
accessing, and analyzing data. This proposal will support the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH; www.ga4gh.org) to aid genomic research and human health by developing standards and policies for
effective and responsible data sharing between institutions and countries around the world.
 To advance responsible sharing of global genomic and health-related data, genomics researchers,
clinicians, bioinformaticians, software engineers, and industry experts will work together as a single GA4GH
community to deliver genomic data sharing standards and frameworks (e.g., ontologies, guidelines, technical
schemas). Building on our five years of experience convening stakeholders and developing work products, we
will engage the genomics and health community in the very earliest stages of development to ensure our work
is useful and ready for adoption.
 We will leverage the combined effort of several hundred active contributors to advance development
activities beyond the capacity of our small staff team. These contributors will work within eight GA4GH Work
Streams, each focused on developing critical standards and frameworks, including cloud-based data
federation, scalable schemas and interfaces, data models, and file formats. We will engage deeply within the
broader healthcare, research, and commercial sectors, including the launch of the Genomics in Health
Implementation Forum to drive uptake in the clinical domain.
 A federated ecosystem for searching, discovering, exchanging, and analyzing genomic and clinical data
will enable a global learning health system that advances both research and clinical care beyond their
individual capacities and depends on standards and interoperable frameworks embraced by the entire
community. We envision a future in which the full suite of GA4GH standards enables all clinicians, geneticists,
and researchers to search across the world’s collective genomic data to reveal unanticipated gene-disease
associations, make otherwise impossible drug-response predictions, and generally participate in genomics at a
competitive pace—regardless of their means or location. The promise of genomic medicine lies at a
crossroads that depends on harmonization across the community and will significantly enhance the human
experience if we succeed. We believe that GA4GH is necessary to that success."
10795926,"Project Summary/Abstract
Early blindness results in dramatic neuroplasticity within the human brain; anatomical and functional organization
is altered at almost every level, ranging from neurotransmitter balance to neural function. I plan to combine
psychophysics, computational functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion-weighted MR imaging
(dMRI), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate the anatomical, neural, and computational constraints of
plasticity following early blindness. This proposal is driven by the hypothesis that cortical plasticity resulting from
early blindness may share many of the same underlying mechanisms as ‘neuronal recycling, whereby the
development of novel cortical functions (such as reading in sighted individuals) relies on the ‘recycling’ of
evolutionarily older circuits that originally evolved for different, but similar, functions.
I plan to examine this idea in the context of cross-modal plasticity within the visual motion area hMT+. Area
hMT+, which processes visual motion in sighted individuals, responds selectively to auditory motion in early blind
individuals. In Aim 1, using a combination of dMRI and fMRI, I will examine if the cross-modal responses to
auditory motion within hMT+ in early blind individuals co-localizes with pre-existing anatomical connectivity
between hMT+ and the auditory motion area right planum temporale (rPT). In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis
that auditory motion processing in EB is influenced by the spatiotemporal tuning within hMT+, using a
combination of psychophysics and fMRI. In Aim 2, I will also examine whether the recruitment of hMT+ for
auditory motion processing in early blind individuals results in a loss of sensitivity to auditory motion in rPT.
Finally, in Aim 3, using a combination of psychophysics and fMRI, I will see if auditory motion responses in hMT+
can be explained by a classic model of divisive normalization that has been extensively used to model hMT+
visual motion responses in sighted individuals. By including MRS GABA measurements, I will further test whether
the lower signal to noise associated with auditory rather than visual motion input results in an adaptive reduction
in suppression, mediated by lower GABA concentrations.
The training will focus on computational fMRI, dMRI, and MRS, which will augment my background in
characterizing diverse human perceptual experiences using psychophysics and modeling. My mentors at the
University of Washington (Drs. Ione Fine, Ariel Rokem, and Scott Murray) will provide excellent training in all the
techniques used in this proposal. The award will provide an important opportunity for me to uniquely position
myself in the field as an independent researcher with a strong research program that investigates the
neuroanatomical basis of plasticity following visual deprivation."

10823281,"A longitudinal examination of reward, eating expectancies, and inhibitory control in the progression of
loss of control eating
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Binge eating (BE) is a transdiagnostic symptom of bulimic spectrum disorders, and is associated with weight
gain, obesity, psychosocial impairment, and increased risk for medical comorbidity. Current interventions for
BE are limited in their efficacy, suggesting the need for improved prevention and treatment approaches which
directly target mechanisms of BE onset and maintenance. Theory suggests that positive eating expectancies
(i.e., beliefs about the reinforcing consequences of food consumption) may be a key mechanism relating a
history of reinforcement from eating and risk for BE symptoms. While evidence indicates that eating
expectancies are a robust predictor of BE, limited work has examined the hypothesis that reinforcement history
shapes eating expectancies. Further, evidence suggests that abnormalities in reward processing and inhibitory
control may compound risk for BE, however, no study to date has examined the prospective relationships
between these constructs within a comprehensive theoretical model using multi-modal assessment. Therefore,
the current application seeks to examine an etiological model of BE symptom progression, which incorporates
observed abnormalities in reward processing and inhibitory control within an expectancy-based framework
among individuals demonstrating symptoms of BE (i.e., loss of control eating, LOC) using a longitudinal
design. More specifically, the project will test a moderated mediation model hypothesizing that greater
reinforcement from LOC eating episodes at baseline (i.e., reductions in negative affect and increases in
positive affect as assessed by ecological momentary assessment) will lead to increases in eating expectancies
at 3-month follow-up (i.e., expectancies that eating reduces negative emotions and increases feelings of
pleasantness/reward), which will subsequently lead to increased frequency of LOC eating and progression to
BE at 6-month follow-up. It is further hypothesized that higher reward responsiveness (e.g., reward sensitivity,
preference for immediate rewards) will amplify the relationship between eating reinforcement history and eating
expectancies, while decreased inhibitory control is hypothesized to amplify the relationship between eating
expectancies and BE symptoms. Given this project’s focus on identifying mechanisms of BE symptom
progression, findings from the current project would help to identify malleable maintenance factors for LOC
eating and risk factors for BE, which could be targeted in treatment and prevention efforts."
10823287,"Momentary bio-behavioral predictors of loss of control eating and weight outcomes
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Loss of control (LOC) eating is problematic for individuals with obesity due to its’ negative impact on weight
loss efforts. Despite bariatric surgery being the most effective intervention for weight loss among this
population, LOC eating following surgery has been repeatedly linked to poor weight outcomes. This highlights
the importance of elucidating bio-behavioral mechanisms of LOC eating as an important step in improving
weight outcomes following bariatric surgery. Theoretical and empirical evidence supports self-control (i.e.,
inhibitory control) as the mechanism through which negative affect (NA) prompts LOC eating. While
traditionally measured among populations with eating disorders and obesity using retrospective self-report
questionnaires, this mechanistic process has yet to be examined in real-time in the natural environment of
bariatric surgery patients. Additionally, there is accumulating evidence that low blood glucose (i.e.,
hypoglycemia) may impact the relationship between inhibitory control and LOC eating among this population.
Therefore, the proposed project seeks to test the prospective relationships between NA, inhibitory control,
hypoglycemia, and LOC eating in real-time and examine their collective contribution on longitudinal weight
outcomes post-bariatric surgery. Specifically, this project will test a moderated mediation model hypothesizing
that momentary deficits in inhibitory control will mediate the relationship between NA and LOC eating. Further,
it is hypothesized that hypoglycemia will moderate the effect between inhibitory control and LOC eating.
Collectively, we anticipate that the more frequent and severe LOC eating resulting from the interplay between
negative affect, inhibitory control, and hypoglycemia will then prospectively predict a poorer weight outcome
over the following year. By identifying momentary mechanisms of LOC eating, this research has the potential
to inform treatment intervention efforts aimed at reducing LOC eating post-surgery and promote more optimal
weight outcomes."
10833132,"Project Summary – Imaging and Spectroscopy Core
Imaging is a major driver of discovery and translation in biology and medicine. The use of imaging and
spectroscopic approaches can often provide insights that may not be available with other techniques that require
sample processing. While an Imaging and Spectroscopy Core does not formally exist at the University of
Arkansas, the key ingredients necessary to establish one are already present on campus. A range of optical
microscopy and spectroscopy instruments are already available for use by other investigators, with several of
these set up as service centers. These existing resources will be consolidated and expanded to establish an
Imaging and Spectroscopy Core that will meet the research needs of the proposed Arkansas Integrative
Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC), have long-term benefits for researchers at the University of Arkansas, and
other campuses in the state and in this region of the U.S. The range of technologies available within the Core
will allow project leaders to shed new light on cell and tissue metabolism, thus enabling novel discoveries as well
as clinical translation of such discoveries. Close interaction between the Imaging and Spectroscopy Core and
COBRE project leaders as well as the Data Science and Bioenergetics Cores will lead to new innovations in
research methods that will benefit future COBRE investigators as well as the broader campus research
community. Hands-on training in imaging technologies will be provided to Center members, the campus and
biomedical researchers in Arkansas. The long-term goal of the Imaging Core is to develop and integrate
advanced imaging approaches needed by AIMRC members and become fully independent of COBRE support
by the end of Phase Ill. The short-term goal for COBRE Phase I is to provide state-of-the-art imaging techniques
that can be incorporated into Center projects, develop new image analysis approaches in collaboration with
project leaders and the Data Science Core that will support the long-term goal and provide support/educational
opportunities to Center members. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) Establish a state-of-the-art imaging
and spectroscopy core at the University Arkansas that meets the needs of the COBRE project leaders and
accelerates their progression to independence; 2) Identify and develop new applications of optical microscopy
and spectroscopy on campus that synergize with the Bioenergetics and Data Science Cores and lay the
foundation for long-term sustainability of the Center; and 3) Provide consultation and coordination, technical
assistance and educational opportunities in support of experimental design, sample preparation, data acquisition

Breast cancer is one of the top threats to women’s health. About 1 in 8 US women (~12%) will develop invasive
breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Previous studies have shown the important role of a key
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in breast cancer. A variety of IDH
alternations including somatic mutations, aberrant expression, and altered activities have been observed in
breast cancer patients. Recently, phosphoproteomic studies of breast cancer cells have identified several unique
phosphorylation sites in IDH isoforms, and those sites are specific for different types of breast cancer. Such
heterogeneity poses challenges for effective diagnosis and treatment, so there is a critical need to discover
specific mechanisms of IDH phosphorylation for breast cancer. The overall goal of this project is to identify the
role of IDH phosphorylation in breast cancer. As IDH homologues in bacteria are known to be regulated by
phosphorylation, the hypothesis is that phosphorylation of IDH in human cells alters IDH functions and cellular
metabolism, thus facilitating cancerous transformations. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed:
Aim 1 is to identify the effects of phosphorylation on IDH enzyme functions at the molecular level. Aim 2 is to
identify the influences of IDH phosphorylation on cellular metabolism and redox status at the metabolic level.
Aim 3 is to identify mechanisms or pathways in which IDH phosphorylation plays roles in breast cancer at the
cellular level. The oncogenic transformation test on normal human mammary epithelial cells will be performed to
identify whether IDH phosphorylation is an initiator for breast cancer or a cellular adaption to facilitate cancer
formation. This proposal is innovative because: 1) the functions of IDH phosphorylation in human remain largely
unknown, and this proposal will be the first to systematically study the phosphorylation of all the three IDH
isoforms in human cells; 2) To address the problem that the classic glutamate-substitution method for
phosphorylation studies is not always effective, the genetic code expansion technique will be applied in this
proposal to co-translationally incorporate phosphoamino acid (pAA) at a controlled site in target proteins in order
to produce site-specifically phosphorylated IDH variants which have been identified in breast cancer. This
proposal will be the first to introduce pAA-incorporation systems into human cell lines to study phosphorylation
in living cells. The proposed research is significant because it will provide key evidence for the influences and
roles of IDH phosphorylation in breast cancer. Given that protein phosphorylation is usually involved in signaling
pathways through different kinase cascades, the role of IDH phosphorylation in breast cancer could be different
from other IDH alternations. Ultimately, the proposed studies on IDH phosphorylation are expected to identify
novel biomarker and targets for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment."
10932845,"ABSTRACT
Algorithmic bias is an emerging and highly relevant topic in health policy that draws attention to the idea that
seemingly well-performing predictive algorithms built using biased data can propagate systemic biases and
disparities existing in clinical practice. Our primary goal in the parent grant was to innovatively use machine
learning based risk prediction and value-of-information methodology to develop a personalized risk-adaptive
surveillance (PRAISE) framework and assess its impact on outcomes, including costs, time to recurrence and
survival, for colorectal cancer survivors who have been treated for their primary cancer and are under
surveillance for recurrence. Decision-making in the PRAISE framework is driven by dynamic risk predictions for
recurrence, which identify high-risk patients to target for more frequent surveillance testing. However, potential
sources of racial/ethnic disparities along the cancer care continuum from diagnosis to survivorship can lead to
distorted risk predictions during surveillance. Using distorted risk predictions can have implications for
decision-making, potentially propagating and exacerbating biases that exist in clinical practice and resulting in
poorer outcomes for certain subgroups. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand and
address algorithmic bias in the PRAISE framework. Specifically, we will first characterize heterogeneity in
current practice with respect to surveillance testing patterns, recurrence detection and survival across
racial/ethnic subgroups for patients diagnosed with and treated for colorectal cancer (Aim 1). This will help us
better understand the sources of bias in our data and will better inform our approach in Aim 2, where we will
use emerging and novel methods to mitigate racial/ethnic bias in our previously developed dynamic risk
prediction model for colorectal cancer recurrence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop an outcomes-based
framework to assess the implications of using a biased versus a bias-corrected risk prediction model to guide
surveillance testing among colorectal cancer survivors, specifically through their effect on decision-making and
subgroup-specific health and cost outcomes. This important work will motivate the use of new methods for
addressing bias in risk prediction models in cancer and other clinical areas."
10744230,"Infections with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted
infection in the US. These infections cause an estimated 5% of cancers worldwide.
HPV infects the basal keratinocytes of differentiating epithelial tissues. Importantly, only persistent
HPV infections are responsible for cancer. Thus, understanding the virus-host interplay that
influences viral persistence has important implications for HPV biology and human cancers.
We used a single-cell genomics approach to identify protein arginine N-methyltransferase 1
(PRMT1) as an important factor for persistence of viral infection within primary human cervical
cells. We demonstrate that PRMT1 inhibition increases the deposition of m6A marks on HPV18
viral mRNA, specifically to intronic regions, resulting in overall dysregulated splicing of the viral
genes. We hypothesize that PRMT1 regulates RBM15 controlled m6a deposition on viral mRNA
to regulate alternative splicing during persistent infection. PRMTs have recently emerged as
molecular targets for anticancer drug development. Although many candidates are still in the
preclinical stage, some inhibitors have entered clinical trials. The basic research in this project
determines if PRMT inhibitors could have translational use for HPV infections and tumors."

 Identifying accessible tumor antigens that are not expressed in vital organs would allow genetic
engineering of CAR T cells to avoid dysfunction at tumor beds. We have identified an olfactory receptor (OR)
expressed in a variety of human tumors, ranging from ~70% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and 39% of
prostate cancers, to ~10% of NSCLCs, and generated CAR T cells that specifically target its extracellular domain.
The long-term goal of these studies is to translate these CAR T cells. Here, we will advance the preclinical work
needed to apply for IND approval for a first-in-human clinical trial conducted at Moffitt, using OR2H1 CAR T cells
generated in our Cell Therapy Facility under GMP conditions. Our central hypothesis is that genetically
engineered OR2H1 CAR T cells can effectively control the progression of established tumors of different
histologies, without the unacceptable on-target, off-tumor effects of other targets expressed in vital tissues.
In Specific Aim 1, we will demonstrate the effectiveness and specificity of targeting OR2H1+ PDX with
CAR T cells in vivo. These studies will support a rationale for subsequent IND approval for OR2H1 CAR T cell
administration in patients with tumors expressing OR2H1 at variable levels.
 In Specific Aim 2, we will define the superiority of XBP1-ablated OR2H1 CAR T cells. These studies will
support a rationale for genetic engineering of OR2H1 CAR T cells, to empower them to resist metabolic
restrictions and inhibitory signals at tumor beds.
In Specific Aim 3, we will optimize a method to identify eligible patients for OR2H1 CAR T cell targeting.
 Our work could exert a profound effect in the field by supporting a first-in-human clinical trial using OR2H1-
targeted CAR T cells against a variety of solid human tumors, which could have significant benefits in a broad
range of cancer patients, with limited or negligible toxicity."
10758961,"ABSTRACT
The racial disparity in breast cancer survival rates has largely been attributed to late-stage diagnoses and
increased incidence of triple negative breast cancer in African American (AA) compared to non-Hispanic White
(white) women. However, the latest statistics indicate that more than 50% of tumors in AA women are estrogen
receptor positive (ER+). ER+ tumors are considered less aggressive and are typically treated effectively with
endocrine therapies that target ER activity (i.e. tamoxifen) or estrogen production (i.e. aromatase inhibitors).
Despite a generally favorable prognosis for women with ER+ breast cancer, AA women still have a greater risk
than white women of dying from ER+ disease. We have found that AA women in the Chicago area have a 4 to
5-fold greater risk of death from ER+ breast cancer than white women, even after controlling for stage at
diagnosis, treatment, and other known prognostic factors. This finding implies that biologic mechanisms are
activated in ER+ breast cancer from AA women, resulting in resistance to endocrine therapy and a greater risk
of relapse and death. Our overarching goal is to identify biological and molecular mechanisms contributing to
the racial survival disparity in ER+ breast cancer patients. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of
SQLE (squalene epoxidase), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sterols, cholesterol, and oxysterols, as a
potential driver of poor outcome in AA women with ER+ tumors. We hypothesize that elevated SQLE in ER+
tumors of AA women leads to an accumulation of biologically active sterols that function to promote tumor cell
proliferation and survival. Mechanistically, we expect these sterols to function by altering ER activity and reducing
responsiveness to endocrine therapies. To investigate this, we propose 3 aims: 1) to define the mechanism by
which SQLE is up-regulated in ER+ breast tumors in AA women; 2) to identify SQLE-regulated sterols that are
associated with race in ER+ breast tumors, and 3) to assess the cellular function and therapeutic potential of
SQLE in ER+ tumors of AA women. To accomplish these aims, we will utilize newly generated tumor collections
and novel preclinical models from AA women, as well as an innovative method we developed to detect and
analyze multiple sterol species. Overall, we expect to establish SQLE as a critical player in the racial disparity
observed in survival of patients with ER+ breast cancer. Importantly, we expect to uncover two new mechanisms
that may explain i) how SQLE contributes to early relapse and ii) why SQLE expression is elevated in ER+
tumors of AA women. Ultimately, this work has the potential to increase health equity by improving survival for
AA women with ER+ breast cancer through the development of novel preventive and treatment strategies that
target underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to disparate outcomes."

cardiovascular disease. African Americans have also not been included in many cardiovascular studies, raising
the possibility that some results may not be applicable to them. Compounding these issues is the fact that
traditional genetic analyses are not designed to account for the relatively complex genetic makeup that African
Americans have, due to their African ancestry and admixture with other populations. This project aims to
identify the circulating metabolites that are associated with coronary heart disease, investigate the portions of
the genome that are of African continental origin, and use this correlation to identify specific genes that are
associated both with African ancestry and coronary heart disease. Through intensive laboratory and didactic
training in metabolomics and genetics, Dr. Cruz will harness the resources of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center, Harvard Medical School, and associated institutions to examine a disease of significant societal
impact. Situated in a multi-disciplinary laboratory, Dr. Cruz will take advantage of novel metabolomic
technologies and novel genetic analytical strategies to better decipher how genetic ancestry influences levels
of circulating metabolites. He will use admixture mapping techniques, which take into account the
heterogeneous genomic make up of African Americans, to better understand how the unique genomic
structure of recently admixed populations may influence baseline circulating levels of metabolites. Using
plasma samples from African American participants of the Jackson Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis, metabolomics will be used to measure levels of circulating metabolites and assess which
metabolites are associated with incident coronary heart disease, with over 15 years of follow up. Clinical traits
associated with coronary heart disease like, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia will also be
analyzed. Using admixture mapping, regions of potential association between the metabolites of interest and
African ancestry in the genome will be identified, allowing for higher power in identifying specific associated
variants in those regions. As precision medicine offers the promise of more personalized care, it is incumbent
on the biomedical research community to take into account the unique genetic makeup of all members of
society. This project aims to offer specific pathophysiologic information for a historically understudied group of
people. Ultimately Dr. Cruz intends on using his research efforts to provide better medical care to understudied
and underserved populations, and in turn improve the health of society as a whole."
10754951,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 1 million Americans require mechanical ventilation each year and mortality estimates range from 30-35%
with significant variability at the patient, hospital, and regional level. More recently, physicians were found to be
associated with mortality in mechanically ventilated patients, adding yet another level of variation. There is little
research as to what individual physicians do to cause this variation in outcomes and whether provider practice
patterns can be modified to improve outcomes. To date, morbidity and mortality reduction interventions in this
population involve ventilation strategies and harm reduction therapies. Despite these interventions being
evidence-based and guideline-supported, their use remains highly variable. The potential link between
provider-level variability in mortality and population-level variation in evidence-based practice represents a
critical knowledge gap. Specifically, there is a need to understand how physicians’ adherence to evidence-
based practices vary, the degree to which this results in harm, and what barriers are modifying practice
patterns. The candidate's prior work developed a method, using electronic health record metadata, to assign a
provider retrospectively and reliably to each patient for each intensive care day. Using these data, provider-
level adherence to low tidal volume ventilation strategies significantly varied across a 12-hospital health
system. This Career Development Award builds from that work and seeks to achieve three aims, that together,
will promote the candidate's long-term goal of developing and testing strategies to increase adherence to
evidence-based care and improve acute respiratory failure survivors' outcomes. Specifically, in this award, the
candidate seeks to (1) quantify variation among physicians in adherence to evidence-based practices, (2)
generate hypotheses about barriers and facilitators to evidence-based practice adherence, and (3) develop and
pilot an intervention targeting barriers to evidence-based care. To complete these aims the candidate will
perform a retrospective cohort study (Aim 1), perform a mixed-method study enrolling 40 ward-based
physicians that care for mechanically ventilated patients (Aim 2), and use an intervention mapping framework to
develop and pilot an intervention targeting barriers to low tidal volume ventilation. The hands-on experience he
will acquire in completing these three studies using different methods will be complemented by carefully
selected didactic coursework and structured mentoring by senior investigators from multiple disciplines. This
work will lead to pilot grants and R01 to support a randomized clinical trial of this intervention. Completing this
research will build upon the candidate’s past training and will provide him with the protected time and
experience to achieve his career goal of becoming a leading, independently funded outcomes researcher
focused on conducting studies within learning health systems to improve outcomes among survivors of ARF
and other critical illnesses."

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-associated condition defined by the expansion
of hematopoietic cells that harbor mutations commonly found in leukemia, in the absence of hematological
malignancies or related pathologies. CHIP is highly prevalent in the aging community, with about 10-30% of
individuals over the age of 70 acquiring the condition, and is associated with an increased mortality rate among
the elderly. Surprisingly, this increased mortality rate is largely driven by an elevated risk of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). CHIP carriers have been found to have a 2-fold increased risk of myocardial
infarction, stroke, and heart failure. Murine studies have shown a causal association of CHIP with ASCVD, largely
by upregulating proinflammatory pathways in pathogenic macrophages. Though the use of mouse models has
allowed us to gain insight into important mechanisms involving CHIP, there are aspects of human physiology
that are not captured in a murine system. This study will utilize a tractable, human primary model of functional
CHIP macrophages, along with humanized mouse models to study the pathological features of CHIP-related
atherosclerosis.
The objective of this proposed study is to determine what mechanisms in human cells are important in CHIP-
related ASCVD. The overall hypothesis of this study is that CHIP-related mutations will increase key inflammatory
signaling pathways in human myeloid cells that may not necessarily be conserved in mice, contributing to
exacerbation of cardiovascular disease. The aims addressed in this proposal are: 1) to determine the
transcriptional changes in primary human macrophages under proinflammatory activation, 2) to determine the
mechanisms mediating the protective effect of an IL6R variant for CHIP associated CVD in primary human
macrophages, and 3) to determine phenotypic changes of macrophages in a chronic inflammation model of
clonal hematopoiesis in a humanized murine in vivo system. The use of a primary human macrophage model of
CHIP will bridge the gap in knowledge between what has been observed clinically versus what has been
observed in murine models of CHIP. Work for this proposal may suggest suitable targets for pharmaceutical
intervention."
10755365,"Abstract. Over 70 percent of older adults aged 65 or older require assistance from caregivers with basic
functions at some point in their lifetime, and more than six million older adults in the US have Alzheimer’s disease
and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) and require more extensive assistance than their
counterparts without AD/ADRD. About one-third of older adults who require assistance receive help from formal
providers at home or an institution. These formal long-term care (LTC) providers have low and stagnant wages
with few benefits, which have resulted in a severe shortage of and a high turnover rate for formal care providers.
The situation is particularly dire for low-income formal caregivers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a tax
credit for low- and moderate-income working families and is one of the largest and most effective anti-poverty
programs in the US. The EITC could impact care for older adults because it encourages work, supplements
incomes, and improves physical and mental health and overall wellbeing for persons with low incomes. However,
despite a vast literature on the EITC, little is known about its effects on formal care for older adults. We propose
to fill this knowledge gap by leveraging a large number of plausibly exogeneous policy changes in the EITC at
the federal and state levels in the past two decades and using difference-in-differences and event-study
approaches and large, nationally representative data sets (Health and Retirement Study and Current Population
Survey) to examine the effects of the EITC on formal care provision and utilization along several important
dimensions including the care recipients’ AD/ADRD status. Specifically, we will pursue the following aims: Aim
#1: We will test how the EITC has changed the supply of formal LTC for those most likely to be affected by the
EITC—low-income individuals aged 18-64—using the Current Population Survey. Aim #2: We will test how the
EITC has changed older adults’ utilization of and out-of-pocket expenditures on formal LTC, including home and
institutional care, using the public and restricted data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Aim #3
(exploratory): Depending on the findings from the first two aims, we will examine whether estimated changes in
formal LTC lead to changes in the intensity and type of informal care utilized by older adults using the HRS data,
given that formal and informal LTC could be substitutes or complements for older adults. This study directly
addresses the goal of the National Institute on Aging to “Find significantly improved and cost-effective ways to
reduce caregiver, family, and patient stress and improve older adults’ ability to cope with chronic disease”.
Findings from this study will have significant policy implications, as the size and the life expectancy of the older
adult population, especially the population with AD/ADRD, and the costs of health care continue to rise, putting
unprecedented pressure on the health care system. We will also provide valuable information to policymakers
interested in designing effective population-level policies to support health care workers, especially the most
vulnerable low-income health care workers.

Cataracts, a clouding of the natural lens, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, with a projected 40M
cases by 2050. Underrepresented groups and medically underserved populations are disproportionately
impacted by cataracts. Clinical treatment is limited to surgical removal of the cataractous lens, and
implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). Unfortunately, the IOL is highly susceptible to growth from residual
lens epithelial cells (LECs), a complication known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO) that occurs in
~40% of adult IOL patients. Laser capsulotomy surgery is used to treat PCO, but has significant potential side
effects. The proposed work will lead to the development of “LEC-resistant IOLs” based on a new amphiphilic
silicone, reducing the incidence of PCO and the need for a 2nd surgery (laser capsulotomy). This work is
significant given not only the expected exceptional LEC-resistance and retention of desired opto-mechanical
properties of the proposed IOLs (supported by preliminary data), but also that it relies on a strategy readily
integrated into existing IOL materials, designs, and manufacturing processes. Diphenyl silicones are used to
prepare foldable IOLs, wherein the elastomeric nature provides the ability to fold the IOL upon implantation
such that the incision size may be reduced. In this work, new amphiphilic surface-modifying additives (SMAs)
[developed by the PI], comprised of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) segment and siloxane tether, will be readily
blended into an IOL-type diphenyl silicone. These SMAs uniquely afford rapid and substantial migration to the
aqueous/biological interface to produce LEC-resistance, without impacting opto-mechanical properties. The
innovation of this work rests not only in the novelty of the PI-developed SMAs, but in the departure from
other strategies that have attempted to produce IOLs with resistance to LEC growth (e.g., change to IOL
geometric design, complex surface treatment, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing modifiers). The
approach to accomplish this work relies on a systematic and robust methods, and will be led by a team of
skilled experts. In Aim 1 [led by Grunlan, PI], silicone formulations will be prepared with SMAs of varying
structure and concentration in the diphenyl silicone, key material properties assessed, and IOLs prepared
from formulations meeting success criteria. In Aim 2 [led by Chandler, Co-I] select formulations will be
evaluated for resistance to LEC growth, and select IOLs assessed ex vivo in rabbit and human eyes with a
commercial silicone IOL used as a control. Following iterations of Aim 1 and 2, in Aim 3 [led by Scott, Co-I),
a SMA-modified IOL will be evaluated in a rabbit model, and biocompatibility and resistance to LEC growth
compared to the commercial IOL. The clinical consultant, Dr. Lee, M.D. (a comprehensive ophthalmologist
and ocular pathologist) will provide guidance to these studies."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a universally disabling and fatal neurological condition.
Current treatments have only modest benefit. Development of effective therapeutics is
hampered in part by inadequate knowledge of ALS natural history. Though valuable, existing
ALS registries have either large samples sizes but limited clinical information, focus on relatively
small subsets of the ALS population, or provide information from a relatively brief period.
However, as a part of routine clinical care, ALS multidisciplinary clinics (MDCs) develop a rich
natural history dataset from all ALS patients, and most people living with ALS are seen at
MDCs. We have built a combined, de-identified natural history dataset from over 1,700 ALS
patients from 9 MDCs, with racial representation that is reflective of the ALS population at large
and broad geographic representation as well. We offer enrollment to all patients at our clinics.
We will build on our multicenter, longitudinal, prospective MDC dataset in collaboration with
industry and the ALS patient community to provide information critical for clinical trial
development and post-marketing evaluation. Specifically, we will do the following: record
clinically relevant baseline characteristics and serum neurofilament light (NfL) measurements at
enrollment as well as validated longitudinal measures of disease progression including
ALSFRS-R and disease staging, respiratory vital capacity, speaking rate and 10 meter walk test
(Aim 1), record disease milestones based upon patient-reported outcomes, durable medical
equipment orders in the electronic health record, and other events such as dates of
gastrostomy, hospitalizations, and death (Aim 2), and model time to events using baseline
characteristics as well as retrospective and prospective longitudinal data (Aim 3). We have
demonstrated the ability to enroll the vast majority of patients seeking care in our clinics so as to
best represent the ALS population. Baseline characteristics will include ALS phenotype and
results of genetic testing. Datasets will be made available to academic and industry
investigators to advance ALS care, drug development, and outcomes research. We will expand
existing engagement from industry and other stakeholders to include an advisory panel of
people living with ALS and will encourage opportunities for data dissemination through these
existing relationships and publications."

During cardiac development, coordinate gene expression changes facilitate the progressive lineage restriction
of multipotent progenitors into a terminal identity that is maintained over their lifespan. Compromised
differentiation and/or cell state have been linked to multiple diseases, including aspects of congenital heart
disease and heart failure. Thus, the mechanisms underlying cellular identity are of intense interest. Models
underlying fate determination and the identity often focus on transcription factors and/or niche signals. Current
paradigms fail to reconcile how the interplay between a finite number of morphogens and lineage specific
transcription factors result in 200+ cell types with distinct and stable identities. I hypothesize that nuclear
architecture represents a critical mechanism for achieving coordinated regulation of hundreds of genes
underlying cellular identity by governing their accessibility or availability. Supporting our hypothesis, we have
built a strong body of work demonstrating that nuclear architecture regulates cardiac cellular identity in
development and disease. First, we discovered mechanisms by which critical transcription factors not only
govern transcription, but also choreograph genome folding to regulate cardiac neural crest fate determination.
Second, our work shows that spatial positioning of chromatin safeguards cardiac cellular identity and likely
contributes to human cardiac disease (i.e. laminopathies). Decades of work have shown that gene expression
programs are regulated by the recruitment and activity of activator and opposing repressor proteins. In addition
to revolutionizing our understanding of transcription, this work has led to therapies directly targeting transcription
factors. The mechanisms that similarly balance formation, maintenance and dissolution of nuclear architecture
are poorly understood. In the EIA application I outline an interdisciplinary vision to uncover how these
mechanisms control cardiac cellular identity. In Theme 1, I propose strategies to identify and decipher how
molecular players guiding establishment, maintenance and disassembly of genome folding impact cardiac cell
state. In Theme 2, I propose strategies to uncover how epigenetic, transcriptional, and mechanical inputs
regulate spatial positioning of the genome in relation to the nuclear lamina in physiologic and pathologic
conditions. We have established a multipronged program that will use high throughput 3D imaging, genetic
manipulations with precise spatiotemporal resolution, tunable cardiac microtissues, epigenome engineering,
super-resolution imaging and state-of-the-art genomics to tackle the propose studies, with a focus grounded in
physiological relevance. The orthogonal approaches promote rigor, but require flexibility. My strong track record
of building an impactful body of work support our pursuit of this paradigm shifting work. The proposed studies
have the potential to reshape our understanding of how epigenetics, transcriptional, and mechano-related
mechanisms direct 3D genome organization and orchestrate cardiac cellular identity. By viewing cardiac
diseases through the prism of genome organization, we predict a wealth of unrealized therapeutic opportunities."

Yale-murine TMC (mTMC), through application of high-content and high throughput single-cell and spatial omics
technologies, we aim to accelerate the discovery of senescent biomarkers, apply them to mouse models, and
generate hypotheses to test mechanisms of organismal aging. Our proposed unbiased analyses will also answer
the question whether senescent cells (stromal or hematopoietic lineage) exist in sufficient quantities to alter the
inflammatory landscape and biology. Yale-mTMC will use lineage-marked mouse to classify types or subtypes
of senescent cells, their spatial heterogeneity and how these cells impact the tissue environments. Yale-mTMC
will assemble 1) a multidisciplinary team to generate the molecular and cellular maps of cellular senescence in
Thymus, Bone marrow, Spleen, PBMCs, Mesenteric and Inguinal adipose tissue. 2) develop and deploy a suite
of high-resolution, high-content and high throughput single-cell and spatial omics technologies to characterize
these specimens and 3) perform integrated informatics to identify biomarkers of senescent cell heterogeneity
and to construct comprehensive molecular and cellular maps of cellular senescence and including an i.v CD45
antibody labeling/sorting approach to study tissue resident immune cells in non-lymphoid tissues. We will utilize
the analysis platforms established through the Yale human TMC to enable cross-species verification of
biomarkers. Three major biological analysis pipelines are: (A) Multiplex Imaging (MI) including CODEX, IMC,
and SMI, complemented by 3D light sheet microscopy of cleared tissues, (B) Single Cell Analysis (SCA) including
scCITE-seq for protein and mRNA profiling, CyTOF for high-plex immunophenotyping, and single-cell protein
secretome profiling to measure SASP heterogeneity, and (C) Spatial Multi-Omics Sequencing (SMOS) using
DBiT-based spatial-CITE-seq for spatially resolved proteo-transcriptomic mapping at genome scale. The
combination of these pipelines allows for highly sensitive and single-cell resolution mapping of senescent cells
and associated tissue environments. Yale-mTMC aims to assemble a multidisciplinary team led by PI: Dixit
(Director, Yale Center for Research on Aging), and MPI: Montgomery (Immunologist, Associate Dean for
scientific affairs) with Core Leads Dr. Fan (Bioengineer), Dr. Kluger (informatics and data analytics) and Key
personnel Dr. Booth (mouse pathologist), Dr. Lucas, Haberman (Immunologists, expert in pet store mouse model,
imaging) with IAB composed of scientific leaders Drs. Medzhitov, Iwasaki and Ruddle. We have experience in
management of large, multi-component programs and prior experience with generating significant high-quality
imaging and omics data as part of a consortium. A dedicated program manager will manage and coordinate all
activities across the center and with the SenNet consortium. Complementary and multidisciplinary scientific
expertise of the team will translate into the collective capability of the TMC to foster integration of multi-
dimensional, multiparameter data generation and coordination with SenNet and other TMCs for greater impact"

10720892,"Sepsis remains the leading cause of hospital mortality today. Despite its increasing incidence due to an aging
population with greater comorbidities, in-hospital mortality from sepsis has significantly declined over the past
decade. This decline in mortality is due in large part to earlier recognition and better compliance with best
practices in early sepsis management. Despite decreased in-hospital mortality, a large fraction (up to 50% in
some studies) of sepsis survivors never fully recover and develop chronic critical illness – characterized by
persistent immune suppression, recurrent infections, sepsis recidivism, and poor long-term outcomes.
The applicant of this BLRD Merit Review Research Career Scientist (RCS) Award is Thomas S. Griffith, Ph.D.,
a Research Health Science Specialist at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS) currently
supported by two VA Merit Awards (I01 BX001324-10 and I01 BX001324-01). Dr. Griffith is also a Professor
(with tenure) in the Department of Urology at the University of Minnesota, serving as PI on two NIH grants
(1R35 GM140881-01 and 1R21 AI154527-01) and co-investigator on a third NIH grant (1R01 CA260825-01).
Over the past 12 years, the applicant’s laboratory has been investigating sepsis-induced immune suppression
using a combination of multiple preclinical models and human samples. Current preclinical research activities
in the applicant’s laboratory leverage a novel mouse model that mimics a critical aspect of human biology –
exposure to multiple ongoing and resolved infections to train the immune system for robust responses to new
pathogens. Environmental pathogen exposure is one important difference between basic human and
laboratory mouse biology that must be considered when using mice to evaluate immune system fitness.
Humans are naturally exposed to both commensal and pathogenic microbes daily from birth, and the immune
system of adult humans has been trained and shaped by each infection and vaccination experienced. While
specific pathogen-free (SPF) housing of laboratory mice has been instrumental in increasing experimental
reproducibility, it has simultaneously further distanced the mouse as a model from humans largely because
SPF mice live their lives with limited microbial exposure.
Thus, the over-arching goal of the research performed in Dr. Griffith’s laboratory is to study how changing the
“starting point” of the immune system (i.e., mature, adult-like immune system of ‘dirty’ mice that have
experienced physiological microbial exposure vs. naïve, neonate-like immune system of SPF mice) influences
the magnitude of the acute innate immune response to a septic event. Moreover, the work being done may
also help to address the important fact that there is a lack of successful treatments for humans with sepsis.
Over 100 agents (many targeting cytokines) with preclinical efficacy in mouse models of sepsis have been
unsuccessful in humans, making it tempting to speculate the exclusive use of SPF mice in previous preclinical
studies may have underestimated the magnitude of the sepsis-induced cytokine storm and/or pathophysiology.
It is expected that comparing the extent of immune dysfunction during sepsis in microbially-experienced ‘dirty’
mice to human samples will help to validate the clinical relevance of this novel mouse model that mimics this
critical aspect of human biology – exposure to multiple infectious pathogens that generates an experienced
immune system – to serve as an important addition to the preclinical toolbox for studying sepsis. An key
component of the work performed is the expectation of making the research discoveries available to other
researchers and clinicians to help inform the development and testing of new treatment options to improve the
health needs of our nation’s Veterans who have experienced a septic event. It is the applicant’s goal to use this
RCS award to help him put the applicant’s laboratory in the position to continue this trajectory towards clinical
translation of important insights in sepsis pathophysiology gained from basic biomedical research."

10766151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding how co-morbidities in persons with HIV (PWH) such as substance use affect risk-taking, decision-
making, and other cognitive behaviors is important given implications for everyday functioning and transmission
risk. The high prevalence of cannabis use in PWH, medicinally and recreationally, may indicate disease severity,
impart therapeutic benefits, or adverse consequences. In fact, cannabis is recommended to those with HIV to
alleviate nausea, improve appetite, relieve pain, and lift mood. To-date, the consequences of cannabis use in
PWH remain unclear as do potential interactions with HIV treatments. In healthy participants, heavy cannabis
use is associated with cognitive deficits e.g., risky decision-making, response disinhibition and inattention, but
pro-cognitive effects in PWH may exist at mild use levels due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic
properties. Furthermore, little has been done to determine the effects of cannabis use on the endocannabinoid
(EC) system in general or in PWH. This area of study is especially germane to cognition since the virus affects
brain regions rich in ECs. CNS relevance is of particular importance given that the EC system exerts regulatory
effects over the dopaminergic system, critical for these cognitive processes. This application will utilize a cross-
species approach to delineate the effects EC system activation has on HIV-relevant cognitive and motivational
domains. Animal studies enable mechanistic insights on chronic and withdrawal effects in this system. Both
behavioral and mechanistic overlap will occur between the human and animal studies. Specific Aim 1 will
determine the effects of the two primary cannabis constituents (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], cannabidiol
[CBD]) vs. placebo on risky decision-making, response inhibition, reward learning, temporal perception, and
motivation, plus EC and homovanillic acid (HVA; a surrogate for dopamine activity) levels in HIV+ and HIV-
subjects. Participants with infrequent cannabis use will undergo baseline cognitive testing and biomarker assays
with antiretrovirals (ART) use quantified. They will be randomized to a 5-day course of either THC, CBD, or
placebo and return for follow-up testing and re-assaying of ECs and HVA levels. Specific Aim 2 will conduct
parallel experiments in a rodent model of HIV on acute, chronic, and withdrawal effects of 2 doses of THC vs. 2
doses of CBD, plus combined THC/CBD/ART (dolutegravir) on the same cognitive and motivational tests, plus
EC and HVA levels to provide directionality and potential interaction of drug effects. Each experiment will train
and test HIV-1 transgenic and wildtype littermate rats on cross-species versions of tasks used in Aim 1. Rats will
be tested at baseline, immediately after acute, then chronic treatment, then during withdrawal. The brains of rats
will be harvested and assessed for EC and dopamine receptor levels to determine potential mechanisms of the
beneficial/negative effects of cannabinoid treatments on symptoms related to HIV. Disentangling the cognitive
and biological effects of THC and CBD and their relation with ART is a much-needed advance in the HIV field
and will inform development of therapeutics and policy advice for co-morbid substance use."
10816448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the most common type of birth defect and impact about 1% of the popu-
lation worldwide. Among CHDs, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), in which the left ventricle that pumps
oxygenated blood to most of the body is malformed, is the most dangerous form and the most common cause
of death in infants with CHDs. To achieve early diagnosis and intervention of the disease, the long-term goal is
to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HLHS. Although HLHS is evidently a genetic disease,
little is known about the genetic mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying the disease. One major reason for
such a knowledge gap is the lack of animal models replicating this human disease. Preliminary work from the
lab suggests that frog may represent a valuable animal model for studying HLHS. The loss of transcription factor
Ets1 in frog leads to an HLHS-like phenotype, with thickened ventricular wall and reduced chamber volume.
Genetic deletion of Ets1 in mice, however, leads to ventricular septal defects and double outlet right ventricle,
but not HLHS, suggesting the involvement of additional factors in the pathological development of the disease.
Therefore, the goal of this project is to use the frog model to identify genetic causes for HLHS. To determine
additional genes involved in HLHS and better understand how different structural changes in the heart correlate
to cardiac function, an efficient functional screen is needed. Currently, there is no imaging tool that can continu-
ously observe the entire beating embryonic frog heart in vivo with a high spatiotemporal resolution, making the
direct analysis of cardiac function impossible. To address this challenge, the first aim will be developing a fast-
speed, volumetric light-field microscopy tool that exhibits high specificity and sensitivity yet low photodamage to
enable in vivo examination of heart function in developing embryos. With this platform, the second aim will be
examining heart anatomy as well as heart function in frog embryos when candidate HLHS-related genes are
mutated. Combining advanced imaging technology and quantitative analysis, this study will lead to the efficient
discovery of critical genes involved in heart development and the structure-function relations between genetic
components and pathophysiological phenotypes, laying the foundation to uncover the etiology of HLHS. This
novel conceptual and methodological groundwork will also be valuable in broader basic and translational cardiac
research."
10834115,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Studies critically examining the cost-benefit of electronic cigarette (EC) flavors on smoking are urgently needed
as FDA is making sweeping and impactful regulatory decisions without this important information. Surprisingly,
no independent, long-term, randomized clinical trial has experimentally examined the impact of non-tobacco
flavored vs. tobacco flavored ECs on product uptake, sustained use, and complete switching. While the National
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that ECs are likely to be far less harmful than
combustible cigarettes, more than 1 million EC products have been banned since 2020, significantly narrowing
the marketplace. According to the US FDA, a key reason for the removal of these products was the significant
rise in youth vaping, often with flavored ECs. Indeed, the FDA decisions cited a failure of manufacturers to
provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that the benefits to adult smokers outweighed the “documented risks
to youth,” suggesting that the significant rise in youth vaping significantly tipped the scales a priori in the direction
of restricting EC flavors. The current restricted legal EC marketplace may reduce youth vaping but may
inadvertently reduce the ability of ECs to compete successfully with conventional cigarettes, reducing adult
smokers’ trial and use of e-cigarettes for switching. FDA requires more robust and definitive studies evaluating
the benefit of EC flavors, if any, to adult smokers. To provide the needed scientific evidence, we propose a
nationwide randomized clinical trial to determine the impact of EC flavors on 1) product uptake and appeal, 2)
cigarette craving, symptoms, and dependence, and 3) smoking behavior, including sustained and complete
switching from cigarettes to ECs. We will also utilize combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patch and
lozenge) as an FDA-approved comparator to determine the potential increased benefit (or not) of EC vs NRT on
tobacco use behavior. Smokers (N=1,500) will be randomized to a) preferred flavor EC (PEC); b) tobacco flavor
EC (TEC); or c) combination NRT. Products will be provided at no cost for 14 weeks (2-week trial before switch
date, 12 weeks of use following switch date). PEC participants will be provided their preferred flavor(s) and able
to change flavors throughout the 14 weeks. Changes in smoking will be biochemically confirmed via remote
exhaled carbon monoxide reading at 12 weeks (end of product provision) and 26 weeks after the switch date.
This significant and innovative study will be the first to provide the FDA with critical and definitive information as
to the impact of EC flavors on tobacco use among adult smokers. With expertise conducting nationwide, large-
scale EC and NRT trial research, our team is uniquely suited to conduct this investigation. If our study
demonstrates no significant improvements in switching with flavored EC use, then the continued sale of these
products is likely indefensible; however, if improvements are significant, these findings will provide a critical
counterweight to the current FDA regulations and aid future decision making."
10794945,"Obesity is a multifactorial disease which results from complex interactions among multiple genes, behaviors, and environmental factors. A heightened genetic risk does not always translate to the development of obesity among children, which points to the presence of risk-modifying factors that likely relate to energy balance behaviors as key behavioral drivers. This study will build on our prior research to comprehensively examine the interplay between genotype and phenotype and, for the first time, systematically assess if energy balance behaviors in the context of the family environment, alone or in combination, can modify behavioral and genetic predispositions to childhood obesity. Specifically, this research aims to prospectively evaluate the extent to which associations of a heightened drive to eat (HDE) on 1-year changes in weight and adiposity outcomes are independent or additive to those of a genetic risk for obesity among children, ages 5 to 7, from families with low resource backgrounds. HED will be conceptualized as a broader behavioral phenotype which combines hyperphagic appetitive traits (i.e., the relative reinforcing value of food, a rapid eating rate, and eating in the absence of hunger). Children’s genotype will be assessed using a genetic risk score (GRS), which serves as an aggregate measure from multiple obesity risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, the study aims to prospectively examine risk-modifying energy balance behaviors in areas of diet, physical activity, and sleep that may mitigate the detrimental impact of a HDE or high genetic risk on weight and adiposity outcomes and test whether these factors differ for HDE versus a high genetic risk of obesity on those outcomes. Lastly, the research aims to examine the impact of family-level influences in areas of family functioning and parent feeding on risk-modifying energy balance behaviors in children. Primary outcomes will include 1-year changes in children’s body mass index (BMI) z-score, percent body fat, and waist circumference. Identifying behavioral and family factors that may mitigate the impact of obesity risk on weight and adiposity outcomes is critical for moving the prevention of childhood obesity into a new direction. If successful, the knowledge gleaned from this research will offer new and powerful targets for addressing health disparities in obesity and formulating tailored family-based interventions in the fight against childhood obesity."
10771952,"Dementia affects over 44 million adults worldwide, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias
(ADRD) account for 60%-80% of all cases among older adults. Physical disability is often the final
consequence of ADRD before death. One-third of dementia cases may be attributable to modifiable factors,
and due to unclear benefit of AD treatments, there is a need to identify intervention targets to prevent ADRD
and physical disability. Since both conditions may be preceded by poor cognitive and physical performance by
over a decade, shared biological determinants of dual cognitive-physical decline that impact neurological and
musculoskeletal systems may predict and inform therapeutic targets to prevent ADRD and physical disability.
The geroscience hypothesis posits that targeting the biology of aging may better impact human health, such as
prevention of ADRD and physical disability, than targeting specific diseases. Indeed, parallel lines of research
indicate that biomarkers reflecting the underlying biology of aging are related to cognitive and physical decline
as separate endpoints. This work includes biomarkers of inflammation and biomarkers of hallmarks of aging
such as cell senescence, altered cell communication, epigenetic changes, telomere attrition, nutrient signaling,
and loss of proteostasis. However, rigorous epidemiologic studies have not fully investigated whether biological
mechanisms of aging affect relations and dynamics between cognitive and physical decline, or ADRD and
physical disability onset, over time. Thus, identifying early biomarkers of biological aging mechanisms that are
related to dual cognitive-physical decline and joint ADRD-disability onset in initially healthy older adults is a key
step toward geroscience-guided prevention trials. A major barrier to this goal is that studies of longitudinal
cognitive and physical endpoints are vulnerable to survival bias and unmeasured confounding. Extant
statistical methods are limited in their ability to overcome this barrier; therefore, shared biological mechanisms
of cognitive and physical endpoints are not fully known, and new statistical methods are needed. To overcome
the barriers to filling these knowledge gaps, specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) test relations of biomarkers
of aging with longitudinal dual cognitive-physical decline; 2) test relations of biomarkers of aging with time to
incident joint dementia (i.e., ADRD)-disability onset; and 3) develop/validate a biomarker of aging risk score to
predict joint dementia (i.e., ADRD)-disability. To this end, we propose to extend statistical methods for multi-
iate longitudinal and time-to-event outcomes and apply them to harmonized data from 8 cohort studies of
>11,000 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years. We hypothesize that biomarkers of aging predict
and explain, in part, relations between cognitive and physical endpoints beyond known risk factors. New
statistical methods developed as essential tools to jointly study cognitive and physical endpoints will be shared
with the scientific community. This project’s ultimate public health impact is the potential for novel biomarkers
of aging to inform geroscience strategies to prevent and predict ADRD and physical disability in older adults."
10778622,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 60% of older persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) suffer from bothersome
pain and nearly half experience pain-related activity limitations. Despite best-practice guidelines calling for
routine pain assessment of persons with ADRD, pain is severely under-detected and poorly managed in this
population. A major barrier to the identification and treatment of pain in persons with ADRD is impaired
communication. As ADRD progresses, neurodegenerative changes impede individuals’ ability to understand
and verbally articulate their discomfort. In such cases, reliable self-reports of pain are not feasible and
behavioral assessment is recommended. Informal (family) caregivers are well situated to detect pain and
facilitate management in persons with ADRD, given their extensive involvement in care activities. However,
caregivers receive virtually no guidance or training in these areas. To address the challenges that ADRD
caregivers face in recognizing and communicating about pain, the PI (Riffin) and her interdisciplinary team of
Co-Investigators developed a manualized, multicomponent intervention, the Pain Identification and
Communication Toolkit (PICT). PICT is informed by theories of behavior change and pain communication and
includes (a) training in administering an observational pain assessment tool, (b) coaching in effective pain
communication, and (c) building caregivers’ skills through routine practice. The team’s NIA-funded pilot trial
with a racially and ethnically diverse group of caregivers (14% Black, 15% Hispanic, 8% multiracial)
demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of PICT, and preliminary impact on caregivers’ communication
with healthcare providers. The proposed R01 builds on this prior research by using an Experimental Medicine
approach, grounded in the Science of Behavior Change, to evaluate PICT’s efficacy, mechanisms of action,
and potential moderators in a Stage II clinical trial. It will leverage the infrastructure of a community-based
Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) program in New York with wide socioeconomic and racial diversity to (1)
determine the efficacy of PICT on caregivers’ pain recognition and communication (Primary Outcomes),
caregivers’ distress and burden; patients’ physical function, behavioral disturbance, changes in pain
treatments or regimens, and institutionalization (Secondary Outcomes), (2) identify the patient and caregiver
factors that may moderate the effects of PICT on study outcomes, and (3) evaluate the mechanisms
(theoretically-derived variables) by which PICT affects study outcomes. Overall, this research represents a
critical step toward addressing the under-detection and under-management of pain in persons with ADRD,
supporting the largely hidden but vital ADRD caregiver workforce, and laying the groundwork for a future
multisite pragmatic trial."
10823284,"A prospective examination of sleep, eating behavior, and weight gain among overweight adults
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, which confers increased risk for reduced
quality of life, disability, chronic disease, and mortality. Efforts to reduce the public health burden of obesity
have identified bio-behavioral factors involved in the development and maintenance of high body weight.
Sleep has emerged as a particularly robust predictor of weight gain and obesity in both prospective and cross-
sectional research, but the mechanisms linking sleep and weight gain have not been adequately defined. The
purpose of the proposed study is to examine actigraphy-assessed sleep duration as a prospective predictor of
binge eating behavior and the extent to which binge eating mediates the relationship between sleep duration
and weight gain and body composition over one year among overweight and obese adults. Further, executive
function (I.e., inhibitory control, working memory, set-shifting, planning, decision making) as measured by a
neurocognitive task battery will be examined as a moderator in the relationship between sleep and binge
eating. As short sleep duration is associated with deficits in executive function, we hypothesize that higher trait
levels of executive function will attenuate the effect of short sleep duration on binge eating. Achievement of
our study aims will provide novel insight into the role of disordered eating behavior as a mechanism linking
sleep and obesity and elucidate the extent to which executive function may affect sleep’s impact on eating
behavior and weight gain. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential to inform obesity prevention
or intervention efforts and identify vulnerable individuals which allows for more strategic allocation of public
health resources."

10758785,"Project Summary/Abstract
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are among the most common and devastating of birth defects. Abnormal
development of cardiac conduction often associates with CHD etiology. Investigating the development of
cardiac conduction is essential for us to understand the mechanisms behind such conditions.
 Development of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) is a complicated transformation that comes about
through interplay between molecular signaling, structural properties, and physiological function, including
hemodynamics and electrophysiology. While an understanding of the molecular networks has progressed rapidly
in recent decades, tools to follow the physiological factors contributing to development and differentiation of the
CCS remain deficient. This gap is important to fill. Connecting molecular and functional information is key for
understanding pathologies of the conduction system and for guiding potential therapeutic strategies.
 Optical mapping (OM) of transmembrane voltage or intracellular calcium dynamics in the heart using
voltage- or calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes is a powerful tool for studying cardiac electrophysiology, and has
been adapted for imaging early embryonic hearts with great success. However currently, OM is limited to imaging
excised embryonic hearts which are stilled with excitation-contraction-uncoupler drugs. Removing fragile tubular
hearts from the structure and hemodynamic load of the embryo, and incubating them in dyes and drugs interferes
with the normal physiology and does not allow longitudinal study over stages of development.
 The goal of this project is to develop technology to enable comprehensive, longitudinal imaging of the
electrophysiological function of the living, beating heart of the early avian embryo, cultured under near-
physiological conditions. We will target 1-2 days of active morphogenesis through the transition from
homogeneous to heterogeneous conduction velocity Three key technology developments are needed to
achieve this. (A) Episcopic, volumetric, fast imaging of fluorescent voltage and calcium indicators is needed to
image the intact, living embryo, and to capture conduction dynamics (Aim 1). (B) Motion correction is needed
to enable conduction mapping of the beating heart, without using excitation-contraction-uncoupling drugs (Aim
1). (C) Embryonic quail models with calcium and voltage reporters expressed in cardiomyocytes are needed to
enable in vivo and longitudinal imaging of electrophysiology (Aim 2).
 The proposed technology will enable simultaneous 3D conduction mapping over two time scales, the
heartbeat, and heart development (5D impulse mapping). Coupled with quantitative 3D FISH, this will allow
point-to-point 3D registration between conduction data and gene/protein expression, which is not currently
available, enabling studies to better understand mechanisms of conduction function, dysfunction and
development (Aim 3)."
10764931,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition in which progressive dilatation of the infrarenal
aorta leads to rupture. With ~2.3 million prevalent cases in the United States, AAA afflicts ~4% of the population
≥ 65 years of age and is responsible for ~41,000 deaths annually. No medical therapies exist that prevent AAA,
AAA growth, rupture, or aneurysm-related death. The only efficacious intervention is surgery.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and preliminary pharmacogenetic causal inference studies from AAA
GWAS demonstrate that both LDL-C lowering and PCSK9 inhibition are protective of AAA. The greatest
therapeutic opportunities for pharmacological treatment of AAA lie in prevention of aneurysm expansion in
individuals with small AAA. Despite our team's robust evidence linking LDL-C and PCSK9 to the development
of AAA, their causal role in AAA growth remains unknown and the data to support conducting a large-scale
efficacy trial is lacking.
This project will leverage two orthogonal approaches to generate data that supports the role of LDL-C in AAA
growth and that intensive LDL-C lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors will protect against aneurysm expansion. First,
we will perform a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of GWAS of AAA growth rate and leverage these data to conduct
genetic causal inference experiments interrogating the role of PCSK9 and LDL-c in AAA expansion. Second, we
will conduct a quadruple-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled mechanistic clinical trial to test the effect of
intensive short-term LDL-C lowering with PCSK9 inhibition on inflammation in the aneurysmal aortic wall; the
primary outcome will be the production of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) monocytes/macrophages
in the aortic wall as measured by single nucleus RNA sequencing and confirmed by bulk RNA sequencing tissue-
based immunofluorescence. Key secondary outcomes include: 1) matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)
production and activity; 2) relative numbers, cell type distribution, and inflammatory state of infiltrating immune
cells; and 3) the relative number and proliferative/contractile state of aortic smooth muscle cells in the aortic wall.
Successfully completing the proposed research will establish causal evidence linking LDL-C and AAA growth,
and the ability to modulate this with PCSK9 inhibition. It will provide human mechanistic evidence that PCSK9
inhibitors induce anti-inflammatory changes in aneurysmal aortic wall that protect from aneurysm expansion.
These data will provide the justification for a future large-scale randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy
of PCSK9 inhibitors to treat AAA."

Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious long-term disability and particularly devastating to rural
communities. In the United States, rural areas have an estimated 30% greater stroke mortality compared to
urban areas. Limited access to time-sensitive acute stroke therapies is an important cause of rural disparities
in stroke morbidity and mortality. Regional stroke systems of care that coordinate emergency medical services
(EMS), emergency departments, inter-facility transfer agencies, and hospitals can improve access to acute
stroke care for underserved populations. However, evidence on effective and efficient stroke system designs
and strategies is lacking. Prehospital stroke screening by EMS and routing directly to a stroke center
specialized in providing advanced care can significantly reduce time to treatment and improve patient
outcomes. However, optimal EMS stroke triage and transport strategies that maximize benefit to stroke
patients and efficiently use emergency medical resources are largely unknown and depend on regional and
local characteristics. Therefore, our overall objective is to develop a decision-analytic systems model that
allows stroke system planners to compare potential effects of regionalized EMS triage and transport strategies
on rural stroke outcomes and health care resource utilization. Decision-analytic modeling is a rigorous and
flexible approach for integrating information sources to conduct in silico testing of system-level strategies under
varying contexts. This comparative evidence provides valuable and timely information to decision makers to
tailor interventions for real-world implementation and evaluation. Using existing real-world data sources,
published evidence, and key stakeholder input, we will build a computer simulation model of regionalized
stroke care for 70 rural counties in North Carolina. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine EMS stroke triage
and transport strategies that optimize functional outcomes in rural stroke patients; (2) estimate the potential
system-wide effects of rural EMS triage and transport on health care resource utilization; and (3) understand
the influence of rural population and health care system characteristics on optimizing EMS stroke triage and
transport strategies. In response to NOT-MD-20-025, this project aims to understand and address stroke
disparities by improving access to timely acute care for underserved rural populations. Upon successful
completion, we will have contributed a novel decision support framework to understand and improve regional
stroke systems of care across various settings. Our future research will implement refined EMS stroke triage
and transport strategies into rural systems and prospectively evaluate long-term patient outcomes and
healthcare costs. This line of research has high potential to address significant morbidity and mortality and
health disparities caused by acute stroke and other time- and resource-dependent medical emergencies (e.g.,
myocardial infarction, sepsis, and trauma)."

Stroke is a disabling cerebrovascular disease that causes 5.5 million deaths each
year globally. The disease progresses rapidly and irreversibly, leaving a narrow
time window for intervention. Existing methods for patient selection for endo-
vascular thrombectomy are suboptimal, based exclusively on simple linear
threshold models applied to neuroimaging. Deep learning has shown great
promise in recent years for many medical applications. We believe that it can
be used to integrate imaging and non-imaging data in a seamless and data-
driven way to improve stroke triage and clinical trials.
The goal of this project is to develop deep convolutional neural network
approaches to the initial MR and CT imaging, the most commonly performed
stroke imaging protocol in acute ischemic stroke patients, and to combine this
with non-imaging clinical information. We will train networks to predict the
most likely final tissue and clinical outcomes under 2 extreme conditions
(major reperfusion and minimal reperfusion) to estimate the treatment effect at
the individual level. Next, we use the methods and learning from this first study
to train deep learning models without using contrast perfusion imaging, which
will improve safety, cost, and time-to-treatment. Finally, we will test the
generalizability and explainability of these AI methods in external cohorts
which differ in terms of population and scanner types, including testing on data
from mobile CT scanners.
Accomplishment of these aims will fundamentally shift the acute stroke
paradigm beyond the relatively simplistic mismatch concept and replace it with
a data-driven method that takes into account the immense amount of imaging
and clinical data that can be brought to the stroke decision-making process.
The methods developed will improve long-term outcomes and reduce of the
cost of stroke care worldwide."

 Current “disease-modifying drugs” for MS have changed the course of disease with decrease in
relapse and possible slowing of the progression. however, many patients eventually experience
relapses and/or disease progression. There is thus a clearly unmet need for developing safer and
more effective MS therapies. IL-37, a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines, has been recently
recognized as a novel immunoregulatory cytokine. Importantly, IL-37 exerts its function through a
“dual-effect” property, i.e., both as a secreted cytokine that will act through its receptor IL-37R (SIGIRR
and IL-18Ra) and as a transcription factor, and this distinct property may make IL-37 a more powerful
immunomodulator than most conventional cytokines for clinical application. Based on the literature and
our preliminary observations, we hypothesize that IL-37 is a key regulator of inflammation in CNS
autoimmunity through induction of amphiregulin, a tissue-repair associated cytokine with
immunomodulatory properties. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To
define IL-37R expression and IL-37 responsiveness in immune cells of MS patients. We will first
identify the source(s) of IL-37 and compare IL-37R expression and responsiveness to IL-37 in immune
cells of MS patients vs. healthy controls. We will also test our hypothesis that IL-37 treatment will block
proinflammatory monocyte- or Th1/Th17 cell-induced demyelination, using a novel organotypic slice
culture system of adult human brain tissue. (2) To determine the effect of IL-37 on CNS resident cells
during autoimmune neuroinflammation. We will first test the effect of IL-37 on microglia, astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes of murine and human origin. We will then determine the expression of IL-37R in CNS
resident cells from patients with MS. Finally, we will test if upregulation of the IL-37R (TIR8 subunit)
suppresses neuroinflammation. 3) To investigate the induction of the amphiregulin pathway as a
possible mechanism of IL-37 action. This will be tested in amphiregulin conditional knockout EAE mice
and monocytes and T/B cells of healthy subjects and. MS patients.
 Information gained from these studies could result in a better understanding of pathogenic
mechanisms of MS and in the development of new strategies for regulating the immune response in
order to stop the progression of this disease, and likely other autoimmune diseases."

Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord is the most common intervention in humans, occurring in 140 million
annual births. To maximize expediency (manage 3rd stage of labor, initiate neonatal resuscitation), early cord
clamping (ECC) is performed within ~30 sec of delivery. Recently, evidence has emerged on the health benefits
of delayed cord clamping (DCC, waiting ~1-2 min before clamping). Among term neonates, multiple randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that DCC transfers blood from placentas to newborns, resulting in less iron-
deficiency anemia and improved neurodevelopmental (neuromotor) outcomes through 4 years, than with ECC.
Despite advantages for healthy newborns, in view of their exclusion from previous RCTs, the best approach to
cord clamping in higher-risk pregnancies, notably those complicated by a fetal diagnosis of critical congenital
heart disease (CCHD), remains uncertain. Although one might assume that the benefits of DCC in low-risk new-
born populations would translate simply to CCHD neonates, unique anatomic and physiologic differences in
neonates with CCHD suggest that risks of DCC in this subgroup may differ from risks in neonates without CCHD.
Thus, a treatment dilemma exists on the optimal cord clamping practice at birth among CCHD neonates. The
proposed study, entitled CORD-CHD (Clamp OR Delay in neonates with Congenital Heart Disease) trial will be
the first RCT to determine the effectiveness of DCC vs. ECC on postnatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes
of CCHD neonates. Our preliminary data demonstrate that, among CCHD neonates, DCC results in lower global
rank scores (GRS), indicative of better health outcomes, than ECC. GRS is a validated composite measure,
based upon the worst outcome post-cardiac surgery or catheterization and reflects the need for complex inten-
sive care. Given the absence of high-quality data, maternal outcomes will also be determined. We will leverage
a network of sites with requisite infrastructures, established guidelines with high adherence rates and treatment
fidelity, and track records of collaboration. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that, among CCHD neonates, DCC
results in lower GRS (better outcomes) post-cardiac surgery or catheterization, based on a higher win-odds (win-
ratio adapted to include ties), than with ECC. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that, among neonates with CCHD,
DCC will result in better neuromotor outcomes at 22-26mos postnatal, based on a joint test of a bivariate outcome
(Developmental Assessment of Young Children Second Edition motor score and the Hammersmith Neonate
Neurological Exam) than with ECC. As a secondary objective, we will test the hypothesis that among CCHD
neonates improved neuromotor profiles (General Movement Assessment) at 3-4mos mediate improved neuro-
motor outcomes at 22-26mos. Aim 3 is to precisely estimate the difference in the risk of maternal postpartum
hemorrhage between DCC and ECC to evaluate safety among mothers who give birth to CCHD neonates. This
trial will advance the care of CCHD neonates and provide the evidence called for by national and international
organizations, creating a global impact on umbilical cord management among a vulnerable population."
10771281,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Primary cilia are present on most renal epithelial cells and their disruption leads to cyst formation. Despite their
clinical importance, the function of the primary renal cilium remains poorly understood. In previous studies, we
and others demonstrated that when cilia assembly (Ift88 mutant) or function (Pkd1 or Pkd2) is disrupted in adult
mice, cysts form slowly in focal areas. This occurs despite nearly all epithelial cells in the kidney being mutant
for these genes. A hint as to why these cysts develop in focal locations in the adult-induced mutants has emerged
from data indicating that renal injury promotes cyst formation and results in cyst formation throughout the kidney.
Based on these data, we propose that PKD2 and cilia regulate renal injury and repair responses and that the
focal cysts in the adult-induced mutants result from a few cells that have experienced an injury. In the absence
of normal cilia function, these cells enter a state of persistent maladaptive repair (as marked by persistent SOX9
expression) and progress to cystogenesis. While cysts are formed in Ift88 and Pkd2 mutants, the cystic kidney
phenotype is always more severe with loss of Pkd2. In double mutants, however, the cystic pathology resembles
the milder Ift88 mutant alone. Our analysis further shows that the inflammatory response following injury in the
Ift88 and Pkd2 mutant mice is altered and as observed with cyst formation; it is exacerbated in Pkd2 mutants
compared to Ift88 or Ift88/Pkd2 double mutants. Collectively, these data suggest that IFT88/cilia and PKD2
regulate signaling activities between the ciliated tubule epithelium and the responding non-ciliated immune cells
for initiation and resolution of an injury response and that cyst formation is promoted when these signaling
pathways are incorrectly controlled. The goals of this proposal are to define the cellular and then molecular
mechanism(s) responsible for the focal and widespread injury-induced cyst formation and how IFT88/cilia and
PKD2 are involved in this process. From this proposal, we will determine whether cilia loss/dysfunction alters the
kidney's sensitivity to injury and results in an increase in the state of epithelial cell maladaptive repair. We will
utilize lineage tracing approaches to determine if descendants of injured cells contribute directly to cyst formation.
We will define new IFT88/cilia and PKD2-dependent intercellular signaling networks involved in the injury and
repair process and how they are dysregulated when cilia are disrupted (Ift88 mutant) or cilia function is perturbed
(Pkd2 mutant). Finally, we will define mechanisms by which loss of Ift88 in a Pkd2 mutant background
suppresses cyst severity through changes in these injury and repair signaling pathways. The data from the
proposal are needed to: 1) elucidate novel functions of the renal cilium, 2) define cellular mechanisms involved
in formation of the sporadic and widespread cysts, 3) understand how IFT88/cilia and PKD2 are involved in
regulating injury/repair responses, 4) assess how disrupting this injury response promotes cyst formation and
expansion, and 5) explore mechanisms involved in the epistatic relationship between Ift88 and Pkd2 mutations."

In zebrafish, the genetic toolkit is limited to global and tissue-specific gene inactivation. However, often it is
desirable to inactivate genes in specific tissues and at specific times. Moreover, phenotypes do not become
evident until pre-existing protein product from the targeted gene has decayed. This lag can be many hours or
even days. This is a problem when studying rapid biological processes or genes that are required for cell
survival. In recent years, several strategies have been developed to overcome these limitations. Most of the
strategies target the protein gene product directly, typically by tagging the protein with a degron that can be
induced to degrade the tagged protein. We recently adapted the deGradFP system from flies to zebrafish and
called it zGrad. zGrad targets GFP-tagged proteins for degradation and reveals loss-of-function phenotypes.
zGrad consists of a fusion of an anti-GFP nanobody to a F-box domain. zGrad binds GFP-tagged proteins
through its anti-GFP nanobody part and targets the tagged protein to the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for
degradation through its F-box domain. In its current form, zGrad can be used to degrade proteins with either
spatial or temporal control, but not both. Here we propose to engineer significant improvements to the zGrad
system. Specifically, we will (1) expand zGrad so that it can be used to degrade proteins with combined spatial
and temporal control, and (2) engineer zGrad so that it is regulated through light to induce degradation in
specific cells and subcellular compartments at desired times. These improvements will make zGrad an
extremely powerful and versatile system for inactivating genes rapidly in specific cells at specific times in
zebrafish, and would provide proof-of-principle that the deGradFP/zGrad method could be adapted to function
in any system."

Adipose tissue is a central player in energy balance and glucose homeostasis, it is able to expand in the face of
caloric overload in order to store energy safely, but it can become overloaded and dysfunctional, leading to
systemic metabolic compromise in the form of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. To investigate differences
in individual cell types in lean and obese individuals, I have performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (sNuc-
seq) on human subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue and created an atlas of cell types present in
white adipose tissue. A major finding from this work was the identification of distinct subpopulations of
adipocytes, some of which are associated with body mass index (BMI). By associating our data with genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) for metabolic traits such as T2D, we additionally predict that some adipocyte
subpopulations are associated with metabolic disease. The objective of this project is to identify factors that
predispose one subpopulation over another, both externally as well as transcriptionally. To do this I will perform
sNuc-seq on adipose tissue collected from subjects during and post-bariatric surgery in order to characterize the
change in adipocyte subpopulation during weight loss. I will next interrogate the chromatin state of adipocyte
subpoulations by performing the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin on single nuclei from adipose
tissue of lean and obese individuals. Finally, I will directly test potential signaling and transcriptional regulators
of subpopulation identity by performing a screen of potential signaling regulators as well as a CRISPRa screen
of potential transcriptional regulators to try to recapitulate distinct subpopulations in vitro. The experience that I
have in characterizing adipose tissue at single cell resolution, as well as the experience of my mentor and co-
mentor in studying transcriptional and genetic regulation of adipocytes make me uniquely positioned to answer
these questions. Taken together, these studies will enhance our knowledge of human white adipocyte diversity
and will set the stage for downstream studies in my own independent lab and in the community at large."

The olfactory epithelium is situated in the nasal passages at the interface with the environment
– a location that makes it vulnerable to damage by both infectious and non-microbial threats.
While the innate immune defenses of the respiratory epithelium are increasingly well
understood, the immune mechanisms protecting the delicate olfactory neuroepithelium have not
been fully elucidated. Inflammation of the olfactory epithelium can result in the loss of the sense
of smell, which is a debilitating health problem in the United States significantly impacting the
quality of life of affected individuals. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how viral
infection and the local immune response of the olfactory epithelium can impair sense of smell
function, although the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesize that the lining cells of the
olfactory epithelium, called sustentacular cells, play a critical role protecting the underlying
neurons by maintaining a strong physical barrier and providing a supporting framework. Once
damaged, olfactory tissue has a remarkable and unique neuroregenerative capacity, allowing
rapid repair by creation of new neurons. The signals that drive and regulate regeneration by
olfactory progenitor cells are unclear. Our preliminary studies in mice reveal that regulated
inflammation is important to initiating normal repair after olfactory injury. We also have found
that olfactory stem cells deep in the mucosa are capable of communicating with immune cells to
mediate inflammation. In this way, we propose that olfactory stem cells provide innate immune
protection to the epithelium. We hypothesize that injury to the surface barrier exposes olfactory
stem cells to stimuli that drive inflammation and replacement of apical cells. The overall goal of
this proposal is to explore neuroepithelial-immune interactions in the olfactory epithelium. In
aim 1, we will investigate the innate immune activity of olfactory stem cells and demonstrate
whether inflammatory cells and their chemical signals modulate basal cell function. In aim 2, we
will explore the role of stem cells in modulating the immune response and in fighting infection.
Finally, in aim 3, we will study the immune response of sustentacular cells and olfactory stem
cells to inflammatory signals related to two common causes of loss of the sense of smell: nasal
polyps and infection with SARS-CoV-2. These studies will significantly advance current
knowledge about the olfactory system and create an opportunity to develop innovative therapies
for important health conditions impacting the sense of smell."

Cellular senescence, characterized by stable proliferation arrest and secretion of pro-inflammatory factors,
is not only a hallmark of aging, but also a key contributor to age-associated diseases in humans. As the US
population is aging, there is an added urgency to gain a better understanding of cellular senescence in
different tissues over the lifespan. Unfortunately, we still lack the knowledge to unambiguously define
senescence at the molecular and cellular levels, due to its heterogeneous phenotypes. To address this major
gap in knowledge, we propose to establish a tissue mapping center that focuses on the identification and
characterization of senescent cells in healthy mouse brain, bone marrow, breast, colon and liver. Our
research strategy builds on recent advances in single cell epigenomics technologies that our team developed
and the knowledge that senescent cells exhibit characteristic changes in the chromatin landscapes and
histone modifications along with gene expression levels at marker genes of cellular senescence. We will
deploy cutting-edge single cell in situ and tissue dissociative multi-omic tools that have been well established
in our center to produce comprehensive single cell resolution maps of the transcriptome and epigenome in
male and female mouse brain, bone marrow, breast, colon and liver, and to provide qualitative and
quantitative spatial maps of the normal burden of senescent cells in these vital organs, across the lifespan of
two mouse strains. We will rigorously validate the newly defined senescent cell populations using
pharmacologic and genetic approaches to eradicate senescent cells or suppress their inflammatory
phenotype, and orthogonal state-of-the-art and conventional assays for cellular senescence. We will
generate whole genome single cell DNA methylation data to link our spatial atlas to measurement of
epigenetic age, a candidate predictor of beneficial versus detrimental effects of senescent cells. We expect
that comprehensive single cell atlases of epigenome and transcriptome will enable us to identify and
characterize cellular senescence in different tissue contexts and during aging.
We expect that the planned
research will provide a reference for future studies that seek to characterize and target senescent cells
associated with or preceding disease in
brain, bone marrow, breast, colon and liver."

 This proposal addresses the translation and degradation of mRNAs subject to premature
translation termination. Such mRNAs are usually thought to be derived from genes harboring nonsense
mutations, but also include cytoplasmic products of failed or alternative splicing, transcripts of
pseudogenes or unproductive gene rearrangements, and mRNAs with upstream open reading frames, as
well as mRNAs arising from non-standard transcription initiation or undergoing out-of-frame translation
initiation or unexpected frameshifting. Translational elongation on these transcripts generally leads to
ribosomal recognition of a premature termination codon (PTC) and to the triggering of accelerated mRNA
decay in a process known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The central regulators of this
mRNA quality control pathway are the three Upf proteins (Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3). Although NMD has been
studied extensively in multiple eukaryotes, the precise mechanisms by which the Upf proteins recognize a
ribosome undergoing an atypical termination event and respond to it by triggering accelerated degradation
of the associated mRNA remain unknown. In several recent studies we have begun to gain significant
mechanistic insight into NMD in the yeast model system and to discern what appear to be at least four
definable steps during which: 1) Upf1 binds stochastically to elongating ribosomes while monitoring
translational termination, 2) Upf1 association with a ribosome engaged in premature termination is
stabilized and a commitment to NMD is promoted by Upf2 and Upf3 binding, 3) activation of the Upf1
helicase activity by ATP hydrolysis promotes dissociation of the termination complex and recruitment of
the mRNA decapping enzyme, and 4) post-decapping, the body of the mRNA is digested exonucleolytically
by Xrn1. In the experiments of this proposal we will use the tools of yeast genetics, molecular biology, and
cryo-electron microscopy to pursue several critical aspects of this model by addressing three goals that
seek to: elucidate the mechanism of decapping activation of NMD substrates by Upf1, determine the roles
and functional order for factors that link premature termination to mRNA decapping, and define the basis
for Pab1 enhancement of translation termination efficiency, likely a key step for distinguishing premature
from normal termination. At the conclusion of this study we anticipate being able to formulate a more
integrated model detailing the atypical aspects of premature translation termination, the mechanism by
which premature termination is targeted by the three Upf proteins, and the molecular events linking the
functions of Upf proteins to targeted mRNA decay. We expect that our refined model for yeast NMD will
be generally applicable to the molecular events of NMD in higher organisms and will provide insights to
improving therapeutic approaches to human diseases caused by nonsense mutations."
10778591,"Molecular mechanisms of intersecting human telomeric functions
Project Summary/Abstract
Telomeres perform three essential functions in human cells. First, telomeres protect chromosomes against
catastrophic end-to-end fusions by shielding them from the DNA damage sensing pathways. A six-membered
protein complex called shelterin binds specifically to telomeric DNA to afford end protection. Second, telomeres
facilitate end replication, allowing proliferating cells like stem/progenitor cells and cancer cells to replenish
chromosome ends. A complex ribonucleoprotein enzyme called telomerase helps solve end replication.
Telomerase facilitates end replication by adding telomeric DNA to chromosome ends using its RNA template.
While telomerase activation in somatic cells is a hallmark of cancer, telomerase dysfunction in stem cells
results in diseases called telomeropathies. Shelterin must protect chromosome ends from illicit DNA fusions
but allow telomerase to access the same ends. A shelterin protein called TPP1 is instrumental in recruiting
telomerase to telomeres, allowing shelterin to facilitate end protection and end replication, but the molecular
mechanism of how TPP1 switches from end-protection mode to end-replication mode during S-phase is not
known. Third, telomeres help homologous chromosomes undergo pairing and meiotic crossover to facilitate
gamete production. To perform this function, telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope with the help of a
meiosis-specific protein complex called TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN and connect with the cytoskeletal force-
generating machinery. This allows chromosomes to move, enabling homologous chromosomes to pair up and
undergo meiotic crossover. Paired meiotic chromosomes must be protected from telomeric recombination at
the nuclear envelope, but how this occurs is not known at the molecular level. Illuminating the molecular
interplay between the three telomeric functions will enrich our understanding of how genome integrity is upheld
and suggest novel therapeutic avenues for diseases like cancers, telomeropathies, and infertility. This proposal
aims to apply the knowledge of telomeres, telomerase, and meiotic assemblies, and expertise in biochemistry,
crystallography, and cell biology to understand how human telomeres perform their three critical functions,
especially in the contexts where these clash with one another. It also aims to discover new factors responsible
for upholding these functions and reveal their underlying biochemical activities. Finally, this proposal aims to
dissect the molecular mechanism of disease caused by the disruption of these functions and test new
strategies for therapeutic development. The proposed approach to dissect the molecular mechanisms of
intersecting telomeric processes will enhance our knowledge of how telomeres enable genome integrity and
suggest therapeutic opportunities to tackle telomere dysfunction in disease."

The Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways are intimately associated with tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis.
However, how these two pathways crosstalk remains elusive and has been a matter of intense debate. Both
positive and negative regulation of Wnt signaling by YAP/TAZ, the intracellular mediators of Hippo signaling, has
been reported, and further studies are clearly required to resolve the controversy regarding the functional and
signaling interactions between these two important pathways. In the intestinal epithelium where Wnt signaling
plays a pivotal role in controlling stem cell renewal and differentiation, our recent work demonstrated that Lats1/2,
the core Hippo kinases, are required for sustaining Wnt signaling in intestinal stem cells. We showed that Lats1/2
removal inhibits Wnt pathway downstream of APC/β-Catenin in the intestine in a cell-autonomous manner. In
this grant, we will use a combination of genetic, proteomic and chemical approaches to dissect the molecular
basis of the YAP/TAZ-Wnt crosstalk in the intestine. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the ability of YAP/TAZ to
inhibit Wnt/TCF activation in both wild type and APC mutated intestine, using two new conditional alleles of
nuclear YAP/TAZ we recently generated. We will also determine the molecular mechanism by which nuclear
YAP/TAZ suppress Wnt/TCF transcriptional activation downstream of APC. In Specific Aim 2, we define the Wnt-
uncoupled TEAD-dependent downstream programs in APC- and Lats1/2- mutated intestinal epithelium and
explore therapeutic targeting TEAD in intestinal tumors using animal models."
10768568,"Abstract
 The EGF receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently mutated or over-
expressed in a variety of tumors. Stimulation of the receptor by EGF leads to the activation of its intracellular
tyrosine kinase which autophosphorylates multiple tyrosines on its intrinsically-disordered C-terminal tail.
These phosphotyrosines serve as binding sites for the SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins that mediate
the downstream effects of EGF. SH2 and PTB domains recognize their binding sites via a short linear motif
in which the pTyr is embedded. In preliminary experiments, we have found that regions well outside of these
short motifs contribute to the binding of SH2 and PTB domain proteins. Further evidence for the importance
of more distant sequences in the binding of SH2 domains to the EGFR tail was derived from our preliminary
computer modeling studies that show that when the Grb2 SH2 domain is bound to Tyr-1068, the sequence
surrounding Tyr-1148, the major site of autophosphorylation of the EGFR, interacts with a secondary binding
surface on the SH2 domain. This interaction limits the availability of Tyr-1148 to bind to its partner proteins.
We therefore hypothesize that regions of the tail distant from the pTyr motif participate in the binding of SH2
domain proteins and that these extended interactions modify the conformational ensemble of the tail and alter
its ability to interact with other partners in a form of ensemble allostery.
 The EGFR can be activated by any one of seven different ligands, which can elicit different long-term
biological effects when applied to the same cell. Stimulation of the same cell with two different ligands can
give rise to two completely different biological outcomes. We have demonstrated differences in the ability of
different ligands to induce receptor homo- and hetero-dimerization and to bind downstream signaling proteins.
In preliminary studies, we have also documented differences in their ability to stimulate glycolytic flux, a key
metabolic feature of rapidly growing cells. Different tumors are known to be preferentially transformed by
structurally different forms of the EGFR and to express different EGFR ligands. In many instances, clinical
outcome has been shown to correlate with which ligand is expressed. We hypothesize that the structurally
diverse oncogenic EGFRs are functionally different and that certain combinations of EGFR variant and ligand
are more transforming than others. The goal of my laboratory is to elucidate the fundamental principles
underlying signaling via receptor tyrosine kinases and to apply this to understand how mutant EGFRs induce
tumors. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Determine how inter-tyrosine sequences modulate the
binding of SH2 domain proteins to the C-terminal tail of the EGFR; and, 2) Identify functional differences
among oncogenic EGFRs and their response to EGFR agonists that are relevant to how transformation is
established and maintained."

More than 1.8 million people worldwide are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) every year.
Of these patients, 20% present with stage I or II disease. For these patients, surgical resection remains the
first course of treatment, however even in apparently curative surgery 50% of stage I and 70% of stage II
NSCLC patients will recur and eventually die of the disease. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are
standard treatments for resectable NSCLC and are used with the dual goals of reducing tumor size prior to
surgery and preventing relapse. We recently completed a clinical trial of neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade in
resectable NSCLC and demonstrated an impressive 45% major pathologic response rate. To date, however,
the mechanisms underlying response to this treatment are unknown. In the study proposed here, we will
leverage this existing clinical trial and the biospecimens already obtained to elucidate the functional impact of
PD-1 blockade on tumor-reactive T cells and to determine how differential T cell transcriptional programs
facilitate pathologic response. We will implement a novel approach, using the T cell receptor as a molecular
barcode for antigen-specificity using basic and single cell sequencing technologies, to understand the
dynamic interplay of different T cell subsets and how their transcriptional programming is modified by anti-
PD-1. Identification of targetable markers of response or resistance, development of novel bioinformatic
approaches to analyze neoantigen-specific single cell data, and enumeration of immunogenomic
determinants of pathologic response to neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade are only some of the key outcomes of
this study."
10802403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic diseases are increasing worldwide in prevalence and severity. Globally, approximately 650 million
people are obese or overweight, over half of whom are children. The healthcare burden of obesity is enormous
and only growing. Circadian rhythms play a central role in healthy metabolism and in maintaining proper host-
microbe interactions. Circadian rhythms in feeding and behavior create a feedback loop, driving rhythms in
hepatic transcription, which in turn drive rhythms in host and microbial metabolism that ultimately feedback onto
circadian rhythms in host behavior. This network of rhythms is severely disrupted in obese mice consuming a
Western diet. Early-life diet interacts with the developing microbiome to program metabolism and disease risk,
but how the early-life microbiota contribute to development of the host metabolic circadian network remains
unknown. There is an urgent need to identify mechanisms by which gut microbes interact with diet early in life to
shape these circadian networks that coordinate daily rhythms in metabolism.
 Mice devoid of all microbes (‘germ-free’) exhibit disrupted circadian rhythms in numerous aspects of host
metabolism compared to mice that have had microbes since birth. Remarkably, repopulating germ-free mice
later in adulthood with microbes (‘conventionalization') only partially normalizes their circadian rhythms. This
indicates that the age at which gut microbes are acquired must play a critical role in the development of
circadian networks that govern metabolism. But when and how healthy and obesogenic microbes first begin
to normalize and disrupt, respectively, the circadian network remain unexamined.
Our research will bridge this gap in knowledge by testing the hypothesis that the organismal circadian
network is shaped by interactions between the type of gut microbes acquired and the developmental
age of acquisition. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that the age when mice acquire a normal, healthy microbiome
determines the robustness of their circadian network in adulthood. We will conventionalize germ-free mice with
microbes during gestation, at weaning, or in adulthood. Phenotypes across the entire circadian network will be
examined later in life, including: hepatic clock and clock-controlled gene expression via RNA-seq, microbial
community oscillations via 16S rRNA, and host behavioral circadian rhythms thermoregulation and via wireless
telemetry inside sterile isolators. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that obesogenic diets early in life disrupt normal
development of the circadian network through a combination of microbe-dependent and microbe-independent
mechanisms. Beginning early in life, germ-free mice will be administered an obesogenic diet alone, obesogenic
microbes alone, or both obesogenic diet and microbes. Metabolic circadian networks will be examined as in Aim
1. These studies will specify how diet and microbes interact to affect the developing host-microbial circadian
network. New insights into how metabolic programming impacts the circadian system will inform early-life dietary
and microbial interventions that may afford prophylaxis against the development of obesity."

This proposal builds upon our discovery in the previous funding period of a novel pathway in
prostate cancer cells that integrates androgen signaling with ADP-ribosylation. The pathway has
four key components, the androgen receptor (AR), Parp7, Parp9 and Dtx3L. We found that the
pathway involves AR induction of Parp7 and multi-site mono-ADP-ribosylation by Parp7, on
cysteines in the AR amino-terminal domain. In this pathway, Parp7 acts as an ADP-ribose writer
and Parp9 serves as an ADP-ribose reader, and the outcome of these reactions is androgen-
dependent assembly of an AR-Dtx3L/Parp9 complex and regulation of AR activity as a
transcription factor. With this knowledge base, we are positioned to tackle important questions
on how the pathway drives biological effects in prostate cancer cells, and whether Parp7 is an
actionable target in models that include castrate-resistant prostate cancer where there is an
unmet clinical need. In Aim 1, we will determine how the AR-Parp7 pathway and mono-ADP-
ribosylation regulate tumorigenesis in prostate cancer cells using structure-function experiments
that interrogate the contributions of each of the four components. Since AR is the only known
Parp7 substrate in prostate cancer cells, we will define the ADP-ribosyl-proteome in prostate
cancer cells to identify additional, AR-independent pathways, by which Parp7 regulates prostate
cancer cells. In Aim 2 we will determine the molecular basis for ADP-ribose writing and reading
on the AR-Parp7 pathway. Parp7 ADP-ribosylation of AR is specific for androgen-bound AR,
and we have a strategy in place to determine how the agonist conformation of AR generates
sites that are permissive for ADP-ribosylation. AR will be used as a model to study the reader
function of Parp9 macrodomains, in particular, the features that are important for selectivity. In
Aim 3 we determine the vulnerability of prostate cancer cells to a first-in-class Parp7 inhibitor,
and test whether the inhibitor can prostate growth and metastasis. Our study will benefit from
significant contributions from a team of national and international scientists with expertise in
prostate cancer models, proteome-scale mass spectrometry, synthetic peptide chemistry, Parp
structural biology, and implementation of Parp inhibitors. Our overall hypothesis is that
androgen signaling transduced through Parp7 regulates both genomic and non-genomic
pathways, and that selective blockade of Parp7 will inhibit prostate tumorigenesis. If the
hypothesis is correct, our work will identify Parp7 as a new therapeutic target in prostate cancer
and expand the toolbox of Parp inhibitor-based treatments."

The epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased prevalence of associated cardiometabolic diseases
including elevated serum triglycerides (TGs) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is resurgent
interest in drugs targeting the hepatic nuclear receptor PPARα. Such fibrate drugs are already used in
hypertriglyceridemia, and there is new appreciation that TGs independently cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease such that lowering TGs reduces risk. Furthermore, PPAR agonists may be among the first drugs
approved for NAFLD. Adverse clinical outcomes in NAFLD like cirrhotic liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma,
and liver-related death are all closely linked to hepatic fibrosis. Our preliminary data in a NAFLD mouse model
show unexpectedly that PPARα deficiency and PPARα agonist treatment both fail to change hepatic steatosis,
but markedly affect fibrosis (increasing and decreasing it, respectively). PPARα functions in hepatocytes to bind
regulatory DNA and affect expression of key genes in lipid metabolism. The related nuclear receptor HNF4α is
not a drug target, yet regulates similar genes and binds similar regulatory DNA. We hypothesize that the interplay
of PPARα and HNF4α in DNA binding affects hepatocyte gene regulation, relevant to the pathogenesis and
therapeutics of NAFLD. Our experiments probe genome-wide nuclear receptor binding sites and gene regulation,
in normal and steatotic livers, basally and in response to drugs. Aim 1 defines the interdependency of PPARα
and HNF4α in liver gene regulation, using mouse models deficient in either or both. Aim 2 extends these studies
of PPARα and HNF4α to NAFLD, in both mouse models and human biospecimens. Aim 3 deploys the powerful
tools of genetics to characterize PPARα and HNF4α interplay in sequence-specific DNA binding. By comparing
inbred mouse strains, natural polymorphisms affecting binding motifs will reveal mechanisms for selective and
common DNA binding by PPARα and HNF4α. In human liver samples, we will test the hypothesis that that non-
coding genetic variants in PPARα/HNF4α genomic binding sites underlie some differences among people in TG
levels, NAFLD, and response of these to PPARα agonist drugs. Beyond this potential clinical relevance, these
studies use innovative genomic and genetic approaches to address key unanswered questions in the biology of
PPARα, including its interplay with related nuclear receptors."

Human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), comprised of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, constitute a
major health problem in developed countries. While precise etiology is not clearly defined, genetic
predisposition, altered gut microbiota, and Western diet are risk factors for IBD. However, how these factors
are coordinated in inducing and triggering IBD is poorly understood. We recently demonstrated that mice
deficient in the inflammasome are susceptible to experimental colitis, which is associated with altered gut
microbiota. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex involved in the cleavage of caspase-1, which in turn
activates proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18. Our preliminary study demonstrated that the
administration of IL-18 in inflammasome-deficient mice during colitis reduces colitis susceptibility which is
associated with a reduction of pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that the inflammasome/IL-18 signaling axis
plays a critical role in maintaining healthy microbial community and intestinal homeostasis. Notably, IL-18-
deficient and other inflammasome defective mice are prone to develop obesity and exhibit defective glucose
metabolism. Consistently, we observed an elevated level of glucose and reduced expression of a glucose
transporter gene in inflammasome-deficient mouse guts. Notably, glucose is the primary energy source for
many pathogenic bacteria. We, therefore, hypothesize that the inflammasome maintains intestinal glucose
homeostasis via regulation of selective glucose transporters in intestinal epithelial cells, and inflammasome
dysfunction leads to glucose accumulation in the gut triggering colitis via modulation of gut microbiota. These
hypotheses will be tested through addressing two specific aims: Aim 1: to determine the role of dietary glucose
in colitis pathogenesis, and Aim 2: to elucidate the role of the inflammasome in glucose homeostasis in the gut.
Overall, this study will establish a role for dietary simple sugar glucose in colitis pathogenesis, and reveal a
novel immune mechanism for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the gut. The data obtained from this study
will guide diet recommendations for IBD patients and lead to developing novel IBD treatments targeting the
inflammasome or its downstream signaling pathways involved in glucose transport."

Adaptive behavior critically depends on the ability to make predictions from mental models, or cognitive maps.
These allow us to act preemptively when events are expected, for instance by shifting our attention, thoughts,
and behavior. However, when expectations are incorrect, such biases may be inappropriate and should be
suppressed. An inability to override the effects of expectations is a common feature of psychiatric disorders such
as depression and anxiety, for instance when fixed negative predictions excessively bias thoughts and behavior.
To help us understand the neural basis for these symptoms, this project examines how expectations influence
motivated behavior and are suppressed when they are not appropriate. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical
for using mental models to create expectations. Although neurons in OFC are well-known to signal the value of
expected outcomes, how these expectations are balanced with new information to adaptively guide behavior is
not well understood. One hurdle is that OFC is large and functionally heterogeneous, particularly in primates,
making it difficult to glean a comprehensive understanding of how the region contributes to expectations and
resulting behavior. Here, we propose a novel approach that will provide an unprecedented view of OFC activity
and functional organization. We will use micro-electrocorticography (µECoG) arrays custom-designed to cover
nearly the entire orbital surface in the macaque brain. This mesoscale approach records epicortical signals,
which are high signal-to-noise, cover large anatomical areas, and have excellent spatiotemporal resolution. We
will combine µECoG technology with a novel behavioral task for monkeys, in which they expect and choose
between different rewards. Behavioral effects of expectations are quantified by the intensity of instrumental
responses to obtain an expected outcome. We have shown that this behavior is biased by prior expectations
and slowly adjusts when contradictory information accumulates. To understand how expectations are
dynamically signaled by OFC, we will enlist cutting-edge computational methods that leverage the large-scale
nature of the µECoG recordings. We will investigate both dominant signals in OFC and subregional variation
that produce biasing expectations and update them with new information. Together, this project will provide a
uniquely holistic view of OFC function. In doing so, it will advance our understanding of expectation and bias in
motivated behavior, and lay the groundwork for future studies investigating OFC’s role in broader circuits that
integrate sensory, memory, and emotional processing to create the mental models that guide adaptive behavior."

 Parkinson's Disease (PD) is considered a “man-made” pandemic, triggered in part by industrialization
that has entailed increased production needs and exposure to toxicants resulting from that growth. Despite the
discovery of important genetic risk factors, a substantial amount of etiologic risk for idiopathic PD is
environmental, with pesticide exposure being a clear and documented risk factor. As a result, understanding
the interaction between genetic drivers and environmental risk factors has significant potential to inform
etiology and treatment of PD.
 This project will investigate how environmental factors, specifically pesticides, influence the
development of PD at the level of effects on midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, a cell type whose loss is
the hallmark of PD pathology. The work is informed by a paradigm in which highly quantitative pesticide
exposure data from a large PD cohort in California is linked to a screening platform using patient stem cell
(iPSC)-derived mDA neurons. Fifty-three pesticides were linked to PD with this method and ten proved directly
toxic to mDA neurons. The proposed work will: (1) deeply dissect mechanisms of mDA neuron toxicity for top
hits with a focus on mitochondrial and cytoskeletal consequences of trifluralin exposure; (2) explore the role of
glia in modulating toxicity using a triculture approach to ask how other PD-associated pesticides alter astrocyte
and microglial biology to influence mDA neuron pathology; and (3) use population-level modeling of sporadic
PD in a dish to build a platform that will stratify cells from ~100 donors functionally based on responses to
pesticides and then use computational methods to reconstruct which cell lines are disproportionately affected.
This will identify shared phenotypes among genetically disparate samples.
 The career development plan is designed to support the candidate's goal of becoming an independent
investigator at an academic medical center, treating PD patients in clinic while concurrently leading a research
team studying their disease. A strong mentorship and collaborative team in a vibrant research environment is
led by a supportive neurology chairperson (Batchelor), outstanding physician scientists with expertise spanning
from neurodegeneration (Khurana, Selkoe) to public health and epidemiology (Ritz) to translational
neuroscience (Rubin, Studer, Powell). This mentorship team, along with extensive research training and
relevant coursework, will position the candidate for success. The institutional resources available through
Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard University will support the candidate's career in an environment
that makes high impact contributions and collaborative endeavors achievable. The successful execution of this
proposal will position the candidate along a path for an independent career as a physician scientist studying
the interplay of gene-environment interactions in PD to better treat and prevent this disease."

Neural tube defects, including spina bifida and anencephaly, are common and severe birth defects that occur
when the neural plate, the embryonic precursor to the brain and spinal cord, fails to close during early
gestation. Folic acid fortification and supplementation have helped to reduce the global burden of neural tube
defects; however, less than 50% of neural tube defects are estimated to be attributed to known risk factors.
Arsenic contamination of drinking water continues to be a major public health threat worldwide and has been
shown to induce neural tube defects in animal models. An emerging hypothesis is that arsenic acts via the
epigenome, the multitude of compounds that affect the expression of genes without changing the underlying
DNA sequence. In this ViCTER application, we have established a team of experts in child neurology,
neurosurgery, epigenetics, developmental and molecular epidemiology, functional genomics and biostatistics
to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation mediates the neurotoxicity of arsenic on the developing nervous
system. Better understanding of the interplay of epigenetics, nutrition, and environmental arsenic exposure will
inform strategies to prevent and treat neural tube defects.
In this proposal, we establish a new basic science-clinical science consortium to assess whether arsenic
induces recognizable DNA methylation changes at loci critical for normal neural tube closure. We will utilize in
vitro methods and biological samples collected from an epidemiological study in Bangladesh to measure DNA
methylation patterns using cutting-edge methodologies, including whole genome bisulfite sequencing and the
Illumina EPIC/850K BeadChip technology. Additionally, we will investigate DNA methylation changes in genes
associated with arsenic exposure and folate status following a short course of high-dose folic acid
supplementation in women who previously conceived a child with a neural tube defect.
This interdisciplinary and collaborative study, which includes research activities spanning basic to applied
research, will seek to identify genes involved in neural tube closure that are differentially methylated in relation
to arsenic exposure and folate status. This consortium effort will accelerate the translation of findings into folic
acid-based preventive strategies to reduce the global burden of neural tube defects, particularly in areas with
high arsenic exposure."

The alveolar region of the mammalian lung is a complex, precisely structured tissue required for the primary
functions of the respiratory system, gas exchange and tissue oxygenation. Damage to the alveolar epithelium
plays a central role in human lung diseases including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a
prevalent, high impact clinical disorder that affects up to 5% of mechanically ventilated patients in the
developed world. The mortality rate of ARDS approaches 40%, and the recovery for ARDS survivors is
arduous, with a substantial burden of multi-system disability continuing 5 or more years following
hospitalization. Critically, while many ARDS survivors recover lung function, a subset of patients develops
persistently abnormal pulmonary function, imaging evidence of pulmonary scarring, and pulmonary symptoms
even years after ARDS. To date, no data exists regarding the mechanisms that guide ARDS recovery. These
challenges have been made more acute by the coronavirus pandemic, which has exposed a large proportion
of the human population to acute lung injury. An enormous population of patients is at risk of both acute and
chronic lung consequences of lung injury following coronavirus infection, emphasizing the clear and urgent
need for new regenerative therapies to promote recovery from acute lung disease.
Regeneration in many organs is driven by adult facultative progenitor cells. We recently discovered a facultative
progenitor cell in the mouse and human lung which participates in regeneration after viral injury we call alveolar
epithelial progenitors (AEPs). Progenitor cells control their chromatin carefully, as they must maintain more broad
potential than fully differentiated cells, and so a hallmark of progenitor chromatin state is regions of active
regulation between fully open and fully closed states, so called poised chromatin. Unique preliminary data from
our laboratory and review of the literature support the idea that the chromatin modifying complex PRC2 is a
critical regulator of the progenitor chromatin state of AEPs. In this application, using a combination of advanced
lung organoids and genetic mouse injury models, we will identify the temporal and functional requirements for
PRC2 function in lung progenitors, define the key binding partners and targets of the PRC2 complex in
maintenance of AEP progenitor state, and evaluate the genomic loci regulated by PRC2 complex activity
necessary for AEP-mediated alveolar regeneration. Understanding these fundamental mechanisms will provide
the framework needed to understand alveolar regenerative biology at a granular level and develop therapeutic
strategies to maintain and restore AT2 progenitor function to drive repair following infection and environmental
stress."

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma in the United States and
displays features of skeletal muscle arrested at early stages of development. The aggressive MYOD1L122R
mutated spindle/sclerosing RMS subtype accounts for 10% of pediatric diagnoses and have an extremely poor
prognosis, even despite multi-modal treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The L122R
mutation is predicted to modulate the DNA binding specificity of the Myogenic Differentiation 1 (MYOD1)
transcription factor and regulates as of yet unknown transcriptional gene programs to elevate aggression and
treatment resistance. To date, a detailed molecular understanding of how MYOD1L122R affects the genesis of
RMS, its progression and drives therapy resistance is unknown. No cellular or molecular mechanistic studies of
MYOD1L122R in RMS have been reported, no tractable genetically-engineered animal models have been
developed, nor is it known if MYOD1L122R is required for continued human tumor growth or if it is rather a
modifier of disease aggression, therapy resistance, or cancer stem cells (CSCs). The long-term goal and
objective of our studies is to identify new molecular mechanisms and drug targets in MYOD1L122R mutant RMS
that regulate aggression, therapy resistance, and CSCs. Our central hypothesis is that MYOD1L122R is a neo-
morphic transcription factor that regulates pathways required for tumor maintenance and the production of
therapy-resistant CSCs. The rationale and feasibility of our approach lies in our group’s recent discovery of
molecularly distinct CSCs in MYOD1L122R mutant RMS, robust data showing that CSCs pathways and numbers
are increased in isogenic knock-in and doxycycline-inducible MYOD1L122R RMS human cell models, and
development of a new zebrafish model of MYOD1L122R-induced RMS that has elevated numbers of tumor-
propagating cells. Aim 1 will assess roles for MYOD1L122R in enhancing tumor onset, growth, CSCs, and
therapy resistance. Aim 1a will innovate new MYOD1L122R mutant RMS zebrafish models, testing the
hypothesis that MYOD1L122R is itself not oncogenic, but drives elevated aggression only when complexed with
other oncogenic drivers including activating mutations in RAS and PIK3CA. We also hypothesize that
MYOD1L122R acts in part by increasing the overall fraction of tumor-propagating cells. Aim 1b will extend these
findings to human RMS, testing the hypothesis that MYOD1L122R is required for continued tumor maintenance
and regulates cell states including the production of therapy-resistance CSCs. Aim 2 will uncover MYOD1L122R
regulated transcriptional targets, pathways, and mechanisms in RMS, testing the hypothesis that MYOD1L122R
alters the DNA binding site specificity and transcriptionally regulates a novel set of genes to promote elevated
RMS aggression, therapy resistance, and cancer stem cell fate. This work will have a positive translational
impact by defining new pathways to kill MYOD1L122R mutant RMS, including those that target therapy-resistant
CSCs, and identifying potential therapeutic targets that are likely shared across RMS subtypes."

To meet the needs for specific study enrollment, Temple-SIREN engaged the highest volume emergency and trauma centers and the busiest EMS systems in the region. This large hub-spoke network serves very diverse populations in densely populated cities as well as highly affluent suburban areas to rural regions of Bucks and Berks counties in PA Dutch country.  Temple-SIREN Hub and spoke leaders are committed to emergency care research and are active in trials of acute cardiopulmonary and neurological illness and traumatic brain injury trials. Through collaboration and hub oversight, the Temple-SIREN group expects to significantly contribute SIREN studies' enrollment. In addition, we plan to stay ahead of the curve by translating preclinical work to the bedside and using our highly diverse regional network for studies that needs of our diverse communities.  The Temple-SIREN Hub staff will work closely with participating site investigators and coordinators from multiple disciplines to efficiently execute SIREN studies. Mechanisms to enhance efficiency and quality of clinical research across sites include use of a common informatics system to identify potential study patients; frequent communication with investigators and coordinators via webinars and conference calls; diligent site management focused on good clinical research practices and compliance, and regular Hub-spoke meetings to provide additional training by study role. Temple-SIREN investigators and coordinators will participate in SIREN clinical coordinating center and data management center and ad hoc working groups to develop SIREN studies. The Temple-SIREN Hub team would benefit from participating in this coordinated approach to emergency care research as would the people of Philadelphia and the surrounding communities served by our hospitals and EMS systems."

At presynaptic nerve terminals, the precise nano-scale positioning of two protein machineries, the active zone
and the endocytic apparatus, is critical for high fidelity synaptic transmission. The active zone, which generates
release sites for synaptic vesicles, is aligned to postsynaptic receptors to ensure efficient signal transmission.
The endocytic apparatus, which restores vesicles after release, is assembled adjacent to active zones. Most
components of these machineries are associated with brain disorders, underlining their importance for brain
function. This grant generates fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms that position the
endocytic apparatus next to the active zone at vertebrate synapses.
The presynaptic scaffold Liprin-α is an ideal candidate to spatially organize these two machineries for three
reasons. First, the broad synaptic interactome of Liprin-α and the generalized phenotypes caused by ablating
the single invertebrate gene predict that it organizes multiple presynaptic compartments. Second, my previous
work and preliminary data show that deletion of a subset of the four vertebrate Liprin-α proteins already causes
mislocalization of active zone and endocytic components, which suggests co-organizing roles for vertebrate
Liprin-α. Finally, Liprin-α undergoes phase separation, which is a potential synaptic organizing mechanism, and
my ongoing work establishes that both active zone and endocytic proteins are recruited to Liprin-α phase
condensates. Therefore, I hypothesize that Liprin-α positions the endocytic apparatus next to active zones
at vertebrate synapses.
I will use newly-generated Liprin-α quadruple mutants, in which all four Liprin-α genes can be deleted, to test
this hypothesis. Aim 1 (training) will dissect roles for Liprin-α in active zone organization by comparing the nano-
scale positioning of active zone proteins and active zone function after Liprin-α quadruple ablation in excitatory
and inhibitory synapses in cultured neurons and at the Calyx of Held. Aim 2 (training) will determine roles for
Liprin-α in organizing the endocytic apparatus by using the same approaches. Both aims will be complemented
with experiments in cell lines to assess the ability of Liprin-α to recruit endocytic and active zone proteins. I will
also do structure-function experiments to dissect the relevance of the protein sequences that mediate Liprin-α
phase separation in presynaptic assembly. These aims will establish the roles of Liprin-α in the organization of
active zones and endocytic assemblies, and will provide an essential training experience in the studies of the
endocytic machinery and in the assessment of their in vivo organization using super-resolution microscopy. Aim
3 (independent) will test the complementary model that the endocytic apparatus mediates the spatial
organization of these machineries. In particular, I will dissect structural roles for Dynamin, which is fundamental
for synaptic endocytosis, and also undergoes phase separation. I will use Dynamin triple mutants and build upon
the methodology implemented during (training) aims 1 & 2 to determine these roles."

Despite extensive research, asthma remains a difficult to treat disease with staggering economic costs.
Mechanisms in different asthmatic endotype are poorly understood. Posttranscriptional gene regulation by RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) is increasingly recognized as important control mechanisms
for pro-inflammatory genes but is understudied. RBPs, such as HuR (Elavl1), tristetraprolin (TTP) family
members which bind to mRNA AU-rich elements (ARE), play critical roles in regulating mRNA stability and
expression of key pro-inflammatory genes in asthma. HuR is a stabilizer RBP, whereas TTP family members are
destabilizer RBPs. Due to the discordance between steady-state mRNA levels and protein, purely transcriptomic
approaches may overlook critical inflammatory genes regulated by RBPs such as HuR and TTP. Yet, much of
immunity and inflammation is controlled at the posttranscriptional level by RBPs and miRNAs. Many cytokine
genes in CD4+ T cells are controlled by the balance between HuR and TTP family members. The field cannot
move forward unless we better understand how RBPs posttranscriptionally regulate pro-inflammatory gene
expression in different asthmatic endotypes. Our long-term goal is to understand posttranscriptional gene
regulation in different endotypes of asthmatic airway inflammation. The objective of this application, which is our
next step in pursuit of that goal, is to determine how HuR and TTP family members competitively regulate HuR
expression, which in turn controls CD4+ T produced cytokines in asthma. Our central hypothesis is that HuR
overproduction in type 2 high asthma is driven by an imbalance between stabilizing and destabilizing RBPs
acting upon Elavl1 mRNA to affect its stability and translation. Our data indicate that HuR is over-expressed in
type 2 high asthmatic CD4+ T cells, compared with normal controls and non-type 2 high. Furthermore, we have
shown that conditional HuR KO in T cells significantly ameliorates allergen-induced lung inflammation in murine
models. We have also demonstrated that HuR inhibition blocks Th2/Th17 secretion in asthmatic CD4+ T cells.
Up to the present, the field has focused mostly on downstream HuR targets genes. In contrast, HuR regulation
is not as well understood. The rationale for this research is that the proposed research will enable us to identify
molecular mechanisms which drive HuR over-production in the context of type 2 high asthmatic lung
inflammation. We plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish these objectives by the following two specific
aims: 1) Determine normal mechanisms of HuR expression in airway inflammation; 2) Determine molecular
mechanisms underlying HuR dysregulation in type 2 high asthma. At the completion of the proposed research,
our expected outcomes are to identify how HuR and TTP cooperate to normally control HuR expression and how
they become dysfunctional in type 2 high asthmatic CD4+ T cells. These results are expected to have a positive
impact on the field because it will further define molecular mechanisms and provide opportunities to develop
novel therapies to treat asthma."

Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a common genetic form of intellectual disability that is frequently co-morbid
with autism-like clinical features. It is caused by epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes for
the protein FMRP, an RNA binding protein with a strong preference for mRNAs important in synaptic
structure and function. Indeed, there are well-documented synaptic defects observed in both human patients
and in the mouse model for FXS (Fmr1 knockout). In excitatory pyramidal neurons, these synaptic defects
are well-described but much less is known about the remaining 20% of cortical neurons, inhibitory cortical
interneurons, in FXS. Since interneuron dysfunction has been implicated in both schizophrenia as well as
ASD, they are an appealing cell population to study in the context of FXS. Our Central Hypothesis is that
cortical interneurons dysfunction plays an important role in FXS etiology and that interneuron phenotypes
can be revealed at the cell type numbers, distribution and synaptic levels. In this proposal, we will conduct
a multi-level analysis of interneurons in Fmr1-/- mice using a number of novel approaches that we recently
developed. The proposed work is Highly Significant in that interneurons are poorly understood in the
context of FXS despite their importance in the etiology of other neurodevelopmental disorders. The work
is also Highly Innovative because it brings to bear a number of novel approaches to unearth interneuron
phenotypes in FXS: detailed spatial analysis of interneuron distribution and machine learning strategies to
examine interneurons synapses at the individual and population level. First, we will use automated seg-
mentation and positional registration to study interneuron subtype numbers, layering and cortical distribu-
tion in Fmr1-/- and controls. Second, we will employ a novel machine learning pipeline to measure inter-
neuron synaptic target specificity in Fmr1 mutant and controls. Third, we will - in a manner similar to
single cell RNA-seq principle component analysis - analyze individual synaptic boutons by multidimen-
sional spatial feature analysis. This allows us to perform unsupervised cluster analysis of interneuron syn-
aptic boutons and reveal population level differences between Fmr1-/- and control synapses. Taken together,
our data will shed new light on an understudied cell population – cortical interneurons - in FXS etiology
and open new avenues of investigation into synaptic defects underlying FXS and ASD."

Congenital Melanocytic Nevi (CMN) can reach giant sizes, transform to childhood melanoma, and thus trigger
pre-emptive surgery inducing profound morbidity. In the prior funding period, we constructed four CMN models
to test regression-inducing treatments aimed at avoiding surgery. Three are genetically engineered mice driven
by the (floxed)NRASQ61R oncogene, responsible for most human CMN, with melanocyte-targeting via tamoxifen-
inducible or constitutive expression from Tyr or Dct promoters (varied strengths). The fourth model is xenografted
resected human CMNs on immunodeficient mice. Several models displayed melanoma transformation after long
latency. Inducible NRASQ61R clarified the kinetics of proliferative vs senescent nevus phases and verified
regressive treatments to succeed in either phase. Tyr-Cre;NRASQ61R exhibited severe human-like CNS and skin
lesions whereas the weaker Dct-Cre induced a more typical skin-restricted giant nevi for which inhibitors of MEK,
PI3K, or cKIT induced incomplete (~80%) regressions and combinations fully depleted visual nevocytes. Topical
treatment with the proinflammatory hapten Squaric Acid Dibutyl Ester (SADBE) induced complete visual CMN
regression after 3 doses. This regimen also fully prevented murine melanoma transformation, within all treated
nevus skin. We found that topical SADBE requires macrophages (not B, T, or NK cells), so it could be tested in
human CMN xenografted onto SHO mice (which lack adaptive immunity but retain macrophages). SADBE
recruited murine macrophages into the human xenografts and regressed ~90% of the human nevocytes. Since
SADBE is already used elsewhere in dermatology, and has been reported to induce “depigmentation,” we plan
to test it clinically. However, since clinical trials with efficacy endpoints are not supported in R01s from NIAMS,
we are seeking separate funding to support this clinical trial that already received FDA/IND and IRB approvals.
While we are excited by the models and strategies uncovered during this funding period, we believe it is crucial
to build on this progress to increase the likelihood of achieving real therapeutic breakthrough for this devastating
children’s disease. Accordingly Aims 1-3 use our models to boldly seek further enhanced efficacy and minimized
toxicity of treatments: Aim 1 deeply and systematically develops kinase inhibitor combinations. It also tests MEK
inhibitors (MEKi) with SADBE, as both exhibit individual efficacy and MEKi was recently shown to promote M1-
like (pro-inflammatory) over M2-like macrophage differentiation, a mechanistic feature that may enhance
SADBE’s efficacy. Aim 2 seeks localized T cell adaptive immunity recruitment, to complement SADBE’s
macrophage induction. We have shown anti-PD1 triggers recruitment of melanocyte (gp100) targeted T-cells
when combined with topical SADBE. We will also combine fractional laser treatment plus anti-PD1 which, as we
recently published, also triggers local recruitment of melanocyte-targeted T-cells. Aim 3 systematically uses our
models to test varied dose/schedules of anti-inflammatory approaches that are commonly used in infants, to
optimize SADBE’s nevus regression efficacy while minimizing cutaneous toxicity and inflammatory symptoms."

The field of data science has exploded in growth within the biomedical sciences in recent years, driven in part 
by artificial intelligence approaches using trained neural networks to analyze large data sets. Existing high- 
performance computing resources will be consolidated and expanded at the University of Arkansas to establish 
a Data Science Core in the proposed Arkansas Integrative Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC). The Data 
Science Core will be a unique core created to meet the research needs of the AIMRC and is an essential 
component of the research projects proposed by the COBRE project leaders. A team of four data scientists will 
be assembled that have broad expertise to provide data science support for AIMRC. The Data Science Core will 
coordinate closely with the AIMRC Bioenergetics and Imaging and Spectroscopy Cores to provide artificial 
intelligence-based approaches to elucidate relationships between large imaging, bioenergetics, genomic, and 
proteomic data sets, which can ultimately be used to predict and understand metabolic phenotypes and their 
role in disease. This coordinated core structure will allow data analytics to be integrated into a cross-disciplinary 
framework capable of supporting the entire range of technologies and expertise needed for an effective metabolic 
systems research. Close interaction between the Data Science Core and COBRE Center project leaders will 
also lead to new innovations in research that will benefit future COBRE investigators as well as the broader

AIMRC members, the campus and researchers in Arkansas."
10738808,"Antibodies that do not promote the destruction of pathogens in situ or prevent their internalization into target cells
through opsonization are nevertheless key factors in immunity against intracellular pathogens. An important mechanism
by which such “non-neutralizing” antibodies (nNAbs) curtail certain infections has been illuminated by the recent
discovery of antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization (ADIN). In ADIN, cytosolic nNAbs bound to pathogens are
recognized by the intracellular high-affinity Fc receptor Trim21 and the complex is degraded by the proteasome. ADIN
has been found capable of eradicating an enveloped virus. Given that enveloped viruses shed bound antibodies upon cell
membrane fusion, the means by which nNAbs access the cytosol is puzzling. That nNAbs access the cytosol in vivo but not
in vitro suggests that culture models lack a critical cell or factor for nNAb entry.
 Herpes simplex viruses (HSV)-1 and -2 initially replicate in a lytic manner at mucosal surfaces but then establish life-
long residence within ganglion neurons of the peripheral nervous system. In neuronal nuclei the viral genome enters
latency, a state of quiescence in which replication is repressed and lytic proteins are produced at near-undetectable levels.
As mature neurons are non-renewable and unchecked viral replication can lead to central nervous system damage, the
control of latency is critical to the host. Ganglia are monitored by CD8+ T-cells, which deliver granzyme B at the
immunological synapse with infected neurons via perforin pores. Cytosolic granzyme B digests ICP4, an essential
transcriptional regulator. The model is therefore that without ICP4 to upregulate transcript production, latency is
perpetuated. Our data show that ICP4 antibodies exist in seropositive human trigeminal ganglia, suggestive of a check on
ICP4 expression by granzyme B and possibly by antibodies to ICP4 that mediate its ADIN.
 We hypothesize that antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization of ICP4 limits HSV-1 reactivation. We will
address this in experiments of two Specific Aims: 1) assess whether antibodies gain access to the neuronal cytosol through
the close interaction between CD8+-T-cells and latently-infected neurons; and 2) determine whether non-neutralizing
antibodies direct ADIN of ICP4 produced during latent neuronal infection, stifling viral reactivation. We will use convergent
approaches to benefit from both an in vivo → ex vivo mouse model of human HSV-1 latency, and an in vitro model of
latent HSV-1 infection in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. If successful, Aim 1 will define a
heretofore undescribed route of nNAb entry into cells in the context of HSV-1 latency. Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular
basis of the complex balance between viral latency and host immunity. If successful, this R21 study will shift the focus of
HSV vaccine target design to accommodate a role for ADIN in anti-viral immunity, and indicate potential therapeutic
targets including inhibitors of reactivation, or agonists of ADIN. Advances from our studies could also inform far-reaching
approaches to antagonize human pathogens with a latency state including HIV, HCMV, MeV, and EBV."

Transition-age (TA) adulthood—between ages 18 to 25—is a distinct and critical developmental period where
unique biological, psychological, and social changes are occurring. Brain development continues into the latter
part of this period, with neurological structures associated with reward sensitivity and self-regulation continuing
to form. Social roles are in flux, with reduced parental monitoring and shifts in societal expectations that
presage lifetime functioning at the personal, familial, and community levels. Substance use disorders (SUD)
and mental health conditions are more prevalent in this age group than at other ages, 14.4% and 29.4%
respectively in 2019. Effective treatment at this age has the potential for large long-term payoffs. Over the past
decade, there has been a large rise in the prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUD) among TA adults. Yet, the
treatment system for OUD performs poorly for TA adults: they are less likely to obtain scientifically supported
treatment and more likely to leave treatment early. Although the most efficacious treatment for OUD is
pharmacotherapy, naturalistic studies demonstrate that there are large gaps in receipt of medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD), low adherence to these medications, and poor outcomes for most TA adults who enter
treatment. Few current studies of quality in OUD treatment programs account for individual, organizational, and
contextual factors that vary over time. In particular, variation in the quality of treatment programs occurs within
the complex interplay of social and ecological factors related to communities, treatment programs, and
characteristics of the patient. Specifically, social determinants of health, such as poverty and racial/ethnic
disparities, create added barriers to obtaining and sustaining scientifically supported treatments. A better
understanding of the program characteristics associated with higher quality care for TA adults with OUD will
inform organizational changes, payer incentives, and government policies to improve treatment for this poorly
served population. Because of rapid organizational changes caused by the COVID-19 public health
emergency, there is an opportunity to explore whether new forms of SUD treatment delivery—telehealth,
liberalization in provision of pharmacotherapy—lead to improved treatment engagement and outcomes for TA
adults. The proposed longitudinal study will combine data from multiple sources, including Medicaid and a
state registry of SUD treatment episodes, to examine three aspects of OUD treatment quality for approximately
65,000 TA adults entering treatment for OUD between 2012 and 2025: 1) access to MOUD; 2) adherence to
pharmacotherapy and retention in treatment; and 3) adverse events (e.g., overdoses). To guide our study, we
propose a conceptual model that draws from the Donabedian quality of care framework (Organizational
Structure>Clinical Process>Outcome) and from social ecology to examine program quality of OUD treatment
for TA adults while accounting for individual and community level factors associated with the ability of these
programs to deliver care."

This application seeks to advance statistical methods within the Bayesian inferential paradigm for disease map-
ping and spatial boundary analysis. Disease mapping is an epidemiological technique used to describe the
geographic variation of disease and to generate etiological hypotheses about the possible causes for apparent
differences in risk. The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in disease mapping, with recent method-
ological developments in advanced spatial statistics and increasing availability of computerized Geographic In-
formation Systems (GIS) technology. Spatial biostatisticians, data scientists and epidemiologists today routinely
encounter datasets requiring multi- or high-dimensional disease mapping in the presence of spatial-temporal
misalignment, where “dimension” refers to (a) the number of cancer types being studied, (b) the number of spa-
tial units (e.g., census-tracts, counties) in the map, and (c) the number of temporal units (time points) at which
the data are observed. This application offers novel classes of stochastic process-based graphical models with
speciﬁc attention to spatially-temporally misaligned data and modeling of multiple cancers. The versatility and
scalability of the proposed framework will allow epidemiologists and public health researchers to account for
information from multiple sources including, but not limited to, environmental factors and climate-related vari-
ables at arbitrary resolutions in spatial-temporal “BIG DATA” settings. The proposal will subsequently develop
a rigorous framework for multivariate boundary detection on maps, where boundaries delineate regions with
signiﬁcantly different spatial effects."
10782479,"The overall goal of this project is to apply novel approaches to probe local neuronal activity in cerebral cortex
associated with complex, natural sensory experience and to determine how general anesthetics may alter
sensory-specific contents of consciousness. Our general hypothesis is that anesthetic modulation of
consciousness is closely tied to the modification of specific spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in local
cortical circuits. We will test our hypothesis in the rat visual and association cortex as a model system in vivo.
We propose three specific aims. In the first aim, we will use multineuronal recording with chronically
implanted microelectrode arrays to determine stereotypic neuronal firing sequences that conform to moving
visual stimuli presented by virtual reality projection while the subject is allowed run on a spherical treadmill
along a virtual path. We will examine how anesthetics at incremental doses may influence both spontaneous
and visual stimulus-related firing sequences, comparing behaviorally defined conscious and unconscious
states. We hypothesize that navigating virtual reality will induce reproducible spatiotemporal sequences of
neuron ensembles and that sensory specificity of these sequences would be reduced by anesthetics particularly
at a dose they produce observable signs of unconsciousness. In the second aim, we will apply electrical
microstimulation to elicit reproducible local network activity patterns and map the effective connectivity of
neuronal networks. We hypothesize that input-specific multineuronal firing sequences will be stabilized by
repeated stimulation, will be spontaneously replayed in the absence of stimulation as a result of network
plasticity and that anesthesia will degrade but not necessarily abolish all stimulus-selective sequences. In the
third aim, multichannel recording and microstimulation will be combined with an adaptive artificial neuronal
network model to create a closed-loop hybrid brain-to-brain assay of visual stimulus-specific information
transfer between two virtual reality-embedded subjects. This will be a novel attempt to read out meaningful
sensory neuronal information from a subject's brain and transfer it to another subject as a task performance
agent to use it for an assessment of the first subject's state of consciousness. In all aims, we will use four drugs
representing four canonical pharmacological classes of anesthetics: desflurane, propofol, dexmedetomidine,
and ketamine to find a common, agent-invariant neuronal correlate of unconsciousness. The proposed project
builds upon our two decades-long integrative investigations into the neuronal mechanisms of anesthesia at
systems level. The work should advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of consciousness and
anesthesia. The anticipated results should augment our basic science knowledge that may lead, on the long
term, to the development of improved bedside-applicable monitoring of the state of consciousness during
general anesthesia and in patients with disorders of consciousness. They may also inspire new approaches to
ameliorate deficits and replace or restore neural functions in patients with physical or mental disabilities."
10756520,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor 5-year survival rate of 6% for patients
with metastatic disease. There are no targeted therapies for these patients. Unfortunately, current treatments
only slow disease progression for an average of 5 months, after which drug resistance quickly develops. As
such, there is a critical need to identify new targets of intervention and develop new treatments for ACC. ACC
can be characterized by significant heterogeneity both intertumorally between patients and intratumorally within
an individual tumor, making choosing an effective therapeutic strategy challenging. Several mechanistic
pathways have been identified that may correlate with disease progression: IGF2, Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt), and cell
cycle regulating pathways such as p53/retinoblastoma protein (Rb) are dysregulated in 90% of ACC, and
correlate with metastatic disease. Unfortunately, the intratumoral heterogeneity of IGF2, Wnt, and p53/Rb
dysregulation and its contributions to ACC tumor progression is unknown, although each of these pathways has
been implicated or correlated with tumor invasion, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, or metastasis in
other cancers. This lack of understanding can partially be attributed to the lack of appropriate preclinical research
models. Most attempts to generate ACC models have been unsuccessful. The small number of existing models
do not adequately reflect the oncogenic signaling pathways and intratumoral heterogeneity of human ACC. A
human-based ACC model system permitting functional and transcriptomic characterization of tumor
subpopulations following metastasis does not exist. To address these critical research gaps, we developed the
first patient-derived organoids (PTOs) from patient samples as well as an ACC metastasis-on-a-chip (MOC)
platform. Our MOC platform is an in vitro microfluidic system that incorporates tumor organoids, recirculating
fluid flow, and downstream tissue organoids, which can recapitulate aspects of metastasis from a primary tumor
site to metastatic sites. In addition, we have developed MMP peptide biosensor technology that integrates into
our organoids, enabling near-real time observation of MMP-mediated tumor cell invasion. We will deploy this
platform to sort tumor cells into metastatic/motile versus non-metastatic/less motile subpopulations for analysis
of expression of dysregulated pathways in ACC (IGF2, Wnt, and p53/Rb) and subpopulation heterogeneity
determined by single cell RNA sequencing. We hypothesize that IGF2, Wnt, and cell cycle dysregulation
correlates with increased metastasis kinetics and MMP activity in ACC PTOs deployed in our MOC platform.
Towards this hypothesis: Aim 1 will delineate metastasis kinetics, MMP activity, and proliferation of ACC PTO
cells; Aim 2 will define ACC intratumoral heterogeneity of critical oncogenic pathway dysregulation using single
cell-RNA-sequencing; Aim 3 will determine the relative importance of each driver pathway on metastatic potential
through drug-based inhibition. Upon completion of this project, we aim to both better understand ACC disease
biology and have an established model of ACC that can be deployed for preclinical studies."

Malaria disease remains a serious public health problem. Progress in Malaria control has slowed
in recent years while resistance to frontline antimalarials is emerging in the most afflicted regions,
underscoring a pressing need to decipher the fundamental biology of the parasite to provide novel
therapeutic options. During the pathogenic blood stage, malaria parasites develop within a
protective vacuole inside host erythrocytes. Export of effector proteins out of the vacuole remodels
the host cell to create a niche for replication while transport of nutrients across this barrier fuels
rapid parasite growth. Both of these processes depend on a vacuole membrane pore formed by
the parasite protein EXP2, which allows small molecule exchange between the host cytosol and
vacuole and is also assembled into the PTEX complex to mediate translocation of effector
proteins into the host cell. While these mechanisms are critical to parasite survival and disease
pathogenesis, it is unknown how EXP2/PTEX function is specifically established in the vacuole
membrane. We recently identified an interaction between EXP2/PTEX and UIS2, a secreted
parasite protein that also localizes to the vacuole. Preliminary observations suggest UIS2 is an
integral protein of the vacuolar membrane and conditional knockdown of UIS2 in Plasmodium
falciparum revealed an essential function in protein export. We hypothesize that UIS2 is
required to establish EXP2 function in the PVM, critically enabling both protein export and
nutrient uptake. UIS2 contains a purple acid phosphatase domain but is unlikely to be
catalytically active as it appears to be missing several key metal coordinating residues. Aim 1 will
study the membrane association and topology of UIS2 and evaluate the catalytic activity of the
phosphatase domain in vitro and its importance to UIS2 function in vivo. Aim 2 will investigate the
function of UIS2 in transport across the vacuolar membrane by determining its precise impact on
EXP2 and formation of the nutrient pore. These studies will define the role of UIS2 in PVM
transport processes critical to parasite survival and Malaria pathology. Intriguingly, UIS2 is broadly
conserved among vacuole-dwelling apicomplexans and the Toxoplasma ortholog of UIS2, known
as GRA44, is also critical to an analogous but mechanistically distinct protein export pathway.
Thus UIS2/GRA44 may represent a unifying feature of the vacuolar export machinery in these
diverse apicomplexans that could suggest novel, widely applicable control strategies for this
important group of pathogens."
10753577,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large class of positive-strand RNA viruses that are capable of causing severe
human disease and death, as is exemplified by the pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The innate immune
response to coronavirus infection includes a battle between poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) and the
coronavirus macrodomain (Mac1), which add and remove ADP-ribose from proteins, respectively. In the
absence of Mac1 enzyme activity, CoVs replicate poorly in the face of the innate immune response and cause
little to no disease in several animal models of infection, including SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate
the power of PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation to limit CoV-induced disease and support our central
hypothesis that PARPs target host and viral proteins, and that the post-translational modification of these
targets (MARylation) induces an antiviral state that limits virus replication. Despite the clear importance of
PARP enzymes in driving the outcome of a CoV infection, a large gap in knowledge remains as to exactly how
this battle plays out during CoV infections, most notably i) what PARPs are heavily involved in this battle; and
ii) what cellular or viral proteins are ADP-ribosylated during infection. Functional redundancy, similar NAD+
binding sites, low protein abundance, and viral enzymes that reverse their effects have made it challenging to
identify direct targets of individual PARPs during coronavirus infection.
The objective of this proposal is to identify specific ADP-ribosylated targets of PARPs during a SARS-CoV-2
infection that will uncover novel mechanisms of virus restriction. This objective will be resolved with the
following specific aims: 1) Identify PARPs proteins that are expressed during and impact SARS-CoV-2
infection, and 2) Identify viral and cellular PARP targets using chemical genetics and proximity labeling. This
work is innovative because we will apply, for the first time, NAD+-based chemical proteomics, chemical
genetics, and BioID proximity labeling to uncover the specific targets of of MARylating PARPs that impact
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we have a unique tool, a virus that lacks the ability to counter PARP
activity, to aid in our identification of physiologically relevant PARP target proteins. Our rationale is that
identifying the targets of individual PARPs during SARS-CoV-2 infection will define novel mechanisms of virus
restriction that will dramatically expand the landscape of ADP-ribosylation and how it can impact virus
replication. Together, with our combined expertise in chemistry, PARP/ADP-ribose, and CoV biology, we are
poised to address these challenges and make seminal discoveries describing novel targets of PARP-mediated
ADP-ribosylation and how they can drive antiviral innate immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
anticipate identifying dozens of ADP-ribosylated proteins during infection, which will alter the landscape of how
PTMs, outside of phosphorylation or ubiquitination, can impact the outcomes of virus infections, and will
provide new avenues for antiviral therapy."

gyrus, part of the ventral visual pathway that contains the fusiform face area (FFA). The FFA is important for
recognizing faces and undergoes changes in its structure in response to experience-dependent learning of faces,
which is ubiquitous in the first year when infants are exposed to caregivers’ faces. This early learning of faces
constitutes a foundational proto-social skill upon which social cognition builds. The FFA is defined by its
functional response to faces using functional MRI (fMRI), making its study in young infants challenging as they
usually cannot be scanned while awake. However, a reliable anatomical landmark, the mid-fusiform sulcus
(MFS), specifies the location of FFA in over 80% of brains studied to date. The average and peak depth of
cortical sulci, as well as the thickness of cortex in their banks, have been shown in other studies to predict
functional properties of the cortex. Thus, we will use a rich publicly available resource, the IBIS dataset, which
comprises structural MRI scans at 6, 12, and 24 months from infants at high and low risk of developing autism,
to investigate the structure of the MFS and surrounding cortex. In Aim I, we will characterize its typical longitudinal
development, and in Aim II, we will test for group differences in its structure and the developmental trajectory of
its growth and predictive association of its structure with clinical measures of social communication and
socialization. The outcome of this project will shed light on the developmental timing of early visual experience
related to social skills development, and has the potential to lead to a novel biomarker reflecting early face
learning ability that could provide a new target for early intervention approaches."

Dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel impedes mucus
clearance and leads to the airway disease, cystic fibrosis (CF). New CFTR modulators improve mucociliary
transport (MCT) and pathophysiologic manifestations of the disease in genetic mutation-specific patients, but
do not completely restore airway function. We recently discovered ginsenosides derived from Korean Red
Ginseng serve as potentiators of the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC) [TMEM16A] and can restore MCT in
vitro and in vivo through this alternative Cl- pathway. Yet, poor clinical trial results with activators of TMEM16A
and a recently described role for the channel in mucus hypersecretion in infected airways has led to some to
suggest that inhibiting TMEM16A is a better strategy. However, we hypothesize that potentiating TMEM16A,
rather than channel activation through purinergic, intracellular Ca2+- driven pathways, will rescue MCT in
infected CF airways. Specific Aim 1 will isolate the ginsenoside that most effectively potentiates TMEM16A and
measure its effects on MCT parameters and mucus pathology. We anticipate finding the optimal ginsenoside
through Ussing chamber and patch clamp experiments, while also measuring the impact on markers of MCT
and mucus viscosity. Specific Aim 2 will assess whether a TMEM16A potentiator improves epithelial Cl-
secretion, histopathology, and MCT parameters in infected CF rat airways. We will determine single dose
pharmacokinetics for the selected ginsenoside and administer to Pseudomonas-infected CF rats to evaluate
nasal potential difference, MCT, lung micro-CTs, histopathology, mucus properties (viscosity, solids, mass,
density), and inflammatory cytokines. We will answer questions about the therapeutic utility of targeting the
TMEM16A pathway and identify a new TMEM16A potentiator as an effective treatment for CF airway disease."

Injury is the leading cause of loss of independence among those over the age 65, resulting in over 3 million
Emergency Department (ED) visits, 800,000 hospitalizations, and greater than $50 billion in costs each year.
Guideline-concordant triage of trauma patients – rapid identification of those with severe injuries and transfer to
trauma centers – decreases mortality by 10 to 25%, reduces loss of independence, and diminishes pain at one
year. Despite this evidence, however, under-triage persists (incidence: 50%), particularly among those over the
age of 65 (incidence: 80%). To address this implementation gap, we propose to conduct a Type I hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial in which we test the effect of video game-based training on physician
behavior. We designed this trial based on extensive preliminary studies, during which we isolated physician
behavior as the single largest source of variation in triage practices, identified heuristics (pattern recognition)
as a major cause of behavior, developed theory-based, customized video games to recalibrate physician
heuristics (i.e., align them with clinical practice guidelines), and ensured their efficacy in the laboratory. For this
trial, we will recruit a national sample of emergency medicine physicians (n=900), in collaboration with three
large staffing organizations, and will randomize physicians to one of three interventions: video game-based
training, text-based education (active control), or nothing (passive control). The specific aims of the trial are (1)
to test the effect of the three interventions on behavioral (e.g., under-triage) and patient-centered outcomes
(e.g., 30-day mortality) by linking trial data to Medicare claims, (2) to compare the mechanisms of action by
which the active interventions affect physician behavior by using a suite of validated instruments, and (3) to
identify contextual factors that influence implementation and maintenance of guidelines in practice by
performing a comprehensive qualitative evaluation of trial participants (n=20) and a national sample of key
decision makers (e.g., ED directors, patients [n=20/group]). Together these aims will provide critical insight into
the effectiveness of our novel intervention and key data to inform future implementation efforts."
10794357,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
 Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles that change shape, size and abundance in response to
specific stimuli. Protein interactions that control mitochondrial division are tightly regulated and directly impact
ATP production, Ca2+ homeostasis, and regulation of programmed cell death. Therefore, mitochondrial
dynamics has recently come to the forefront as a therapeutic target in several degenerative diseases, including
neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. But the lack of insight into the regulation of this
process is a major limitation. The major driver of mitochondrial division is a cytosolic GTPase, dynamin-related
protein 1 (Drp1). To mediate membrane scission, Drp1 recruitment and self-assembly is coordinated through
combinatorial interactions with lipids, proteins and nucleotides at the surface of mitochondria. This proposal
seeks to identify key attributes of the mitochondrial division machinery and how dysregulation of Drp1 leads to
organelle damage and cellular degeneration. This will be accomplished using a multifaceted approach that
combines molecular studies with functional cell experiments to provide a comprehensive evaluation of Drp1
interactions that govern membrane remodeling. Under Specific Aim 1 of the renewal, cryo-EM studies will
examine auto-inhibitory interactions that limit Drp1 oligomerization in a cytosolic state. Distinct conformations
will be studied to identify and characterize intermediate structures during recruitment and assembly of Drp1
into a functional fission complex. We propose that regulated rearrangements “open” the molecule for functional
assembly at defined sites of mitochondrial division. For Specific Aim 2, reconstitution experiments provide a
means to evaluate macromolecular interactions that drive mitochondrial membrane remodeling. Specific
mitochondrial cues, including lipids and partner proteins, will be studied to evaluate the contribution of each
component to membrane remodeling. Constriction of protein-lipid tubules will be encouraged to evaluate the
magnitude of constriction using advanced structural methods. Liquid-EM will visualize dynamic narrowing of
Drp1-lipid tubules in real time, and cryo-ET will be used to resolve 3D structures of assorted Drp1 constriction
events in parallel. In Specific Aim 3, defects in mitochondrial fission will be examined at the cellular level to
establish how deleterious changes in Drp1 can directly influence mitochondrial bioenergetics. The integrity of
ETC complexes will be studied to reveal how altered organelle morphology informs metabolic stress.
Concurrently, the impact of this stress on ROS signaling and mitophagy will be monitored. In summary, the
structural and functional insight gained from this proposal will catalyze directed therapeutic strategies that
counteract mitochondrial damage in various disease states."

Aerobic exercise is a promising treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD), but
exercise trials have shown mixed effects on cognition, physical function, behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD), quality of life (QoL), and caregiver burden. These findings are likely due to
Individual differences in aerobic-fitness responses, long established in adults using peak oxygen consumption
(VO2peak) and first reported in older adults with ADRD by our team. AD/ADRD exercise trials report large
variance in VO2peak changes from moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). Mechanistically, animal
studies support aerobic exercise modifying AD’s AT(N) biomarkers (Amyloid-beta [Aβ], Tau, and
Neurodegeneration), but similar human studies are rare. Hence, precision exercise is critical to identify MICT
non-response early to initiate alternative interventions (High Intensity Interval Training [HIIT] or Combined
Aerobic and Resistance Exercise [CARE]). Because VO2peak can improve and peak from 3-month MICT, it is
logical to use VO2peak at 3 months to identify non-response and initiate HIIT or CARE. This Phase II, pilot trial
will be a Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial. Its purpose is to test the effects of 6-month
aerobic exercise on aerobic fitness and its mechanisms of action in community-dwelling older adults with mild
AD dementia. Our central hypothesis is that MICT augmented with HIIT or CARE will improve aerobic fitness,
white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and plasma biomarkers, which underlie exercise’s cognitive effects. This
trial builds on our previous work showing: successful recruitment, retention, adherence, and safety; 6-month
MICT maintained memory and reduced WMH; individual differences in VO2peak and cognitive responses to
MICT; MICT improved physical function, QoL, and caregiver distress; plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL)
predicted cognition; and MICT affected plasma p-tau181. It will randomize 108 participants 2:1 to 3-month
MICT or 6-month stretching control after baseline. VO2peak will be assessed after 3-month MICT to identify non-
responders (<5% increase) and re-randomize them 1:1 to HIIT or CARE for 3 months. Responders will
continue MICT for 3 months. Participants will be followed for another 6 months. Primary outcomes are aerobic
fitness measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and WMH volume at 0, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes
(memory, physical function, BPSD, QoL, caregiver burden) and plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, t-tau, and NfL will be
assessed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. This trial has 80% power for all primary hypotheses, assuming 18% and
25% attrition at 6 and 12 months, respectively. The specific aims are to: I) test the effects of aerobic exercise
on aerobic fitness, WMH volume, and patient-centered outcomes in older adults with mild AD dementia; II) the
best exercise to improve aerobic fitness and reduce non-responses over 6 months in older adults with mild AD
dementia; and III) examine the mechanisms of aerobic exercise’s action on memory in mild AD dementia. This
trial is the first precision-exercise trial in AD, and will utilize MRI/blood biomarkers, which are scalable."
10770389,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an intraocular pressure (IOP) related, progressive optic neuropathy
that ultimately leads to blindness. Permanent visual field loss from POAG is a condition of public health
significance worldwide. The etiology of POAG is poorly understood and primary prevention is not possible.
Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a modifiable risk factor, however, many individuals have IOP elevation
without optic nerve disease , and at least 33% of POAG cases have progressive retinal ganglion cell loss
despite IOP measurements in the normal range, a condition defined as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).
Preventative or neuro-protective therapies for glaucoma are not yet available and little is known about the
molecular events that influence susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration. The overall goal of
our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG allowing for implementation of effective screening and
prevention strategies and development of novel therapies. POAG has significant heritability and recent
genome-wide association studies, including our NEIGHBORHOOD GWAS, have identified 30 POAG loci
defined by common genomic variants. However, in addition to common variants the complex POAG genetic
architecture is likely to also include contributions from rare coding variants that implicate specific genes in
disease pathogenicity, as has been discovered for other complex traits. Large-scale studies of rare coding
variation in glaucoma populations have not yet been done. The focus of this competing renewal is to
comprehensively examine the contributions of coding variation to POAG and the HTG and NTG subgroups
with a primary goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets and specifically those with neuro-protective
potential. For the next funding period we propose the following specific aims: 1) Obtain high quality whole
exome sequence (WES) data for POAG cases and controls using state-of-the-art sequencing and robust
variant calling and annotation pipelines; 2) Assess contribution of rare coding variants to POAG and to NTG
and HTG subgroups; and 3) Build a web-based platform for data analysis, data-sharing and communication."
10770393,"Project Summary/Abstract
High-throughput sequencing assays allow scientists to measure biochemical properties like transcription factor
binding, histone modiﬁcations, and gene expression in nearly any cell line or primary tissue (“biosample”).
Unfortunately, measuring all possible biochemical properties in every biosample is infeasible, both because of
limited sample availability and because the cost would be prohibitive. We have previously developed a state-of-
the-art imputation method, called Avocado, that can ﬁll in the holes in such data sets. Avocado couples tensor
factorization with a deep neural network. The method is scalable to large data sets and provides more accurate
imputations than competing methods such as ChromImpute or PREDICTD. We have already applied Avocado
systematically to the NIH ENCODE data set and made the imputations publicly available via the ENCODE web
por tal.
 Here, we propose to extend Avocado in four important ways. First, we will extend Avocado to handle single-cell
data sets, thereby effectively turning each single-cell experiment into an in silico co-assay that measures multiple
properties of each cell in parallel. Second, we will extend Avocado to work with data such as Hi-C, which measures
three-dimensional properties of DNA. The extension involves converting Avocado's 3D tensor (biosample assay
 genomic position) to a 4D tensor with two genomic position axes. This extension will apply to a wide variety
of data types, including various types of Hi-C data, SPRITE, GAM, ChIA-PET and PLAC-seq. Third, we will
enhance Avocado to use variant aware genomic sequence to enable high-resolution imputation of regulatory
proﬁles. Finally, we will leverage the imputed data to infer cis-regulatory sequence annotations and the molecular
impact of regulatory non-coding variants in one of the most comprehensive collections of cellular contexts.
 All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and latent
factorizations will be made publicly available via the web portals associated with the NIH 4D Nucleome and
ENCODE Consortia, providing a valuable public resource for users of these data sets."

Overview: In 2020, over 276,000 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and over 48,000 will
die from it. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide fast, accurate, accessible non-contrast-enhanced MRI
screening methods to safely detect breast cancer in the high-risk population.
Relevance: Screening mammography is successful in reducing breast cancer mortality, but misses many
important cancers, especially in women with a high risk of breast cancer, and in the 27 million women with dense
breasts who undergo screening. MRI has been shown to be more than twice as sensitive for screening in many
scenarios, but high cost, discomfort, and poor compliance due to the need for IV gadolinium-based contrast
agents with side effects limit its impact for screening. This project aims to change this paradigm by developing a
rapid, inexpensive, comfortable, non-contrast-enhanced breast MRI screening exam.
Approach: Based on substantial prior work, our group will develop high-resolution 3D and 2D diffusion MRI
methods that can depict important morphologic features and quantify diffusion heterogeneity in breast lesions.
To support these methods, we will ﬁrst implement ﬂexible, closely-ﬁtting soft breast coil arrays that maximize
SNR and parallel imaging capabilities while reducing positioning time and increasing comfort. We will combine
the efﬁciency and motion-insensitivity of non-Cartesian 3D cones imaging with the double-echo steady-state dif-
fusion approach to offer efﬁcient 3D diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Additionally, we will redesign echo-planar
imaging (EPI) DWI including asymmetric encoding with bulk motion insensitivity, full k-space readouts, and novel
locally low-rank reconstruction to provide high-resolution quantitative DWI that is robust to small patient motion.
Finally, collaborating with two other major centers, we will study these methods in high-risk screening patients,
aiming to demonstrate improved non-contrast-enhanced sensitivity from 45% to over 70% among women with
negative mammograms, while retaining speciﬁcity over 91%. If successful, these rates are sufﬁcient to make
non-contrast-enhanced MRI screening viable for clinical use.
Summary: Using advances to 2D and 3D DWI, combined with ﬂexible coil arrays, we aim to provide accurate,
low-cost, comfortable, MRI screening without intravenous contrast, in a 10 minute exam. This will ultimately en-
able more effective and comfortable breast cancer screening for millions women for whom x-ray mammography
is insufﬁcient."
10753446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutations in the muscle-specific splicing factor RBM20 are a recently identified cause of aggressive dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by severe arrhythmias. However, the underlying mechanisms are still
unclear, and thus no therapies are available. Our group recently discovered a nuclear “splicing factory” involving
RBM20 hotspots, which brings into proximity multiple co-regulated loci from different chromosomes. Formation
of this three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure relies the nucleation of RBM20 foci by its main splicing target,
the pre-mRNA encoding for the giant protein titin (TTN). Ablating TTN transcription disrupts the RBM20 splicing
factory and dysregulates the alternative splicing of genes involved in calcium handling, including the L-type
calcium channel (CACNA1C) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D). Thus, the
central hypothesis tested in this proposal is that RBM20 assembles membraneless macromolecular
condensates that control alternative splicing to centrally regulate cardiac development and disease. Our
specific aims are: (1) Identify the functional consequences of dysregulating the RBM20 splicing factory; (2)
Define the biophysical properties that drive assembly of the RBM20 splicing factory; (3) Define the key
components of the RBM20 splicing factory. In Aims 1 and 2, we will perform cellular experiments to clarify the
mechanisms and disease relevance of RBM20 focus formation, as well as functional studies using human
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Complementing hPSC-CM monolayer cultures, we
will characterize 3D engineered heart tissues (3D-EHTs) and human myocardial grafts. We will utilize
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to study the effect of RBM20 DCM mutations, as well as to generate fluorescent
reporter lines to study focus dynamics in physiologically relevant models. We will characterize disease-
associated changes in 3D chromatin topology within the RBM20 splicing factory using a combination of
established sequencing- and imaging-based methods. We will then synthesize these biophysical, topological,
and biochemical changes with functional genome-wide alterations in alternative splicing, to understand the
dysregulation of cardiac electrophysiological and contractile properties. Aiming to elucidate the disease
mechanism, we will probe the pathogenic role of specific RBM20-regulated splicing isoforms for CACNA1C and
CAMK2D. In Aim 3, we will apply a novel interaction-discovery method developed in the Shechner laboratory,
oligonucleotide-directed biotinylation (ODB), to perform an unbiased “multi-omic” analysis of the composition of
the splicing factory. We will then determine the role of the newly identified splicing targets in RBM20 DCM, and
of the putative RBM20 cofactors in the regulation of RBM20 puncta architecture and of cardiac genes' alternative
splicing. Collectively, these experiments will elucidate the mechanisms by which LLPS and subnuclear
architecture collaborate to drive alternative splicing in DCM, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets."

The overarching goals of this proposal are to contribute to the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and
potential strategies for prevention of the epidemic of chronic kidney disease of unknown
origin
(CKDu).
Our
central hypothesis is that exposure to high concentrations of airborne contaminants will be associated with kidney
injury, cellular stress, and systemic inflammation in females at-risk for CKDu in Guatemala and Nicaragua.
Nearly all research to date has focused on males, neglecting preliminary data showing that females working in
agriculture and living in agricultural communities in Central American countries are also affected by CKDu.
Additionally, studies to date have largely overlooked consideration of air pollutants as contributors to CKDu
etiology. Given
community
pathways
the potentially high exposures among Central American women from i n-home cooking sources,
 ambient air pollution, and agricultural sources, this is an ideal population to explore these potential
 linking exposure with kidney injury. In this proposal, we will characterize occupational and non-
occupational airborne exposures to particulate matter (PM), silica, and metals over repeat 8-hour monitoring
periods in 200 female sugarcane workers across three years (Aim 1). We will conduct 8-hour monitoring for each
participant at three time points, twice during the harvest, when exposure is highest, and once during the off-
season. We will evaluate the relationships between individual exposures (PM, silica, and metals) and risk factors
(heat stress and dehydration), mechanisms of injury (kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated
lipocalin, and uromodulin), heat-associated and cellular stress (heat shock protein 70), and inflammation (C-
reactive protein, white blood cells, and cytokines), and kidney biomarkers of effect (serum creatinine and cystatin
C) both acutely (Aim 2) and longitudinally (Aim 3). In addition, we will utilize novel statistical techniques, Bayesian
kernel machine regression (BKMR), weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and/or quantile g-computation, to
estimate the effects of airborne pollutant mixtures on kidney injury and inflammation (Sub Aim 2.1). The overall
goal of the study is to increase understanding of risk factors for CKDu in females to facilitate future research and
prevention strategies. The proposed research addresses a knowledge gap in understudied, highly exposed
populations: female workers in Guatemala and Nicaragua.
The individual, and combined, contributions of exposures and risk factors on biomarkers of kidney dysfunction,
cellular stress, and inflammation will be examined in this study. This

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is administered to treat locally advanced invasive breast cancer by shrink-
ing inoperable tumors, and to enable breast-conserving surgery. About 30% of patients have inadequate NACT
response, but are not immediately identified by standard imaging such as mammography, ultrasound, or struc-
tural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and are therefore subjected to unnecessary toxicity and thwarted from
customized treatment. An imaging method for early assessment of tumor response to NACT is still needed to
identify non-responders that may be candidates for alternative therapy. Our hypothesis is that, in responding pa-
tients, cancer cell damage induced by NACT can be characterized by loss of ion homeostasis through changes
in pH, membrane depolarization and dysregulation of transmembrane ion transporters. This loss of homeostasis
immediately manifests as variations in the intracellular sodium concentration and cellular volume fraction, and po-
tentially the cellular microenvironment itself. We therefore propose to implement a new quantitative multinuclear
MRI (QMM) protocol, where structural information from proton (1H) MR fingerprinting (MRF) acquired with both
CE (T1 pre/post contrast) and dynamic CE (pharmacokinetics) methods, and metabolic information from sodium
(23Na) MRF will be acquired simultaneously on a clinical system at 3 T. We will also develop a QMM-based
imaging biomarker model that combines the metabolic metrics related to ion homeostasis with the structural and
pharmacokinetic metrics to assess changes in cancer cell viability during early NACT as a predictor of therapy
response. Specific aim 1: Quantitative multinuclear MRI (QMM) protocol for breast imaging at 3 T. (1.a) To build a
1H/23Na multichannel RF coil for bilateral breast MRI at 3 T. (1.b) To optimize a multinuclear fingerprinting (MNF),
which consists of a simultaneous 1H/23Na MRF acquisition. MNF will be acquired with 2 echo times to separate
water and fat signals using the Dixon method (Dixon MNF), before and after Gadolinium contrast enhancement
(CE MNF), and also during dynamic CE (DCE MNF). (1.c) Optimization of the QMM protocol, which includes
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), CE MNF, DCE MNF, and Dixon MNF. Specific aim 2: Longitudinal application of
QMM in patients with breast cancer during NACT. (2) Longitudinal study in patients with triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) that undergo standard clinical NACT regimen, who will be scanned: (1) baseline (pre-NACT),
(2) within 1 week of the 1st cycle, (3) within 1 week of the 2nd cycle. Specific aim 3: To develop biomarker
model for prognosis of therapy efficiency from QMM data. (3.a) To develop an imaging biomarker model of breast
cancer response to therapy based on the combination of metabolic, pharmacokinetic, and structural metrics from
the QMM protocol. (3.b) To determine which combinations of biomarkers from the model are best predictor of

10757719,"The overall goal of our research is to determine the structures, modification sites, biosynthesis, and functions
of sugars (O-glycans) linked to two cysteine-rich domains: Epidermal Growth Factor-like Repeats (EGFs) and
Thrombospondin Type 1 Repeats (TSRs). Both EGFs and TSRs are found in numerous cell-surface and
extracellular proteins. We focus on two modifications on EGFs, O-fucose (added by Protein O-
fucosyltransferase 1, POFUT1) and O-glucose (added by Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1, POGLUT1). We
also study O-fucose (added by POFUT2) on TSRs. All three enzymes modify hydroxyl groups of specific
serines or threonines in well characterized consensus sequences within EGFs or TSRs. Knockouts of these
enzymes are embryonic lethal in mice, and mutations in POFUT1 or POGLUT1 cause human genetic
disorders, demonstrating the biological importance of these modifications. We propose to address several
unanswered questions about the proteins modified by these O-glycans. For instance, we want to determine
the O-fucose proteome. To understand O-fucose function, we need to know which proteins are modified.
While database searches with the consensus sequences for POFUT1 and POFUT2 have successfully
identified many target proteins, recent data has revealed a different cysteine-rich domain modified with O-
fucose, an EMI domain in Multimerin1, which was not identified in our searches. Here we describe an unbiased
approach to identify O-fucosylated proteins using a bioorthogonal probe, 6-alkynyl fucose (6AF), that is
efficiently and preferentially incorporated into O-fucosylated proteins in cells. We expect to confirm a number of
predicted substrates for POFUT1 and POFUT2, which will provide novel targets to study, but also to identify
proteins that did not appear in database searches. We also want to examine the structure and function of
O-fucose and O-glucose modifications on NOTCH3. In the past few years we have mapped O-fucose
glycans to sites on NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 using glycoproteomic methods and determined which sites play
biologically important roles. NOTCH3 is known to play important roles in vascular homeostasis, and mutations
in NOTCH3 cause CADASIL, a devastating, autosomal dominant vascular disorder. The molecular
mechanisms resulting in CADASIL are poorly understood. CADASIL mutations add or remove cysteines in
NOTCH3 EGFs, which are predicted to disrupt glycosylation. We will map glycosylation sites on NOTCH3
isolated from vascular smooth muscle cells and evaluate how CADASIL mutations affect its glycosylation
status. Finally, POFUT1 and POFUT2 are both soluble enzymes located in the lumen of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), but their donor substrate, GDP-fucose, is synthesized in the cytosol. It is not known how
GDP-fucose is transported into the ER. Here we describe a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify the putative ER
GDP-fucose transporter. These studies will extend our understanding of the structure and function of O-
glycans on cysteine-rich domains and their potential roles in diseases."
10872122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed
airflow from the lungs. As a common complex disease, COPD has high global morbidity and mortality. Indeed,
deaths due to respiratory disease numbered nearly four million, which was mostly contributed by COPD. There
is a clear demand to improve our understanding of COPD pathogenesis and develop interventions to prevent
and treat COPD. Yet, a complex disease phenotype is usually determined by various pathobiological processes
that interact in a network, rather than induced by the abnormality in a single effector gene product. Extensive
evidence implies that disease-associated proteins have distinct interactions within the human protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network (a.k.a. the human interactome), and the pathobiological processes of a complex
disease are associated with perturbation within specific disease neighborhoods of the interactome, often referred
to as the disease module. Comprehensive understanding of the COPD pathogenesis and predicting disease
genes to inform therapeutic treatment require advanced tools to identify its disease module. Although many
disease module detection methods have been reported in the literature, they all have fundamental limitations.
More importantly, existing methods do not fully leverage the advantage of multi-omics data. In this application,
a statistical physics and network-based framework will be developed to detect disease modules for complex
human diseases using multi-omics data. This framework will be systematically validated with synthetic data.
Then it will be applied to the rich multi-omics data (SNP genotyping, DNA methylation, mRNA and miRNA
expression) in two large COPD cohorts. Dr. Wang’s training in statistical physics, network science and deep
learning have prepared him well for his proposed research. However, understanding and interpreting the
molecular basis of complex diseases and the statistical analysis of multi-omics data are still arduous tasks that
will require further training in specific areas. Dr. Wang will leverage the excellent intellectual environment of
Harvard Medical School and its teaching hospitals and will have access to extensive computational resources
through the Channing Division of Network Medicine and Harvard Medical School. Through the guidance of a
mentoring and advisory team with complementary expertise, together with formal coursework and workshops,
Dr. Wang will immerse himself in a training program focusing on statistical genetics, epigenetics, multi-omics
integration, and the biology of pulmonary diseases. Dr. Wang will also participate in regular meetings with his
mentors and advisory committee members, allowing him to share his progress and receive timely feedback.
Altogether, Dr. Wang’s training and research plan will enable him to expand his current skillset to include the
ability to address the challenges of analyzing the complex genomic and epigenomic data of large epidemiological
cohorts, identify open questions in the systems biology of COPD, and ultimately contribute to the precision
medicine of lung diseases."

This R21 application for the NOSI: Bold New Bioengineering Research for Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep
Disorders and Diseases details the technical development of a unique method to maintain whole human lungs
for an extended period in order to revolutionize solid organ transplantation and human translational research.
Normothermic ex situ, or ex vivo, organ perfusion (EVOP) is a clinically accepted method of preserving,
evaluating, and rehabilitating whole organs for transplantation. EVOP has also been utilized by scientists for
translational research and emerged as an important platform to study organs with fully intact cell-cell interactions,
endothelial and epithelial interfaces, and with the entire spectrum of cellular compartments seen in vivo.
Therefore, EVOP provides a unique platform to preserve organs for transplantation, as well as to study human
physiology and pathology through preclinical translational studies. Unfortunately, EVOP is currently severely
limited due to the short time frame of organ health stability currently provided by the technology. Therefore,
there is an unmet need in EVOP strategies that requires new technology. The investigative team has the
needed experience in organ transplantation, pulmonary physiology, biomedical engineering and vascular biology
in order to ensure success of the proposed work. Aim 1 will leverage the expertise of the investigators with a
porcine model of lung EVOP to extended stable organ preservation to at least 5 days through several key
technology advances, including metabolic substrate support, waste product removal, dual perfusion, and the use
of cellular enriched perfusate. Porcine lungs were utilized extensively for the initial development of lung EVOP
and provide a high-fidelity model for translational work. In Year 2, Aim 2 will leverage and validate lessons
learned during Aim 1 using human lungs from consented organ donors. The overall objective of this proposal
is to obviate the current limitation of time for lung EVOP by adapting existing ex vivo lung perfusion
strategies to allow for perpetual organ preservation and rehabilitation, or POPR. POPR would radically
change allocation and availability of organs, allow time for interventions that could rehabilitate otherwise
unusable organs, improve organs via immunomodulation or microbiologic clearance, and potentially mitigate
other factors that limit the use of potential organ donors. Therefore, the development of POPR would be of
tremendous public health importance and our proposal leverages the transdisciplinary expertise of lung
transplantation, organ preservation, vascular endothelial health and biomedical engineering specialists. The
technology proposed herein, once developed, could be used by transplant programs clinically and by
researchers in specialized centers across the country. Importantly, principals developed herein can be applied
to other solid organs, including heart, kidney, and small bowel, to extend solid organ transplantation and
research."

Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in the USA and the need for effective therapies is
dire. KRAS is mutationally activated in ~95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the major pancreatic
cancer subtype. Cell culture and mouse model analyses provide strong validation for the role of mutant KRAS
in the maintenance of PDAC, and the NCI has identified development of KRAS-targeted therapies as one of four
major priorities for the field. Sotorasib was recently FDA-approved as the first direct KRAS inhibitor for use in
KRASG12C-mutant lung cancer. However, the clinical utility of sotorasib and all other clinical candidates in PDAC
is limited for two main reasons. First, sotorasib targets KRASG12C, a mutation that represents less than 2% of
KRAS mutations in PDAC. KRAS inhibitors that target other KRAS mutations are currently under preclinical
development. Second, patients initially responsive to KRASG12C inhibitors all soon relapse. Early studies have
begun to identify genetic events that drive resistance, with expected components of RAS signaling identified in
patients. However, no clear mechanisms have been identified in about half of relapsed patients. A full delineation
of these mechanisms will be needed to develop effective combinations that can prolong patient response to
KRAS-targeted therapies. This proposal builds on the emerging concept in understanding KRAS driver
mechanisms, that different mutations cause distinct consequences on KRAS function. Consequently, there are
mutation-specific driver functions that can be exploited to develop mutation-selective combination therapies.
These studies focus on two lesser-studied, atypical KRAS mutations in PDAC – KRASG12R, which is unexpectedly
enriched, and KRASQ61H, which is unexpectedly rare. The proposed studies will utilize direct pharmacologic
inhibitors of KRASG12R and KRASQ61H in PDAC. System-wide unbiased genetic loss-of-function CRISPR/Cas9
oncogenic signaling pathway libraries will be used to identify therapeutic resistance mechanisms to KRAS
inhibition. Preliminary data strongly implicate both known and novel resistance mechanisms. Finally, because
KRASG12R and KRASQ61H-mutant pancreatic cancers exhibit distinct functional differences, these studies will
likely identify both common and distinct resistance mechanisms to KRAS inhibition, which will lead to distinct
KRAS inhibitor combination approaches. This proposal also describes the development of KrasG12R and KrasQ61H
syngeneic, orthotopic pancreatic cancer mouse models. These new models will be used to define mutation-
specific cancer functions, and to enable assessment of the influence of the tumor microenvironment on the
consequences of KRAS inhibition alone and in combination. The overarching goals of this proposal are to further
elucidate how two atypical KRAS mutations drive PDAC growth and to inform identification of combinations that
can increase the clinical effectiveness of mutation-specific anti-KRAS strategies in PDAC."

Gene therapy (GT) clinical trials using AAV vectors are poised to fulfill the promise of a safe, affordable, lifelong
correction of bleeding disorders following a single treatment. Still, clinical trials using AAV vectors to treat
hemophilia A (HA) in adults have underscored the hurdles, such as the presence of pre-existing AAV antibodies,
and unexpected risk of hepatoxicity in these patients. Importantly, this toxicity was not seen in preclinical animal
studies, highlighting the dangers of extrapolating data from animal models to humans. Since the next step for
GT to treat severe HA will be implementation of this approach in children, it is crucial to predict, as accurately as
possible, unforeseen risks in this population. Currently, is unknown whether the unexpected immune/
inflammatory responses seen are due to the use of AAV as a delivery vehicle, or they are caused by the forced
expression of FVIII within hepatocytes, which are not the native site of FVIII production. However, since similar
toxicity has not been seen in AAV clinical trials for hemophilia B (hepatocytes are the natural site of FIX
production), it is rational to posit that ectopic FVIII expression likely plays a role. In addition, preclinical data have
also shown that, at the high doses used, AAV, long assumed to be largely episomal, may exhibit significant
levels of host genome integration that could potentially drive clonal expansion and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), the risk of which increases as a result of hepatocyte proliferation. These are critical questions to safely
extend the use of these potentially curative treatments to the pediatric population, in whom the higher proliferation
and more primitive state of the liver may increase these risks. The overall goal of the present proposal is to
utilize a human liver tissue equivalent (hLTE) platform to answer these questions and to determine the impact
recipient age has on these variables. We will use hLTE to test the overall hypothesis that FVIII expression can
be improved, the pre-existing immunity to AAV overcome, and the toxicity seen in clinical trials avoided, by
optimizing the codon usage and/or sequence of the fVIII transgene to minimize the unfolded protein response
and ER stress and/or by targeting transduction to hepatic endothelium, the native site of FVIII synthesis.
Specifically, we will use a physiologically relevant hLTE platform to: 1) define age-dependent impact of AAV
transduction vs. hepatocyte-targeted FVIII expression on human liver biology and function, the potential to trigger
innate immunity, and whether optimizing the codon usage and sequence content of the fVIII transgene can
prevent this undesired immune/inflammatory response; 2) test whether targeting AAV transduction to hepatic
endothelium will improve FVIII expression, prevent hepatic inflammation/immunity, preserve liver function, and
protect AAV from existing anti-capsid immunity; and 3) investigate if genomic integration frequency will be higher
at younger ages, due to increased cell cycling, and whether targeting hepatic endothelial cells will decrease the
potential for genotoxicity. It is hoped that these studies will identify the means to maximize the efficacy and safety
of human liver-targeted AAV GT for HA and thereby pave the way for its use in pediatric patients."

This proposal describes a five-year mentored laboratory training experience designed to lead to an independent
academic research career dissecting the underlying biology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The applicant’s career
goal is to become a prominent scientist in the AD research filed by leading an independently funded research
group. The career development plan includes training designed to broaden the applicant’s scientific skillset by:
(1) employing translational approaches to identify and characterize key proteins of an AD-associated network to
determine how they contribute to AD pathogenesis, (2) utilizing systems biology approaches to dissect network
behavior when key interconnected proteins are perturbed and (3) using cross-species approaches to identify
additional proteins linked to specific AD pathological triggers as therapeutic targets in the fight against AD. This
plan incorporates additional training in leadership, mentorship, grant-writing, and ethics. During the period of
mentored research training, the applicant will engage in skills acquisition, didactic training, seminars,
international conferences, and meetings with his mentor and mentorship committee, followed by a transition to
independence. The proposed research aims to improve our understanding of the biology underlying AD
progression through investigation of an AD-associated protein network. We have identified the human M42
network that is strongly correlated with pathology and declining cognition in AD. Based on network analyses,
SPARC Related Modular Calcium Binding-1 (SMOC1) was identified as a potential network driver that best
represents the behavior of the entire network. The overall project goal is to validate and elucidate the role of
M42 by dissecting SMOC1 function in the Drosophila model. My cross-species approach will powerfully enhance
our understanding of SMOC1 in the adult brain, which is predicted to modulate both TGFβ and wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathways, and identify additional M42 proteins important in AD pathology, thus informing a therapeutic
rationale for further studies in mammalian preclinical AD models. This five year project will take place primarily
at Baylor College of Medicine, an institution with nationally recognized research programs in genetics,
neuroscience and AD. The Department of Neurology has an outstanding track record of training early stage
investigators to become successful translational researchers. The research environment provides the best
intellectual environment, cutting edge technologies and state-of-the art facilities. The proposal provides a broad
research experience in systems biology analysis of proteomic data, cross-species validation of a translationally
relevant protein network, along with functional characterization of its proposed driver protein SMOC1, a novel
biomarker and potential therapeutic target in AD. Completion of this proposal and its associated training plan
will prepare this applicant to become an independent scientist and leader in the AD research field."

Malaria, caused by infection with Plasmodium spp., is one of the oldest and most lethal diseases in human
history. It continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, especially amongst children under five.
Despite over a decade of progress in reducing the burden of malaria, the last four years have seen a
stagnation due to recalcitrance in highly endemic areas and interruptions in eradication efforts. As for any
infectious disease, sustained progress will require an effective vaccine. For malaria, antibodies have been
shown particularly potent in stopping the “sporozoite” form of Plasmodium during its ~30 minute journey from
the mosquito, into the skin and then into a liver hepatocyte. Here, the parasite completes the asymptomatic
“pre-erythrocytic” (PE) stages over ~1 week before emerging back into the blood for the erythrocytic stage,
where it infects red blood cells and causes all morbidity, mortality and transmission. Stopping the parasite at
the PE stage (i.e. sterile protection) is the ultimate goal of a malaria vaccine. Unfortunately, antibody-based
vaccine candidates targeting the major surface protein (circumsporozoite protein, CSP) exposed at the
sporozoite surface have failed to provide the long-lasting sterile protection needed for sustained control and
elimination as this requires extremely high titers of antibodies which can only be maintained over short periods
or with frequent boosting. One strategy to enhance CSP-based vaccines is to target additional antigens.
However, demonstration that non-CSP targeting antibodies which can function on their own or in concert with
CSP has been lacking. Current efforts have focused on surface/secreted proteins exposed during the
extracellular sporozoite stage in line with dogma that once the parasite is within the hepatocyte, it is no longer
accessible to antibodies. Surprisingly, we have found that antibodies targeting a liver stage-specific
protein, UIS3, can efficiently kill the parasite during the intracellular hepatocyte stage. Furthermore, a
low dose of these antibodies can synergize with a low dose of anti-CSP antibodies to raise sterile
protection from 0% with each antibody alone to 64% in combination. These data not only add to the
small number of bona fide PE antibody targets, but also open an entirely new parasite stage for
antibody discovery and are the first demonstration of synergy between multiple antigens at the PE
stage. While such intracellularly targeted antibodies (iAbs) have been described for other pathogens, their
mechanisms of action are not well understood. Here, we aim to use monoclonal antibodies to define the basic
functional characteristics of anti-UIS3 antibodies and to identify the core mechanisms of anti-UIS3 iAb action.
These data will support the rational design of superior CSP-based vaccines and monoclonal antibody regimens
with an iAb component, with the goal that these Ab-based interventions can achieve the high levels of long-
lasting sterile protection to drive malaria to elimination."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of common and rare genetic variants
associated with complex traits and common diseases. Most variants map to the 98% of the genome that is
noncoding, with their target genes or function largely unknown. This is the variant-to-function problem (V2F), and
solving it remains a major hurdle in human genetics research. To help solve V2F, I propose to develop modular
workflows combining GWAS variant prioritization methods and pooled single-cell CRISPR screens for target
gene identification. I have developed an integrative approach combining highly polygenic blood trait GWASs and
pooled single-cell CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screens in a human erythroid progenitor cell model (K562), to
identify target genes: Systematic Targeting and Inhibition of Noncoding GWAS loci with single-cell sequencing
(STING-seq). STING-seq can functionally dissect multiple GWAS loci in a massively parallel fashion, identifying
target genes in cis as well as trans-regulatory networks. Here, I will develop STING-seq further and examine its
generalizability for other GWAS traits and their cell models. First, I will expand STING-seq with precise variant
insertion, developing base editing STING-seq (Bee-STING) for high-throughput measurements of GWAS variant
effects on target genes and regulatory networks. Second, I will develop modular workflows for GWAS variant
prioritization for STING-seq, targeting sets of variants with distinct selection criteria to increase STING-seq’s
target gene and regulatory network discovery rate. Third, I will focus STING-seq on new GWAS traits and cell
models to examine its generalizability, first piloting STING-seq for another highly polygenic complex trait, bone
mineral density, with a human osteoblast cell model (hFOB). In the long-term, these aims will help solve V2F for
human genetics research, as their continued development and application will improve our understanding of how
GWAS variants causally influence complex traits and common diseases. I have a comprehensive training plan
in place with my primary mentors, Dr. Neville Sanjana (genome engineering) and Dr. Tuuli Lappalainen (gene
regulation), my mentorship committee members, Dr. David Knowles (machine learning), Dr. Aravinda
Chakravarti (human genetics), Dr. Charles Farber (bone biology), and my collaborator Dr. Eugene Katsevich
(statistical methods). This plan will continue my training in dissecting GWAS variant function with multiple
computational and experimental approaches, along with additional training in grant writing, mentoring students,
teaching courses, and presenting at research conferences. The full mentorship committee will direct me to
pertinent literature, offer advice on my research program, and provide guidance as I navigate the academic job
market. The New York Genome Center is the ideal training location for me, given its cutting-edge facilities,
plentiful opportunities for career and intellectual development, and collaborative research environment. Upon
completion of this training program, I will be well-positioned to lead my own interdisciplinary research lab and
become a leader in the fields of human complex traits genetics and genome engineering."

CAR-T cell therapy is an emerging option for cancer treatment, but its efficacy is limited, especially in solid tumors
because the effector CD8+T cells become dysfunctional and exhausted in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
However, the key pathways that define the delicate balance between the effector vs exhausted state of CD8+T
cells remain unclear.
Our preliminary studies demonstrate that sumoylation of the T-box transcription factor, Eomesodermin (Eomes),
facilitates its association with Zbtb44, a member of the ThPOK family of transcription factors. The Zbtb44-Eomes
complex promotes the effector function and anti-tumor activity of CD8+ tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs). In
exhausted CD8+ TILs, the ubiquitin ligase Trim47 targets Zbtb44 for degradation and disrupts the Zbtb44-Eomes
complex. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inhibition of Trim47 rescues exhausted CD8+ TILs and restores
their effector function. These preliminary findings led us to hypothesize that ubiquitination and sumoylation of
the Zbtb44/Eomes complex are critical molecular events that dictate the effector vs exhaustion of CD8+ TILs
which can be therapeutically targeted.
In Aim1, we will determine the mechanism by which the Zbtb44-Eomes complex promotes effector CD8+T cell
function and anti-tumor immunity. We will use newly generated Zbtb44-/- mice to investigate how sumoylation of
Eomes at Lys(K)-446 facilitates the formation of the Zbtb44-Eomes complex via the SUMO interacting motif
(SIM) within Zbtb44. Further, we will delineate the mechanism by which the Zbtb44-Eomes complex
cooperatively binds to and transactivates the IFN- promoter. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by
which Trim47-mediated ubiquitination of Zbtb44 leads to dysfunction of CD8+T cells. We will investigate how
Trim47, which is upregulated in exhausted (PD1+Tim3+) CD8+ TILs, targets Zbtb44 for ubiquitination at K139 and
promotes its degradation. Using newly generated Trim47-/- mice, we will determine how disruption of the Zbtb44-
Eomes complex leads to the inhibitory transcriptional profile of exhausted CD8+T cells. In Aim 3, we will target
the Zbtb44-Trim47 pathway to promote anti-tumor immunity. We will test the therapeutic potential of blocking
Zbtb44 ubiquitination in CAR-T cells against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the MC38 and in a patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) colon cancer model.
Completion of these studies will lead to: 1) dissection of the novel Zbtb44-Eomes complex that is critical for
effector CD8+ T cell function, 2) determination of how Trim47-mediated ubiquitination disrupts this complex
leading to alternate transcription profile in exhausted CD8+ TILs, and 3) evaluate the means to target the Zbtb44-
Trim47 pathway to overcome the current limitations of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors."

Ovarian cancer is a diverse group of malignancies that can vary greatly in molecular biology, etiology, and
presentation of symptoms. While it accounts for 2.5% of all cancers among women, it results in roughly 5%
of cancer-related deaths due to its high fatality rate. This is because 75% of patients are diagnosed with
advanced disease, largely attributed to its relatively late presentation of symptoms and a lack of reliable
detection and monitoring strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells, including ovarian
cancer, and their cargo reflects their cells of origin. They have shown immense potential as stable
biomarkers, however their low abundance compared to EVs from healthy cells and a lack of sufficiently
sensitive characterization tools has limited their clinical translation. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) is sensitive enough to biochemically fingerprint even single EVs, and the information-rich spectra
produced in EV SERS can be fed into machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify them based on their
latent spectral features. Despite early progress in EV SERS, the highly heterogeneous nature of EVs
indicates that their separation into distinct subpopulations prior to SERS analysis may help improve disease
diagnosis, classification, and monitoring. Microfluidic devices are uniquely capable of separating EV s into
subpopulations of interest while simultaneously enabling SERS spectral acquisition in a single device. In the
proposed research, during the mentored phase, ML-enabled inverse design will be combined with high
resolution nanofabrication techniques to improve the signal strength and spectral quality attainable from EV
SERS. Preliminary data indicates that the SERS enhancement is highly dependent on the substrate’s
nanoscale geometry, which is particularly important for EVs compared to conventional chemical analysis.
Towards the end of the mentored phase, once the improved substrates have been thoroughly tested using
bioreactor-produced EVs, they will be incorporated into two distinct microfluidic devices and tested
throughout the independent phase using both cell culture and patient EV samples. One device will capture
different subpopulations of EVs directly onto the microfluidic SERS substrates based on specific surface-
antigens for multiplexed characterization, while the other will separate EVs precisely by size and flow them
over the microfluidic SERS substrates to produce EV SERS barcodes. In parallel, ML algorithms tailored
specifically to these platforms will also be developed to process and classify the acquired spectra. This
proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing advanced ML and micro-nanofabrication techniques as well as EV
production, isolation, and characterization strategies. These experiments are innovative and significant
because they will develop ML inverse design architectures specifically for EVs as well as microfluidic EV
SERS for characterizing and classifying ovarian cancer."
10928695,"Project Summary Abstract
Buprenorphine reduces overdose mortality by up to 70%, making it one of the most critical interventions to
combat the opioid overdose crisis. With the increasing prevalence of illicit fentanyl, patients with opioid use
disorder (OUD) attempting to initiate buprenorphine now routinely report experiencing precipitated withdrawal
despite waiting for withdrawal symptoms to first emerge. In response, clinicians and patients alike are
increasingly recommending a novel strategy called “micro-dosing” or “low-dose” buprenorphine induction, where
a dose significantly lower than the typical 4mg is administered. With this strategy, precipitated withdrawal does
not occur despite buprenorphine is administered before the emergence of withdrawal symptoms. A variety of
low-dose induction protocols have been reported—some use low dose (≤0.5mg) SL buprenorphine, while others
initially use transdermal (Butrans®) or buccal (Belbulca®) formulations. Regardless of the specific approach, the
requirements for a successful low-dose induction appear to be the low initial dose, the slow up-titration of the
buprenorphine, and continuation of the full agonist opioid during the induction. However, these approaches can
be problematic—low-dose SL buprenorphine requires the medication to be cut which is often prohibited in
inpatient settings; transdermal and buccal formulations are costly and often not on formulary; and their use
violates US federal laws that prohibit them to be prescribed to outpatients seeking treatment for OUD. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to research strategies for buprenorphine low-dose inductions that avoid having to cut the
medication, or use prohibited and costly formulations. To meet this need, we propose to study the safety and
feasibility of utilizing orally (PO) administered buprenorphine. Buprenorphine undergoes extensive first-pass
effect when taken PO, hence the bioavailability is estimated to be significantly less than the SL route of 30-50%.
As such, using the existing SL dose formulations (e.g. 8mg) via the oral route may allow low-dose induction
without having to split the medication. However, research on the safety and feasibility of PO buprenorphine is
largely absent. We therefore propose to conduct a two-phased study: in the first phase, we will conduct a
randomized cross-over trial with healthy human volunteers to receive low-dose SL and PO buprenorphine to
determine the pharmacokinetic parameters. The results will inform the dose needed for a successful low-dose
induction using PO buprenorphine. In the second phase, we will conduct a pilot feasibility trial among individuals
with OUD to undergo a low-dose induction using PO buprenorphine in a controlled laboratory setting. Given the
importance of buprenorphine in improving clinical outcomes for individuals with OUD and preventing overdose
deaths, research that aims to identify safe approaches to treatment initiation are urgently needed. Results from
this study will be the basis for a safe, accessible, and evidence-based approach to buprenorphine initiation, and
lay the groundwork for a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of low-dose induction strategies using
PO buprenorphine with standard inductions."
10840258,"Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a prevalent clinical problem, with many knowledge gaps in the
pathogenesis of ALD, including the role and regulation of inflammatory and tissue reactions. Our overarching
goal is to identify key new players in alcohol-mediated effects on development and progression of liver
damage and fibrosis that could translate to targeted therapies. The extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM
dyshomeostasis are known to be important in ALD. ECM is produced by resident cells in the tissue/organ and
contains a diverse range of components that create a dynamic and responsive microenvironment that regulates
cell and tissue homeostasis. Our previous work demonstrated diverse qualitative and quantitative alterations to
hepatic ECM during experimental ALD. In toto, alterations to the hepatic ECM are mediated not only by changes
in ECM production, but also by changes in ECM degradation. We and others have demonstrated that even acute
liver injury causes robust hepatic ECM changes. ECM also represents a potent reservoir of cell-signaling
molecules that regulate cell behavior, determine cell phenotype and cell secretome, as well as influence
inflammatory tissue responses. Numerous examples exist of cells dramatically changing their structural and
functional phenotype when exposed to ECM different from their existing (normal or abnormal) ECM. By
extension, changes to and/or altered turnover of hepatic ECM have potential to drive phenotypic changes in
disease pathogenesis and progression. Work from our group shows that a major source of signaling molecules
in ECM resides within matrix bound nanovesicles (MBV). MBV are nanometer-sized, membranous vesicles
uniquely-bound within the ECM network. MBV contain and protect biologically active signaling molecules
(miRNAs/proteins), and are known to play a role in immunomodulation, stem/progenitor cell differentiation, and
maintenance of structurally normal and functional tissues. MBV likely play a fundamental role in tissue and organ
organization across species and a regulatory role in the tissue response to injury. Our exciting preliminary studies
show alcohol exposure dramatically alters hepatic MBV proteome and RNA/miRNA content. Similar changes are
also seen in liver MBV isolated from ALD human explant livers vs liver MBV from non-ALD patients. We also
show that liver MBV from alcohol-fed mice have differential effects on macrophage polarization and activation.
Most importantly our preliminary findings suggest exogenous administration of MBV can significantly reduce
alcohol-associated liver damage and inflammation. We hypothesize that MBV act not only as tissue
biomarkers of ALD but are also important in regulating pathogenesis and disease progression. We will
test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1. To analyze liver MBV biology in ALD.; 2. To understand
mechanisms of liver MBV effects in ALD; 3. To test the ability of MBV to treat experimental ALD. Impact:
Successful completion of the proposed work will identify unique MBV disease footprint and mechanisms of
effects in liver and assess potential for therapeutic use of MBV in ALD."

 Orofacial clefts (OFCs, comprising cleft lip-CL, cleft palate-CP, or both-CLP) are the most common
craniofacial anomalies in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 700 newborns worldwide, and are thus one of
the most common structural birth defects. There are substantial public health impacts of OFCs, due to
associated morbidity and mortality. An average child with an OFC initially faces feeding difficulties, undergoes
6 surgeries, spends 30 days in hospital, receives 5 years of orthodontic treatment, and participates in ongoing
speech therapy, leading to an estimated total lifetime treatment cost of about $200,000. Further, individuals
born with an OFC have an increased incidence of mental health problems, higher mortality rates at all stages
of life and higher risk for other disorders (notably including breast, brain, and colon cancers), and higher infant
mortality (particularly in developing countries where access to medical care may be limited). OFCs are
etiologically complex, resulting from genetic variants, environmental exposures, and their interactions. Genome
wide association studies coupled with sequencing results have identified at least 35 genes/regions achieving
genome-wide significance from multiple independent studies but these results only account for a fraction of
heritability. Rare variant studies are emerging with the availability of whole genome sequencing (WGS)
datasets, but functional validation of rare variants is essential to generate the support necessary to link these
genes/variants to OFCs, to understand the biology behind OFCs, to translate association signals into accurate
risk predictions, and ultimately to develop and/or improve therapies. The overall goal of this new
collaborative project is to identify the functional significance of rare risk variants identified in our large
resource of OFC families and controls. The proposed aims of this new project will help achieve our overall
goal. We will utilize our OFC WGS resources (2,078 OFC case/parent trios) to discover new genomic risk
variants with innovative analyses emphasizing single nucleotide variants (SNVs), structural variants (SVs), and
indels. For functional validation, this new project will take advantage of the high-efficiency and flexibility of
CRISPR/Cas9 technology: research team members at the Jackson Laboratory have developed a novel
approach to rapidly validate putative causative variants in the mouse, thus enabling the use of a mammalian
system for both variant validation and for more detailed investigation of the resulting cleft phenotypes."
10812311,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Approximately 50 million people suffer from one or more autoimmune diseases in the US alone. Over the
last decades, the discovery of biologics has considerably improved the care for patients with autoimmune
diseases. However, current treatments require weekly or more frequent injections and this can lead to missed
doses and to poor patient compliance, especially in the younger population, resulting is inconsistent or sub-
therapeutic drug levels. Since many of the therapeutics on the market or being developed to treat rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis, and other T lymphocyte-mediated chronic autoimmune diseases are biologics,
we propose a novel bioengineering approach for the non-invasive delivery of recombinant peptides in
autoimmune diseases. More specifically, we propose to produce an immunomodulatory peptide by a probiotic
for oral administration to treat RA.
 As our immunomodulator, we have chosen a recombinant analog of ShK, a small venom peptide that blocks
Kv1.3 channels and thus inhibits the activation of human and rat effector memory T lymphocytes. As a probiotic,
we have selected Lactobacillus reuteri LJ01, a well-characterized probiotic that survives transit through the
gastrointestinal tract. In preliminary work, we have introduced an ShK analog in L. reuteri to generate LrS235
that secretes a functionally active peptide upon induction, resulting in the block of Kv1.3 channels and the
inhibition of human TEM cell proliferation in vitro and in a reduction of clinical severity in a small pilot trial using

Through this project, we will define the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and efficacy of ShK-235 produced by
LrS235 in preventing and treating rat models of RA (Specific Aim 1) and we will define and optimize the
efficacy and safety of our probiotic based gut delivery (Specific Aim 2). At the end of this project, we will have
established proof-of-concept for a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of RA and other autoimmune

In order to improve cancer patient outcomes, the next generation of cancer therapeutics should combine
targeted treatments with the ability to predict the likelihood of an individual’s tumor to benefit from a given
treatment. The focus of this project is on advancing a personalized platform based on the individual’s tumor
behavior which is determined not only by the cancerous epithelium but the entire tumor microenvironment
(TME). The role of TME in disease progression or even therapeutic drug response is well established in variety
of cancers with poor outcome including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) with a five year survival rate
of less than 10%. Here, combining 3D patient-derived organoids (PDO) and microfluidic technologies, we will
develop a novel tumor-chip device with the potential to generate individualized treatment response predictions
ex vivo. In Aim 1, using multiple tissue and functional read outs we will show that our multicellular platform
recapitulates the tumor and its microenvironment. In Aim 2, we will show the utility of our system as an
individualized ex vivo platform to functionally characterize the tumor response to conventional and novel
therapies. Our long-term goal is to optimize patient-specific ex vivo drug response assay technology such that
it may be used to rapidly, accurately, and reliably inform individualized treatment decisions. As a proof of
concept, the project involves developing a personalized pancreatic cancer model; however this technology can
be extended to other solid tumor types with rich TME (i.e., breast cancer) to improve molecular and/or cellular
characterizations of cancer biology and therapeutics."

In the progression from middle to older-age, healthy adults typically experience improvements in their emotional
functioning, such as increases in positive emotion and greater expertise in managing emotions. However, not
everyone shows these age-related improvements, and the mechanisms that give rise to emotional functioning
changes across adulthood are still poorly understood. The primary goal of this project is to examine the critical
factors that promote positive emotional development in normative aging, and to test whether depression history
might moderate this process as a key trait individual difference marker. To this end, we test our proposed Value-
Based Cognitive Control Model of Emotion Regulation in ADulthood (VBCC-MERiAD). The VBCC-MERiAD
framework suggests a novel insight: that interactions between reward motivation and cognitive control play a
central role in understanding both the normative trajectory of emotional functioning in older adults, and
conversely, why and how individuals with depression histories may get “off track”. We focus on effectively
upregulating positive emotion, given that older adults prioritize positive emotion goals, and because depression
is characterized by blunted reward processing. Our primary hypothesis is that positive emotion regulation (ER)
abilities will rely upon the integrity of fronto-striatal circuitry (i.e., activity and connectivity between the lateral
prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens / ventral striatum). Engagement of this circuit is predicted to reflect the
utilization of reward motivation as a means of engaging cognitive control (i.e., to update and maintain ER goals).
Across three Specific Aims, we propose to characterize the mechanisms of ER in middle-aged and older adults
(35-74), focusing on neural and behavioral indicators of motivation and cognitive control that predict daily
emotional functioning, and potential dysregulation in individuals with depression history. To achieve these aims,
we will employ a multi-method design involving functional neuroimaging measures, laboratory behavioral
assessments, and experience sampling methods. The sample (N=220) will include an ethnically/racially diverse
set of adults (66% women) of ages 35-74, equally subdivided into two groups: healthy controls and people with
depression histories. A state-of-the art neuroimaging protocol will assess brain activity associated with different
ER strategies, and test for linkages with reward-motivated cognitive control. The comprehensive laboratory
assessments will include diagnostic interviewing, self-report measures, cognitive functioning batteries, and a
standardized ER task with measures of autonomic reactivity and behavioral coding of emotion. The experience
sampling protocol will provide a naturalistic, ecologically valid assessment of participants’ emotional
experiences, goals and regulatory strategies. The proposed research will dramatically extend our understanding
of both normative and dysfunctional age-related change in emotional function, by identifying mechanisms that
promote positive ER in late adulthood. In so doing, we will lay the foundation for new interventions to improve
quality of life for healthy older adults and preventative therapeutic targets for individuals with depression history."

This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K01). The goal of
the proposed project is to provide the candidate with advanced skills necessary to develop an independent
research program focused on the association between physical activity and cognitive decline and dementia,
particularly as it pertains to Alzheimer disease-related dementias (ADRDs). To facilitate this long-term career
goal the candidate will: focus on two physical activity-related measures of energy expenditure (“energetics”) (1)
cardiorespiratory fitness and (2) the energetic cost of walking, as objective markers of the physiological
consequences of habitual physical activity. Recent published work by the candidate suggests that measures of
energetics may optimally capture the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical
activity on risk for cognitive decline. This research indicates that lower levels of cardiorespiratory fitness –the
integrated ability to deliver oxygen to the musculoskeletal system during sustained activity– is associated with
cognitive decline, increased rate of brain atrophy, and decreased resting cerebral blood flow and that a higher
energetic cost of walking –the oxygen needed for customary paced walking– is associated with increased odds
of amyloid positivity and accelerated hippocampal and brain atrophy. This application proposes a longitudinal
study to i) investigate the extent to which changes in energetics track with changes in cognition and AD
biomarkers, ii) assess which modifiable energetic measure may hold the greatest predictive value with respect
to the forgoing outcomes; and iii) investigate mitochondrial function as a potential underlying biological
mechanism of energetics-brain associations. With a transdisciplinary mentorship team, the applicants career
development plan builds on his previous research training to gain proficiency in: 1) advanced neuroimaging
techniques, using PET and MRS, 2) physical activity-related measures of energy expenditure and post-exercise
MRS assessment of oxidative capacity (a correlate of mitochondrial function), 3) cognitive changes associated
with aging and ADRD, 4) longitudinal statistical analysis, 5) professional development, and 6) responsible
conduct of research. The research objectives and training goals of this K01 award will provide a learning
environment to advance the applicants knowledge in cognitive aging and ADRD and facilitate his transition to an
independent investigator examining the impact of modifiable lifestyle activities on cognitive decline in older
persons."
10742945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-transcriptional modifications by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing are a major contributor to the
global diversity of RNA sequences in the human brain. A-to-I editing occurs either at an isolated adenosine
(‘selective editing’) or across many neighboring adenosines in an extended region on the same transcript (‘hyper-
editing’). These base-specific alterations occur across most neuronal and non-neuronal expressed genes, and
are required for normal brain function. A-to-I editing has been shown to influence alternative splicing, recode
amino acid sequences of proteins, alter the ability of miRNAs to bind to their target sites, and change the stability
of RNA secondary structures. Moreover, recent work show that these modifications are tightly regulated in the
brain, and changes in editing levels are tied to etiology of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders,
including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nevertheless, major gaps exist in understanding the neuropathological roles
of A-to-I editing in the AD brain. The vast majority of sites are likely to be dynamically regulated among different
cell types, brain regions in AD and across dementia severity. Yet, the status quo as it pertains to such context-
dependent regulation of RNA editing can be summarized as little or none. Moreover, while most efforts have
studied individual selective A-to-I editing sites independently, there is a complete dearth of research on the role
of A-to-I hyper-editing and hyper-edited genes in AD, which have profound effects on transcriptional and
translational regulation. Finally, while existing studies on the regulation of RNA editing mainly focused on the
adenosine deaminase acting on RNA enzymes, the role of cis-acting genetic regulation (editing quantitative trait
loci [edQTLs]) has been understudied and underpowered. This proposal will capitalize on the success of large-
scale genomics and consortia efforts to elucidate functional and highly regulated RNA editing sites in normal
aging and AD at a previously impossible scale. The current proposal is designed to overcome current knowledge
gaps by: Aim 1) Addressing the unmet need for basic neuroscientific research that can capture fundamental
regulation of RNA editing across multiple brain regions and cell types in normal aging and AD; Aim 2) Integrating
individual genetic information from large cohorts to build powerful edQTL maps and uncover credible sets of AD
risk loci that exert their pathogenic effects by changing RNA editing levels in the brain; Aim 3) Applying data-
driven computational methods to annotate and prioritize functionally important RNA editing sites and hyper-
edited genes strongly linked to AD, thereby advancing our understanding of the complex etiology of AD through
the lens of RNA modifications. Results from this proposal will generate a more complete picture of the molecular
and genetic landscape of AD, and will advance the identification of new therapeutic targets."
10891348,"This project will elucidate the biological mechanisms by which obesity alters the myocardium in patients
with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) to ultimately derive sorely needed precision-
guided therapies. HFpEF currently represents more than half of all heart failure worldwide, its prevalence
is rising, morbidity and mortality are substantial, and yet we still have very few effective therapies. It is a
major unmet medical need and a disease priority for the NIH. One of the factors that has made it difficult to
treat is a major transformation over the past two decades such that most patients are now obese, many
severely, with diabetes and metabolic syndrome also very common. This obesity-metabolic syndrome
(OMS-HFpEF) phenotype has altered disease manifestations and progression and worsened prognosis.
Yet our knowledge of the underlying myocardial pathobiology effects from obesity are limited. Johns
Hopkins has established a dedicated clinical HFpEF Center that obtains detailed phenotyping of HFpEF
patients, the majority being OMS-HFpEF, African American, and female. The phenotyping includes
obtaining myocardial biopsies that have already provided novel insights into cellular and molecular
features. Our recent studies revealed less fibrosis than predicted, and that fat metabolism and glucose
metabolism seem both to be depressed in OMS-HFpEF, pairing abnormalities found in HF with reduced EF
and obesity/diabetes respectively, in essence a worst of both worlds that limits fuel flexibility. Yet unlike
HFrEF, oxidative phosphorylation seems enhanced particularly in obese patients. We also find a strong
inverse correlation between obesity and calcium-stimulated myofilament function – being very depressed in
OMS-HFpEF ± diabetes, hypertension, or LV hypertrophy. Obesity is thus a major driver for fundamental
changes in HFpEF. This R35 Program dissects metabolic and sarcomeric dysregulation in OMS-HFpEF,
starting with analysis of human myocardial tissues, and testing abnormalities in animal models that have
both marked OMS and cardiac hemodynamic stress. Models are benchmarked to pair with human
molecular/cellular pathobiology, rather than only organ level physiology as historically done. Our metabolic
studies will determine the fuel substrates used by OMS-HFpEF heart, where bottlenecks in fuel metabolism
occur, how these maybe circumvented and what the impact is, which metabolites are formed that can
impact epigenetics (histone modifications) to alter gene programs controlling metabolism and other key
cellular functions. Major interest is on Krebs cycle intermediates such as citrate, succinate and fumarate
and polyamines, that can impact histone methylation and acetylation. Our myocyte studies will determine
how obesity depresses sarcomere function, find the protein(s) and structural changes involved, their
causes, and prove causality. Lastly, we will test therapies to improve metabolic flexibility and sarcomere
performance in OMS-HFpEF that can lead to precision-guided medicines for this common phenotype."
10784719,"Older adults (i.e., those 65 years of age and older) account for more than 25% of all US hospital trauma
admissions, primarily due to falls and collisions. Given the aging population of the US, by 2050, approximately
40% of all trauma patients are estimated to be over the age of 65. Trauma patients experience high rates of
pain. Opioid medications are commonly used to manage trauma-related pain, but contribute to excess
morbidity, including risk of addiction, delirium occurrence, constipation, and falls. In addition, adverse events
resulting from opioid use increase hospital length-of stay, overall costs, risk of infection, and delays outpatient
rehabilitation. Multiple authorities have called for the development and testing of nonpharmacologic pain
mitigation approaches in this population, but few are in use. To address this gap, we propose to evaluate a
novel pain treatment, social virtual reality (SVR), in older adult trauma patients, in a two-step study to examine
feasibility, usability, and acceptability for patients, their friends and family, and, as a secondary measure,
clinicians who are involved in patient care. We will present existing versions of SVR to 10-15 patients, interview
them, and make iterative refinements according to their feedback. In the second part of this study, we will
conduct an uncontrolled pilot study with 25-30 older hospitalized patients, to establish the feasibility, usability,
and acceptability of SVR, and of data collection protocols and data availability to capture differences pain,
anxiety and mood. Patients will identify a “partner,” a family member or close friend, with whom they would like
to experience SVR, and a research assistant (RA) will provide headsets and intensive technical support for
both patient and partner. We will assess feasibility, usability and acceptability through successful recruitment
and completion of the study protocol, as well as through surveys using standard measures of usability and
acceptability for both groups: patients and partner. We will also examine differences in patient pain, anxiety,
and mood, measuring these outcomes pre- and post-intervention by survey as well as using a method of
ecological momentary assessment based on surveys in the headset and tracking user data."
10869934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Morbidity and mortality in children with sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are substantial.
Timely delivery of effective antibiotic concentrations to the site of infection dictates treatment outcomes, but
antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK) are highly variable in septic children, frequently leading to sub- or supra-
therapeutic antibiotic concentrations. To ensure optimal clinical and microbiologic outcomes, attainment and
maintenance of safe and effective antibiotic concentrations throughout the treatment course are paramount.
Despite this, antibiotic dosing in children with sepsis is based primarily by a child’s weight and kidney function,
without regard to other sources of PK variability, while clinical measurement of antibiotic concentrations is
performed for very few drugs. The host response to infection is a major driver of organ dysfunction and
antibiotic PK variability in pediatric sepsis: hyperinflammation, as well as sepsis-induced immune dysfunction
(i.e. immunoparalysis), are both common and exacerbate outcomes. Further, in critically ill children with
respiratory failure, bacterial burden and composition of the respiratory tract microbiome impact both host
inflammation and clinical outcomes. Understanding how the host immune response, antibiotic PK, and the
microbiome interrelate, and influence clinical outcomes, is imperative to optimize treatment in pediatric sepsis.
The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) will perform two concurrent, double-
blind, placebo-controlled RCTs to evaluate the impact of individualized immunomodulation (anakinra for
hyperinflammation; GM-CSF for immunoparalysis) on organ function outcomes in pediatric sepsis-induced
MODS. These trials (named PRECISE) provide a unique framework for evaluating the interplay between host
immunophenotype (hyperinflammation, immunoparalysis), immunomodulation, and antibiotic PK/PD through
our proposal. We will leverage PRECISE trials and CPCCRN infrastructure to evaluate sources of PK
variability in children with sepsis and MODS, investigate how host immune responses longitudinally modulate
antibiotic concentrations, and study how antibiotic concentrations impact organ dysfunction duration and the
respiratory tract microbiome. In Aim 1, we will determine the influence of host immunophenotype and response
to immunomodulation on antibiotic PK early (1A) and throughout the course (1B) of pediatric sepsis-induced
MODS. Aim 2 focuses on understanding how antibiotic concentrations impact organ function outcomes in the
context of immunomodulation in pediatric sepsis-induced MODS. Lastly, Aim 3 will quantify how antibiotic
concentrations, immunophenotype and immunomodulation impact the respiratory tract microbiome over time in
septic children with respiratory failure. By quantifying antibiotic concentrations and evaluating the drivers of
antibiotic PK in sepsis in the context of immunomodulation, our proposal will facilitate development of
individualized treatment strategies during sepsis-induced MODS."
10788463,"The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Robert Wirka protected time, allowing him to obtain the training
necessary to become an independent investigator using human genetic findings to define novel mechanisms
driving coronary artery disease (CAD). Career development activities are designed to strengthen Dr. Wirka's
skills in three key areas necessary for achieving this research paradigm: i) Linking disease-associated variation
to causal genes; ii) Determining how causal genes affect cellular and vascular biology; and iii) Defining the
molecular pathways and networks affected by causal genes. His mentor, Dr. Quertermous, will guide and
monitor his progress towards independence. During atherosclerosis, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) de-
differentiate, proliferate and migrate into the lesion in a process known as “phenotypic modulation”. In a recent
first-author paper in Nature Medicine, Dr. Wirka generated single-cell gene expression datasets from diseased
mouse and human arteries and characterized the process of SMC phenotypic modulation in unprecedented
detail. In the current proposal, Dr. Wirka has used these data to identify the transcription factor TWIST1 as a
potential novel regulator of SMC phenotypic modulation. In pathway analysis of the mouse and human gene
expression data, TWIST1 is strongly predicted to promote SMC phenotypic modulation. Consistent with this
predicted role, TWIST1 gene expression increases in SMCs during phenotypic modulation in the mouse and
human single-cell data, and preliminary studies show that TWIST1 inhibits expression of SMC differentiation
markers. Importantly, TWIST1 is also strongly associated with multiple vascular diseases, including CAD, in
human genetic studies. The proposed studies will determine the role of TWIST1 in vascular SMCs during
disease, and determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this occurs. In Aim 1, SMC-
specific conditional Twist1 knockout mice will be used to determine how Twist1 affects SMC phenotype within
the atherosclerotic lesion: i) assessment of single-cell gene expression will be used to determine the effect of
SMC-specific Twist1 knockout on the ability of SMCs to undergo phenotypic modulation during disease and to
map the molecular pathways affected by Twist1, and ii) in situ studies of the diseased artery wall will examine
the effect of SMC-specific Twist1 knockout on classical aspects of lesion phenotype and the contribution of
SMCs to the lesion. In Aim 2, cultured human coronary artery SMCs (HCASMCs) will be used to determine the
cellular and molecular effects of TWIST1: i) the effect of TWIST1 perturbation on SMC phenotypes relevant to
atherosclerosis such as differentiation, proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell death will be determined, and
ii) the detailed molecular mechanism by which TWIST1 inhibits expression of the SMC differentiation marker
ACTA2 will be explored. These studies will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which a CAD-
associated gene and potential novel SMC master regulator influences disease risk. Importantly, these studies
will also provide Dr. Wirka with the final skills necessary to achieve scientific independence."
10788430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder of aging, affecting about 44 million
people worldwide with 5.5 million in the U.S. Amyloid plaques in the brain, one of the pathological hallmarks of
AD, consist of fibrillary forms of amyloid β peptide-40 (Aβ-40) and amyloid β peptide-42 (Aβ-42) produced from
amyloid precursor proteins by sequential cleavage, and are crucial for the neuro-pathogenesis of AD. Despite
major drug development efforts targeting Aβ peptide cleavage and processing, nearly all experimental drugs
tested for AD thus far have failed to show significant efficacy. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed
to offer new prevention and treatment opinions for AD that represents a major unmet medical need. Aβ
aggregates induce oxidative stress and inflammation leading to microglia activation and neurodegeneration in
the brain. This process is fueled by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23, secreted
by CD4+ T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, which are found to be elevated in the peripheral blood of individuals with AD
dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCIAD) over normal aging control subjects. Notably, we discovered
that expression of Rorc, a major transcription factor of microglia, and target genes Il18, Nos2, and Casp4 are
markedly increased in the brain of AD and MCIAD patients over healthy aging controls, and Rorc up-regulation
is more profound in female than male AD patients. We further found that IL-17 and TNFa, produced by Th17
cells, induce transcriptional expression of Rorc, Il6, Il18, Il23, and Tnfa in mouse microglia. Since IL-23 can
induce pathogenic Th17 cell development, we postulate that Th17 and microglial cells likely act in a positive
feedback loop to promote inflammation contributing to AD pathogenesis. Importantly, our new bromodomain
inhibitor that selectively targets major transcription regulator BRD4 effectively inhibits transcription of Il17, Il21,
Il22, Rorc and Il6 in mouse Th17 cells, and Il6, Tnfa, Il18, Il23, Nos2, and Casp4 in mouse primary microglia.
Furthermore, MS402 blocks over-production of Th17 cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in
mice, a model mimicking the neuroinflammatory disorders in humans. Our results strongly suggest a promise
of our Th17/microglia immunomodulators as a new treatment for AD. Motivated by our favorable findings, in
this study, we will (1) investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of Th17 and microglial cells in
AD pathogenesis; (2) develop and characterize Th17 and microglial immunomodulators for AD treatment; and
(3) investigate in vivo therapeutic efficacy of Th17 and microglial immunomodulators in AD mouse models."

The long-term goal of the proposed career development award is to provide me with the training necessary to
develop an independent research program focused on elucidating the genetic, biological and cognitive
heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. An emphasis on the genetics of biological pathways in the
proposed project will complement my existing background in cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging. The
training goals are to: 1) gain training in lab management and develop a multi-disciplinary research program to
study AD; 2) gain specific expertise in molecular genetics; and 3) receive training in the biological processes
that contribute to AD. These training goals are mutually informative and will be achieved through a mix of
formal coursework, hands-on methodological training, and informal discussion. The Psychiatry Department at
the University of California, San Diego is an ideal environment in which to receive this training due to the
strong presence of world-renown researchers, track record of career development, and state-of-the-field
research facilities. Standard models of AD propose a characteristic sequence of pathological events that may
accurately describe the progression of some, but not all individuals. However, the failure of AD treatment trials
suggests that standard models are not complete. Prior studies have identified variability in domains of cognitive
impairment, levels and sequence of pathological events, and the topography of atrophy and pathology in the
brain. Interestingly, variability in these biological measures appears to correlate with variability in cognitive
impairment. These findings provide evidence suggesting that even “typical” AD may comprise multiple disease
subtypes, yet it is unclear to what extent they arise from different etiologies requiring different treatments.
Genetic risk in complex diseases such as AD can be summarized using polygenic risk scores (PRSs), but
these measures only consider risk along a single continuum, which may obscure different sources of genetic
risk. The scientific component of the project will seek to identify genetic subtypes using multiple AD PRSs
specific to biological pathways. This project will address two key questions: 1) Is the genetic etiology of AD
multidimensional, and 2) how does variability in the genetic risk for AD relate to heterogenous biological and
cognitive expressions of the disease? The specific aims are to: 1) determine whether there are subtypes of AD
genetic risk using pathway-based PRSs; 2) test whether biological subtypes of AD are associated with different
forms of AD genetic risk; and 3) examine whether cognitive impairment subtypes are associated with different
forms of AD genetic risk. The project will focus on 4 large-scale studies with multiple biological, cognitive, and
genetic measures: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging,
Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging, and UK Biobank. Characterizing the variability of disease etiology will inform
efforts to develop targeted intervention strategies relevant for disease subtypes. It will also allow more accurate
groupings of individuals by subtype to improve sensitivity in detecting disease and therapeutic effects."

RFA-AI-20-001 (Combating Antibiotic-resistant Bacteria Interdisciplinary Research Units (CARBIRU)).
Our proposal is leveraged to translate basic science into new types of antibiotic-sparing medicines for common
infections in the United States as well as common hospital-acquired infections. This U19 application utilizes a
multi-departmental, multi-institutional, and interdisciplinary group of highly motivated microbiology, cell
biology/physiology, immunology and medicinal chemistry researchers to develop antibiotic-sparing
therapeutics and compounds that are capable of: i) treating common infections; and/or ii) increasing sensitivity
to the current arsenal of available antibiotics. The Administrative Core (AC) will be responsible for coordinating
the activities and monitoring the progress of the three research projects and the two scientific cores to achieve
the overall goals of the U19 program. To accomplish this, the AC Leader, with the help of an Executive
Committee comprising of the Leaders of the Research Projects and Cores, will oversee and coordinate the
activities of the members of the Projects and Cores by: i) fostering frequent interactions; ii) supporting the
exchange of data, methodologies, and ideas; iii) facilitating interactions with institutional and outside experts to
gain advice for better functioning of the overall program and for translation of the program's findings into

10798154,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The current COVID-19 pandemic has shown us first-hand the dire
consequences that being unprepared for potential health crises can bring, and has reminded society as a
whole of the disastrous impact that infectious diseases can still have on overall human health and society. The
emergence and rapid dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens poses a severe looming global
crisis and an increasingly dire threat to overall human health. This U19 seeks to combat this growing crisis
through the generation and development of antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that are specifically targeted against
key virulence mechanisms used by pathogenic bacteria. CORE 1 will be fully integrated, working with the each
of the Scientific Projects providing computational and synthetic medicinal chemistry in the design, creation and
characterization of small molecule therapeutics that will target common bacterial virulence mechanisms and
viability to treat causative agents of infections, regardless of the pathogen's antibiotic susceptibility profiles.
With Project 1, this CORE will produce small molecule glycoside-based bacterial adhesin lectin domain
antagonists that are critical for E. coli, Klebsiellsa, Acinetobacter and Enterococcus to cause urinary tract
infections (UTIs) and catheter-associated UTIs. This work is based on a deep understanding of the structures,
ligands and biological functions of uropathogen adhesins. This team has already successfully developed
rationally-designed glycosides. Notably, a candidate FimH antagonist called a mannoside, developed by
CORE leader Dr. Janetka, has been approved for Phase 1a/1b clinical trials in humans. This is a clear
validation of the approaches in this proposal. With Project 2, we will target the assembly machinery of the
ubiquitous chaperone usher pathway (CUP) systems, which a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria,
including those of interest to this RFA, use to elaborate adhesive pilus on their surface to mediate distinct
binding to particular host surfaces and tissues. Ring fused 2-pyridones called pilicides have already been
developed that act as peptidomimetic inhibitors of the chaperone CUP system. We will expand on these
studies to target the outer membrane assembly protein, the usher, to block its function and increase the
permeability of the outer membrane to other antibiotics. With Project 3, we seek to expand our collection of 2-
pyridone based compounds named GmPcides (Gram positive cides), which we have found are bactericidal
against a wide variety of Gram-positive pathogens that cause healthcare associated infections. CORE leader
Dr. Almqvist's expertise in designing and optimizing these compounds will be critical for the successful
completion of projects 2 (pilicides) and 3 (GmPcides). Core leaders Dr. Janetka and Dr. Almqvist have
extensive expertise in synthetic organic chemistry, and in the rational design and synthesis of therapeutics.
The combined knowledge and past success from these two groups will provide strong chemistry support and
drug discovery leadership to all 3 projects of this U19 proposal."
10798159,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT SUMMARY:
Antibiotic resistance is increasingly a threat to human health resulting in difficult to treat infections, with some
multidrug resistant pathogens being resistant to all or most all antibiotics. To combat this growing crisis, this
U19 is taking an integrated approach to the generation and development of therapeutics against key virulence
mechanism of bacteria. Specifically, this CORE will in an integrated approach with Projects 1 and 2, seek to
develop monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies against different bacterial adhesins that extensive studies have
shown to be critical for the ability of pathogens to bind to and resist removal from host tissues and surfaces.
Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) use CUP adhesive pili tipped with adhesin proteins to bind to a variety of human
tissues including the uninflammed bladder, the inflamed bladder, the kidney, urinary catheters and the
gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In addition, Klebsiella expresses a mannose binding FimH adhesin that is critical for
the ability of Klebsiella to cause UTIs. Further, CUP adhesins in Acinetobacter baumanii, CupD and PrpD, as
well as the EbpA adhesin at the tip of the sortase assembled pilus of the Gram-positive Enterococci, bind to
fibrinogen on implanted catheters to promote biofilm formation and catheter-associated UTIs (CAUTIs). In
collaboration with Project 1 this CORE will use state of the art high throughput cloning and selection methods
to generate mAbs against all of these adhesins and evaluate their potential as antibiotic sparing therapeutics.
These mAbs will also elucidate important epitopes for future anti-adhesin vaccine design. Further, all of the
CUP adhesive pili are assembled by homologous systems involving a periplasmic chaperone and and outer
membrane usher. The usher is a five domain assembly platform for CUP pilus polymerization and its
transmembrane domain functions as a pore for extrusion of the assembled fiber. This pore is gated by a plug
domain that only exits the pore when the usher is assembly a pilus fiber. Thus, usher proteins will be targeted
for mAb generation and mAbs will be selected for both their ability to bind and inhibit usher mediated pilus
assembly and/or for the ability to “open” the usher pore in the absence of a growing pilus fiber. Having an open
pore without a pilus fiber will render the bacteria sensitive to antibiotics from our existing arsenal that are not
generally able to cross the Gram-negative outer membrane and thus are not generally efficacious against
Gram-negative pathogens. Targeting of adhesins and their assembly has the advantage that mutations in the
binding pocket of targeted adhesins or in critical assembly sites in the usher to prevent binding of the
therapeutic to its target would likely destroy adhesin function and thus render the pathogen non-virulent. The
mAbs generated have the promise to be a viable alternative for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infecitons.
Therapeutic mAbs have not yet been fully harnessed for treating infectious diseases, perhaps due to the
historic success of antibiotics. However, with antibiotic resistance on the rise, it is time to apply these
potentially antibiotic-sparing tools to infectious disease."
10798164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The climate surrounding COVID-19 has dramatically reminded us of the dire consequences of being
unprepared for health crises. One looming health crisis is the surge of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections
that are no longer sensitive to our life saving antibiotic arsenal. Thus, this project is leveraged to translate basic
science into antibiotic-sparing medicines for one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States,
urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as the most common hospital-acquired infection, catheter-associated
UTIs (CAUTIs). The strategy is to develop therapeutics that work equally well against carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae,
including the cause of over 80% of community-acquired UTIs, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). CAUTIs
pose a significant challenge for healthcare globally. While UPEC causes 50% of CAUTI, other pathogens,
including ESBL and CRE Klebsiella, multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter and Gram-positive Enterococcus
including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), cause a significant proportion of CAUTIs. These MDR
pathogens express adhesive factors required for colonization and infection in different host habitats involved in
acute and chronic/recurrent UTIs as well as in CAUTIs. Small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
will be developed that will treat and prevent disease by blocking these critical host-pathogen interactions. By
acting extracellularly, these antibiotic-sparing therapeutics will be recalcitrant to intracellular mechanisms of
resistance and avoid a common obstacle of cell permeability in drug discovery of small molecules. UPEC,
Klebsiella and Acinetobacter express chaperone usher pathway (CUP) pili tipped with adhesins: i) FimH,
FmlH, YehD, UclD (UPEC); ii) FimH (Klebsiella) and iii) CupD (Acinetobacter). These adhesins are critical for
colonization of the bladder (FimH), inflamed bladder and kidney (FmlH), gut (FimH, UclD and YehD) and
catheters (FimH and CupD). Further, Enterococcus faecalis express EbpA-tipped sortase-assembled pili,
which are critical in CAUTI. Glycomimetics have shown great promise in neutralizing CUP adhesins in vivo to
treat disease. For example, mannosides which neutralize FimH function, are potent therapeutics for treating
and preventing UTI, since FimH is required by UPEC to colonize the bladder. Validating the work in this
proposal, a mannoside has been selected, in collaboration with GSK, to proceed into phase 1a/ab clinical trials
in humans. Also, a FimH vaccine has completed Phase 1a/1b clinical trials. The use of mAbs has
revolutionized treatments for cancer, inflammatory, and neuronal disorders. Therapeutic mAbs have not yet
been fully harnessed for treating infectious diseases, perhaps due to the historic success of antibiotics. In this
project, we will develop therapeutic mAb designed to prevent critical host-pathogen interactions by neutralizing
the adhesins described above. The combined strategies have the potential to produce transformative
antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that work equally well against and antibiotic-sensitive and resistant infections."
10798173,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
The rise of antibacterial resistance highlights the urgent need to develop new effective strategies to combat
antibiotic-resistant infections. Ubiquitously, Gram-negative bacterial pathogens assemble extracellular fibers,
termed chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) pili, that are critical for the pathogen's ability to cause infections by
recognizing and colonizing different host tissues and habitats. Thus, therapeutics targeting the assembly of
these fibers hold promise in their potential to result in much needed alternatives for the treatment of multidrug-
resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Among these pathogens are those designated as “Urgent Threats”
carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), as well as “Serious
Threats” drug-resistant Campylobacter, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing
Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, drug-resistant Salmonella, Shigella, and
Bordetella pertussis. In each CUP pilus system, a designated periplasmic chaperone and an outer-membrane
(OM) usher protein work together to assemble thousands of structural subunits into each final pilus structure.
Most CUP pili are also tipped by adhesins that specifically recognize receptors in host tissues. We have made
considerable progress towards understanding the remarkably complex mechanisms of pilus assembly. Building
on our extensive experience and expertise in CUP pilus biogenesis and in the development of rational
therapies targeting CUP pili, this proposal seeks to develop novel antibiotic-sparing therapies targeting the OM
ushers using multidisciplinary approaches including bacteriology, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry,
structural biology and immunology. Based on the structural characterizations and the dynamic nature of these
multi-domain usher proteins, we will rationally develop small molecule usher inhibitors and pore openers by
trapping specific conformational states (Aim 1). Usher inhibitors will disarm bacterial virulence factors, whereas
pore openers will increase permeability of existing antibiotics into bacterial outer membranes. In addition, we
will develop monoclonal antibodies that inactivate usher, thus preventing pilus biogenesis and infection (Aim
2). While our first two aims will concentrate on two of the most studied pilus systems (type 1 and P pili), Aim 3
will expand our studies of ushers in Acinetobacter, Campylobacter, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella, Shigella, and B.
pertussis. Collectively, we plan to develop rational therapies against multiple antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative
bacterial pathogens. These developments, together with other novel strategies proposed in our
multidisciplinary U19 program, will work synergistically to act as efficient antibiotic-sparing therapeutics by
blocking usher and adhesin functions. Moreover, the usher pore openers developed in this proposal will
increase OM permeability, further alleviating antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens and allowing us
to repurpose existing drugs to enhance the current antibiotic arsenal. Thus, successful developments in these
directions will be potentially transformative in combating antibiotic resistance."
10798178,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAI) have become a health care crisis and are a leading cause of death.
Further the hospital setting harbors a reservoir of lethal multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, two million
patients suffer from HAI annually, resulting in 100,000 deaths and up to $4.5 billion in additional health care
expense. Thus, there is a global health emergency due to the growing prevalence of infections caused by MDR
HAI pathogens.
 To combat these pathogens, we introduce GmPcides, a novel family of ring-fused 2-pyridone compounds
that are bactericidal against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive species, including all seven Gram-positive
species identified by the CDC as among the most significant antibiotic-resistant threats. These bacteria include
Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), erythromycin-resistant Group A
Streptococcus (S. pyogenes) and clindamycin-resistant Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae). Significantly,
GmPcides are active against non-dividing bacteria and at sub-lethal doses, can disarm resistance, to re-
sensitize MDR microbes to antibiotic treatment, both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of HAI infection to
standard-of-care antibiotics targeting multiple orthogonal processes. GmPcides have no effect on Gram-
negative viability or significant toxicity to host tissues. Our group developed GmPcides by combining the
talents of synthetic chemist Dr. Fredrik Almqvist with microbiologists Drs. Michael Caparon and Scott Hultgren
who propose to take advantage of their understanding of HAI pathogenesis and their unprecedented ability to
manipulate the substituent diversity of the 2-pyridone scaffold to address issues essential for the translation of
GmPcides, including: i) optimization of activity, stability and solubility through structure-activity relationship
(SAR) and structure-property relationship (SPR) studies; ii) Identification of the GmPcide target(s) using a
systems-level chemical-genetic approach and the comprehensive genetic resources available for the model
Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis; iii) optimization of activity against HAI bacteria growing in biofilm
communities; and iv) assessment of the in vivo efficacy of improved GmPcides in murine models of HAI
urinary tract and soft tissue infection. These experiments described here will lead to the identification of critical
druggable target(s) highly conserved among Gram-positive HAI pathogens and will lead to the development of
new antibiotic-sparing and antibiotic-disarming therapies to combat the challenge of MDR HAI Gram-positive
pathogens.

10809770,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder responsible for a number of debilitating complications such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular diseases. Bioactive lipids like sphingolipids (SPLs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T2D, and recent studies specifically link ceramides (Cers) with the pathophysiology of obesity and T2D. We hypothesize that Cers and other SPLs are critical modulators of pathophysiological processes driving the progression from normal glucose regulation (NGR), through prediabetes, to T2D and associated diabetic complications. We propose to use stored specimens from the Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort (POP-ABC) study of normoglycemic participants with parental history of T2D and the Diabetes Prevention Program/Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPP/DPPOS) which followed participants already diagnosed with prediabetes for the development of T2D. We will enroll and analyze samples from 200 normoglycemic individuals with no family history of diabetes, which will serve as normative controls. In Specific Aim 1, we will analyze Cer and related SPLs (glycosyl ceramides, sphingomyelins and long-chain sphingoid bases) from plasma samples of normoglycemic participants with no family history of diabetes and two cohorts from the POP-ABC study: normoglycemic participants who developed prediabetes (progressors) and who did not develop prediabetes (non-progressors), each at base line and at 5 years follow-up. We expect to determine a novel association of Cer burden with prediabetes and family history. In Specific Aim 2, like Aim 1, we will perform a comprehensive profiling of Cer and SPLs DPP/DPPOS samples longitudinally at baseline, at 2 year DPP and at 11 year DPPOS from participants who were randomized to ‘placebo’ group (no intervention). We will compare prediabetic participants who progressed to T2D with participants who had not progress to T2D by year 11 in DPPOS. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate SPL signatures in relation to the efficacy of interventions that reverse prediabetes and those that prevent T2D. Using three different groups from the POP-ABC and DPP/DPPOS studies, we will analyze Cer and SPLs levels as predictors of incident prediabetes and T2D during longitudinal follow-up of well-defined subgroups of participants. Our results will enable us to determine whether Cer and SPLs modulate the impact and magnitude of the interventions on glycemic outcome. In Specific Aim 4, we will analyze existing DPP/DPPOS data in a case- control design, to determine associations between Cers and microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Overall, results of the studies proposed here will advance our understanding of the role of Cers in the pathophysiology of prediabetes, diabetes and related complications. Further, our planned lipidomics analyses are designed to facilitate the discovery of novel predictive, prognostic and specific biomarkers for prediabetes, T2D, and vascular complications."
10793505,"Abstract
Glioblastomas (GBM) are aggressive and radioresistant brain cancers for which better therapeutic approaches
are desperately needed. GBM patients are treated with 50-60 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR), and concurrent and
adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Radiation still remains the most effective therapeutic
modality for GBM, yet these tumors inevitably recur, and the recurrent tumors are highly resistant to standard
therapy. Any improvement in therapy would require a better understanding of the basis of GBM recurrence and
therapy resistance of the recurrent tumor. Published research from our lab with transgenic mouse models has
established that IR is potently gliomagenic, and that gliomas arising after radiation exposure are marked by
genomic alterations such as MET amplification which promote a cancer stem cell phenotype and
radioresistance. This raises the possibility that genetic alterations in GBM cells wrought by radiation therapy
could render the recurrent tumor refractory to further therapeutic intervention. Exciting new results from our lab
show that radiation also promotes the development of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
in the brain microenvironment which promotes tumor development via secretion of growth factors like HGF
(ligand for MET). This suggests that radiation-induced senescence of normal brain cells in the vicinity of the
tumor could alter the microenvironment to promote tumor recurrence and radioresistance. Translationally
significant results from our lab show that novel “senolytic” drugs can selectively eliminate senescent astrocytes
in the brain and mitigate the pro-tumorigenic effects of SASP. We hypothesize that radiotherapy-induced
genetic alterations in GBM cells (e.g., MET amplification) cooperate with senescence-associated
changes in the brain microenvironment (e.g., HGF secretion) to promote tumor recurrence and
radioresistance. We propose to analyze if “senolytics” can selectively kill senescent brain cells arising
due to radiotherapy, thereby radiosensitizing GBM and delaying tumor recurrence. There is an urgent
need for experimental strategies to understand such “acquired” therapy-resistance mechanisms in GBM and
develop translational approaches. We have developed novel patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic
models of GBM recurrence for this purpose. Using these models, and human GBM specimens, we will
investigate (1) how MET amplification caused by radiotherapy might, via reprogramming transcription factors
like SOX2 and OLIG2, generate cancer stem cells with augmented DNA repair capabilities, (2) how secretion
of tumor promoting factors, like the MET ligand HGF, by senescent astrocytes might promote growth and
radioresistance of GBM cells with MET amplification, and (3) how cooperation between the GBM and its
senescent microenvironment can be negated with “senolytic” drugs in order to improve the outcome of GBM
therapy. This project can lead to the development of effective strategies to treat GBM that take into
consideration both changes to the GBM cell and the brain microenvironment during radiotherapy."

Sepsis and ischemic myocardial infarction (MI) are two critical illnesses with very high mortality. While their
etiologies are distinctively different, they share similar features of innate immune activation, marked tissue
inflammation, and acute cardiac dysfunction. Tissue inflammation, largely driven by innate immunity activation,
is a major determinant of cardiac injury in sepsis and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). We have found that
host cellular RNA and various miRNAs are released into the blood during murine/human sepsis and myocardial
I/R. Circulating host RNA is closely correlated with sepsis severity and contributes to myocardial I/R injury in
animals. RNAseq reveals that miRNAs are the dominant biotype (70%) of plasma RNAs in both healthy and
septic mice and human. Moreover, we have reported that these extracellular (ex)-RNAs and certain uridine-rich
ex-miRNAs function as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and drive innate immune response
through a TLR7-dependent pathway. Using a computer algorithm, we have identified two miRNA sequence
motifs proven to be essential for miRNA-induced innate immunity activation. Finally, genetic deletion of TLR7
attenuates cytokine storm/coagulopathy and improves survival in sepsis animals. The goal of this research
program is to delineate the function and mechanism of ex-miRNAs in innate immunity activation and in the
pathogenesis of sepsis and myocardial I/R injury. Specifically, we will address the following 3 key questions: 1)
What are the roles of ex-miRNAs in systemic innate immunity activation and cardiac dysfunction in sepsis, and
in myocardial inflammation and infarction following I/R? 2) What are the underlying mechanisms responsible for
ex-miRNA-mediated cardiac injury and dysfunction during sepsis and myocardial I/R? 3) Can we develop an
anti-miRNA or anti-TLR7 strategy to attenuate sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy and improve survival, and to
reduce myocardial injury after I/R? We will use both mouse models and biospecimens/clinical data of septic
patients. The proposed work represents a paradigm shift in miRNA biology – its unique function as a DAMP in
innate immunity and in two critical illnesses that are dominated by innate immunity-driven inflammation."
10784715,"Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging
The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which
is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique
of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition
unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal
motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume
reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total
acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the
development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of
fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure
fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this
approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo
investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal
MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re-
adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our
proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across
sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal
MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms
to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect
and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to
process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively
navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To
assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four
specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction;
2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head
motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using
MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to
advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental
neurology and neuroscience."
10824330,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global problem affecting 500 million people worldwide. Glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) is the clinical standard assay for the assessment of kidney function, however existing estimation
techniques are imperfect. Gold-standard, accurate, collection based GFR techniques are time consuming,
complex and rarely used, whereas cheap, effective GFR test like serum creatinine are often inaccurate. As a
result, CKD, particularly subclinical CKD (Stage 1 and 2, GFR 60-100 ml/min) is grossly under-diagnosed and
vastly understudied.
Accurate identification of CKD is particularly important in Black Americans. Despite recent improvements in
outcomes, CKD remains 15% more common, and end stage renal disease 3x more common in Black Americans
as compared to non-Black Americans. Medical policy, genetics, economics and social factors have all been
suggested as casual reasons for the observed inequities in renal outcomes. Unfortunately, until better screening
tools of early renal disease are available, the exact determinants of CKD will be difficult to establish.
Toward this end, we hypothesize that overcoming technical challenges related to motion sensitivity and
physiological MR modeling will enable renal functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) to generate
biomarkers that have superior safety, ease and accuracy as compared to existing GFR techniques
The proposed aims will develop, validate and test two novel methods of GFR determination in Black Americans
with a propensity for subclinical kidney disease.
Aim 1: Develop and Validate Robust Oximetry and DeoxyHb Dynamic Susceptibly Contrast (dDSC) MRI.
Aim 2: Develop and Validate Motion Robust, Blood Water, PROPELLER Renal Arterial Spin Labeling MRI.
Aim 3: Evaluate Non-Contrast rfMRI in Adult African Americans with Subclinical Renal Disease.
This proposal will consist of critical development and evaluation steps that will help characterize and facilitate
the rapid and widespread adoption of non-ionizing, non-contrast hydro/hemodynamic biomarkers of renal
function for a historically underserved population and all patients with kidney disease."
10799699,"Human genetic studies have provided lists of genes and loci associated with risk for neuropsychiatric
disorders including autism spectrum disorder and neurodevelopmental delay (ASD/ND), but to systematically
evaluate their functions and mechanisms remains a dauting task. What brain regions, cell types, and neural
circuits are involved in the pathological state? Do different risk genes and genetic variants affect the same sets
of brain regions, cell types, neuronal projection networks and circuits? To address these questions, we will
develop scalable genomic technologies to allow high-throughput, in vivo genetic screening with single-cell and
meso-scale spatial resolution readout from intact tissues. First, we aim establish a method, named Perturb-map,
to readout the spatial location, cytoarchitecture, and projectome of each perturbed cell from intact, whole brains
without sectioning (Aim 1). We will perform sparse perturbation using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in vivo and
harvest the brain with pooled genetic perturbations. Next, we will use hybridization-based detection and whole-
brain tissue clearing methods, to allow iterative rounds of light-sheet imaging to deduce gRNA perturbation
identities within an intact tissue. We will further incorporate imaging of fluorescent reporters and endogenous
markers to ask how the perturbation changes the cell type identity, anatomical distribution, morphology and
neuronal projectome from intact tissues. In parallel, this approach will be complemented with an improved in
vivo Perturb-seq with unprecedented scalability (Aim 2a-b). We will establish an AAV-based Perturb-seq system
to allow high scalability and flexible tissue-specificity. We will then apply it to study a panel of ASD/ND risk genes
across two brain regions. Pooled, sparse perturbation will be introduced during embryogenesis, and single-cell
multi-omic analysis and in situ Perturb-map analysis will reveal how each perturbation affect gene expression,
cellular migration, cytoarchitecture, and neuronal projectome for each specific cell type across brain regions
including neocortex and striatum, which are implicated in the disorders. This will allow the first in vivo screen with
3-dimensional, meso-scale optical readout with high spatial resolution. The PI has extensive experience and has
pioneered the in vivo Perturb-seq technology, and she has brought together a diverse team and expertise with
long-standing relationships and collaborations across the fields of tissue clearing and high-throughput imaging,
computational genomics, and human genetics (including non-Caucasian populations) for equitable biomedicine
(co-I Dr. Zhuhao Wu, LoS from Drs. Pejman Mohammadi, Joshua Levin, and Mireille Kamariza). Altogether, we
will establish Perturb-Map as a scalable and generalizable approach to study gene function in complex tissues.
We expect to identify the cell types, molecular networks, and projectomes affected by diverse ASD/ND risk gene
variants with unprecedented scale and resolution. Perturb-Seq and Perturb-Map will be modular and broadly
applicable genomic tools contributing to not only neuroscience but also many other tissue types and fields as we
move from gene variant to their mechanisms and functions."
10811583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 CD8+ T cells are critical to eradicate viral infections and tumors, as well as providing
long-lasting protection; however, not all immune responses elicit functional and durable immune
responses leading to loss of protection against intracellular pathogens and cancer. Effective T
cell immunity requires tight control to maintain the appropriate equilibrium between cellular
quiescence, activation and cell death. Elegant work has been done to elucidate the
transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic networks that regulate T cells. In contrast, much less is
known about how cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) regulates CD8+ T cell fate.
Proteostasis is maintained primarily through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation
(ERAD) and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. ERAD complexes recognize misfolded
proteins in ER and translocate them into the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. Sel1L is a
critical component of the ERAD complex, facilitating the recognition, retro-translocation and
subsequent proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Though the role of the
UPR has been studied in T cell responses, nothing is known how Sel1L/ERAD controls CD8+ T
cell fate. Using conditional deletion of Se1lL in murine T cells to disrupt ERAD, we recently
identified a novel role for ERAD in T cell quiescence and survival at steady-state. In additional
preliminary results, we demonstrate that antigen-specific CD8+ T cells experience dynamic ER
stress during acute viral infection and Sel1L is required to protect antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
in a cell-intrinsic manner from cell death following viral infection. Our long-term goal is to identify
molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell fates and discover novel therapeutic targets that can
be used to modulate human T cell responses against infections and tumors. The objective of
this proposal is to dissect how Sel1L/ERAD regulates CD8+ T cell fate at steady-state and
following infection. Our central hypothesis is that Sel1L/ERAD is required to maintain cellular
proteostasis in CD8+ T cells during homeostasis and following antigen activation. To test our
central hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims: 1) to determine how Sel1L/ERAD
regulates CD8+ T cell homeostasis and 2) to dissect the mechanisms by which Sel1L/ERAD
preserves CD8+ T cells following antigen activation. In this proposal, we will identify how
Sel1L/ERAD protects naïve and activated CD8+ T cells against dysregulated proteostasis,
inappropriate UPR activation and altered cellular metabolism. The completion of these aims will
lead to knowledge that has the potential for offering new therapeutic targets that can enhance T
cell responses to viral infections and improve protective vaccines responses."
10757961,"Myelin—the structure that encapsulates axons—is integral to efficient transduction of electrical signals and metabolic
support of neurons. Myelin deficits have been commonly identified in a wide range of brain disorders—from
neurodevelopmental to neurodegenerative—implicating dysmyelination as a prominent, but often underappreciated,
feature of many neurological disorders. Similar myelin deficiencies cause decrements in attention, memory, learning,
social behaviors, and motor function in preclinical models. To ultimately understand how myelination fails in these
brain disorders, we first must have a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving the proliferation and
maintenance of myelin-forming precursor cells. Developmental myelination during pre- and post-natal life and
neuronal activity-dependent adaptive myelination in adulthood both depend on oligodendrocyte precursor cells
(OPCs) and their progeny, myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. There remains an unmet need to define the mechanisms
mediating OPC dynamics during these two types of myelination and to reveal their roles in defining and refining
circuits and behavior in development and disease. The OPC is the most abundantly mitotic cell in the brain with 70-
90% of all dividing cells at a given time being OPCs. Based on published work showing that the circadian (~24 hour)
system—driven by the principal circadian molecular regulator Bmal1—regulates cell proliferation of numerous neural
precursor and stem cell populations and our preliminary data confirming the necessity of Bmal1 in OPC dynamics,
we aim to investigate how the circadian system regulates OPCs and consequent myelination. In addition to
dysmyelination, circadian phase-shifts and polymorphisms in circadian clock genes like BMAL1 have been
documented in individuals with autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s
disease, linking disruptions in circadian machinery with pathophysiology in these disorders. We posit that circadian
disruption of myelin-forming cells during development will lay the foundation for a broad range of brain pathologies.
In this proposal, we aim to elevate the current biological understanding of myelination. The proposed work will
investigate how the circadian system regulates myelination through 1) the development of two distinct but
complimentary genetic mouse models targeting Bmal1 knock down in OPCs to probe developmental myelination 2)
application of the environmental chronodisruptive chronic jet lag (CJL) model to developmental myelination, and 3)
diurnal changes in neuronal activity-induced adaptive myelination. Our preliminary data establish that genetic knock
down of the Bmal1-driven circadian clock in OPCs during embryonic and post-natal development results in a
reduction in 1) OPC density, 2) OPC proliferation, 3) myelination, and 4) myelin-associated behaviors. A
comprehensive understanding of the interplay between circadian modulation and OPC maintenance and myelination
will not only inform on mechanisms of brain health but will also establish insights into potential therapeutic strategies
targeting myelin-specific circadian regulatory processes in numerous brain disorders."
10769776,"ABSTRACT
TGF-β affects virtually all aspects of mammalian physiology starting from early embryonic development to adult
tissue homeostasis through regulation of diverse cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis. TGF-β signaling also plays an important role in cell metabolism, although there has been incremental
progress in understanding how it differentially regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and organelle
destruction. While such varying effects are theorized to occur primarily through slow-acting contextual gene
regulation, TGF-β is also capable of inducing more rapid, direct, and reversible changes in mitochondrial shape
and function through largely unknown mechanisms− a key aspect that represents an important knowledge gap
in the field. Our research program has focused on two powerfully opposing mechanisms by which two major
TGF-β effectors, Smad2 and TAK1, control mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics to achieve and maintain
metabolic homeostasis. We seek to understand mechanisms governing their organization, activation, and
regulation in mitochondrial remodeling and how they influence cell behavior using angiogenesis as a
developmental model system. Our studies will provide unique perspectives on how the complex TGF-β signaling
networks control mitochondrial dynamics to affect their metabolic, developmental and homeostatic roles in
vascular physiology."
10761803,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Diversity Action Plan (DAP) post-baccalaureate program in genomics
is to provide a transformative, mentored research experience for individuals from underrepresented groups with
an emphasis on trainees whose goals are to pursue advanced degrees and careers in genome-related fields.
Low participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) by individuals from
underrepresented groups is a recognized problem nationally (National Academies Press, 2011). Lack of
exposure to scientific research resources and mentors, economic factors, and cultural biases are barriers that
limit access to quality science education and, in turn, hinder the expansion of our nation's research capacity by
limiting contributions from a deep pool of intellectual talent.
The program will benefit from JAX's nine decades of success in training scientists at all career stages, including
those from underrepresented groups, by its world-leading mouse genetic, genomic, and computational
resources, and by its well-funded and productive faculty. The program will build upon programmatic infrastructure
for career development and a community of post-bacc peers from an existing post-bacc program at JAX. The
genomics DAP will be distinct from the existing post-bacc program as the focus for the proposed program will
be specifically on career development for basic research in the areas of genomics, genome technology, and data
science.
The program will host up to six post-baccalaureate fellows in a year with individuals distributed across the Bar
Harbor, Maine and Farmington, Connecticut JAX campuses. The three primary aims for the program will be (1)
Provide two-year mentored post-baccalaureate research experiences in genomics, genome technologies, and
data science for individuals from underrepresented minority groups; (2) Implement a curriculum that provides
knowledge, skills, and training complementary to the mentored laboratory research experience and, (3)
Incorporate formal and informal evaluation methods to strengthen the training program. Oversight for the
program will be provided by two PIs, one from each campus, and by Program Staff from the JAX Genomic
Education team. An Advisory Council comprised of internal and external individuals will evaluate the program's
effectiveness and provide guidance on sustaining a research workplace that is inclusive and equitable.
The alumni from the post-bacc program will contribute to building a research workforce that is representative of
our nation's population. They will bring unique perspectives and individual enterprise to setting and advancing a
research agenda in genomics and data science that benefits all people."

Modeling Core’s primary goal is to develop and apply computational and statistical methods to elucidate
key features of viral pathogens as well as host immune responses to infection and vaccination. Our
approach will integrate data both within and across measurement modalities using data-driven
mathematical tools to identify important host and virus factors, understand virus evolution and spread,
and predict patient outcomes. We will disseminate our ﬁndings and tools, enabling CViSB as well as
community researchers to perform similar analyses for a range of viral pathogens.
To accomplish these objectives and support the overall mission of CViSB, we have the following four
aims: (1) Build models to predict disease outcomes using data-driven latent variable models; (2) Develop
methods to study host-pathogen dynamics by integrating heterogeneous data; (3) Construct methods for
large-scale analysis of evolutionary dynamics; (4) Integrate social, environmental, and virus factors into
models to understand virus variant spread; and (5) Provide broad analysis support for CViSB and the
SysBio community."
10759420,"Project Summary - Project 1
The objective of this project is to generate an integrated, systems-level dataset that will enable
development of models that predict disease severity or long-term sequelae in individuals infected with
Lassa virus, Ebola virus or SARS-CoV-2, and protective responses to vaccines. The central hypothesis of
Project 1 is that multiple variables, including individual physiological, metabolic and immunological
factors, inﬂuence survival or development of long-term sequelae after infection by pathogenic RNA
viruses. Additionally, we seek to determine whether or not responses to vaccines will be protective. To
test this hypothesis, we have assembled unique West African and United States cohorts of individuals
who are at risk for Lassa, Ebola and COVID-19 or who have survived these illnesses. Clinical trials of
Lassa vaccines have recently been initiated at our clinical sites in West Africa, and we are also studying
the durability of Ebola vaccines and the potential of vaccination to prevent viral reactivation in Ebola
survivors. The proposed project brings together a strategically organized set of cutting edge systems
tools to capture the overall immunome, antibody-ome, and metabolome of Ebola, Lassa, and COVID-19
survivors. We will use machine learning to identify unique signatures of persistent infection/disease,
providing a path to diagnose, treat, and manage persistent disease following viral infection.
In Aim 1, we will deﬁne physiological and metabolic attributes that distinguish Lassa, Ebola and COVID-19
survivors, non-survivors, and individuals that develop post-infection sequelae by compiling and analyzing
clinical, immunological and nontraditional data, including data from wearables. In Aim 2, we will utilize
high-throughput technologies, including PhIP-Seq, VirScan, and Systems Serology, to derive deep datasets
to identify attributes of the humoral immune responses of Lassa, Ebola and COVID-19 patients, survivors,
and vaccinees that lead to diﬀerent outcomes. In Aim 3, we will characterize anti-coronavirus immune
responses in West Africans and compare the results to United States cohorts, with the goal of identifying
and characterizing potentially protective responses to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, in Aim 4 we will integrate
heterogeneous data types to investigate the importance of host and virus factors in determining
responses to vaccines and outcome of infection with diﬀerent variants of our three viruses of interest. We
will work with the Modeling Core to integrate these heterogenous data types using a combination of
advanced modeling, machine learning tools, and related technologies to identify predictive biosignatures
that inform: personalized treatment across sex, age, and racial diﬀerences; management strategies in
acutely infected individuals and those with long term viral syndromes such as PASC; and potential targets
for advanced therapeutics and improved vaccines."
10759429,"Project Summary - Project 2
The objective of Project 2 is to investigate the complex interplay of virus genetics and host immunity in
determining epidemiology and outcome of infection with Lassa virus, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV-2. Our
central hypothesis is that both host and virus factors play key roles in determining the severity of clinical
outcomes including survival, disease severity and the development of long-term sequelae. To test this
hypothesis, we will investigate viral genetics, development of host immunity, and how these processes
interact as a result of viral infection or vaccination. In focusing on the host-pathogen interface, we will
complement the host-focused studies from Project 1 to better understand the complex factors that
determine the clinical outcome and epidemiology of Lassa, Ebola, and COVID-19.
To accomplish this, we will complete the following: In Aim 1, we will reﬁne viral sequencing techniques to
generate large catalogs of Lassa virus and SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. We will then integrate these
data with environmental and demographic data and apply phylodynamic models to identify virus
mutations and variants most likely to have an eﬀect on disease severity. In Aim 2, we will perform single
cell sequencing and transcriptomics to deeply characterize the evolution of adaptive immunity in
response to acute Lassa virus infection or vaccination. We will also isolate monoclonal antibodies from
individuals previously infected with or vaccinated against Lassa virus, Ebola virus, or SARS-CoV-2 to
understand the diversity of the human humoral response. In Aim 3, we will extend the multi-omics work
proposed in Aim 2 to individuals infected with diﬀerent viral variants, with the goal of developing a
predictive model of immune response and clinical outcome. This model will integrate the systems
serology data from Project 1 as part of a framework of repeated cycles of experimental data generation,
integration, application, validation, and reﬁnement to identify predictive biological markers of human
disease and outbreak dynamics. Finally, in Aim 4, we will validate the ﬁndings from the previous aims in a
BSL-4 setting (the biosafety level required for working with live Ebola or Lassa virus) and use the results of
animal models to further reﬁne our predictive models of clinical outcome."
10771929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is associated with reduced quality of life and
survival making it a significant problem that remains understudied. Research by our group and others
has demonstrated that CRCI is associated with altered brain structure and function from pretreatment
to post treatment. There is significant overlap between chemotherapy actions and physiologic
processes involved in aging. Neurocognitive have been found in patients up to 20+ years post-
treatment and work by our group and others suggests an accelerated brain aging phenotype in breast
cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy. We have also observed that patients may demonstrate
unique trajectories of cognitive impairment that require further study. Existing prospective, longitudinal
studies of cancer and cognition, including our own, have been limited to relatively short-term post-
treatment follow-ups (e.g. 6-12 months). To begin addressing these limitations, we aim to extend our
current prospective study (CA172145), which longitudinally examines cognitive function and brain
structure/function pre-surgery, 1-month post chemotherapy, and 1-year post chemotherapy. We will
continue to assess cohorts of women treated with chemotherapy, chemotherapy naïve patients, and
healthy controls at yearly intervals for 5 additional years (up to 10 years). Using non-invasive
neuroimaging methods, we will advance our original aims from the initial project to measure very long-
term neurobiologic outcomes with an emphasis on the assessment of neural connectivity rather than
specific regional changes (Aim 1). We will also examine very long-term cognitive outcomes as
measured by standardized neuropsychological testing (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore different
trajectories or subtypes of impairment and their neural phenotypes (Aim 3). The proposed project will
significantly advance the understanding of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairments by extending
our knowledge on very long-term neurobiological outcomes along with the different subtypes of
cognitive impairments and associated neural profiles following breast cancer chemotherapy."

research is to improve human health by elucidating disease mechanisms and contributing towards efforts to
develop therapeutic strategies. This application will provide the framework to achieve these goals through a
coordinated career development plan that utilizes the expertise of a diverse team of mentors and advisors, and
the supplemental training opportunities provided by coursework and conferences. These factors are woven into
my research strategy addressing important questions in craniofacial development and mechanisms of
disorders and expands my training into new areas that are essential for my transition to an independent
researcher career. This includes becoming an expert in genetic and transgenic models of zebrafish, genome-
wide sequencing approaches like single cell ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq, and human craniofacial anatomy. My
mentor team, led by Drs. Clouthier and Nichols, will provide valuable guidance throughout the training plan,
including the academic job search and career transition process. Moreover, this training will be carried out at in
a stellar research environment in the Department of Craniofacial Biology, and the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus, that collectively have the resources, core facilities, and faculty members needed to
ensure the success of this career development plan. This application will address important yet unstudied
events in intracellular signaling downstream of the Endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) that establishes
patterning domains along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of pharyngeal arch 1 (PA1). EDNRA signaling is
required for lower jaw development and is disrupted in a human craniofacial disorder called Auriculocondylar
syndrome (ARCND). EDNRA can signal through all four classes of G proteins, though how dynamic use of
different G proteins by EDNRA to pattern different domains of PA1 is unknown and extremely difficult to study.
This proposal will use three aims to test the hypothesis that the Gq/11 class exclusively patterns the
intermediate domain of PA1, and that Gq/11 regulates patterning gene expression by inducing
genome-wide changes to chromatin accessibility. Aim 1 will use genetic and transgenic approaches to
determine whether Gq/11 is necessary and sufficient for intermediate domain patterning. Aim 2 will use
multimodal single-cell analysis to define cis-regulatory elements and gene regulatory networks controlled by
Gq/11. Aim 3 will use zebrafish models of ARCND to understand how disease alleles impact EDNRA-Gq/11
signaling. Furthermore, this information will be used to better understand human cases of ARCND.
Collectively, this comprehensive research training and career development plan will ensure my successful
transition from a mentored postdoc to a well-prepared independent researcher."
10766221,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SERCA2a Ca pump plays a central role in heart function. The speed at which SERCA2a removes Ca from the
cytosol is the main determinant of the rate of cardiac muscle relaxation. SERCA2a also sets the total amount of
Ca in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which determines the strength of cardiac contraction. It is not surprising,
that impaired SERCA2a function has been reported in a number of pathological conditions, including heart failure
(HF). Thus, understanding mechanisms of SERCA regulation is of great clinical importance. Besides activation
of muscle contraction, SR luminal Ca ([Ca]SR) plays an important role in regulation of SR protein function. While
SERCA2a activity controls [Ca]SR, less is known about how changes in [Ca]SR affect SERCA2a Ca transport. Our
preliminary results suggest that SR luminal Ca plays an important role in regulation of SERCA2a. In this project
we will use advanced structural analyses, innovative molecular biological techniques, new organelle-specific
sensors, state-of-the-art optical methods and in vivo gene delivery to explore this new mechanism of SERCA2a
regulation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that luminal Ca regulates SERCA2a by increasing the pump’s
catalytic efficacy and by relieving the phospholamban (PLB) inhibitory effect. Molecular dynamic simulations will
be used to select specific domains on the SERCA2a luminal side that are involved in Ca regulation. Site-directed
mutagenesis will be used to identify the specific amino acids that form the luminal Ca-binding sites and to develop
the luminal Ca-insensitive SERCA2a mutant. We will assess effects of the luminal Ca regulation on Ca transport,
the ATPase activity and the PLB interaction. Then, myocytes expressing the luminal Ca-insensitive SERCA2a
mutant will be studied to define the role of this novel mechanism in cardiac Ca cycling. We expect that the
outcome of this work will greatly advance our understanding of SERCA2a function. We expect that the outcome
of these studies will provide a detailed view of this new mechanism of SERCA2a regulation, advancing our
understanding of the Ca pump’s function. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that luminal redox potential regulates
SERCA2a by stabilizing its luminal Ca binding sites, thus, improving the pump’s regulation by [Ca]SR. Molecular
dynamic simulations will be used to forecast the role of the SERCA2a luminal disulfide bond in the pump catalytic
cycle. We will assess whether mutation of luminal cysteines leads to a loss-of-function phenotype by abolishing
SERCA2a regulation by luminal Ca. Newly developed approaches to measure luminal redox potential and [Ca]SR
will be used to define the cross-talk between luminal redox potential and SERCA2a activity. We will investigate
the contribution of this new mechanism to SERCA2a dysfunction and Ca mishandling in HF. The likely outcome
of these studies is a new concept that can explain how alterations in SERCA2a structure/function cause defects
in Ca regulation in HF."

The population of older adults in the U.S. is increasing dramatically, doubling from 48 million to 88 million
by the year 2050. As more Americans live longer, the challenge is to assure that quality of life is being
maintained along with quantity of life. Research is beginning to focus on understanding the changing
physiology underlying normal human aging, as well as expand on behavioral and pharmacological strategies
that may assist older adults to maximize their later years, and recent surveys suggest that some may believe
that legalized cannabis products have a role to play. Simultaneously, the increasing legalization and
acceptance of cannabis is occurring at a rapid pace. Older adults are the fastest growing group of cannabis
users in the U.S., with prevalence up by 250% for in some age groups, who perceive virtually no risk of using
cannabis monthly (85.3%) or even weekly (79%). National Surveys also showed that older adults were more
likely to use cannabis for medicinal purposes than for recreational purposes, and common reasons for use
include pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. There are obvious and critical questions that this situation
poses. First, do older adults experience relief from their symptoms and does this depend on the constituent
cannabinoids of the product they are using? Second, are there impacts on neurocognition and motor control
that might be harmful, or even potentially beneficial, and do these, too, depend on the cannabinoid profile of
the products being used? Third, how can we assist older adults in decision-making regarding cannabis?
 The overarching goal of this grant application is to leverage our innovative mobile pharmacology laboratory
approach and existing aging research infrastructure to better understand the effects of legal market cannabis in
adults aged 60 and over. To that end, the proposed research will utilize a prospective, patient-centered
observational design to recruit and assess older adults who are interested in using cannabis for pain,
trouble sleeping, or negative affect and a comparison group who are not interested in cannabis use.
Users will choose and use one of three types of edible cannabis products (i.e., a CBD dominant product, a
THC+CBD product, or a THC dominant product) for a total of three months. The proposed research has three
aims. First, we will explore the effects of edible cannabis of varying composition among older adults who desire
to use cannabis to treat their pain, trouble sleeping, or negative affect (depression/anxiety) as compared to a
non-sing comparison group assessed by changes in the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. Second
we will explore the effects of edible cannabis use of varying composition on neurocognition and motor control
both acutely and over time among older adults. Finally, we will examine the process by which older adult
cannabis users decide what type of cannabis product they prefer. Pursuit of these aims has tremendous"
10794249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neonatal clinical trials have difficulty including diverse populations of infants. Parents of infants who are racial
or ethnic minorities, report lower income, or have lower educational attainment are less often approached,
more likely to decline enrollment, and more likely to withdraw from neonatal research. Under-representation of
these populations results in an evidence base that may not be generalizable. This is crucial because these
infants are at higher risk for worse outcomes for many common neonatal problems and associated morbidity,
mortality, cost, and long-term disabilities. Under-representation in neonatal clinical trials thus exacerbates
existing health disparities. From a practical and ethical perspective, there is a critical need to address this
problem. The proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Elliott M Weiss as he develops
expertise in strategies to improve recruitment processes and enrollment diversity for neonatal clinical trials,
with a focus on under-represented populations. This project will facilitate training in three specific areas: 1)
health disparities, research participant diversity, and stakeholder engagement; 2) intervention development
and testing; and 3) research operations and clinical trials. Dr. Weiss’s career development will be supported by
a highly skilled mentoring team with expertise in qualitative methodologies, stakeholder engagement, and
intervention development and testing. The advisory team will provide further support in health disparities,
research participant diversity, research ethics and informed consent, and neonatal clinical trials. This training
and mentorship will inform the proposed research. The research will be guided by Intervention Mapping, a
rigorous technique for integrating theory and empirical findings to develop health interventions, in order to
achieve the goal of creating a modified recruitment approach that can lead to increased enrollment, more
generalizable results, and improved outcomes. Aim 1 is to describe how parents of under-represented
populations decide whether to enroll their infant in neonatal research. Aim 2 is to create a modified recruitment
approach designed to improve the recruitment process for families and to increase participation of under-
represented populations in neonatal research. Aim 3 is to pilot test the feasibility of implementing a modified
recruitment approach within a neonatal clinical trial. The environment in which Dr. Weiss will undertake this
project is unparalleled, with access to mentoring, coursework, clinical and office space, and research, grants
management, and administrative support. At the conclusion of this career development award, Dr. Weiss will
have the training, pilot data, and publications to allow him to successfully submit and undertake an R01-level
project testing the hypothesis that an ethically sound modified recruitment approach will improve the enrollment
process for all families and increase diversity and improve generalizability of neonatal clinical trials."
10766150,"ABSTRACT
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy among women, with less than half of women
surviving five years after diagnosis. Black women with ovarian cancer have worse survival compared to White
women. The causes of these disparities remain elusive as prior research suggests that it is not entirely due to
differential access to care or guideline-adherent treatment. Thus, it remains a high priority to uncover approaches
to reduce mortality and improve survival, especially for Black women. However, the majority of research on
ovarian cancer is from White women, which has hindered the discovery of novel factors important for prognosis
in underrepresented minority groups. Here, we will leverage epidemiologic, molecular, and outcome data from
well-established observational studies to investigate the methylomic basis of ovarian cancer survival disparities
between Black and White women. DNA methylation provides a unique opportunity to investigate disparities as
lifestyle and sociocultural conditions that are disparate between racial/ethnic groups may manifest as alterations
in tumor DNA methylation, resulting in phenotypic differences between populations. We hypothesize that Black
women will have a different composition of methylation patterns or a unique tumor DNA methylation signature
associated with poorer survival compared to White women. To limit contributions of disease heterogeneity, we
will focus on the most common and one of the deadliest histotypes, high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
(HGSOC). Among 239 Black and 478 White women with HGSOC, tumor DNA methylation will be measured
using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Frist, data dimension reduction methods will be used to determine
tumor DNA methylation signatures that are associated with survival among the overall study population and
among Black and White women separately, identifying differentially methylated regions associated with
outcomes that are specific to each race and those that are shared across race. These signatures will be validated
among an additional 200 Black and 200 White women with HGSOC. Second, the association between pre-
diagnostic exposures that have the potential to alter DNA methylation states (e.g., age at diagnosis, smoking
status) and outcome-associated DNA methylation signatures will be investigated to determine which factors may
be informative for preventive strategies. As DNA methylation is highly tissue specific, the DNA methylation
signature of the tumor is a weighted mixture of the methylation signature for each of the cells within the tumor.
Therefore, in the third aim, we will infer cell composition from tumor DNA methylation data using a novel cell
mixture deconvolution method, and examine whether inferred cell composition is associated with risk of mortality.
Comparing DNA methylation across populations has important applications as this work will advance the
discovery of molecular targets among an underrepresented racial minority group, aiding in clinical decision-
making and informing the development of personalized therapies to reduce mortality in Black women and
ultimately reduce the survival gap between Black and White women with ovarian cancer."

Project Summary
African genomic data has the potential to benefit researchers and clinicians world-wide, given
the African origin of global populations, and the current wide geographic spread of people with
African ancestry. However, African genomic data are sparse and often kept in silos or under
controlled access, usually not curated at an adequate level of granularity. The African
Genomics Data Hub (AGDH) Biomedical Knowledgebase aims to address these issues by
providing a centralized resource of curated genomic data for populations of African ancestry
to increase findability and accessibility. More specifically, the knowlegebase will serve as a
data submission centre to promote the submission of multi omics and genetic data to public
repositories, ensuring adherence to international standards and data quality. Existing data in
public repositories and the literature will be further curated and accessible via web portals
focussed on African-relevant information. Aggregated genomic data from populations of
African ancestry that are not available in gnoMAD or other databases for valid reasons, will
be served with appropriate access levels in the African Genome Variation Database hosted
by the AGDH. Datasets will be indexed and searchable via a catalogue to increase findability.
Additionally, tools and resources relevant to the processing and analysis of African data
(African pangenome and reference graph, African reference panel and imputation service)
that complement and fill gaps in international efforts will continue to be developed and
maintained. These will be used in the production of the AGDH resources. User support will be
provided through a help desk and continuous training. These activities draw on the extensive
experience and valuable outputs of the H3ABioNet consortium, which has been developing
capacity and resources for genomics in Africa for more than 9 years. All components of the
knowledgebase will work with public database counterparts in the USA and United Kingdom
(dbGAP, EGA, INSDC, GWAS Catalog, gnoMAD) to ensure alignment, avoid redundancy, fill
gaps, and cover niche areas The AGDH will collate and add significant value to African
genomic data and ensure findability and accessibility to the global scientific community that
would not otherwise be available, thus facilitating compliance with FAIR principles."

More than 60% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) contain PTEN and TP53 gene
deletions and mutations. To date, there are limited treatment options for this molecular subtype. The overall
objective of this application is to elucidate the complex role of B7-H3 signaling in prostate cancer (PCa) as well
as develop biomarker-driven B7-H3 targeted therapy for CRPC. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that
PTEN/TP53 defects induce B7-H3 overexpression and that depletion of B7-H3 in cancer cells remarkably
impaired progression of PTEN/p53-deficient PCa in vivo. Mass cytometry analysis revealed that B7-H3 signaling
is involved in modulating immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the PCa tumor microenvironment (TME). Here,
the central hypothesis is that B7-H3 signaling contributes to the progression of PCa containing PTEN/p53
deficiencies and plays a key role in reprogramming immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the PCa TME. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims. Aim 1. Elucidate B7-H3’s impact on
progression of advanced PCa containing PTEN/TP53 loss. The hypothesis in this aim is that B7-H3 plays a key
role in PCa progression and resistance to ADT and that PTEN/TP53 defects render CRPC more responsive to
B7-H3 targeted therapy. To this end, we have generated a novel GEMM with prostate-specific co-deletion of
Pten/Trp53/Cd276. This state-of-the-art spontaneous GEMM provides a unique tool to dissect the role of B7-H3
signaling in PCa development and therapeutic resistance. Mechanistic studies will illuminate how PTEN and p53
pathways control B7-H3 expression. Clinical relevance among B7-H3 expression, PTEN/TP53 status, and
disease progression will be assessed in human CRPCs. B7-H3 targeted therapies will also be tested in various
preclinical models of metastatic CRPC containing PTEN/TP53 loss. Aim 2. Understand how B7-H3 signaling
modulates immunosuppressive myeloid cells in CRPC. The hypothesis is that B7-H3 signaling contributes to the
reprogramming of myeloid cells in the PCa TME. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis will be performed in above
GEMMs. Functional studies will address how B7-H3 signaling mediates the crosstalk between cancer cells and
immunosuppressive myeloid cells. B7-H3 receptor(s) and the downstream signaling pathway(s) in myeloid cells
will also be characterized. Finally, the therapeutic potential of co-targeting B7-H3 and immunosuppressive
myeloid cells will be evaluated in preclinical models of CRPC. These studies are expected to have significant
positive impacts, including advancing the understanding of B7-H3 biology in cancers and providing a
compelling rationale for the use of PTEN and TP53 defects as molecular biomarkers for predicting response to
B7-H3-targeted therapy for patients with CRPC. The proposed research will also establish, for the first time, the
role of B7-H3 signaling in reprogramming myeloid cells in the TME and develop effective combinatorial
immunotherapy targeting B7-H3."
10909818,"Project Summary
CRISPR-Cas are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that protect bacteria and archaea from invading mobile
genetic elements, such as phages and plasmids. CRISPR-Cas systems acquire immunological memories during
infection by integrating short fragments from the invader’s genome into the CRISPR locus of the host. These
fragments, called “spacers”, are later transcribed into CRISPR RNAs that are loaded on Cas nucleases and
guide them to recognize and cleave infecting nucleic acids. Depending on their genetic composition, CRISPR-
Cas systems are classified into six types (I-VI). While spacer acquisition has been extensively studied in type I
and II systems, type III systems are just now starting to be explored. The overall goal of this application is to
define the molecular mechanisms that govern spacer acquisition by the prevalent, yet less studied, type III-A
CRISPR-Cas system, and understand its implications during CRISPR-Cas defense and tolerance. Preliminary
work on the type III-A system of Staphylococcus epidermidis revealed that this system preferentially acquires
new spacers by two independent modes. The first mode acquires spacers from some, but not all, highly
transcribed genes, and spans their entire transcribed region. The first aim of this proposal is to elucidate how
the acquisition machinery recognizes specific genes as substrates for preferential acquisition. This will be
achieved by dissecting the DNA sequences that recruit the spacer-integrase complex to specific genes, finding
host factors that mediate gene-specific spacer acquisition, and test for the physiological relevance of this process
during the CRISPR-Cas immune response. The second mode of acquisition by the type III-A system is similar
to the previously studied type I and II systems, where spacers are acquired from free dsDNA ends at the bacterial
chromosomal terminus, in a manner that is dependent on the cell’s DNA-repair machinery. Such self-targeting
spacers are expected to induce autoimmunity and be negatively selected, however we found them to be stably
fixed in the bacterial population, suggesting the existence of unknown mechanisms that inhibit targeting by Cas
nucleases at this site, thus preventing CRISPR autoimmunity. The second aim of this proposal will define the
genomic context that allows self-targeting spacers to be tolerated, analyze the temporal dynamics of CRISPR-
Cas immunity at free DNA ends, and explore the genetic components needed for CRISPR-tolerance and
accumulation of self-targeting spacers. This proposed work will not only transform our conceptual understanding
of the spacer acquisition process, but also could lead to CRISPR-based technological developments in molecular
biology and diagnostics. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a team of experts in the fields of transcription,
DNA repair, bioinformatics, biochemistry and biophysics. Their guidance, along with the continued mentorship
of Prof. Luciano Marraffini and the scientific environment of the Rockefeller University, will allow me to perform
the proposed research, as well as to develop writing, mentorship and communication skills, that will support my
successful transition to an independent career."
10774267,"Heart failure is a devastating disease with mortality rates exceeding many malignancies.
The pathophysiological basis of systolic heart failure lies in the inability of the adult
mammalian heart to regenerate lost or damaged myocardium. Although limited
cardiomyocyte turnover does in fact occur in the adult mammalian heart, it is insufficient
for restoration of contractile function following injury. In contrast to the adult mammalian
heart, my group has shown that newborn mammals have a remarkable endogenous
myocardial regenerative capacity, mediated by proliferation of preexisting
cardiomyocytes. Nevertheless, the mere realization that the heart is not a post-mitotic
organ created a lot of excitement in the past two decades and led to a flurry of bench and
clinical studies aimed at outlining the cardiac regenerative potential of various cell types.
While many of these studies may hold therapeutic promise, mounting evidence suggest
that cell therapy may enhance some endogenous repair or regenerative mechanisms such
as stimulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Importantly, current evidence suggests that
both the regenerative ability of the early postnatal heart, and cardiomyocyte turnover in
the adult heart are mediated by proliferative competency of pre-existing cardiomyocytes.
However, mechanisms of regulation of mammalian cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest shortly
after birth remain poorly understood. Therefore, we believe that a program focused on
understanding mechanisms of cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation could inform future
therapeutic interventions for heart regeneration. Our studies are focused on three broad
questions: 1) Is loss of the regenerative capacity of the mammalian myocardium an
evolutionary tradeoff to gain metabolic efficiency? 2) How is the slow turnover of
cardiomyocytes in the adult heart regulated? 3) Does cardiac mechanical load represent
a regenerative block"
10805402,"Summary: Alterations in estrogen signaling contribute to a spectrum of abnormalities ranging
from skeletal dysplasias to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that impact both physiology and behavior.
The CYP19A1 gene encodes aromatase which is the final enzyme in the estrogen biosynthesis
pathway that converts androgens to estrogens. Synthesis of estrogen throughout the body can
be regulated spatially and temporally depending on the tissue. The impact of estrogen extends
beyond stimulation of ER and ER and has recently been shown to regulate the function of G-
protein coupled estrogen receptors in diverse tissues. Moreover, the impact of 17-estradiol (E2)
on stromal and immune cells is important in the regulation of the immune system and
dysfunctional signaling has been linked with auto-immune diseases. Despite the critically
important role of aromatase in biology in tissues and organs ranging from the epithelial tissue to
the brain to bones, many major knowledge gaps remain regarding the regulation of aromatase at
the transcriptional and post-translational level. Recently, our lab made two major discoveries.
First, our recent reports were the first to establish that Dishevelled proteins, key regulators of Wnt
signaling, bind to multiple CYP19A1 tissue specific promoters and modulate aromatase
expression. These recent observations could provide significant insight into mechanisms of
aging-related pathologies. Recent reports establish links between CYP19A1 gene alterations and
AD and show altered neuroendocrinology and steroidogenesis in women with AD. Animal models
further show the importance of aromatase dysregulation in aging related pathologies. Second,
our group was the first to identify novel post-translational modification (PTM) regulatory lysines
that control aromatase enzyme activity. Prior to our report, nothing was known about the extent
to which lysine acetylation modulates aromatase activity. We hypothesize that aromatase PTMs
will be influenced by aging in vivo. We now demonstrate that aromatase PTMs modulate
aromatase inhibitor sensitivity and proposed studies are significant because they will be the first
to dissect newly identified post-translational mechanisms of aromatase control as a function of
aging in mammary gland tissue as a function of age using different transgenic mouse models. We
will also identify novel aromatase PTMs in mammary gland tissue as a function of age via LC-
MS/MS acetylation mapping. These studies represent an exciting new angle since virtually
nothing is known about the role of aromatase PTMs in vivo in mammary gland tissue in general,
and in particular, as a function of age. We further hypothesize that there are novel aromatase
PTMs that are characteristic of the age-linked mammary gland microenvironments."
10799583,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The number of cancer patients and cancer survivors continues to increase while the prevalence of obesity also
continues to increase in the US. Obesity is associated with a greater risk for developing 40% of cancers and
two of the four most prevalent cancers (i.e. breast and colon), are tightly linked with obesity. 5 fluorouracil
(5FU) remains the first line of treatment for colon cancer despite 5FU’s well established toxicities - cytopenia,
mucositis, anorexia, weakness, and fatigue. These toxicities contribute to reduction in relative dose intensity,
increase patient susceptibility to infection, and lead to debilitating functional impairments that not only burden
the patient, but also the patient’s support system. Given the increased prevalence of obesity in the US, it is
increasingly more likely that those needing to undergo anti-cancer treatment will be obese. While it is common
practice to apply a dosing cap, the current recommendations for the treatment of obese cancer patients are to
give full body surface area dosing regimens, despite some evidence suggesting obese patients have
exacerbated drug toxicities and reduced survival. This evidence is not ubiquitous as certain investigations have
highlighted better prognosis and survival with increasing BMIs. I have discovered that obese mice are unable
to sustain 2-3 cycles of 5FU. This I have attributed to a reduction in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD),
the enzyme responsible for catabolizing 5FU in the liver. This has highlighted the need for mechanistic inquiry
into the impact of obesity on 5FU’s toxicities; my K99/R00 proposal addresses this unmet need and will serve
as a platform to launch my independent career in this domain. The overall goal of my proposed K99/R00 is to:
1) to understand the impact of obesity on 5FU’s anti-cancer efficacy and 5FU’s off-target effects and 2) provide
critical training to facilitate my transition to independence. My central hypothesis is that obesity induced non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) contributes to disrupted 5FU catabolism and increased toxicity through
reduced DPD resulting in reduced functional quality of life and survival. I am proposing a mechanistic aim (1),
an exploratory aim (2), and a treatment/intervention aim (3) to test this hypothesis: in aim 1, I will investigate
the role of DPD in the metabolism and toxicity of 5FU with obesity (K99); in aim 2, I will explore the impact of
5FU on skeletal muscle and immune cell -omics with obesity (R00); and in aim 3, I will examine the utility of
manipulating dietary macronutrients on 5FU’s efficacy and off-target toxicities with obesity (R00). My research
aims are complemented by my four training aims: 1) Obesity Phenotyping and Specialized Diet Formation, 2)
Plasmid Preparation, CRISPR/Cas 9 Utilization, and –omics, 3) Drug Metabolism (5FU metabolite analysis),
and 4) Professional Development and Lab Management. I expect that my findings will provide paradigm
shifting evidence for how obese patients should be dosed and monitored to limit chemotherapy’s off-target
effects. Additionally, the results from these studies will serve as the foundation for a pathway to independence
to continue examining the contributing factors underlying cancer patient life quality and survival."
10886497,"COVID-19 has led to over 350 million reported cases and over 5.6 million resulting deaths globally, and nearly
72 million cases and >900,000 deaths in the US. Highly effective vaccines are now available and are the first
line of defense. However, immunity wanes off over time and breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated
persons have been reported, particularly with the newer variants. In December 2021, two novel oral antiviral
agents, Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r) and Molnupiravir (MPV), were granted Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) by the FDA for treatment of early symptomatic patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at high risk of
progression to severe disease. These authorizations were granted based on limited published data, and critical
questions about their comparative effectiveness, effectiveness in the real-world settings, and effectiveness in
specific high-risk sub-populations remain to be answered. There is an urgent need to understand the real-world
effectiveness of these drugs, especially in the high-risk and vulnerable populations, as well as longer term
clinical outcomes in treated patients. Such knowledge is essential for the patients, providers, payors, and
policymakers, to ensure that they are used only in the appropriate populations and situations based on strong
clinical evidence. To address these critical gaps in knowledge, we propose the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Treatment with NMV/r or MPV will be associated with a significant reduction in COVID-19
related hospitalization and 30-day all-cause mortality in older persons, those with a high comorbidity burden,
and in socially vulnerable persons.
Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that NMV/r and MPV treatment will be associated with a significant reduction in
subsequent hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and outpatient clinic visits over a 1-year period
after recovery. Treatment will also be associated with a lower incidence of acute myocardial infarction, stroke,
decline in renal function, and diabetes, compared with propensity-score matched untreated persons.
We will use the Department of Veterans Affairs’ COVID-19 Shared Data Resource (VA ORDCOVID) which
contains extensive demographic, clinical, pharmacologic, laboratory, vital signs and clinical outcomes
information derived from multiple validated sources. We will compare those treated with NMV/r or MPV with
propensity-score matched untreated controls, matched on demographics, clinical variables, severity of
presenting illness, geographic location, time of treatment, vaccination status, time from completion of a full
course of vaccination, and booster dose administration. The PI, Dr. Butt has extensive experience in creating
and analysing large national databases and has published 45 papers on COVID-19 in journals including the
New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA Internal Medicine, Journal of Clinical
Investigation, Nature Medicine, and others. He already has IRB approval to study the epidemiology, natural
history, and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the VA population."
10734074,"ABSTRACT
Plasmodium vivax has not traditionally been considered in malaria elimination strategies across Africa, due to
the assumption that its transmission cannot be supported in the predominantly Duffy-negative population.
Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that P.vivax is present across the continent and Duffy-negative
individuals can contribute to onward transmission. Data from other elimination settings in Southeast Asia show
that P.vivax becomes more prominent as P.falciparum (the dominant malaria species in Africa) declines. This
poses a major threat to malaria elimination in Africa, particularly since surveillance and control strategies
across the continent are almost exclusively focused on P.falciparum. Mobile pastoralist communities in
northwestern Kenya may be especially susceptible to P.vivax infection due to their proximity to and seasonal
contact with neighboring Ethiopia, where both P.vivax and Duffy-positive populations are present. They have
been moving to and from Ethiopia with their herds for hundreds of years, thus it is possible that 1) these
northwestern Kenyan communities harbor higher levels of Duffy antigen than most Kenyan populations and 2)
their regular movements represent opportunities for importing P.vivax. Therefore, the pastoralist communities
in northwestern Kenya represent a high-value surveillance population for monitoring and mitigating the threat
of P.vivax transmission in the region. However, they remain largely outside of routine public health activities
due to their isolated and remote nature, and little is known about their health status or malaria risk. We propose
to leverage samples and data from a recently completed study in nomadic pastoralists in order to quantify the
threat of P.vivax in this specific group and in the region more broadly. The parent study confirmed elevated risk
of P.falciparum infection in those traveling with the herds compared to those who remain in the settlement. In
addition, we have already identified several P.vivax infections, but the extent and relationship to Duffy antigen
are still unknown. In the proposed work, we will first screen >1500 samples for P.vivax infection and describe
the prevalence of P.vivax for the first time in this unique population. Then, we will work with Community Health
Workers to obtain permission to test participant samples for expression of the Duffy receptor. This new
information, coupled with the rich data associated with each sample, will allow us to assess the risk of
emerging P.vivax in this group, determine the value of enhanced surveillance and targeted control, and
recommend criteria for identifying critical surveillance populations as Kenya moves towards malaria
elimination. The findings from this study would have broad application, informing malaria surveillance and
control strategies in Turkana, Kenya, and areas across SSA where P.vivax may have an increasing impact as
P.falciparum is controlled."
10753564,"It is well-known that African Americans (AAs) face a higher risk and burden of colorectal
cancer (CRC), but which genetic pathways or environmental/social determinants add to the risk
of colorectal cancer are not well-known. Our overall working hypothesis is that the archaea in
the human gut lumen are different in AAs compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and this
difference (either in the numbers of archaea, types and/or function) contributes to the racial
disparities observed in CRC. With this hypothesis, the study will use an existing sample set of
AAs and NHWs with and without polyps. The first aim will determine M.Smithii and other
archaea in AAs with and without polyps vs. NHWs with and without polyps using qPCR,
amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. The second aim will examine genomic differences of
M.smithii isolates from fecal samples of AAs with and without polyps vs NHWs with and without
polyps. This will be the first study to examine archaea in the gut microbiome of AAs; and look at
archaea diversity and functional potential in AAs with and without polyps and appropriate NHW
controls, to understand CRC disparities in AAs. If differences are found similar to our preliminary
data, manipulation of the archaea in AAs at risk for CRC can be considered, after further studies
in larger cohorts."
10794241,"Project Summary
The CNS mechanisms underlying motivational deficits in patients with schizophrenia are poorly understood.
These deficits significantly contribute to negative symptoms, which are strongly related to poor functional
outcomes and nonresponse to antipsychotic therapies. Data from our group and others have shown that
increased peripheral inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), are associated with
motivational deficits and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Regarding the mechanisms
involved, our data indicate that in patients with schizophrenia, TNF is associated with decreased activation in
ventral striatum in response to reward anticipation as well as increased activation in anterior insula in response
to increasing perceived effort. These data are consistent with previous results from individuals administered
inflammatory stimuli and from patients with depression that indicate that inflammation targets ventral striatum
and anterior insula to lead to downstream changes in reward processing and motivation-related behaviors.
Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that inflammation plays a role in motivational deficits and
negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia through effects on the ventral striatum and anterior insula.
Nevertheless, the cause and effect nature of this relationship remains unclear. Work from our group and others
suggest that reducing inflammation with the TNF antagonist infliximab improves motivated-related behaviors in
patients with depression and high inflammation, and our preliminary data indicate that infliximab improves
effort-based motivation in depression through effects on ventral striatum. However, previous studies of anti-
inflammatories, including cytokine antagonists, in patients with schizophrenia have been limited by a lack of
specificity for patients with increased inflammation and a lack of focus on inflammation-related behavioral
changes (e.g. amotivation). Herein, we propose a mechanistic clinical trial in which patients with schizophrenia
with high inflammation and motivational deficits will be randomized to an anti-inflammatory challenge with
infliximab or placebo. We will then test the hypothesis that infliximab (vs placebo) will increase ventral striatal
activation in response to reward anticipation and decrease activation of the anterior insula in response to
increasing effort using fMRI. In addition, we will assess the response of objective and clinical measures of
motivation. Thus, the goals of the proposed research are to use a biomarker-driven approach to determine
whether inhibition of TNF with infliximab (compared to placebo) increases activation of the ventral striatum and
decreases activation of the anterior insula during an effort-based reward task (Aim 1), while improving
objective and clinical measures of motivation (Aim 2) and exploring infliximab’s effects on other brain regions
and behaviors to address specificity (Aim 3). In sum, this study will reveal CNS mechanisms of amotivation in
schizophrenia and provide biomarkers and targets that will focus future research and support development of
precision therapies for amotivation and ultimately negative symptoms in relevant schizophrenia subgroups."
10813016,"Project Summary:
The fetal to adult hemoglobin switching around birth involves an expression shift from γ-globin to β-globin in
erythroid cells. Effective re-expression of fetal γ-globin can ameliorate sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia.
Hence, identification of inducers of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an active area of research and holds immense
therapeutic potential. Unlike the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, post-transcriptional regulation of β-
globin switching is poorly understood, with few reports on its physiological and clinical relevance. Our preliminary
studies have identified Pumilo-1 (PUM1), an RNA binding protein with no previously reported functions in
erythropoiesis, as a post-transcriptional regulator of β-globin switching. PUM1, whose expression is regulated
by the erythroid master transcription factor, Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1), peaks during erythroid
differentiation, binds fetal γ-globin mRNA, and reduces γ-globin (HBG1) mRNA stability and translational
efficiency, which culminates in reduced γ-globin protein levels. Knockdown of PUM1 leads to a robust increase
in fetal γ-globin (~22% HbF of total hemoglobin), without affecting adult β-globin levels in human erythroid cells.
Importantly, knocking down PUM1 does not limit erythropoiesis progression, providing a potentially safe and
effective treatment strategy in sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia. In support of this idea, we report elevated
fetal hemoglobin levels in the absence of anemia, in an individual with a novel heterozygous PUM1 mutation in
the RNA binding domain (p.(His1090Profs*16); c.3267_3270delTCAC), suggesting that PUM1 mediated post-
transcriptional regulation is a critical player during human hemoglobin switching. Based on these preliminary
results, we hypothesize that impairing the RNA binding functions of PUM1 in human adult erythroid cells can
induce fetal hemoglobin levels, without deleterious effects on other aspects of erythropoiesis; this induction could
ameliorate the disease phenotypes such as sickling in cultured sickle cell anemia erythroid cells. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Decipher the regulatory elements that enable PUM1 mediated
fetal hemoglobin silencing in human erythroid cells, 2) Study the impact of PUM1 knockdown on human erythroid
differentiation, 3) Evaluate the capacity of PUM1 knockdown to relieve sickling in sickle cell anemia erythroid
cells.
Our studies will for the first time describe the post-transcriptional functions of PUM1 in hemoglobin switching and
erythropoiesis and reveal the impact of a novel human PUM1 mutation p.(His1090Profs*16), which we have
identified in a patient with elevated HbF. Further, these studies will advance our mechanistic understanding of
the post-transcriptional silencing of human fetal hemoglobin, which is poorly understood. Finally, since PUM1
functions as a cytoplasmic post-transcriptional regulator, our studies will determine if disrupting PUM1 to induce
fetal hemoglobin could serve as a potential non-gene altering therapeutic target towards ameliorating β-
thalassemia and sickle cell anemia."
10770534,"Project Summary
The endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays a key role in regulating synaptic function in the brain. Dysfunction of
eCB signaling contributes to numerous psychiatric and neurological disorders including anxiety, depression, and
autism. Consequently, the development of treatments for disorders involving eCB dysfunction requires a
thorough understanding of the mechanisms regulating eCB signaling in the brain. It is well-established that
physiological and/or pathological activation of postsynaptic neurons leads to the biosynthesis and release of the
eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Once released, 2-AG traverses the synaptic cleft and activates cannabinoid
receptors located on presynaptic axon terminals, which mediate its behavioral and physiological effects.
Although considerable progress has been made in elucidating how 2-AG signaling controls synaptic function and
behavioral outputs, the mechanism(s) governing synaptic 2-AG transport remains unknown, highlighting a major
gap in our fundamental understanding of 2-AG signaling in the brain. The lipophilic nature of 2-AG limits its
diffusion across the synapse, suggesting the existence of a carrier(s) that facilitates 2-AG transport to permit
cannabinoid receptor activation. Identification of a synaptic 2-AG carrier would not only greatly enhance our
basic understanding of 2-AG signaling but could also lead to the discovery of a new therapeutic target(s) to treat
disorders involving eCB dysfunction. To that end, our group has recently identified fatty acid binding proteins
(FABPs) as intracellular carriers for eCBs. In this application, we will build upon this progress and test the novel
hypothesis that FABP5, secreted by astrocytes, functions as a synaptic carrier that is essential for 2-AG signaling
in multiple brain areas. In Aim 1, we will employ complementary pharmacological and genetic approaches to test
the hypothesis that FABP5 mediates retrograde 2-AG transport at inhibitory and excitatory synapses in the
hippocampus and ventral tegmental area, brain areas involved in cognitive and emotional regulation. In Aim 2,
we will employ our novel FABP5Flox/Flox mice to delineate the roles of astrocytic and neuronal FABP5 in controlling
synaptic 2-AG transport. Aim 3 will characterize the contributions of intracellular and secreted FABP5 in
mediating 2-AG transport at hippocampal and ventral tegmental area synapses. Successful completion of this
proposal will position FABP5 as a synaptic carrier for 2-AG at central synapses, which will greatly enhance our
basic understanding of eCB signaling and may facilitate the development of future therapeutics targeting
disorders involving eCB dysfunction."
10793609,"ABSTRACT
The metastatic spread of cancer cells and recurrence are intimately linked to therapy failure, which remains an
important clinical challenge for patients with metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Two important
factors that regulate TNBC metastasis and recurrence are: (i) the differentiation status of the cancer cells, and
(ii) the functionality of the immune system within the
tumor microenvironment (TME). Both the cancer cells and
the immune cells are highly influenced by the cytokines Oncostatin M (OSM) and Interferon-beta (IFNB). We find
that the actions of OSM and IFNB oppose one another in regulating both cancer cell differentiation and immune
system function within the TME. OSM and its receptor (OSMR) are frequently upregulated in aggressive,
metastatic and therapy-resistant recurrent cancers, such as TNBC. Mechanistically, OSM/OSMR elicits robust
activation of STAT3, which forms a transcriptional complex with SMAD3, and induces stem-like/mesenchymal
programs that enhance TNBC aggressiveness and resistance to chemo- and immuno-therapy. Moreover, the
cooperation of STAT3 and SMAD3 on co-dependent gene promoters produces a pro-inflammatory, tumor-
promoting TME by suppressing the production of immune-activating IFNB and inducing immune-inhibitory
cytokines. Restoring IFNB signaling prevents and reverses stem-like/mesenchymal programming stimulated by
OSMR and STAT3/SMAD3. Thus, the cooperation between STAT3 and SMAD3 to inactivate IFNB :STAT1/2
signaling axis represents a key step in metastatic progression and tumor recurrence. Based on these and other
compelling findings, we will test the hypothesis that the relative balance between OSM:STAT3/SMAD3 and
IFNB :STAT1/2 signaling in both TNBC cells and immune cells dictates metastatic relapse and ultimately, patient
outcomes. We’ll test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will determine how IFNB suppresses OSMR-
mediated STAT3/SMAD3 co-dependent gene expression; Aim 2 will define how OSMR/ERK signaling activates
STAT3/SMAD3 to drive stem-like/mesenchymal reprogramming and the suppression of IFNB/ISGs. Together,
the results from our studies will provide a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which OSM
and IFNB antagonize one another and test novel therapeutic approaches to shift the balance towards active
IFNB :STAT1/2 and away from OSMR:STAT3/SMAD3 in both TNBC and immune cells, with the goal of improving
outcomes for patients with metastatic TNBC."
10818500,"Each year, approximately 6 million children receive anesthesia in the United States alone. The ongoing opioid epidemic has forced the medical community to examine how it uses opioids for pain management. There is now evidence that early life exposure to opioids is associated with greater sensitivity to pain, adverse long-term effects on physiology, cognition, motors skills and behavior, higher opioid requirements for pain control, and higher risk of persistent opioid use. Accordingly, opioid-sparing anesthetic and analgesic regimens are being investigated intensely. For infants in particular, spinal anesthetics are able to provide analgesia without opioids while further inducing a sedated brain state, unlike adults who require co-administration of traditional sedative-hypnotic agents to blunt awareness. The neurological basis underlying this clinical observation is not fully understood and we have begun to collect pilot data to help further clarify these properties. My mentorship team and I are now well-positioned in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application to rigorously and reproducibly investigate the acute effects of early opioid exposure in the brain and its potential long-term impact on development, with comparison to opioid-sparing spinal anesthesia. I began assembling an anesthesia electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset beginning in 2016 - with a sample size to date now consisting of 143 subjects with a median age of 7 months that continues to grow. Our preliminary data demonstrate that a hallmark of spinal anesthesia appears to be the sleep spindle complex, which resembles normal physiologic sleep that is distinct from general anesthetic (GA) effects that employ opioids. I have a unique opportunity to address critical gaps in knowledge of the effects of early anesthesia on the brain with additional K23-support to continue the subject recruitment and mentored research training activities necessary to analyze the entire EEG dataset. This work, which we have already demonstrated is feasible, will further contribute to fundamental discovery of the analgesic-behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of opioids vs. opioid-sparing alternatives, with the following aims: (1) prospective quantification of analgesic-behavioral and neurophysiological correlates of infant spinal anesthesia in 100 subjects, (2) comparison of neurophysiological properties of infants receiving spinal anesthesia compared to 100 infants of similar age in normal physiologic sleep and 200 infants undergoing similar surgeries receiving general anesthesia, and (3) comparison of clinical and behavioral outcomes between infants undergoing similar surgeries under spinal (n=100) versus general anesthesia (n=200). The research environment at Montefiore Einstein is exceptional and my team of mentors has the expertise to guide me in rigorous assessments of early anesthetic effects on the brain. My training plan is specifically designed to develop my skills in clinical study design, data science, developmental neuroscience, and neural data analysis. By the completion of the career development award, I will have successfully applied for R01-level funding and will be ready to transition to a fully independent clinician-investigator dedicated to improving anesthesia care in children."

 This is a K23 application for Dr. Dustin Hammers, Associate Professor and neuropsychologist at Indiana
University pursuing patient-oriented clinical research on lifestyle interventions in Early-Onset Alzheimer’s
Disease (EOAD). This K23 will provide him the means to strategically transition from clinician to independent
investigator through targeted coursework, didactics and workshops, and career products. The candidate’s
supportive and successful institutional environment ensures that the formal career development plan will add to
his existing expertise in neurodegenerative disease. His long-term career goal is to become an independent
clinician-scientist with an externally funded research program that will enhance behavioral treatment options for
patients with EOAD. Despite expansion of research on interventions for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), treatment
for patients diagnosed at a younger stage of life has been overlooked, due to the rareness of the condition and
challenges identifying disease modifying treatments in traditional-onset AD. These patients experience a
unique set of complications related to personal and occupational functioning, including cognitive declines while
raising families and performing at the height of their careers. Identification of successful treatments for this
condition would lead to significant improvements for patients and their families across multiple aspects of life.
 The purpose of this 5-year research plan is to collect preliminary data through an NIH-defined Stage IB
(NIH Stage Model) study to investigate the feasibility and pilot testing of a lifestyle intervention on short-term
and long-term cognition, functioning, and mood in participants with EOAD. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the
feasibility of a lifestyle intervention combining cognitive training and Tai Chi in participants with EOAD, testing
the hypotheses that the experimental and active control groups will have comparable attrition rates, and that
the combined intervention will be well-tolerated. Specific Aim 2 will investigate if this intervention improves
cognitive, functional, and mood outcomes in participants with EOAD compared to an active control condition. It
is hypothesized that participants undergoing intervention will perform better on outcomes compared to control
participants both post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up. Specific Aim 3 will examine if training or clinical
variables moderate benefit from this combined lifestyle intervention. It will explore whether a greater treatment
response will be seen in women with EOAD relative to men, and if better response will be related to increased
hours of training and decreased disease severity. Outcome improvement from this lifestyle intervention would
enhance the personal/occupational functioning of patients with EOAD, have implications for healthcare
practice, policy, and clinical trials, and inform this intervention for all forms of AD. The candidate’s training in
advanced neurodegeneration, AD trial operations, biostatistical approaches, and career development will
complement his research plan, preparing him for future R01 submissions to more formally test this combined
intervention and consider additional aspects of this intervention’s benefit in EOAD (transfer of benefit, etc.)."
10906736,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is an ongoing public health crisis in the United States. Despite the effectiveness of
current medications to treat OUD, there is still a high rate of relapse following detoxification. Thus, there is a
critical need for a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms contributing to opioid taking and
seeking that could lead to novel targets for future OUD treatments. An emerging literature studying the effects
of opioids on human and rodent neural transcriptomes has identified alterations in gene expression in multiple
brain regions. However, these studies are limited by bulk transcriptomic approaches, which prevent assignment
of expression changes to specific neuronal or glial cell types. Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq)
approaches have the potential to address this knowledge gap and identify cell type-specific transcriptomic
alterations that will advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of OUD. A recent snRNAseq study
characterized the effects of an acute experimenter-delivered morphine injection on cell type-specific
transcriptomes in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region that plays a critical role in drug-taking
and -seeking behaviors. Our preliminary studies extended these results by using snRNAseq to perform
differential gene expression analysis in distinct NAc cell populations and subtypes following acute morphine
injection or repeated morphine self-administration. Our exciting results reveal, for the first time, novel cell type-
specific transcriptomic changes in the NAc that are associated with the escalation of voluntary opioid taking. A
logical next step for the field is to determine the effects of sex on single nuclei transcriptomes as well as profile
longitudinal changes in gene expression throughout subsequent abstinence periods. Therefore, one goal of this
proposal is to characterize the sex- and cell type-specific effects of acute morphine exposure and volitional
morphine taking in the rat NAc (Aim 1). One cohort of female Sprague-Dawley rats will receive an intraperitoneal
injection of morphine or saline. A second cohort of female rats will be paired with yoked saline controls and
allowed to self-administer morphine for 10 days, a period in which escalation of opioid taking develops.
snRNAseq will then be used to identify sex-specific and sex-independent cell type-specific differentially
expressed genes in the NAc. To comprehensively profile changes in gene expression throughout abstinence
following morphine self-administration, snRNAseq will be used to analyze sex- and cell type-specific
transcriptomic changes following acute (1 day) and prolonged (10 days) of opioid abstinence. Differentially
expressed genes from each aim will be validated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and RNAscope. This
proposal will advance preclinical OUD research by using a snRNAseq approach to identify sex- and cell type-
specific NAc transcriptome alterations associated with opioid taking and withdrawal thereby identifying novel
therapeutic targets that will help guide the development of new medications to treat OUD."
10792927,"ABSTRACT
Chronic pain is a major public health problem. An estimated 100 million Americans have experienced chronic
pain producing significant economic and social burden. Pharmacological treatments frequently require the use
of opioids resulting in a major epidemic of abuse in the United States. New, non-addicting treatments for pain
are critically needed. Neuromodulation with low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) may provide a non-
pharmacological treatment for chronic pain. The enormous potential of LIFU stems from the ability to focus
ultrasound through the intact skull to a millimeter-sized focal spot size anywhere in the brain. One promising
target to treat chronic pain is the insular cortex. Multiple lines of evidence support the involvement of the insula
in abnormal pain modulation or central sensitization and pain chronicity. Unfortunately, the insula lies deep to
the cortex and contains small discrete sub-regions making non-invasive access difficult. Preliminary data
demonstrates that LIFU can target individual sub-regions of the insula non-invasively to inhibit laser-evoked
potentials as well as reduce subjective report of pain in humans. It is the purpose of this proposal to investigate
the causal influence of LIFU to sub-regions of the insula on brain activity and behavior related to central
sensitization in healthy human volunteers and fibromyalgia patients. This is important as central sensitization is
a shared characteristic of many chronic pain conditions. It is the long-term goal of this project to advance LIFU
as a human pain management tool to enhance the health and reduce suffering in those with chronic pain."

This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Teresa Kimberley, with protected time and
support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior investigators; (2) provide research
training to mentees engaged in patient-oriented communication disorder research; (3) enhance
training in assessing voice production and; (4) advance the translation of Dr. Kimberley's ongoing
research on laryngeal dystonia. Dystonia is a group of devastating neurological movement disorders
that can affect any body region. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment and the
pathophysiology of the disorder remains largely unknown. The most common dystonia affecting the
vocal fold muscles is adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD). People with AdLD suffer from a strangled
voice and speech interruption due to involuntary spasms of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscles. The long-
term goal of this award is to elucidate the pathophysiology of laryngeal dystonia and to develop
sensitive testing and novel interventions to treat the disease. The proposed project builds upon Dr.
Kimberley's cutting-edge work of developing a novel and valid transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
methodology to assess the cortical excitability of the laryngeal motor cortical area. Recent findings have
shown an atypical pattern of brain activation and decreased intracortical inhibition in people with
AdLD. The hypothesis is that a 5-day inhibitory rTMS protocol targeted to the left laryngeal motor
area associated with the TA muscles will increase intracortical inhibition and improve phonatory
function in people with AdLD. Individuals with AdLD will participate in a randomized, double-blinded,
sham-controlled, preliminary trial. The primary tests will include assessments of phonatory function
(Aim 1) and TMS-measured neurophysiology (Aim 2). Factors associated with positive response to the
intervention will also be explored (Aim 3). This project offers a unique opportunity for mentees to train
in clinical and translational research that is at the intersection of corticobulbar neurophysiology, non-
invasive neuromodulation, and clinical assessment of voice disorders. The rich resources at
Massachusetts General Hospital, MGH Institute of Health Professions, and Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital provide an outstanding scientific environment to train the next generation of researchers in
an interdisciplinary approach to communication disorders research. This project has the potential to
positively impact people with AdLD by expanding treatment options, improving quality of life and
reducing healthcare burden for people with this disorder. The knowledge gained from the proposed
study will extend to future research to optimize neuromodulatory interventions, explore rTMS as an
adjunct therapy to current treatments, and to determine if rTMS can be translated to other voice
disorders or types of focal dystonia."
10795846,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of this project is to develop a tumor organoid-based drug screening platform that quantifies
the differential drug responsiveness of tumor clonal heterogeneity to predict a patient’s therapeutic response
prior to treatment selection. Our research is directed at metastatic intestinal peritoneal surface malignancies
(IPSM), with a focus on colon and appendiceal cancers. These cancers are similarly treated and present clinically
with numerous spatially-distinct peritoneal metastases associated with different anatomic structures. The clinical
course of these cancers typically follows a path of chemoresistance, thus, ex vivo models that can identify drug
combinations and sequencing strategies able to mitigate chemoresistance would be of significant clinical value.
Innate and acquired chemoresistance results from genetic alterations that manifest within the tumor’s clonal
architecture and its changing clonal composition. In IPSM, we have observed distinct clonal variants among
spatially distinct lesions within the same patient indicating the potential for differential drug responses among
intrapatient lesions. Our central hypothesis is that a patient’s clinical response to chemotherapy is proportional
to the magnitude of the clonal response exhibited by the patient’s predominating cancer clones, which can be
assessed by chemosensitivity testing and clonality analysis using patient-derived tumor organoids (PTOs)
constructed from intra-patient lesions that reflect the patient’s metastatic clonal diversity. In Aim 1, we will
construct multi-lesion PTOs from a number of IPSM patients to investigate interactions between tumor clonal
fraction and PTO chemosensitivity. We will test the hypothesis that summative measures of chemo resistant and
sensitive clonal fractions will predict patient clinical treatment responses better than simple measures of organoid
cell viability. Furthermore, we will seek to identify genes in IPSM that are frequently mutated in chemo sensitive
and/or resistant clonal fractions across IPSM patients, and characterize candidate gene functions in colon cancer
cell line organoids and mouse xenograft models of colon cancer. In Aim 2, we will seek to extend the reach of
the PTO platform to include evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) which cannot yet be faithfully
modeled in human systems, and that have emerging roles in gastro-intestinal cancers, yet remain unexplored in
IPSM management. We will test the hypothesis that immune-enhanced PTOs (iPTOs) that preserve the patient-
specific homeostatic relationship between cancer cells and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) can be used to model ICI-
induced cancer cell killing by tumor-reactive CTLs as well as to gain insight into tumor clonal alterations that
influence ICI responsiveness. We will use established murine immune-oncology models (CT26 and MC38) to
study tumor-CTL homeostasis in iPTOs, and to confirm ICI-response parity between ex vivo iPTOs and in situ
mouse tumors. We will confirm the involvement of antigen specific CTL-mediated cancer cell killing in ICI-treated
iPTOs. Finally, parallel to Aim 1, we will identify genes that are frequently mutated in ICI sensitive and/or resistant
clonal fractions of IPSM, and characterize their ICI-modulatory functions in immunocompetent mouse models."

This is a competitive renewal application for the Brown University Community and Clinical Research Training
Program, currently funded through NIMH R25MH083620. Our goal is to train the next generation of researchers
to end the HIV epidemic and to conduct research related to reducing racial disparities in HIV outcomes in the
Southern United States. This renewal application is led by Dr. Amy Nunn and Dr. Leandro Mena, who have
worked collaboratively on these topics for over a decade in Mississippi and beyond. This program was initially
funded in 2008 and exceeded its key objectives during the last 11 years; we trained 40 investigators during the
last funding cycle. During the last five years, our fellows attributed 492 peer reviewed articles and 53 successfully
funded grants to this training program. This renewal application continues our focus on racial disparities and
community engaged scholarship, with greater emphasis on ending the epidemic in the South and in jurisdictions
most heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic. This initiative and the mentoring curriculum will align with the
US Plan to End the HIV Epidemic (EtHE). The program will prioritize training investigators from communities
historically underrepresented in the sciences, with emphasis on training investigators from or conducting
practice-oriented research in geographic hotspots of HIV infection, with a focus on the South. This structured
mentoring program will focus on community-engaged scholarship, geographically circumscribed interventions,
reducing racial disparities in HIV infection, partnering with health departments, and delivering proven HIV
prevention and care interventions through novel means in the rural South. The program has the following specific
aims: Specific Aim 1: To train the next generation of researchers in the communities most heavily impacted by
the epidemic in HIV/AIDS research to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions to reduce racial disparities
in HIV prevention and care, including HIV screening, PrEP, and HIV treatment. This training includes formal
coursework, quarterly mentoring workshops, one-on-one mentoring, epidemiological design, and clinical service
delivery experiences in real-world clinical and community settings. Specific Aim 2: To train investigators from
communities enumerated in the EtHE plan, particularly African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos in the South.
These investigators will lead scientific investigation addressing social, structural and behavioral drivers of the
epidemic; lead clinical, epidemiological and implementation research to mitigate HIV/AIDS disparities; and
develop, implement, and evaluate culturally appropriate and geographically circumscribed interventions focused
on the South."

 Glaucoma blinds through degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons in the optic
projection through sensitivity to intraocular pressure (IOP). Many patients continue to lose vision despite efforts
to manage IOP. Thus, an unmet clinical need is a treatment that addresses RGC degeneration directly. Our
long-term goal is to identify new therapeutic targets based on neuronal repair, protection, and restoration. In
the previous grant cycle, we leveraged transgenic mouse strains to discern interplay between RGC dendritic
pruning, axon degeneration, and astrocyte glia. We discovered two novel forms of adaptive remodeling that
boost and preserve RGC signaling and slow progression. With unilateral IOP elevation, metabolic redistribution
transfers metabolites from the unstressed optic nerve to the retina and nerve challenged by IOP elevation
through astrocyte networks. Conditional knock-out of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) uncouples
this network and prevents redistribution. Finally, for individual RGCs exposed to elevated IOP, enhanced
excitability amplifies the light response, even as dendritic complexity diminishes, through reorganization of
voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) in the unmyelinated axon segment. Both phenomena occur early and
are transient, as are their protective effects. Our objective in this competitive renewal is to build upon these
important results to discern how enhanced excitability and metabolic redistribution mechanistically relate to
axonal and dendritic degeneration and whether they can be enhanced to extend RGC survival. As a corollary,
we will test whether the transient nature of both forms of adaptation arises from metabolic and oxidative stress
to the astrocyte network and if boosting resources exogenously reduces this stress and extends visual
function. This hypothesis is supported by new preliminary data showing a dietary metabolite (pyruvate)
increases astrocyte glycogen in the optic nerve and enhances nerve excitation in response to elevated IOP,
suggesting that the two forms of adaptive remodeling may be linked. In our inducible glaucoma models, we will
utilize a cross-disciplinary approach that combines electrophysiological, cellular and in vivo imaging, and
transgenic tools. Aim 1 will determine the dependence of adaptive remodeling on axonopathy and dendritic
pruning. Aim 2 will characterize the interdependence between metabolic redistribution and enhanced
excitability and whether metabolic redistribution through astrocyte networks maps retinotopically to spatial
sectors of intact RGC axon and dendritic function. Finally, Aim 3 will test whether boosting metabolic
resources reduces astrocyte stress, extends adaptive remodeling, and slows progression in mouse and non-
human primate models of glaucoma. Building from results in the prior grant period, our innovative strategy will
elucidate how two novel, intrinsically compensatory adaptive processes utilize metabolic resources to promote
RGC survival in glaucoma. By translating results to our non-human primate model, we will test the therapeutic
value of targeting enhanced excitability and metabolic redistribution as clinical interventions."
10774193,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Breast cancer has the highest incidence of cancer for women in the U.S. and across the world. Despite
advances in technology—from film-screen images to Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) and now to
Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)—the yearly miss rate has remained stubbornly stable, ranging between
10-30% at screening. Technology alone is not reducing errors of omission; we need to understand the specific
challenges faced by the human readers interpreting the images, and the specific errors that they lead to.
 Satisfaction of Search (SOS) refers to the fact that, after having detected a first lesion in a case, the
miss rate for additional lesions in the same case is substantially elevated. This specific type of error has been
shown to account for 30% of misses in the domains of Radiology where it has been studied, including chest
radiography and Computed Tomography. And yet, it has never been studied in the domain of breast cancer.
Thus, there is a critical need to determine how SOS contributes to errors in breast cancer screening.
 In the present project we will determine the rates of occurrence and the underlying causes of SOS in
FFDM and DBT. We have devised a novel method that overcomes limitations of previous methods and that is
optimized for use in FFDM and DBT. Previous approaches to studying SOS involved the photographic addition
of artificial lesions to images, which is not feasible for breast imaging. Instead, we will construct a database of
naturally occurring cases that is structured for studying SOS. This will involve the collection of multiple-lesion
cases and controlled single-lesions cases, where the former are matched with the latter on key diagnostic
dimensions, such as lesion type, lesion size, and breast density. In two main experiments (one with FFDM and
one with DBT), radiologists will read cases from the experimental set, marking the locations and diagnoses for
benign and malignant lesions. Signal-detection analyses over dual- and single-lesion cases will be used to
estimate the rate of SOS. Eye position and pupil diameter will be tracked as participants read each case.
These data will allow us to assess the prevalence of different known causes of SOS: (a) premature
termination, in which search following first lesion detection is less comprehensive compared with single-lesion
control cases; (b) perceptual set, in which, after having detected a first lesion, participants are biased to find
subsequent lesions with similar perceptual features, leading to reduced sensitivity in the detection of
perceptually dissimilar targets; and (c) resource depletion, in which the demands of maintaining information
about a first-detected lesion in memory reduce available perceptual/cognitive resources, thereby reducing the
efficiency of subsequent search. Understanding the rates and underlying causes of SOS in breast cancer
detection will lay the foundation for planned future work to develop training programs and best practices that
mitigate the specific causes of SOS errors and thereby reduce miss rates in breast cancer screening."

 Abstract: Chromatin is the complex of histone proteins, RNA, and DNA that dynamically packages the
genome within each eukaryotic cell. While cell lineage specific transcription factors clearly play a dominant role
in the control of gene expression, the regulation of chromatin accessibility via post-translational modifications
(PTM) of histones is of great current interest as the opportunities for pharmacological intervention in the action
of the associated proteins are significantly better than in the direct perturbation of transcription factors by small
molecules. The molecular details of chromatin regulation are just beginning to be understood and chemical
biology is poised to play a central role in advancing scientific knowledge and assessing therapeutic
opportunities in this field. Specifically, cell penetrant, high-quality chemical probes that modulate the regulation
of chromatin state are of great significance. The advantages of a small molecule driven approach to exploring
chromatin biology are numerous: temporal resolution; mechanistic flexibility; ease of delivery in cells and
potentially, in vivo; and significantly, a chemical probe may provide an immediate transition to a drug discovery
effort, possibly cutting years off the time between target selection and therapeutic intervention. This impact of a
chemical probe results from simultaneously addressing target ‘validation risk’ (the likelihood that
pharmacologic modulation of the target will have a favorable outcome in a disease) and ‘technical risk’ (the
likelihood that a tolerable molecule that modulates the target can be discovered). While probes often lack some
features required in drugs, their discovery diminishes many target validation and technical risks and creates a
cascade of assays, structural and mechanistic information that is enabling to subsequent efforts focused on
drugs. While high-quality probes are challenging to develop, they are achievable within the resources available
to academic programs, and their creation is a fantastic training experience. To maximize the impact of our
probes, we intend to continue our approach of sharing them without creation of intellectual property.
 We have pioneered a target-class probe discovery strategy within the large family of methyl-lysine
(Kme) readers. We have been productive in this area and built momentum for future studies focused on the
allosteric interactions between Kme reader domains, nucleotide binding domains, and the catalytic domains
that regulate chromatin function. During this effort, we have established a network of talented collaborators that
complement our strengths in chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, in vitro assay development, and
biophysics; with strengths in molecular, structural and chromatin biology. Allosteric interactions in chromatin
regulatory complexes are critically important phenomena that create unique opportunities for pharmacologic
intervention. We will focus our future endeavors on this exciting frontier in the Kme reader family."

This application proposes to examine a novel social epigenetic mechanism for racial inequality in lung cancer:
Reducing racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes by decoding neighborhood contextual environment
(RECODE). We will examine the relationships between exposure to violence, inflammatory responses,
smoking and epigenetic changes in protein arginine methyl transferases (PRMT6) that increase the risk of
developing lung cancer. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that smoking induces increased expression of
PRMT6 in the lung epithelium. We also showed that overexpression of PRMT6 triggers spontaneous lung
tumors in mice. Interestingly, we found that PRMT6 is upregulated among black men compared with white
men in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thus we argue that the increased overexpression of PRMT6
among black men may explain a higher rate of lung cancer among black men compared with white men. While
smoking is a key contributing factor for lung cancer, the frequency and amount of cigarette smoking are not
necessarily higher for blacks, which suggests that other factors are responsible for racial disparity in lung
cancer. Disproportionate social stress in black communities may be responsible for a higher rate of lung
cancer among blacks. In particular, individuals living in excessive neighborhood violence are exposed to
chronic stress, which may intensify the epigenetic changes for lung cancer. We hypothesize that exposure to
neighborhood violence is social stress that increases biophysical inflammatory responses, which exacerbate
the path between smoking, PRMT6 overexpression, and lung cancer.
To examine the proposed social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer disparity, first, we will test the
independent effect of smoking and exposure to neighborhood violence, and the interaction of the two risks on
PRMT6 expression using retrospective tissue samples from black and white lung cancer cases (Aim 2).
Second, we will test the effect of exposure to violence on an inflammatory response (hair cortisol) and lung
cancer screening outcomes by conducting a prospective survey and data collection with high-risk black men
(Aim 3). Finally, we will build a multilevel, context-specific lung cancer risk profiles (Aim 1) that take into
account not only individual behavioral risk (smoking), but neighborhood stress (exposure to violence),
physiological inflammatory responses (increased cortisol), and molecular changes (PRMT6 overexpression).
To develop such risk profiles, we utilize a composite population data approach to establish accurate counts of
all individuals within census tracts with sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood risk profiles.
The strength of RECODE is its innovative approach to unveil a social epigenetic mechanism of lung cancer
disparity. RECODE has the potential to transform understanding multilevel risks of lung cancer and improve
the national lung cancer screening guidelines to reflect the social conditions of racial minority communities."

10792641,"ABSTRACT
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most prevalent immune cell in the tumor microenvironment.
TAMs adopt an M2-like phenotype that supports angiogenesis, attenuates anti-cancer immune responses, and
facilitates metastatic dissemination. Studies in humans and experimental animal models support targeting
TAMs for anti-cancer therapy. However, the environmental conditions triggering M2 polarization and molecular
mechanisms mediating this process are poorly understood. This knowledge is required to target TAMs
therapeutically and to identify patients that would benefit from such therapies.
One potential pathway for TAM polarization is via metabolic reprogramming. Previous studies showed that
glycolysis supports a pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor M1 phenotype in macrophages, while mitochondrial
respiration is required for the M2 phenotype. Our recently published work challenged this paradigm. We
showed that treating macrophages with LPS or bacteria (M1 stimuli) induce lactate production which in turn,
promotes a late phase switch to an M2-like phenotype. The mechanism underlying this surprising observation
involves a novel lactate-induced epigenetic modification (H3 lysine lactylation (Kla)) at promoters of genes
associated with the M2-phenotype that directly promotes transcription.
Hypoxic conditions, such as those found in tumors, also induce lactate production by macrophages. In
preliminary work, we show that hypoxia induces expression of M2-like macrophage genes, and these genes
are marked by Kla at their promoters. We further show that TAMs isolated from tumors with high hypoxia have
elevated levels of histone Kla and M2-like proteins in comparison to TAMs tumors with low hypoxia. Finally, we
show that inhibiting endogenous lactate production by TAMs (via myeloid cell specific deletion of Ldha)
attenuates the M2-like phenotype of TAMs, lessens tumor growth, and increases CD8+ effector T cells in
tumors with high hypoxia, but not in tumors with low hypoxia. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that a
lactate-Kla pathway induces the M2-like phenotype of TAMs during hypoxia and promotes tumor growth by
suppressing adaptive immunity.
To test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: (1) determine the contribution of TAM lactate production to its
M2-like phenotype during hypoxia, (2) dissect mechanisms by which lactate production by TAMs promotes
tumorigenesis, and (3) determine the contribution of histone lactyltransferases to histone Kla and M2-like
phenotype and function of macrophages. By integrating human studies with mechanistic animal, cell-based,
epigenetic, and biochemical studies, our proposed work seeks to delineate the mechanisms that promote M2-
like TAMs and their effects on tumor development. Delineating these mechanisms may identify potential
molecular targets for TAM-based therapeutics that improve anti-tumor immunity and reduce tumorigenesis."

Understanding how a network of interconnected neurons receives, stores and processes information requires
parallel and high quality recording of neuroelectric signals. Intracellular recording techniques such as patch
clamp are invasive and limited to recording 1-2 cells. While extracellular multielectrode arrays can record multiple
cells, they are pre-fabricated and thus can only probe fixed locations. Optical detection of electric activities
provides the needed spatial flexibility. Calcium sensors such as GcaMP have a slow time response and not
suitable to record fast-spiking pacemaker neurons such as dopaminergic neurons. Voltage-sensitive
fluorescence proteins and dyes have much faster time response, but their recording time is usually limited by
photobleaching.
In this project, we will demonstrate an orthogonal approach of optical recording. This method, Electrochromic
Optical Recording of Electric potentials (ECORE) makes use of a unique material property – optical absorption
of an electrochromic film depends on applied voltages. We detect the optical reflection of an electrochromic film
to read out cellular electrical activities. The method is truly label-free, i.e. free of any molecular probes that need
to be incorporated into cells and perturb cellular physiology, and not limited by photobleaching or photo-toxicity.
In preliminary work, we have built a sensitive optical setup that is able to detect the reflectivity change of the
electrochromic film in response to electrical potentials as small as 10 microvolts. Indeed, we have used ECORE
to successfully record single-cell action potentials in neurons, cardiomyocytes, and brain tissues. With this
project, we plan to dramatically expand ECORE capabilities by developing a scanning ECORE platform for
parallel detection and an ECORE microscope for subcellular measurement of neuroelectric activities. We will
use ECORE to probe the functional connectivity of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain area. Accomplishment of
this work will result in a new class of electrophysiological tools that can be used by other research groups."
10804737,"Abstract:
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) is one of the most common types of cancers in the US. Due to compromised immunity, solid organ
transplant recipients (SOTRs) are at a much higher risk for NMSC and it often becomes the cause of death in
SOTRs. Prevention of NMSC is an ideal strategy, particularly for immune compromised populations. Rexinoids
are small molecule drugs and are able to prevent skin cancer. However, some of the adverse effects may lead
to non-compliance in their use. We have developed two distinct classes of structures of rexinoids: UAB30 and
UAB20, which are highly selective, non-toxic and orally bioavailable RXR agonists. These agents are also highly
effective in preventing skin cancer as shown in our preliminary data. Both UAB30 and UAB20 do not cause
hyperlipidemia, an effect usually associated with clinically approved rexinoids. Dampening cancer associated
inflammatory biomarkers is also an attractive property of these agents. Thus, our enthusiasm for further
developing highly effective analogs of these agents as cancer chemopreventive agents has prompted us to
submit this proposal. Guided by x-ray crystallography and biophysical studies, we propose to develop novel
analogs of UAB30 & UAB20 with enhanced potency than parent compounds, with suitable pharmacokinetics for
chronic administration and without any overt toxicity. Low energy molecular conformation of UAB30 fit well into
the RXR ligand-binding pocket (LBP). Our strategy is to improve the potency significantly without distorting the
molecular conformations of these two agents. Therefore, we propose to substitute a hydrogen atom with a
halogen and/or a heteroatom. Because of the electronegativity of fluorine and the strength of carbon-fluorine
bond, we have reasoned that strategic introduction of fluorine will improve the potency, oral bioavailability,
metabolic stability and pharmacokinetics of the newly synthesized analogs. Heteroatoms such as nitrogen can
modulate the polarity (logP) value significantly. Therefore, we have proposed to substitute a single carbon of
tetralone ring of the UAB30 with a nitrogen. Individually and collectively, these modifications will significantly
contribute to the potency of UAB30 analogs and will make them ideal agents for pre-clinical evaluation. Similarly,
for UAB20, x-ray crystal structures reveal that a five membered heterocyclic ring is accommodated more
favorably and make interactions within the LBP. Therefore, we have proposed to substitute the phenyl ring with
heterocyclic rings. These modifications will also modulate the logP and improve pharmacokinetics of these new
analogs. Our co-investigator in this application has developed unique murine models of the NMSC, which
recapitulate human pathobiology of the disease both in normal population and in SOTRs. These models will be
employed in the proposed investigations to define the most effective and non-toxic analogs suitable for chronic
administration for NMSC chemoprevention. During this grant period, we expect to develop at least one new
rexinoid ready for clinical development after GLP toxicity evaluation."

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a common complication of anticancer treatments, such
as chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, due to treatment toxicity. In female cancer
survivors POI causes sterility, and loss of the ovarian endocrine function, which in turn results in
premature osteopenia, muscle wasting, and accelerated cardiovascular disease. These long-
lasting effects are significant, particularly for young girls reaching puberty. The long-term goal of
our research is to develop a means to restore ovarian endocrine function in young women with
POI by utilizing allogeneic transplantation of ovarian tissue. We designed an immuno-isolating
capsule based on well-characterized biomaterials and tuned to the unique physiology of ovarian
tissue. Our approach proved to be successful in mice using donor tissue from rodents, yet the
significant differences in ratio between stroma and follicles in human ovarian tissue, size that
human follicles reach at maturity and the balance between dormant and activated follicles
between rodents and humans require further investigation using human ovarian tissue. If
successful, this approach will offer a clinically relevant and unexplored tool to restore ovarian
endocrine function in young women with POI."
10764917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rewarding properties of social interactions are critical to the expression of adaptive social behavior and to
the development and maintenance of social relationships. Little is known, however, about the factors that
determine the reward value of social interactions or about the basic neural mechanisms that underlie social
reward, particularly in females. We do know that the mesolimbic dopamine system (MDS) is central to the
neural circuitry controlling the rewarding properties of many other stimuli such as drugs of abuse. A primary
component of the MDS is dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that project
to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as to other sites such as the medial prefrontal cortex. Critical inputs
to the MDS include oxytocin (OT)-containing projections from the hypothalamus. We and others have
demonstrated that, in male rodents, activation of OT receptors in the caudal VTA and in the NAc is
essential for the rewarding properties of social interaction. Remarkably, despite the considerable
evidence for sex differences in OT regulation of social behaviors, the role of OT in regulating social reward in
females has not been investigated. This project will provide substantial new information on the factors that
determine the reward value of social interactions and on the neural mechanisms that mediate social reward
by testing this series of integrated hypotheses in male and female Syrian hamsters. Based on published
and preliminary data from our lab and others, we have hypothesized that: 1) there is an inverted U
relationship between the “dose” of social interactions and social reward, 2) this dose-response
relationship is initiated at lower doses in females than in males, and 3) this sex difference is mediated
by differential OT-induced DA release in the MDS. This project has substantial potential for translation to
clinically-related problems by providing: 1) new information on how social stimuli can transition from being
rewarding to being less rewarding or even aversive, 2) potential mechanisms for understanding well-known
sex differences in the incidence of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders for which
dysfunctional social relationships are an important symptom, and 3) the potential for development of gender-
specific treatments for these disorders."
10764801,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Bacteria produce an astonishingly diverse array of carbohydrate-based macromolecules that serve
important physiological roles. The lipopolysaccharide or LPS, for example, is a complex glycoconjugate
attached to the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. Conceptually, the LPS can be thought of in
terms of three regions: the lipid A component, the core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen. It is the O-antigen
that displays the most variation from species to species and that, in addition to the lipid A moiety, plays a role
in virulence.
 Likewise, the capsular polysaccharides, which surround both pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria, serve as the first lines of defense against the host immune system. These high molecular
weight polysaccharides function by camouflaging cell surface components that would normally elicit the
immune response. Often the sugars in the capsular polysaccharides are modified by the attachment of a
variety of moieties including an O-methyl phosphoramidate group, which has been shown to be involved in
host invasion and bacteriophage recognition. In addition, some capsular polysaccharides contain nonulosonic
acids, nine-carbon based monosaccharides that have been implicated in virulence.
 The intellectual goals of this MIRA award are threefold: (1) to expand upon our current knowledge of the
structures and activities of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of O-antigen sugars, (2) to provide a
molecular framework for understanding the biosynthesis of the O-methyl phosphoramidate group in
Campylobacter jejuni, and (3) to explore the structures and functions of the enzymes involved in the
biosyntheses of nonulosonic acids from Acinetobacter baumannii, an organism that has been placed into the
“Critical” category by the World Health Organization for the development of new antibiotics.
 Techniques to be utilized include X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic analyses.
Importantly, preliminary data for many of the proposed investigations are already available.
 Our studies have and will continue to inform research into bacterial pathogenicity. Given that the LPS and
capsular polysaccharides play critical roles in bacterial virulence, the enzymes to be investigated may
ultimately serve as targets for antimicrobial drug design."
10808200,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone cancer that mainly affects children and young adults, and is
characterized by high genomic complexity. Current treatment relies on chemotherapy, yet many patients exhibit
resistance or develop metastatic disease. Current experimental models for OS research rely primarily on 2D
monolayer culture or xenograft models. However, 2D cultures culture generally fail to retain tumor phenotypes
and drug response in vivo, whereas mouse models are costly and impractical for high-throughput drug screening.
Recently tissue engineered 3D cancer models have emerged as new cancer research tools, which better
recapitulate in vivo tumor signaling and drug responses than 2D cultures. However, most tissue engineered
cancer models to date are limited to soft tissues. Unlike soft tissues, bone is characterized by a highly-
mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) comprised of 70% minerals such as hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals.
However, the role of bone mineral in driving OS progression and drug response remains largely unknown.
Furthermore, previous OS studies rely on a narrow set of cell lines that have been in culture for decades, which
may no longer reflect the biology and drug response in vivo The overall goal of this proposal is to integrate a
scalable and physiologically relevant 3D OS model with high-dimensional sequencing tools to elucidate OS
genomic heterogeneity and drug resistance, as well as screening novel combination therapies using multiple
patient-derived OS cell lines. Our 3D models is specifically designed with high-throughput screening in mind,
and leverages on a patented microribbon (µRB)-based scaffold invented by the Yang (PI) lab. This multi-PI
application will bring together expertise in biomaterials design and 3D tumor models (Yang lab/Stanford) with
expertise in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines, genomics and preclinical therapeutics of OS (Sweet-
Cordero lab/UCSF). We hypothesize that OS signaling and drug responses in 3D culture can be modulated by
tuning the type and size of mineral cues 3D gelatin µRB scaffolds to better mimic the in vivo phenotype, and
combinational therapies that target identified signaling using 3D OS model will lead to better treatment outcomes
for OS in vivo. To test these hypotheses, we will carry out the following aims. Aim 1: Develop 3D OS models with
optimized niche cues for deep characterization of OS signaling and heterogeneity using multiple OS PDX cell
lines and compare results to mouse orthotopic OS models. AIM 2: To harness 3D OS models to determine the
regulatory pathways involved in mediating receptor tyrosine kinase expression in OS and identify lead drug
candidates by screening a panel of targeted drug therapies. Aim 3: To identify novel combination therapies for
PDX OS cell lines and elucidate potential drug resistance mechanisms using 3D OS models. This study will
pioneer integrating 3D OS model with PDX cell lines and high-dimensional sequencing expertise. The outcomes
would significantly advance the understanding of OS biology and heterogeneity, identifying drug resistance
mechanisms, and accelerate discovery of combination therapies that cannot be achieved using existing tools."

Adequate language input is required for typical language development. However, NICU infants are at particularly
high risk for experiencing a language deprived environment and may spend weeks-to-many-months of a critical
developmental period in this setting. Importantly, we know that the language environment of the NICU matters:
the quantity and quality of language input an infant receives in the NICU has been associated with positive
short-and-long-term outcomes (e.g., attentiveness, alertness, vocalizations, conversational turns, language,
development). Infant directed speech (IDS), is a highly promising language construct, that is defined as a pattern
of speaking adults use with infants and young children that has a simpler phonology, grammatical structure, and
fewer lexical items as well as a higher pitch and unusual intonation pattern. Increased use of IDS has been found
to be predictive of better language outcomes in typically developing infants. Increasing the quantity of IDS in the
NICU may be a simple, low-training, high-impact intervention that could bolster early language outcomes for
NICU infants (e.g., verbalizations, conversational turns). For NICU infants, it is imperative that we task both
parents and clinicians as co-primary providers of routine IDS due to significant existing barriers to parent
visitation. However, tasking clinicians to use IDS during routine care will likely face organizational, innovation,
and clinician-level barriers that may impact clinician intentions. To successfully increase all infants’ access to
IDS, it is necessary to conduct preliminary implementation research prior to a Hybrid Type 1 (effectiveness-
implementation) study to identify and understand: 1) barriers to parent visitation and intentions to use IDS with
their hospitalized infant (with semi-structured interviews, surveys); and 2) identify and understand barriers and
facilitators to NICU clinician use of IDS (with surveys, video-elicitation interviews; video simulation surveys). To
conceptualize this work, we are modifying the Explore Plan Implement Sustain implementation framework to
incorporate health equity factors as part of the outer context and use organizational and psychological theories
of behavior to explore and refine a possible causal model of contributors to parent and clinician intentions to use
IDS with NICU infants. Completing the proposed research will allow us to refine our causal model by identifying
an exhaustive list of societal, organizational, innovation, and individual factors (i.e., barriers, facilitators) that may
impact or moderate parent intentions to visit and parent and clinician intentions to use IDS in the NICU. Finally,
the training and research activities proposed in the K23 application will support the PI in having the data, skills,
and experiences necessary to submit a strong application for a multi-site Hybrid Type I (effectiveness-
implementation) trial that examines 1) whether we can significantly increase adult use of IDS in the NICU (i.e.,
parent/visits, clinician/routine care); and 2) whether infants who received higher levels of IDS demonstrated more
verbalizations, vocalizations, and conversational turns at discharge (adjusting for gestational age)."
10812400,"Brown adipocytes exposed to cold dissipate heat via adaptive thermogenesis. Adaptive thermogenesis is a physiological response that contributes to energy homeostasis and restricts obesity development in rodents and humans. Activation of adaptive thermogenesis by cold exposure depends on sympathetic/beta-adrenergic signals and thyroid hormones (TH) and is induced by glutathione (GSH) depletion via elevation of reactive oxygen species. TH levels in BAT are locally regulated by iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2), while GSH is enzymatically converted into its reduced form by GSH peroxidase 1 (GPX1). Besides their crucial role in the activation of BAT adaptive thermogenesis, both DIO2 and GPX1 are selenoproteins, i.e. a class of proteins containing in their active site selenium (Se) as the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Sec is decomposed by the enzyme Sec lyase (Scly) into H2Se. Sec comes from either dietary sources or selenoprotein degradation. Hence Scly-mediated Sec decomposition triggers a Se recycling process required to maintain optimal levels of selenoproteins, particularly when Se is limiting. Se recycling is key for energy balance, as disruption of the Scly gene in mice (Scly KO) leads to weight gain worsened by Se deficiency. In wild-type rodents, Se deficiency upregulates Scly and decreases BAT Se levels, DIO2 and GPX1 activities. It is unknown if Se recycling modulates BAT Se levels, impacting DIO2 and GPX1 synthesis and activities, ultimately contributing to cold- induced adaptive thermogenesis. Our long-term research goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms through which Se metabolism regulates energy homeostasis. The overall objective of this research proposal is to determine the role of Se and Scly-mediated Se recycling in linking selenoprotein degradation and synthesis with adaptive thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. In Aim 1, we will determine if dietary Se intake regulates Se metabolism, especially Scly-mediated Se recycling, impacting responses to cold exposure in BAT. In Aim 2, we will determine if Scly is required for cold-induced adaptive thermogenesis in BAT. In Aim 3, we will determine if Scly participates in selenoprotein degradation in brown adipocytes. By studying both Se intake and metabolism, especially Se recycling, using novel in vitro and in vivo models, this conceptually and technically innovative project will clarify the modulatory effect of dietary Se on brown adipocyte physiology, providing new insights into the mechanistic role of Scly in the control of energy expenditure in mammals."
10748413,"Project summary
Thermoregulation is a fundamental process that affects virtually all aspects of animal physiology.
In mammals, core body temperature is monitored by neurons in the preoptic area of the
hypothalamus. Activity of these neurons determines the neuronal output that drives
thermoregulation and controls body temperature. Despite its fundamental physiological
significance, the molecular basis of temperature homeostasis under normal, adaptive and
pathological conditions remains obscure. Mammalian hibernation is a cyclical reprograming of a
thermoregulatory phenotype. This process is associated with dramatic physiological
perturbations: heart and respiration rate decrease, core body temperature drops from 37°C to 2-
4°C. Upon arousal from hibernation, all physiological parameters return to normal within hours.
This remarkable plasticity suggests the presence of specific adaptations in the thermoregulatory
system of hibernators, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic.
In this basic scientific proposal, we will employ a comparative multidisciplinary approach to
understand cellular and molecular principles of reversible hypothermia at the level of POA, using
a novel hypothermia-tolerant animal model, hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel, and
laboratory mice, a non-hibernating species. Understanding how hibernators achieve reversible
hypothermia will facilitate the development of pharmacology to induce and regulate hypothermia
in mammals."

ethnic, and socio-economic extractions. Its scientific themes are: (i) Integrated physiology of insulin action
and resistance; (ii) Diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart disease; (iii) Pancreas development, beta cell function,
and cellular replacement therapies; (iv) Genetics and immunology of Type 1 Diabetes; (v) Global health, health
disparities, and underserved urban populations. The Biomedical Research Base is comprised of 78 NIH-
funded investigators at Columbia, and 4 associate members at sister institutions in New York City. Total
research funding exceeds $ 81M in annual direct costs, including 91 investigator-initiated NIH grants
directly related to diabetes totaling nearly $56M in annual direct costs. Of these, NIDDK funds 64
projects totaling $18M in annual direct costs. The DRC supports four technical Core Facilities:
Translational Biomarker Analytical Core (TBAC); Advanced Tissue Pathology Imaging Core (ATPIC); Mouse
Metabolic Function & Phenotyping Core (MMFPC); Cytometry & Cell Sorting Core (CCSC). These facilities
have been used to capacity by 66 investigators funded by 102 grants and have supported the award of
45 new grants during the current cycle. Additionally, the DRC provides $250K annually for investigators
through a Pilot & Feasibility Grant Program (PF). During the current cycle, this program supported 13
awardees selected from 90 Letters of Inquiry and 51 complete applications. The 11 recipients of completed PF
awards have applied for 12 new grants and obtained 7, 6 of which are funded by NIH, totaling ~$ 2.8M in
annual direct costs. 11 of 13 funded investigators remain active in diabetes research. The DRC supports a
successful Enrichment Program to increase awareness of diabetes research in the local scientific/academic
and promote regional, national, and international collaborations. The Administrative Core provides logistical
support and programmatic leadership, financial oversight and integration of research efforts, core facilities, and
PF administration. During the current funding cycle, the DRC has endeavored to advance NIDDK’s mission by:
(i) supporting original, innovative and high impact research by its members; (ii) raising awareness of and
interest in clinical and basic diabetes research; (iii) enhancing training and other diabetes-related educational

facilitate information exchange; (vii) providing impetus and resources to translate basic science discoveries into
clinical care and community initiatives to improve the health of people with diabetes; and (viii) leveraging local
and national philanthropic and diabetes advocacy resources."
10813089,"The Administrative Core is responsible for allocation, management, and oversight of DRC resources. The
Administrative Core, in coordination with the DRC Executive Committee and the two Advisory Committees
(Internal and External) establishes and implements program objectives and Core utilization targets, reviews
and approves membership applications, organizes the research base into coherent interest groups and
facilitates communication among them, oversees program enrichment activities, and administers the Pilot &
Feasibility (PF) and Enrichment Programs. The Core is responsible for allocation of resources among different
Cores based on workflows, user base, technical, and strategic considerations. It is also responsible for
administrative oversight of personnel actions, financial management and reporting, conforming to university
standards for space and resource utilization, supporting best practices for rigor and reproducibility in research,
and providing appropriate human resource management to Core Directors to implement billing and expedite
technical support and personnel actions. The Core is also responsible for development, maintenance, and
timely update of the DRC website. The Core ensures continuity of operations in the event of replacement of
Core leadership or technical personnel, and oversees compliance with university regulations regarding human
subjects, animal experimentation, technology transfer, hazardous and radioactive material compliance. The
Administrative Core leadership represents the DRC within the faculty of the Vagelos College of Physician &
Surgeons and is responsible to ensure that the DRC figures prominently in the school’s strategic and
programmatic goals. Dr. Domenico Accili, MD will serve as Director of the Administrative Core. In this capacity,
he will oversee DRC activities, including DRC membership, administration of Core Facilities and PF program,
convene the Advisory Boards and attend yearly meetings of the DRC PIs. He will be assisted by Dr. Rudolph
Leibel, DRC Co-PI, and Director for the Pilot & Feasibility Program. Together, the Co-PIs will integrate DRC
activities with institutional Centers and initiatives that can benefit diabetes research and training. They will
ensure the seamless operation of DRC Core facilities and their integration with university-wide facilities
(including the NY Obesity Research Center) to avoid duplication of costs and effort. In a similar vein, the Co-
PIs will proactively integrate DRC activities with those of other DRCs, especially the neighboring Northeast

10813091,"Rodent models of diabetes and its complications provide fundamental insights into the molecular basis of
human disease. The investigators of the Columbia Diabetes Research Center (DRC) employ more than one
hundred murine models to study the development, pathology and complications of diabetes and related
disorders. Modern tools to study diabetes in rodents and experimental manipulation of mice often requires
expensive equipment and technical skills that are beyond the means of individual investigators. The Mouse
Metabolic Function & Phenotyping Core (MMFPC) provides efficient, cost-effective, and timely services to DRC
investigators that enables researchers to carry out experiments that otherwise would be beyond their ability.
The MMFPC has been in great demand during the current funding cycle and has evolved significantly since the
last submission to meet the changing needs of DRC investigators. The MMFPC has proven broadly successful
in achieving its mission of assisting individual investigators in characterizing metabolic phenotypes of mice.
The MMFPC currently provides four broad services that facilitate the efficient characterization of mouse
models of diabetes and its complications: (i) Body Composition Analysis, (ii) Whole Body Metabolic
Assessment, (iii) Metabolic Clamps, and (iv) Metabolic Procedures & Surgeries. A service to isolate and
characterize extracellular vesicles is being implemented with a tentative start date of July 2022. The MMFPC
services complement those provided by other DRC Cores, so that investigators who take advantage of DRC
resources can fully characterize the histologic, immunologic, and metabolic function and phenotype of mice.
The Core has been built through the strong support of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and Columbia
University. In response to investigator surveys and since our last competing renewal, we now provide a suite of
surgical procedures that will facilitate studies of the development and pathophysiology of diabetes. Projections
indicate that demand for Core services will remain high as we strengthen and grow our research base."
10813095,"The Translational Biomarker Analytical Core (TBAC) Laboratory makes available to DRC
investigators analytical techniques to support studies of diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance,
intermediary metabolism, and medical consequences of diabetes in human subjects and animal
models. The services provided are best based in a Core Laboratory because they require investigator
consultation, special instrumentation and methods that are difficult or impracticable to establish in
individual laboratories. In addition, this arrangement allows for coordinated attention to reliability and
reproducibility of the assays employed. In investigations of glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion,
insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hormone action, molecular genetics, or drug effects, it is essential to
be able to monitor hormones such as insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, GIP, PYY, cortisol and
catecholamines and such metabolites as glucose, FFA, glycerol, ketones, amino acids, lipids, as well
as more detailed assessment of the metabolomics fingerprint. With the increasing technical
capabilities to develop and validate novel disease biomarkers, one of the key functions of the Core is
to expeditiously develop and inaugurate these new methods so that the research base can avail itself
of these assays. The SPECIFIC AIMS of the TBAC are: 1) To meet the high demand for a dynamic
range of bioassays by the research base, enhancing efficiency, quality, and reproducibility, while
minimizing costs. 2) To respond to members’ needs by supporting the development of new assays
and methods that leverage the expertise of the Core staff. 3) To facilitate access to targeted and
untargeted metabolomics/lipidomics determinations by the Columbia Irving Biomarker Laboratory and
the newly expanded Metabolomics core. 4) To facilitate access to experts in bioinformatics, kinetic
studies and pathway analyses required to appropriately interpret metabolomics/lipidomics
determinations and stable isotopes kinetic studies. 5) To provide expert advice to investigators and
their associates on analytical methods, experimental design, and data interpretation for state-of-the art
phenotyping of diabetes. 6) To train junior investigators and post-doctoral fellows in practical skills in
the Core methods and, if appropriate, transfer analytical methods to their own labs.7) To facilitate
collaborations among the research base, advertise available resources, and develop and/or facilitate
investigator access to new technologies, such as MS-based methods to analyze and quantify
metabolites. TBAC analytic and consultative capabilities are closely articulated with the other DRC
Cores to provide an integrated approach to quantitative metabolic analyses."
10813099,"Flow cytometry is an important tool to quantify and phenotype cells that define pathways relevant to diabetes.
Previously limited to the analysis of circulating immune cells, advances in cell extraction from tissues has
allowed flow cytometry to expand its capabilities to the study of developmental, metabolic and signaling
programs in a wide variety of cell types. The Cytometry & Cell Sorting Core (CCSC) is a vital component of the
Columbia University Diabetes Research Center (DRC), as it addresses the research needs of many DRC
investigators who study immunological, developmental, and metabolic aspects of diabetes. The Core was
created in 2010 in partnership with the Columbia Center for Translational Immunology and the Department of
Medicine, with substantial University investment as well as NIH support (S10 and P30 grants) and expanded in
2017 by incorporating the Cancer Center’s flow cytometry core. The core expansion from 5 to 11 instruments
(4 coming from the Cancer Center and 2 new spectral flow cytometers) has provided greater choice and
flexibility for DRC members. We expect DRC member usage of the core to remain steady and strong, given
attractive new technologies afforded by spectral flow cytometry. CCSC will assist investigators in two ways:
Aim 1 – To quantify and phenotypically characterize cell populations that contribute to the metabolic,
immunological, and developmental programs of diabetes and its complications. CCSC will leverage advanced
technologies in fluorescent imaging at the single cell resolution to support the analysis of different cell types in
human and animal tissues, including humanized mouse models of Type 1 diabetes. Aim 2 – To purify
populations of cells of relevance to diabetes and its complications. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting,
the CCSC will support DRC investigators to purify individual populations of cells for culture, in vivo
implantation, or molecular characterization including genetic and transcriptional profiling, protein purification
and signaling studies, and for functional analysis including T cell activation, proliferation, and migration studies.
To achieve these aims, the CCSC has established standard operating procedures to: (i) assure quality control
and reproducibility; (ii) prioritize investigator use; (iii) monitor Core usage; and (iv) adapt to new technologies
and to the needs of the Columbia Research Base."
10813105,"ABSTRACT
Visualizing and quantifying tissue and cellular pathologies are central to understanding the pathogenesis,
progression, and complications of metabolic disease, and to monitor the effectiveness of its treatment.
Methods of labeling, imaging, and quantifying cellular elements have improved rapidly and are providing new
capabilities to evaluate phenotypes at the sub-cellular, cellular, and whole-organ levels. The Advanced Tissue
Pathology and Imaging Core (ATPI) has been in great demand during the current funding cycle and has
evolved significantly since the last submission to meet the changing needs of DRC investigators.
The ATPI has proven broadly successful in achieving its mission of assisting individual investigators in
histophenotyping. Originally conceived and organized as a histology core and subsequently expanded to
include microscopy, the ATPI continues to evolve to meet the everchanging needs of DRC investigators. It was
successfully reorganized and expanded during the current funding period to include state-of-the-art clearing,
molecular “staining” and imaging technologies. To meet the large and growing demands for these services
identified in investigator surveys and recommended by reviewers in the previous funding cycle, we streamlined
the administrative components of the ATPI by creating an on-line service request system and increased efforts
to provide the heaviest users with the access to equipment and training needed to perform many of the
techniques for themselves. An expert in the implementation of these advanced techniques in both the brain
and peripheral organs, Dr. Lori Zeltser has led the restructuring of the Core. The ATPI services complement
those provided by other DRC Cores, so that investigators who take advantage of DRC resources can fully
characterize the histologic, immunologic, and metabolic function and phenotypes of mice. Thus, the combined
investments by Columbia, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center and the DRC have been leveraged to provide
excellent services at low costs."
10813116,"The Columbia DRC Pilot & Feasibility (PF) program provides support for research projects related to diabetes.
Since its inception, the PF program has successfully attracted new investigators who wish to undertake a
career in diabetes, as well as established investigators proposing to work on diabetes, outside of their usual
area of research. The program has funded at least two new grants every year. During the past cycle, we
awarded 13 PF grants, at an average annual award of $ 50,000. The 13 PF awardees were selected from 90
Letters of Inquiry based upon preliminary review by the PF Director and the PI. 51 complete applications
were solicited and reviewed by extramural scientists selected for their relevant expertise. Each project
is provisionally funded for two years, contingent upon submission by the PI of a one-year interim report
demonstrating suitable progress. Nine PIs met the NIH criteria for new investigators, four were established
investigators who undertook projects in the diabetes field and were new to diabetes research. We report
outcome data on 11 projects (three additional projects are in their second year of funding and two are
presented with this application for initial funding). The 11 recipients of completed PF awards have applied
for 12 new grants and obtained 7, 6 of which are funded by NIH and one by industry. The annual
amount of direct costs derived from PF grant-catalyzed awards in this cycle is near $ 2.8M. 11 of 13
funded investigators remain active in diabetes research. The PF program also continues a successful
match program through the Berrie Foundation program “Frontiers in Diabetes Research” that has
enabled us to fund one additional PF grant each year. We have also integrated the DRC PF activities with
those of the New York Obesity Research Center, so that applicants are routinely encouraged, where
appropriate, to apply to both programs, increasing the opportunity for possible funding of their application.
Three types of applications are considered: i, Proposals from new investigators who have not held any prior
funding, to carry out preliminary studies leading to an NIH, ADA or JDRF grant application; ii, Proposals for
technology development in the field of diabetes; iii, Proposals from established investigators, without prior
funding in diabetes, who wish to undertake a diabetes-related project. Under the leadership of Dr. Leibel,
Associate Director for PF programs, the program administration solicits applications from the academic
community, ensures prompt peer-review, oversees grant administration, monitors funded investigators’
records of productivity, and integrates PF-sponsored research with the Enrichment Program."

10754281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organic nitrate esters are long-appreciated treatments for cardiovascular disease (CVD), leading causes of
death worldwide. Of note, organic nitrates have never been detected biologically, and their vasodilatory effects
are attenuated by the development of nitrate tolerance and endothelial dysfunction, highlighting an urgent need
for alternative therapies. In this context, dietary interventions reduce CVD incidence and mortality. While benefits
of the dietary interventions are clinically well documented, new data continues to emerge as to the contributions
of individual dietary constituents in mediating beneficial downstream responses. Consumption of fruits,
vegetables, meat, and dairy products provides a rich source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and the inorganic
anions nitrite (NO2−), and nitrate (NO3−). Strong evidence reveals that NO2− and NO3− are readily transformed
by metabolic and inflammatory conditions promoting nitration of CLA and yielding electrophilc nitroalkene
derivatives (NO2-FA), which induce reversible alkylation of nucleophilic cysteine (Cys) residues with consequent
post-translational modification (PTM) of many functionally-significant regulatory proteins. Preclinical and clinical
data affirm that NO2-FA induce pleiotropic adaptive and anti-inflammatory gene expression responses. We
recently reported that the acidic gastric environment and the conjugated double bound of CLA results in a novel
NO2−-mediated unsaturated fatty acid nitration mechanism that is critical for generating organic nitrate-containing
fatty acid derivatives, termed nitro-nitrate fatty acids (NO2-ONO2-FA). Preliminary data indicates that NO2-ONO2-
FA: a) are not only endogenously-generated in vivo by digestive reactions of CLA + NO2− but also upon ex vivo
myocardial I/R injury, b) survive intestinal absorption, are incorporated into chylomicron triglycerides and reach
the systemic circulation, c) are non-electrophilic that then decay to an electrophilic NO2-FA product after
releasing secondary nitrogen oxides and d) can induce concerted salutary PTM effects and guanylate cyclase
activation. From this insight, it is now hypothesized that NO2-ONO2-FA derivatives promote vasodilation and
inhibit cardiovascular inflammatory responses via both cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent
signaling actions. The rationale for pursuing this project is to define the biochemical formation and unique PK
and signaling actions of NO2-ONO2-FA, that current data support is a small molecule mediator that displays the
pharmacology of both organic nitrates and Cys-reactive electrophiles. We also better define the scope of
endogenous products stemming from the metabolic reactions of both a healthy diet and inflammation. The goals
of the proposal are: 1) to define the metabolic and inflammatory generation and PK of NO2-ONO2-FA and 2) to
quantify the in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular responses to NO2-ONO2-FA in the context of both vasodilatory
and vasoprotective cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent signaling. Successful completion of the proposed
research plan can lay the foundation for a safe pharmacological strategy targeting inflammatory-related CVD."
10767320,"Astrocytes as governing pathological drivers of neurovascular dysfunction in AD
Abstract:
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease, characterized by
cognitive decline. The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and the etiology has yet to be fully elucidated. The
pathological manifestations of AD involve amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), as well
as a significant synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration, and a neuroinflammatory process accompanied by
microglial and astrocytic activation. Specifically, the role of astrocytes in AD is very limited, although their
contribution is likely crucial in the initiation and progression of AD. Astrocytes undertake numerous
fundamental functions for the general homeostasis of the central nervous system, maintaining normal brain
activities, and are key players in aging and dementia. Astrocytes are vital for maintaining the health of the
neurovascular unit such as (but not limited to): contributing to synaptic transmission, blood flow dynamics,
neurovascular coupling, glutamate homeostasis, potassium homeostasis, osmotic regulation, removal of
interstitial waste products from the parenchyma, contributing to blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, sleep health
and wakefulness. Astrocytes play an important role in functional hyperemia, in which local increases in blood
flow meet the metabolic demands of increased neuronal activity. These findings highlight astrocytes as a
central player within the neurovascular unit. Astrocytes demonstrate functional activity through calcium
signaling, however, the role of astrocytic calcium signaling pathophysiology in neurovascular unit dysfunction
remains poorly understood. We will test our governing hypothesis that astrocytic calcium signaling
pathophysiology is a major governing pathological driver of neurovascular unit dysfunction in AD and
an exciting and novel disease modifying therapeutic target. We have powerful in vivo tools and expertise
to thoroughly test this hypothesis in vivo with multiphoton microscopy. We will image calcium concentrations
and dynamics using genetically encoded calcium reporters targeted to astrocytes or neurons in all of the
cellular compartments within single astrocytes, along with amyloid deposits, the vasculature, and neuronal
calcium signaling to identify the mechanism of the astrocyte pathophysiology observed in mouse models of
AD. We will interrogate the system through observations of plaque proximity, test the direct role of soluble
Abeta oligomers, and use a functional hyperemia approach based on a visual stimulation paradigm to evaluate
the deterioration of the function of the complete neurovascular unit. These experiments in total will determine
which components of the neurovascular unit are compromised and when over the lifetime of the mice.
Ultimately, this will guide decisions for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in AD."
10814171,"Abstract
Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) demonstrate cognitive decline without major functional
impairment but also experience a 7-fold increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, a leading cause of
poorer quality of life (QOL), premature mortality, and health care expenditures. Sleep and biobehavioral rhythm
disturbances (disruptions in 24h oscillations in physiology and behavior, including rest-activity patterns and
mealtimes) are more than twice as common among patients with MCI than cognitively intact older adults.
Emerging evidence demonstrates a mechanistic role of sleep and biobehavioral rhythm disturbances in
cognitive decline and the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Importantly, the consequences
of sleep and biobehavioral rhythm disruption in MCI extend beyond the patient, also affecting the
spouse/partner, as sleep is a “shared” health behavior for most adults. However, sleep and biobehavioral
rhythms are typically considered at the level of the individual. Building on our team’s pioneering work on sleep
as a shared experience among couples, we propose to investigate sleep and biobehavioral rhythms as
fundamental dyadic processes that contribute to the health and cognitive functioning of individuals with MCI or
mild AD and their partners. We will evaluate the daily and longitudinal effects of two dyadic processes in sleep:
interdependence (partners’ sleep patterns influence on each other) and concordance (i.e., the couples’
similarity in rest/activity and social rhythms such as meal timing). We will conduct a 14-day naturalistic study
protocol in order to examine the mechanistic associations between sleep and biobehavioral rhythms and
proximal indicators of daytime functioning, within a sample of 170 couples in which one partner evidences
cognitive impairment (MCI to mild Alzheimer’s disease). During the naturalistic study protocol, we will capture
sleep and biobehavioral rhythms via objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep and circadian rest-activity
rhythms and daily social rhythms, respectively. Also, we will include daily assessments of mood and
relationship quality, and we will use an innovative smartphone cognitive assessment that has been validated to
measure cognitive function in daily life. In addition, we will conduct comprehensive neuropsychological
assessments at baseline and again at two-year follow-up to examine how sleep and biobehavioral rhythm
disruptions at baseline predict cognitive decline over 2 years in both partners. Results of study will advance the
understanding of the daily and longitudinal relationships between the individual and couple-level processes in
sleep and biobehavioral rhythms that influence the progression of cognitive decline in a population at increased
risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease."
10745732,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of our research program is to develop small-molecule anticancer drugs. We focus herein
on a new chemical method to control aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling that drives tumorigenesis and
metastasis of many cancers, in particular, colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC affects about 4% of the population
and caused ~60,000 deaths in 2021. Despite decades of effort, drugging this oncogenic pathway has not been
successful. In 2009, we reported for the first time that Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be intercepted by small
molecules. Catalytic inhibition of tankyrases prevents the turnover of the Axin, which leads to a rapid
accumulation of Axin. The accumulated Axin then stabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex (DC) to facilitate
the degradation of β-catenin. However, using this strategy to treat cancer has not been successful. Recent
studies suggest that tankyrases can, paradoxically, support Wnt/β-catenin signaling through molecular
scaffolding. The unexpected dichotomous mode of action potentially explains the unsatisfactory outcomes of
various preclinical studies of tankyrase inhibitors. Although the mechanism by which tankyrases sustain Wnt/β-
catenin signaling is not clear, mounting evidence suggests that the tankyrase aggregation is responsible for it.
In this study, we will develop a chemical strategy to control the catalysis-independent function of tankyrases.
We will then use this new tool to study how tankyrases affect the dynamic assembly of DC. We will further use
a proteomic approach to delineate the catalytic and scaffolding functions of tankyrases with detailed
characterization of their mode of action. This work will help us understand how tankyrases control multiple
signaling pathways important to cancer. Additionally, we will compare the responsiveness of a large panel of
immortalized human colonic epithelial cell lines and CRC cell lines toward tankyrase inhibition and depletion.
We will then corroborate the results with in vivo studies. Correlating the cellular sensitivity with their genetic
background will provide potential biomarkers and inform therapeutic strategies for cancers. Overall, this project
will address the unsolved issue in drugging the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and improve our understanding of how
tankyrases control Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
10746135,"The female reproductive system ages before any other physiological system, making it the most sensitive
indicator of aging. Most women experience reproductive senescence around age 51, but many women
experience early reproductive aging (early menopause). This is a serious public health problem because early
reproductive aging is associated with early onset of infertility and increased risk of several diseases and early
death. Further, the consequences of early reproductive senescence are significant in women who delay
childbirth for personal and professional reasons. Despite the profound impact of early reproductive aging on
women’s health, little is known about the mechanisms underlying early reproductive aging. Our published and
preliminary data indicate that acute exposure to the environmental chemicals, di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), during adulthood increases several key indicators of early reproductive aging
in female mice. Further, published data indicate that activation of the inflammasome and inflammation are
hallmarks of reproductive aging and our preliminary data indicate that DEHP exposure increases inflammatory
macrophages in the hypothalamus, DEHP and DiNP exposure increase expression of inflammatory pathways in
the ovary, and DEHP activates resident macrophages in the peritoneal cavity. In addition, published studies
indicate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in regulating reproductive aging and
our preliminary data indicate that DEHP and its metabolite (MEHP) induce expression of the known AhR targets
in the pituitary and the ovary and that a specific AhR antagonist rescues ovarian follicles from phthalate-induced
inhibition of follicle growth. These impacts of phthalate exposure are of concern because phthalates are one of
the top contaminants present in human tissues and they are present in a myriad of consumer products, personal
care products, pesticides, wood finishes, adhesives, solvents, lubricants, defoaming agents, and medical
devices. Given our preliminary data, the importance of reproductive aging for reproductive health, and the
ubiquitous exposure of humans to phthalates, we propose to use mice to test the hypothesis that environmentally
relevant doses of DEHP and DiNP interact with the AhR pathway to cause inflammation and facilitate early
reproductive aging. To test this hypothesis, we will complete the following specific aims:1) compare the effects
of acute versus chronic exposure to environmentally relevant doses of DEHP and DiNP on the onset and
characteristics of reproductive aging, 2) determine if environmentally relevant phthalate exposure causes
inflammation, leading to early reproductive aging, and 3) determine if phthalates work through the AhR pathway
to cause early reproductive aging. Collectively, the proposed studies will greatly improve our understanding of
the mechanisms by which phthalate exposure causes early female reproductive aging. In turn, this work will set
the foundation for the identification and development of novel targets for the treatment of phthalate-induced
diseases, including early reproductive aging."
10747980,"ABSTRACT
The initial contact between newly transmitted group A streptococci (GAS) and its human host can be readily
thwarted by antibody (Ab) directed to the appropriate GAS antigens (Ags). To best simulate this
microenvironment, physiological (i.e., low) inoculum doses of GAS are essential. The goal of this proposal is to
identify Ags, alone and in combinations representing multicomponent vaccines, that are the most effective
targets of Ab-mediated immunity and collectively can provide worldwide coverage against all GAS strains.
The underlying rationale for the proposed approach rests on two principles: That serum obtained from children
just prior to a new GAS infection lacks protective Ab, and that serum obtained from most adults has at least
low levels of persisting protective Ab. The latter is based on the very low incidence of GAS infection in adults,
likely the result of protective immunity that developed following repeated infections earlier in life. Hypotheses
on protective Ag-specific Ab generated from analysis of pediatric serum (aim 1) are experimentally tested in
mice (aim 2). Pre-infection pediatric serum is analyzed for lack of protective Ab to leading vaccine candidates.
Adult serum is used as a source for purified immunoglobulin (Ig) specific to the vaccine target Ags missing in
susceptible children. Immunodeficient mice are passively immunized with the Ag-specific Ig purified from adults
and challenged with low infective doses of GAS. The Ag-specific Ig that confers protection in mice equates to a
human serum-based correlate of protection (CoP).
Four major forms of GAS disease are modeled in mice and evaluated for protective immunity: upper
respiratory tract infection, impetigo, skin and soft tissue infection and invasive disease. GAS from all three
major subpopulations of strains are tested: throat specialists, skin specialists and generalists. The Ag targets
evaluated are leading vaccine candidates and include broadly and semi-conserved Ags as well as surface and
secreted Ags. If successful, this work will identify a collection of Ag targets that can serve as the basis for
global protection. It will also deliver two new standardized platforms – screening of pre-infection human serum
Ab to GAS Ags and improved mouse models - for future identification and straightforward comparison of
additional GAS vaccine candidates."
10873129,"Our goal for the Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) Program is to facilitate new research development, and the career
development of scientists, through pilot projects that synergize with the overall objectives of the DRC. Since our
DRTC/DRC’s inception in 2008, the P&F program has been critical for growth in Center membership and
extramural funding. Our P&F Program was instituted to tap growing interest in diabetes-related research at UAB
and to foster development of junior members, create partnerships, and take advantage of core resources. Our
RFAs have attracted applications across the translational research spectrum, yielding a diversity of funded
proposals, including both clinical and basic research from both junior and senior investigators. To date, we have
funded 78 diabetes-related pilots (out of 372 proposals submitted); 44% were clinical research projects and 67%
were to junior investigators. In the past cycle (2018-2021), we received 58 applications and funded 20 with 50%
involving basic research and 50% clinical research. For the upcoming period our Specific Aims are:
 1) To identify and support new research projects of outstanding quality and innovation for pilot funding,
ultimately resulting in substantial extramural support for development these new lines of investigation.
 2) To support promising junior faculty in career development through funding of outstanding pilots.
 3) To augment the breadth and quality of DRC research by funding innovative projects of established
researchers new to diabetes or of established diabetes investigators testing novel high-impact hypotheses.
 4) To increase the independent investigators in the DRC funded by NIH to conduct diabetes research.
 As evidence of success, 78% of P&F awardees over the past cycle of our program (2017 to 2021) achieved
external funding for this research; when the initial six years of the requested period are considered (2012-2017,
this fraction is ~86%. More than 90% of P&F awardees, including some not initially diabetes researchers, continue
in diabetes investigation. This speaks to the intellectual environment and community nourished by the DRC
Enrichment program, infrastructure support of DRC cores, commitment from academic leaders to recruit and
retain such investigators, and recognition that diabetes and cardiometabolic disease disproportionately affect the
population served by our Health System. To accomplish our aims, we have updated our online application
submission process and increased the expertise and diversity of our P&F Scientific Review Committee. We will
promote internal peer-review of applications taking advantage of programs sponsored by the UAB Center for
Clinical and Translational Research (i.e., the UAB CTSA) to strengthen both pilot applications and subsequent
larger extramural grant applications. With institutional DRC support and vibrant and growing UAB clinical and
basic science departments, our DRC P&F Program will build on its accomplishments to achieve greater success."

10757045,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project, we prospectively examine the associations and predictive ability of unmethylated insulin gene
(INS) DNA from 6-12 weeks postpartum and their subsequent changes several years later preceding the onset
of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among two cohorts of women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
We will leverage the extant resources from two large prospective studies of 1410 women diagnosed with GDM:
the Study of Women, Infant Feeding, and Type 2 Diabetes After Gestational Diabetes (SWIFT) in the U.S. funded
by NIH, and the Tianjin GDM Observational study (TGDM-O) in China funded by the European Foundation for
the Study of Diabetes (EFSD). The SWIFT study is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal cohort of 990 women
(75% minority; Asian, Hispanic, Black) diagnosed with GDM (2008-2011) who underwent three research 2-h 75
g oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) from 6-9 weeks postpartum (baseline), follow up Year 1 and Year 2 post-
baseline, and additional testing for diabetes up to 12 years (10/2020) via the Kaiser Permanente electronic health
records system. The TGDM-O study is a 4-year, prospective, longitudinal study of 420 Chinese women with
GDM who underwent 5 research 2-hr 75 g OGTTs from 6-12 weeks or ~1 year postpartum (baseline) to up to 4-
7 years after baseline (2020). All study participants have fasting glucose, 2-h glucose during serial 2-h OGTTs,
in addition to other laboratory (e.g., HbA1c, insulin, lipids), clinical (e.g., adiposity) and behavioral (e.g., diet,
exercise, lactation) measures at baseline and follow-up research visits. From the stored fasting serum samples
collected from multiple OGTTs, we will measure unmethylated INS DNA and methylated DNA at baseline, Year
1 and Year 2. In Aim 1, we will identify unmethylated INS DNA levels at 6-9 weeks postpartum and longitudinal
changes after baseline, and their associations with incident T2D up to ~12 years after GDM pregnancy in the
SWIFT. In Aim 2, we will determine the generalizability of Aim 1.a-d in the TGDM-O cohort by assessing
heterogeneity in effect estimates and computing pooled associations using a meta-analysis technique. In
exploratory Aim 3, we will identify whether unmethylated INS DNA levels at baseline and their temporal changes
are associated with baseline measures of IR and β-cell secretory function and their changes in Aims 1-2. If
successful, our study will provide novel methodology to assess β-cell death and help transfer this assay into
clinical practice for early prevention and potential treatment for inhibiting β-cell apoptosis."
10758288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) contains a desmoplastic stroma that limits blood perfusion and thus
the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and therapeutics, creating a hypoxic microenvironment that is able to resist
nearly all forms of treatment, including immunomodulating therapy. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are
the main components and producers of stroma in PDAC. The hypoxia-inducible factors-1 (HIF1) and -2 (HIF2)
are stabilized in low oxygen and have been hypothesized to mediate therapeutic resistance and aggressive
growth of PDAC, but deletion of HIF1 or HIF2 in the pancreatic epithelial compartment produced no obvious
phenotype in PDAC. Thus, we reasoned that HIF may instead be supporting PDAC pathobiology through its
functions in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the other major cellular component in pancreatic
tumors. Since little was known about the role of HIF in the stromal compartment, we created a mouse model
that exploits two recombinases enabling us complete spatiotemporal control of tumor growth and HIF ablation
in CAFs. Using this model, we found that the abrogation of HIF2 in CAFs decreased tumor growth and doubled
the median survival of animals with pancreatic cancer. The loss of HIF2 in CAFs correlated with fewer
intratumoral M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Furthermore, conditioned media from hypoxic CAFs
produced similar effects in ex vivo assays even after boiling. These preliminary data suggested a HIF2-
dependent crosstalk between CAF and the immune compartment that may be critical to the ability of PDAC to
evade the immune system. Building on this preliminary data, we propose to identify the molecular mechanisms
that allow hypoxic CAFs to modulate the immune microenvironment of pancreatic cancer through three aims.
In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mediators of HIF2-dependent crosstalk between CAFs and
macrophages. We will use mass spectrometry to identify the HIF2 dependent factor secreted from CAFs
capable of inducing M2 polarization in macrophages and determine how this factor is produce in CAFs and
how it alters macrophage function. Aim 2 will define the HIF2-dependent relationships between CAFs and T
lymphocytes. We will explore how CD8+ suppression and Treg conversion is regulated by HIF2 signaling in
CAFs using mouse models and co-culture methods. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will repurpose HIF2 inhibitors from
their current indications in renal cell carcinoma to pancreatic cancer as a drug to enhance immunotherapy
responses. The proposed research is significant because pancreatic cancer does not respond to
immunotherapy, and our data suggests that HIF2 inhibition may greatly improve immune responses. This
research is innovative because we will provide the first description of the immune-targeting molecular
pathways activated by hypoxic microenvironment in PDAC. Further, we will offer the first mechanistic
evaluation of a potential therapeutic combination using a HIF2 inhibitor along with immune checkpoint
blockade as the first steps towards clinical translation."
10770532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dopamine is produced by a small but impactful subset of neurons in the eye and brain. Because this
neuromodulator plays a critical role in a host of mental illnesses and diseases, it is vital to understand how
dopamine neuron subsets are established and maintained. Our preliminary data show that the serine-threonine
kinase LKB1 is required to restrict the number of dopaminergic neurons in the retina. In addition, we identify
new dopaminergic cell subsets and show that LKB1 is cell-intrinsically required in inhibitory interneurons to
modulate dopamine neuron diversity using molecular and neurogenetic approaches. This is a compelling result
because factors that control the number and type of neurons that produce dopamine have remained elusive.
To understand how LKB1 regulates dopamine neuron diversity, we have devised a strategy encompassing
neural identity and connectivity mapping, cell-type specific intersectional genetic and viral strategies, molecular
and biochemical studies, and functional analysis. We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we ask whether LKB1 is
spatially and temporally sufficient to instruct dopamine neuron diversity by modulating this kinase in specific
locations and at particular times. In Aim 2, we identify the mechanism through which LKB1 functions and test
the hypothesis that LKB1-AMPK signaling plays a critical role. In Aim 3, we extend our analysis to the midbrain
to test whether LKB1 is similarly required in this disease-relevant brain region to limit dopamine neuron
diversity. Identifying a kinase pathway that precisely controls dopamine neuron diversity is surprising, so
completing these aims will markedly advance our understanding of how dopaminergic neurons are endowed
with their unique properties. In addition, these results will provide new therapeutic avenues for restoring
dopamine production in the context of disease."
10765689,"Pancreatitis is a common, potentially fatal, disease of the exocrine pancreas. There are 2 major forms of
pancreatitis: acute (AP), which usually produces an episode of temporary illness, and chronic (CP), associated
with severe pain, poor quality of life, and increased risk for the deadliest pancreatic cancer. Pancreatitis is the
third most common reason for hospital admissions in those with GI disease and a heavy burden on the U.S.
healthcare system Major AP responses include inappropriate/intra-acinar activation of digestive enzymes,
increased serum level of amylase, neutrophil-driven inflammation, and acinar cell death. Key pathologic features
of CP are loss of acinar tissue, chronic inflammation and fibrosis, ultimately leading to the loss of exocrine and
endocrine pancreatic function. It is believed that CP results from repetitive subclinical or clinically evident bouts
of AP. Excessive alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for both forms of pancreatitis; other key risk factors
are smoking and age. The prevalence of these factors results in high pancreatitis incidence in Veterans as well
as in military personnel.
 The pathogenesis of pancreatitis remains obscure and no effective treatment is available, primarily because
we do not understand the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that the
lysosomal/autophagy pathways – a key catabolic mechanism by which cells eliminate damaged or defective
cytoplasmic organelles and recycle their constituents for energy and biogenesis needs – are disrupted in
pancreatitis. Our recent study revealed that these pathways are critical for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis
in pancreas and their disordering results in acinar cell cholesterol overload. We further showed that the
cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin alleviated experimental pancreatitis. Taken together, these findings
suggest that cholesterol metabolism is a clinically relevant modulator of pancreatitis severity. To validate the role
of cholesterol dysregulation in driving pancreatitis and establish cholesterol synthesis pathway as a therapeutic
target amenable to pharmacologic intervention in pancreatitis, we propose to examine the effects of cholesterol-
lowering drugs with different action mechanism, simvastatin and bempedoic acid (BemA), on disease severity in
several dissimilar mouse and ex-vivo (cellular) pancreatitis models. These preclinical AP and CP models reflect
the spectrum of disease severity and etiologies, such as excessive alcohol consumption, gallstones, and ERCP.
Statins came to medical use 30 years ago; BemA, which elicits fewer adverse effects than statins, was recently
approved by FDA for lowering cholesterol.
 The proposed studies will examine the effects of these drugs on pancreatic cholesterol levels and disease
severity using various regimens of drug administration in both preventive and therapeutic modes. The Specific
Aims will determine the effects of simvastatin and BemA on pancreatitis parameters in preclinical models of AP
(Aim 1) and CP (Aim 2) and changes in cholesterol levels in these models (Aim 3A); and compare simvastatin’s
effects on ex-vivo pancreatitis responses in mouse versus human acinar cells (Aim 3B).
 If successful the study will provide information necessary to de-risk future clinical trials to validate the
repurposing of simvastatin and/or BemA for pancreatitis treatment, and thus address the unmet clinical needs of
Veterans. Comparative analysis of drugs’ effects in several preclinical pancreatitis models will allow us to select
the best candidate(s) for clinical trials by excluding treatment regimens with toxic effects in the pancreas,
insufficient cholesterol-lowering capacity, and/or little beneficial impact on pancreatitis responses. Repurposing
FDA-approved drugs can significantly speed up and lower the cost of these trials. Thus, the proposed detailed
study in preclinical models is a necessary prerequisite for clinical trials to assess the risks and benefits of our
novel approach to address Veteran healthcare needs."
10842225,"Our ability to identify genetic sequence variation in humans has thus far outstripped the field’s ability to
interpret these mutations. Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of thousands of genomic
loci associated with disease risk and human phenotypic traits, yet in few instances do we know the identity of
the exact causal mutation, nor the molecular mechanism behind its function. Much of this limitation is due to a
large portion of this variation residing in cis-regulatory regions (CREs), where our inability to identify a variants’
regulatory impacts or target gene(s) presents a major hurdle. Better understanding of this regulatory grammar -
the complex logic of how sequence content in CREs controls transcription – is a crucial next step for genomics,
but requires a vast expansion of well characterized regulatory mutations.
To achieve this goal, we will employ a multi-pronged approach to build a large-scale, regulatory variant
functional catalog. We will focus on CREs harboring genetically fine-mapped, likely causal variants from global
populations for a variety of metabolic traits and disease (Aim 1). We will first identify CRE-gene interactions
using highly-sensitive and scalable endogenous CRISPR approaches. This large-scale mapping effort will
inform our understanding of the CRE-gene targeting logic of regulatory grammar. We will use this data to map
the transcriptional architecture of metabolic complex traits. We then propose to interrogate sequence
determinants of regulatory grammar for hundreds of trait-associated CREs at their endogenous location in the
genome (Aim 2). We will first develop an endogenous saturation mutagenesis system to generate hundreds of
thousands of nucleotide changes in these CREs. We will then assay the regulatory architecture of these
changes using multiplexed amplicon ChIP-sequencing to identify epigenetic changes, and HCR-FlowFISH to
detect transcriptional changes. In addition to identifying causal variants for a variety of metabolic diseases, this
proposal will generate a repertoire of
300,000+ functionally characterized regulatory variants. This variant
impact catalog will serve as an ideal training set to model regulatory grammar with our powerful machine
learning approaches. We will incorporate endogenous saturation mutagenesis data into our variant effect
prediction models (VEPs). Importantly, such models will find utility across global populations as they will
explain a universal regulatory code of the human genome and thus enable interpretation of population-specific
variation. We will then deploy these VEPs to understudied variation and in understudied populations.
 Overall, this proposal is structured to generate a functional characterization catalog at multiple levels:
first providing molecular mechanisms and gene targets for thousands of causal variants, secondly building
comprehensive genomic etiological understanding for phenotypically related complex traits, and lastly
providing the scale of endogenous data necessary to improve VEPs. Our approach combines our group’s
unique expertise spanning functional genomics, CRISPR screens, statistical genetics, and machine learning."
10883549,"CSF1 is the principal colony stimulating activity released by osteoblasts in response to PTH treatment. Its
receptor, c-fms, is more highly expressed on mature osteoclasts than any other cell in bone. We found that
deleting c-fms in osteoclasts attenuates the anabolic response to PTH. This indicates that part of PTH's anabolic
actions could be via a paracrine loop in which PTH stimulates expression of CSF1 in osteoblasts, which then
acts on osteoclasts to induce anabolic clastokines that augment bone formation. There are two major isoforms
of CSF1: soluble (sCSF1) and membrane-associated (mCSF1). We found that the anabolic response to PTH
is augmented in animals only expressing the sCSF1 isoform due to a greater increase in osteoblast
number in these mice compared to PTH-treated controls. In striking contrast, animals only expressing
mCSF1 had no increase in bone mass in response to an anabolic PTH regimen. Importantly, sCSF1 and
mCSF1 differ in the kinetics and extent to which they activate the CSF1 receptor, c-fms, suggesting that their
divergent in vivo actions may be due in part, to intrinsic differences in cell-signaling. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that mCSF1 inhibits PTH anabolism by opposing the actions of sCSF1 on osteoclasts. When
unopposed, sCSF1 contributes to PTH anabolism by inducing production of anabolic clastokines.
Specifically, single daily doses of PTH induce transient increases in sCSF1 in osteoblasts that cause
bursts of anabolic clastokine production. Consistent with this, we found that sCSF1 stimulates production of
the anabolic clastokine, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) in osteoclasts. To test these hypotheses, we will, in
SA1, determine if adding intermittent dosing of sCSF1 to an anabolic PTH treatment regimen augments
the skeletal response to PTH in wild type animals, while adding mCSF1 to that regimen attenuates the
response. We will then try to restore the anabolic response to PTH in the sCSF1-/- mice by treating with PTH
plus sCSF1. These experiments will provide pharmacologic evidence that the very different response to PTH in
sCSF1-/- and mCSF1-/- mice is directly due to differing actions of the two CSF1 isoforms in bone. In SA 2, we
will treat wild type mice that were ovariectomized 5 months earlier, with PTH plus sCSF1 to determine if
it restores bone mass to pre-OVX levels as a model of therapy for established post-menopausal
osteoporosis. In SA 3, we will determine if sCSF1 and mCSF1 induce production of different clastokine
profiles in mature osteoclasts. We will use osteoblast/osteoclast cocultures as a model of in vivo paracrine
signaling in bone and profile the transcriptome of osteoclasts exposed to PTH-treated osteoblasts expressing
only sCSF1 or only mCSF1 to identify differences in the types of clastokines produced. We will also determine
differences in the transcriptomes of osteoblasts in the cocultures stimulated by these different clastokine profiles.
Finally, we will examine binding kinetics of sCSF1 and mCSF1 to c-fms, and differences in downstream signaling,
to gain molecular insight into the divergent in vivo and in vitro actions of these two isoforms."
10930809,"Each year, millions of people are harmed or killed by pathogens that spill over from wild or
domestic animal reservoirs. A new approach to reducing the threat of spillover is to eliminate
the pathogen from its animal reservoir using transmissible vaccines that move from animal to
animal providing immunity to the pathogen as they go. Transmissible vaccines reduce the
vaccination effort required for pathogen control within animal reservoirs and allow the vaccine
to penetrate remote reservoir habitats where direct vaccination is impossible. Bringing this
revolutionary idea to fruition requires that we engineer vaccines that simultaneously: 1)
transmit efficiently from animal to animal, 2) stimulate a robust immune response to the target
pathogen, and 3) maintain their integrity in the face of evolutionary pressures. This project will
develop mathematical models that predict how these traits of the vaccine emerge from the
interplay between vaccine replication and the animal’s immune response. These models will be
parameterized and validated using laboratory studies of prototype transmissible vaccines that
use murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as a vector backbone. We focus on MCMV as a vector
because it is highly species specific, capable of superinfection, and provides a model for vaccine
development across murine rodents that serve as important reservoirs for a wide range of
human pathogens. The models will be validated using experiments with immune depleted mice
that challenge their ability to explain both pattern and process. Work on this project capitalizes
on an existing collaboration between experts in mathematical modeling, viral evolution, and
murine cytomegalovirus."
10834143,"ENHANCING THE CALERIE NETWORK TO ADVANCE AGING BIOLOGY
ABSTRACT:
In direct response to PA-20-071, Advanced-Stage Development and Utilization of Research Infrastructure for
Interdisciplinary Aging Studies), we propose to enhance and grow the CALERIE Research Network into a self-
sustaining infra-structure of samples, data, and aging biology investigators. The Comprehensive Assessment
of Long-Term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) was a randomized controlled trial designed to
assess the effects in humans of two years of sustained caloric restriction without enforced changes of dietary
composition. The overall objective was to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms and mediators of
primary and secondary human aging. The rigorous design and execution of the CALERIE intervention
produced an invaluable resource, including comprehensive phenotypic data that are coupled to biological
samples. To ensure continued use of these samples and data, we describe a plan to create a self-sustained
CALERIE Network. Our aims are to advance aging research through enhanced 1) utilization, 2) development
and interdisciplinary growth of the CALERIE Research Network. Utilization of CALERIE resources will be
promoted and stewarded by a Steering Committee, an NIA Biobank representative, NIA-supported Networks
and Centers, annual workshops and working groups. These efforts will ensure best use of remaining CALERIE
samples as well as incorporation of new data into a complex multi-level database. CALERIE Network inter-
disciplinary growth will be fostered by attracting new and junior aging biologists to pilot projects, career
development activities, and a rich pipeline of integrative systems biology projects. By developing more
investigators, projects, and disciplines, new data and samples will be generated and will perpetuate the aging
biology scientific cycle. Thus, completion of these aims should yield a mature, sustainable infrastructure that
maintains and oversees CALERIE samples and data, perpetuates CALERIE ancillary integrative
investigations, and contributes to overall advancement of understanding of human aging biology."
10814798,"Double-strand breaks in DNA are a lethal form of genome damage that can also lead to large-
scale chromosomal rearrangements and deletions when mis-repaired. Non-homologous end
joining and homologous recombination are the two major pathways of DNA double-strand break
repair in eukaryotes, and the decision between these pathways can have long-lasting
consequences for cell fate. Current models of DNA repair suggest that non-homologous and
homologous recombination factors compete with each other for end binding, processing, and
repair in a manner that favors homologous recombination during the S and G2 phases of the cell
cycle, but this competition is still ill-defined despite many years of study. Here we build upon our
recent results showing that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex performs end processing in
physiological conditions that depends on the core non-homologous end joining complex, DNA-
dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Ensemble biochemistry, single-molecule experiments, and
quantitation of DNA repair intermediates in human cells shows that MRN-mediated end
processing occurs at DNA-PK-bound ends, promoted by the cell cycle-regulated repair factor
CtIP. These results suggest that DNA double-strand break repair ""choice"" is not a competition,
but rather a sequential and ordered process from non-homologous to homologous pathways. To
validate these results and understand double-strand break recognition and processing at a
mechanistic level, we propose to further investigate the characteristics of DNA end processing
globally in human cells. We will test our hypotheses by analyzing the regulation of DNA end
processing by by Mre11 nuclease activity and CtIP modifications, and will examine the
characteristics of DNA end processing as it occurs in non-cycling cells. Lastly, we will
investigate the structural biology of the cooperative, multi-subunit end repair complex that MRN
forms with DNA-PK on DNA ends, with both recombinant proteins as well as native complexes
from human cells. These experiments will further establish novel methods for characterizing
DNA repair intermediates and solidify a new paradigm in DNA double-strand break repair that
mechanistically links non-homologous end joining with the initiation of homologous
recombination."
10788277,"Project Summary / Abstract
The primary cilium is critical to vertebrate development and the prevention of disease. Severe defects in this
organelle lead to prenatal lethality in extreme cases and a variety of structural birth defects and degenerative
diseases in less extreme cases. The primary cilium serves as a cellular antenna to monitor the extracellular
environment and feed information back to the cell to coordinate its action with that of the surrounding cells.
Several signaling pathways are directly or indirectly regulated by cilia but of these, Hedgehog is particularly
important in vertebrate development. Understanding how the cilium is assembled and how the signaling
environment is created and maintained is critical to understanding how this organelle functions in the etiology
of human diseases. The cilium is assembled by the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT). During IFT, large
protein complexes called IFT particles (composed of IFT-A, IFT-B, and BBSome sub particles) are carried
along the ciliary microtubules by kinesin and dynein motors. IFT transports proteins made in the cell body into
the cilium to build and maintain the structure. In addition to building cilia, IFT is an integral part of the
Hedgehog signaling. Hedgehog signaling is initiated by Hedgehog ligand binding to ciliary-localized Ptch1.
Activated Ptch1 leaves the cilium and allows Smo to activate. Activated Smo accumulates in cilia, and this
drives a third receptor, Gpr161, out of cilia. The Gli transcription factors then accumulate at the ciliary tip and
become activated before moving into the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
In past funding cycles, we discovered that the Ift25/Ift27 subcomplex of IFT-B is not needed for ciliary
assembly but is critical for Hedgehog signaling by removing Ptch1 from cilia upon pathway activation and
keeping Smo levels low at the basal state. Our work showed that Ift25/Ift27 couple the BBSome to IFT-B
through an adaptor protein Lztfl1. The BBSome is likely to be the receptor recognition module of the IFT
particle. Understanding the mechanism regulating the interaction of Smo and Ptch1 with the IFT particle is
critical to understanding Hedgehog signaling. In the last cycle, we found that ubiquitination is likely to be the
key regulatory event. At the basal state, Smo is ubiquitinated on lysines K444 and K448, which marks the
receptor for removal from cilia by IFT. Mutation of these lysines or pharmacologically blocking ubiquitination
causes Smo to inappropriately accumulate in cilia at the basal state. The E2 Ube2l3 and the E3 Wwp1 localize
to cilia and appear to be responsible for the regulatory ubiquitination of Smo. Wwp1 binds to Ptch1. Activation
of signaling removes both Ptch1 and Wwp1 from cilia, thus providing an elegant mechanism for Ptch1 to
regulate ciliary Smo levels. We propose to extend this work by identifying adaptors that link ubiquitinated Smo
to the IFT particle and the determine the mechanism controlling Ptch1’s ciliary dynamics."
10750987,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft-tissue cancer. Despite treatment intensification,
the outcome for patients with advanced stage RMS has remained dismal. As of now, no targeted therapy is
available. Better understanding and treatment are clearly needed. In our preliminary study, we identified a novel
oncogene, AVIL in RMS. We found that, 1) AVIL forms a fusion with a house-keeping gene MARS in some RMS;
2) AVIL is overexpressed in the majority of remaining RMS we tested, yet hardly detectable in mesenchymal
stem cells or normal muscle tissues; 3) RMS cells are addicted to AVIL dysregulation in that silencing MARS-
AVIL (in RMS cells that harbor the fusion) or silencing AVIL (in AVIL overexpressed RMS) nearly eradicated the
cells, and dramatically inhibited in vivo xenografts, but had no effect on control cells; 4) conversely,
overexpressing AVIL promoted cell proliferation and migration, enabled fibroblasts to form foci, and transformed
mesenchymal stem cells; 5) sarcoma patients with increased AVIL expression have worse prognosis; and 6)
RMS cells are sensitive to our small molecules inhibiting AVIL. Based on these observations, our long-term
hypothesis is that AVIL is an Achilles heel of RMS, and targeting it may be an effective approach for treating the
disease. In this application, we propose the systematic investigation of AVIL as a novel target against RMS. Aim
1: Determine the efficacy of targeting AVIL in vitro. We will investigate its role in an expanded list of cell lines
and short-term explants of RMS PDX cultures. We will test the efficacy of tet-inducible shRNAs targeting AVIL,
and small molecule compounds we identified through small molecule screen. Since last submission, we also
generated over 70 novel compounds derivative of the initial hit compounds. We will test their efficacy in vitro. In
addition, we will determine whether AVIL expression serves as a biomarker for sensitivity to AVIL inhibition. Aim
2: Determine the efficacy of targeting AVIL in animal RMS models. We will use shRNA and small-molecule
inhibitors in xenograft models to test both the efficacy and safety of targeting AVIL in vivo. In addition, we have
generated both Avil transgenic and knockout models. We will cross Avil transgenic with various Cre strains to
test whether Avil overexpression is sufficient for RMS tumorigenesis. We will also use Avil knockout mouse
model by crossing them with RMS mouse models to test whether Avil expression is necessary for RMS
tumorigenesis in mouse. Aim 3: Investigate the downstream targets and mechanisms of AVIL inhibition and
identify potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers. We will investigate molecular mechanism under which AVIL
regulates FOXM1 stability, and determine the domain and exact activity on F-actin that are responsible for its
oncogenic activity. Aim 4: Assess AVIL-targeting lead compounds for optimal ADME (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, elimination), bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties. The proposed study will have a
significant impact on the understanding and treatment of RMS. The findings will pave ways to target AVIL as a
novel oncogene, and lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the desperate disease."
10751021,"Stroke is the one of the leading causes for death and the leading cause of long-term disability in the USA,
and most strokes originate from blood flow blockage known as ischemic stroke. Since the majority of cortical
ischemic strokes originate from blockage in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), our lab has studied stroke
protection in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Our findings have
demonstrated that sensory stimulation in the early 2 hours following pMCAo is protective but later (3-4 hours)
the same stimulation becomes damaging (known as infarct). It is assumed that the location and volume of either
the damaged or protected territory depends on the spatial structure of the occluded artery (e.g., MCA), but
research results in our lab point to an alternative hypothesis that the location and volume of an infarcted or
protected territory depends on the spread of evoked neuronal activity in cortex.
To address our hypothesis, we plan to apply state-of-the-art multi-modal battery of in vivo wide-field imaging
techniques including blood flow imaging and functional imaging of cortical activity. These imaging techniques
are complemented by optogentic stimulation, electrophysiological recordings using microelectrode arrays,
histological, pharmacological treatment studies, and by the development of machine learning algorithms.
These techniques will be employed to provide an unprecedented spatiotemporal, quantitative understanding
on how the spread of evoked activity is pivotal for predicating the location and volume of the infarcted or
protected cortical territory. Finally, to increase the translational potential of these studies, these techniques
will be applied in old rats that represent the population most vulnerable to stroke, and in awake, head-fixed
young and old rats to increase the translational potential of our research."
10741830,"Chronic heart failure (CHF) has a designated Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) in the VA
system to address ways to improve cardiovascular healthcare for Veteran’s suffering from CHF. Success in
treatment of CHF associated with chronic pressure overload (hypertension, aortic valve stenosis) is limited by
the presence of persistent interstitial fibrosis despite our ability to normalize hemodynamic load. The
proposed studies will define abnormalities in cellular mechanisms that cause this critical clinical unmet need.
Filling this need will depend on defining the fundamental causal determinants that control both initial ECM
degradation and persistence of interstitial myocardial fibrosis following normalization of hemodynamic load.
Primary cellular regulators of ECM homeostasis are postulated to be myocardial macrophages and fibroblasts.
Our previous studies and preliminary data have led to our central hypothesis: Chronic hemodynamic
overload causes fundamental changes in both macrophage and fibroblast phenotype, the hallmark of which is
dysregulated protease homeostasis that in turn impedes cellular response to unloading and limits complete
regression of fibrosis even after normalization of hemodynamic load. To test this hypothesis, innovations in in
vivo animal models and in vitro fibroblast culture were developed. In vivo, a clinically relevant reversal of LVPO
(unloading) was created in mice by surgical removal of the transverse aortic constriction (unTAC). UnTAC was
found to initiate but lead to an incomplete regression of cardiac fibrosis. Preliminary data indicate that a
significant increase in myocardial macrophages coincides with initiation of collagen degradation following
hemodynamic unloading but these increases in macrophages are not sustained at later times after unTAC. To
address whether load-dependent changes in fibroblast phenotype were a key factor in this remodeling, a
fibroblast culture systems that mimics clinically relevant myocardial stiffness was established. In vivo,
measurements of myocardial stiffness demonstrated that fibroblasts are exposed to a force of ~8 kPA in PO
myocardium and ~2 kPA in normal myocardium. Physiologically relevant, stiffness-dependent changes in
fibroblasts phenotype were observed in fibroblasts from normal myocardium whereas fibroblasts from TAC and
unTAC myocardium exhibited a pro-fibrotic non-responsive phenotype to changes in stiffness. Preliminary data
indicate that Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was a causal factor in this pro-fibrotic persistent
phenotype. Our strong preliminary data gave rise to the following Specific Aims to test our central hypothesis:
Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that reversal of sustained hemodynamic overload shifts myocardial
macrophage phenotype to a distinct but transient anti-fibrotic (ECM-degradation) phenotype that
initiates, but does not complete, a load-dependent regression of accumulated interstitial ECM.
Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that sustained in vivo increases in hemodynamic load change myocardial
fibroblasts to a profibrotic, TIMP-1 dependent phenotype that remains profibrotic even when
hemodynamic load is reversed."
10805513,"The diets of US children are suboptimal and effective primary prevention interventions are
urgently needed to shape dietary behaviors early in life, especially among Latinx families, who
experience higher prevalence of obesity and cardiovascular disease. The community energy
balance framework suggests the need to intervene at multiple levels, while addressing cultural
and contextual factors, to effectively impact diet quality for disease prevention including: 1) Child
level, including appetitive traits (satiety responsiveness (sensitivity to internal satiety signals),
food responsiveness (sensitivity to external food cues), and food fussiness; 2) Parent level
including the food parenting practices they use to feed children; 3) Home level including the
availability and accessibility of food, and; 4) Broader context including social determinants, food
security/access to healthy foods. While there have been several interventions aimed at
improving the diet quality of young children, few have targeted more than one of these levels
and almost none are tailored to a child’s appetitive traits, culturally appropriate, and convenient
for busy, working Latinx families. Further, most have only focused on what parents should not
be doing, rather than supporting what they should be doing. This proposal will build on our
recently completed R34 pilot feasibility trial (R34HL140229-01A1) to test the efficacy of a novel
home-based intervention with 257 Latinx families of preschool children. The proposed 6-month
intervention will include: 1) Three home visits by a community health worker (CHW) trained in
brief motivational interviewing that include in-home cooking demonstrations to prepare a meal
involving the child; using a family meal-time video to provide feedback on food parenting; 2)
Screening for social-determinants of health and connecting families to federal/state/local
resources; 3)Text-messages (2x/wk); 4) Tailored materials/messages; and 5) Three CHW
phone calls to reinforce food parenting, food resource management and healthy eating.
Specific Aims are to: Improve quality of the dietary intakes of 2–5-year-old children (Aim 1);
Improve food parenting practices (Aim 2); and Improve the home availability of healthy foods
(Aim 3). Exploratory aims will assess: the relationship between outcome measures and
intervention dose; the relationship between outcome measures and potential mediators and
moderators and the intervention’s effect on child BMI. This study fills an important research gap
by targeting the home food environment with positive food parenting while acknowledging a
child’s appetitive traits. It also meets the NIH call for needed research to reduce health
disparities among Latinx populations and has the potential for high public health impact."
10755338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase
in serum creatinine level, with or without a reduction in the amount of urine output. Tragically, between 2009-
2019, hospitalizations in the US complicated by AKI increased by 42%. The long-term objectives of this
application are to better understand the kidney local microenvironment and its impact on AKI with an eye towards
development of new treatment strategies. The AKI research field believes that renal tubules are the epicenter of
damage, yet little attention has been paid to changes in the renal local microenvironment and associated repair
processes, which are certain to impact AKI. The concept of a ‘microenvironment’ has shaped the understanding
of the pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the AKI microenvironment is poorly characterized. The kidney
local microenvironment in AKI - consisting of injured tubular cells, activated fibroblasts, inflammatory cells (e.g.,
macrophages), other cellular components, extracellular matrix (ECM), and a variety of secreted factors - is
complex, heterotypic, and dynamic. After AKI, in general, renal tubules undergo a repair process of
dedifferentiation. During this process, ECM is the major organizing component for microenvironment construction
and tubule repair, serving as a scaffold for remodeling. The major cellular source of ECM synthesis in the kidney
is interstitial fibroblasts. Several subpopulations of fibroblasts are activated exceptionally early after AKI (1h), far
earlier than tubular cell proliferation (3d). This suggests that fibroblast-derived proteins may act early in AKI. To
explore this idea in depth, matrix proteins were compared between AKI and control kidneys using ischemic
kidney models and proteomics. This identified extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1; a secreted glycoprotein) as
the earliest and highest activated matrix protein after ischemic AKI. ECM1 was induced rapidly (4-8h) after AKI
and localized predominantly to fibroblast-rich foci in the kidney interstitium. It was also found that after AKI, Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh) growth factor secreted by renal tubules specifically targets fibroblasts to mediate cell-matrix
interactions. Further study revealed that ECM1 binds to Shh in vitro, knockdown of ECM1 aggravates AKI in vivo,
and ECM1 peptide prevents tubular cell death in vitro. Based on these observations and the role of macrophages
in microenvironment formation, it was hypothesized that after AKI, ECM1 directly recruits Shh, which activates
fibroblasts and macrophages to form a favorable microenvironment to promote kidney remodeling. This
hypothesis will be tested by determining the mechanistic role of ECM1 in kidney microenvironment formation ex
vivo (Aim 1); determining the roles of injured tubules, activated fibroblasts, and macrophages in constructing the
kidney microenvironment after AKI (Aim 2); and determining the role of the ECM1-organized cell-matrix
interactions in promoting AKI repair in vivo (Aim 3). Our investigations have broad implications for elucidating
mechanisms for kidney repair and designing novel therapeutic regimens to prevent or mitigate AKI."

 This five-year plan for the Pathway to Independence Award will help launch Dr. Jinshil Hyun’s independent
research career focused on environmental/behavioral factors that modify trajectories of cognitive aging and
Alzheimer’s disease and associated dementia (ADRD). Her proposed aims use geospatial and GPS-based
methods to comprehensively characterize the impact of neighborhood on cognitive health. Her proposed
training will supplement her expertise in ambulatory cognition and cognitive aging with a foundation in neuro-
epidemiology (Dr. Lipton), spatial analysis and urban health (Dr. Lovasi), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The
proposed research and training plan will leverage rich dataset from the Einstein Aging Study and existing
resources at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The findings from this study will identify person- and
contextual-level risk profiles for ADRD, which will ultimately support personalized and population-level
interventions, especially among vulnerable populations.
 There have been important advances in our understanding of risk and protective factors for ADRD,
including studies that explore the impact of neighborhood environments on cognition. Although most studies
used data from objective measures of geospatially-defined neighborhoods, individuals’ perception of their
neighborhoods and person-specific experience of neighborhood environments may vary among individuals
even within the same area. This project aims to investigate the influence of neighborhood characteristics,
assessed by (i) objective, geospatially-defined and subjective neighborhood aspects and (ii) GPS-based,
person-specific activity space measures, on cognitive decline, ADRD, and cognitive health disparities. The PI
will process and analyze data collected from the Einstein Aging Study’s annual ecological momentary
assessments battery. Continuous GPS tracking from smartphones will allow to characterize person-specific
neighborhood experiences (i.e., activity space). Cognitive outcomes will be measured by both yearly
conventional neuropsychological tests and smartphone-based ambulatory assessments (6x/day) over 14-day
burst data collection periods each year of follow-up. In the K99 phase, the PI will examine how objective and
subjective neighborhood aspects are associated with cognitive outcomes (Aim 1). In this phase, the PI will also
complete training in spatial analysis, and based on that, will process GPS data and develop/validate activity
space measures. In the R00 phase, the PI will examine the associations of GPS-based activity space with
cognitive and brain health (Aim 2), and subgroup (e.g., biological sex, race, APOE e4) differences in the
associations (Aim 3). Aims 1 to 3 results will provide the basis for an R01 application in the fourth award year.

10774260,"Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among women in the US. While
advances in treatment and early detection have contributed to a decline in death rates, BC is still a major killer
of women both in the US and globally highlighting the need to identify new molecular circuits and treatment
strategies to combat this disease. Work from our funded Merit studies and others has shown that the RON
receptor tyrosine kinase is highly overexpressed in human BCs and is an independent predictor of worse overall
survival, early death and metastatic progression. Interestingly, our recent studies show that RON expression is
independent of molecular subtype suggesting that this protein may serve as a powerful new marker for
metastasis, poor prognosis and recurrence across all BCs. While RON overexpression is a decisive factor in
human BC progression, our knowledge about the mechanisms by which RON promotes the development of
aggressive disease is limited. Previously, our laboratory produced transgenic mice with mammary-specific RON
overexpression. These mice, referred to as MMTV-RON mice, mimic the aggressive disease pattern observed
in human patients with all female mice developing highly metastatic breast tumors. In this clinically relevant
model, we discovered that mammary tumors upregulate the RON ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein
(HGFL). Utilizing MMTV-RON mice deficient in HGFL, we published the requirement of HGFL for oncogenic
RON activation and mammary tumor growth and progression. Utilizing HGFL deficient BC cells, we showed that
reconstitution of HGFL promoted tumor cell autonomous survival, migration and invasion. Further, we showed
that global HGFL loss also reduced breast cancer stem-like cell numbers and altered the tumor
microenvironment (TME) by regulating immune cell recruitment, macrophage polarization, and cytotoxic T cell
responses. In complementary studies using the well-characterized polyomavirus middle T antigen mouse model
of BC, we show that RON loss specifically in mammary epithelial cells phenocopies the reduced growth,
metastasis and changes in the TME as global and tumor cell specific HGFL loss. We also demonstrate a
coordinate upregulation of HGFL and RON in human BCs. To gain mechanistic insights into the RON signaling
pathway, we performed RNA-Seq analyses of RON modulated human and murine BC cells. Surprisingly, we
found RON predominately suppressed pathways involved in Type I interferon (IFN), cytokine and pattern
recognition receptor (PRR) signaling. Investigating these pathways, we discovered a novel connection between
RON and suppression of IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4), an identified mediator of innate
immune responses downstream of PRRs. We also identified a reduction in IRF7, a key regulator of Type I IFNs,
with RON loss and IRAK4 expression. We show that IRAK4 introduction into RON expressing cells phenocopies
RON loss, while treatment of RON deficient cells with an IRAK4 inhibitor phenocopies RON expression with
respect to tumor growth and Type I IFN production. Based on this data, this proposal will test the hypothesis
that upregulation of tumor cell intrinsic RON promotes BC progression through effects on both the tumor proper
and TME through mechanisms that involve suppression of IRAK4 and ensuing Type I IFN production. Two Aims
are proposed to (i) determine the functional significance of tumor cell intrinsic RON signaling and Type I IFN
disruption in establishing a tumor permissive microenvironment to support BC growth, and (ii) define the role of
RON activation in suppressing the IRAK4-Type I IFN signaling axis to promote BC growth and metastasis. This
work is expected to provide new insights into mechanisms underlying aggressive BCs and will be instructive in
accessing combination therapies to direct clinical studies to combat BC deaths."
10896923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled three-dimensional (3D) genome structure profiling and
simultaneous capture of the transcriptome and epigenome within a cell. Quantitative tools are, however, still
unable to fully leverage the unprecedented resolution of single-cell high-throughput chromatin conformation
(scHi-C) data and integrate it with other single-cell modalities. To address this challenge, I propose to (1) Develop
a single-cell gene-body associating domain (scGAD) scoring system to explore single-cell 3D genomics data in
units of genes. (2) Construct machine learning-based models to impute histone modification and 3D chromatin
interaction for simultaneously profiling of each cell's epigenomic features and 3D chromatin architectures.
Subsequently, I will develop an epigenomic regulatory score (ERS) model to infer the cell-type-specific promoter-
enhancer regulation programs at the highest single-cell and single-gene resolution. (3) Validate and extend
scGAD and ERS pipeline to CAR-T immunotherapy study to gain insights into the impact of distal gene regulation
variations on patient responses. In Aim 1, preliminary analysis on human and mouse brain tissues demonstrated
that scGAD extracts gene features agreeing well with the scRNA-seq data from the same system. As a result,
scGAD facilitates the projection of cells from 3D genomics data onto reference panels constructed by scRNA-
seq embeddings with known cell-type annotations. Hence, scGAD provides an unprecedentedly accessible and
accurate cell type annotation method based on 3D chromatin architectures. Furthermore, the successful
integration of cells from different modalities into the same network facilitates information sharing across 3D
chromatin structures, the transcriptome, and the epigenome. Aim 2 leverages such multi-modal networks to build
an ERS model. ERS jointly models the histone profiles at the promoter and distal neighborhoods of the target
gene and the 3D spatial proximity between them. Therefore, the ERS scores quantify the regulatory effects of
distal elements on a per gene and cell basis. Aim 3 will extend the integration framework in Aim 1 and 2 using
scRNA-seq as a multi-modality bridge to CITE-seq data for a deeper annotation, especially for the Peripheral
Blood Mononuclear Cells. This enables the in-depth investigation of the apheresis samples from the Acute
Lymphoma Leukemia patients to gain insight into the roles of distal regulatory elements on gene expression and
their impact on the CAR-T cell therapy responses. To succeed in achieving these aims, I will pursue additional
training with mentor Dr. Steven Henikoff (epigenomics and gene regulation), co-mentors Dr. Raphael Gottardo
(statistics), Dr. Manu Setty (machine learning), Dr. Evan Newell (immunology), and collaborator Dr. Cameron
Turtle (CAR-T cell therapy). Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is an ideal institute for multi-omics single-
cell study with application to immunotherapy, providing cutting-edge research facilities and opportunities for
further career development in a rich interdisciplinary environment. A K99/R00 award will be instrumental in
addressing these challenges and furnishing me with high-level training to launch my independent scientific career."
10773105,"Abstract:
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a potentially blinding ocular disease that affects 60
million people world-wide. Reduction of IOP is currently the only glaucoma treatment, but fails to
preserve vision in a significant fraction of patients, suggesting that other –currently untreated-
factors contribute to the disease. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify these additional
pathomechanisms to aid the development of new therapeutic approaches that directly support
survival and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGC).
Our recently published studies have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of T-cells from
glaucomatous mice into normal recipients causes RGC loss in the recipients. We have also
demonstrated that the absence of T- and B-cells profoundly protects RGC in a mouse glaucoma
model. Preliminary data included in this application demonstrates that peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) of glaucoma patients contain a higher fraction of CD4 cells
synthesizing TNFα and exhibit a higher activation state than those of controls. We further
demonstrate that glaucoma PBMC have a heightened propensity to damage RGC in an ex vivo
assay when compared to controls. Together, these findings strongly suggest that T-cell
mediated damage is one of the mechanisms contributing to RGC loss in both animal models
and in human patients.
This project is designed with the long-term goal to determine whether modulation of immune
responses provides vision saving benefits to glaucoma patients. The objective of this application
is to establish which subtype of CD4 T-cells mediates damage in the glaucoma retina and to
determine the functional significance of CD4 cell derived TNFα. To test our novel hypothesis we
will employ a transgenic mouse model of myocilin-associated spontaneous glaucoma that we
previously developed (Tg-MYOCY437H) containing an inducible Tnf knockout allele. We have also
developed a novel in vitro assay allowing the quantitation of the cytotoxic activity of patient
PBMC targeted toward RGC. Finally we propose to determine the activities T cells extravasated
in the glaucoma retina, as well as those in lymph nodes and PBMC by establishing detailed
gene transcription profiles.
Experimental proof that CD4 T-cell mediated mechanisms contribute to vision loss in patients
would establish new targets for the medical treatment of glaucoma. These in turn will pave a
way for future clinical studies with the ultimate aim of preserving the sight and improving the
quality of life of patients with primary open angle glaucoma."
10745934,"Abstract
Chronic pain is a pervasive global health issue affecting about 20% of individuals worldwide, but available
treatments for chronic pain are still inadequate. Opiates have been used for centuries as potent analgesics, but
issues with tolerance, abuse, and overdose have contributed to current opioid crisis in the US. On the other
hand, it is well documented that the level of perceived pain can be strongly influenced by cognitive and mood
states, revealing the existence of powerful endogenous top-down modulation of pain. However, the
therapeutic potential of targeting descending pain modulation pathway in treating chronic pain has not been
extensively explored, in a large part because of our poor understanding of the circuitry and molecular
mechanisms underlying how these descending pathways engage in chronic pain. In our preliminary studies,
we developed novel genetic and viral tools, and gained robust access to the -opioid receptor expressing
spinal cord projecting neurons in the rostroventral medulla (OPRM+ RVMSC neurons). We demonstrated that
the OPRM+ RVMSC neurons has limited contribution to normal nociception but is required for both initiation and
maintenance of nerve injury induced chronic mechanical pain. We therefore established these neurons as a
potent cellular target for treating chronic pain. In this proposal, we will further examine the circuitry (Aim1) and
molecular (Aim2) mechanisms that engage the OPRM+ RVMSC neurons in chronic pain. These proposed
studies will not only advance our understanding of how the OPRM+ RVMSC neurons is recruited in chronic pain,
but also inspire the development of novel non-opioid treatment for chronic pain."
10912432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The largest cohort studies on the subject to date have found that adults with a low estimated sodium intake
had a higher risk of mortality than those with a sodium intake close to the population’s average. These findings
of a “J-shaped” sodium-mortality association have important implications for public health efforts on salt
because they suggest that reducing sodium intake at the population level could cause harm among a large
proportion of the population. Many investigators have criticized these cohort studies for their use of a spot
urine, rather than the gold-standard 24-hour urine sample, to estimate sodium intake. Thus far, however, the
debate on the shape of the sodium-mortality association could not be settled convincingly because analyses of
cohort studies that collected 24-hour urine samples have suffered from far smaller sample sizes than of those
that collected a spot urine. The overall objective of this project is to better understand the association of
sodium intake with mortality, particularly at levels of sodium intake below the population average in the US.
The central hypothesis is that the J-shape of the sodium-mortality association that has been reported by some
investigators is a result of bias from assessing sodium intake through use of a spot rather than a 24-hour urine
sample. This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the range of
sodium intake among adults that is associated with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality; 2) Determine whether
the commonly reported increased risk of mortality at low levels of sodium intake stems from using a spot urine
(rather than the gold-standard 24-hour urine) to estimate 24-hour sodium intake; and 3) Establish whether the
association of sodium intake with cardiovascular causes of death is the main determinant of the shape of the
sodium-mortality association. Using a case-cohort design, this project will analyze the sodium and potassium
concentration in urine samples collected as part of Lifelines, which is a population-based cohort study focused
on healthy aging in the Northern Netherlands. The Lifelines cohort has three unique features that enable the
investigators to make an important contribution to resolving the controversy about the J-shaped sodium-
mortality association: 1) Lifelines has collected two 24-hour urine samples from its participants; 2) with 147,888
adult participants and over 6,000 deaths (over a 15-year follow-up period), the Lifelines cohort has a far larger
sample size and number of deaths than any other cohorts that have collected 24-hour urine samples; and 3)
Lifelines has additionally collected a spot urine sample from all participants such that we are able to directly
compare the shape of the sodium-mortality association depending on whether a spot or the gold-standard 24-
hour urine sample is used. This project is significant because it will inform dietary guidelines on salt, and
whether public health efforts should attempt to lower sodium intake among the entire population (e.g., through
reformulation of the food supply) or focus instead only on individuals who consume high levels of sodium."
10935936,"ABSTRACT
One of the most common, and untreated, health problems among older adults is mobility disability, observed in
nearly one in five (17.9%) of older adults. Mobility disability is typically the first disability to develop and
increases future risk for additional disabilities and death. Though the most effective treatments for mobility
disability are forms of exercise, especially resistance training (RT), they are rarely used, with fewer than 20%
of older adults meeting RT guidelines and even fewer among those with mobility disability. The core problem of
disseminating the benefits of RT to older adults is adherence. One potential opportunity to enhance adherence
to RT, which has not been tested, is to make RT programs shorter. Studies show that most of the benefits of
RT accrue with the first few sets per week, consistent with the law of diminishing utility. While traditional RT
programs for older adults, like those offered by Silver Sneakers, are typically 45 minutes three times weekly,
fewer than 5% of older adults with free access to these programs participate. Our qualitative work shows that
older adults often feel that 45 minute sessions are too challenging (e.g., “I don’t think I have the strength to do
it for 45 minutes”) and 75% of older adults we surveyed preferred a 5 minute RT to a 45 minute RT option,
assuming they were equally effective. In 2020, we set out to design a brief, home-based RT program that
would lead to both high levels of adherence and functional improvement. We called the program FAST
(Functional Activity Strength Training) and, to overcome its brevity, FAST was augmented with several
standard behavior change techniques (e.g., feedback, reminders, self-monitoring) and a novel form of goal-
setting, rarely used in RT studies, for the number of additional repetitions participants should be able to do
during the study. In FAST-1, 24 healthy older adults were prescribed 30 seconds of squats and push-ups each
day and given no personal supervision. Over 6 months, they performed the exercises on 73% of days and
showed large increases in squat and push-up performance (Cohen’s d > 1.0). In FAST-2, we randomly
assigned 97 older adults with mobility disability, and those assigned to 30 seconds each of chair stands and
steps onto a stepper each day completed exercises on 81% of days (5.7 days per week) and improved their 5
time sit-to-stand test (-2.8 seconds, Cohen’s d=0.53), 30 second chair stand test (+4.2 repetitions, d=1.1) and
One Leg Stand test (+3.7 seconds, d=0.40), versus controls. In this multicenter study, we will randomly assign
360 older adults with an SPPB score < 8 to 6 months of daily FAST or to a delayed control group. We will test
the impact of FAST on physical performance, walking ability, falls and functional limitations. We hypothesize
that FAST will improve these measures more than controls, and that those with greater adherence and
perceived effort will improve the most. By rigorously testing FAST, we hope to change the paradigm of RT
prescription from “More is better” to “What will people do that works?” and, if FAST proves superior, a future
study will test whether FAST leads more older adults to do RT and, thereby, improve the public’s health."
10854991,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diabetes profoundly impairs the tissue repair process, leading to chronic non-healing wounds, which represent
a leading cause of lower limb amputations. The role of vascular pathology in impaired diabetic wound healing
(“under healing”) has been well established, and the role of external mechanical forces across wounds in
promoting excessive scar formation (“over healing”) is similarly well studied. However, the mechanisms through
which these countervailing systems interact within diabetic tissue to yield non-healing skin ulcers have yet to be
thoroughly examined. During prior years of NIH-funded research, important contributions have been made to our
knowledge of the critical role of vascular progenitor cells in normal and diabetic wound healing. These include
the first studies on single cell analysis of diabetic subpopulations during wound healing in both mice and humans,
which identified specific cell subtype depletions that contribute to impaired blood vessel formation and delayed
healing. More recently, the role of mechanoresponsive fibroblast populations in driving excessive skin scarring
and ineffective wound closure has been examined in similar pathologic states. To understand the effects of
diabetes and mechanical force on cell population dynamics with greater precision, we have developed novel
single cell techniques to identify critical perturbations in cell subpopulations. In this proposal, we will apply these
emerging -omics technologies to characterize the behavior of cell populations in non-healing diabetic wounds. It
is our fundamental hypothesis that local tissue mechanical forces contribute to the disruption of cellular ecology
in diabetic wound healing and that mitigation of these forces can improve healing. To achieve this, we will first
employ a novel multiplex approach to high-throughput single cell sequencing to evaluate changes to cell
populations in human diabetic wounds healing under different mechanical environments (Specific Aim 1). We
will then confirm the changes in human diabetic cell populations using animal models, while more precisely
assessing the effect of skin tension on healing kinetics (Specific Aim 2), which will further clarify the functional
role of these cells. Finally, we will use real world data (RWD) from electronic health records to evaluate the
efficacy of therapies aimed at offsetting mechanical forces, in order to develop clinical models to guide treatment
strategies (Specific Aim 3). Collectively, this work will enhance our understanding of diabetic wound biology and
its interaction with the external mechanical environment, paving the way for future therapeutic approaches, while
also providing generalizable clinical recommendations for force offloading therapies that can be readily applied
to guide treatment decisions at wound centers across the United States. The studies described in this proposal
reflect the multi-faceted approach to translational medical research that I hope to achieve moving forward in my
career as a clinician scientist."
10899419,"We propose an NIH Stage I (R61) study to adapt, refine, and pilot test a Web-based Care Partner Tool for
Feeding in Dysphagia (WeCareToFeedDysphagia), followed by an NIH Stage IV (R33) full-scale, 24-month,
randomized controlled trial (RCT), to determine the efficacy of WeCareToFeedDysphagia for reducing burden
in care partners of community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(AD/ADRD), diagnosed with oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) during hospitalization. OD, a devastating
syndrome that affects nearly 90% of hospitalized patients with AD/ADRD, is a significant predictor of care-
partner burden, which, in turn, leads to poor care-partner and patient outcomes (e.g., quality of life, QoL). Our
preliminary data indicate that, upon hospital discharge, care partners of patients with AD/ADRD face dramatic
and persistent unmet OD-related caregiving needs: A. knowledge deficits; B. unrealistic management
expectations; C. patient QoL considerations; D. inability to cope with patient’s frustration/refusal to eat
dysphagia diets; and E. lack of competencies/skills. The overall goal of this proposal is to reduce burden in
care partners of community-dwelling persons with AD/ADRD and OD using a single-component, easily
administered, intervention that addresses unmet OD-related caregiving needs. Guided by a self-regulation
theoretical framework, WeCareToFeedDysphagia will use written and video content, care-partner testimonials,
frequently asked questions, and resource links, to: A. provide accurate information (e.g., dysphagia diets); B.
set realistic expectations; C. identify/support feeding goals (QoL considerations); D. acknowledge/support
care-partner feelings; and E. provide competencies/skills for OD management. The R61 phase will adapt,
refine, and pilot test WeCareToFeedDysphagia to reduce care-partner burden by: adapting our existing web-
based tool by incorporating stakeholder input (Aim 1), resulting in WeCareToFeedDysphagia; refining the tool
through usability/acceptability testing (Aim 2); and conducting a pilot RCT (N=60) to determine the preliminary
efficacy of WeCareToFeedDysphagia to reduce care-partner burden, as well as the feasibility of a subsequent
full-scale RCT (Aim 3). We will assess care partner reported outcomes using technology (e.g., smartphones):
3-month post-hospital care-partner burden (primary outcome) and QoL (secondary outcome). The go/no-go
criteria for the full-scale RCT is defined as: feasibility as ≥50% consented, ≤20% attrition at 3 months, and
≥80% tool engagement; and preliminary efficacy as effect size of ≥0.3 for reducing care-partner burden. The
R33 phase will determine the efficacy of WeCareToFeedDysphagia to reduce care-partner burden by:
conducting a 24-month, full-scale RCT (N=406) at 11 diverse Northwell Health hospitals (Aim 4) and
conducting moderator and mediator analyses to examine the impact on intervention efficacy (Aim 5). The
proposal directly responds to NIA’s strategic direction to develop effective interventions to reduce the burden of
age-related diseases and improve QoL for persons with AD/ADRD and their care partners."
10866400,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Storytelling interventions for chronic disease, are described as personal narratives of living with the health
condition. Previous storytelling interventions have been effective in promoting healthy behaviors and lifestyle
change. For hypertension, storytelling interventions have contributed to reductions in blood pressure among
and increased uptake of lifestyle and behavioral change. Groups traditionally underrepresented in health
research and interventions, may not have access to innovative lifestyle interventions, but these communities
often have the greatest need for access to health interventions. Our preliminary work includes the Penn State
Clinical and Translational Science KL2 funded project titled Developing a Storytelling Intervention for African
Americans with Hypertension. During the KL2 project, nine African Americans with hypertension receiving care
at a Federally Qualified Health Center, were filmed sharing their stories of managing hypertension and sharing
helpful tips for lifestyle changes to manage hypertension. Our proposed intervention will consist of three
groups: 1) usual care 2) Storytelling (storytelling + educational information) accessed using a study website 3)
Storytelling Plus (group storytelling sessions + peer-led educational sessions and goal setting). Peer health
coaching has been a successful approach for promoting healthy behaviors and can be easily integrated into a
safety-net setting. We hypothesize that incorporating Peer Health Coaches into the storytelling intervention will
bolster the engagement with a storytelling intervention. Delivering the intervention using a study website
increases the accessibility of the intervention and allows the participant to view study materials at their
convenience. The outcomes for the proposed study are 1) to assess the feasibility of implementing the
Storytelling and Storytelling Plus interventions by assessing recruitment, retention, acceptability, and fidelity
and 2) the preliminary impact on self-reported medication adherence and blood pressure. The long-term goal
of this project is to develop storytelling interventions that can be integrated into the clinical workflow of a FQHC
and can potentially be disseminated to other FQHC and safety-net settings to promote healthy behaviors and
lifestyle change among African Americans with hypertension."
10868730,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The proposed R21 project will attempt to further develop a novel intervention for posttraumatic stress
symptoms inspired by the science of memory reconsolidation. Work in normal humans has shown that when a
stable, consolidated memory is reactivated (i.e., retrieved) under appropriate conditions, it reverts to an
unstable state, a process referred to herein as deconsolidation. In such a state, the memory is susceptible to
the action of various “amnestic” agents that may inhibit its reconsolidation, thereby weakening it. The β-
adrenergic blocker propranolol (PPNL) possesses such amnestic properties. More recent research has found
that in order to initiate deconsolidation, there must be a prediction error, or mismatch, between what is
expected and what occurs when the memory is reactivated.
Prior placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (PBO-RCT) from our laboratory have found that when
propranolol is administered concomitant with the reactivation of a psychologically traumatic memory, the
memory is weakened, as revealed by subsequent lower physiological (heart rate, skin conductance, facial
electromyogram) responding during script-driven mental imagery. Clinical applicability was evaluated in a
PBO-RCT, in which PTSD participants receiving propranolol underwent six weekly sessions of 10-20 min of
“standard” (STD) traumatic memory reactivation stimulated by reading a narrative. At post-treatment, these
participants showed a greater reduction of PTSD symptoms compared to participants who had taken PBO. The
goal of the proposed study is to test whether intentionally incorporating innovative mismatch (MM) into
traumatic memory reactivation can improve upon physiological responding during script-driven mental imagery.
Participants will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms: STD/PPNL and MM/PPNL. A baseline assessment
will measure psychophysiological responsivity to script-driven mental imagery (target measure). PPNL will be
administered 90-min prior to each of six weekly 10-20 min. traumatic memory reactivation sessions. In the MM
condition, a different, unexpected mismatch (e.g., singing the narrative) will be incorporated into the
reactivation. In the STD condition, the participant will read the narrative the same way each time. The focus of
the R21 proposal will be to assess whether the MM/PPNL group shows lower subsequent physiological
responses than the STD/PPNL group."

Dr. Jonathan Webster is an Assistant Professor of Oncology in the Division of Hematologic Malignancies at The
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He is a member of the Leukemia Group and has completed the
Science of Clinical Investigation curriculum at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. His primary
mentor, Dr. Richard Jones, is a Professor of Oncology and the Director of the Bone Marrow Transplantation
Program. His co-mentor, Dr. Ravi Varadhan, is a Professor of Oncology in the Division of Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics. His advisory committee includes Drs. Gojo and Smith, faculty experts in leukemia clinical trials,
and Dr. Luznik, a laboratory-based expert in allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) and
immunology. Support from the K08 award will enable Dr. Webster to gain additional research skills, receive
mentorship in authoring publications, develop grants, and perform his research project. Dr. Webster's goal is to
become an independent investigator and leader in the emerging field of post-alloBMT therapies. The use of
nonmyeloablative conditioning (NMAC) coupled with improvements in supportive care and graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, such as high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), have led
disease relapse to overtake transplant-related mortality as the major cause of treatment failure following alloBMT
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Two factors play a particularly
important role in post-alloBMT relapse: peri-transplant measurable residual disease (MRD), and the ability of
donor T lymphocytes to generate a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The prophylactic post-transplant use of
targeted therapies reduces relapses in high risk leukemias, but most patients lack targetable mutations. In this
application, Dr. Webster proposes to examine a more broadly applicable approach using the bispecific antibodies
blinatumomab and flotetuzumab as post-alloBMT maintenance therapy in ALL and AML, respectively. Dr.
Webster has significant preliminary data demonstrating the safety of blinatumomab in this setting and the ease
with which post-transplant maintenance therapies can be given following PTCy. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to decrease relapse following alloBMT in ALL and AML. He will achieve this by: 1. Conducting a
clinical trial of blinatumomab as post-transplant maintenance to assess safety and relapse-free survival. 2.
Conducting a clinical trial of flotetuzumab in post-transplant patients to assess safety. 3. Assessing the impact
of post-transplant maintenance therapies on the activation and expansion of T lymphocytes, T cell receptor
(TCR) diversity, T cell gene expression, and the depletion of cells expressing the target antigens (CD19 and
CD123). These studies will inform the development of randomized trials of post-transplant maintenance
therapies at the cooperative group level. Data regarding the efficacy of post-alloBMT maintenance therapies in
patients with peri-transplant MRD will inform future patient selection, while the immunologic correlates may
reveal biomarkers of response."

 Regulatory T cells (Tregs) mediate anti-inflammatory functions and have been most associated with self-
immunity and autoimmune diseases. However, given the underlying role of subclinical or persistent low-level
inflammation in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, attention has recently focused on the potential role of
Tregs in controlling the proinflammatory milieu in these pathologies. A subset of Tregs, the effector memory
Tregs, are the most suppressive, but are also the most transient. We made the striking observation that high-
density lipoproteins (HDL), but not other lipoproteins, significantly improved Treg survival. These findings offer
an explanation for the positive correlation we found between HDL cholesterol and Treg abundance. Our
preliminary data show that HDL preferentially bind and are internalized by Treg memory subsets, particularly by
effector memory Tregs, promoting their survival by reducing effector caspase activation. Mechanistically, our
new data also suggest that this HDL pro-survival effect may occur via activation of the AKT signaling pathway,
which results in enhanced de novo fatty acid synthesis and reduced mitochondrial oxidative stress. Since HDL
is a family of related particles with complex mixtures of lipids and proteins, we started exploring which HDL
subspecies or components stimulate Treg survival. We found that the pro-survival effect was mediated by the
HDL protein component, and particularly the relatively minor HDL protein constituent, apolipoprotein (APO)E,
and/or other proteins that co-reside on APOE-containing HDL. In contrast, the major HDL scaffold proteins from
the APOA family did not play a major role. Our overarching hypothesis is that APOE-rich HDL specifically interact
with Tregs to trigger pathways that limit caspase-dependent apoptosis. Aim 1 will identify the intracellular
signaling pathways involved in HDL-mediated survival of Treg, notably the receptor(s) involved in HDL binding/
internalization by memory Tregs and the mechanisms by which HDL promote Treg survival. We will also
determine the effect of HDL on Treg suppression. Aim 2 will identify specific HDL subspecies and protein
components that promote Treg survival. We will also perform deletional and site-directed mutagenesis
experiments to identify the critical region(s) of APOE, to inform explorations of synthetic peptides that can mimic
APOE’s pro-survival effects on memory Tregs. Aim 3 will assess the involvement of APOE-rich HDL in Treg
survival in vivo. We will leverage the Cincinnati Pediatric Diabetes and Obesity Center cohort and probe the
association between absolute numbers of Treg subsets, their functional characteristics, and HDL subspecies,
before and after weight reduction surgery. The ability of HDL subspecies collected before and after surgery to
promote memory and effector memory Treg survival will be studied. By identifying specific cellular pathways and
specific lipoprotein species responsible for the Treg survival effects, we will open new avenues for potential
therapeutic intervention aimed at modulating Treg function in a host of auto-immune and chronic metabolic
diseases."

Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) demonstrate deficits in language compared to
unaffected peers from similar language-learning environments. Conventional assessment methods for DLD
capture a child’s current skill level in one language; in the U.S., such assessments are available only in English
or Spanish. These methods fail sequential bilingual children, who speak a minority language at home and are
subsequently exposed to English, because they confound language-learning ability with prior language-
learning experience. Assessments that index language-learning ability are sorely needed, especially for
sequential bilingual children whose home language is not Spanish. This project evaluates two novel approaches
to language assessment for sequential bilingual children: dynamic assessment and processing-based
assessment. Dynamic assessment methods offer language teaching during the assessment and evaluate the
child’s response. Processing-based methods assess underlying skills that may drive language learning. This
project rigorously examines the psychometric properties of dynamic and processing-based assessments within
a diverse group of sequential bilingual children entering English-based schooling. We will recruit 165 children
aged 4 years, 10 months to 6 years, 2 months who speak any non-English language at home. The first study
timepoint will occur as children enter the school year and include an experimental assessment battery with
dynamic assessments at the narrative and morpheme levels and both linguistic and non-linguistic processing-
based assessments. The assessment battery will be repeated 1 month later. Aim 1 establishes psychometric
properties of the experimental assessment battery, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability,
factor structure, and concurrent validity. Aims 2 and 3 then use a longitudinal design to examine predictive
validity. Children will be followed over two academic years, with re-assessment every 4 months (totaling 5
growth timepoints following the initial assessment and test-retest timepoint). At each growth timepoint,
children will complete an English language sample and parents and teachers will be interviewed to assess the
language environment and presence of concerns regarding the child’s language. We will construct models of
English growth that account for child-external factors (e.g., language environment, SES) and then determine
how well the experimental dynamic and processing-based assessment battery predicts this growth (Aim 2). We
will then identify a group of children at high risk of DLD based on the combination of poor English growth and
parent or teacher concern regarding language development. Aim 3 will examine the sensitivity and specificity
of the initial assessment battery for predicting DLD. Project results will demonstrate whether multiple dynamic
assessment and processing-based assessment tools can reliably and validly measure language-learning ability
across variable language-learning environments. For millions of children who speak home languages other
than English, this project represents a critical step in validating language assessment tools."

Increasingly, it is recognized that high-value therapies, screening tools and preventive services have created or
increased inequalities experienced by persons from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds, those of low
socioeconomic position (SEP) and other vulnerable groups. This project aims to chart a new course for
understanding place-based population health strategies. A growing literature on health and place has
demonstrated the outsize influence of social and neighborhood indicators versus traditional clinical measures
in driving individual health outcomes. Thus, our overall objective is to empower community members and
organizations, local health systems and population health and political leaders to use evidence from place-
based research to inform, prioritize, evaluate and implement health-promoting strategies that close health
disparities. The cornerstone innovation of our work is the development of Digital Twin Neighborhoods which
will dramatically expand access to data and algorithms for understanding placed-based health and social
inequalities. Digital Twin Neighborhoods (DTNs) are digital replicas of real communities, including biological,
social and geographic data and algorithms in a cloud computing environment. In this project, we will i)
establish community- and privacy-focused procedures for constructing Digital Twin Neighborhoods which
incorporate EHR data; ii) evaluate the efficacy of a DTN approach to understanding mechanisms of place-
based health inequities in mid-life across multiple health conditions and geographies; and iii) examine the
generalizability and scalability of the DTN approach for studying place-based mid-life health inequalities. The
developed open science DTN platform will make the combination of modeling capabilities and privacy
preserving features available to multi-sector initiatives that are aimed at evaluating local health inequalities and
informing strategic population health policy decisions. Thus, the results of this work will i) provide a framework
for mechanistic understanding of clinical, social and environmental forces producing disparities in life
expectancy, multi-morbidity, and the onset and management of chronic disease and ii) catalyze researchers
and community and health care institutions both locally and nationally to improve equity and meet the needs of
the communities they serve."
10833614,"ABSTRACT
 Endocytic recycling is critical for a broad range of physiologic events, including nutrient uptake, cell motility
and polarity, intracellular signaling, and cytokinesis. We have been studying a coat complex that forms
transport vesicles in a recycling pathway, which involves ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil-coil, Ankyrin repeat and PH
domain type 1) acting as the inner component and clathrin as the outer coating. Recently, we have made a
remarkable discovery, finding that the protein kinase Akt acts as another component of this coat complex. Akt
also possesses a direct ability to bend membrane, a finding that is unprecedented, as no kinase is known to
possess this capability. Our recent discovery has also led us to reconstitute vesicle formation by this coat
complex. Altogether, these findings lead us to propose three major goals. First, an ultimate understanding of
how a protein bends membrane is being achieved through a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM)
approach that solves the structure of the protein assembled on membrane. As this is the functional form of
coat proteins, we will collaborate with a group having demonstrated expertise in the EM-based approach to
elucidate in molecular detail how coat factors assemble into a protein lattice structure on membrane to achieve
membrane bending. Second, whereas protein-based mechanisms of vesicular transport are being intensely
investigated, lipid-based mechanisms have been far less explored. Addressing this fundamental shortcoming,
we have recently pursued the vesicle reconstitution system to identify lipid enzymes needed for vesicle
formation by the ACAP1 coat complex. Thus, we will elucidate the specific stage of vesicle formation that
requires a particular enzyme. Moreover, to achieve a more complete understanding of how the lipid product of
a particular enzyme acts, we will explore whether the geometry of the produced lipid affects ACAP1 vesicle
formation, and also whether a particular lipid geometry promotes the ability of the ACAP1 coat factors to bend
membrane. Third, we have recently performed mass spectrometry on the reconstituted ACAP1 vesicles to
implicate many cargoes of the ACAP1 pathway. To validate this finding, we will focus on unexpected cargoes
for further scrutiny, as confirmation that they use the ACAP1 pathway will provide particularly compelling
support that our approach has identified true cargoes of the ACAP1 pathway. Specifically, we will mutate the
sequence in these unexpected cargoes recognized by the ACAP1 coat complex and then confirm that sorting
into the ACAP1 pathway is inhibited. We will also pursue an unifying explanation for the unexpected cargoes
using the ACAP1 pathway by determining whether this transport results in their delivery to invadopodia, which
are localized cell-surface structures that concentrate key factors for matrix degradation, a process needed for
cell invasion into tissue. We anticipate that the completion of these studies will not only advance a further
fundamental understanding of endocytic recycling, but also shed new insights into the physiologic roles served
by the ACAP1 pathway."
10830336,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a condition marked by substantial physical and psychological morbidity, is increasingly
diagnosed in youth but is still infrequent even in high-risk obese adolescents. There are significant racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic effects in youth at risk for the development of T2D, but we do not know how to
easily identify which youth will and will not develop T2D, nor do we know specifics about the mechanisms
behind the early development of T2D. To address these research gaps amongst others, we propose an
appropriately powered prospective cohort study of 3500 youth in response to RFA DK-21-002 Understanding
and Targeting the Pathophysiology of Youth-Onset Type 2 Diabetes-Clinical Centers. As the Columbus Clinical
Center (CCC), our interdisciplinary team will leverage our large clinical network in urban and rural settings in
Ohio AND cumulative experience and expertise caring for youth with obesity and type 2 diabetes, recruiting
and retention in prospective clinical/cohort trials and diagnostic testing for diabetes. In addition, we propose
mechanistic studies drawing from our prior studies on insulin sensitivity and secretion, β-cell function, innate
immune response genes, inflammatory markers, and microbiome. As the CCC, we plan to recruit and retain a
cohort of 250 youth aged 9-13 years with obesity (age and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95%tile) with
impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100-125mg/dl) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (140–199mg/dl) in urban
and rural Ohio counties over 30 months and propose. Subjects will be followed to determine the pattern and
trajectory of anthropometric change (weight, BMI, Tanner stage) as risk factors for T2D, and to investigate a
risk phenotype for youth for T2D based on a) social determinants of health, b) lifestyle behaviors and c)
psychosocial factors. Oral glucose tolerance tests will be performed every 6 months to diagnosis diabetes and
also to assess insulin sensitivity and secretion changes that identify early risk for development of T2D.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and hemoglobin A1c levels will also be assessed throughout the study
to identify early markers for development of T2D. Lastly, blood and stool samples will be collected and saved
for future assessment of genetic, inflammatory and microbiome factors that play a mechanistic role in the
development of T2D. The results of this study will have broad clinical and social impact by identifying youth
specifically at risk for T2D and by identifying specific psychosocial risk factors for adolescent T2D. They will
have research impact by identifying mechanistic factors for the development of adolescent T2D that may be
targeted in future interventional studies to prevent the disease."
10757959,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Intestinalization of the esophagus, termed Barrett’s esophagus (BE), is thought to
develop in response to chronic acid and bile reflux and carries great clinical significance because it is the
precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of BE is quite high, estimated to be found in at
least 1:100 people. While relatively few with BE progress to cancer there is great importance to being able to
detect and treat those at risk of progression as EAC is an aggressive cancer with potential for early spread.
Efforts to screen for high-risk disease in those with BE have, to date, not been very successful. Therefore,
there is profound need to define the process by which BE progresses into EAC, to develop biomarkers to
diagnose early progression and assess progression risk in BE tissues as well as to develop novel therapies for
treatment. The objective of this R01 proposal is to investigate the ability of biomarkers to identify BE patients at
high risk of progression. Using results from two externally funded genomic studies in non-dysplastic BE
(NDBE) and BE with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and previously published results, we will compare biomarkers
and determine an optimized combination for risk stratification in two prospective cohorts including patients with
NDBE or LGD. We will then validate our risk stratification assay in an independent US cohort. Finally, we will
compare our genomic biomarker panel results in paired biopsy and brush samples. A unique collaboration
between the PI Dr. Stachler, expert gastroenterologist (Dr. J Bergman), a talented computational biologist (Dr.
CZ Zhang), and an expert biostatistician (Dr. K Zwinderman) along with key collaborators allows a truly
innovated study to be performed. This will be accomplished using an unprecedented collection of clinically
derived samples, a highly optimized targeted sequencing panel, and novel computational approaches that
allow a wide array of information to be determined in a cost effective, clinically relevant manor.
Aim 1: Identify a set of genomic biomarkers highly predictive of progression in biopsies from a
prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with NDBE and LGD and assess whether the addition of
methylation-based biomarkers improves stratification. For clinical implementation all biomarkers should be
compared head to head in order to determine an optimized combination of biomarkers for risk stratification.
Aim 2: Validate the risk stratification assay in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with a baseline
diagnosis of NDBE or LGD. For clinical implementation, it is vital to validate any risk stratification assay on
completely independent cohorts looking at clinically relevant time points.
Aim 3: Determine if brush-based sampling devices improve biomarker detection over standard
endoscopic biopsies. Broad sampling of the BE epithelium may allow for increased rates of detection for
genomic or methylation biomarkers, therefore we will determine if samples from a brushed based device can
better risk stratify patients compared to standard biopsies."
10830913,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Normally, women undergo menopause in their early fifties due to exhaustion of the pool of oocytes called
the “ovarian reserve”. Oocytes are generated in large numbers during embryonic development, but the vast
majority undergo programmed cell death; the remaining oocytes become enclosed within quiescent primordial
follicles that make up the ovarian reserve. Pathologic development of the ovarian reserve leads to infertility or
early reproductive senescence. Furthermore, meiotic errors in oocytes cause germ cell death or result in
developmental defects such as aneuploidy. The molecular signals within the embryonic ovary that determine the
upper and lower limits for oocyte numbers are unknown. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify
signaling pathways that control oogenesis and thus, female reproductive lifespan. The bone morphogenetic
proteins (BMPs) are a large subgroup of the transforming growth factor beta family and have conserved roles in
primordial germ cell specification and development. The BMPs are known morphogens whose activity must be
strictly regulated during development or pathology and disease results. There are a number of secreted
extracellular BMP-binding proteins that act as molecular sinks to negatively regulate the amount of BMP “sensed”
by a signal-receiving cell. Two of these BMP antagonists, GREMLIN-1 and GREMLIN-2 have genetic variants
associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in women. We tested the developmental role of Grem1 and
Grem2 by generating single and double knockout mice for Grem1 and Grem2. These mice display a range of
defects in embryonic ovary development including changes to oocyte number and altered meiosis. The aims of
this proposal are designed to (1) determine how loss of Grem1 and/or Grem2 alters embryonic ovary
development; and (2) determine which signaling pathways are dysregulated in embryonic ovaries of mutant mice
that drive changes in germ cell numbers. Collectively, our studies stand to uncover fundamental mechanism that
regulate embryonic ovary development and oocyte numbers, which are essential for mammalian female
reproduction and reproductive lifespan."
10739821,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of serious respiratory illness and has been responsible for significant
morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. Seasonal IAV infections lead to approximately 200,000
hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually in the United States during non-pandemic years. Furthermore, the
IAV pandemics of 1918 (~50 million deaths worldwide), 1957-58 (~1 million deaths worldwide) and 1968-69
(~700,000 deaths worldwide) further demonstrate the impact of IAV on human health. The recent appearance
of highly pathogenic H5N2 and the Eurasian highly pathogenic avian H5 viruses in the US as well as the high
mortality rate observed in humans infected with the pre-pandemic avian H5N1 (~55-60% mortality rate) IAVs
has heightened concerns. Thus, there has been a renewed interest in developing novel and efficacious
influenza vaccination strategies that confer broad based protection to combat this significant global public
health and pandemic threat. Recent studies have importantly shown that strategies that induce local (i.e. nasal
mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B memory cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the
greatest protection against future heterologous IAV encounters. The currently licensed IAV-vaccines by their
design do not induce lung resident memory T and B cell responses. Thus, our long-term goal is to develop a
protective universal vaccine against pre-pandemic avian IAV that induces lung and nasal resident T and B cells
in addition to systemic immunity. We have developed a polyanhydride nanoparticle based IAV vaccine (IAV-
nanovax) against seasonal IAV that breaks the cold chain, is needle free, and is biocompatible. This IAV-
nanovax has shown efficacy in protection against homologous and heterologous seasonal IAV infections and
the ability to induce T cell and B cell responses in the lungs and nasal passages. The HAs from H5 IAV are
thought to be poorly immunogenic and require higher doses to be effective when compared to HAs from
seasonal IAV thereby limiting vaccine design. Critically, our prior work with polyanhydride nanoparticles has
also shown that they can induce robust immunity even at normally suboptimal levels of antigen. Therefore, this
proposal will use the combined expertise of the PI and Co-Investigators and robust pre-clinical models to
determine if a nanoparticle-based approach will allow for the induction of durable, IAV-specific, lung-resident T
and B cell responses and broad-based protection against homologous and heterologous pre-pandemic avian
IAV strains using the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the efficacy of avian pre-pandemic IAV-nanovax in
inducing robust local and systemic immunity and conferring protection against subsequent H5 IAV exposures,
2) Determine if apIAV-nanovax confers broad-based protection."

degeneration through differentiation into fibrotic and fatty tissue, leading to declining muscle function
which is associated with decreased quality of life and shortened lifespan. While the role of FAPs in
muscle degeneration has been increasingly characterized in the last decade, we have found that certain
stimuli including B-agonism and intermittent ischemia/reperfusion (pre-conditioning) can induce a beige
fat phenotype that promotes muscle regeneration in vitro as well as in vivo. We have shown that
beige-FAPs are capable of mitochondrial transfer which is thought to be a mechanism by which other
stem cells are able to rescue injured cells to promote regeneration. The objective of this project is to
define the role of mitochondrial function and transfer on the ability of FAPs to improve muscle
regeneration. To determine this, begin by defining the mechanisms by which B-agonism can stimulate
FAP mitochondrial transfer. We hypothesize that B-agonism will stimulate FAPs to a beige phenotype
that will promote mitochondrial biogenesis and the formation of tunneling nanotube machinery. We will
next determine the intrinsic properties of FAP mitochondria and impact of FAP-mitochondrial donation
on myogenic cell proliferation, differentiation, and myogenic commitment We hypothesize that beige-
FAPs contain both enhanced mitochondrial numbers, but also increased bioenergetics that promote
muscle stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we will evaluate how B-agonist treatment or
pre-conditioning can stimulate beige-FAPs mitochondrial transfer in vivo to improve outcomes in the
setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The proposed work is important as it will define the mechanism
by which beige-FAPs can promote muscle regeneration. An increased understanding of this
mechanism in vitro and in vivo may assist in the rational design of treatment strategies to improve
muscle degeneration."

The innate immune system employs germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect common
pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, only several PRR signaling pathways, including RIG-I-
MAVS, cGAS-STING, and TLR3/4-TRIF, activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Recent studies showed
that the innate immune adaptors (MAVS, STING, and TRIF) are phosphorylated at their respective C-terminal
consensus motif, pLxIS (p, hydrophilic residue; x, any residue; S, phosphorylation site) by TBK1. The
phosphorylation of the pLxIS motif in innate immune adaptor proteins is an essential and conserved
mechanism that selectively recruits IRF3 to activate type I IFN production. However, whether and how the host
or pathogen utilizes this motif to attenuate or block IRF3 signaling is unknown. Our overall objective in this
application is to determine the role of the cryptochrome (CRY) proteins in IRF3 signaling pathways and host
defense to viral infection. Our preliminary proteomic data showed that cryptochrome (CRY) proteins, CRY1
and CRY2, interacted with IRF3. Interestingly, CRY1 and CRY2 have two and one conserved pLxIE motifs,
respectively. As glutamic acid (E) is a phosphorylation mimic, this pLxIE motif might be a constitutively
phosphorylated pLxIS. Our pilot studies showed that mutation of E to alanine (A) in the pLxIE abolished the
binding to IRF3, suggesting that the pLxIE motif is also a docking site for IRF3. Furthermore, deficiency of both
CRY proteins also augmented IRF3 signaling and type I IFN production. However, how CRY proteins inhibit
innate immune responses is not well elucidated. Based on the existing literature and our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that CRY proteins are decoy adaptors for IRF3 via the pLxIE motif and the binding blocks
interaction between IRF3 and innate immune adaptors, thereby inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.
Aim 1 will determine the role of CRY1/2 in the RIG-I-mediated IRF3 signaling pathway. Aim 2 will dissect the
molecular mechanisms of how CRY1/2 suppresses IRF3-mediated innate immunity.
Many human immune diseases exhibit circadian rhythmicity in their symptoms and pathology, including
asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other disorders of the immune system. Our study will bridge the gaps in
understanding the role of the circadian proteins CRY1/2 in host innate immune response. This novel
mechanism proposed in our application will advance our understanding of the crosstalk between innate
immunity and circadian."
10754941,"Pancreas agenesis (PA) is a developmental disorder characterized by either a reduction or complete lack of
pancreatic mass. Notably, heterozygous loss of GATA6 accounts for >60% of all human pancreas agenesis
cases; however, the pancreatic phenotype within each individual can be incompletely penetrant, ranging from
severe neonatal diabetes to mild adult onset diabetes due to beta cell dysfunction. These findings suggest that
additional genetic modifiers may contribute to the pathogenesis caused by the reduction in GATA6 expression.
During the previous funding period, the collaboration between the Gadue and Sussel labs leveraged the
strengths of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based pancreas differentiation and in vivo murine
models of development to discover robust synergy between GATA6 and retinoic acid (RA) signaling in regulating
several stages of pancreas development. Our findings suggest two novel concepts: (1) an unappreciated role
for RA signaling during endocrine progenitor specification and (2) synergy between RA and specifically GATA6
(but not GATA4) is required to specify beta cells in both mice and humans. The primary goals of this renewal
application are to use these complementary genetic model systems to better define this synergy and elucidate
the mechanisms by which the intersection of RA signaling and GATA6 regulate pancreas development.
Furthermore, we will explore how human mutations in GATA6 disrupt this interaction to influence disease
severity. Our published studies combined with new preliminary data in both the mice and human models has led
us to hypothesize that this conserved synergy between RA signaling and GATA6 gene regulation is
essential for pancreas development and the combined disruption of these pathways contributes to
pancreas and islet cell development. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Establish
the synergistic roles of RA/GATA6 during pancreatic endocrine and β cell development and identify the specific
stages of the hiPSC-derived pancreas differentiation protocol that require a combination of RA signaling and
GATA6 function for optimal beta cell development; 2) Determine the precise molecular mechanism(s) underlying
the intersection of RARa and GATA6 in the regulation gene expression pathways that promote pancreatic islet
differentiation; and 3) Define how patient specific GATA6 disease mutations affect RA/GATA6 synergy and
downstream pathways during pancreas development. The experiments proposed in this application will provide
substantial novel insight into the conserved regulatory pathways that are required for appropriate pancreas
development and islet cell differentiation and will further inform how mutations in GATA6 cause a wide range of
pancreatic phenotypes in humans."
10749039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor currently without any approved targeted
therapies. Inhibitors of the histone demethylase LSD1 are currently in clinical trials in SCLC inspired by strong
preclinical data demonstrating that some SCLCs are highly and selectively sensitive to LSD1 inhibition. However,
only a minority of SCLCs are highly sensitive to LSD1 inhibition, while most SCLCs are inherently resistant. The
molecular basis for why some SCLCs are highly dependent on LSD1 is not understood. Understanding the
causative mechanisms for why some SCLCs are highly sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors could identify predictive
biomarkers to select patients more likely to respond to LSD1 inhibitors or identify rational combination strategies
to make LSD1 inhibitors more effective.
 Using unbiased positive selection CRISPR/Cas9 loss of function screening with LSD1 inhibitors, we have
uncovered novel causative mechanisms by which LSD1 inhibitors regulate SCLC, which include mechanisms
by which LSD1 regulates neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC, target genes that are bound and repressed by
LSD1 and required for LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity, and also identified a rational combination strategy to overcome
resistance to LSD1 inhibitors.
 The broad long-term objective of our proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LSD1
promotes SCLC tumorigenesis and neuroendocrine differentiation (aims 1 and 3), and test a rational combination
strategy to make LSD1 inhibition more effective in SCLC (aim 2). To accomplish this, we will combine in vitro
mechanistic approaches to rigorously dissect the mechanisms by which LSD1 drives SCLC proliferation and
neuroendocrine differentiation with an in vivo autochthonous immunocompetent SCLC genetically-engineered
mouse model (GEMM) that we developed using CRISPR/Cas9 that can be used to delete LSD1 at tumor initiation
and study its function during SCLC tumorigenesis. Using these LSD1 isogenic SCLC GEMMs, we will interrogate
how loss of LSD1 blocks neuroendocrine differentiation, promotes lineage plasticity, and increases tumor
immunogenicity. Together, these studies will provide important biological insights into how SCLCs utilize LSD1
to drive tumorigenesis and neuroendocrine differentiation, which ultimately could lead to the identification of
predictive biomarkers to select patients more likely to respond to LSD1 inhibitors. Lastly, this research could
provide the preclinical foundation for a rational combination therapeutic strategy to make LSD1 inhibitors more
effective for SCLC patients."
10793613,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Intestinal secretory (Sec: goblet (Gob), enteroendocrine (EE), Paneth (Pan), and tuft) cells serve vital
digestive, metabolic, barrier, and other physiologic functions. Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) replenish both
absorptive and Sec epithelial cells, but the origins of Sec diversity and census are largely unknown. Because
it has been difficult to isolate and characterize intermediate precursor cell states, much of the current
understanding of the mouse and human Sec lineages rests on mouse genetic studies. On morphologic and
functional grounds, the four mature Sec cell types are considered distinct and their origins trace to a common
ATOH1-expressing crypt progenitor (Sec-Pro), although some mouse EE and tuft –but not Gob or Pan– cells
arise in the absence of this Sec-specifying transcription factor (TF). Cell fates are generally dictated by cell-
specific cis-regulatory elements (CREs – mainly enhancers) that drive particular transcriptional programs
under the direction of cell-restricted TFs. To understand how primitive Sec-Pro execute subsequent CRE
and cell fate decisions, we have developed two parallel and powerful experimental systems: (1) Capture of
labeled early mouse Sec derivatives in vivo for deep characterization of gene and enhancer activity at single-
cell resolution, and (2) Differentiation of 2D human ISC-like cells in vitro along the full Sec lineage. Both
models yield large numbers of multi- and bi-potential precursors, hence allowing original mechanistic insights
into the corresponding transcriptional and CRE states. Our three Specific Aims integrate findings from the
two parallel models to decipher the epigenetic basis and regulatory TF logic of mouse and human Sec cell
differentiation. Aim 1 uses mRNA and open-chromatin profiles of precursor and descendant Sec cells within
a differentiation continuum to characterize the salient features of specific intermediate states, map previously
unknown TF-driven transitions, distinguish cell-autonomous from -extrinsic factors, and thus derive a unifying
model for mammalian Sec lineage diversity. Considered in the light of scattered published findings, our
preliminary data suggest that Gob and Pan are not genuinely distinct cell types, but different versions of a
versatile Sec end-product where specific local signals act on the same complement of open chromatin to
drive Gob or Pan features. Aim 2 applies a suite of in vitro and in vivo experiments to test specific hypotheses
that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and especially canonical Wnt signaling favor the Pan state, while bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling drives the Gob state. We will examine how alternative recruitment of
Gob- or Pan-selective CREs by specific signaling pathways might underlie these fluid cell states. Aim 3 uses
gain- and loss-of-function strategies to address previously challenging questions about TF-driven
specification of human Sec, especially EE and tuft, cells. Overall, a particular strength of this proposal is the
deeply mechanistic investigation of cell-specific CREs and TFs that together dictate interim and final cell
potential in the murine and human Sec lineage."
10808113,"Severe headache is ubiquitous in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), present in 90% of patients after ictus bleed. Despite steady consumption of analgesics, the degree of pain control in SAH patients is remarkably poor. In spite of this high prevalence, a dearth of data guides optimal management of post-SAH headache. Opioids are the most prescribed pain medication for severe post-SAH headache. However, opioid-based analgesia presents considerable risks: depressed level of consciousness and respiratory drive, hypotension, slow gastrointestinal transit, and high frequency of tolerance and addiction. Furthermore, it is urgent and critical to identify novel strategies to alleviate the excruciating and nearly universal headache post-SAH, while mitigating consequences of opioid use. This unmet therapeutic need reflects a key knowledge gap in a condition afflicting nearly 30,000 individuals each year in the US. We present an inexpensive, opioid-sparing strategy for post-SAH headache, using a nerve-block into the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) to improve pain control and lessen opioid needs. A growing body of literature on the use of nerve-blocks in acute and chronic headache disorders supports our overarching hypothesis that PPF-block provides rapid, opioid-sparing analgesia, is safe and well-tolerated, and holds promise to adequately treat post-SAH headache. The pathophysiology of these headaches is complex and involves meningeal irritation from blood products, release of inflammatory cytokines, vasomotor instability, and central pain sensitization. Through selective modulation, PPF-blocks address pain mechanisms at their origin, targeting the maxillary nerve and sphenopalatine ganglion, including their branches. We propose a multicenter phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study with sequential parallel comparison design of bilateral PPF-injections over 4 days at 12 centers. Following aneurysm treatment, 195 adults hospitalized with aneurysmal SAH, who are experiencing severe headaches and can verbalize pain scores, will be randomized to once daily active (ropivacaine + dexamethasone) or sham (saline) or PPF-injections during the first 2 consecutive days of the intervention period (Day 1/Stage 1, Day 2/Stage 2). The open-label phase spans the subsequent 2 days (Days 3-4), during which subjects may opt to receive an active PPF-block. This two-stage design leverages increased efficiency in data generation from the pooled sequential blinded stages (i.e., Stages 1 & 2) and reduced impact of sham responses, and thus, allows for smaller sample size without compromising statistical power. Our primary objective is to demonstrate the opioid-sparing analgesic effect of PPF-blocks vs sham. Our secondary objective is to assess the tolerability of PPF-injections as measured by rates of acceptance of second injection on Day 2, and their safety as measured by vasospasm rates at the end of the open-label period in patients with SAH. We will also explore the potential interplay of sex and racial disparities in pain experiences and both PPF- block tolerability and efficacy. This initiative merges our expertise in neurosurgery, neurocritical care, and acute- pain-anesthesiology to tackle a historically neglected aspect of the critical care management of SAH."
10923798,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this project is to determine the neuronal and vascular mechanisms of visual impairment
and myopia resulting from prematurity in order to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. Prenatal and
early postnatal vertebrate retinas generate correlated spontaneous neuronal activity, termed “retinal waves,” that
are essential for normal neuronal development and vision. Premature retinal wave termination may contribute to
preterm birth-associated vision problems and refractive errors. Preterm birth, in combination with postnatal oxy-
gen therapy, can also cause retinal vascular complications known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). ROP is
closely associated with incurable visual impairment and myopia in premature infants.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogeneses of eye disorders related to ROP and the
early retinal wave activity termination are not yet well defined. Our objectives in this project are to define how
spontaneous retinal waves mediate ocular growth before visual experience and how oxygen-induced retinopathy
(OIR) causes vision impairment and myopia. Our preliminary data demonstrated that cholinergic retinal waves
generated by starburst amacrine cells (SACs) can excite dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs), the sole source
of ocular dopamine—an ocular development regulator. We hypothesize that cholinergic waves drive normal eye
development via dopamine signaling and that suppression of this pathway will disrupt normal ocular growth. In
Aim 1, we will test this hypothesis by identifying the cholinergic wave–dopamine signaling pathway and
assessing how this pathway impacts ocular growth.
In addition, we have found that, in an OIR animal model, AII amacrine cells (AII-ACs) and DACs—two classes
of inner retinal neurons that contribute to scotopic and photopic vision, respectively—were substantially lost. We
hypothesize that the loss of AII-ACs and DACs in OIR causes myopia. In Aim 2, we will test this hypothesis by
determining the relative contributions of AII-ACs and DACs to OIR-induced myopia and assessing the impact of
OIR-induced visual impairments on myopia development.
Expected outcomes include determining how retinal waves influence dopamine signaling to mediate ocular
growth and how oxygen treatment perturbs the rod and cone signaling systems through the loss of retinal
interneurons to cause vision loss and the development of myopia. The broader impact of this work on
understanding the causes and mechanisms of preterm vision impairment and myopia in children will enable the
rational discovery of new therapeutic interventions."
10795879,"Keratoconus (KC), a common corneal dystrophy that affects young people, causes progressive thinning,
scarring and loss of corneal shape, which can ultimately lead to loss of vision. Crosslinking of collagens in the
cornea can stiffen and delay its weakening, but severe cases require corneal transplantation. Although KC has a
strong genetic component, its etiology is complex, polygenic and multifactorial. There is an urgent need to
understand its etiology for developing early diagnosis and treatment strategies for KC. To address this, our
competitive renewal application focuses on identifying cellular defects, biomarkers and the genetic causes of
KC. Beyond obvious familial KC, the vast majority are isolated where disease likely results from rare pathogenic
coding sequence variants and genome-wide common noncoding variants that increase one's susceptibility.
Elucidating the underlying genetic defects in these “isolated KC” requires a range of biological evidence. Our
recent studies and preliminary data provide this biological foundation for the current proposal. First, by whole-
exome sequencing of KC families, we identified rare pathogenic variants in genes related to cell stress,
cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix (ECM), which are now prioritized as candidate genes and networks for
the isolated KC studies. Second, our transcriptomic and proteomic characterizations of KC and control donor
corneas identified significant dysregulation in the NRF2-antioxidant program that is crucial for corneal cell
survival and its functions. Finally, we developed corneal cell culture models that mimic key KC features, from
oxidative stress to ECM insufficiency, and assays to measure these. We further developed the first cornea
organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells that will allow functional studies of genes and
therapeutic agents in a physiological, cornea-like setting and in organoid-derived epithelial and stromal cell
cultures. Importantly, this approach will yield cell culture disease models from genetically defined patient
blood cells. These cell culture disease surrogates are particularly important, as there are no animal models that
can capture the polygenic complexity of KC. In Aim 1 we will assess potential NRF2-regulated antioxidants as
tear fluid biomarkers for KC, and investigate this network in corneal cell cultures. In Aim 2 we will identify
rare pathogenic variants and common noncoding variants that increase disease susceptibility in isolated KC
cases using the 1000Genome and the UK Biobank databases as controls. In Aim 3 we will functionally test the
concept that a rare pathogenic variant (e.g., our published c.G12982A HSPG2), will cause cellular disease
surrogates when CRISPR-edited into cells derived from KC individuals with high polygenic and not controls
with low polygenic scores. Our findings will lead to potential anti-oxidant biomarkers, development of NRF2-
activators for KC treatments, genetically defined KC cell culture models and insights into the complex genetic
architecture of KC. Our studies are highly relevant to the goals of the NEI in understanding the complex
genetics of eye diseases, treatments and reversing vision loss."
10771198,"The etiology for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), which accounts for >95% of AD cases, is unknown.
Aging is the greatest risk factor for LOAD, whereas APOE4 is believed to be a major genetic risk factor in
acquiring LOAD, with female APOE4 carriers at the greatest risk. Yet, not all of APOE4 carriers, even older
female carriers, acquire AD, suggesting that other factors including environmental exposure must play a role.
Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive oxidant and one of the most abundant urban pollutants. Recent epidemiology
studies show that exposure to high levels of O3 is associated with an increased incidence of AD in the elderly and
that APOE4 carriers are more sensitive to O3-induced memory decline than non-APOE4 carriers are, although
no study has addressed sex-differences in response to O3. In an R21 project, we tested the hypothesis that O3
exposure synergies with aging and APOE4 leading to AD, using male apoE4 target replacement (TR) mice (only
male mice were proposed due to time and budget limitation). We found, surprisingly, that O3 exposure impaired
memory in old apoE3 (represents the majority of human population who carry the APOE3 allele) male mice,
while old apoE4 or young apoE3 and apoE4 male mice were spared 6. Associated with memory loss, old apoE3
male mice exhibit increased protein oxidative modifications (glutathionylation) and neuroinflammation,
compared to other groups6. Old apoE4 male mice, on the other hand, have significantly increased
expression/activities of several antioxidant enzymes and diminished protein oxidation as well as
neuroinflammation upon O3 exposure6. Our data suggest that an elevated antioxidant capacity may underlie the
increased resistance of old male apoE4 mice to O3-induced memory loss. Our data also suggest that APOE4
may affect the sensitivity to O3-induced memory loss in a sex-dependent manner, just as it does to the toxicities
of other toxicants. This R01 will continue our R21 project to further test sex-dependent effects of ApoE4 and
O3. As oxidative stress plays a critical role in AD pathophysiology and plasma level of estrogen, an inducer of
many antioxidant enzymes, decreases with age in females, our new data-supported hypothesis is that O3
exposure synergizes with aging and APOE4 leading to LOAD in sex-dependent manner, which is to
promote AD in females but not in males. We will test this hypothesis in two specific Aims, using apoE3 and
apoE4 TR mice and a cyclic O3 exposure protocol, which mimics human exposure scenarios. In Aim 1, we will
test the hypothesis that O3 exposure induces AD-like pathophysiology in female apoE4 TR mice compared to
their male counterparts and this is exacerbated by aging. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that restoration of
brain antioxidant capacity with tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), a canonical activator of nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), will eliminate sex-APOE genotype-aging-dependent sensitivity to O3-induced
neuropathophysiology. The results from these studies will not only shed new light on the etiology of LOAD but
may also lead to the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of this devastating disease."
10809000,"Project Summary
Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes are causative in Lynch Syndrome (LS) and defective MMR
drives tumorigenesis in a significant proportion (15 - 20%) of sporadic colorectal cancers. The loss of MMR not
only increases genomic mutation rates, but also results in the resistance of tumors to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents. To study the how the loss of MMR causes colorectal tumorigenesis and affects the
response of intestinal tumors to treatment we developed a novel mouse line, termed VCMsh2Thu, carrying a
“humanized” TgfβRII allele (Thu) that is susceptible to coding frameshift mutations during MMR-driven intestinal
tumorigenesis. VCMsh2Thu is the first mouse model that develops colorectal cancers (CRCs) closely mimicking
the histopathologic features of CRCs in LS patients. In preliminary studies, we found that while rapamycin only
had a cytostatic effect on MMR-proficient (MMR+) CRC cell lines, it exerted a strong cytotoxic effect on MMR-
deficient (MMR-) CRC cell lines. Importantly, rapamycin treatment induced the rapid and persistent regression
of MMR(-) small and large intestinal tumors in our LS mouse models as well as of three MMR(-) patient-derived
CRC xenografts (PDXs), but not of MMR(+) CRC PDXs. Interestingly, mutations in oncogenes such as KRAS
or PI3KCA and tumor suppressor genes including APC or TRP53 so far did not affect the rapamycin response
in these PDX models. The striking response of MMR(-) tumors was due to the failure to efficiently repair
rapamycin-induced oxidative DNA damage, which resulted in autophagic cell death of differentiated tumor
cells. We also observed that MMR(-) tumors contain treatment resistant “cancer stem cell niches” consisting of
Lgr5+ and Bmi1+ cancer stem cells (CSCs) as well as Paneth cells that accumulate during rapamycin
treatment. Importantly, preliminary studies in MMR(-) CRC organoids showed that rapamycin is effectively
exported from CSCs and that inhibition of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp) could provide a novel strategy
for their elimination. In addition, similar to CRCs in human patients, the CRCs in VCMsh2Thu mice are
characterized by increased expression of the stem cell marker Aldh1a3, suggesting an important role for
Aldh1a3+ CSCs in MMR- tumorigenesis. A novel Aldh1a3-Cre knock-in allele (AC) allows us to inactivate MMR
in Aldh1a3+ stem cells and study the effects on intestinal tumorigenesis and the rapamycin response. Based
on these findings, in this application we propose to study the effect of mTOR inhibition on the prevention and
treatment of CRCs in VCMsh2Thu preclinical mice and a panel of clinically well-annotated MMR(-) PDX models.
In addition, we will test a novel strategy involving P-gp inhibition for the elimination of CSCs in MMR(-) mouse
and human CRCs. Finally, we will perform an unbiased analysis of the CSC populations that persist during
rapamycin treatment in mouse and human MMR(-) CRCs by single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) analysis."
11077602,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) will become the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths in the
United States by 2030. Most patients with PDA present with nonresectable/metastatic disease, and systemic
chemotherapy is the anchoring treatment in these patients. Surgery is an option in the minority of patients (~30%)
who present with localized disease, though most develop early recurrence after a highly morbid surgery due to
occult metastases. Therefore, neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is an emerging standard approach, but is only
beneficial if the selected systemic therapy is effective. Indeed, for all patients with PDA, metastatic or otherwise,
the duration of effective systemic therapy is the most important factor in their survival. There is a critical unmet
need for accurate and timely assessment of treatment response in order to 1) get patients on effective systemic
therapy as soon as possible and keep them on it as long as possible, 2) expeditiously discontinue toxic, costly
and ineffective therapies, and 3) facilitate evidence-based personalized clinical decisions regarding curative-
intent surgery. Current management of PDA relies principally on computed tomography (CT) and tumor markers
(CA19-9). However, these tools are not sensitive enough and are too slow for adjudicating benefit in patients
with rapidly lethal metastatic disease, and for identifying suitable candidates most likely to benefit from surgery
after NAT. We now have cutting-edge tools for more precise quantification of disease burden at the molecular
and metabolic levels. We have previously shown that mutant KRAS circulating tumor (ct)DNA can be detected
with high sensitivity in PDA, tends to drop rapidly with effective therapy, and may be a more dynamic predictor
of therapy response than CA19-9. We have also shown that metabolic imaging with hybrid integrated 18-fluoro-
deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) improves the
detection of subtle metastases that are occult on CT, early response assessment in patients with
nonresectable/metastatic PDA, and prediction of pathological response to NAT in patients who undergo
resection. Building on these promising results, we hypothesize that the appropriate combination of KRAS ctDNA
and PET/MRI biomarkers will enable timely assessment of the clinical utility of therapy in PDA patients. In Aim
1, we will define thresholds for early chemotherapy switch in unresectable/metastatic PDA using dynamic and
quantitative changes in KRAS ctDNA and FDG PET/MRI biomarkers for use in future prospective trials. In Aim
2, we will construct, test and validate a model of surgical benefit or futility for patients with potentially resectable
PDA using dynamic KRAS ctDNA and FDG PET/MRI response data. Our overarching goal is to integrate reliable
biomarkers that can accurately guide therapy and enable precision medicine to improve outcomes of patients
with this deadly disease."
10808916,"Abstract
CD8 T lymphocytes are the major mechanism by which the immune system eliminates cancers and virally
infected cells. CD8 T cells detect these abnormal targets by recognizing immunogenic peptides displayed on
MHC I molecules. Cancers and viruses can evade immune control by inhibiting MHC I antigen presentation,
making it harder for CD8 T lymphocytes to detect and kill these pathological cells. Therefore, it is important to
understand the mechanisms that regulate antigen presentation as well as the mechanisms by which tumors
dysregulate these processes - this is the overall goal of this proposal. Our proposal is based on our discovery in
an unbiased forward genetic screen of a Tetraspanin (Tspan5) that unexpectedly organizes MHC I molecules in
ways that amplify theair ability to stimulate CD8 T cell responses. Our 1st aim will elucidate the underlying
molecular mechanisms for this biological effect. This Aim will test the hypothesis that Tspan5 organizes MHC I
molecules into stimulatory membrane microdomains that by virtue of size, MHC I density and/or incorporation of
other key ligands markedly increases the efficiency of antigen presentation. Our 2nd aim will elucidate how, when
and where Tspan5-MHC I microdomains form. This aim will test the hypotheses that peptide-MHC I complexes
are incorporated into Tspan5 immunostimulatory microdomains upon release from the peptide-loading complex
in the ER, through specific molecular interactions with Tspan5 and other Tspan family members, and then these
immunostimulatory microdomains are trafficked to and maintained on the plasma membrane for display. Our 3rd
Aim is based on our finding that certain cancers, including renal cell carcinomas, significantly downregulate
Tspan 5 expression. The hypothesis underlying our 3rd Aim is that this loss of expression of Tspan5 is one of the
ways that cancers escape immune surveillance and control and thereby progress. A corollary of this hypothesis
is that the loss of Tspan5 is a mechanism that will influence resistance to immunotherapy; as such, Tspan5 could
provide a much-needed biomarker for identifying patients who will not respond to immunotherapy and could also
be a potential therapeutic target to restore responses to such therapy. Our experimental approach will use
isogenic Tspan5-edited renal cell cancers (loss of function and gain of function) in preclinical models with
humanized and wild type mice to define the role of Tspan5 in tumor immune evasion and responsiveness to
immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade for both human and mouse tumors. Finally, we will translate these
findings into human cancer patients by investigating whether Tspan5 expression is a biomarker that can predict
clinical course. Our hypotheses and feasibility of the proposed experiments are supported by strong preliminary
data. Taken together, our proposed experiments will go from basic mechanistic studies, which will elucidate a
potentially fundamental and novel mechanism for optimizing the ability of APCs to stimulate T cell responses, to
preclinical and clinical studies, which will define how loss of this mechanism affects immune control of cancers
and clinical outcomes."
10807104,"ABSTRACT Virus-specific CD8 T cells exert antiviral activity against HIV-1/SIV in vitro and in vivo. Yet, despite
these responses in HIV-1-infected humans and SIV- infected macaques, they are unable to fully suppress virus
replication. This is likely due to the majority viral replication occurring in CD4+ T cells within B-cell follicles in
secondary lymphoid tissues; where virus-specific CD8 T cells are relatively few in number. In fact, we found that
in vivo effector virus-specific CD8 T cell to target SIV RNA+ cell ratios (E:T) were over 40-fold lower inside
compared to outside of B cell follicles in lymphoid tissues. These findings indicate that B cell follicles are an
immune privileged site in which low levels of virus-specific CD8 T cells permit ongoing viral replication.
Furthermore, we found that few virus-specific CD8 T cells express the follicular homing molecule CXCR5, likely
explaining their low levels in B cell follicles. These data suggest that the inability of virus specific CD8 T cells to
fully suppress virus replication may be due to a deficiency of these T cells in B-cell follicles. These findings have
led us to our central hypothesis that targeting HIV-specific immunotherapy to B cell follicles will lead to durable
remission of HIV infection. In support of this hypothesis we have shown that increased levels of virus-specific
CD8 T cells in B cell follicles is associated with lower viral loads. Although many immunotherapies utilize patient
T cells to generate CAR-T therapies, there are special consideration in the treatment of HIV. One major short
comings of CAR-T approaches is the fact that T cells need to be autologous due to the risk of graft versus host
disease (GvHD), requiring complicated/expensive manufacturing processes of patient cells. This is also
challenging in the HIV setting as the patient T cells are already compromised and processing cells which may
contain active virus is risky. Alternatively, Natural Killer (NK) cells are highly suited for allogeneic use as they do
not cause GvHD and thus hold significant clinical potential as an off-the-shelf cellular product. Thuts, we propose
to evaluate NK immunotherapy that targets virus-specific CAR NK cells (expressing CD4-MBL-CAR and CXCR5)
to B cell follicles. Moreover, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout negative regulators of NK cell function, such
as PD1, which we have previously shown to enhance NK cell function. Our long-term goal is to develop an
intervention that will lead to durable remission of HIV infection using CAR NK cells. To test our hypotheses, we
propose the following aims. 1) Develop reagents and methods to generate human and rhesus macaque
CAR/CXCR5/PD1KO NK cells. 2) Determine the ability of CAR/CXCR5/PD1KO NK cells to migrate into B cell
follicles of SIV-infected rhesus macaques and to induce and maintain viral suppression. Our proposed studies
targeting CAR NK cells to follicles will have a broad impact on the field by providing insights into cell trafficking,
persistence, and pre-conditioning regimens for NK immunotherapy. Moreover, our methods for engineering
rhesus macaque NK cells will enable studies assessing the therapeutic use of NK cells in preclinical NHP models.
Moreover, these studies could result in an effective strategy to induce long-term sustained remission of HIV."

 2 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the United States and its impact is only growing with
 3 shifting demographics. The development of powerful biomarkers, measuring amyloid deposition, tau accumulation,
 4 and neurodegeneration, has provided important insights into the pathophysiology of AD and AD-related dementias
 5 (ADRD). Nonetheless, given the large variability across individuals, our understanding of the link between pathology
 6 and cognitive dysfunction remains incomplete. Structural factors contribute significantly to this pathology-cognition
 7 disconnect and are termed as “brain reserve.” There is a critical need for objective measures of reserve that will
 8 improve the assessment of individual prognosis and guide therapy.
 9 Brain biomechanics are an understudied structural feature of the brain, due in large part to the difficulty in measuring
10 relevant biomechanical states in vivo. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is currently unmatched for
11 noninvasive measurement of brain mechanical properties. We have previously demonstrated that brain stiffness is
12 reduced due to AD, and our group and others have demonstrated in multiple studies that brain stiffness is a significant
13 reporter of cognitive function. However, previous studies face important limitations, namely technologies that were
14 optimized for reliability over resolution, and incomplete pathological assessment. Therefore, we will investigate two
15 aims with the overall goals to (1) advance MRE technology in order to (2) evaluate of the role of biomechanics in
16 brain reserve.
17 In Aim 1, we will optimize our machine learning-based MRE inversion framework by incorporating new a priori
18 information into the model that is specific to the brain. These advances to the model include the incorporation of
19 partial volume effects to reduce atrophy-related bias, and mechanical anisotropy to accurately model the coherent
20 structure of white matter tracts. Each advance will be tested in simulation and phantom experiments, and finally in
21 vivo for its ability to boost sensitivity to key AD/ADRD processes.
22 In Aim 2, we will use these tools to simultaneously map the mechanical signature of 4 pathophysiological processes
23 including amyloid, tau, white matter hyperintensities, and cardiometabolic conditions. Using first a discovery data set,
24 we will extract the mechanical feature that best reports cognitive performance, both globally and in specific domains.
25 These MRE-based features will then be evaluated in an independent test set for their ability to predict concurrent and
26 future cognitive performance. Finally, we will assess the unique value of mechanical biomarkers to predict cognitive
27 performance, using a parallel analysis but controlling for existing biomarkers derived from anatomical, functional, and
28 diffusion MRI.
29 In sum, the success of this proposal will shed new light on alterations to brain biomechanics with respect to
30 AD/ADRD processes, and their role as a buffer between pathology and cognition."
10585513,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a family of conditions characterized by chronic, relapsing
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is especially prominent amongst military veteran populations,
with one of the highest hospitalization rates of tracked diseases (>100,000 hospitalizations from 1975-2006)
and accompanying high rates of hospital readmission. A recent study of the incidence of IBD in the veteran
population has found that the incidence of IBD is 2-10 times greater than non-service members, showing a
high degree of correlation with life stressors, and is on the increase in certain populations. Although treatments
for IBD do exist, they are plagued by imperfections such as debilitating side effects (e.g., immunosuppression)
and loss in effectiveness over time. Development of novel therapeutics is hampered by a poor understanding
of the molecular mechanisms of IBD pathogenesis; consequently, a need exists to better understand the
molecular pathophysiology of IBD to inform the development of novel therapies.
 One of the major molecular pathways associated with IBD is macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as
autophagy. Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic system wherein intracellular contents are recycled through
the lysosome. Autophagy genes have been identified as IBD risk factors, and defects in autophagy have been
experimentally shown to confer greater susceptibility to colitis in animal models. However, a complete
understanding of the mechanism by which autophagy regulates IBD disease susceptibility is not known.
Importantly, however, defects in autophagy appear to compromise normal host-microbe interactions at the
intestinal interface by decreasing anti-microbial autophagy (“xenophagy”).
 Preliminary studies from our group have implicated autophagy in the proper function of intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs). ChIP-chip analysis of hypoxia-treated IEC showed that several autophagy genes
contained hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. HIF is a
family of transcription factors responsible for the cellular response to low oxygen tensions and previously
shown to be essential for intestinal homeostasis. These data also suggest that autophagy genes are
transcribed preferentially by the HIF-1α isoform, as opposed to HIF-2α. In addition, hypoxia treatment of IECs
increased autophagic flux in vitro, suggesting an increase in functional autophagy to hypoxia stimulation in
addition to a transcriptional response. Finally, knockdown of HIF-1α increased susceptibility to the model
intracellular bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium, suggesting a functional role for HIF in regulating xenophagy.
Based on these and ongoing studies, we hypothesize that HIF-1α promotes xenophagy in the intestinal
epithelium to regulate host-microbe interactions.
 To test this hypothesis, we propose three distinct but interrelated specific aims. We first propose to
characterize epithelial HIF-dependency of autophagy responses (Aim 1) using loss- and gain-of-function
mutants. We will further elucidate the importance of HIF in xenophagic response to bacteria (Aim 2) using in
vitro and in vivo infection models in the presence and absence of functional HIF. Finally, we plan to describe
the role of host and microbial metabolites in the regulation of HIF-driven autophagy (Aim 3) by assessing the
influence of differentially regulated metabolites on HIF-regulated xenophagy.
 In addition to these research goals, this proposal outlines the steps I will take towards becoming an
independent, VA-funded investigator. These steps include execution of a mentorship plan overseen by a VA-
funded investigator (Dr. Sean Colgan) with an excellent research and mentoring track record, participation in
prestigious national conferences, and supplementation with courses chosen to complement my in-person
training. At the conclusion of this project, I will be well-positioned to undertake independent, VA-funded
research in the fields of autophagy, intestinal epithelial biology, and host-microbe interactions."
10769811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescence is typically defined as the transition period between childhood and adulthood. It is a critical period
for neural changes, including maturation of the brain’s cognitive networks, but also a period of increased
vulnerability to psychopathology. It is well accepted that the brain is functionally organized into multiple
interacting networks and extensive literature has demonstrated that the spatial and functional organization of
these networks shows major age-related changes across the lifespan, but particularly during adolescence. Yet,
there is currently no reference functional brain atlas derived from typically-developing adolescents, which is
especially problematic as the reliable and reproducible identification of functional brain networks crucially
depends on the use of such reference functional atlases. Furthermore, the use of atlases derived from adults
may undermine the validity and reliability of developmental neuroimaging research. Using preliminary data for
this application and previous works, we show that an age-appropriate functional brain atlas will improve the
characterization of the brain functional connectome and its links to neuropsychiatric traits in youth. In this
context, the aim of this application is to construct and validate the first reference functional brain atlas in
typically-developing youth between the age of 8 and 17 years. To achieve this, we will use resting-state
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the three largest developmental neuroimaging datasets. Our first aim (Aim 1) is
to generate a reference atlas, called “Dev-Atlas”, using the rs-fMRI datasets from approximately 2,000 youths.
We will then (Aim 2) demonstrate the replicability of Dev-Atlas in two independent large samples of typically-
developing youth (Dev-Cog: n=230; Dev-MIND: n=310), collected at Boys Town National Research Hospital
and the Mind Research Network. Because girls, on average, enter puberty one to two years earlier than boys,
we will test (Aim 3) whether girls show brain network differences compared to boys. In the event of significant
sex differences, we will create the first sex-specific functional brain atlases for youth. Finally, we will
demonstrate the superiority of network connectivity features derived from Dev-Atlas compared to atlases
based on data from adults in predicting a greater amount of the variance in psychiatric traits (Aim 4). The
successful completion of this project will provide the first reliable functional brain atlas for youth aged 8-17
years old, which will be made freely available to the research community. By mapping the brain functional
connectome underlying childhood and adolescence, this work has the potential to elucidate how brain network
dysfunction contributes to psychiatric traits and the risk for mental health disorders in adolescence."
10745923,"Each year in the U.S., ≥20,000 women and 14,000 men are affected by HPV-related cancers, including
cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. However, in 2020, only 59% of U.S. adolescents aged 13-17 were up-to-
date for HPV vaccination, and rates for 11-12 year olds, the primary target age group for HPV vaccination
(when the immune reaction is better and before exposure to HPV infection), are even lower. Standing orders
(written protocols that authorize designated members of the healthcare team to vaccinate without first obtaining
a patient-specific physician order) have been shown to work in inpatient settings and for adults, but have not
been evaluated for HPV vaccine, which some parents consider controversial. Also, the ways in which
organizational readiness for change (resources, motivation, staff attributes, leadership support and culture)
moderate the effect of standing orders has not been studied. A physician’s recommendation is correlated with
HPV vaccine acceptance, and we have developed a successful online, interactive, communication education
program that will be adapted to train nurses and staff in addition to physicians. We propose testing standing
orders for HPV vaccine in an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) in Western New York, and assessing
which provider and practice factors moderate the effect of standing orders. Advantages of this setting include a
diverse group of rural, urban and suburban practices, and the ACO provides data infrastructure and analytics
that allow practices to evaluate vaccination rates in real time. Our aims are: Aim 1: Apply mixed methods (in-
depth interviews and practice surveys) to identify provider- and practice-level barriers and facilitators to
implementing SOs for adolescent HPV vaccination; Aim 2: Using a 2-arm cluster randomized trial (n=40
practices), we will assess the effectiveness of standing orders (SO) + HPV communication education
(intervention arm) relative to HPV communication education alone (control arm) on HPV vaccination for 11-17
year-olds. A secondary aim is to measure the implementation of SOs using semi-structured interviews and
surveys; Aim 3: Measure costs and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. If successful, this study will add a
deep understanding of how to make SOs effective to raise HPV vaccination rates."
10791861,"Elucidating the signaling pathways that control angiogenesis allows new therapies to be designed for treatment
of diseases where blood vessels are contributors, including blindness, inflammation, and cancer. Notch1
signaling generally acts as a negative regulator of angiogenic sprouting. We hypothesize that Notch4, a Notch
receptor primarily expressed in endothelium, has both overlapping roles with Notch1 and distinct endothelial
functions. We demonstrated that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis and possibly inflammation of blood vessels and
surrounding cells. By removing Notch4 expression in blood vessels of mice or blocking Notch4 using an inhibitor,
we discovered that Notch4 promotes angiogenesis in the developing retina. Notch4 is expressed in blood vessels
of many types of tumors and we demonstrated that blocking Notch4 inhibits tumor growth when Notch4 is in
tumor vessels. We found that endothelial Notch4 appears to function to alter both vessels and adjacent stromal
tissue. Analysis of Notch4-regulated genes led us to discover that specific cytokine signaling proteins are
regulated by Notch4, and not Notch1, a possible mechanism for Notch4 broad influence on both vessels and
surrounding tissue. In these studies, we will define the unique signaling mechanisms regulated by Notch4 to
understand how Notch4 promotes developmental, inflammatory-driven, and tumor angiogenesis and evaluate
anti-Notch4 treatment for therapeutic benefit. We will use a new technique called CUT&RUN to see which genes
are directly activated by Notch4 or Notch1 and use a novel RiboFlag translational analysis to understand
expression control by each Notch protein. We will determine if newly discovered Notch4-regulated proteins
promote angiogenesis and inflammation in cultured endothelial cells and remove Notch4 expression from
endothelial cells in mice to determine if this causes reduced blood vessel growth, reduces the response to
inflammation and reduces tumor growth. We will separately remove Notch1 or Notch4 genes from endothelium
or remove both genes and describe result of Notch loss on developmental and pathological angiogenesis,
establishing unique and overlapping roles for these genes. A new Notch inhibitor allows us to investigate pre-
clinical therapeutic potential for treatment of proliferative retinopathy, an inflammatory eye disease, and in tumors
that have Notch4 in the endothelial cells. We will investigate the stromal changes in tumors caused by genetic
or pharmacologic blockade of Notch4 using flow cytometry and focused single cell RNA sequencing. In all of
these studies, we will determine if select cytokines are regulated by Notch4 in healthy and disease-associated
blood vessels, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms by which Notch4 impacts inflammation of blood
vessels and surrounding tissue or tumor. Our goals for this proposal will be to discover the unique ways that
Notch4 works to build normal blood vessels and contributes to diseased vessels, and to evaluate therapeutic
strategies to prevent blindness caused by excess angiogenesis, reduce vascular inflammation, and block tumors."
10843871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ability to discriminate between what is “good” and “bad” is termed valence
processing, and pathological perturbations in valence processing can explain mental
health disorders ranging from anxiety and depression to compulsivity and bipolar
disorder. The key to developing more effective treatments for mental health disorders
with fewer side-effects will be in the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms.
This proposal not only lays out a very specific research plan to probe the functional role
of a neuropeptide, neurotensin (NT), but it also lays out a comprehensive, systematic
approach to investigating neuromodulatory systems.
The general approach includes: 1) Identify a circuit that plays a causal and critical role
in valence processing, 2) Profile the transcriptome of this circuit component, 3) Select
for surface receptors or other druggable targets, 4) Determine the contribution of this
neuromodulatory signal on plasticity, 5) Establish the input-output architecture of the
neuromodulatory innervation and postsynaptic, downstream targets, and 6) Establish
a causal role for this particular neuromodulatory signal in neural activity and behavior
associated with valence processing.
The specific hypotheses included in this proposal are: that NT serves to guide plasticity
to the appropriate target, that there are parallel circuits that have some local interaction
in the BLA, and that NT alters the coding dynamics by increasing signal-to-noise ratio
by amplifying signal by modulation of glutamatergic transmission.
A successful outcome of this project will provide a specific model for how a
neuromodulatory signal such as NT can solve the “valence assignment problem.”"
10811613,"Project Summary
 Osteoporosis and low bone mass are common chronic disorders associated with significant morbidity and
substantial healthcare costs. Bone is a dynamic tissue that constantly undergoes coupled remodeling by
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Bone marrow (BM) adipocytes, arising from the same mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) as osteoblasts, also play a crucial role in bone homeostasis. Therefore, advancing our knowledge on
mesenchymal populations in bone and understanding their functions will reveal novel targets that address the
unmet clinical need for improved treatments for skeletal diseases. By carrying out large scale single cell
transcriptome analysis, we recently computationally defined the hierarchy of BM mesenchymal lineage cells
and delineated the in vivo differentiation process of MSCs through multiple intermediate subpopulations.
Interestingly, we identified a new subpopulation situated after proliferative mesenchymal progenitors and
before classic lipid-laden adipocytes (LiLAs) along the adipogenic differentiation route, and thus named those
cells marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs). These non-proliferative cells express mature adipocyte
markers, including Adiponectin (Adipoq), but do not accumulate lipid. In young mice, MALPs, genetically
labelled by Adipoq-Cre(ER), exist abundantly as BM stromal cells and capillary pericytes. Morphologically, they
display many long cell processes that make contacts among themselves and with surrounding cells, as well as
the bone surface, to establish a ubiquitous 3D network inside BM cavity. Cell ablation revealed that these
Adipoq+ cells play critical roles in maintaining BM vasculature and in suppressing bone formation. Strikingly,
MALPs are rapidly and transiently expanded after focal radiation, implying a reparative role during injury
response. One important feature of MALPs is that they highly express many secreted factors, such as VEGFa,
RANKL (Tnfsf11), CSF1, Cxcl12 etc, indicating regulatory actions on surrounding cells. These data lead to our
central hypothesis that MALPs represent a novel adipose cell type with pivotal roles in regulating their BM
environment during skeletal development, homeostasis, aging, and injury repair. Bone marrow adipose tissue
(MAT) normally refers to LiLAs, and current MAT research centers on their energy and lipid-related roles. This
proposal will expand the concept of MAT to include MALPs, a much more abundant cell population, and its
non-lipid-associated actions. Our aims are to: 1) determine the in vivo fate and properties of MALPs; 2)
elucidate the role of MALPs in regulating bone marrow vasculature; 3) determine the regulatory actions of
MALPs on bone resorption. Innovative approaches, such as single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq),
confocal 3D imaging, RNA FISH, genetically modified and reporter animal models, will be used throughout the
proposal. Our project will comprehensively characterize a novel mesenchymal subpopulation and its
multifaceted regulatory roles in bone. The data we gather here will shed new light on bone, adipose, and
vascular biology and identify new targets of intervention on osteoporosis and bone repair."
10789914,"Staphylococcus aureus is an aggressive antibiotic-resistant human bacterial pathogen. S. aureus is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity, mortality, and hospital-associated infection in the U.S., and a formidable health threat worldwide. The only durable solution to mitigate S. aureus disease is the successful development of a universal vaccine. In spite of the clinical burden of human S. aureus infection, and considerable molecular knowledge of disease pathogenesis gleaned from experimental systems, there is a striking paucity of knowledge regarding the host immune response in human S. aureus infection. This fact has remained the single most significant shortcoming of prior vaccine approaches, as the scientific premise for the inclusion of vaccine antigens has not been based on known correlates of human immunity to S. aureus. The investigators’ studies to date in the pediatric population strongly suggest that the adaptive immune response to S. aureus is templated early in life when initial exposure to the organism occurs, amplifying the importance of understanding the development of the human adaptive immune response to S. aureus during infancy and early childhood. The proposed project addresses current knowledge gaps through a multifaceted analysis of the natural development of protective immunity to S. aureus, leveraging novel insight on the role of S. aureus α-toxin (Hla) as a virulence factor that dampens the antigen-specific T cell response in the host. Coupled with the observation that the serologic response to Hla is a correlate of long-term protective immunity to S. aureus in children, these findings suggest that neutralizing Hla may simultaneously afford disease protection and preclude modulation of host immunity by S. aureus. To this end, a cohort-based approach for comparative analysis of human immunity in the context of normal, healthy childhood development, as well as in the setting of S. aureus disease, will be performed. The context of this exposure is expected to elicit protective immunologic responses or maladaptive responses, which we hypothesize will be discernable through paired analyses of healthy and infected subjects as a function of development. These studies will be the first to leverage high-dimensionality mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based analysis of the human T cell response to S. aureus, characterizing both cellular differentiation and the functional response. Paired with multiplex analysis of the developing human antibody response to S. aureus virulence factors, the biorepository generated through the proposed study will support a comparative analysis of adaptive immunity in healthy infants and young children relative to that observed in patients who manifest both local and invasive S. aureus infection. The proposed multi-disciplinary team is uniquely positioned to conduct the first highly-focused, hypothesis-driven approach to examination of the development of human immunity to S. aureus. This research will inform our understanding of the natural development of the host response to S. aureus, providing an essential foundation for the strategic design and implementation of a S. aureus vaccine capable of eliciting population-level immunity."

An estimated 45,230 individuals were diagnosed with rectal cancer in the United States in 2021. Rectal cancer
is primarily managed using a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Surgical resection of the
rectum is associated with long-term functional deficits and decreased quality-of-life. Therefore, strategies to
improve response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy could increase non-surgical curative rates and enhance
quality-of-life for rectal cancer patients. Carbon monoxide (CO) at low, non-toxic concentrations has been shown
to provide paradoxical anti-tumor effects while inhibiting inflammation and oxidative-stress induced normal tissue
injury that could serve as an adjuvant treatment to enhance chemo-radiotherapy efficacy. CO is a product of
heme catabolism regulated by the Nrf2 transcription factor and the cytoprotective gene Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-
1). The biochemical mechanisms by which CO simultaneously sensitizes tumor cells to die while preserving
normal cell survival are unknown but likely involve fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism between
cancer and normal cells. Identifying targetable redox sensitive mechanisms underlying the activity of CO in rectal
cancer could rapidly lead to translational therapeutic approaches for improving radiation responses in cancers
while limiting normal tissue injury. We have developed exciting new methods for CO delivery through the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract to overcome the challenges of inhaled CO. Using these GI formulations to deliver CO,
our central hypothesis is that CO, delivered as a safe biofoam, selectively chemo-radio-sensitizes rectal
cancer while reducing normal tissue injury. Further that the mechanism involves differential effects on
Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and modulation of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. We will evaluate the impact of
cytoprotective CO biofoams on normal rectal tissue responses and oxidative damage after exposure to
chemoradiotherapy and determine the effects of CO as an adjunct to therapy for rectal cancer in mice."
10738765,"Candida auris has emerged as a global threat causing serious invasive infections with mortality approaching
nearly 60 percent worldwide. The majority of C. auris infections are nosocomial and reportedly resistant to
fluconazole (FLU) and amphotericin B (AmB) with variable resistance to members of the three major classes of
clinically available antifungals (azoles, polyenes, echinocandins), with some strains resistant to all three
antifungal classes, thereby limiting treatment options. C. auris has been classified as a ‘newly emerging threat’
by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), although Candida albicans remains the most prevalent and
pathogenic Candida species. With C. auris classified as a global urgent threat, and Candida spp. and other
resistant fungal species emerging, there is a need to identify and develop new modalities to treat infections
caused by Candida spp. Because C. auris colonizes the skin and acts as a nidus of infection, developing
a drug that can concurrently target skin and exhibit systemic efficacy will be highly innovative and
desirable.
A triterpenoid class of antifungals derived from enfumafungin, a hemiacetal isolated from fermentation of
Hormonema spp. (generically termed fungerps), represents the first newly described class of antifungal
compounds since 2001. Currently, a second-generation fungerp, SCY-247, is under development as a potential
systemic therapeutic option. Because the skin is a natural niche for C. auris, and transmission occurs through
cutaneous contact, demonstrating that SCY-247, in addition to working systemically (including at the
blood brain barrier), is effective as a cutaneous (i.e., decolonization) treatment for C. auris is innovative.
We hypothesize that our preclinical models of systemic and cutaneous C. auris infection, will allow us to
demonstrate the efficacy of SCY-247 as a new therapeutic treatment for skin as well as disseminated infection
including brain infection. Thus, our multi-pronged approach includes three specific aims designed to: 1)
Determine the effective in vitro and in vivo range of SCY-247 that is inhibitory/fungicidal to Candida
strains resistant to traditional antifungal therapy with an emphasis on C. auris strains; and 2) Employ
established cutaneous guinea pig and murine models of C. auris to address treatment and
decolonization approaches using SCY-247, and finally; 3) Determine the efficacy of SCY-247 in the
treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by C. auris or C. albicans spp. using an
intracranial murine model and high-resolution intravital microscopy (IVM). Successful completion of these
aims will determine whether SCY-247 is a viable option for eradication of C. auris, and whether this compound
is effective against known resistant Candida spp. We will evaluate both oral and I.V. dosing of SCY-247
comparing their potential efficacy. Finally, the ability of SCY-247 to treat C. auris brain infection will be assessed.
Successful completion of these preclinical studies will enable advancing SCY-247 into Phase 1 clinical trials."
10754572,"Although the CDC's 2019 report on Antibiotic Resistance Threats in U.S. shows that methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cases have declined, nearly 85% of all deaths attributed to antibiotic resistance
between 2005 and 2016 were the result of MRSA infections. Bloodstream infections from community-acquired
MRSA have declined less sharply than hospital-acquired MRSA during this time (-17% and -6.9%, respectively),
whereas cases of community-associated methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) have risen nearly 4%. Nearly
half of all health-care-associated infections are now attributed to MSSA rather than MRSA. At the same time,
MSSA and MRSA are being identified as the cause of infective endocarditis with greater frequency. The changing
dynamics of S. aureus infections demonstrate the critical need to better our understanding of its pathogenesis
in order to develop new approaches for prevention and treatment. One of the competitive advantages S. aureus
has within the infection site is its ability to scavenge host-derived fatty acids to satisfy its own lipid biosynthesis
needs. The mechanisms of the fatty acid kinase pathway are well-documented for monounsaturated fatty acids
like oleic acid. However, the fatty acid content of the human body varies dramatically between different organs
and tissues. Despite their prevalence in the human body, we have overlooked the role of host-derived saturated,
straight-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in investigations of the fatty acid kinase pathway. Our long-term goal is to
increase the efficacy of existing antibacterial therapies by purposefully and selectively remodeling the
staphylococcal membrane during infection. The overall objective for this application is to define the lipid
composition of S. aureus within the complex environment of the mammalian host and identify the impacts of
host-derived FAs on the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. aureus. Our central hypothesis is that the S. aureus
membrane mimics the fatty acyl composition of the infection site to a greater extent than previously thought and
that the resulting impacts on membrane physiology modify the tolerance of S. aureus to antimicrobials. The
rationale for this project is that more effective antimicrobial treatment regimens will be developed by accounting
for or exploiting the lipid composition of S. aureus when residing within the mammalian host. In Aim 1, we will
determine the prevalence and fate of mammalian-derived saturated and unsaturated fatty acids using advanced
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. In Aim 2, we will identify the impact of S. aureus'
use of exogenous fatty acids on its membrane physiology and cell morphology. In Aim 3, we will test the
hypothesis that host-derived fatty acids can influence antibiotic tolerances of S. aureus in vitro and in vivo. We
expect that the results of our research will prompt greater appreciation and consideration of host-derived fatty
acids as modulators of antibiotic susceptibility and tolerance, which will have the positive impact of reducing poor
clinical outcomes from S. aureus infections."
10768699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA replication is constantly challenged by a variety of genotoxins that arise from the environment. These
genotoxins can be directly produced by the environment (e.g. UV and ionizing radiation) or can arise indirectly
in response to environmental agents (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, reactive oxygen species).
Nascent strand degradation (NSD) and fork reversal promote genome stability in response to genotoxins by
facilitating replication fork restart. Despite the importance of nascent strand degradation and fork reversal,
there are many open questions about this pathway. For example, too much or too little degradation results in
genome stability. It is therefore important to understand how nascent strand degradation is efficiently triggered
when needed but with enough specificity that spurious degradation is avoided. However, we do not currently
understand how nascent strand degradation is triggered. Additionally, current models for nascent strand
degradation are too limited to explain the dozens of proteins currently implicated. Inherited defects in several of
these proteins are directly implicated in human diseases (e.g. SMARCAL1, BRCA1, BRCA2) suggesting that
defects in this pathway may alter individuals’ susceptibility to environmental genotoxins. Thus, it is crucial to
develop a robust paradigm for nascent strand degradation and fork reversal to establish exactly how this
pathway leads to replication restart and genome stability. Current approaches to study nascent strand
degradation and fork reversal lack the specificity and sensitivity to address these questions. To overcome
these limitations, we have developed a new site-specific, highly sensitive, and synchronous approach to study
nascent strand degradation and fork reversal in vitro using Xenopus egg extracts. This system contains the full
set of cellular proteins involved in DNA replication and DNA repair and provides unparalleled opportunities to
observe and manipulate these processes. Our new approach has already revealed key insights into the
requirements for nascent strand degradation and the mechanism by which it takes place. The proposed work
will combine biochemical and single molecule approaches, both in Xenopus egg extracts and human cells. We
will leverage our existing insights and exploit the power of our new system to determine how nascent strand
degradation and fork reversal are triggered and the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in these
processes. This work will enhance our understanding of one of the major cellular pathways that responds to
environmentally sourced genotoxins and allow us to better understand how defects in this pathway may alter
individuals’ susceptibility to environmental genotoxins."
10912901,"Abstract
Type I hyperlipoproteinemia (T1HLP, also known as familial chylomicronemia syndrome or FCS) is a rare,
autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by extreme hypertriglyceridemia due to a deficiency of
lipoprotein lipase or related proteins. Treatment of these patients is challenging as conventional triglyceride-
lowering medications, such as fibrates and fish oil, are ineffective. An extremely low fat diet is helpful, however,
despite good dietary compliance, some patients continue to have severe hypertriglyceridemia and recurrent
pancreatitis which can be life threatening. There is a pressing need for developing novel therapeutic options for
these patients, as currently, there is no FDA approved medication. Our recent preliminary data from a
randomized, open-label, clinical trial of orlistat (an inhibitor of intestinal lipase) with a four-period, two- sequence
(“orlistat” and “off orlistat” for 3 months), crossover study design in two young males (11 and 9 years old) with
T1HLP revealed more than 50% reduction in fasting serum triglycerides with only minimal side effects. However,
the long-term efficacy and safety of orlistat therapy for children and adults with T1HLP remains unknown.
Potential complications of long-term orlistat use include deficiencies in fat soluble vitamins, steatorrhea,
hyperoxaluric nephrolithiasis, and alteration in fecal microbiota.
Therefore, we wish to study the long-term efficacy and safety of orlistat for reducing serum triglyceride levels in
patients with T1HLP. We plan to enroll 28 patients with T1HLP (fasting serum triglycerides ≥ 1,000 mg/dL) in a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial with an open-label extension. After a screening
evaluation, the subjects will be advised to consume an extremely low fat diet (≤15% of total energy from fat) for
the entire duration of the study. After the baseline period of 8 weeks, they will be randomly assigned to placebo
or orlistat for the duration of 24 weeks (Phase 1). After Phase 1, all patients will enter an open-label extension
(Phase 2) and receive orlistat for a period of 24 weeks for a total duration of 48 weeks. During the last week of
Baseline Period, Phase 1, and at 24 weeks of Phase 2, patients will be admitted to the in-patient Clinical
Research Unit for 4 days to measure serum lipoproteins and chemistry panel for 3 consecutive days, fat-soluble
vitamin levels, 24 hour urine oxalate and stone risk profile, mineral balance, 72 hour fecal fat, fecal microbiota,
hepatic triglyceride, liver and spleen volume, and will complete gastrointestinal and quality of life questionnaires.
The primary endpoint will be fasting serum triglycerides. The secondary endpoint variables will be apolipoprotein
B-48 levels, liver fat content and volume. Safety will be assessed by measuring fat soluble vitamins levels, body
weight, quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms, oxalic aciduria, fecal fat excretion and fecal microbiota.
Generalized linear mixed models will be used for statistical comparisons. Our data will determine long-term
safety and efficacy of orlistat therapy for patients with T1HLP and orlistat may become the first line therapy as
an adjunct to extremely low fat diet in these patients."
10836466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Substance use is a major public health concern that disproportionately affects individuals from lower
socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. Although part of this association is attributable to downward
socioeconomic mobility among individuals who develop problematic patterns of use, emerging evidence
suggests that part may also reflect disadvantage-driven changes in brain development that increase risk of use
and negative use-related outcomes. However, because much of the research supporting this hypothesized
pathway is cross-sectional in nature, characterized by limited measurement of relevant constructs, and
conducted in disproportionately White, middle-/upper-class samples, the utility of targeting this pathway with
intervention/prevention efforts is unclear. The aims of the proposed career development award are thus
twofold: (1) to train the candidate in the use of geospatial tools and related statistical techniques, neuroimaging
approaches to characterizing distributed changes in brain structure and function, and theory and principles
from health disparities research, and (2) to use this training to test for associations between childhood
socioeconomic status, brain structure and connectivity, and substance use trajectories that generalize across
racial/ethnic groups using three population-representative, longitudinal cohort studies. The candidate will
receive training essential for his development as an independent research scientist under the guidance of an
outstanding team of mentors and consultants with extensive experience studying socioeconomic status, brain
development, self-regulation, health disparities, and substance use (Drs. Sylia Wilson, Monica Luciana,
Damien Fair, Shervin Assari, Martha Farah, and Daniel Berry). The research will be conducted at the Institute
of Child Development (ICD) and Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (MCTFR), which together
offer unparalleled resources to support work identifying the neural and behavioral mediators connecting
children’s early-life environments and later substance use. Altogether, the candidate will address four specific
aims: (1) test whether children from low SES backgrounds are more likely to develop problematic substance
use trajectories and establish whether these associations generalize across different types of substance use;
(2) test whether low childhood SES is associated with individual differences in brain structure and resting-state
functional connectivity across distributed networks associated with self-regulatory abilities (i.e., cognitive
control, reward sensitivity, negative emotionality); (3) test whether these differences in distributed neural
networks mediate associations between low childhood SES and substance use trajectories; and (4) test
whether the strength of these associations differ for racial/ethnic minority vs. White children in accordance with
the notion of marginalization-related diminished returns. Results of the proposed project have great potential to
prompt reconceptualization of brain-based models of substance use and addiction, and, in turn, guide
prevention and intervention efforts to reduce an important behavioral health disparity."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified immune pathways linked to the pathogenesis of
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, despite these insights, our understanding of how individual
genetic variants promote autoimmunity remains poor. Loss-of-function mutations in genes of the phagocytic
NADPH oxidase complex (NOX2), including NCF1 and NCF2, have been linked with the pathogenesis of SLE
and other humoral autoimmune diseases. The current model for how reduced NOX2 activity promotes lupus
development focuses on defects in the clearance of apoptotic material by phagocytic myeloid lineages. While
myeloid defects likely contribute to disease risk, we hypothesize that a parallel B cell-intrinsic mechanism
underlies the profound increase risk of SLE in human carriers of NCF1 and NCF2 variants. In addition to the
production of pathogenic autoantibodies, recent studies have demonstrated that B cells can promote lupus
pathogenesis by initiating immune tolerance breaks and facilitating the generation of spontaneous germinal
centers (GC). The activation of autoreactive B cells in SLE requires B cell-intrinsic expression of the endosomal
toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9, and our published and preliminary data show that reduced NOX2 activity
results in dysregulated endosomal TLR signaling by impacting non-canonical autophagy pathways. Based on
these data, we hypothesize that a B cell-specific reduction in NOX2 activity will result in enhanced TLR-
dependent GC formation and the development of humoral autoimmunity. We will test this idea via parallel in vivo
and in vitro mechanistic studies. In Aim 1, we will test whether B cell-intrinsic deletion NOX2 component genes
results in enhanced TLR-dependent GC responses using a well-characterized model of viral infection. In Aim 2,
we will study whether reduced NOX2 activity promotes autoantibody production and humoral autoimmunity in
murine SLE. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use biochemical and cell imaging approaches to test whether NAPDH
oxidase activity impacts B cell TLR signaling and non-canonical autophagy pathways using both murine genetic
models and gene-edited human B cells. Together, these studies promise to advance our understanding of lupus
pathogenesis and may inform the design of future targeted therapies for human SLE."

operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers
of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to
opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose
to opioid addiction, and under what conditions.
Given the
We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel
(HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone
intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human
populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment
and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to
brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data
to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted
using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to
further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to
obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral
oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors,
and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of
oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high
precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes
with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used.
We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2
platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to
GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie
this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly
define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants
and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence
differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics
approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to
precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake."

This is a competitive renewal of grant award R01MH59299, enhanced by significant new in vivo multi-modal
functional imaging directions (1H fMRS and fMRI). These innovations facilitate a never-before attempted
understanding of specific aspects of dysfunctional neurobiology in youth with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
(OCD). OCD is a severe, prevalent, and chronically disabling disorder emerging during childhood/adolescence
(80% of cases) with well-delineated clinical phenomenology/nosology. However, the relationship between the
clinical phenomenology and modes of brain dysfunction is only generally understood. For example, our prior
work using 1H MRS and fMRI has implicated general neurochemistry and function of the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC). However, dACC engages in contextually dependent excitatory or inhibitory modes of
behavior/control that are likely to induce changes in the steady-state excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic
drive of the dACC. However, which of these response modes (and the shift in the E/I balance they induce) is
particularly relevant to OCD, and its sensitivity to OCD dimensions (Obsessions or Compulsions) and comorbid
anxiety symptoms are completely unknown. Here, we aim to parse apart dysfunction in excitatory and/or
inhibitory tone of the dACC in relation to OCD. In doing so, we provide a transformative extension of evidence
supported under prior grant iterations demonstrating dysfunctional activation and connectivity of the dACC in
OCD youth. Now, we use specifically designed motor paradigms with distinct excitatory or inhibitory response
modes which induce complementary demands on dACC function. The tasks are administered during multi-
modal functional imaging acquisition that includes ¹H fMRS and fMRI. 1H fMRS, which permits understanding
of the functional biochemistry of the dACC, is uncoupled from hemodynamics and is ideally suited to
investigate functional imbalances in the E/I synaptic drive of the dACC. In the same participants and using the
same tasks, fMRI will be acquired in the service of understanding changes in task-induced whole brain network
dynamics and connectomics. This unique project combines the clinical and multi-modal functional
neuroimaging expertise at Wayne State University to achieve a transformative explication of the dysfunctional
neurobiology of OCD. The combination of ¹H fMRS and fMRI will be acquired in 100 OCD youth and 100
matched healthy controls (12 - 19 years), allowing us to measure: a) brain function via glutamate modulation
(¹H fMRS) and the BOLD signal (fMRI); b) brain plasticity related to shifts in the E/I synaptic drive (1H fMRS);
and c) network dynamics and connectomics (fMRI). In addition to providing compelling and clinically relevant in
vivo characterization of disordered excitatory vs. inhibitory signaling in the pathophysiology of OCD, the
proposal provides a scientific blueprint for how multi-modal imaging can explicate in vivo brain function. The
accumulated knowledge will promote better diagnostic and treatment approaches through a more detailed
characterization of OCD pathophysiology."
10758289,"E3Gen: Multigenerational influences of social structure on toxicant exposures and life course health in the
ELEMENT cohort
SUMMARY
Traditional epidemiological research and methods often focus separately on how social, economic, and environmental
factors affect individuals’ life course health, yet evolving research underscores the importance of considering the
integrated effects of factors that cluster in those who are most socially disadvantaged. Multiple mechanistic pathways
with complex linkages must also be taken into account to understand the effects of social structures and chemical
exposures that underlie environmental health disparities. This challenge depends not only on the integration of measures
of socioeconomic status into environmental cohort studies, but also qualitative and geographic information on
neighborhood infrastructure and social conditions that can illuminate individuals’ lived experiences and facilitate new
scientific directions. While substantial research examines the developmental origins and biologic mechanisms underlying
toxicant-health associations, few cohorts have the ability to address the intergenerational legacy of toxicant exposures
and social structures on life course health.1 This U24 competitive renewal application leverages the rich data and research
infrastructure of the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. Here, we propose
expanding our E3Gen cohort maintenance activities to integrate novel measures of social structure and ethnographic data
into our biologic and data repositories in this unique, multi-generational cohort of mother-child dyads followed for ~28
years. This expansion also will implement streamlined protocols to enhance follow-up and engage the original ELEMENT
offspring as they transition to adulthood and begin to have children of their own, setting the stage for research examining
the impact of social and environmental exposures on reproductive and metabolic health and development across 3
generations. Specific aims are to: 1) Create and collect household and individual qualitative and quantitative data to
understand the direct effects of social and economic stressors and their potential to modify the multigenerational, life
course effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes. 2) Encourage participation and prevent loss to follow up
among ~600 ELEMENT offspring now aged 16-28 years and establish passive surveillance to recruit their children currently
and projected to be born over the next 5 years. 3) Develop and test novel, nonlinear multidimensional methods to
integrate and harmonize qualitative and quantitative data, foster cross-project data communication and novel
interdisciplinary partnerships, and accelerate data sharing with the larger environmental health sciences community.
Through our existing partnerships with minority-serving institutions Hampton and Fisk Universities and Spelman College,
we will train diverse students in environmental epidemiology, global public health and biostatistics via summer
undergraduate internships and accelerated master’s degree programs.

10817761,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical for almost every aspect of animal life. These
proteins are embedded in the cell membrane and allow us to sense and respond to light, smells,
and taste. GPCRs also control responses in both our central and autonomic nervous systems,
and they regulate both inflammation and immunity. GPCRs control cell migration for normal
development and during cancer metastasis. Indeed, approximately 34% of FDA-approved drugs
target GPCRs. Nonetheless, despite decades of study, many GPCRs have no known function,
their ligands remain unidentified, and the pathways through which they elicit distinct cellular
responses remain mostly uncharacterized. Here, we propose to take the first steps toward
understanding the roles of GPCRs during development in the experimental system of the
Drosophila embryo, which has numerous advantages in terms of visual accessibility, an
extensive armamentarium of genetic tools, and relatively low cost.
We begin with an analysis of the Drosophila GPCR Tre1, which has been implicated in germ
cell (GC) navigation and survival, extravasation of immune cell to sites of injury, and polarization
of neuroblasts. We have recently reported that non-canonical Hedgehog signaling works
through the Tre1 receptor to control GC navigation, resolving a long-standing conflict regarding
the role of Hh in this process and revealing a novel pathway downstream of Tre1 activation. In
the first aim, we uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which each step of this
pathway is mediated – from receptor binding to actin polymerization. We ask if and how other
genes that affect GC migration work through this pathway to repel GCs (in the case of the
Wunen lipid phosphate phosphatases) or attract GCs (in the case of HMGCoA reductase). Tre1
is also expressed in the forming salivary gland (SG), a tissue that, unlike GCs, migrates as a
fully polarized epithelial collective. We ask if Hh signaling and Tre1 also function in the SG for its
navigation and we ask if Tre1 function in this tissue complements or antagonizes the function of
another GPCR – Mthl5 – which is expressed in the SG at about the same time and that has also
been implicated in Hh signaling. Finally, we establish a pipeline to screen all of the GPCRs
encoded in the Drosophila genome and expressed in embryos for roles in the development of
either GCs or the SG. Our pilot screen has already identified two GPCRs with phenotypes
consistent with important functions, one gene with a potential role in GC survival and the other
with a potential role in regulating the SG extracellular matrix."

Estimates from the Alzheimer's Association indicate that approximately one in ten older adults in the US have
Alzheimer's disease (AD) while 15 to 20% have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), projecting that about a third
of those will develop dementia within five years. Several variables have been associated with delaying the
onset and rate of cognitive decline in AD and have been grouped under the Cognitive Reserve/ Resilience
(CR/R) theory; it postulates that complex mental activity throughout the lifetime creates resistance to cognitive
decline despite the biological risk (brain loss). Emerging evidence shows that bilingualism may be one of these
neuroprotective factors in the aging brain, but results in bilingualism and CR/R remain inconsistent. Our
objective is to analyze the contribution of bilingualism to CR/R in a large cohort of aging Spanish/English
bilinguals and Spanish monolinguals with amnestic MCI (aMCI). To overcome limitations in previous research,
we will use a longitudinal design, operational characterization of bilingualism, refined sociocultural measures,
and multimodal neuroimaging. The current study will leverage and extend a large ongoing NIH cohort
prospective study from the 1Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (1Florida ADRC), in which
Spanish/English bilingual Hispanics with aMCI are well-represented (n = 120), but Spanish monolinguals are
underrepresented although they comprise approximately 40% of foreign-born Hispanics in the US. In the
present study, we directly address this by deploying an intensive, culturally-informed, community-engaged
research approach in the Miami area to increase outreach and recruit 120 Hispanic monolinguals with aMCI.
We will make the ADRC MCI bilingual and monolingual groups ethnically equivalent and create a longitudinal
data set (n=240), ensuring that we are well-powered to determine the contribution of bilingualism to CR in the
aMCI population. As co-investigators on the 1Florida ADRC, our research team is well-positioned to execute
the proposed study. We will collect neuropsychological data at years 1, 2, and 3 and neuroimaging data (MRI
and DTI) at years 1 and 3. The neuropsychological battery will include the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scale for
Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L), a cognitive stress test that evaluates failure to recover from
Proactive Semantic Interference (frPSI) and is highly sensitive to subtle cognitive changes in early AD. The
innovation lies in studying the relationship between brain diffusivity measures of WM and frPSI, as measured
by the LASSI-L in combination with volumetric brain data; the use of Bilingual indexes of language proficiency
and degrees of acculturation, and levels of education. Our findings will advance our understanding of the
complex interactions between neural, environmental, and sociocultural factors and the role of bilingualism in
CR/R in AD/ADRD, paving the way for new targets for interventions and providing fundamental insight into the
role of language(s) in the aging brain."
10757952,"ABSTRACT. Phosphorylation is one of the most ubiquitous, reversible posttranslational modifications in cells,
and is a critical component of most signaling cascades. Strict temporal and spatial control are essential for the
fidelity of this process, as derailed signaling cascades lead to disease. Here, we continue our long-standing
effort to investigate signaling in neurons. If neuronal signaling goes awry, the most prominent results are well
known diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Recently, we successfully determined how the most
ubiquitous neuronal ser/thr protein phosphatase (PPP) calcineurin (CN) recruits its substrates. Namely, CN
binds regulators and substrates via CN-specific recruitment motifs (PxIxIT and LxVP). Further, we also
discovered that CN uses an active site recognition sequence (TxxP) to target substrate phosphosites, which,
in turn, drives vital biological functions. This is the first defined active site recognition sequence for any PPP,
transforming our ability to identify novel CN-specific phosphosites. Here, we will leverage our newly established
tools and discoveries to achieve three aims. First, we will establish the CN interactome and substratome in
distinct neuronal populations. This will enable us to demonstrate the diversity of CN functions in neurons, define
if they differ in response to stimuli as well as identify the molecular substrates that are necessary for these
changes to occur. Building further on the success of the previous funding period, we will also advance our
molecular understanding of CN substrate recruitment by studying two critical CN substrate signaling platforms:
CN-AKAP5 and CN-TAK1. Specifically, we will show that the these signaling platforms utilize multiple,
competing PxIxIT/LxVP motifs to recruit CN via different proteins and show how these distinct mechanisms
define CN substrate dephosphorylation efficacy. Critically, our preliminary data suggest that posttranslational
modification of AKAP5 modulates CN control of PKA activity and ultimately receptor regulation. Finally, we
have also recently confirmed our prediction that the transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1)
binds directly to CN. However, unexpectedly the TAK1 regulator TAB2 also binds directly to CN via different
LxVP and PxIxIT motifs. We will investigate the mechanisms and consequences of this interaction on CN
recruitment and TAK1 function. The modes of action and regulation of CN in the AKAP5 and TAK1 signaling
platforms are unexpected and highlight the broad variety of mechanisms used to regulate CN activity. Taken
together, the proposed studies leverage a powerful integrated approach that combines atomic resolution
techniques with biochemical and cell biology experiments to obtain novel insights into the molecular
mechanisms used to direct CN activity. Because CN has critical roles in human diseases generally, and in the
brain specifically, and because CN is the only successfully therapeutically targeted PPP (CN is the target of
the blockbuster immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK-506), our proposed work will provide a critically
needed molecular and cellular understanding of CN activity and regulation in neuronal function."
10749034,"There is a dire need for new treatment approaches to glioblastoma (GBM), a uniformly lethal brain cancer. We
previously reported that targeting the lipid kinase Diacylglycerol kinase-α (DGKα) has therapeutic potential
against GBM; we demonstrated direct actions on cancer cells and on angiogenesis, while others have
identified a role for DGKα in T cell reactivity. In addition, we identified an abandoned medication safe in
humans, ritanserin, as a novel DGKα inhibitor that can be repurposed to accelerate clinical translation of this
therapeutic strategy. Our new preliminary data indicate in an immunocompetent mouse model of GBM that
intermittent low dosing of ritanserin is dramatically more effective than similar cumulative doses done in a near-
continuous fashion. Furthermore, other new data suggest a novel immunologic mechanism for DGKα inhibition
involving bosting macrophage and microglia function, and also show synergistic activity in combining a DGKα
inhibitor and anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition or temozolomide in mouse GBM models. This revised proposal
focuses on developing these novel findings with three Specific Aims. The first Aim investigates the effects of
DGKα inhibitors on macrophages and microglia, testing a putative mechanism as well. It also tests the
hypothesis that the anti-mesenchymal activity of DGKα inhibition will reduce expression of immunosuppressive
proteins in GBM cells. Aim 2 will dissect in syngeneic mouse models of GBM the immunologic and other
effects of intermittent low dosing of DGKα inhibition, identifying mechanisms for its curative potential in mouse
GBM and comparing treatment schedules. While our new data show striking efficacy of intermittent ritanserin in
a mouse GBM model, we anticipate that combination therapy will be necessary to effectively treat GBM in
patients; therefore Aim 3 tests combinations of intermittent ritanserin with other agents—anti-PD1 checkpoint
inhibition and temozolomide—based on strong rationales and preliminary data. The most effective combination
will be advanced for clinical investigation. Successful completion of the proposed studies will establish critical
therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of DGKα inhibition, alone and in combination, helping to place it in the
GBM armamentarium but with broader implications for oncology and other areas as well."
10831388,"Presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) following successful treatment of primary
tumors poses a risk factor for metastasis which is the leading cause of cancer mortality. However, current
knowledge on mechanisms controlling the state of DTCs (persistent dormancy vs. reactivation) is limited. Only
detailed knowledge of DTC biology will open therapeutic alternatives which will extend remission.
 We demonstrated that the transcription factor NR2F1/COUP-TFI triggers the dormancy phase of DTCs
in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) by regulating the retinoic acid pathway and inducing a
long-lasting cell cycle arrest. Here we present new preliminary data showing that the dormant HNSCC DTC
population is heterogeneous and that the pluripotency gene SOX2 is upregulated in a subpopulation of DTCs
that co-exist with, but are distinct from, NR2F1+ dormant DTCs in the lungs and lymph nodes. SOX2 maintains
the dormancy of DTCs by upregulating LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) and OSM (oncostatin M) signaling and by
repressing retinoic acid- and MYC-related genes. In addition, the SOX2-driven dormancy program involves
chromatin remodeling and appears to dictate a much shorter dormancy phase that facilitates higher metastasis
initiating capacity (reactivation).
 We hypothesize that SOX2-induced dormancy is enabled via enhancer regulation and LIF/OSM signaling
which facilitates greater reactivation potential and metastasis-initiating capacity than the less reactivation prone
NR2F1+ DTCs. We also propose that a persistent state of dormancy with lower reactivation potential can be
induced in SOX2+ DTCs by inducing NR2F1 activity. Lastly, we propose that SOX2+ DTCs can be selectively
targeted by chemotherapy due to their higher reactivation rate. The specific aims of this study are:
SA1. To identify the mechanism of dormancy and the reactivation rate controlled by SOX2 in DTCs. We
will identify and functionalize the transcriptional targets of SOX2 (including LIF/OSM) in controlling the dormancy
and rate of reactivation by using ChIP-Seq analysis, gain and loss of function, lung-explant organ culture model,
and validation in human biospecimens.
SA2. To determine whether SOX2+ dormant DTCs can be targeted to inhibit their reactivation or
eliminated. We will determine 1- whether SOX2-driven dormancy program can be converted into an NR2F1-
driven program with low reactivation potential by using protocols to induce NR2F1 activity and 2- whether SOX2+
DTCs can be selectively targeted by chemotherapy due to their higher reactivation rate, compared to NR2F1+
DTCs by using cellular barcoding and clonal tracking technology.
 Our long-term objective is to identify predictive biomarkers of the DTC status (dormant vs proliferating)
and to gain insight necessary for therapeutic strategies to either maintain DTCs in a stable dormancy phase or
induce their eradication."

One of the major challenges in vaccine development is access to adjuvants that promote long-lived pathogen
specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and provide protective cell mediated immunity. Our previous studies
identified a molecular adjuvant that uses CD40 and TLR agonists (CD40/TLR) that induces protective long-
lived T cell populations in mice and primates but why this approach is so effective is unclear. We believe that if
we can understand why this adjuvant is different from other adjuvants or infection induced responses then it
will help in the rational design of vaccines to generate protective cell mediated immunity. We have documented
that vaccine-elicited T cells (Tvax) are distinct from infection-elicited T cells (Tinf) and this includes a unique
metabolic program and unanticipated requirement for the cytokine IL-27 for Tvax generation. In addition, the
ability of a specialized subset of dendritic cells (cDC1), to produce IL-27 predicts the magnitude of vaccine-
elicited CD8+ T cell expansion and memory formation. Our recent studies have identified an IL-27-dependent
c-Myc transcriptional signature within Tvax that is associated with T cell proliferation and survival. We
developed a computational model which mathematically recapitulates T cell expansion data derived from
antigen challenge studies in vivo. This unsupervised analysis indicates that the ability of this adjuvant to rapidly
promote T cell interactions with APC at the initiation of T cell priming is the major predictor of the magnitude
and quality of the T cell response. Based on these data sets will use intravital imaging of T–DC interactions
and the manipulation of IL-27, DC functions and c-Myc pathways to understand the mechanistic determinants
of the combined CD40L/TLR adjuvant. These data sets will be integrated into a stochastic agent-based
mathematical model to predict and validate the key events involved in Tvax formation. The proposed studies
bring together the combined efforts of three productive laboratories and their respective expertise in adjuvant
discovery, CD8+ T cell biology, cytokine and transcriptional networks, multi photon imaging, and computational
modeling in order to understand the molecular basis for adjuvant-elicited cellular immunity."

Aim 1. To provide the Cancer COBRE and other NIH-funded investigators with resources and expertise in
molecular and cell biology and immunopathology including instrumentation, technical support, consultation and
training, and assistance in developing new methodologies.
Aim 2: To organize, coordinate, and facilitate interactions among COBRE investigators and work collaboratively
to develop and use new technologies and assays, and train PJIs, faculty, staff, and students in advanced

10578833,"As the US rapidly transitions into an aging society, aging-associated diseases are increasing in both
prevalence and cost. Compounding this concern is evidence that cohorts entering adulthood and midlife today
are less healthy than preceding generations were at those ages. The faster rate of aging among recent cohorts
is cause for concern, and necessitates earlier detection of aging-associated diseases, often well before midlife.
Determining the individual physiological changes linked to aging and health outcomes provides important
information about influences on the aging process, as well as identifying potential areas for intervention to
increase healthy lifespan and longevity. A variety of approaches to measuring physiological aging using sets of
biomarkers have been suggested in recent years—but currently little is known about how they correlate with
each other, how those relationships change over the life course, and to what degree the biomarkers of aging
are generalizable to population subgroups (by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES)). Early life
social adversities show strong and lasting associations with aging and aging-related diseases. However, a key
unanswered question is the degree to which biomarkers of aging across the life course link early life context to
later life health. To understand how biomarkers of aging correlate across the life course and link to SES and
social context we draw upon survey and biorepository data and samples from three large nationally
representative panel studies: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; representative of US population over age
50; biomarker data for ages 51-110), the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add
Health; representative of adolescents in grades 7-12 in 1994; biomarker data ages 24-42) and the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW; representative of birth in large US Cities 1998-2000; biomarker
data ages 9-24). The harmonization of biomarkers and survey data across these three panel studies provides
an unprecedented opportunity to discover how biomarkers of aging correlate over the life course and how they
correlate with SES and other social contextual factors associated with aging. Aim 1 will produce harmonized
data and measures for the research community from three national panel studies with special focus on
biomarkers: aging blood-based biomarkers (IL-6, TNFa, CRP, GDF15, IGF-1, Cystatin C, NT-proBNP, and
hbA1c), DNA methylation (Illumina EPIC chip), and gene expression (RNA Seq). Aim 2 will examine how the
biomarkers of aging are distributed and correlate with each other over the life course and across several key
demographics. Also, using already generated immune cell methylation (FF at ages 9 and 15) and RNA (AH
age 24-32) we will predict subsequent adult biomarkers of aging. Using the harmonized survey data, Aim 3 will
examine the link between biomarkers of aging and a set of contextual measures of early life and adult health
phenotypes. Results will provide insight into which measures from blood chemistry, methylation, and RNA can
be used to examine contextual influences on aging long before observable symptoms arise."

The overall goal of our research is to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mTOR
signaling is spatially regulated and to elucidate the contribution of subcellular mTORC1 signaling to
tumorigenesis and cancer therapy resistance. The signaling pathway regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates a number of processes that are critical
to cell physiology, and therefore is often dysregulated in diseases, including cancer. In particular, persistent
activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling circuitry is the most frequent dysregulated signaling mechanism in oral
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a disease that results in ~300,000 deaths each year worldwide, with 5-year
survival estimates of approximately 60%, despite aggressive multimodality therapies. Spatial
compartmentalization of PI3K/mTOR is not only critical for enhancing the signaling specificity, but also
required for proper functioning of the pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying spatial regulation of
PI3K/mTOR signaling remain poorly understood and it is not clear which subcellular pools of the signaling
molecules contribute to tumorigenesis and therapy resistance. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary
team with complementary expertise, including Dr. Jin Zhang, an expert in chemical biology and kinase
signaling, Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind, a renowned cancer biologist whose lab has focused on the study of oncogenic
signaling pathways driving OSCC initiation and progression. In our previous studies, we have created novel
tools for studying the spatial regulation of mTOR signaling, including a fluorescent biosensor for tracking
mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in living cells and an approach for achieving subcellular inhibition of
kinase signaling. Using these tools, we discovered novel mechanisms underlying regulation of nuclear
mTORC1. In the context of OSCC, we have shown that mTOR inhibition exerts potent antitumor activity in a
large series of genetically-defined and chemically-induced OSCC models and favorable clinical responses in a
recently completed clinical phase II trial (NCT01195922). The current proposal will develop new molecular
tools to interrogate the spatiotemporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling in living cells, elucidate the regulatory
mechanisms of nuclear mTORC1 signaling, and determine the functional roles of subcellular mTORC1
signaling in tumorigenesis and Cetuximab resistance in OSCC. Unravelling the function and regulation of
subcellular mTORC1 signaling should offer a path toward selective targeting of pathway components and yield
therapies with reduced toxicity and resistance."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, impacting millions of people globally.
Despite the advancements in understanding fundamental biological constructs of AD and the fact that the global
population of bilinguals has outnumbered monolinguals, our understanding of the impact of bilingualism on
AD/ADRD (AD and related dementias) remains limited. Previous bilingualism studies suggest that the bilingual
experience impacts cognition and AD/ADRD, albeit in varying scale that stems from variabilities in demographic
profiles and prevalence of ADRD risk factors.
 The overarching goal of this study is to directly interrogate the neural and sociocultural aspects of bilingualism
across multiple race/ethnic groups, with specific emphasis on deconstructing the links between bilingualism and
AD. To accomplish this, the University of California, San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in
California, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in India, and the Health and Aging Brain
Study- Health Disparities study in Texas will jointly assemble one of the largest, multicultural, multilingual, and
well-characterized cohort of 2,200 individuals representing the world’s most commonly spoken languages:
Chinese, Spanish, Kannada, and English languages.
 This study team will collect cross-sectional data on cognition, imaging, molecular biomarkers, language
background, and SDOH, and follow-up language, SDOH, and cognitive data for three years. We intend to build
a theoretical framework on the cognitive role of bilingualism by deconstructing bilingualism and examining its
features via a multidimensional lens. We will examine the inter-relationship of this multidimensional bilingualism
construct with cognition and social determinants of health using structural and functional magnetic resonance
imaging and AD/ADRD molecular biomarkers. Our central hypothesis is that specific bilingualism features would
influence the cognitive trajectory by improving executive control through the mechanism of brain and cognitive
reserve even after accounting for social determinants of health and AD/ADRD biomarkers.
 This proposed study will provide novel mechanistic insights into the multidimensionality of bilingualism and
create an exclusive opportunity to study the cognitive relevance of bilingualism using socio-demographically and
linguistically diverse cohorts. This study also has the unique settings to evaluate the generalizability of the
proposed cognitive-bilingualism theoretical framework across populations that differ in sociocultural,
demographic, and linguistic background."
10772072,"ABSTRACT
Our overarching goal is to investigate the genetic architecture of canonical functional resting-state
networks (RSN) in PTSD. The disruption of several canonical RSNs including the default mode network
(DMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and salience network (SN) are strongly implicated in posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). These RSN alterations are associated with specific symptom clusters of PTSD (e.g.
intrusive re-experiencing symptoms). Canonical RSN connectivity and regional amplitude of BOLD signal,
which are associated with PTSD and its symptom dimensions, constitute highly heritable phenotypes (h2 = 0.4
– 0.6) that exceed the heritability of task-based fMRI and the majority of structural neuroimaging phenotypes. A
genetic vulnerability to developing PTSD following exposure to trauma has long been hypothesized and is now
supported by evidence. Discovery of the genetic factors involved in brain communication and brain connectivity
that contribute to PTSD may prove vital to new treatment breakthroughs. The coupling of brain connectivity
with its genetic architecture, mapping the neurogenetic pathways of PTSD, and new knowledge of neural and
genetic mechanisms will support precision-medicine guided drug discovery for managing mental illnesses that
follow psychological trauma. Our aims are to 1: Investigate differences in the genetic architecture of functional
connectomics associated with PTSD. 2: Investigate the role of PTSD on the relationship between the genetic
architecture of brain structure and functional connectomics. 3: Investigate the effects of PTSD on the link
between gene transcription architecture and functional connectomics. The coupling of cortical functional
connectomics with its genetic architecture and its transcriptional architecture in relation to known disruptions of
functional connectomics in PTSD may offer exciting opportunities to discover targeted therapies. Mapping the
neurogenetic pathways of PTSD to the severity of PTSD symptoms will also be critical to the future design,
development, and selection of yet undiscovered treatments. Knowledge of their unique neural and genetic
mechanisms will be vital to precision-medicine guided drug discovery for managing mental illnesses that may
follow psychological trauma."
10807102,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric (mental, behavioral and neurological) disorders are increasingly dominating the burden on
US healthcare. Yet, our understanding of such disorders is largely restricted to a description of symptoms, and
the treatments remain palliative. Several large-scale efforts, including the Human Connectome Project (HCP)
and the BRAIN Initiative call for the development of technologies to map brain circuits to improve our
understanding of brain function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in these initiatives as a
powerful non-invasive methodology to study the human brain, including anatomical, functional and diffusion
imaging. Yet, MRI methods have major limitations on achievable resolutions and acquisition speed. These
affect both high resolution whole brain acquisitions that aim to image voxel volumes that contain only a few
thousand neurons for improved understanding of the brain, and also the more commonly utilized research and
clinical protocols. This, in turn, necessitates improved reconstruction methods to facilitate faster acquisitions.
Several strategies have been proposed for improved reconstruction of MRI data. Recently, deep learning (DL)
has emerged as an alternative for accelerated MRI showing improved quality over conventional approaches.
However, it also faces challenges that hinder its utility, especially in high-resolution brain MRI, including need
for large databases of reference data for training, concerns about generalization to unseen pathologies not
well-represented in training datasets, robustness issues related to recovery of fine structures, and difficulties in
training networks for processing multi-dimensional image series. In this proposal, we will develop and validate
robust and efficient learning strategies for high-resolution brain DL MRI reconstruction without large databases
of reference data. We will develop self-supervised learning methods for training with small referenceless
databases or in a scan-specific manner. We will augment these with uncertainty-guided training strategies for
improved recovery of areas with high uncertainty, methods for synergistically combining random matrix theory
based denoising with DL reconstruction, and memory-efficient distributed learning techniques to process large
image series. Our developments will enable at least a two-fold improvement in acceleration rates over existing
protocols, and at higher resolutions. They will be validated on HCP-style acquisitions with extensive
anatomical, functional and microstructural evaluation at multiple resolutions. Finally, we will curate a whole
brain sub-millimeter HCP-style database for studying functional and structural connectivity at the level cortical
layers and columns, while also facilitating technical developments for new modeling, image processing and
reconstruction algorithms. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform the scales that
can be imaged with MRI, improve the quality of existing protocols and/or significantly reduce scan times,
leading to reductions in healthcare costs, improved diagnosis and/or increased patient throughput."
10758232,"Understanding the genetic basis of human disease will require a deep understanding of genetic effects on
gene expression. The vast majority of disease-risk loci are non-coding, so in order to link them to target
genes, cellular pathways, and cell types, we seek to identify which genes’ expression they disrupt and under
what conditions. Population studies of gene expression have now provided thousands of “expression
quantitative trait loci” (eQTLs) where individual genetic variants are associated with expression of a target
gene. While eQTL studies across tissues and populations have served as a valuable resource for querying
the likely gene targets of disease loci, key obstacles remain. First, eQTL studies simply do not address rare
genetic variation, thus excluding evaluation of tens of thousands of variants per individual whole genome
sequence, and many known pathogenic loci. Second, even among common variants, it is estimated that
over half of disease loci do not coincide with any known eQTL, even based on current multi-tissue data. The
remainder of disease loci and rare variants require new data and statistical methods in order to characterize
their mechanisms. Here, we propose a research agenda to decipher the complex impact of regulatory
genetic variation across the frequency spectrum. 1) First, we will pursue analysis of rare genetic variation
and statistical methods for personal whole genome interpretation. Current methods simply do not provide
confident predictions for the majority of the variants from whole genome sequencing, and the overall impact
of rare regulatory variation on human disease is unknown. We will investigate the use of personal RNA-seq
and other functional data to complement whole genome sequence (WGS) in the evaluation of rare variant
impact, personal genome interpretation for rare disease patients, and incorporation of rare variants into
population studies and genetic risk scores. 2) Second, we will consider common disease variants that are
not characterized by current eQTL studies, which almost all use static, adult tissue samples and bulk
RNA-seq data. Genetic effects on gene expression are not static, but rather vary over time, cell type, and
environment, complicating the identification of disease mechanism. Some disease loci may have only
transient effects on a proximal gene’s expression during development, for example. We will study temporally
dynamic and context-specific genetic effects. In a novel study, we will evaluate genetic effects on individual
cell types and states during cellular differentiation using time-series single-cell RNA-seq across individuals.
We will also evaluate dynamic genetic effects during disease progression based on patient longitudinal
data. Combined with novel statistical methods, these will provide a map of genetic effects over cell-type,
time, and context that may better explain disease loci. All data, methods, and software will be made publicly
available. Our work will provide a greater understanding of regulatory genetic effects for both common and
rare variants, enabling improved identification of the mechanisms underlying heritable disease."

The overall goal of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Neurodevelopment and Its
Disorders (CNDD) is to enhance research capacity by enabling outstanding multidisciplinary collaborative
research in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). This area
is of importance to the state of South Carolina as the diagnosis rate and proportion of individuals with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who have significant cognitive impairments is estimated to be higher than those of the
nation. The specific aims are to: 1) Mentor a strong cadre of early career scientists to become independently
funded investigators in NDD research; 2) Establish sustainable core resources to support modern NDD research
while leveraging institutional investments; and 3) Promote sustainability of the CNDD through creation of
multidisciplinary research programs, rigorous evaluation, strategic improvement, and mission alignment with
other Centers at MUSC and across the state of South Carolina. The Center is led by a multidisciplinary team,
composed of a department chair with extensive experience in molecular neurobiology, an expert in the field of
complement biology, and a clinical psychologist focused on ASD research within the MUSC College of Medicine,
coalescing resources to achieve their overarching objective of building a critical mass of funded investigators
that will allow MUSC to compete for future external peer-reviewed programmatic grant support. This application
highlights four of our most outstanding Junior Investigators (JIs) who will benefit from an innovative multiple
source mentoring plan which features both internal and external mentors. We anticipate each of these JIs to
transition to independent NIH funding within the first three years of the project. The CNDD also includes three
Cores that will support not only the JIs but also NDD investigators throughout MUSC. Scientific cores include
the: 1) Genomic and Bioinformatic Core, which will provide technical assistance, computational infrastructure,
and training opportunities; 2) Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Core, which will provide access to and training in
behavioral analyses of mice; and 3) Small Animal Brain Imaging Core, which will provide access to modern brain
imaging technologies that can extend the scope and impact of neurodevelopment research. Additionally, the
CNDD will foster collaborations among NDD researchers by promoting interdisciplinary scientific exchange
through our enrichment activities and build research capabilities through our Pilot Project Program. With NIH
and institutional support, the expansion of research capabilities, development of JIs, and promotion of integrative,
multidisciplinary NDD research programs, the proposed CNDD will substantially enhance basic, translational,
and clinical research at MUSC. Together with key institutional investments across the state, the CNDD will enable
the formation of a sustainable, thriving hub of world-class research in neurodevelopment and its disorders in
South Carolina."

Multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) are bacteria that have become resistant to more than one antimicrobial
agent. Intestinal MDROs constitute a major threat to public health because they are increasingly difficult to treat
and result in increased costs, morbidity, and mortality when they spread outside of the gut. Clostridium difficile
shares many of the same characteristics as MDROs and along with MDROs has been labeled by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention as a national priority. No group suffers more from these intestinal MDROs
than nursing home residents. The perfect storm of a vulnerable group of frail older adults living in close
communities, with increased morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections, and corresponding high rates of
MDRO colonization emphasize the importance of the nursing home as a priority setting for studies to reduce
MRDO burden. The intestinal microbiome may be a key factor as it influences both the likelihood of de novo
colonization and whether colonization results in disease. In this proposal we will: 1) determine carriage rates of
key MDROs in nursing homes communities using novel rapid strain-specific technology (molecular inversion
probes); 2) assess the dissemination of pathogenic organisms; 3) determine in vivo/vitro how an aging
microbiome can induce intestinal inflammation, thus promoting MDRO colonization; and 4) determining the
extent to which both microbial dysbiosis and immunosenescence increases the risk of MDRO colonization,
infection, and worsening frailty. We hypothesize that environmental and clinical factors (e.g., medication)
characteristic of the NH settings contribute to and shape a dysbiotic microbiome that favors an increased risk of
MDRO colonization. We further hypothesize the extent of microbial dysbiosis will be the major contributor of
MDRO colonization, thus providing a novel target to combat pathogen prevalence within the NH environment.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will develop and implement a cultivation-free, high-throughput, low-cost approach to
provide deep strain-level resolution of MDROs and accelerate epidemiological studies of infectious diseases.
Further we will derive a microbiome-based predictive tool, the NH-MDI, to assess individual risk of MDRO
colonization. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which the microbiome can influence epithelial
homeostasis, thus providing a colonic microenvironment supportive of MDRO colonization. Aim 3 will include
analysis of stool and blood samples from a prospective nursing home cohort in order to determine the relative
contribution of aging microbiome dysbiosis to markers of immunosenescence for increased risk of MDRO
colonization as well as risk of worsening frailty. Further, we will determine the extent that dysbiosis and
immunosenescence correlates with risk of future infection over 18 months of follow-up. Defining these crucial
parameters will provide the basis for development of novel microbiome therapeutics aimed at the prevention of
nursing home infections and promoting healthy aging. In doing so, we will further develop novel approaches to
identify infectious organisms that will be superior to current diagnostic methods."

O2 uptake in the lung and O2 delivery peripherally depend on the efficient matching of blood flow to regional O2
availability in the lung and O2 consumption in tissues. To achieve this matching, red blood cell (RBC) hemoglobin
allostery regulates not only trans-erythrocytic O2 flux but also RBC export of vasoactive mediators that respond
to O2 demand. RBCs export vasoregulatory ATP basally and in response to O2 deficit. This RBC-based vascular
control of the uptake and delivery of O2 may be disrupted by endogenous (e.g., in sepsis) and exogenous (via
storage for transfusion) RBC injuries. Septic persons with moderate anemia are frequently transfused, but
infrequently benefit. Yet conversely any anemia is a negative risk factor. Lung morbidity is frequent after RBC
transfusion, possibly due to impaired RBC ability to export ATP, disrupting O2 uptake via pulmonary RBC-
endothelial adhesion. We show in septic mice (cecal ligation/puncture, CLP) that the RBC’s ability to produce
and export ATP is impaired. We will test the hypothesis that the O2-transport dysfunction in sepsis is
mediated in part by impaired export by RBCs of vasoregulatory ATP, a dysfunction compounded by
transfused RBCs, exacerbating acute lung injury (ALI) and hypoxemia, by achieving these Aims: Aim 1.
Determine the role of RBC ATP export in mortality and ALI in a mouse model of sepsis and transfusion.
Exchange transfusion of CLP RBCs into healthy mice exposed to hypoxia drives mortality. RBC ATP export
takes place via pannexin 1 (Px1). We will determine the role and mechanism of depressed RBC ATP export via
Px1 in the mortality, ALI, and O2 transport responses to sepsis (CLP or severe influenza) and transfusion in mice
using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Aim 2. Determine the influence of augmenting transfusate
RBC ATP content and/or export on organ function and O2 transport in septic mice. RBC ATP export can
be augmented via clinically available approaches: hypoxic RBC storage; transfusate incubation with PIPA
(phosphate, inosine, pyruvate, adenine) solution that preserves stored-RBC ATP and DPG; or using an activator
of RBC pyruvate kinase (PKR), which augments RBC ATP with little effect on DPG or P50. We will test these
approaches to augment or preserve RBC ATP content on ATP export in mice transfused during sepsis. Aim 3.
Determine the influence of human sepsis on RBC vasoregulatory function ex vivo, and the functional
influence of candidate modulators of ATP content and export in septic RBCs. We validated a novel RBC
cryopreservation scheme with superior phenotype fidelity. We built a unique biobank of RBC specimens from
septic children and adults. We prospectively sampled over 150 patients with severe sepsis; most subjects have
ALI. We will determine the influence of translation-ready lead candidates identified in Aim 2 to augment RBC
ATP export on key RBC respiratory functions: vasoactivity, anti-adhesivity, and O2 transport. We will model the
effects of transfusate intervention in admixed septic and stored RBCs. Our novel focus on disrupted signaling by
RBCs will produce novel, practical, and relevant insight into respiratory dysfunction in sepsis and transfusion."
10800727,"Children who experience prenatal alcohol exposure may develop Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)
and the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly susceptible to alcohol-induced damage. Children of FASD
have significant neurobehavioral deficits. FASD is diagnosed at an alarmingly high rate making it the most
common non-heritable cause of mental disability and resulting in tremendous personal and societal costs. It is
therefore important to understand mechanisms that contribute to these adverse effects and find ways to improve
outcomes in these individuals. The neurobehavioral deficits observed in FASD results from structural damages
in the brain. It has been well-established that there is a temporal and spatial vulnerability to alcohol-induced
neuronal damage during the development. That is, neurons at the different developmental stage display
differential sensitivity to alcohol-induced damage. Even at the same developmental stage, neurons in different
structures are differentially impacted by alcohol exposure. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle involved in protein quality control. The accumulation
of improperly folded proteins within the ER lumen results in ER stress, and sustained ER stress causes cell
death. Neuronal cells are particularly sensitive to ER stress. Recently it is shown that ER stress plays an
important and more specific role in alcohol-induced CNS damage. The ability of immature neurons to maintain
ER homeostasis develops gradually and heterogeneously. We hypothesize that the temporal and spatial
vulnerability of developing brain to alcohol-induced neuronal damage is mediated by the sensitivity to ER stress.
That is, the differential sensitivity of neurons to alcohol neurotoxicity during the development is due to the
difference of neuronal ability to maintain ER homeostasis and mitigate ER stress. We further hypothesize that
enhancing neuronal ability to maintain ER homeostasis will make immature neurons resistant to alcohol-induced
neurodegeneration and improve neurobehavioral deficits. We propose three specific aims to test these
hypotheses. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether the temporal and spatial vulnerability to alcohol-induced
neuronal damage is mediated by the sensitivity to ER stress in the developing brain. Specific Aim 2 will determine
whether enhancing neuronal ability to maintain ER homeostasis can protect immature neurons against alcohol-
induced ER stress and neurodegeneration in the developing brain. Specific Aim 3 will determine whether
enhancing neuronal ability to maintain neuronal ER homeostasis can improve alcohol-induced neurobehavioral
deficits. This proposal will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate how ER stress contributes to
neuronal vulnerability to alcohol. It will employ genetic manipulations and chemical intervention by FDA-approved
drugs to mitigate ER stress in immature neurons. The cohesive specific aims will not only elucidate the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying the temporal and spatial vulnerability to alcohol, but also open a novel
avenue for the intervention/therapy of FASD."
10770480,"Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit."
10794342,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and is an important therapeutic target.
While antioxidants or agents that target the reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been investigated for treating
OA, many have demonstrated common disadvantages such as poor bioavailability and stability, as well as rapid
joint clearance or release profiles from delivery vehicles following intra-articular injections. Therefore, there exists
a critical need to localize and retain therapeutic levels of antioxidants within joint tissues for protection against
the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. This proposal explores the application of manganese dioxide
nanoparticles (MnO2 NPs) with antioxidant enzyme-like activity to reduce oxidative stress in OA joints while
addressing limitations of small molecule antioxidants and natural enzymes, such as cost and stability. In addition,
the properties of these nanomaterials can be tailored for tissue retention and cell targeting, which is important
for addressing critical barriers to therapeutic localization and uptake in joint tissues. Recently, we reported
engineering MnO2 NPs for uptake into cartilage and prolonged joint retention in vivo, as well as reduction of
inflammation-induced oxidative stress in cartilage in vitro. Given its limited capacity to regenerate, cartilage is
particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and represents a crucial yet challenging tissue target. As such, this
proposal focuses on interrogating the mechanisms of MnO2 NP-mediated chondroprotection while testing the
efficacy of MnO2 NPs in an in vivo disease model. The central hypothesis is that MnO2 NPs will alleviate oxidative
stress after joint injury and prevent or delay the onset of OA. In Aim 1, we will examine how uptake mechanisms
and intracellular localization of MnO2 NPs affect compartment-specific ROS scavenging and the ability to rescue
specific antioxidant pathways in chondrocytes. Furthermore, the effects of intracellular targeting versus
extracellular retention on redox signaling, chondroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects will be determined.
In Aim 2, we will evaluate the effects of MnO2 NP treatment on oxidative stress and OA progression in vivo in a
rat model of post-traumatic OA (PTOA). We will comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of the particles in
modulating ROS in vivo, mitigating OA-related histological and biochemical (synovial fluid) changes, and
alleviating OA-related pain and disability via behavioral assays. The proposed work will advance a new ROS
scavenging strategy for the treatment of PTOA that overcomes persistent challenges with the delivery of
antioxidants. The proposed work will also reveal key mechanisms involved in intracellular delivery to
chondrocytes and how location and timing of antioxidant delivery impacts disease mechanisms. The mechanistic
and comprehensive approach we propose here to characterize the effects of ROS scavenging by MnO2 NPs
may facilitate successful translation long-term of this and/or other antioxidant strategies for joint injuries and
disease."
10758623,"SUMMARY
It is critically important to establish the causes of organ-specific metastasis; without this knowledge, prevention
and timely treatment of metastatic cancer will likely remain limited. This application aims to develop novel
mathematical models to understand how a rewired cellular metabolism enables cancer cells that originate in
one organ such as the breast to colonize distal organs such as the lung, the brain, and the bone, which have
distinct microenvironments. We will study metabolic rewiring in parental cells and their metastatic derivatives
and ask how metabolic gradients in the primary tumor can generate and maintain diverse lineages with specific
metabolic adaptations for organ-specific metastasis. Our central hypotheses are 1) that metabolic adaptations
are key to the match between the seed (the disseminated cell) and the soil (the distal site) in metastatic breast
cancer, and 2) that the metabolic microenvironment in a primary tumor drives metabolically diverse
subpopulations. The hypotheses have been formulated based on 1) published data detailing metabolic
heterogeneity and that metabolic adaptations can promote metastasis, 2) preliminary data and analysis of RNA
expression, metabolomics, and flux measurements, revealing different metabolic adaptations in breast tumor
cells that home to different tissues, and 3) preliminary data showing that metastatic lineages respond
differently to hypoxia and nutrient gradients, indicating a role for the metabolic microenvironment in maintaining
diverse subpopulations within the same heterogeneous primary tumor. Mathematical modeling is critical to
integrate experimental data and infer changes in metabolic fluxes that cannot be directly measured. The
application proposes a research strategy that combines experimental, clinical, and mathematical analysis to
identify new vulnerabilities in metastatic cancer cells. We will also develop novel mathematical models to study
the ecological interactions between cell lines and their microenvironment and determine the conditions that
lead to coexistence of metabolically distinct pre-metastatic subpopulations in the primary tumor."
10896125,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Radiotherapy can be a highly effective treatment for many types of cancers. A major impediment to achieving its
full curative promise is the current delivery process, where typically the originally planned tumor area is exposed
to a fixed pattern of ionizing radiation over time irrespective of target deformations, organ motion, or function. To
avoid misses, geometric uncertainties in this feedforward process are dealt with by increasing the planning
margin around the tumor, but of necessity result in unnecessary exposure of uninvolved tissue which can lead
to debilitating toxicities. We hypothesize that the unwanted radiation dose to normal tissues could be significantly
reduced by using a feedback system that would “know” the shape and location of the tumor as well as the location
and intensity of the irradiated dose during delivery. This framework would require the unique ability to
simultaneously image the absorbed dose and the targeted tumor anatomy during radiation delivery, which is not
possible with currently existing technologies.
 A known phenomenon in radiation physics is the generation of acoustic waves due to thermal expansion of
a substance following the absorption of penetrating radiation. Detection of this radiation induced acoustic signal
from clinical treatment beams has been recently demonstrated but has not been clinically realized. That signal
exists “for free” in real time as a consequence of the treatment beam. The signal can be measured with
ultrasound detectors and processed to reveal the location and intensity of the deposited energy/dose.
Furthermore, ultrasound technologies have also long been established for medical imaging and monitoring of
tumor size, shape and location, without introducing ionizing radiation.
 Therefore, we propose to combine measurements of radiation acoustics and ultrasound imaging in an
integrated system using advanced matrix array probes to determine in real-time the volumetric delivered
radiation dose with respect to that day's tumor shape and location, and ultimately to optimize tumor targeting via
online feedback. The system will be optimized in phantoms and preclinical models. Then, its feasibility and
versatility will be tested for treatment of tumors in the liver and the pancreas, two aggressive cancer sites where
misplaced dose due to deformation and physiological motion not only compromises tumor eradication but also
affects vital functions in the patient and subsequent treatment outcomes.
Impact statement: We aim to implement new, safe, simple, cost effective technology and methods for online
guidance of radiotherapy delivery that can provide simultaneous tumor tracking and dose compensation
capabilities. These technologies will be evaluated in a pilot clinical study of liver and pancreatic cancers to
demonstrate feasibility and potentials for translation. If successful, this feedback technology will have a
significant impact on personalizing radiotherapy delivery and achieving optimal treatment outcomes."
10844354,"Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) control most types of immune responses. Recently, distinct
compartments of tissue-localized Tregs that help maintain local homeostasis were also discovered. These so-
called “tissue-Tregs” have transcriptomes, TCR repertoires and growth/survival factor dependencies that differ
from those of lymphoid-organ Tregs and of Tregs in other tissues. Tissue-Tregs regulate non-immunological
processes such as metabolism and regeneration via influences on innate and adaptive immunocytes as well as
on local stromal and parenchymal cells. A paradigmatic tissue-Treg compartment, first reported by the PI's lab
in 2009, is that found in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), especially the epidydimal VAT (eVAT) depot of lean mice.
eVAT Tregs, which depend on the supreme regulator of adipogenesis, PPARγ, for effective accrual and function,
help assure local and systemic metabolism, notably insulin sensitivity. This important function is known to reflect
direct eVAT-Treg influences on local immunocytes and on eVAT-resident, immunocyte-promoting mesenchymal
stromal cells (VmSCs). The focus of this proposed project is on a newly discovered function of eVAT Tregs. Our
preliminary data, primarily derived from transcriptomic analyses and in vitro adipogenesis assays, indicate that
they control the differentiation of stroma-resident adipocyte precursor cells into mature adipocytes (and
potentially adipocyte turnover and fibrosis). Moreover, these data point to Oncostatin M (OSM) as a potential
mediator of these influences. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THIS PROPOSED PROJECT IS TO ELUCIDATE THE
AVENUES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN eVAT Tregs AND ADIPOCYTE PRECURSORS. We propose:
(1) To determine the extent to which OSM production by eVAT-Tregs is responsible for their constraint of stroma-
resident adipocyte precursors. This Aim addresses the need to validate our transcriptomic and in vitro
adipogenesis data with in vivo examinations.
(2) To evaluate the effects of aging on eVAT-Treg control of local inflammation and adipogenesis. Discrepancies
in the literature imply that the impact of eVAT Tregs may be very different in aging vs old mice. We propose to
evaluate this notion in a head-to-head comparison of mice specifically lacking eVAT-Tregs or not.
(3) To determine whether and how eVAT-Treg control of adipocyte differentiation shows sexual dimorphism.
Male and female rodents and humans differ in the deposition and function of their adipose tissue. A recent report
(on which the PI's lab collaborated) highlights a male:female dichotomy in IL-33-producing, immunocyte-
promoting VmSCs, leading to a dimorphism in gonadal VAT accrual. Our preliminary data uncovered a difference
in adipocyte dynamics as well, which is the focus of this Aim.
Upon successful completion of this proposed project, we should know in what contexts eVAT-Tregs regulate
adipocyte dynamics and how they do so. This represents a novel function of eVAT Tregs, one that fits within the
emerging theme of tissue-Treg control of stem/progenitor cell activities."

We will conduct an open-label double-blind group assignment clinical trial testing serum “adipokine” proteins
as the mediators of the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication donepezil (Aricept®)’s effect
on the latent dementia severity metric “δ”. Adipokines are inflammatory proteins released by adipose tissues
and recently associated with cognitive decline. Our intent is to demonstrate multiple potential improvements in
the conduct of any future dementia-related clinical trial. For example, the use of telephone assessment
minimizes recruitment and assessment costs and protects participants from potential SARS-cov-2 exposure.
The entire protocol could be administered by telephone, if necessary, in subjects unvaccinated against
SARS-cov-2. In prior work, we have established the latent variable “δ” (for dementia) as a dementia-specific
cognitive phenotype. We will use δ to equate study groups on their baseline dementia severity and set the
recruitment threshold to maximize the potential for reversions back across δ’s dementia conversion threshold
if treatment is effective. We will deploy a novel “Line of identity (LOI)” algorithm to further select cases most
likely to benefit from our intervention (an example of precision medicine). We will use a second latent
dementia severity metric (dTEL) as a comprehensive dementia-specific outcome. Finally, we will test a latent
adipokine biomarker construct as a mediator of donepezil’s effect on δ. That will potentially establish a novel
mechanism for acetylcholinesterase inhibition."
10745925,"Immunomodulatory agents blocking the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 (PD) pathway have shown remarkable
clinical benefits and constitute a new standard of care for cancer treatment. The success of these agents is due
to the prominent immunosuppressive function of the PD-1 receptor alongside the selective expression of its
ligand, PD-L1, in the tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to a favorable efficacy-to-toxicity ratio. However,
despite the vast advances provided by anti-PD therapy, only a subset of patients develops a long-term response,
illustrating the need for identifying new immune modulators in the TME, especially in PD-L1 negative tumors. To
achieve this, we built the first genome-scale T-cell activity screen of human membrane proteins and identified
Siglec-15 as a critical immune suppressor with broad upregulation on various cancer types and a new target for
cancer immunotherapy. Siglec-15 has unique molecular features compared with many other known checkpoint
inhibitory ligands. It shows dominant expression on cancer cells, besides tumor-associated macrophages, and
exhibits PD-L1 mutually exclusive expression pattern in human cancers. Siglec-15 blockade by a monoclonal
antibody shows therapeutic efficacy in mouse tumor models and human cancer cell culture systems and results
in amplified T cell responses. Siglec-15 may represent a novel class of immune checkpoint ligands with tumor-
associated expression and divergent mechanisms of action to PD-L1, with important implications for anti-PD
unresponsive patients. Based on these results, we have developed an anti-human Siglec-15 antibody (NC318)
with the related phase I/II clinical trials currently ongoing for PD-1 refractory metastatic solid cancers. Although
the preliminary clinical trial results are quite promising, the clear elucidation of the immune suppressive
mechanism of Siglec-15 in the tumor-microenvironment will advance the clinical translation of this novel program.
Other than modulating T cell function, our new findings also suggest that Siglec-15 represents a potential novel
axis of control for myeloid cells, a key immune cell subset critical in shaping the tumor microenvironment which
have a relative lack of successful clinical targets. Beyond this, important questions remain to optimize Siglec-15-
related therapy, such as its receptor(s), induction mechanisms, and potential additive effects or synergies with
existing treatments. In this project, through two complementary aims, we will leverage our expertise in cancer
immunology and immunotherapy to: 1) determine the potential immune function of Siglec-15 beyond T cells,
particularly on myeloid cells, and to characterize functional Siglec-15 receptors on both myeloid cells and T cells;
2) examine the role of oncogenic KRAS mutants as induction mechanism of Siglec-15 expression on cancer
cells and identify better anti-Siglec-15 combinatorial therapies using two oncogenic KRAS mutant-associated
syngeneic orthotopic mouse models of pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Collectively, our proposed studies will
facilitate our understanding of a novel PD-L1 mutually exclusive immune checkpoint and enhance Siglec-15-
based therapeutic approaches for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 insensitive cancers."

Childhood cancers are the consequence of failed normal development. Medulloblastoma (MB), a malignant
embryonal tumor of the cerebellum, exemplifies a highly aggressive pediatric cancer driven by aberrant activation
of neurodevelopmental pathways and disruption of neuronal differentiation programs. Genomics has effectively
divided MB into biologically and clinically distinct consensus molecular subgroups, including WNT, SHH, Group
3, and Group 4. Mouse tumor modeling studies have substantiated the cellular origins of WNT- and SHH-MB. In
contrast, the developmental basis of Group 3/4-MB remains poorly understood, hampering context-relevant
mechanistic studies, generation of accurate disease models, and the advancement of molecularly targeted
therapies urgently needed to improve patient outcomes. Recent single-cell genomics studies lead by PI Northcott
and others have provided initial clues into the putative origins of Group 4-MB, the largest and least characterized
MB subgroup, implicating multiple glutamatergic lineages born out of the upper rhombic lip germinal zone.
However, these studies failed to confidently identify cerebellar correlates of Group 3-MB, the most clinically
challenging MB subgroup. Decoding the interplay between cellular lineages of the developing cerebellum and
Group 3/4-MB pathogenesis represents a fundamental challenge in the field and will be the primary objective of
this research program. We hypothesize that Group 3/4-MB tumors arise from discrete lineage trajectories during
early cerebellar development. Solving the developmental origins of Group 3/4-MB will provide essential
knowledge required to (i) investigate context-specific mechanisms of tumorigenesis; (ii) inform preclinical
modeling strategies; (iii) identify previously hidden oncogenic drivers; and (iv) illuminate novel therapeutic
opportunities. This hypothesis will be tested in three conceptually and technically innovative Specific Aims that
integrate a multidisciplinary and multispecies experimental approach. In Aim #1, we will leverage an
unprecedented single-cell transcriptional atlas of murine cerebellar development and elegant lineage enrichment
strategies to enable cross-species inference of MB subgroup origins and execute context-relevant experimental
perturbation of MB driver genes. In Aim #2, we will deliver the first comprehensive investigation of MB cellular
origins through the lens of human fetal cerebellar development. These analyses will enlighten species-specific
differences in cerebellar development linked to tumorigenesis and foster the discovery of tumor-specific
signatures driving malignancy. In Aim #3, we will use focused CRISPR targeting, acute protein degradation, and
next-generation synthetic gene regulators to define developmentally linked transcriptional dependencies in high-
risk MB. These studies will credential conserved master transcription factors as attractive leads for future
therapeutic consideration. Successful execution of this research program will fill an essential knowledge gap
associated with the known biological and clinical heterogeneity of Group 3/4-MB and provide a novel direction
for the pursuit of more specific, less toxic treatment options for affected children."
10892018,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid therapy is commonly prescribed for patients with chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, but offers questionable
benefit for long-term pain management and is associated with arrhythmias, overdose, and death. Individuals with chronic
pain experience high rates of comorbid chronic insomnia, arousal, and abnormal brain activation in response to painful
stimuli. Research shows individuals with chronic pain exhibit increased brain activation in regions associated with pain
modulation in response to painful stimuli compared to healthy controls. Withdrawal from opioids is difficult; and
inadequately managed pain contributes to that difficulty. The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress (CATS) tests the
hypothesis that poor sleep and arousal lead to critical changes in brain activation that increase pain severity and lead to
opioid use. Research shows cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I, an evidence based intervention for chronic
insomnia) improves sleep, arousal, abnormal brain activation, and pain in individuals with comorbid chronic pain and
insomnia, but does not reduce opioid use. However, because CBT-I improves each of the mediators hypothesized to
contribute to opioid use, it warrants examination as a neoadjuvant to gradual tapering of opioid medication. The proposed
trial tests the novel hypothesis that improving sleep and decreasing arousal will lead to normalized brain activation and
decreased pain prior to gradual tapering, which will facilitate reduced opioid use. This hypothesis is supported by theory
(CATS) and empirical findings. It also reflects federal pain research priorities.
Trial Design. 165 adults who use prescription opioid users (18+ years of age) and have chronic pain and insomnia will be
randomized to CBT-I or Sleep Hygiene and Related Education (SHARE). They will then undergo a gradual tapered
withdrawal protocol for opioids. Outcomes (sleep, arousal, brain activation, pain, opioid use, opioid related problems) will
be examined at baseline (BL), post intervention (P1), post withdrawal (P2), and 6-month follow-up. Specific Aims 1 and 2
test the impact of CBT-I on sleep, arousal, brain activation, pain, opioid use, and opioid related problems compared to the
active SHARE control. Specific Aims 3 and 4 test the impact of tapering opioid use following CBT-I on sleep, arousal,
brain activation, pain, opioid use, and opioid related problems compared to the combined SHARE and tapered withdrawal
control. An Exploratory Aim examines the relationships between changes in the mechanistic outcomes and changes in the
opioid outcomes, and their potential moderators (e.g., craving, withdrawal symptoms, sex, age, race, ethnicity).
Public Health Implications: Demonstration that a relatively brief behavioral sleep intervention facilitates tapered
withdrawal from opioid medication and protects against relapse through improvements in sleep, arousal, abnormal brain
activation, and pain has important implications for the millions of individuals living with chronic pain, their families,
communities, and healthcare."
10909008,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aerosolization of viruses from patients with respiratory infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza, is a major
concern in healthcare because these viruses can put healthcare personnel (HCP) and patients at risk of
infection. The rationale for this study is that while epidemiology studies have identified some healthcare
activities as posing a high risk to HCP and these activities are thought to generate aerosols, there exists very
limited information about the concentration and size distribution of infectious virus in the aerosol. As a result, it
remains difficult to identify aerosol-generating healthcare activities and to distinguish those that pose a high
risk to HCP and patients. The long-term goal of this research is to prevent the transmission of viral diseases
through respiratory aerosol. Three aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to develop and evaluate a size-selective
method to assess viable virus in aerosol. Commercially available size-selective inlets meeting health-based
sampling conventions will be evaluated for use with an innovative instrument, the Viable Virus Aerosol Sampler
(VIVAS, Aerosol Devices, Inc.), with reference aerosols and bacteriophage MS2. Aim 2 is to characterize the
concentration and size distribution of viable virus aerosol generated from healthcare activities.One or more
inlet from Aim 1 will be deployed alongside conventional aerosol sampling equipment to measuresize-selected
viable virus, size-selected virus genetic material, and aerosol number and size distribution in rooms with
influenza or COVID-19 patients. Six healthcare activities will be studied, each with 6-9 observationsfor COVID-
19 patients and 6-9 observations for influenza patients. These activities will be selected based on preliminary
aerosol characterization of 15 activities. The primary hypothesis of Aim 2 is that the variance in respiratory
aerosol is greater among healthcare activities than within healthcare activities, and does not vary between
viruses, which implies that some activities generate more or different aerosol than others. The secondary
hypothesis of Aim 2 is that therethe ratio of virus gene copies to viable virus in respiratory aerosol does not
vary within or among healthcare activities, which, if true, means that the viable virus concentration can be
reliably inferred from PCR results. Aim 3 is to link aerosol properties to patient, procedure, and environmental
characteristics. The primary hypothesis of Aim 3 is that the variance in respiratory aerosol characteristics
explained by environmental, patient, and healthcare activity characteristics is small relative to variation within
and among healthcare activities, which reflects that limited variation in environmental and patient
characteristics are expected owing to the performance of this research in a healthcare facility and among
hospitalized patients. The knowledge generated through this research will greatly enhance our understanding
ofthe risks posed by viruses in respiratory aerosol. Infection preventionists will be able to use this knowledge to
educate HCP, and to select control strategies that permit HCP to perform their jobs safely and efficiently. The
outcome of this research will be evidence-based infection prevention practices for aerosol-generating activities."

 Cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, adiposity, and type 2
diabetes, represent a major public health burden that disproportionately affects diverse (non-European
ancestry) populations. Cardiometabolic traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental (lifestyle)
factors. Therefore, understanding interactions (GxE) between these factors could provide insights into
intervention, prevention and therapeutic strategies to reduce the burden of disease. Many genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have made important genetic discoveries for many complex traits through
approaches based on “genetic main effects”. However, genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) are still
limited. The objective of this study is therefore to identify novel genetic loci associated with cardiometabolic
traits through GWIS in large samples, to investigate gene-lifestyle interactions in the cardiometabolic trait loci,
and to characterize the molecular effects underlying the interactions by leveraging existing “Omics” data such
as DNA methylation, gene expression, and metabolites. By investigating genomic and lifestyle contributors to
health outcomes through their interactions across diverse populations and between sexes, our proposal
reflects the priorities of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) whose focus is the interplay between
lifestyle/environment and genetics, with an emphasis on diverse populations.
We propose to evaluate gene-lifestyle interactions across diverse populations (European, African, Hispanic,
and Asian). Our recent progress with blood pressure, lipids, and dichotomized lifestyle factors (smoking,
alcohol consumption, physical activity, educational attainment, psychosocial factors, and sleep) encountered
limited statistical power. Therefore, we propose to vastly increase the power for GWIS with an ~10-fold larger
sample size and expand our focus to include other cardiometabolic traits (adiposity and diabetes traits),
quantitative lifestyle exposures (e.g., cigarettes per day), and aggregate Lifestyle Risk Scores as an overall
lifestyle risk factor for cardiometabolic health; evaluate the impact of identified interactions on clinical endpoints
(like coronary heart disease); assess the druggability of identified interactions; and characterize interactions
using multiple omics data. Our proposal includes our recent discovery studies (N~130,000), our recent
replication studies (N~252,000), and the addition of several new, substantially larger studies including the
Million Veteran Program (N~234,000), the UK Biobank (N~478,000), the Biobank Japan (N~160,000), and the
Study of Latinos (N~13,000), among others. The overall sample, including 912,000 European, 91,000 African,
33,000 Hispanic, and 231,000 Asian ancestry individuals, represents the most significant effort to date to
investigate interactions with an aggregate sample size of about 1.267 million. Findings can lead to new
diagnostic and therapeutic tools, contribute to precision care in the management of cardiometabolic disorders,
and provide insights for the PMI with the ultimate goal of enhancing clinical practice."

Asthma remains a prevalent public health concern that disproportionately affects children living in urban low-
income settings. Previous studies have identified multiple pathobiological subtypes (i.e., endotypes) of
childhood asthma, notably the airway Type 2 inflammation high (T2-high) asthma endotype. Endotypic
understanding of asthma has led to better asthma management through personalized therapy. Yet, asthma
endotype research is still in its infancy, and the pathobiologic mechanisms driving disease in many children
remains to be determined. In particular, the timing and mechanisms of airway endotype development and
relationships to lung dysfunction are unexplored. The University of Colorado School of Medicine CAUSE
Clinical Research Center project WINDOWS seeks to identify critical windows in airway endotype development
that lead to lung dysfunction and disease, providing potential targets for asthma prevention. WINDOWS is an
early-life longitudinal cohort study of high-risk urban children that maps the molecular steps in the development
of airway endotypes, which lead to early-life lung function deficits, and eventually persistent childhood asthma.
We are recruiting toddlers age 1.5-3 years from urban, low-income families with a history of at least three
wheezing or asthma episodes requiring treatment to enrich for children at highest risk of asthma persistence.
They will be followed over four years with annual airway molecular endotyping and lung function assessments
to age 6-7 years, when persistent asthma status will be ascertained. Sequential RNA sequencing of nasal
airway samples obtained during early childhood will reveal new insights into the mechanisms underlying both
T2-high and non-T2-high asthma, which will be coupled with measures of airway obstruction using the forced
oscillation technique and impedance pneumography. Comparing subjects that do and do not develop asthma
will allow us to distinguish airway endotype and lung function phenotype features associated with progression
from an early life high risk state to childhood asthma. The aims of WINDOWS are to 1) characterize trajectories
of lung function and progression of wheezing phenotypes from early life through childhood in a cohort of
toddlers at high risk for developing childhood asthma; 2) transcriptionally characterize the airway epithelium
from early life through childhood in toddlers at high risk for developing childhood asthma; and 3) determine the
relationship between airway transcriptome profiles and measures of lung function in early life and how these
early life molecular and physiologic features relate to the clinical characteristic of childhood asthma.
WINDOWS will provide insights into the role of airway dysfunction in the development of childhood asthma by
using innovative methods to investigate airway biology and physiology in early life, which will fill the gap in
understanding airway resilience and asthma prevention."
10878699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A resurgence of research interest in bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, is driving the development of
engineered phages for biomedical applications, including antimicrobial therapy and phage-based vaccination.
As antimicrobial agents, phages have significant advantages over conventional antibiotics: they are well-
tolerated, pathogen-specific, and replicate at the site of infection. Phages are also promising as vaccine
platforms because they can be precisely engineered to deliver multiple foreign antigens. However, phages are
immunogenic and both applications are susceptible to interfering immune responses. Antimicrobial phages, for
example, can elicit neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection of the bacterial target. This immunogenic
nature is advantageous for vaccine development, since the phage acts as its own adjuvant, but it comes at a
price: off-target responses to immunodominant phage antigens can distract from intended protective responses
to foreign antigens. Unfortunately, data on phage immunology are limited, confounding routine biomedical
applications of phage. This proposal outlines basic experiments to elucidate the basis of phage
immunogenicity and evaluate methods of modulating it.
Aim 1 will develop a structural map of antibody binding to three therapeutic mycobacteriophages. Structure-
guided engineering and directed evolution will be used to generate mutant phages that escape antibody
binding. The ability of these mutants to evade established immune responses to their wild-type counterparts in
vivo will be evaluated in a mouse model. In Aim 2 the same phages will be used as platforms for a therapeutic
bacterial vaccine. Leveraging both phage display and phage DNA vector technologies, the vaccine candidates
will defend and protect against bacteria with three mechanisms: 1) phage infection and killing, 2) generation of
bacterium-binding antibodies, and 3) activation of helper and cytotoxic T cells. Aim 3 will evaluate a method to
suppress interfering immune responses: co-administration of phage with rapamycin-loaded nanoparticles. This
will down-regulate phage-specific helper T cells and upregulate regulatory T cells, training the immune system
to recognize phage as ‘self’. These Aims will expand our understanding of phage immunogenicity and assess
the potential to improve phage-based medicine with principles from immunoengineering. Furthermore, Aim 1 is
a training vehicle for the candidate, who has developed immunology experience in the lab but requires
mentored training and formal education to establish independence in this field. Aim 1 also provides additional
mentored training in structural biology, specifically asymmetric reconstructions of phage-antibody complexes.
With the planned scientific training, practice in publishing and grant writing, and the support of her mentors
throughout an academic job search, the candidate is expected to establish and sustain an independent
research career focused on immunoengineering phage to improve their biomedical applications."

Organ transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage organ disease; however, there is a severe shortage
of donor organs whereby only ~36% of wait-listed patients receive a transplant. At the same time, many vital
organs that may be transplantable are discarded - some estimates suggest that up to 25% of recovered organs are
not ultimately transplanted, and there are additional pools of unrecovered organs that are only marginally
damaged. However, because of their uncertain viability and the high cost of an unsuccessful transplant, none of
these potential organs are used while transplantation of just a fraction could dramatically reduce the organ
shortage.
A particularly large target of untapped donor organs are marginally injured warm ischemic organs from
Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD). While these organs have been correlated to lower survival rates and
increased post-transplant complications, machine perfusion technology holds the promise of reconditioning
some of these organs, thereby dramatically increasing availability. However, a critical bottleneck that impacts
experimental and clinical advances in reconditioning organs are developing non-objective metrics that can
definitively ascertain if an organ is viable prior to transplantation. Clinically, since organ allocation is already
severely restricted by time, these criteria need to be defined for each organ rapidly and preferably in real-time.
Experimentally, access to flexible platforms would increase the scale and number of researchers that can tackle
these difficult problems. In response to this need, we propose to develop a novel imaging platform that will use
Resonance Raman Spectroscopy (RRS) to quantify mitochondrial redox state on tissue surfaces/biopsies and
mitochondrial breakdown products in the perfusate. Our approach is unique in organ transplantation assessment
since: 1) results are obtained in less than 3 minutes and are non-destructive, and 2) offers the flexibility required
for diverse organ systems, significantly increasing the impact of the proposed work.
While we will target diverse transplantable organs, we focus our initial efforts on liver through execution of two
specific aims. We will develop a benchtop RRS device with the capacity to integrate several types of
measurements on livers, including biopsies, surface measurements, and perfusate samples. In Specific Aim 1, we
will apply and validate the biopsy cell and extendable arm that enables liver biopsies and surface measurements
to calculate the ratio of reduced to total mitochondria (defined as Resonance Raman Reduced Mitochondrial
Ratio, 3RMR). In Specific Aim 2, we will apply and validate the perfusate cell that is compatible with the same
benchtop RRS device to quantify mitochondrial breakdown products in real-time from the perfusate (defined as
the Perfusate Viability Index, PVI). In SA1-2, we will define the 3RMR/PVI threshold values that if exceeded
will indicate irreversible liver injury, beginning with rigorous studies in rodents before measuring samples from
discarded human DCD livers during machine perfusion."
10757923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Statins are the most commonly used cholesterol-lowering medication; however, statins increase the risk of
new-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D). While this increased risk includes a direct effect of statins to impair islet β-
cell function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. With statin use trending up among U.S. adults, there
is an urgent need to better understand how statins lead to demise of the β cell – this knowledge will inform
strategies aimed at reducing progression to T2D in patients on statin therapy. To this end, we have generated
data that show a previously unrecognized effect of statins to promote mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation
within islets. Surprisingly, there is almost no literature on mechanisms regulating mitochondrial cholesterol
content in β cells. This knowledge gap will be addressed in the proposed studies, which focus on the role of
cholesterol transport to mitochondria and its subsequent metabolism in statin-induced β-cell toxicity.
 Mitochondria are cholesterol-poor organelles, and thus are highly sensitive to even small increases in
cholesterol content. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the closely related STARD3 protein
mediate cholesterol transport to mitochondria. We show that both StAR and STARD3 are upregulated in statin-
treated islets. In β cells, StAR overexpression results in mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation, impaired
insulin release and reduced cell viability. Also, our data suggest β cells have limited capacity to metabolize
cholesterol since they express only two of the cytochrome P450 enzymes known to initiate cholesterol
metabolism. Of these, only CYP27A1 is downregulated in islets exposed to statins, and this is accompanied by
an increase in miRNA-204, which can suppress CYP27A1 mRNA. We find that lack of islet CYP27A1 per se
promotes mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation and impaired insulin secretion. Also, we show stimulating
mitophagy to clear cholesterol-laden mitochondria in statin-treated islets protects against β-cell dysfunction.
 Based on our data, we hypothesize that statin-induced aberrations in cholesterol transport and metabolism
lead to mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired insulin release and β-cell
death. The following specific aims will address our hypothesis:
Aim 1: To determine the contributions of transport of cholesterol to mitochondria, its subsequent metabolism,
or clearance of cholesterol-laden mitochondria to statin-induced β-cell dysfunction/death.
Aim 2: To determine whether reducing StAR and/or increasing CYP27A1 expression ameliorates the
detrimental effects of statins on β-cell function and mass in vivo.
Aim 3: To identify miRs that mitigate statin-induced dysregulation of cholesterol transport and metabolism
genes in human islets.
 This research is innovative and significant, as investigating mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation and
miRNAs in statin-induced β-cell dysfunction/death will inform strategies to mitigate the risk of developing T2D."

Atopic disease is a major public health problem affecting up to 20% of the world’s population, with rising
prevalence in recent decades. It is associated with fatal reactions (food allergy), and with significant
psychosocial and financial burden for children and families. Environmental and in utero exposures are known
risk factors, but little is known about the mechanisms through which exposures may confer risk. One of these
known exposures is maternal antenatal anxiety, which has been associated both with elevated markers of
allergy risk (such as levels of Immunoglobluin E (IgE)) and with atopic diagnosis in children. Maternal
antenatal anxiety has also been linked to immune dysregulation in both mothers and children, and elevated
innate immune activity in children at birth may be a key marker of future allergic risk – yet no study has
attempted to link dyadic maternal and neonatal immune dysregulation to allergy risk in the same mother-child
pairs. In this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, we propose to follow 200 mother-child pairs (132 at
risk for clinically significant anxiety and 68 healthy controls) from the second trimester of pregnancy until
infants reach 12 months of age. We hypothesize that women with clinically significant antenatal anxiety will
demonstrate elevated immune activity compared to healthy controls, that stimulated cells and gene expression
from umbilical cord blood in these pregnancies will similarly show evidence of increased immune activity, and
that maternal and child immune activity will be associated with markers of allergy risk in children. We will
measure immune cell populations and cytokines produced by stimulated cells in mothers and children; will
conduct methylation analyses of immune-related genes in the cord blood of children (focusing on known
biomarkers of future allergic risk); will measure atopic dermatitis in children; and will measure IgE to common
allergens and maternal report of food allergic reactions in children. In addition, we will observe mother-child
interactions surrounding feeding to account for elements of the postnatal environment that may contribute to
elevated child allergic risk. Our thorough and rigorous experimental plan will help to illuminate pathways that
contribute to the association between maternal antenatal anxiety and child allergy risk, and may lead to novel
interventions to ameliorate symptoms and risk in both mother and child."

 Nutrition is a key human capital investment, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where
hundreds of millions of children are currently undernourished and well over a billion adults were undernourished
as children. Prior evidence indicates that early-life undernutrition is associated with negative effects on physical
health, schooling attainment, cognitive skills and wage rates in young adulthood. Given that physical health and
cognitive function decline with age, it is important to ask whether early-life nutrition affects the pace of these
declines. This is a critical knowledge gap concerning the lifespan impacts of early-life nutrition. This project will
use unusually rich longitudinal data from an experimental manipulation of nutrition: the Guatemalan Institute of
Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) Nutrition Supplementation Trial Cohort (INSTC). INSTC was
initiated in 1969 as an experimental nutritional-supplementation program and a number of follow-up rounds have
been conducted. Cohort members will be in mature adulthood, 47-64 years of age, during the proposed project,
ages at which biological and cognitive aging is considerable in most LMICs.
 Specifically, the project will explore how experimentally allocated early-life nutritional supplementation affects
levels of socioeconomic, physical-health, and cognitive-function outcomes in mature adulthood (47-64 y) and
changes in these domains from early to mature adulthood. We ask: Do the nutrition intervention impacts
observed earlier in adulthood persist at later ages? Does improved childhood nutrition additionally impact
changes in these outcomes as participants age? We will explore these questions by collecting and analyzing a
comprehensive set of measures of socioeconomic status, physical health and cognitive function, many of which
we have measures in prior waves.
 The proposed study has high potential impact because of the enormous consequences of childhood
undernutrition for the health and human capital of hundreds of millions of people. The research team is uniquely
well qualified to investigate this topic; team members have made major contributions to current knowledge about
the importance of nutrition over the life-course in LMICs. By using appropriate econometrics and life-cycle human
capital models, with full access to the early childhood data, and building on previous studies, the project will
transform our understanding of early-life nutrition and the health, cognitive and socioeconomic outcomes of
mature adulthood."

Industrialization had created widespread pollution, which has been steadily declining in developed countries for
decades. It is unclear whether and how long-lasting effects of environmental exposure persist across generations
and contribute to chronic diseases in later life. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the top chemical on the ATSDR priority
list of hazardous substances. Here we use iAs as a prototype environmental chemical to dissect the epigenetic
inheritance mechanisms in animal models. We focus exclusively on male-lineage exposure to avoid
developmental confounding effects due to in utero exposure. We found that the exposure of male mice to iAs in
drinking water caused glucose intolerance and upregulated hepatic glucose production in F1 females but not in
F1 male offspring. In contrast, paternal iAs decreased liver triglyceride content and circulating free fatty acids
levels in F1 males, but not F1 females. F0 sperm and F1 livers display altered DNA methylation and expression
in genes related to gonadal hormone signaling and lipid metabolism. In the F2 generation from the male-lineage
iAs exposure, mice display reduced adiposity, nutrient malabsorption, and the altered gut microbiome. We
hypothesize that the interplay between estrogen receptor, DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and gut
microbiome accounts for the inter- and transgenerational effects of iAs in metabolic physiology. We will
characterize how paternal iAs exposure alters glucose metabolism in F1 female offspring; address how paternal
iAs exposure alters lipid metabolism in F1 male offspring, and explore how paternal iAs exposure affects nutrient
absorption through altering the gut microbiome in F2 offspring. The mechanistic insights from this study will
advance our understanding of the cross-generational effects of environmental exposure on metabolic physiology
through the disruption of the endocrine system."

Beige adipocyte plasticity refers to the ability to transform between thermogenic active and inactive states in
accordance to environment fluctuations. For example, cold induces the formation of beige adipocytes, while
warm temperature and nutrient excess lead to their disappearance. Previously, we have described the beige
adipocyte renaissance phenomenon that the white adipocytes to be converted to beige adipocytes by cold
indeed have Ucp1 expression history (being Ucp1+-lineage). Interestingly, beige adipocyte renaissance is
regulated by Ucp1--lineage white adipocytes non-cell autonomously.
This proposal will further delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of beige adipocyte plasticity. Aim 1
will investigate the in vivo relevance of HDAC4:PRDM16 complex in Ucp1--lineage white adipocytes that is
relevant to beige adipocyte plasticity. Aim 2 will determine the regulatory mechanisms of HDAC4:PRDM16
complex-dependent gene network at molecular and chromatin levels. Aim 3 will exploit the potential contribution
of extracellular matrix remodeling to the maintenance of Ucp1+-lineage beige adipocytes. Prior researches have
suggested a correlation between activities of beige adipocytes and metabolic fitness in both rodents and humans.
Investigations in this direction may provide novel druggable targets to treat obesity and related metabolic
disorders."
10768650,"Candidate - The following application is intended to initiate the research career of Michele Plewes, PhD,
within the VA Nebraska Iowa Health Care System under the mentorship of John Davis, PhD, a VA Senior
Research Career Scientist and a well-respected, VA-funded reproductive endocrinologist for the past 30 years.
Dr. Plewes received her PhD in Biology in 2018 and is currently completing her postdoctoral training focused
exclusively in reproductive health research, including molecular endocrinology and steroidogenesis.
Environment - The University of Nebraska Medical Center is adjacent to the Omaha VA Medical Center where
strong scientific relationships have been established to complete the proposed studies. The research
environment is collegial and supportive with a multitude of opportunities for collaboration with other research
scientists. Specifically, Dr. Plewes will have the opportunity to discuss and present her work for crucial feedback
and direction from senior VA researchers. In her time as a postdoctoral associate, Dr. Plewes has been invited
to present her novel research findings twice at the VA research seminar series and will continue to seek feedback
from senior VA researchers, including her VA mentors. Research – Dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis and
secretion is a leading cause of infertility in both male and females. Infertility affects 1 in every 6 couples, with
male infertility playing a primary factor in a third of all cases. Moreover, infertility affects about 10 percent of the
female population (6.1 million) in the United States; about 100,000 female Veterans of reproductive age.
Considering the number of men and women who suffer from infertility and secondary affects associated with
dysregulation of sex steroid biogenesis understanding mechanisms that regulate PKA signaling and mobilization
of substrate for steroid production hold great potential to positively impact reproductive health and overall quality
of life. The proposed studies are expected to provide new information about the extramitochondrial role played
by mitochondrial Dynamin-GTPases in regulation of ovarian/testicular steroid synthesis and function. This
research proposal centers on the identification of the molecular mechanisms responsible for transmitting signals
from the outside environment to the mitochondria, initiating changes in mitochondrial structure and function, and
then translating molecular responses into changes in steroid biosynthesis. The proposed aims test the overall
hypothesis that LH/PKA regulation of mitochondria impacts mitochondrial structure, inter-organelle
communication and ultimately steroidogenesis. The central hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims. Aim
1: Determine the role of S-OPA1 in steroidogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that S-OPA1 serves as an AKAP
for PKA in LH-responsive cells. We will also test the hypothesis that mitochondrial PKA signaling is required for
optimal steroidogenesis. Aim 2: Determine the role of OMA1 and S-OPA1 on MICOS (Mitochondrial Contact Site
and Cristae Organizing System) complex and steroidogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that OMA1 and S-
OPA1 regulate mitochondrial MICOS complexes within the IMM and this regulation is essential for optimal
progesterone biosynthesis. In order to measure this, we will have defined mitochondrial parameters including
cristae organization, IMM Supercomplexes assembly, mitochondrial energetics and mitochondrial nucleoid
arrangement. We predict disruption of MICOS complexes in mitochondria will disrupt the mitochondrial
energetics and ultimately disrupt steroidogenesis. This research supports our long-term objectives to fully
understand the mechanisms controlling steroidogenesis of sex steroids. The short-term goals of this research
are to discover how LH/PKA signaling induce changes in mitochondria and cholesterol mobilization for optimal
progesterone and testosterone production."
10786105,"THE ROLE OF EFFEROCYTOSIS IN INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS
Abstract
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the synovial joints which affects 1 in 100 people
globally and millions in the US alone. We noted marked presence of apoptotic cells in the inflamed joints of
arthritic mice. Apoptosis is intricately linked with phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, also known as ‘efferocytosis’.
The current dogma suggests that increased apoptotic cell persistence in tissues inevitably leads to pathology.
However, our data presented in this application suggest that this dogma warrants further testing. First, we show
that systemic injection of apoptotic cells effectively alleviates inflammation in arthritic mice. Further, cell-free
apoptotic cell supernatants or even purified apoptotic cell-released metabolites potently suppress inflammatory
arthritis. Finally, pharmacologic or genetic efferocytosis reduction (not complete ablation) also reduce
inflammation in arthritic mice. Here, we will test the hypothesis that reduced efferocytosis alleviates inflammation
in arthritis through increased release of anti-inflammatory mediators (from uncleared apoptotic cells) and
enhanced corpse processing/degradation (due to reduced corpse load in phagocytes). We will pursue the
following aims: 1. Using mice with pharmacologic or genetic decrease in efferocytosis, we will quantify multiple
disease parameters in arthritis, determine the numbers of apoptotic cells in the inflamed joints, analyze the
phagocyte response, and analyze the metabolomics of reduced cell clearance environments. 2. Generate and
validate a new transgenic mouse model with tissue-specific, inducible reduction of efferocytosis. Our findings
will further our understanding of efferocytosis in homeostasis and inflammation and could open new avenues in
therapeutic designs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis."
10907407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ability to decipher meaning from degraded sounds is critical for everyday hearing. A key strategy to extract
buried signals is to integrate stored acoustic representations with the incoming sound stream. Such top-
down/bottom-up interaction appears to be a fundamental feature in sensory systems. Indeed, disruptions of such
processes may be involved in disorders such as autism and dyslexia. Unfortunately, little is known about the
mechanisms by which top-down information modulates sensory function. Here, we propose a circuit-level
analysis of a massive descending pathway from the auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus (IC) which is thought
to be important for top-down modulation. Although this pathway has been shown to be critical for many processes
important for auditory perception, how it supports such diversity of function is not known.
 During the last funding period, we uncovered an unexpected degree of heterogeneity in this pathway. For
example, we observed that neurons in the two cortical layers from which this pathway is derived, layer 5 (L5)
and layer 6 (L6), have distinct physiological, morphological and connectivity patterns. L5 neurons receive direct
thalamic input, burst when stimulated and send projections containing giant terminals to the lateral cortex (LC)
of the IC. L6 neurons receive sparse local input, but sample from a broad area of the cortex and end in small
terminals on the distal rim of the LC. These data suggest that L5 neurons send a rapid and secure signal to the
LC, while L6 neurons modulate LC function based on broad multisensory integration. We also found that the
corticocollicular projections interdigitate with periodic neurochemical clusters (“patches” and “matrix”) in the LC
and that the presence of this patch/matrix system governs virtually all input and output to and from this structure.
 These findings raise several questions that will be addressed in the current proposal. First, how does the
L5/L6 system interface with the neurochemical and connectional mosaic comprising the LC? To address this
question, we will use machine learning tools to parse the neurochemical cell classes in the LC, and then use a
novel form of Cre-dependent trans-synaptic tracing to map parallel pathways originating in L5 or L6 and ending
at one of the many targets of the LC. Second, we will examine the impact of L5 and L6 terminals on LC neurons
using optical and electrophysiological approaches to determine the relative impacts and geometry of these
inputs. Third, we will determine what messages are sent by L5 and L6 to the LC by imaging their axons in
response to auditory and non-auditory stimulation using a novel microprism-based two-photon imaging approach
in awake mice. We can thus determine if L5 and L6 send distinct messages to the LC, and whether the messages
vary across the patch/matrix topography. Therefore, by leveraging the patch/matrix organization to parse the
dense thicket of inputs and outputs to and from the LC, this work will shed light on mechanisms of top-down
modulation in the auditory system. In doing so, it will provide a paradigm for understanding diseases involving
disruptions in top-down/bottom-up integration, such as dyslexia and autism."
10805398,"Project Summary / Abstract
Rising obesity has led to an unprecedented increase in pre-diabetes (preD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence
in children and adolescents, a worrisome trend amplified by the COVID 19 pandemic. Based on current evidence,
it remains difficult to predict whether children and adolescents with preD will progress to T2D. Our proposal aims
to address key questions in the pathogenesis of T2D, focusing on modifiable risk factors. Leveraging a
collaboration between Boston Children’s Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital,
in partnership with community health centers in the Greater Boston area, we propose to recruit a diverse cohort
of early pubertal youth (ages 7-15, n=300) with preD, elevated BMI (≥95th percentile), a positive family history of
diabetes, and one or more additional risk factors. We propose to combine rigorous annual clinical studies with
convenient remote assessments, to gain a granular understanding of metabolic, hormonal and environmental
factors contributing to T2D pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will test whether measures of glucose homeostasis and
beta cell function differ between youth with preD who progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia
or remain preD. We propose to analyze glycemia and beta cell function using oral GTT and incretin hormone
levels, and assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., continuous glucose monitors and home A1c kits.
In Aim 2, we will test whether fitness level and amount of physical activity differ between youth with preD who
progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia or remain preD. We propose to evaluate fitness level
using detailed clinical assessments, including VO2 max, assessments adaptable to community settings including
grip strength, and free-living assessments using wearables and app-based activity tracking. In Aim 3, we will test
whether evolution of body composition during growth and puberty predicts progression to T2D. We propose to
analyze body composition (total and visceral fat) using DXA, and hepatic fat using echography-based
assessments, gonadal hormones, adrenal androgens, and mediators of growth hormone action, as well as
assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., BMI and app-based dietary surveys. As secondary aims,
we propose to create a data repository to allow evaluation of social and environmental factors contributing to
T2D onset at a consortium level, with measures including social determinants of health, neighborhood and
geographic characteristics (using geocoding techniques), and the environmental exposome. We also propose
the creation of a biological repository to allow multi-omics studies to identify genomic, epigenetic, and/or
metabolomic markers for progression from preD to T2D in youth at a consortium level. We propose to collect a
rich biorepository of longitudinal samples (i.e., plasma, PBMCs, urine, stool, hair) from all participants that will
set the stage for future systems biology-driven studies. Together, these studies will permit development of a
predictive model based on variables easily measurable at the community level, which can then be applied to the
detection and treatment of youth at highest risk of T2D."
10929930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders represent the most prevalent cause of preventable intellectual disability.
Prevalence in high-risk communities in the Western Cape region of South Africa may be as high as 20.9%.
Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) impacts the developing brain, resulting in cognitive deficits, growth restriction
and structural brain changes. Despite psychosocial interventions, heavy drinking during pregnancy continues
to be a major public health challenge in the Western Cape, U.S. and worldwide. In a recent preliminary study,
we showed that high dose maternal choline supplementation during pregnancy mitigates adverse effects of
PAE on infant growth and cognitive development, as well as neonatal brain structure. This proposal will add on
to a recently NIH-funded fully-powered, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which 288 heavy
drinking Western Cape women will be given choline or placebo during pregnancy and infants will be assessed
through 12 months of age. We propose the addition of neonatal neuroimaging, including brain anatomical,
diffusion and metabolic spectral imaging, to examine neural mechanisms mediating the beneficial effects of
maternal choline supplementation on infant developmental outcomes. We hypothesize that choline
supplementation in heavy drinking pregnant women will reduce the adverse impact of PAE on the developing
fetal brain by normalizing anatomical development, connectivity, and brain energy metabolism.
 Brain development is energy demanding and highly sensitive to nutritional reserves. Alcohol measurably
disrupts brain metabolites. Choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, a metabolite critical in healthy cell
development. Depletion of choline reserves coupled with alcohol-induced disruption adversely affects fetal
brain development. Our preliminary infant brain anatomical data show clear developmental effects of PAE and
the mitigating effects of maternal choline supplementation. We will combine the clinical and nutritional
information and infant cognitive test results from the clinical trial with the brain anatomical, connectivity and
metabolic measurements from the current study to augment our understanding of the mechanistic
underpinnings of the neuroprotective benefits of prenatal maternal choline supplementation on the developing
fetus in the setting of PAE.
 We will develop capacity for acquiring region-specific neurometabolic information using magnetic
resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and deep learning to identify neonatal brain regions. This project
builds on the decades-long collaborations between Drs. Meintjes (University of Cape Town), S. and J.
Jacobson (Wayne State University School of Medicine), van der Kouwe (Massachusetts General Hospital) and
Carter (Columbia University). Drs. Choi and Lee, experts on measuring energy metabolism in prescribed brain
regions using MRSI, will serve as consultants on this study."
10809662,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Oncolytic viruses (OV) are an emerging class of therapeutics capitalizing on their preferential ability to replicate in cancer
cells and modify the tumor microenvironment. Using Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) as an OV model, we were one of
the first groups to identify OV ability to induce tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and synergize with immune checkpoint
blockade. Based on this rationale, we have conducted a clinical trial of intraperitoneal (IP) ONCOS-102 (oncolytic
adenovirus) in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab in patients with advanced ovarian and
colorectal cancer (NCT02963831). Despite these studies, major gaps exist in our understanding of how OVs interact
with the immune system. While an increase in TILs or “making tumors hot” is commonly used as a readout of response
to OV, such readouts are highly nonspecific: (1) It is largely unknown whether the increase in TILs represents primarily
tumor-reactive or OV-reactive T cells; (2) It is unknown whether the OV-reactive T cells positively or negatively impact
anti-tumor immunity; (3) It is unknown how the balance between the tumor-reactive or OV-reactive T cells is influenced
by biologically distinct OVs. In our preliminary studies, we find that intratumoral NDV markedly expands the number of
T cell clones that are shared between the different tumor sites and that dominant T cell clones in the treated and distant
tumors are associated with distinct T cell phenotypes, thus possibly identifying tumor- vs. OV-reactive T cells. Using
immunologic and genetic tools such as T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and single cell RNA-sequencing and our
team’s expertise in computational biology, immunology and virology, the key objectives of our study are to define
the balance between the OV-reactive and tumor-reactive T cells generated in response to OV therapy and to
determine the impact of OV-reactive T cells on T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. In Aim 1, we will identify the
distinct TCR sequences and phenotypes associated with OV-reactive and tumor-reactive T cells and will quantify their
balance in the treated and distant tumors. We will determine how prior anti-OV immunity and OV-specific CD4 or CD8
T cells impact the anti-tumor T cell response and therapeutic efficacy. To ensure broad applicability of our findings, we
will test our hypothesis in two distinct mouse models: flank B16 melanoma and peritoneal model of ovarian carcinoma
MPB1 and will employ NDV (RNA virus) and vaccinia (DNA virus) as two biologically distinct virus models. In Aim 2, we
will leverage the tumor microenvironment data as well as TCR data from pre- and on-treatment tumors and blood from
our clinical trial of oncolytic adenovirus ONCOS-102 in combination with durvalumab to determine how putative OV-
and tumor-reactive T cells evolve in tumors and in peripheral blood and whether these parameters are predictive of
clinical benefit. This study will determine how different OVs activate anti-viral and anti-tumor adaptive immune response
and will enable us to understand the nature of OV-induced T cell responses beyond “hot vs. cold” within the context of
mouse and human studies. These findings will be key to understand the nature of immune responses to OVs in trials
and to enable future development of strategies aiming to enhance anti-tumor rather than anti-OV immunity."

The apical membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine play critical roles in physiology and homeostasis. Many
specialized functions of intestinal epithelial cells, such as nutrient absorption, depend on faithfully sorting proteins
to the apical membrane during biosynthetic delivery. However, the cellular mechanisms driving apical membrane
protein sorting and how it matures during development are poorly defined. Also unknown is what controls the
onset of apical endocytosis in Lysosome Rich Enterocytes (LREs). To discover mechanisms of apical membrane
polarization in vivo, we performed a forward genetics screen for factors required for sorting of a model apical
cargo (O-glycan-GFP, Og-GFP) in the zebrafish intestine. We isolated distinct classes of mutants affecting apical
Og-GFP sorting. Our preliminary data has uncovered a pH-dependent mechanism for sorting membrane proteins
in subapical endosomes either to the degradative pathway or to the apical membrane. We also discovered a role
for regulated pre-mRNA intron splicing in activating apical membrane transport pathways crucial for polarized
protein delivery in enterocytes and for apical endocytosis in LREs of the developing intestine. Our studies will
uncover genetic and cellular mechanisms crucial for the maturation of a fully polarized and physiologically active
epithelium in the vertebrate gut."

Society at large is facing a global “dementia epidemic” that is predicted to intensify with the growing aging
population. Although there is currently no cure for this devastating and pervasive condition, one life experience
shown to protect against the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) is that of bilingualism.
Nevertheless, findings regarding bilingualism as a contributor to cognitive reserve are mixed. These mixed
findings may, in part, be attributed to variability in the characterization of the bilingual experience across distinct
sociocultural contexts in addition to the presence of potential confounding variables. Little attention has been
directed towards examining bilingualism factors (e.g., language dominance, proficiency, use and age of
acquisition) that may underly these findings. In addition, limited attention has been directed towards language-
prominent dementia syndromes, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Although speech and language
impairments are ubiquitous features of ADRD, in the case PPA these debilitating deficits manifest as initial,
predominant symptoms. Differential patterns of language decline have been observed in bilingual PPA, with
resilience of the first learned language and parallel decline reported in the literature. However, a nuanced account
establishing patterns of language decline across different linguistic domains has yet to be systematically
examined in PPA. In addition, although positive effects of speech-language intervention are now well
documented in monolingual speakers with PPA, there is a significant gap in the literature examining treatment
optimized for bilingual speakers with PPA. Moreover, the behavioral, neural and bilingual factors associated with
language re-learning have yet to be established in bilingual speakers with PPA. The overall aim of the proposed
research is to establish associations between bilingualism factors and the onset, decline, and treatment response
of Hispanic, bilinguals (Spanish-Catalan) with PPA. In Aim 1, we seek to identify bilingualism factors associated
with a later age of onset in Hispanics with each PPA variant. In Aim 2, we seek to identify the bilingualism factors
associated with differential patterns of language impairment in Hispanics with PPA using metrics derived from
connected speech. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the benefits of tailored speech-language intervention in the largest
behavioral rehabilitation study of bilingual Hispanics with PPA to-date. We will also identify the bilingualism
factors, pre-treatment cognitive-linguistic measures, and brain regions implicated in bilingualism that predict the
magnitude of within-language gains and cross-language transfer effects. In order to accomplish these aims, we
will enroll 90 Hispanic, bilinguals with PPA who will undergo behavioral assessment, MRI, and speech-language
treatment. This proposal will provide needed evidence regarding cognitive reserve and linguistic resilience by
leveraging a large bilingual PPA cohort via an established international collaboration. Outcomes will also provide
crucial knowledge regarding neural mechanisms of language re-learning and will address how specific bilingual
factors influence cognitive reserve and linguistic resilience in language-prominent dementia."
10781974,"The primary aim of this pilot study is to characterize the relationships between prosthetic ankle-foot stiffness,
user reported comfort, and residuum-socket interface pressure in Veterans with transtibial amputation, and use
these relationships to guide prosthesis optimization to maximize daily comfort. User comfort is of paramount
importance to leg prosthesis users and has a direct impact on satisfaction with a prostheses, use or rejection of
a prosthesis, and ultimately mobility and independence. Nearly 90% of prosthetic clinical encounters in the US
are related to the lower limb, representing the vast majority of delivered prosthetic device interventions. However,
surveys suggest that between 33% and 57% of leg prosthesis users report dissatisfaction with comfort while
wearing their prosthesis, and 39% indicated that comfort and fit were their biggest concerns with a new prosthesis
and a primary reason for changing prosthetists. Moreover, 51% and 37% of Vietnam Veterans and OIF/OEF
Service Members reported prosthesis related pain. Importantly, regular use of a prosthesis and satisfaction with
its comfort can increase the likelihood of returning to work following lower limb loss and this is a critical factor to
Veterans’ community reintegration. Self-perceived comfort is a multifactorial, dynamic, psychophysical construct,
but evidence suggests it is influenced by residuum-socket interface pressures. These interface pressures are
affected by socket design, but also by prosthesis alignment given its influence on transfer of ground reaction
forces through the socket to proximal anatomy. By the same mechanism, prosthesis stiffness should also
theoretically affect interface pressures, but this relationship has not been quantified. To this end, prosthesis
properties could be tuned to manipulate interface pressures for maximizing comfort. Therefore, the Specific Aims
of this study are: 1) Define the maps connecting prosthetic foot stiffness, residuum-socket interface pressures,
and user-perceived comfort, and 2) Assess the efficacy of human-in-the-loop optimization to tune prosthetic foot
stiffness for minimizing interface pressure independent and in addition to the clinically optimized socket.
We will address the study aims through use of novel robotic prosthesis emulator platform that includes a high-
performance mechatronic system for rapid, controlled, and high-resolution keel stiffness modulations of a
tethered prosthetic ankle-foot end effector. Both aims will involve ten participants with unilateral transtibial
amputation. For Aim 1, participants will first undergo fitting and accommodation to the emulator system and
protocol, and then walk at steady state under different prosthesis ankle-foot stiffness settings stratified by a
certain percentage from a reference value specific to their body mass that reflects a common dynamic elastic
response foot. Peak interface pressures and socket comfort will be measured at each stiffness setting to quantify
associations between stiffness, comfort, and pressures as assessed through linear mixed modelling and curve
fitting. For Aim 2, participants will also undergo fitting and accommodation to the emulator system, and then
experience a process known as human-in-the-loop optimization in which the prosthesis keel stiffness will be
automatically optimized in real-time using Bayesian control algorithms focused on minimizing an interface
pressure cost function and maximizing comfort. In addition to continuous feedback on participant experience,
peak pressures, socket comfort, and perceived effort will be compared between the optimized stiffness setting
and the reference stiffness setting of Aim 1. [For both aims, lower extremity kinematics will be measured to
assess stiffness effects on gait performance.] Results from this study will inform on the clinically important
relationships between prosthesis stiffness, interface pressures, and comfort to guide prescription guidelines for
maximizing walking comfort in Veteran prosthesis users. Our results will also set the foundation for development
of a smart prosthesis through future Merit Awards that automatically implements stiffness adjustments according
to pressure biofeedback to maintain long-term Veteran daily comfort, prosthesis use, and independence."
10914776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the “big three” infectious diseases worldwide, malaria stands out for the complexity of the Plasmodium
life-cycle and biology. Malaria parasites breed mainly within red blood cells, and across their lifespan there are
dramatic shifts in protein expression and metabolism that alter their appearance, behavior, and susceptibility to
clearance by the host immune system or antimalarial drugs. Because it is an infection of the blood, a biopsy
can be taken with a simple finger prick, and the ability to derive histopathological information via light
microscopy is a critical tool in the study of, and ultimately control and treatment of, malaria. Manual review is
painstaking and imperfect. Neural network-based computer vision (CV) approaches can accelerate data
acquisition from light microscopy and innovate new methods of extracting data currently only possible through
costly, labor-intensive benchtop molecular methods or time-consuming review by a small number of malaria
microscopy experts with the necessary training and experience to distinguish subtle differences between
parasite forms.
 This R21 proposal builds on 12 months of preparatory work supported by a pilot grant from The Johns
Hopkins University Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science, a collaborative pursuit of the Schools
of Medicine and Engineering. The co-principal investigators developed a deep learning-based CV algorithm
trained on a public dataset of >10,000 images of Plasmodium falciparum ring stage parasites that can detect
and quantify parasites with >0.97 accuracy. However, significantly more information is ripe for extraction from
malaria smears beyond the simple detection of parasites. We built an early prototype of a 2nd-generation CV
algorithm capable of identifying the correct parasite stage to the level of early, middle or late ring stage with
>0.80 accuracy, and in this proposal we aim to refine the performance and extend the capabilities of the
malaria CV system to wider applications while pioneering new computational methods in multiple domain
adaptation and weakly- and semi-supervised learning.
 The proposed project would result in the development of a next-generation malaria CV system that can
derive molecular data from brightfield images for use by investigators at the bench or in the clinic. We will build
out the prototype CV system to optimize performance, develop higher-order classifiers (e.g., differentiating
viable from nonviable circulating parasites, finding once-infected cells for the prognosis of delayed hemolysis
after treatment), and run the algorithm against different tissue backgrounds (e.g., liver, spleen). The product of
this work will be a cutting-edge neural network-based malaria CV system that provides a multiplex readout of
parasite biological parameters and cellular pathology to help propel the fields of malaria research and
biomedical CV analysis forward."
10731386,"An existing mutual influence between testosterone (T) and glucose metabolism has been suggested by
studies showing that men with low T have impaired glucose tolerance, while a significant number of men with
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and obesity have low T. Thus, it is not surprising that as much as 64% of men with
T2D were found to have low T.
 Hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus (DM) each is associated with increased risk for fractures. While
hypogonadism is associated with increased bone turnover and bone loss. DM is associated with low bone
turnover and normal or high bone mineral density (BMD) but paradoxically a high risk for fractures. Our
preliminary data showed that compared to non-diabetic hypogonadal men, men with both conditions have
suppressed bone turnover, higher volumetric BMD (vBMD) and smaller bone size. As the effect of T on the male
skeleton is mainly mediated by its conversion to estradiol (E2) by the enzyme aromatase, the possibility of further
suppression of bone turnover with T therapy in these patients would be a concern. However, our initial data also
showed that T therapy in men with both conditions resulted in increased in markers of bone turnover and bone
size compared to the decrease in bone turnover and decrease in bone size in men with hypogonadism only,
suggesting activation in bone remodeling and improvement in bone geometry in the former. Furthermore, we
also found a trend for increase in bone strength (by finite element analysis or FEA) in the limited number of men
with both low T and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. These findings only suggest but do not prove
with certainty that T therapy would be beneficial to men with both low T and T2D. The central hypothesis of this
study is that T therapy will result in improvement in bone quality in patients who have both hypogonadism and
T2D. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the effect of T therapy on bone strength as
assessed by finite element analysis (µFEA) using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography
(HR-pQCT), 2) to determine the effect of T therapy on markers of bone turnover, and 3) an exploratory aim, to
evaluate the mechanism for improvement in bone quality from T therapy. We hypothesize that because T
stimulates osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation, the ensuing increase in osteoblast number will lead to an
enhanced cross-talk between osteoblast and osteoclast resulting in activation of bone remodeling and
replacement of old with new bone, hence, improvement in bone quality. In this study we will enroll 166 men with
T2D and hypogonadism and randomize them to either testosterone gel 1.62% or placebo for 12 months.
The following main outcomes will be evaluated: aim# 1) change in the primary endpoint which is µFEA, by
HRpQCT, #2) changes in C-telopeptide (CTX) a marker of bone resorption, and aim #3) changes in circulating
osteoblast progenitor (COP). We anticipate an increase in µFEA at the tibia and radius suggesting improvement
in bone strength, increase CTX and increase in circulating osteoblast progenitors. We further anticipate an
increase in other markers of bone turnover (both bone formation and resorption) and osteoclast precursors in
men with hypogonadism and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. Given the suppressed bone turnover
at baseline in men with low T and T2D, we hypothesize that the beneficial effect of T is its effect in activating
bone remodeling ultimately resulting in improvement in bone quality.
 Results from this study will provide information on the utility of T not only in improving quality of life but
also in improving bone quality in hypogonadal men with T2D. Given the relationship between glucose metabolism
and testosterone production, and the increasing number of male patients diagnosed with both hypogonadism
and T2D, this study will benefit not only the significant number of male veterans who have both conditions but
also men in general."
10812368,"Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a common cause for admission
within the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. It is associated with severe impairment of
physical and mental health status, and carries a high 5-yr mortality rate of ~75%. Even though
significant progress has been made in understanding its pathophysiology, currently, its
management and treatment is based on therapeutic targeting of a limited number of receptors
and pathways.
 Our team and others have made great progress in the last few years by understanding
and harnessing the Transient Potential Receptor superfamily as regulators of cardiovascular
function. Specifically, our laboratory has explored the role the vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) subtype plays
in regulating calcium handling and contractility. This work has led us to understand that TRPV2
modulates contractility via increasing calcium cycling in myocytes on a beat-to-beat basis.
 We have used probenecid, a generic, globally available drug with an extremely safe
profile that has been used for decades as a treatment for gout, as a TRPV2 agonist. Our work
with this drug has demonstrated it to be a potent inotrope without apoptotic, chronotropic or
arrhythmogenic effects in cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo murine and porcine models.
These findings have been taken to the bedside with a recently published small phase 2 study of
20 adult patients with HFrEF (the ReProsper HF pilot study) where we demonstrated a mean
improvement in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function with no adverse effects after only 1
week of treatment. The use of probenecid in HFrEF was also indirectly supported by a recent
retrospective study of approximately 40,000 patients in the Medicare database that found
treatment with probenecid (not specifically for heart disease) was associated with a 9% decreased
risk of HF hospitalization. These studies strongly argue for the safety and potential efficacy of
probenecid to improve systolic function and the need for a larger study, and of longer duration
that also evaluates functional and health status outcomes in addition to systolic function.
 The overall objective of this study is the treatment of outpatient veterans with NYHA II-III
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with probenecid to improve systolic and health
function. Specifically, we are proposing a three-site double-blinded, randomized, placebo-
controlled, three-site trial that will assess whether oral probenecid administered at 1 gr. orally
twice per day for 180 days in patients with NYHA II-III HFrEF improves systolic function as
measured via ejection fraction with echocardiography (aim 1); improves functional status as
measured by exercise stress testing (aim 2); and improves self-report heart failure specific health
status as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and overall health
status measured by EQ5D (aim 3).
 This trial is highly relevant to the VA population as HFrEF has been the number one reason
for admission among patients in the VA Health Care System and it is highly innovative as it will
seek to repurpose a previously established safe drug for a novel indication based on extensive
animal, preclinical and population based studies. If successful, this study will not only provide a
novel therapy it will also provide the necessary event rates for a future larger study to establish
its role in improving hospitalization and mortality."
10794348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 For transgender and nonbinary (TNB) people, anti-TNB stigma is a risk factor for adverse alcohol
outcomes, often co-occurring with depression and anxiety. Stigma’s impact on alcohol use and mental health is
of particular concern in TNB young adults (YA; 21-30 years old), who report more adverse alcohol and mental
health outcomes than older TNB adults. For these YA, favorable romantic relationship experiences may
attenuate the mental health impact of anti-TNB stigma, yet stigma may contribute to adverse relationship
experiences (e.g., intimate partner violence; IPV) linked to adverse alcohol and mental health outcomes.
Accordingly, relationship-focused interventions have the potential to improve alcohol and mental health
outcomes in TNB YA. However, targets for such interventions remain unclear—first, because the mechanisms
by which stigma affects relationship experiences have not been identified, and second, because it is not clear
what kinds of general or TNB-specific relationship experiences should be addressed. This project responds to
these gaps, culminating in development of a relationship-focused intervention for alcohol use and co-occurring
depression/anxiety in TNB YA. In Aim 1, I will collect survey data from 200 TNB YA in romantic relationships to
revise and validate a new measure of TNB-specific relationship experiences. In Aim 2, I will use the new
measure in a 2-month weekly diary study of stigma, relationship experiences, alcohol use, and
depression/anxiety (n=250 TNB YA in romantic relationships). I will use these data to (1) assess weekly
associations of stigma and relationship experiences with alcohol use and depression/anxiety, and (2) identify
mechanisms by which stigma may affect relationship experiences. In Aim 3, I will adapt an existing type of
online alcohol intervention—technology-adapted motivational interviewing with personalized feedback—by
tailoring content for TNB YA and (if supported by Aim 2 findings) adding components to address relationship
experiences in the context of anti-TNB stigma. The intervention, Whole Selves, will be developed through a
multi-phase co-design process with 8 TNB YA, followed by evaluation of acceptability, usability, and
engagement in user-testing interviews (n=5 TNB YA in romantic relationships) and a single-arm feasibility
study (n=107 TNB YA in romantic relationships). In the K99 phase, this work will be coordinated with training in
psychometrics/scale development, diary methods, and community-engaged intervention development, with
mentorship from senior scholars known for applying these methods to research on stigma, alcohol use, mental
health, and romantic relationships. This training and mentorship will prepare me to develop and evaluate
Whole Selves in the R00 phase, producing preliminary data for an R01 efficacy trial proposal. Thus, the project
and associated training will allow me to launch an independent research career with the goals of (1) identifying
the mechanisms by which stigma affects young people’s alcohol use and mental health, and (2) partnering with
affected communities to mitigate these effects through scalable interventions."
10828821,"Sepsis results in 75,000 pediatric and one million adult hospital admissions per year,
costing $20 billion dollars and 200,000 lives in the US annually. Risk for severe infection has a
heritable component, and offspring of parents who suffer early death from infection have a 6-fold
increased risk of infectious death even when adopted into other households. However, the
specific sites of genetic variation that convey this are poorly understood. Here, I propose to use
whole exome sequencing to identify septic individuals with shared genetic risk for heritable
thrombotic microangiopathy and immune dysregulation, and determine if these genotypes
associate with clinical, cytokine and organ injury patterns typical of these thrombotic
microangiopathy and hyperinflammatory disorders during severe sepsis, phenotypes that have
been associated with poor outcome. My overall objective in this career development award
is to identify genotypes that confer risk for development of thrombotic microangiopathy
and immune dysregulation in severe sepsis, and validate these findings in multiple sepsis
cohorts. My central hypothesis is that immunologically active variants that cause primary
immunologic disorders characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy and hyperinflammation will
be linked to the development of related phenotypes and organ failure patterns in severe sepsis. I
will test my central hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) Confirm the link between thrombotic
microangiopathy-related variants and complement hyperactivation in severe sepsis by direct
measurement of complement activation products and archetypal organ injury biomarkers, 2)
Explore the relationships between immune dysregulation genotype and clinical, immunologic and
organ injury patterns typical for cytotoxic defects and dysfunctional macrophage and T-cell
interaction and 3) externally validate our previous IEI genotype-phenotype associations in novel
cohorts. This approach may allow for identification of specific genetic risk variants, as well as
outcome-associated disease mechanisms as targets for further study in severe sepsis. Closely
mentored by experts in pediatric sepsis, immune dysregulation, genomic medicine, bioinformatics
and data science, this award will provide essential training in coding, genetic epidemiology,
statistical assessment of genomic data, and prospective clinical trials. As the foundation for a
career, this project will hone my skills in genomic research design and analysis necessary to study
precision approaches to pediatric critical care."

 Dr. Chanee Fabius is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at
the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her career goal is to become an independent
investigator conducting high-impact embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) directed at testing
interventions, policies and programs in real world settings to better support the home care workforce and
improve care quality and quality of life among those receiving services, including persons living with
Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their family caregivers. This award will provide her
with the protected time and learning experiences to obtain the knowledge, skills, and capability to develop
ePCTs and translate findings into routine home care delivery. Dr. Fabius’s career development award
proposes five years of training in mixed methods, human factors approaches in home care research, and
applied experiences developing and conducting ePCTs. Dr. Fabius has assembled a stellar mentorship team
and advisory panel with expertise in the areas of her proposed training goals.
 As a result of disease progression, high care needs, and limited financial resources, persons living with
ADRD often receive Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services, delivered by home care aides proving
hands on assistance with daily activities. Family caregivers and home care aides interact to provide care for
older adults, but their relationship is often fraught due to gaps in information, misalignment of role expectations,
and lack of shared understanding of each other’s roles in home care. The proposed K01 will: (1) leverage
nationally representative data to determine how role sharing between family caregivers and home care aides
differs among Medicare-Medicaid enrolled home care recipients with and without ADRD, and is associated with
older adults’ participation restrictions; (2) conduct a qualitative study to develop and refine a home care role
and preference guide to improve information sharing and clarify role expectations between family caregivers
and home care aides caring for older Medicaid HCBS recipients living with ADRD; (3) assess the feasibility and
acceptability of delivering a home care role and preference guide to family caregivers of older adults living with
ADRD and home care aides. The intervention will be piloted in up to five agencies within 10 triads of older
adults living with ADRD, family caregivers, and home care aides. The proposed work is aligned with recent
policy and research recommendations calling for interventions that support quality of life for older adults living
with ADRD, family caregivers, and home care aides. Findings will support the development and submission of
an R01 grant proposal to implement and test an ePCT in Medicaid HCBS to assess the effects of the role and
preference guide and quality of life outcomes for older adults, family caregivers, and home care aides."
10758267,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, affect 1 in 200
Americans. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha therapies remain the cornerstone of therapy for patients
with IBD, but approximately 40% of patients will experience primary or secondary loss of response, and “anti-
TNF-experienced” patients are less likely to respond to all subsequent therapies in current clinical practice.
Single-cell RNA sequencing has uncovered key cellular signatures associated with anti-TNF refractoriness that
strongly implicate signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated fibroblasts. There remains a
major gap in our understanding of the patient-specific factors that predispose to this aberrant macrophage-
fibroblast activation, how it links to anti-TNF unresponsiveness, and the potential to modulate it to change to
disease course and treatment response. Our work has focused on the functional implications of a pathogenic
variant in a metal transporter, ZIP8 A391T, that dysregulates manganese homeostasis and is associated with
complicated (stricturing and penetrating) Crohn’s disease. In studying ZIP8 391-Thr in a mouse model (Zip8
393T-knock-in (KI)), we have shown increased susceptibility to colitis, but even more interestingly, we have
observed enhanced fibrosis. These mice also exhibit marked induction of Il-11, a pro-inflammatory and pro-
fibrotic cytokine that is a hallmark of aberrant signaling between inflammatory macrophages and activated
fibroblasts in patients with Crohn’s disease – particularly anti-TNF refractory disease. We therefore
hypothesize that study of aberrant macrophage-fibroblast signaling is a key feature of disease pathogenesis in
the Zip8 393T-KI mice. Establishing the underlying disease mechanisms are important because (1) up to 25%
of patients with Crohn’s disease carry ZIP8 391-Thr in some populations and (2) the Zip8 393T-KI could serve
as a novel translational model for mechanistic studies, particularly related to anti-TNF non-response. We will
study this hypothesis in two aims: In Aim 1, we will determine if Zip8 393T-KI perturbs macrophage innate
immune responses; in Aim 2, we will compare fibroblast activation induced by Zip8 393T-KI vs. WT Zip8
macrophages. The long-term goal is to establish if ZIP8 391-Thr genotype has clinical implications for the
prevention of and treatment of patients with Crohn’s disease and use study of ZIP8 391-Thr-related pathology
as key opportunity to elucidate the role of Mn homeostasis in human disease. This R03 application builds from
a K08 that established the altered Mn homeostasis and fibroinflammatory phenotype in colitis in Zip8 393T-KI
mice. This application with strong translational relevance will provide critical mechanistic insight of the ZIP8
genotypic effect on macrophage-fibroblast signaling and the interaction with Mn homeostasis to prioritize
therapeutic targets, including STAT3 or IL-11 inhibition, and patient studies as part of an R01 application."
10758610,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project focuses on the mechanisms by which IL-10 differentially regulates and promotes
mast cell (MC) hyperplasia, heterogeneity, activation and cellular functions during the
development of IgE and non-IgE-mediated allergic responses to food antigens.
We have demonstrated a key role for the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 in driving MC
expansion, activation, and cytokine production during food allergy. IL-10-primed MCs exhibited
enhanced proliferation, IgE-mediated passive anaphylaxis, and the production of TH2-type
cytokines. This suggests a novel role for IL-10 in the homeostasis and function of MCs. However,
the mechanisms by which IL-10 promotes MC activation are not very clear and remain to be
determined. Furthermore, whether these proinflammatory effects of IL-10 on MCs extend to
specific MC lineages, are global in nature, or context-dependent also remain to be examined. This
project combines hypothesis testing and targeted mechanistic approaches to further probe the
mechanisms by which IL-10 regulates MC functions. These include understanding whether IL-10
differentially regulates MC responses to distinct antigenic stimuli, assessment of its effects on
heterogeneous MC subsets, and determination of whether its effects are controlled by the source
cell type. The long-term overall goals are to: 1) identify cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors by
which IL-10 promotes or suppresses distinct MC populations and regulates their effector function
during type 2 inflammatory responses; and 2) examine the systemic and functional local tissue
consequences of regulation of MC expansion and activation by IL-10. Aim 1 will elucidate whether
IL-10 promotes IgE-mediated mucosal MC responses to physiological food antigens such as
peanut and egg allergen and examine its effects on non-IgE-mediated pathways of allergic
sensitization including IL-33-induced anaphylaxis. Whether the effects of IL-10 also extend to
connective tissue MCs will be assessed and the phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles of both
MC subsets will be mapped. Aim 2 will assess the contributions of cell-intrinsic and paracrine IL-
10 to MC hyperplasia and effector function. Aim 3 will identify the effects of source-dependent IL-
10 and determine whether TH2 or non-TH2-derived IL-10 can differentially regulate MC function.
Given the known pleiotropic pathologic and regulatory effects of IL-10 during various T and MC-
mediated immune responses including anti-parasitic responses and allergy, and considering its
status as a canonical immunoregulatory cytokine, it is important to further identify the mechanisms
underlying the proinflammatory effects of IL-10 and its ability to promote rather than suppress
MC-dependent responses. As such, these studies are not only relevant to the mission of NIAID
but may also serve to identify precision-based approaches for therapeutic interventions."
10809660,"Project Summary/Abstract
By 2050, two-thirds of older individuals with dementia will live in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). As
LMICs continue to experience a reduction in mortality, it is critical to determine factors that confer protection and
resilience toward Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Some studies find that bilinguals are at
reduced ADRD risk compared to monolinguals, but other studies do not find evidence of a bilingual advantage.
The rationale for this study is that the equivocal findings of prior research has been driven largely by
methodological inconsistencies that limit our understanding of bilingualism’s role in cognitive aging such as: 1)
inadequate control for potential confounders that limit our ability to infer whether bilingualism has a direct effect
on cognition or whether these relationships are due to environmental and sociocultural factors, 2) limited
inclusion of markers of neuropathology, and 3) little attention given to within-group differences among bilinguals,
such as age of second language (L2) acquisition, proficiency, frequency of language use, number of languages
spoken, and diversity of language families. India offers a unique opportunity to study the role of bilingualism in
cognitive reserve and resilience, given its rich linguistic and sociocultural diversity across the country. The overall
aim of the study is to leverage the unique features of India’s linguistic and sociodemographic landscape to
discern whether bilingualism modifies the association between blood-based and neuroimaging biomarkers of
ADRD and cognition and cognitive decline. This study will analyze available plasma-based measures of amyloid
and tau pathologies, MRI, and cognitive assessments from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India–Diagnostic
Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD), a large, population-representative study of ageing and dementia in India.
Specifically, the project will 1) determine whether bilingualism modifies the association between ADRD
biomarkers (blood-based or neuroimaging) and cognitive outcomes, 2) evaluate whether the protective effect of
bilingualism differs across diverse life-course environmental determinants of health, and 3) deconstruct language
use within bilinguals in India to understand the mechanisms by which bilingualism confers cognitive reserve
against biological risk of ADRD. We hypothesize that bilingualism will buffer the effects of blood AD-biomarkers
(amyloid, and tau plasma levels), cortical atrophy, and white matter integrity on baseline cognition and rate of
cognitive decline compared to monolinguals in the domains of memory, language, and executive functioning. In
addition, by deconstructing bilingualism, we hypothesize that earlier age of L2 acquisition, higher bilingual
proficiency, greater daily multiple language use, higher number of languages acquired, and greater distance
between language families will confer cognitive reserve, independent of confounding sociocultural factors (i.e.,
education, socioeconomic status). This proposal will enhance the field of ADRD by uncovering the underlying
mechanisms of resilience to ADRD that may be modifiable and transferable to other populations."
10808059,"ABSTRACT
Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have established the debilitating neurocognitive side
effects of various chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of cancer, often referred as
chemobrain. With substantial increases in the number of cancer survivors, over 16.9 million in the
U.S. alone, cognitive function following cancer treatment is considered as one of the most critical
criterion for evaluating therapeutic outcome and for determining long-term quality of life. The
situation is confounded further by the conspicuous absence of satisfactory treatments for reducing
the progressive neurocognitive sequelae associated with non-CNS cancer therapies. This
application is in response to a specific RFA (PAR-21-329) to investigate interventions designed
to prevent or reduce the adverse neurocognitive sequelae following cancer therapy. Our pre-
clinical studies have shown long-term consequences of chronic chemotherapy
(cyclophosphamide, CYP; Adriamycin, ADR monotherapy) including cognitive impairments, loss
of neuronal architecture, spine integrity and neuroinflammation. We posit that neuroinflammation
is one of the major contributory factors for long-term CNS dysfunction and that human neural
stem cell (hNSC)-derived extracellular vesicle (EVs) treatment can ameliorate adverse
neurocognitive and inflammatory sequelae associated with chemobrain. Our recent data show
that hNSCs or hNSC-derived EV reverse cancer therapy (CYP or irradiation, IRR)-induced
cognitive impairments, neuron and spine damage and, neuroinflammation. Intra-venous (retro-
orbital vein, RO) injections of hNSC-EVs showed long-term neuroprotection in the IRR brain. We
have also identified candidate miRNA within the EV cargo, with gene targets relevant to the
molecular, structural and behavioral improvements observed in the cancer therapy-exposed
animals following EV injection. Importantly, in vivo expression of miR-124-3p reversed IRR-
induced cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation. Based on the foregoing, we propose a
comprehensive series of studies designed to test the effectiveness hNSC-EV and determine an
EV-derived candidate miRNA-based mechanism to ameliorate chemobrain and
neuroinflammation in routinely used adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (Carboplatin-Taxol, ADR-
CYP) to control the growth of ovarian and breast cancer. Our research design will delineate long-
term neuroprotective effects of RO injections of hSNC-EV or in vivo expression of miR-124-3p
following adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in disease-free or xenograft cancer mouse models.
These studies will also elucidate the safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of hNSC-EVs therapy
in the context of cancer. Thus, this project is based on a foundation of strong published and
preliminary data supporting our rationale."
10798336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genetically-encoded technologies that enable the design of systems that receive, process, and
transmit molecular information are essential to advancing basic biological research, applied
biomedical research, and biotechnology. RNA switches are a class of ligand-responsive genetic
controllers that are being implemented in diverse biological systems to transform our ability to
monitor, interface with, and program the dynamic cellular state. While the application of synthetic
regulatory RNAs has grown remarkably over the past decade, current approaches to the design of
new RNA regulatory elements are inefficient, laborious, and typically do not yield insight into the
sequence-structure-function relationships underlying the activities of these molecules in complex
biological systems.
 The goal of the proposed project is to develop new strategies for approaching the design,
measurement, and analysis of an important class of RNA switches that incorporate ribozymes as the
gene-control element. The goal of the project will be achieved through three specific aims. The first
specific aim will focus on developing and validating a multiplexed, automated evolution pipeline to
enable the scalable discovery and characterization of new RNA switches. The second specific aim
will focus on developing new quantitative methods to examine the secondary structures and tertiary
interactions that are key to the activity of RNA switches. The third specific aim will apply the new
evolution pipeline and analysis methods to generate new RNA switches and probe the diversity of
mechanisms underlying the function of engineered switches.
 The successful execution of the project will transform our capacity to rapidly and reliably build
these genetic tools for diverse biological systems. In addition, the rich datasets generated through the
newly developed methods will be leveraged to uncover new insight into the sequence-activity
landscapes underlying this important class of functional RNA molecules and answer long-standing
questions in the field. These insights will more broadly advance our understanding of RNA sequence-
structure-function relationships and ultimately dramatically improve our capacities to design functional
RNA molecules tailored to biomedical applications. The pipelines and approaches developed through
this project will change the paradigm by which the research community approaches functional RNA
design, thereby having a substantially broader impact on the field."

During the previous funding period, we generated a conditional mouse model of the recurrent sodium channel
mutation SCN8A-p.R1872W that is responsible for the rare, devastating disorder Developmental Epileptic
Encephalopathy (DEE). We demonstrated that expression of the mutant channel in excitatory neurons of the
forebrain reproduces the seizures and sudden death of the human disorder. We also developed an effective
treatment for Scn8a-DEE by intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that
reduced both mutant and wildtype transcript level throughout the brain, resulting in delayed seizure onset and
extended lifespan. We will build on this important preclinical result by developing improved, longeracting
treatments that will minimize the side effects of excess Scn8a reduction. First, AAV viral delivery of an Scn8a-
shRNA will limit effects to specific brain regions only. Second, the multiple nucleotide substitutions in our
engineered Scn8a-N1768D mutant make it feasible to specifically inactivate the mutant allele by CRISPR/Cas
targeting. The goal of these experiments is to minimize the potential side effects of Scn8a deficiency and to
avoid the repeated treatments required for ASO therapy. Finally, expression of Scn8aR1872W in cerebellar
Purkinje cells results in elevated neuronal excitability. We will characterize mice with specific expression of the
mutant allele in Purkinje cells to gain insight into the role of the cerebellum in the movement and cognitive co-
morbidities that accompany SCN8A-DEE. The work described here will extend basic understanding of SCN8A
pathophysiology and provide pre-clinical evidence regarding future translational potential of regional or mutant-
allele-specific down-regulation of pathogenic variants of SCN8A."
10744227,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will study midlife mortality trends by analyzing the local correlates and risk factors of cause of
death in their place-based context between 1990 and 2021. Using cause-specific death data, sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, and economic trends, the research will generate trajectories of midlife mortality risks for
dynamically-derived spatial units. What makes this project innovative and significant is (1) mortality data at the
block, zip code or tract level; (2) methods in spatial analysis, time series trajectory determination, and mul-
tiscalar statistical analysis; and (3) an innovative and integrated approach to policy research, conducted by a
team experienced in demographic analysis, multiscalar spatial and temporal statistics, and rural health policy
formulation. This work responds to research and policy discussions regarding potentially-modifiable attributes
of places related to rising mortality among middle-aged adults. Several cause-specific mortality trends warrant
attention: rising rates of suicides, cardiometabolic diseases, and deaths due to drug or alcohol abuse, along
with their interactions with select infectious diseases (e.g., Hepatitis C and COVID-19). The project has five
specific aims: (1) For select U.S. states where block- or tract-level mortality data are available, researchers will
create a novel micro-scale database with cause-specific mortality records and contextual data including cen-
sus-based demographic data, employment and business data, property characteristics, and crime data. (2)
The research makes use of an iterative algorithm to identify clusters of micro-units that have common, cause-
specific mortality patterns, using community detection methods, in order to identify the most salient levels of
spatial units at which processes affecting midlife mortality occur. It also assesses spatial autocorrelation to
identify mortality hot- and cold-spots (spatial) and undertakes extreme event detection to identify hot-moments
(temporal). (3) The project uses multi-channel sequencing to classify geographic units, for example, where
population has grown or diminished, aged, or seen an increase in children, or where the economy has created
wealth. These trajectories constitute a set of place-based classifications for later analysis. (4) The project’s
analysis will use spatiotemporal models to estimate the effect of local-to-regional determinants of cause-spe-
cific mortality in middle-aged adults, with two strategies: (A) Assess the role of different place-based determi-
nants of midlife mortality, in order to evaluate theories of midlife mortality differentials and to test specific hy-
potheses (e.g., economic distress). (B) Identify the optimal scale at which determinants with the greatest im-
pact operate to inform policy recommendations designed to target midlife mortality for specific causes of death.
(5) Designing policy interventions is fundamental to the project, which begins with a policy mapping process,
and builds on the results of the multiscalar analysis to design intervention strategies targeting the determinants
of mortality differentials and the characteristics of places at greatest risk of continued mortality challenges."
10930925,"Abstract/Summary
Proton arc therapy has lagged behind photon arc therapy, which is now commonplace in the clinic, due mostly
to slow proton energy switching times which make treatment durations impractical. Fast energy modulation
systems are now clinically available, and, by applying delivery optimization tools that intelligently change beam
energy as the gantry rotates, proton arc therapy is on the verge of becoming a clinical reality that can improve
plan delivery speed and robustness to range uncertainties relative to conventional fixed field proton therapy.
Without dynamic lateral beam collimation, however, proton arc therapy tumor dose conformity will be inferior to
fixed field collimated proton therapy plans. This is a major problem especially for brain and head and neck
cancer patients whose normal tissues could be spared significant radiation dose using beam collimation. The
long-term goal is to develop the next generation of pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy delivery
systems that maximize the achievable tumor dose conformity, robustness, and delivery speed. The overall
objective of this proposal is to develop dynamically collimated arc-based PBS by expanding the dynamic
collimation system (DCS) technology developed in the first part of this R37 proposal, providing the capability
for rapid, tumor-conformal delivery of dose distributions that are more robust to uncertainties in Bragg Peak
position placement than those delivered with fixed field proton therapy. The rationale for this project is that
superior treatment plans will result from the combination of energy-specific collimation and rotational arc
delivery than either of the individual technologies, thus improving the quality of care of proton therapy. Guided
by strong preliminary data from our in-silico treatment planning studies and constructed DCS prototype,
development of collimated proton arc therapy will be carried out by pursuing three specific aims: 1) develop
arc-based treatment planning and delivery methods for dynamically collimated proton therapy, 2) enhance the
clinical DCS prototype to perform proton arc treatments, and 3) adapt existing treatment verification
methodologies for quality assurance. Under specific aim 1, established multi-field treatment planning
techniques, both dose calculation and optimization, will be extended to include the optimization of trimmer and
energy sequencing for the case of a rotating gantry. Under specific aim 2, real-time feedback mechanisms will
be incorporated to monitor and synchronize gantry angle to the sequencing of the high-speed trimmer blades.
Under specific aim 3, experimental and computational techniques will be developed and demonstrated to
enable successful commissioning of dynamic collimated proton arc therapy. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because it represents a new combination of two promising and synergistic
technologies: dynamic collimation and proton arc therapy. This contribution is expected to be significant since
the two technologies together can preserve conformity improvements gained by collimated PBS while adding
the robustness and delivery speed benefits achievable with arc therapy, improving treatment outcomes."
10856907,"The goal of this proposal is to provide in vivo proof-of-concept for the use of the blood cancer drug
asparaginase (ASNase) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who possess the biomarkers for response
to this novel biologic. ASNases have a unique mode of action wherein the drug depletes the amino acid
asparagine from the blood, and, as a result, cells that rely on blood asparagine are starved and ultimately
killed. The current FDA-approved ASNases are of bacterial origin, which makes them immunogenic, and their
toxicity-causing glutaminase (GLNase) side activity causes severe drug side effects, which are exacerbated in
adults. Therefore, despite the immense potential of ASNases for the treatment of several cancer types, these
drugs are predominately confined to the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To make
ASNase therapy an option for adult patients with cancers that depend on blood asparagine, we engineered a
human-like ASNase that mitigates the immune response and is highly specific to eliminate the GLNase-related
toxicity. Notably, toxicity studies comparing our engineered human-like ASNase to the current standard-of-care
bacterial ASNase (Oncaspar) demonstrated the significantly improved safety of our ASNase. Importantly, the
improved safety comes with equivalent efficacy for ALL. Together, these developments make it possible to
expand ASNase therapy to solid tumors in adult cancer patients. Response to ASNase is dependent on no/low
expression of the enzyme that synthesizes asparagine de novo, called asparagine synthetase (ASNS).
However, a durable response requires the inability of the cancer cell to upregulate ASNS expression in
response to asparagine depletion. The ability to upregulate ASNS expression is determined by the methylation
state of the ASNS promoter, where hypermethylation prevents expression and hypomethylation allows for
expression. Recent analysis of cancer cell lines and patient samples reveal that many HCC patients possess
either the full ASNase-response signature (low ASNS levels, hypermethylated promoter) or partial ASNase-
response signature (low ASNS levels, hypomethylated promoter). Tumor cells with the full signature are
predicted to strongly respond to ASNase alone, and those with the partial signature are predicted to have a
less durable response. In preliminary work, we verified the predictive power of the full and partial ASNase
response signatures on several HCC cell lines. To increase the clinical relevance of this observation, in Aim 1
we will collect HCC tumor samples from Veterans (treated at JBVAMC) and from a predominantly minority
population (treated at UIC) and determine the predisposition of these patients to possess the ASNase-
sensitivity biomarkers. These patient samples will also be used to generate HCC primary cell line, organoid,
and PDX models. In Aim 2, using both in vitro and in vivo studies, we will determine the factor(s) that make
HCC cell lines sensitive or resistant to ASNase therapy. Aim 3 will expand the in vivo studies to the patient-
derived cell lines, organoids and PDXs generated in Aim 1, and evaluate our ability to predict which patients
will respond to ASNase therapy. Success in these studies will supply the proof-of-concept for using our new,
safer ASNase in HCC. Moreover, by utilizing mechanistically based biomarkers we would be able to identify
those patients that would respond to ASNase. Success will also provide the impetus for testing this novel
approach in other cancers, using the biomarkers validated by these studies for patient selection."

Background: Increased arterial stiffness has been associated with indicators of damage to the brain including
presence of white matter hyperintensity, infarctions, and brain atrophy as assessed with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). When vessels lose their ability to mechanically absorb the effects of pulsatile flow, that
pulsatility is transmitted to the vasculature in the brain leading to deleterious changes in the brain tissue.
Understanding the effect of ultrasound measured viscoelastic mechanical properties of central conduit (e.g.,
carotid) arteries relative to MRI measured brain health indicators could result in a very important tool for
predicting and managing changes in brain function. This research project aims to address these unmet and
critical needs to develop techniques for the accurate and translatable ultrasound measurement of
viscoelastic arterial mechanical properties and evaluate associations with structural changes in the brain.
Methods: Ultrasound is a first-line imaging modality for vascular evaluation, but most clinical scanners do not
have the ability to evaluate the elastic or viscoelastic mechanical properties of vessels in an accurate,
quantitative manner with high temporal resolution. In the first cycle of this grant, we developed an ultrasound-
based method called arterial dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (ADUV) that utilizes acoustic radiation force to
stimulate high-frequency (200-1500 Hz) waves in the arterial wall, followed by high frame rate ultrasound to
measure the wave motion, which is used to characterize arterial viscoelastic mechanical properties.
However, our research revealed that several aspects of ADUV could be further improved before being used on
a daily basis in the clinic. Among these improvements are increasing the wave motion signal-to-noise ratio,
making precise measurements of the vessel geometry with ultrasound, and improving our inversion and
classification frameworks. With these improved ADUV methods, we will evaluate how the viscoelastic
properties of the carotid artery are associated with the health of the brain as judged using MRI brain
morphology data. With the strong collaborative team including expertise in cardiovascular medicine, radiology,
ultrasound engineering, waveguide modeling, inverse problems, data reduction and classification, we will bring
ADUV closer to widespread translation with the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1) Optimize ADUV to enhance motion measurement quality for more accurate and precise
 mechanical property estimation.
Aim 2) Develop advanced mathematical models for estimation of arterial mechanical properties and
 classification of disease state.
Aim 3) Correlate ADUV measurements of carotid artery viscoelasticity with MRI indicators of brain
 health in patients."

Background: Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, involves the axillary lymph nodes in 25-30%
of cases. Treatment usually involves systemic therapy before surgery. Complete response to neoadjuvant
systemic therapy (NST) with normalization of the lymph nodes translates to less extensive surgery, lower related
morbidity, and sometimes less intense radiation therapy. To mark a positive lymph node, a biopsy marker is
placed in the positive node pre-NST. Post-NST, the marked node is identified with ultrasound, mammography,
or computed tomography to implant a localizer, which the surgeon uses for node removal. Ultrasound is the first-
line imaging modality for this task. Still, the marker cannot be found sonographically in ~25% of cases, resulting
in suboptimal or aborted localizations, delays to surgery, longer procedural times, increased patient discomfort
or inconvenience, and increased absorbed costs by the clinical practice. Errors in identifying the proper node(s)
may lead to false-negative results, over/undertreatment, and potential cancer recurrence. Marker migration
remains another concern that can lead to misguided localization, directing the surgeon to the incorrect node.
This research project aims to address these unmet and critical needs to develop reliable, readily
ultrasound-conspicuous markers that are also resistant to migration.
Methods: Our preliminary data suggest that physical features of markers, like surface roughness, can cause an
ultrasound twinkling artifact or “twinkling signature” classically associated with kidney stones using color Doppler
flow imaging. With the collective expertise of a diverse research team, we have developed markers using
polymethyl methacrylate and additive manufacturing (three-dimensional printing). These markers generate
robust twinkling signatures with ultrasound, are visible with multiple imaging modalities, and are resistant to
marker migration. We will test the efficacy and safety of these markers in a porcine model over a six-month
period to mimic the duration of NST treatment with chemotherapy. Lastly, we will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial
in breast cancer patients with our optimized marker to evaluate the long-term strength of the twinkling signature
and the degree of marker migration. To accomplish the goals of this project, we propose these Specific Aims:
Aim 1 Optimize ultrasound acquisition characteristics and the signal processing chain to robustly detect twinkling.
Aim 2 Optimize physical characteristics of breast procedure markers that enhance Doppler-based twinkling and
 reduce marker migration.
Aim 3 Assess long-term safety, twinkling persistence, and marker migration of candidate markers in a porcine
 animal model.
Aim 4 Evaluate twinkling and migration of optimized markers in a Phase 1 clinical trial using markers implanted
 in a positive axillary lymph node prior to NST in patients with breast cancer."
10757931,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding circuit-level maneuvers that affect brain plasticity will inform the design of targeted interventions
after stroke. Experiments outlined in this proposal will determine the contributions of excitatory/inhibitory circuits
on brain repair processes after focal ischemia, and how changes in behavioral performance relate to cell-specific
changes in connectivity. Stroke causes direct structural damage to local brain circuitry and indirect disruption of
global networks resulting in behavioral deficits spanning multiple domains. Stroke recovery is associated with
functional brain reorganization, a process involving the formation of new or alternative circuits. Along with
behavioral recovery, damaged regions remap to adjacent tissue while patterns of resting-state functional
connectivity (RS-FC) within and across resting-state networks gradually renormalize. While local and global
changes in functional brain organization are consistently observed during recovery, how these processes relate
to the underlying neuronal circuitry supporting recovery of function is unknown. This knowledge gap exists
partially because stimulus-evoked and resting-state patterns reflect ensemble activity from many cell types, and
patterns of RS-FC can be orchestrated through indirect pathways. Understanding how disconnected inhibitory
and excitatory circuits reintegrate into global networks to support recovery requires examination of neural
network connectivity structure as it evolves with neuroanatomical markers of circuit repair. While an integrated
mechanism relating cellular plasticity with network plasticity has yet to be established, inhibitory circuits have
been shown to play a key role. Stroke disrupts the brain’s balance of excitation and inhibition. Restoring this
balance through non-invasive brain stimulation techniques can improve recovery. However, treatment efficacy
using these methods is extremely varied, partially due to the imprecision and indiscriminate activation or
inhibition of all cells near the stimulated site. Parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) are the most prevalent of all
GABAergic interneurons, play key roles in shaping excitability over long distances, and regulate functional brain
rhythms reflected in coherent patterns of RS-FC. Though their role in post-stroke plasticity is unknown, PV-INs
are known to mediate several other forms of activity-dependent plasticity, making them compelling candidates
for affecting repair processes after stroke. Using optogenetic targeting and wide field optical imaging of cortical
calcium dynamics in awake mice, we will establish functional connectomes of excitatory (CamK2a-based) and
inhibitory (PV-based) circuits and how they evolve following focal ischemia (Aim 1). We will utilize the well-
characterized motor-barrel network in the mouse to directly test the influence of activity in cortical
excitatory/inhibitory nodes exhibiting strong (Aim 2) or weak (Aim 3) inter- or intra-hemispheric connectivity with
perilesional tissue, and how these manipulations affect neuroanatomical markers of circuit repair. At the
conclusion of this grant, we will determine the contributions of CamK2a/PV circuits on post-stroke recovery, and
further understand the components of connectivity restoration required for more complete behavioral recovery."
10771311,"Approximately 30% of children will experience an anxiety disorder, making anxiety the most common
mental health problem among children in the United States. However, few children receive treatment and
even our most effective anxiety treatments leave up to half of children in need of additional intervention.
Despite the well-established role of parent anxiety in transmitting and maintaining child anxiety, the lack of
data on specific parent mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of anxiety is a critical
barrier to informing novel targets of personalized treatments. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Plan,
Objective 2.2 to understand risk factors and behavioral indicators of mental illness across the lifespan and
to identify novel intervention targets based on knowledge of psychological mechanisms, the current
proposal focuses on interpretation bias, the tendency to perceive threat in ambiguous situations. The
overall objective of this project is to empirically test a theoretical model of the intergenerational
transmission of anxiety focused on parent interpretation bias as a root cause. Our specific aims are to test
theorized effects of parent interpretation bias on (1) parent behavior and (2) child interpretation bias and
(3) evaluate potential moderators to refine theories of intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform
future personalized interventions. Our central hypothesis is that parent interpretation bias influences child
interpretation bias through its effects on maladaptive, anxiety-promoting parenting behaviors, such as
accommodation and modeling of avoidant coping. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize 300 parents
of children ages 7-12 to complete four weeks of a smartphone delivered interpretation bias manipulation
vs. a self-assessment smartphone app condition. The interpretation bias intervention teaches parents to
interpret ambiguous situations in a non-threatening manner via quick, repeated practice and corrective
feedback. Before and after completing their randomly assigned condition, parent-child dyads will complete
self-report and behavioral tasks designed to elicit anxiety-promoting behaviors from parents depending
upon their interpretation of the ambiguous situation (speech and puzzle tasks). Parents will also complete
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) of parenting behaviors to capture the time course of effects.
Finally, we will examine downstream effects of the interpretation manipulation on child interpretation bias
at pre- and post- visits. We will test moderators (e.g., parent anxiety and gender) to refine theories of
intergenerational transmission of anxiety and inform future personalized interventions. The long-term goal
of this work is to inform personalized, mechanism-focused interventions to improve mental health
outcomes for anxious children and their parents. Future studies will translate knowledge gained from this
project into a scalable treatment that can be implemented entirely remotely via smartphone thereby
increasing access to care."
10837047,"Project Summary
The per-generation de novo mutation rate spans more than an order of magnitude among
eukaryotes and at least a two-fold range among primates. While many studies focus on those
mutations that arise during gametogenesis, experiments have shown that the rate of mutation
is higher during embryogenesis, and that half of all mutations are already present in the
germline at puberty. In this proposal we carry out multiple experiments using pedigrees from
the model nonhuman primate, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), to quantify the number
and types of mutations produced during embryogenesis and gametogenesis. First, we
detect embryogenic mutations in parents by sequencing the genomes of multiple of
their offspring. Transmitted mutations produced during parental embryogenesis will appear
mosaically, enabling us to detect them in some, but not all, offspring. By sequencing multiple
siblings within a family, we will be able to measure the embryogenic mutation rate in an
unbiased manner. Second, we will quantify male germline mosaicism with pooled
sperm sequencing. The frequency of mosaic mutations reveals the timing of their genesis in
development. By deeply sequencing sperm collected from individual sires of the same
pedigrees, we will quantify the frequency of embryogenic mutations and they stage in which
they arose. In addition, pooled sequencing of sperm from offspring will help to estimate the
fraction of embryogenic mutations missed by pedigree studies. Both of these experiments
together will lead to more accurate estimates of the mutation rate during embryogenesis.
Third, we will uncover early embryogenic mutations in the offspring via paired
comparisons with placenta. Mutations arising very early in an individual's development will
appear in almost all cells. To quantify these early embryogenic mutations, we will sequence
placentas from the same sequenced offspring. The placenta separates from the lineage
leading to the embryo shortly after fertilization. Comparing mutations found in the placenta
with those from blood samples of the developed embryo will allow us to delineate the timing
of mutations. This experiment has many of the same advantages as studies of monozygotic
twins, but with tissues that are readily available from a singleton birth."
10825569,"About 10-20% of persons who contract SARS CoV-2 will experience persistent post-acute sequelae of SARS-
CoV-2 infection (referred here as PASC). Given that persistent symptoms are heterogeneous with multisystem
involvement, recent consensus recommendations suggest that a holistic rehabilitation program may be
required to manage PASC and restore function. While treatments offered at emerging outpatient COVID
recovery clinics are being informed by previous similar diseases, the need is great for a better understanding of
the unique needs of this growing population and for tested, efficacious rehabilitation programs to address
them. We provide both here. Specifically, our aims are: (1) To quantify the incidence and severity of PASC
across different variants and their effects on health and functioning; (2) To develop and evaluate the
effectiveness of a patient-centered, interdisciplinary, multimodal comprehensive rehabilitation program among
patients with PASC; and (3)To estimate the costs associated with the proposed PASC rehabilitation
intervention and to examine the relationship between intervention’s costs and effectiveness and their
implication for rehabilitation program initiatives. Data from a large and diverse ongoing longitudinal survey of
persons who tested for COVID-19 at the study health system will serve as the sampling frame from which to
identify and enroll PASC patients in the study. The targeted six-week program will be comprised of a core set
of therapies, including individually titrated stretching and flexibility, strengthening of accessory breathing
muscles and diaphragm, resistance and aerobic conditioning, and vestibular rehabilitation, supplemented by
neuropsychological and cognitive remediation tailored to patients’ needs. Using a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) design, the effectiveness of the intervention will be compared to that of usual care augmented by a one-
time in-person assessment and patient education materials. In addition to walking speed, a widely used global
measure of aerobic capacity and endurance, and patient-reported health and functioning (primary outcomes),
we will assess the intervention effectiveness on: (i) cognitive functioning, (ii) pain, (iii) fatigue, (iv) tension,
stress, anxiety, and depression, and (v) self-management of PASC symptoms (secondary outcomes).
Outcomes will be measured at fixed points in time at 8 weeks (shortly after therapy completion) and at 90 day’s
post- study entry to examine sustainability of effects. Our overarching hypothesis is that that higher
intervention costs in the intervention group will be more than offset by greater improvements in outcomes
implying that, overall, persons in the intervention group will receive more cost-effective care than those in usual
care group. Given the dearth of rigorous scientific evidence regarding effective assessment and treatment of
PASC and the unresolved questions concerning access to and value of post-COVID rehabilitation care, the
results of this study will have significant implications for both policy and program development."
10773111,"The lung is known to undergo changes with aging, including alterations in the airway epithelium. Older people
have higher rates of lung cancer, with over 70% of lung cancers diagnosed in those over age 65. This
suggests that the aged lung cell is particularly sensitive to carcinogenic insults. Very little is known about how
cellular changes with aging in the lung may lead to carcinogenesis.
We have compelling pilot data showing that MUC5AC is increased in the airways of healthy older people, as
well as in a murine model of aging. We have also recently found that we can increase the expression of
MUC5AC in the airway epithelium of cells from young donors by inducing oxidative stress or producing DNA
damage. These findings suggest that not only is MUC5AC increased in the aging lung, but also that specific
aging-related cell stresses drive the upregulation of MUC5AC/muc5ac in aging. The upregulation of MUC5AC
in older cells serves as a link between aging and the increasing risk of developing lung cancer. In particular,
the increased expression of MUC5AC makes the airway epithelium more susceptible to DNA damage and then
potentially creates an environment that is favorable to carcinogenesis.
Our preliminary data suggest that lung aging leads to decreases in Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). SIRT 1 is known to play a
prominent role in aging and DNA damage. SIRT1 is also known to deacetylate Mitogen-activated protein
kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP1). Decreased SIRT1 activity leads to increased acetylation of MKP1, which
increases MKP1 activity. Inhibition of MKP1 in lung cells from aged donors restores MUC5AC to low, youthful
levels. This suggests it plays a key role in the upregulation of MUC5AC in aging.
These data led us to hypothesize that: Aging leads to cellular changes that increase MUC5AC expression,
promoting lung cancer development. In this proposal we will 1) Determine the aging mechanisms that promote
the upregulation of MUC5AC. 2) Elucidate the mechanisms linking aging processes to increased expression of
MUC5AC, and determine how to rejuvenate aged cells. 3) Identify the consequences of aging and upregulated
Muc5ac in a murine model of lung cancer."
10878697,"Trauma-related guilt is common and impairing among trauma survivors, particularly among treatment seeking
Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Guilt is a distressing emotion that arises when trauma
survivors blame themselves for the outcome of a traumatic event and guilt turns to shame when people judge
not just their actions but themselves negatively because of what happened. Guilt is positively associated with
severity of PTSD and depression symptoms, suicidal ideation, poorer psychosocial functioning, and shame.
Among those with PTSD, guilt is one of the symptoms likely to persist after PTSD treatment, suggesting further
intervention targeting guilt is needed.
Although evidence-based trauma-focused PTSD treatments such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) are
effective to treat PTSD and trauma-related guilt, many still experience symptoms or maintain their diagnosis
after treatment, and dropout from these generally 12+ session protocols is high. Veterans show lower
response and higher dropout than others with PTSD. Delivering protocols that are generally 12 or more
sessions challenges the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system given high demand for mental health care.
For these reasons, additional and less burdensome approaches are needed. Brief treatment that targets
mechanisms that are distressing and associated with multiple problems and disorders may be an understudied
but promising way to treat PTSD and other posttraumatic psychopathology. Our work shows that a brief
treatment targeting trauma-related guilt and shame, Trauma Informed Guilt Reduction Therapy (TrIGR), can
reduce guilt, PTSD, depression, and distress among Veterans and help them reengage with activities they find
meaningful. In a preliminary efficacy study with 144 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with guilt from a deployment
trauma, we found large effects in PTSD symptom reduction and moderate effects in depression symptom
reduction in TrIGR compared to supportive therapy. More than 50% lost their PTSD diagnosis and two thirds
showed clinically meaningful change. Dropout was low and attendance was high - Veterans attended more
than five of six sessions on average. Whether TrIGR is no less effective than longer, more resource heavy
evidence-based PTSD treatments disseminated across by VA, like CPT, is the next critical question.
The proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be the first non-inferiority trial of TrIGR and the first to
compare TrIGR to a first tier PTSD treatment, specifically CPT. It will also be the first to evaluate TrIGR with
Veterans from all eras with guilt from any type of traumas, as our previous work was exclusively with Veterans
of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with deployment-related traumas. 158 Veterans across two VA sites will
be randomized to TrIGR or CPT. Exclusion criteria will be minimal so that generalizability will be high.
Treatment will be delivered in VA mental health clinics. The primary aim is to evaluate if TrIGR is non-inferior to
CPT in reducing PTSD symptom severity among Veterans with PTSD who endorse trauma-related guilt.
Secondary aims are to evaluate TrIGR’s non-inferiority relative to CPT regarding depression severity. We will
explore potential mechanisms of treatment, such as the relationship between change in guilt and shame
change in PTSD symptoms and the role of inhibitory learning in treatment outcomes. We will also examine
differential dropout and change in suicidal ideation and psychosocial functioning. The proposed study is critical
to establish whether TrIGR is effective for a much larger group of Veterans and whether it is as effective as
longer treatments already available in VA to inform if TrIGR warrants further study and dissemination in VA."
10740871,"ABSTRACT
Schwannomatosis (SWN) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple non-malignant schwannomas growing
on the spine and peripheral nerves. Patients with SWN overwhelmingly present with intractable, debilitating
chronic pain, severe enough to cause permanent disability. The etiology of pain in SWN is not clear and the
development of novel treatments for SWN and related pain has been extremely slow and inefficient. Treatment
for SWN is limited to invasive surgery, which carries significant risk of further nerve damage. No drug is currently
FDA-approved to halt SWN tumor growth or ameliorate SWN-associated pain. Recognizing that one of the biggest
challenges in SWN research is the lack of clinically-relevant models, we successfully established patient-derived
SWN cell lines and grew them in the orthotopic sciatic nerve and spine mouse models that reproduce tumor-
induced pain. Using these novel patient-derived xenograft models (PDX), in preliminary studies, we found that:
i) tumor lesions that grew in the peripheral nerve cause an influx of macrophage into the dorsal root ganglia
(DRG), ii) SWN tumor-derived Highly Mobility Group Box1 (HMGB1), a key inflammation initiator and
amplifier, regulates neuronal expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), the key macrophage
chemokine, iii) tumor-primed macrophages produce elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine,
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), iv) IL-6 neutralizing antibody significantly reduces pain response but had little efficacy on
tumor growth in the orthotopic SWN PDX model, and v) anti-IL-6-treatment activates EGFR signaling, which
can compensate for tumor growth. Based on these exciting discoveries, we hypothesize that: i) SWN-derived
HMGB1 stimulates sensory neurons to express CCL2, which recruits macrophages into the DRG, ii)
macrophages cause pain response via overproduction of IL-6, and iii) combined IL-6 and EGFR blockade can
concurrently reduce pain and inhibit tumor growth in SWN models. In Aim 1, using orthotopic SWN PDX
models, we will perform loss-of-function experiments to assess the functional role of tumor-derived HMGB1 in
regulating CCL2 expression in neurons. Then, we will study if the neuron (CCL2)-macrophage (CCR2) axis is
essential in macrophage recruitment and pain response, using the adoptive transfer of bone marrow-derived
macrophage from Ccr2-/- mice. In Aim 2, using genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition, we will assess
the contributions of tumor-derived vs. macrophage-derived IL-6 signaling on pain response in orthotopic SWN
PDX models; moreover, we will determine the efficacy of IL-6 neutralizing antibody in reducing pain response.
In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that combined IL-6 and EGFR blockade is effective in delaying tumor
growth and reducing pain response in orthotopic SWN PDX models. Impact: If successful, this study will i)
provide pivotal cellular and molecular mechanistic insights into the role of tumor (HMGB1)–neuron (CCL2)–
macrophage (IL-6) crosstalk in causing pain in SWN, and ii) employ FDA-approved IL-6 and EGFR inhibitors
to simultaneously alleviate pain and control tumor growth in SWN."

Infants experience language in a rich multimodal world in which sounds, sights, smells, tastes, and touches
occur together. How do these modalities, and their presence in the input, contribute to fundamental aspects
of lexical acquisition? We explore how infants exploit multi- compared with uni-modal input as they segment
wordforms from continuous speech and map meanings to wordforms. We hypothesize that the ability to make use
of multimodal information including touch (a fundamental social signal) in the input facilitates infants' language
learning by contributing information relevant to the alignment of word boundaries and the association of word
meaning to wordforms. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1a-c) we determine whether sensory input that incorporates
more modalities aligned with speech input, results in improved segmentation of the speech stream and improved
attention to word edges for infant learners. In Aim 2 (Experiments 2a and 2b) we determine whether sensory
input that incorporates more modalities associated with objects results in improved word learning for language
learners. Our approach builds on our preliminary work showing that (a) caregiver touch+speech alignment and co-
occurrence is common in interactions with infants and (b) infants use multisensory information in early language
learning tasks. The design exploits behavioral and physiological measures to examine whether the alignment
(Aim 1) and/or association (Aim 2) of multimodal touch, speech, and visual cues inﬂuence language learning in
typically developing children.
 The proposed research is signiﬁcant for its clinical and theoretical implications. First, it is clinically signiﬁcant
since exploring the role of multimodal cues on language learning may impact clinical approaches since current
language therapies or interventions concerning the input tend to emphasize auditory alone or auditory+visual
domains, but not tactile ones. Thus, discoveries concerning the child's use of multimodal information which
includes touch in language learning could lead to new avenues for early intervention for infants and toddlers
showing delayed language acquisition or who are at-risk of language disorders. Second, this work is theoretically
signiﬁcant since it explores how multimodal information may help the learner at different levels of representation
(wordform representations, semantic representations) in ways that could constrain the language learning problem.
The ﬁndings from this research will challenge our views concerning what kinds of informational streams infants
attend to when learning language, and thus inﬂuence intervention and parenting practices."
10754880,"Veterans with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) struggle with social integration - participation in work, housing, and
citizenship - due to symptoms, stigma, and psychosocial functioning deficits. This has a tremendous impact on
mortality, comparable to that of smoking and greater than obesity and alcohol abuse. Despite considerable VA
efforts to provide mental health care to Veterans with SMI, programs that promote social integration are
lacking. Veterans with SMI are at especially high risk for poor social integration and suicidal ideation during the
COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgency to advance treatments targeting Veterans' social integration.
This project addresses this need with a group-based, peer specialist (PS) co-facilitated psychosocial
intervention for Veterans with SMI, called “Veteran Voices and Visions” (VVV). VVV targets Veterans with SMI
who experience psychosis, a group particularly in need of support with social integration. Virtual VVV groups
are co-led by VA mental health clinicians (MHCs) and PSs via online video conference. VVV is an adaptation
of a community-based support group model called the Hearing Voices (HV) approach that was developed over
30 years ago in the Netherlands. It has since spread to over twenty-five countries, representing hundreds of
support groups worldwide. The approach facilitates group cohesion around and normalization of the common
psychotic symptoms of SMI: hallucinations, delusions, and social isolation. Despite its global scope, this
approach has neither been formally adapted nor rigorously studied in public health systems, including the VA.
This intervention has the potential to create and foster a supportive community that improves the social
integration of participants by reducing their distress and self-stigma, and increasing self-efficacy. These three
process outcomes are strongly associated with social integration. This proposal is directly aligned with VA
priorities to advance the breadth of existing psychosocial interventions for Veterans with SMI, improve access
via telehealth services, and support Veterans' independence, wellbeing, empowerment, and whole health.
The goal of this proposal is (1) to develop a manual, training guidelines, and a fidelity scale for VVV, (2) to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of VVV, and (3) collect pilot outcome data. The manual, training
guidelines, and fidelity scale will be developed by the research team in collaboration with 4 advisory panels:
Veterans with SMI, MHCs, PSs, and non-VA experts in HV. Then, 5 MHCs and 5 PSs will be trained to use the
new VVV manual, and each MHC-PS pair will conduct a group with the new protocol. Thirty Veterans will be
recruited to participate in these 5 groups and assessments will be conducted at baseline, midpoint, and post-
intervention. Baseline assessments include measurement of psychiatric symptoms, level of distress from
psychosis, internalized self-stigma, self-efficacy, sense of belonging, recovery, and social integration. Follow-
up assessments conducted at 10 and at 20 weeks will include these same measurements as baseline, as well
as a survey and qualitative interview on intervention acceptability. Feasibility data on numbers approached,
enrolled, and retained, and treatment fidelity will be collected. Fidelity will be assessed in two ways: (1)
facilitators will complete self-administered reflection worksheets after each session and (2) research team
members will rate 5 randomly selected audio-recorded sessions from each group for formal fidelity ratings.
The goal of the within-subjects trial evaluating feasibility and acceptability of the manualized VVV protocol for
improving self-efficacy, self-stigma and social functioning in Veterans with psychosis. To that end, the study
will be run using the full collection of measures that would be included in a subsequent RCT. However, since
the study is designed to assess whether the proposed intervention can be successfully implemented in the
target population and to evaluate the properties of a candidate set of outcome measures, rather than
demonstrate efficacy, most of the analyses will be descriptive. This will lay the groundwork for a future Merit
that will support a controlled efficacy study."

The organization of 3D architecture of mammalian genome is one of the major mysteries in biology. The
invention of genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies, or Hi-C, have revealed
a hierarchical 3D genome organization, including compartments corresponding to euchromatin and
heterochromatin; with higher sequencing depth, Hi-C data further divided the genome into largely
invariant topologically associated domains (TADs), which often serve as the boundary for long-range
transcriptional regulation. Recently, with ultra-deep sequencing and improved analysis strategies at
kilobase-scale resolution, Hi-C can identify chromatin loops within TADs connecting promoters and cis-
regulatory elements in an unbiased fashion. Despite these progresses, an unexplored realm is the
relationship between DNA sequence and 3D genome features, especially chromatin loops. It is important
to elucidate how the transcription machinery translates the genetic variants into variable events at 3D
genome levels and leads to transcriptional or physiological alterations. Here we propose to take an initial
step solving the genetics of mammalian 3D genome using a panel of F1-hybrid mouse strains. This is
enabled by our new Hi-C pipeline named DeepLoop which can sensitively and robustly identify kb-
resolution chromatin loops from low-depth allele-resolved Hi-C data. In aim 1, we will generate
comprehensive allele-specific maps of transcriptome, epigenome, and kilobase-resolution 3D genome in
β-cells from a panel of 7 F1 mice generated from 8 founder strains, which cover nearly the entire spectrum
of mouse genetic diversity. In aim 2, we will carry out integrative analyses to reveal the heritable cis- 3D
regulatory modules in β-cells. We will also integrate the existing phenotype QTL, eQTL, and functional
genomics data into our analysis. In aim 3, we will create a map of conserved 3D regulome between
human and mouse β-cells to infer human biology from mouse genetic data. This project will reveal a large
part of the genetics of 3D genome in mouse and serve as a launching pad for future human genome
research."

Respiratory virus infection, an increasing health and social burden alone, also increases risk for development
and exacerbation of other respiratory diseases, including asthma that affects 17 million U.S. people. Viral
infection triggers innate immune response, an important defensive mechanism through activation of the
interferon signaling: robust induction of antiviral proteins including interferons (IFNs) and interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs) through the recognition of viral nucleic acid and activation of subsequent signal cascades.
Specifically, intracellular viral RNA is sensed and recognized by RNA sensors, which subsequently activates
series of signaling cascade to induce the production of IFNs. Secreted IFNs, in turn, activates the transcription
of hundreds of ISGs to amplify innate immune response, a double-edged sword, both constraining viral
replication and without proper control, leading to exuberant inflammatory response that damages airway
epithelium during asthma exacerbation caused by viral infection. Furthermore, such virus-induced asthmatic
exacerbation has a strong genetic basis. Chromosome 17q21 Gasdermin B (GSDMB) region has been
significantly associated with susceptibility and severity of childhood asthma, primarily in children who had prior
respiratory virus infection. However, the mechanism by which how viral infection determines the asthmatic
susceptibility among individuals with various genetic background is incompletely understood, which is the
major focus of the proposal. Notably, the genotype of 17q21 asthma risk allele is associated with increased
expression of GSDMB in human airway epithelial cells. Our unpublished work has demonstrated that GSDMB
is not only sufficient but also required to promote IFNs signaling and induce expression of ISGs in human
airway epithelial cells treated with RNA viruses or their analogue: poly (I:C). We now propose to characterize
the biological and molecular mechanism by which GSDMB determines the risk for asthma following RNA virus
infection. We have proposed a series of integrative and complementary in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches
to 1) dissect the molecular mechanisms by which GSDMB promotes IFNs signaling (Aim 1); 2) establish the
Rhinovirus infection cellular model with prolonged inflammatory response induced by GSDMB in human
bronchial epithelial cells with opposing genotypes of GSDMB (Aim 2); 3) in vivo consequence of prolonged
and repetitive respiratory virus infection in mice with conditional and inducible expression of human GSDMB in
airway epithelial cells (Aim 3). Our deep mechanistic understanding of such gene by environment interaction
will illuminate novel treatment and perturbation strategy to prevent severe asthma exacerbation in susceptible
subjects."
10771265,"The contemporary clinical successes of immunotherapies have highlighted the key role of tumor-infiltrating cells
in mediating anti-tumor immunity and have generally associated the presence of T cells within tumors with
therapeutic response. However, until now, a systematic approach for evaluating how T cell state, their clonal
identity and localization are related has not been possible. In recent years, the Wu lab has achieved several
notable technical advances, including generation of a best-in-class HLA class I epitope predictor (HLAthena); a
highly robust targeted plate-based method for single-cell TCR sequencing (rhTCRseq); and a means to
parallelize the cloning of hundreds of TCRs such that they can be interrogated to definitively link a TCR with its
antigen specificity. Because dynamic interactions between tumor-reactive T cells and malignant clones occur
within the defined spatial ordering of tissue, our valuable new insights motivate us to investigate how the spatial
organization of tumor-specific T cells relates to in situ positioning of tumor clones. We hypothesize that antigen
specificity, which drives the interactions between T cells and tumor cells, impacts the distinct regional localization
of T cells within the tumor microenvironment at baseline and in the context of therapy; conversely, that knowledge
of spatial localization identifies T cell clones specific for distinct antigen types. Slide-seq technology, created by
the Chen lab, provides a tractable and exciting path to investigate this hypothesis by implementing a scalable
approach to undertake in-depth analyses of informative human and murine tumor tissues. By expanding the
capabilities of this unbiased cellular resolution spatial capture method, we aim to gain tissue level understanding
of how the abundance and functional state of T cell clones and their spatial orientation within the tumor
microenvironment are linked. In particular, the study will address the spatial organization of T cell clones and
tumor subclones in human and mouse tumors. Our technology goals will be to increase the efficiency of
transcript capture of the technology, extend the capability to include robust detection of tumor mutations, and to
develop a suite of analytic tools to integrate in a multi model fashion the transcript, DNA-level and TCR levels of
information (Aims 1-2). Focusing on RCC tumors, we will evaluate the cell-cell localization patterns of T cell
clones in relation to tumor subclones and stromal cells through integrated spatial analyses of TCR and DNA
Slide-seq data (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate the impact of antigen specificity (definitively assessed by robust
TCR reconstruction and interrogation methods established in our lab) on T cell phenotype and localization using
TCR and DNA Slide-seq integrated spatial analyses at baseline and following immune checkpoint blockade and
neoantigen vaccine. (Aim 3) Altogether, we will develop and test these tools to understand spatially localized
cellular networks which drive immune response, and T-cell receptor relationships with the tumor
microenvironment. The completion of our work will yield a comprehensive toolset to enable a molecular,
cellular and histological understanding of the tumor immune response."
10766258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal for the Biobehavioral Research Awards for Innovative New Scientists (BRAINS)
program is to understand typical and atypical adolescent development of reward processing and impulsive
behavior. These complex phenotypes are found in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and schizophrenia. Adolescence is a sensitive period for
the emergence of dysregulated reward processing and disordered impulsivity, and for the development of
underlying neural circuits thought to be responsible. However, it is unclear what factors push development
towards pathological trajectories and it is unknown how pathology is encoded by changes in neural circuits.
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) longitudinal study of human brain and behavior is
underway to identify factors in adolescence that predict impulsivity and other reward-related phenotypes.
Similar longitudinal data from mice are necessary to allow molecular, cellular, and circuit-level interrogation of
adolescent development. This knowledge is critical for targeted interventions to alter and prevent
developmental pathology. This proposal develops a framework for mouse ABCD studies. We use an innovative
approach to measure complex behavioral phenotypes in the homecage that allows for testing on a timescale
compatible with assessing the dynamic changes during adolescence. This proposal focuses on the role of
serotonin modulation of corticostriatal projections in driving adolescent maturation of reward processing and
impulsivity. Using transgenic mouse lines for cell-type and time period-specific manipulations, we will
investigate circuit-level mechanisms of serotonin modulation of adolescent developmental trajectories. The
high-risk, high-reward use of in vivo calcium imaging in adolescents will uncover the single cell and ensemble-
level changes occurring in the adolescent brain that supports adolescent behavioral maturation. Using
microendoscope technology we will identify neural changes at the cellular level throughout adolescence, and
define a trajectory of pathological development. These studies will point to a timeframe and mechanism for
targeted prevention and treatment of developmental pathology related to reward processing and impulsivity.
Our results will inform refinement of pharmacotherapies aimed at modulating serotonin signaling in
adolescents for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. This research project
is highly appropriate for BRAINS funding because it directly addresses two key objectives in the NIMH
Strategic Plan and applies novel methods and techniques to advance our understanding of the major
conceptual question of what drives adolescent maturation. As an early career investigator, funding for this
ambitious proposal, which I’m uniquely equipped to carry out, would allow me to launch an innovative basic
research program aimed at understanding the atypical development of reward processing and impulsivity."
10754905,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and
neuropathological changes in the brain. Aging remains the single largest risk factor for sporadic AD, but the
mechanisms underlying this risk are not well understood. Epigenetics has been implicated in both aging and the
pathogenesis of AD. Promising results from our group and others have showed that epigenetic alterations occur
during aging and thereby affect neuronal function, as well as contributing to memory deficits and the
pathogenesis of AD. In the proposed project, we will use mouse models of both aging and AD, as well as human
postmortem tissues, to determine the histone modifications in the epigenome that occur during aging. We will
also determine whether these changes promote the development of neuropathological changes that are
associated with AD. Our hypothesis is that dysregulations of histone modification during aging promote AD by
initiating the development of AD-related changes in neuronal networks at the molecular level. In turn, we also
hypothesize that histonedeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitorscan mitigate or even prevent the neuropathogenesis of
AD. To test our hypotheses, we will first map histone modifications that occur at three critical life stages (3, 12
and 18 months of age) in both wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 mice, as well as human postmortem tissues (AD
patients, young, aged healthy controls), to determine whether differential histone acetylation and methylation
contribute to memory deficits and neuropathological changes associated with AD. This will be achieved through
CUT&RUN seq and RNA seq combined with pathway analysis to determine the functional consequence of
significant genes that are regulated by epigenetics. We will also profile histone modifications at specific gene
promoter regions that are related to memory, synaptic plasticity, and the typical elements of AD neuropathology.
Second, given that HDACs are key factors in histone modification and in the regulation of gene transcription, we
will determine whether dysfunction of any specific HDACs causes memory deficits in AD mouse models. For this
purpose, we will utilize genetic editing tools including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-down and AAV9-eGFP-
mediated
over-expression
to identify critical HDACs (eg. HDAC2 and 3) that modulate histone acetylation and
methylation marks at gene promoters specifically linked to memory and neuronal plasticity. Finally, we will
determine whether HDAC inhibitors have beneficial effects on memory-like behaviors and AD-like
neuropathological changes in APP/PS1 mice (3, 12 and 18 months of age) as well as in age-matched WT mice.
More specifically, we will investigate whether non-selective (i.e., VPA) or selective HDAC inhibitors (i.e., MS-275
and CI-994) are effective in preventing and/or rescuing memory function and neuronal changes in aging and AD
mouse models. Overall, this project will significantly improve our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms
that link aging with the neuropathogenesis of AD. Identification of these mechanisms will lay the basis for
developing novel therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of AD."

During K23 funding, I will become an independent investigator focusing on the neural effects of sex steroids and
their analogues as they relate to behavioral processes. My research aims to improve gonadal steroid
manipulations across the female lifespan. As a critical first step, this research plan will evaluate the effect of
hormonal contraception on reward processing in the brain and assess its relationship to behavioral side effects
and patient utilization. Behavioral side effects of hormonal contraception such as negative mood and decreased
sexual desire represent some of the most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation. Discontinuation of
hormonal contraception is a known risk factor for unintended pregnancies. In order to personalize treatment that
limits such side effects as well as improve tolerability of future agents, progress in steroid neuroscience is
necessary. Current understanding of how hormonal contraception influences brain function has been limited by
a lack of prospective controlled investigations. Utilizing a placebo-controlled design, this project will be the first
to elucidate how a common oral contraceptive agent containing ethynyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (EE/LNG)
influences brain reward function via both neuroimaging and behavioral assessment. This research will reveal
how EE/LNG affects ecologically relevant behaviors (i.e., motivation, sexual function) in reproductive women,
and serve as the basis for investigation of other steroid contraceptive agents on these processes.
My research background in behavioral neuroscience combined with my clinical interests in women’s behavioral
health eventually led to my current focus in psychoneuroendocrinology. Now, as an Assistant Professor at the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), I have significant support and resources to train
to independence utilizing the K23 mechanism. My mentorship team is led by C. Neill Epperson, M.D. and
includes experts in neuroimaging (Drs. Tregellas and Epperson), sex steroids (Drs. Epperson and Santoro), and
statistical modeling (Dr. Sammel). My training objectives include deepening my understanding of: 1)
neurobehavioral effects of sex steroids; 2) advanced techniques in neuroimaging and 3) clinical trials and
statistical modeling. I will also 4) improve my research collaborating, writing and presentation skills and 5) obtain
additional training in the responsible conduct of research. I will accomplish these training objectives through
coursework and seminars, guidance from mentors/consultants, and completion of the proposed research."

In contrast to humans, some animals are able to scarlessly heal and regrow lost appendages after major injury.
Appendage regeneration requires rapid and carefully regulated cell proliferation to replace lost tissue, an
inherently anabolic process. Despite the fundamental need for biosynthesis as part of regenerative healing, we
lack a mechanistic understanding of how injury is coupled to metabolic changes that enable cell proliferation
and growth. Re-creating the metabolic conditions that enable growth is critical to being able to foster
regenerative success in organisms where it is normally limited, such as ourselves. In this proposal, we
leverage two advantages to articulate the metabolic requirements for vertebrate appendage regeneration. The
first is a suite of mechanistic insights from other highly proliferative cell types, which rely on aerobic glycolysis
to convert glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, a versatile biosynthetic precursor for nucleotide and phospholipid
production. Our preliminary data suggest that this is a shared strategy in appendage regeneration. The second
is the unique context-specificity of appendage regeneration in Xenopus tadpoles, which is lost or gained on the
basis of nutrient source, developmental stage, and appendage type. This context specificity gives us the
opportunity to directly compare regenerative structures to their non-regenerative counterparts and to other non-
regenerative structures, thereby defining the specific features of the metabolic landscape that enhance or limit
regenerative outcome. In this proposal we will test the central hypothesis that regenerative success is dictated
by the ability of tissues to rapidly remodel their metabolic landscape and funnel nutrients toward biosynthesis.
We will test this hypothesis by first defining the metabolic paradigm that dominates in regenerative conditions:
glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, or oxidative phosphorylation. We will then identify shared and context-
specific features of metabolic reprogramming, contrasting the metabolic profile of regenerative structures and
non-regenerative structures at different developmental stages of the Xenopus tadpole. We conclude by
building a regulatory landscape of metabolism in regeneration, functionally testing candidate regulatory
transcription factors, and defining how metabolic gene expression is partitioned or integrated between cell
types."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a wide-spread pathogen, infecting the majority of the
population in the United States. This virus poses a significant threat to developing
fetuses as well as to children and adults who lack a competent immune system, often
causing severe disease and mortality. Once individuals acquire an HCMV infection, the
virus remains with the host for life, in a latent or quiescent state in the hematopoietic
compartment. During times of severe immunological stress, the virus reactivates to its
active state, allowing for dissemination and subsequent disease. With the exception of
the immuno-naïve and sero-negative organ transplant recipients, primary infection with
HCMV rarely causes disease, but rather it is reactivation that leads to significant
complications. Thus, to prevent HCMV-associated disease, we must gain a complete
understanding of viral latency and reactivation. One of a handful of genes encoded
during latency is one of the four viral G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), US28. We
have shown previously that US28 is required for the establishment and maintenance
latency and that US28-mediated signaling contributes to these effects. We have also
found that US28 modulates the expression of specific cellular targets that regulate the
Major Immediate Early Promoter (MIEP), a master regulator in the latent-to-lytic switch.
Therefore, we hypothesize that US28 modulates specific host signaling pathways to
regulate transcriptional silencing of the MIEP to facilitate HCMV latency. To explore this
hypothesis, we will take advantage novel approaches coupled with our arsenal of US28-
specific recombinants, as well as both in vitro and ex vivo latency model systems. In Aim
1, we will define mechanisms underlying US28-mediated attenuation of AP-1
transcription factor binding to the MIEP during latency by examining the upstream
signaling pathways that regulate AP-1. In Aim 2, we will determine the factors that recruit
YY1 to the MIEP during latency by assessing US28-regulated signaling pathways and
factors that promote the binding of this repressive transcription factor. In sum, the
experiments proposed herein will lead to a greater understanding of US28’s biological
functions during latency and will lay the foundation for future studies to develop novel
therapeutics specifically targeting the latent reservoir of HCMV infection."

Lung and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. This
high mortality rate is largely due to their propensity to rapidly progress and metastasize. While targeted therapies
for lung adenocarcinoma have improved overall survival, similar advances in lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC)
and TNBC have been stagnant. However, for both cancer types, immune checkpoint blockade and/or
angiogenesis inhibitors improves disease control. Thus, a more complete understanding of how vascular/immune
niches within the tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes LUSC and TNBC will allow us to build upon these
advances. Our teams have recently demonstrated that LUSC and TNBC promote tumor growth and metastases
through a convergence on fibrin remodeling (Nature Communications, 2018; J Clinical Investigation, 2019) and
activation of endothelial cell wound-healing programs (Oncogene, 2019). Fibrin(ogen) that escapes leaky tumor
endothelial cells (TECs) acts as a scaffold for tumor cell motility and creates a provisional matrix for tumor
progression. Using highly integrated bioinformatics and novel LUSC models, we recently found that CCL2-
mediated recruitment of Factor XIIIA (FXIIIA)-expressing inflammatory monocytes (IMs) promotes fibrin cross-
linking, metastases and poor survival in LUSC. We also found that TEC heterogeneity (TECH) directs fibrin
accumulation through a TGFβ/miR-30c/PAI-1 signaling axis - TECs with high levels of the fibrinolysis inhibitor,
PAI-1, increase perivascular fibrin networks that support sprouting angiogenesis and tumor progression. We
have also uncovered a secondary connection between fibrin remodeling and the RNA-binding protein Quaking
(QKI) which is enriched in TECs and drives tumor angiogenesis. Silencing QKI in TECs inhibits sprouting
angiogenesis and metastases, but micro-vessel density (MVD) paradoxically increases; which we posit is due to
CXCL12-mediated sequestering of CXCR4+ IMs that initiate fibrin cross-linking. Based on these collective new
insights from our groups, we hypothesize that (i) inhibition of TEC QKI initially blocks tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis, however, a CXCL12-mediated retention of FXIIIA+ IMs promotes fibrin remodeling and rebound
angiogenesis. Additionally, we propose (ii) that TECH drives the formation of aberrant and persistent perivascular
fibrin scaffolds in LUSC and TNBC via a spectrum of TGFβ/miR-30c/PAI-1 expression. The objective of this
proposal is to elucidate how fibrin remodeling and tumor progression depend on the heterotypic relationships
between TECs and IMs, and the heterogeneity amongst TECs within the TME."

BACKGROUND: Approximately 60,000 patients undergo procedures requiring general anesthesia daily in the
U.S., 60% of which require the administration of intravenous vasopressors to counteract general anesthesia-
induced cardiovascular depression and low blood pressure (hypotension). Many studies have established the
harmful effects of intraoperative hypotension, including myocardial injury, stroke, and acute kidney injury.
Vasopressor therapies to treat intraoperative hypotension, specifically the choice between norepinephrine and
phenylephrine, are debated vigorously. More studies are needed to better understand vasopressor selection
and use and the impact of vasopressor selection on end-organ perfusion outcomes.
RESEARCH: The goal of the proposed research is to conduct foundational studies to obtain essential
background data and to conduct a pilot clinical trial. The first specific Aim is to perform a quantitative
assessment of vasopressor practice patterns and variation across multiple institutions. This data will guide the
sampling strategy of Aim 2, which explores attitudes and opinions of clinicians surrounding vasopressor
selection at multiple institutions with a mixed methods approach. Aims 1 and 2 inform protocol development of
a pilot study which allocates either norepinephrine or phenylephrine as the first-line vasopressor to be used to
treat intraoperative hypotension conducted at the University of Michigan (UM) in Aim 3. The proposed research
and training will provide Dr. Janda with the skills required to transition to an independent researcher.
CANDIDATE: Dr. Allison Janda is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology
and advanced perioperative echocardiography at UM. Through completion of a T32 Research Fellowship, Dr.
Janda has begun to develop expertise in perioperative outcomes research, assessments of practice variation
and clinical trials design. Her long-term career goal is to improve care for patients undergoing cardiac and
major, non-cardiac surgery by better understanding and avoiding perioperative end-organ injury.
ENVIRONMENT: UM is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an
international consortium of over 50 institutions with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal,
MD, MBA is a co-primary mentor for Dr. Janda, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision
Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. Dr. Daniel Clauw, MD is Dr. Janda’s other co-primary mentor and is the
director of the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center and founding director of the Michigan Institute for
Clinical and Health Research. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of her co-primary
mentors, co-mentors including Dr. Michael Fetters, MD, and Dr. Graciela Mentz, PhD, and an advisory panel of
experts in EHR data research, mixed methods research, and clinical trials."

Homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) is a universal, conserved mechanism for the repair of DNA double-
strand breaks and the maintenance of DNA replication forks. While HDR is relatively well understood in
bacteria and lower eukaryotes, glaring knowledge gaps remain in the appreciation of mechanisms in
mammals, because of greatly added complexity including myriad factors that are unique. Notably, several
breast and ovarian tumor suppressors, including BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2, and PALB2, have been implicated
in HDR in mammals, and emerging evidence provides glimpses of the roles that they fulfill. However, a holistic
understanding the molecular mechanisms of human HDR has been hampered by the immense challenge of
expressing and purifying these very large proteins and protein complexes for mechanistic workup. My
laboratory has overcome this challenge, allowing us to demonstrate the pivotal role of BRCA2 in complex with
its obligatory partner DSS1 in facilitating the assembly of catalytically active filaments of the RAD51
recombinase on single-stranded DNA and to reveal a late role of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex in HDR via the
promotion of RAD51-mediated DNA strand invasion. In this proposal, we aim to fill several knowledge gaps
regarding how BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2-DSS1, and PALB2 synergize in two distinct stages of the HDR
process. Specifically, we will apply an integrated approach that encompasses reconstitution biochemistry,
single-molecule biophysics, structural biology, DNA fiber analysis, and advanced cell biology to interrogate
how the aforementioned tumor suppressors and their partner HDR factors, such as RAD54, help promote the
assembly of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and the catalysis of DNA strand invasion within the
context of chromatin. The results from our work will bring molecular and mechanistic clarity to RAD51-
dependent HDR and the preservation of stressed DNA replication forks in human cells."
10798195,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Compromised epithelial integrity is a hallmark of gastrointestinal abnormalities, such as inflammatory bowel
disease and colon cancer, which is the third most prevalent and second most lethal form of cancer. The high
incidence rates of these diseases suggest that we still don’t fully understand the underlying mechanisms.
Recently, we discovered a mechanism that links epithelial tissue integrity with the RNA interference (RNAi)
machinery and with miRNA regulation. We have shown that the adherens junctions, which is an essential
architectural component of the cell, recruit the microprocessor and the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC),
the core components of the RNAi machinery, as well as a specific set of miRNAs, in colon epithelial cells. This
interaction occurs through PLEKHA7, a novel partner of the E-cadherin cell-cell adhesion complex. PLEKHA7
loss results in compromised epithelial integrity, decreased levels and function of a set of miRNAs and in
increased anchorage-independent growth, an indicator of epithelial transformation. Our preliminary data show
extensive mis-localization or loss of PLEKHA7 in colon cancer cell lines and tumor patient samples. Interestingly,
an RNA-CLIP experiment followed by RNA sequencing revealed association of PLEKHA7 with long non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs can interact with miRNAs and the RNAi machinery in multiple ways and a number
of them has been implicated in intestinal diseases. However, our knowledge on lncRNA regulation and function
is still limited. Our preliminary data show that PLEKHA7 loss results in altered expression of a number of these
lncRNAs, including upregulation of MIR17HG, a known promoter of cellular transformation. We hypothesize that
the adherens junctions recruit and regulate the RNAi machinery and lncRNAs to maintain colon epithelial
homeostasis. We will test our hypothesis in two Aims that will determine whether: 1) PLEKHA7 suppresses
MIR17HG levels through RISC and miRNAs at adherens junctions; 2) PLEKHA7 maintains the normal colon
epithelial phenotype through miRNAs and MIR17HG. This study is significant, since it provides a missing
mechanistic link between epithelial architecture and cell behavior and a new unexpected localized regulation of
RNAi and lncRNAs. The proposed work is innovative, because it tethers two previously unrelated fields, cell-cell
adhesion and non-coding RNA biology. The impact of the study is that it will advance our understanding of the
underlying mechanistic causes of intestinal diseases and will lay the foundation for the systematic interrogation
of the newly discovered connection between the adherens junctions, the RNAi machinery and non-coding RNAs."
10909823,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting 1.3 million individuals in the U.S., causing
physical disability, reduced quality of life, premature mortality, and enormous health care costs. Veterans with
RA die from respiratory diseases at a rate three times higher than the general population. Much of this excess
respiratory mortality affecting Veterans with RA is attributable to interstitial lung disease (ILD), which has a
prognosis as poor as many cancers. Despite advances in RA treatment over the past two decades with the
adoption of novel therapies and more aggressive treatment strategies, the optimal management of RA-ILD is
unknown. Two critical limitations for effectively managing Veterans with RA-ILD are 1) the inability to identify
Veterans with progressive RA-ILD—those most likely to benefit from anti-fibrotic or aggressive
immunomodulatory therapies and 2) a lack of data on the comparative effectiveness and safety of disease-
modifying RA therapies in this population. Therefore, the overall objectives of this project are to leverage
unique prospective Veteran RA-ILD cohorts and data linkages within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
to 1) identify prognostic serum and genetic biomarkers for RA-ILD and 2) compare the effectiveness and safety
of RA therapies in Veterans with RA-ILD. Our central hypotheses are that serum and genetic biomarkers will
be independently associated with, and accurately predict, RA-ILD progression, and select RA therapies will
differentially slow ILD progression and improve related survival. In Aim 1, we will utilize prospective RA-ILD
cohorts to identify prognostic serum and genetic biomarkers and derive progressive RA-ILD predictive models.
We hypothesize that biomarkers from RA-ILD pathophysiologic domains—novel disease-related
autoantibodies, genetic markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases—will be
independently associated with ILD progression in Veterans with RA-ILD. In Aim 2, we will link national VHA
data sources and use advanced causal inference methodology to identify RA therapies that are associated
with less ILD progression and improved survival in Veterans with RA-ILD. We hypothesize that compared to
tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), non-TNFi biologic therapies (rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab) will
be associated with less ILD progression and have a lower mortality risk in Veterans with RA-ILD. Impact: The
results from the proposed research will assist clinicians with personalized treatment selection in Veterans with
RA-ILD, a high-risk population with little data to currently guide treatment selection. The PI will complete this
research plan under the mentorship of a multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical and
pharmacoepidemiologic research within the VHA, building upon his early research productivity. The
accompanying mentored training program in pharmacoepidemiology and causal inference methodology
obtained through advanced, immersive coursework and professional meetings will position the PI to conduct
high-impact research in RA and RA-ILD within the VHA. Upon completion of this award, the PI will be poised
for an independent research career targeting improvements in the long-term outcomes for Veterans with RA."

Although new variants may contribute to surges, we expect SARS-CoV-2 to transition to a new phase where
the virus continues to circulate but at lower levels. Sequential immunizing exposures, whether due to infection
or vaccination, have transformed the immune status of populations by cumulatively increasing antibody levels
and increasing the breadth of antigenic targeting of SARS-CoV-2 by antibodies. The relative role of increased
magnitude of antibody responses or broadening of antigenic recognition of SARS-CoV-2 in protecting
populations from infection is not known. Strikingly, though mucosal responses have been found to play key
roles in protecting individuals from infection, SARS-CoV-2 literature has focused almost exclusively on
serological responses. Effective policy and investment in public health measures as the pandemic continues
will require information on the relative importance of specific immune responses. Gathering evidence in diverse
settings including low and middle income countries (LMIC) is particularly important as the immunizing exposure
history in these settings has been different (in terms of infections and vaccine use) and a smaller evidence
base is available from these settings. Our proposed work seeks to continue to interrogate SARS-CoV-2
immunity in a cohort residing in an urban slum community in Brazil which we have followed since 2003. We
identified an extraordinarily high SARS-CoV-2 attack rate (75%) during two epidemic waves with D614G and
Gamma variants. Subsequent vaccination has generated hybrid immunity in a large proportion of our cohort.
Our proposed study would investigate the relative role of antibody magnitude and breadth within systemic and
mucosal compartments in protecting this population from infection. To accomplish this, we propose to conduct
serologic and virologic surveillance in this community and develop tools to interpret serological measures of
infection that address a key epidemiological challenge for the world in continued characterization of infection
during the next phase of the pandemic. Our proposal leverages a 27-year scientific collaboration with the
Brazilian Ministry of Health, an extensive track record of interrogating SARS-CoV-2 immunity, novel assays
and analytical methods to infer infection histories and characterize multi-antigen immune responses. Our study
will generate key evidence to inform the development of novel vaccines (intranasal, multi-antigen) and a new
approach to tracking SARS-CoV-2 infections in populations with pre-existing immunity where symptom-based
virologic surveillance may give an insufficient view of viral transmission."
10768759,"Pancreatic cancer is characterized by mutational activation of the “undruggable” KRAS proto-oncogene, 
and approximately 95% of all pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients harbor a KRAS 
mutation. With an abysmal five-year survival rate of 10%, developing effective therapeutic strategies 
remains a high priority. The KRASG12D mutation represents the most common KRAS mutation in PDAC 
followed by KRASG12V and KRASG12R. However, other mutations, such as KRASQ61L, are 
non-existent in PDAC despite being highly oncogenic in model systems. Thus, KRAS mutations are not 
equal, and each mutant may regulate distinct as well as overlapping signaling pathways. We will map the 
protein interactions of specific KRAS mutants utilizing both 2D and 3D cell models. In Aim 1, we will 
employ a new version of Biotin Identification (BioID) proximity ligation assays, termed TurboID, to define 
the mutation-specific protein interactions. My work on KRASG12R provides an excellent example of 
KRAS mutation-specific signaling. We hypothesize that the mutant-specific effector interactions in 
KRAS-initiated PDAC will illuminate which pathways are most susceptible to therapeutic disruption. In Aim 
2, we propose to expand the Cell Models Core of the CDLD to generate mouse- and patient-derived 
pancreatic organoids for use in our studies and others at MUSC. KRAS signaling varies depending on 
whether cells are grown on plastic (2D) vs 3D environments. To address this complexity, we will extend 
our BioID studies into 3D organoids developed from normal mouse pancreas. This approach will allow for 
the use of a “normal” organoid line to define the mutation-specific signaling differences between KRAS 
mutants. The use of normal mouse organoids will allow for an isogenic “normal” environment that is more 
representative of the natural pancreas environment in which KRAS initiates the early stages of pancreatic 
cancer. To validate whether the mutation-selective effector pathways are necessary in an early cancer 
model system, we will establish pre-neoplastic organoids from KrasLSL-G12D/+ and KrasLSL-G12R/+ 
mouse models, where the KRAS mutation is expressed in the native gene locus to validate the potential 
targets. This approach will help define a new class of mutation-specific therapies in pancreatic cancer."

 APOBEC signature mutations (C to T and C to G substitutions in TCA and TCT trinucleotide

caused by aberrant activity of several members of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, which normally
function in many cellular processes including the restriction of viruses. Recently, we found that APOBEC3A
(A3A) expression is elevated in APOBEC-mutated breast cancer cell lines, resulting in increased cellular
cytidine deaminase activity and breast cancer mutagenesis. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize
newly identified components of the APOBEC mutation signature, determine how A3A mRNA expression is
upregulated in cancer, define proteasomal controls on A3A protein abundance, and characterize DNA repair
pathways that limit A3A mutagenesis. Aim1 will determine the causes and consequences of A3A- and
APOBEC3B-induced insertion/deletion mutations. Aim 2 will characterize the mechanisms leading to aberrant
up-regulation of A3A in breast cancers by identifying the transcription factors and signaling pathways
responsible for increasing A3A expression. Additionally, we will investigate the mechanism(s) leading to
proteasome-dependent degradation of A3A and assess the mutagenic consequences of defective post-
translational control of A3A abundance. Aim3 will characterize anti-mutagenic roles of the homologous
recombination proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 in template switch-mediated bypass of A3A-dependent abasic
sites at replication forks. We will determine whether BRCA1 or BRCA2-deficiency elevates APOBEC-induced
mutation in human cell lines and genetically define additional proteins involved in the pathway. Successful
completion of these aims will enhance our understanding of A3A regulation and its role in cancer etiology.
Additionally, these efforts will identify means to limit APOBEC-induced mutagenesis, which could provide
therapeutic benefit by limiting continued tumor evolution that leads to drug resistance."

Up to 60% of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are non-adherent to cancer treatment
medications and thus at an increased risk of relapse and death. In response, multiple professional
organizations have endorsed medication adherence promotion as a standard of pediatric cancer care and a
critical component of AYA oncology programs. Improving adherence, however, has proved difficult as barriers
to adherence differ across AYAs and each barrier requires a different set of behavior change techniques
(BCTs). Despite this need for tailoring, the two adherence-promotion interventions including AYAs with cancer
to date have taken a “one-size-fits-all” approach and produced non-significant or small treatment effects. This
leaves a critical gap between the recommended standards of care and available interventions to improve
adherence.
The proposed research hypothesizes that delivering an intervention in which BCTs are tailored to address a
given AYA’s top barriers may hold promise for improving adherence among AYAs with cancer. Directly aligned
with PAR-19-309’s call for “novel strategies to improve cancer-related health behaviors [i.e., adherence],” the
purpose of the proposed research is to conduct a pilot feasibility test of a tailored adherence-promotion
intervention for AYAs with cancer. The proposed research also directly responds to the National Cancer
Institute’s current special interest in grants that “test innovative interventions...to optimize patient treatment
regimen adherence” (NOT-CA-20-026).
A pilot feasibility randomized clinical trial comparing this tailored intervention to uniform standard of care will be
conducted. A total of 40 AYAs with cancer from 3 sites will be randomized to the tailored adherence-promotion
intervention or uniform standard of care. Data will be collected to explore the hypotheses that the intervention
meets pre-established enrollment, retention, fidelity, and data completion feasibility criteria and that AYAs will
rate the intervention as easy to use and acceptable. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate
potential group differences in electronically-monitored medication adherence. Findings will be used to inform
subsequent phases of intervention development and testing."

 Chamber specific postnatal growth is the cornerstone of postnatal heart development, however, the
underlying molecular mechanisms are almost entirely unexplored. In preliminary studies, we analyzed and
compared key intracellular signaling activities between LV and RV in neonatal mouse hearts and discovered that
p38 MAP kinase activation displayed a unique chamber-specific and developmental stage specific pattern in RV
during neonatal to adolescent transition. Strikingly, cardiomyocyte specific inactivation of p38 activity in the
developing mouse heart led to lethal cardiomyopathy associated with RV specific induction of myocyte
proliferation and hypertrophy in neonatal mouse heart while the LV was minimally affected. Furthermore, IRE1α-
Xbp1 axis is essential downstream signaling in p38 mediated regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Taken
together, these findings reveal for the first time that two previously established pathogenic stress-related
signaling pathways, p38 MAPK and IRE1α/Xbp1, are also indispensable players in normal chamber specific
development in postnatal heart during fetal to adult transition. In this proposal, we aim to explore this novel
finding by accomplishing the following three specific aims. Aim 1): Determine the functional and molecular impact
of IRE1α/Xbp1 axis in chamber-specific postnatal heart development using novel mouse models with targeted
manipulation of IRE1α/Xbp1 activity. 2) Establish the specific contribution IRE1α/Xbp1 axis in p38 mediate
regulation of chamber-specific growth during postnatal heart development. 3) Uncover downstream targets
underlying chamber specific regulation of p38/IRE1α/Xbp1 signaling in postnatal heart. These studies will
establish for the first time an intracellular signaling network for chamber-specific postnatal development in
neonatal heart and fill a critical gap in our current knowledge in this important area of cardiac biology."

Summary
The overall objective of the Yale Metabolic Phenotyping in Live Models of Obesity and Diabetes (MPMOD)
Animal Core is to provide state-of-the-art husbandry, health care, expedited quarantine, and biosecure housing
and procedure space for assessing and maintaining mice submitted for phenotyping. The MPMOD Animal Core
will continue to reside within the Yale Animal Resources Center (YARC) and will build on the experience gained
from metabolic phenotyping > 10,000 mice as the Animal Core for Yale’s Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center
(MMPC). Precise phenotyping depends significantly on the health status of animal subjects. Stable housing and
husbandry minimize the influence of exogenous factors that could impact phenotyping results and reproducibility.
Mice submitted to the MPMOD will share space with cohorts from microbiologically diverse sources. They, as
well as mice housed in resident Yale colonies, must be protected against potential cross-infection by adventitious
agents. MPMOD investigators also must have ready access to the mice soon after they arrive to begin
phenotyping, allowing animals to be studied at younger ages and minimizing costs associated with the
phenotyping process. To address these requirements efficiently and effectively, the Animal Core will provide
facilities and services relevant to: 1) importing mice for metabolic phenotyping using a risk stratified approach;
2) determining the microbiological profile of each imported cohort (within two weeks); 3) providing stable,
biocontainment housing, husbandry and comprehensive health care for mice for the duration required for the
phenotyping exam; 4) reporting and advising MPMOD clients, Core/Sub-Core Directors and MPOD Director on
the health status of submitted mice and to facilitate other potentially applicable services available to advance
phenotyping. The Animal Core will also participate in developing/revising MPMOD consortium guidelines for
animal care."

Circadian rhythms are 24h oscillations in a variety of processes that are entrained by environmental cues
including light. Molecularly, this “clock” is driven by key transcription factors and feedback loops that generate
rhythmic expression of thousands of mammalian genes in a variety of tissues. Past work has revealed the
impact of circadian rhythms on metabolism and immunity. However, the impact of circadian rhythms on
infection, particularly enteric virus infection, is understudied. Preliminary experiments using the enteric virus
coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) revealed a profound circadian effect on infection: Mice orally inoculated with CVB3
in the morning had viral titers 10-100 fold lower than mice inoculated in the evening. Inhibition of viral
replication in the morning correlated with increased expression of antiviral proteins at this time. Circadian
effects on CVB3 infection were lost in mice lacking certain proteins involved in interferon-mediated antiviral
responses, suggesting a possible link between circadian transcriptional control and innate immune responses
in the intestine. Indeed, expression of an antiviral protein was lost in mice that lack activity of an important
clock transcription factor. Thus, CVB3 infection is under circadian control and rhythmic host interferon
responses contribute to these effects. However, several questions remain. In this work we will 1) examine
mechanisms by which clock transcription factors control expression of innate immune genes, 2) examine the
effect of clock transcription factors on infection with CVB3 and other enteric viruses, and 3) identify and
evaluate cell types in the intestine that contribute to circadian control of enteric virus infection. Answering
these questions will illuminate key, but unanticipated, aspects of intestinal biology that influence enteric virus
infection."

 Antipsychotic drug (APD)-induced metabolic syndrome is a pressing clinical problem affecting millions of
patients. However, the difficulty in modeling their metabolic effects in laboratory animals has significantly
hindered relevant mechanistic studies.
 To this end, we have developed new mouse models that recapitulate human metabolic syndrome caused
by two commonly prescribed APDs (olanzapine and risperidone). Metabolic analyses revealed that drug-induced
hyperphagia is the driving force behind weight gain in both models. Using bulk RNA sequencing, we investigated
how APDs altered gene expression in the hypothalamus—a brain region that is critical for appetite control. Our
analyses revealed that the melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) was among those that were directly regulated by APD
treatment. Furthermore, we found that the obesogenic effect of olanzapine and risperidone depends on Mc4r in
Sim1 neurons. Moreover, we found that APDs reduced hypothalamic Mc4r mRNAs before the weight gain.
Remarkably, whole-cell electrophysiology experiments demonstrated for the first time that olanzapine and
risperidone acutely inhibited Mc4r-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Furthermore, this inhibition was mediated by a postsynaptic potassium conductance. Collectively, these findings
provided the first experimental evidence linking deficits in hypothalamic MC4R signaling to APD-induced
metabolic syndrome.
 In the current project, we propose a multi-discipline approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying
1) how olanzapine and risperidone interact with MC4Rs and perturb their functions; 2) how they inhibit the activity
of Mc4r neurons; 3) how both drugs alter the transcriptional and chromatin landscapes in hypothalamic neurons
at the single-cell level. These studies have important clinical implications based on the suggestions that MC4R
can be a novel therapeutic target for APD-induced weight gain, and that they may guide the development of
next-generation antipsychotic medications with fewer metabolic side effects."
10814367,"Project Summary / Abstract
Signaling by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is essential for learning and memory and cAMP-elevating
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors are in clinical development for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related
dementias (ADRD). RIβ is a brain-specific regulatory subunit of PKA and several RIβ mutations, among them.
R335W and L50R, have recently been shown to cause neurological symptoms, including intellectual disability
in children and dementia in adults. We recently discovered that RIα, the other RI regulatory subunit of PKA,
undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a function of cAMP signaling to dynamically buffer cAMP,
which is critical for the specificity of the signaling pathway. In our preliminary studies, we showed that cAMP-
bound RIβ also undergoes LLPS and the L50R and R335W mutations significantly alter the properties of RIβ
condensates. Importantly, PKA is also involved in regulating tau condensates, as phosphorylation of tau by a
suite of protein kinases including PKA has been shown to trigger tau LLPS. In addition, specific PKA signaling
is critical for CREB mediated transcription and protein degradation, dysregulation of which contribute to
AD/ADRD. However, the functional impact of RIβ condensates in AD/ADRD and the interplay between tau and
RIβ condensates have not been explored.
We assembled a multi-PI team with complementary expertise from two institutions to investigate the molecular
and cellular mechanisms governing PKA/RIβ phase-separation and protection from tauopathy and cognitive
decline during aging and in disease. To this end, we generated mice carrying epitope-tagged wild-type and
pathogenic R335W and L50R alleles of Prkar1b, the gene encoding RIβ. We hypothesize that defective RIβ
LLPS and dysregulated interplays between RIβ and tau condensates are critically linked to AD/ADRD. In aim
1, we will use multiple cell types, including cortical cultures from Prkar1b-mutant mice to study the interplay
between tau and RIβ condensates using biophysical and imaging approaches. Aim 2 seeks to answer the
complementary question how the two phase-separating proteins interact functionally in vivo to influence tau
pathology and memory loss in a mouse model of frontotemporal dementia (hTau P301L). Our proposed study
will not only develop novel tools and mouse models to study the impact of defective RIβ LLPS and interplays
between RIβ and tau condensates, but also establish a collaboration framework for further mechanistic studies
of dysregulated biomolecular condensates in AD/ADRD. A better understanding of underlying mechanisms is
paramount to identify new therapeutic targets and to improve upon the efficacy of therapeutics under
development, such as PDE inhibitors."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social communication, often attributed to
misreading of emotional cues. Despite progress toward understanding ASD, treatment options remain limited.
This is partly due to limitations of animal models of ASD that fail to capture an essential aspect of the ASD
condition – people with ASD have impairments in the motivation to engage in social interactions. We recently
developed an operant model of choice between addictive drugs and social interaction, showing that operant
social reward prevents drug self-administration and drug relapse. Our model highlights the importance of
incorporating social factors into addiction neuroscience to mimic the human condition more closely. Our model
allows us to directly assess both social reward and motivation to engage socially and the ethology of
consequent naturalistic volitional social interactions using machine learning approaches for complex social
behavior. The combination of a novel operant social model and advanced computational neuroethological
analytical pipelines provides a unique toolkit to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social reward
and potential disruption of social motivation in rodent model for ASD. The overarching aim of this proposal is to
study the neural mechanisms mediating social motivation and the impact of Shank3 mutation (a rat model for
ASD). In Aim 1, we will use open-source Python packages with graphical interface and intuitive workflow that
uses pose-estimation, to create supervised and unsupervised machine learning-based predictive classifiers of
social behavior. We hypothesize that Shank3-deficient rat model, but not wild-type rats will show aberrant
social behaviors. In Aim 2, we will investigate the potential autism-like-induced shifts in social motivation using
different behavioral approaches: social seeking, social progressive ratio, and social self-administration despite
negative consequences. By combining our social self-administration model with a rat model of ASD, we will
test the hypothesis that Shank3-deficient rats will show a disruption in social motivation behaviors, relative to
wild-type rats. In Aim 3, we will use single-unit electrophysiological recording into the Medial Amygdala (MeA –
a brain region critical for social behaviors) to identify units encoding rats’ social motivation or potential deficit in
social motivation using a translational relevant social choice procedure. Additionally, we will use optogenetic
approaches to reverse potential Shank3-dependent social motivation deficit in awake-behaving rats. These
approaches will provide new frameworks on our understanding of the role of MeA for predicting aspects of
future social-related events and for using these predictions to guide behavior within a rat model for ASD. Our
proposal will provide new insights into behavioral and neural mechanisms mediating the motivation for social
interaction in rat model for ASD."

The mission of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study is to conduct, facilitate, and promote high impact
research on the etiology and prevention of osteoarthritis (OA) and its consequences of pain and loss of function.
During the proposed 4th cycle of MOST (MOST4), we plan to accomplish this goal through the acquisition,
management, analysis and sharing of data on OA, risk factors and functional consequences of disease. The
primary goal of the MOST4 Administrative Core is to ensure that processes are in place and functioning to
support the accomplishment of this mission. The Administrative Core will manage finances, and the following
interactions: 1) internally among the study units (the Cores (Clinical Data Collection and Management, Analysis,
Imaging) and Projects); 2) with external researchers; 3) between institutions involved in the MOST study
including Boston University; University of Alabama, Birmingham; University of California, San Francisco;
University of Iowa; the funding agency (NIA); reading centers; and specialized laboratories.The Administrative
Core will be under the leadership of Core co-Leaders Drs. David Felson and Tuhina Neogi, supported by an
Executive Committee consisting of the other Cores' leaders. The overall team of MOST4 investigators include a
mix of senior experienced NIH-funded faculty and junior faculty establishing their careers with a focus on studies
of OA, pain and disability. The first cycle of the MOST study (MOST1) was funded in 2001, and investigators
affiliated with this cohort have a long history of collaboration, having published over 180 papers reporting
important findings related to OA epidemiology and risk factors, pain, function, and other outcomes. Among the
unique features of the study has been the multidisciplinarity of its investigators and research. A range of topics
have been studied, including MRI findings in the knee, pain sensitization, biomechanical data such as the ground
reaction force, measurement of muscle function, studies of crystal deposition, assessment of physical activity,
among others. The current proposal for the 4th cycle of MOST (MOST4) represents an expansion of this
multidisciplinary focus. The goals of the Administrative Core are to provide leadership to successfully manage
the overall study's execution; plan, direct and integrate all MOST study activities; provide transparent
communication across projects and cores; and foster cross-project collaboration. We will accomplish these goals
through providing leadership and administrative oversight for the following Specific Aims: Scientific &
Operational Management, including single Institutional Review Board processes; Financial Management; Study
Output Management & Dissemination; Pilot Grant Program; Community Advisory Board Engagement;
Communications & External Collaboration. Through these activities, the Administrative Core will ensure the
successful operations of MOST4 under the strong and collaborative leadership of the investigator team."

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have become a significant public health concern in the U.S. ACEs are
potentially traumatic events that occur to children under the age of 18, including all types of abuse, neglect,
and exposure to household challenges (e.g., having lived with a household member with substance use
disorder). Varying sources suggest that 50-60% of U.S. adults report at least one ACE, and 15-25% report
three or more. These statistics are concerning because experiencing ACEs has been shown to negatively
affect various aspects of adult lives, including health outcomes, relationships, and financial and social status.
Despite this established research, the impact of ACEs has not been studied in the context of caregiving for
aging parents. Extensive prior studies have identified a comprehensive list of risk and protective factors related
to caregiver stress; however, these factors tend to be proximal with little attention given to distal or early life
course factors such as ACEs. Relying on the life course perspective, the proposed research aims to examine
the effect that ACEs have on the experience and outcomes of caregiving for aging parents. Using nationally
representative data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) studies, secondary data analyses will be
performed to address the first two aims: 1) Describe the prevalence and characteristics of filial caregivers who
experienced ACEs, and 2) Examine the effect of ACEs in the association between daily caregiving and short-
and long-term health outcomes. The second aim particularly focuses on exploring caregivers’ physiological
functioning using daily cortisol levels to successfully quantify stress effects associated with filial caregiving. In
addition, qualitative research will be conducted to address the third aim: 3) Explore caregivers’ experience of
ACEs and illustrate whether and how ACEs affect their caregiving experience in terms of stress sources and
the strategies they use to cope with caregiving stress. This K01 award would provide Dr. Jooyoung Kong with
the training required to become an independent scholar and leading expert in later-life family relationships and
caregiving for adults who experienced childhood trauma and adversity. The proposed training plan would allow
Dr. Kong to receive instruction and mentorship toward meeting the following career goals: 1) Increase
substantive knowledge in psychobiology; 2) Obtain advanced training in quantitative research methods and
analysis; and 3) Gain advanced training in qualitative research methods and analysis. The K01 award will lead
to an R01 grant application that will propose to conduct primary data collection to further investigate caregivers
with histories of ACEs informed by Dr. Kong’s newly acquired substantive knowledge and methodological
skills. Ultimately, this research will inform novel programs and policies to improve the health and well-being of
family caregivers whose roles are becoming more significant in the current aging society."
10791779,"Conformational dynamics play essential roles in the regulatory functions of coding and non-coding RNAs.
Many regulatory RNAs undergo these functionally important conformational dynamics as they are being
transcribed, a process referred to as ‘co-transcriptional folding’. While intrinsic RNA conformational dynamics
and co-transcriptional folding can be coupled to elicit biological functions, the underlying mechanisms remain
poorly understood due to difficulties in characterizing and examining RNA conformational dynamics in the
context of co-transcriptional folding. Towards our long-term goal of elucidating how regulatory RNAs function,
the overall objective of this proposal is to integrate breakthrough techniques of solution NMR, computational
modeling, and time-resolved chemical probing to uncover principles of regulation via co-transcriptional RNA
dynamics with specific applications to riboswitches, a class of non-coding RNAs that serve as ligand-
dependent gene regulators and are emerging targets for developing novel antibiotics. During the prior funding
period, we have challenged the conventional working model of riboswitches by showing that, under solution
conditions, the sensing aptamer domain of the fluoride riboswitch adopts the same conformation in the
presence or absence of the ligand. We found that the ligand-free sensing aptamer undergoes distinct
conformational dynamics involving a low-populated and short-lived excited state (ES), where the ES-
mediated conformational transition works in coordination with co-transcriptional folding to regulate ligand-
dependent transcription activation. The present proposal represents a continuum of our conceptual and
technological innovations towards understanding riboswitch functions, in which we aim to establish co-
transcriptional RNA dynamics based regulatory mechanisms, to advance new paradigms for transcriptional
and translational riboswitches, and to perform biochemical assays and mutagenesis to reengineer individual
regulatory steps to test predictions. To accomplish the overall objective, the proposed research details three
specific objectives that feature a gradual increase in the complexity: (1) characterize co-transcriptional RNA
dynamics of the transcriptional fluoride riboswitch, (2) characterize co-transcriptional RNA dynamics of the
translational fluoride riboswitch, and (3) characterize co-transcriptional RNA dynamics of the FMN
riboswitches. Results will be used to test the central hypothesis of this proposal that RNA structures have
evolved to encode distinct co-transcriptional conformational dynamics to facilitate regulatory structural
changes along specific functional pathways. By developing a deep mechanistic understanding of
transcriptional and translational riboswitches, the proposed studies will illuminate fundamental properties of
co-transcriptional RNA dynamics and its role in gene regulation. The conceptual framework and experimental
tools developed in the proposal can further assist the development of RNA-targeted antimicrobial
therapeutics and advance the molecular understanding of co-transcriptional regulation of functional RNAs."

Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery
and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs
(e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which
makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy.
However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes
patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood
stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated
with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line
risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a
small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc)
monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual
rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to
disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care”
monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting
sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable
ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been
achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will
develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for
continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a
novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a-
line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and
seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The
proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide
major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring."

As a barrier organ, skin forms the main defense against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a potent mutagen emitted by
the sun. The mutational damage incurred through this role can lead to melanoma, the deadliest form of skin
cancer. Contrary to expectations, melanoma is more common on body sites that are only exposed to UV
radiation intermittently, such as the back and shoulder, rather than body sites exposed more continuously,
such as the head/neck areas. We recently reported the first catalogue of somatic mutations in melanocytes
from normal human skin and discovered that melanocytes from the back/trunk had higher mutation burdens
than donor-matched melanocytes from the head/neck areas. Based on our mutational observations and the
anatomic patterns of melanoma, we hypothesize that melanocytes on the head/neck areas have evolved
mechanisms to accumulate mutations more slowly than melanocytes from other body sites – likely an
adaptation to counterbalance the higher levels of cumulative sun exposure affecting those sites. If true, this
would alter prevention strategies. Moreover, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which melanocytes
accumulate mutations would reveal molecular strategies to slow down this process and reduce the incidence of
melanoma.
We will test our hypothesis in aim 1 by comparing somatic mutations in melanocytes of different anatomic
origins within-people and in aim 2 by cataloguing somatic mutations in site-matched melanocytes across
people who offer detailed histories of sun exposure. These studies will offer correlative data implicating the
main factors driving up the mutation burdens in melanocytes. A major obstacle to these studies is that it is
difficult to measure somatic mutations in individual cells at a high degree of accuracy. However, we recently
pioneered a workflow to call mutations in individual melanocytes at nearly 100% specificity and sensitivity. To
complement these observational studies, in aim 3, we will measure in vitro the rates at which melanocytes of
different anatomic origins repair DNA damage and dissect the main mechanisms regulating this process.
Towards this goal, we have developed assays to measure UV-radiation-induced DNA damage at single base-
pair resolution in tissue-cultured cells. Taken together, the scientific approaches employed in this proposal are
technologically innovative and will illuminate the mutational mechanisms operating on melanocytes in normal
human skin, addressing major gaps in knowledge that have vexed the skin research community."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is estimated to affect 30 million Americans and incur healthcare cost of $30.9
billion every year. There is an urgent need of a safe and noninvasive clinical tool for accurate staging of CKD,
which is essential for its management. The importance of renal parenchyma perfusion and vasculature
morphology for CKD characterization has been documented by many studies, but is not used clinically due to
lack of translatable imaging solutions. In this project, we will use a novel super-resolution ultrasound imaging
(SRUI) technology, which can resolve 50-micron renal cortex microvessels and measure their blood flow speed
in human, to quantify cortex microvessel morphology and perfusion for accurate CKD characterization.
Aim 1: Technical development. New acquisition and processing methods will be developed to enhance
performance of SRUI through phantom and patient experiments. Novel quantitative parameters of SRUI for
renal cortex will be developed, which includes vessel density, diameter, and tortuosity, as well as mean blood
flow velocity, micro- Resistive Index of arterioles and venules, and perfusion index.
Aim 2: Animal validations. We will study 7 normal pigs and 14 CKD pigs with renal artery stenosis (RAS) to
validate SRUI measurements using independent measurements obtained through contrast enhanced CT,
micro-CT, and histology.
Aim 3: Clinical study. We will study 50 healthy volunteers to establish the normal range of SRUI parameters
and study 116 CKD patients with clinically indicated renal biopsy to investigate the efficacy of SRUI for CKD
staging, using biopsy histology as the reference standard. Statistical difference between CKD patients and
healthy controls and differences across CKD stages defined by histology will be evaluated. The association of
each ultrasound parameter with histology CKD score will be assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression and ROC analyses (receiver operating characteristic) analyses will be performed to assess the
performance of SRUI, conventional ultrasound (renal length, cortex thickness, Doppler renal resistive index,
and shear wave elastography), and clinical parameters (eGFR and proteinuria) for distinguishing histology
CKD stages. A subset (N=45) of patients will be scanned by two sonographers randomly selected from a pool
of five sonographers. Intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to evaluate the inter-sonographer
agreement. The inter-sonographer variance will be calculated to estimate the minimum detectable difference
for longitudinal follow-ups.
Successful completion of this project will result in a safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and accessible ultrasound
technology for accurate characterization of chronic kidney disease to guide treatment decision making."

The transition to menopause (or perimenopause) is a period of unique vulnerability for a woman, in which there
is an increased risk of developing a psychotic disorder or the exacerbation of a pre-existing condition, such as
first onset schizophrenia/psychosis or bipolar disorder. Antipsychotics used to treat symptoms of psychosis, are
not always effective and are often discontinued due to adverse side effects. Further, when given to
perimenopausal women, antipsychotics can worsen common symptoms of this period (i.e., weight gain and
hyperprolactinemia). This is important to note because psychotic symptoms are debilitating and can severely
affect a woman’s quality of life. In the present proposal we will provide a mechanistic understanding into how
aberrant regulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system, by the ventral hippocampus, contributes to symptoms
of psychosis during perimenopause. We will address this using in vivo electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and
behavior with three specific aims: 1) Examine vHipp regulation of VTA dopamine neurons and dopamine-
dependent behaviors associated with psychosis in the VCD rodent model of perimenopause. 2) Evaluate the
impact of age on the psychosis-like effects of VCD. 3) Determine the utility of α5-GABAAR PAMs as a therapeutic
intervention for restoring dopamine system function and dopamine-dependent behaviors associated with
perimenopause in the VCD model. Our overarching hypothesis is that aberrant vHipp regulation of the
mesolimbic dopamine system during perimenopause underlies behavioral changes associated with psychosis.
Furthermore, we posit that α5-GABAAR modulators may have therapeutic utility during the menopausal
transition."
10893930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have had a more than 11-fold higher infection
risk than the general population. Several risk factors for COVID-19 infection among HCWs have been
identified, including the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and inadequate PPE use. Among these
factors, the inadequate use of PPE has been associated with a one-third higher risk of infection. Given the high
incidence of infection, there is a critical need to address the challenges of monitoring and promoting adherence
with appropriate PPE use among HCWs. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce workplace-acquired
infections in HCWs by improving adherence to appropriate PPE use in settings at high risk of transmission.
The overall objectives of this proposal are to design, implement, and test a system (Computer-Aided PPE
Nonadherence Monitoring and Detection—CAPPED) that (1) tracks the team’s PPE adherence using computer
vision and (2) highlights episodes of potential PPE nonadherence on a video-monitoring system. Our central
hypothesis is that continuous monitoring of PPE use by multiple HCWs is a complex, cognitively demanding,
and error-prone task unaddressed by current methods for monitoring PPE adherence. The rationale for this
proposal is that enhanced recognition of PPE nonadherence is a requirement for reducing transmissible
infections in HCWs. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: (1) design and implement a computer vision system (CAPPED) for recognizing PPE nonadherence in a
dynamic, team-based setting, and (2) compare human performance during simulated resuscitations using
direct observation, basic video surveillance, and computer-aided monitoring (CAPPED system). For the first
Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied to recognize the type of nonadherent PPE (headwear,
eyewear, mask, gown, gloves) and the category of nonadherence (absent or inadequate). Under the second
Aim, a customizable visual interface will be designed and evaluated for monitoring and spotlighting PPE
nonadherence with a human-in-the-loop. The proposed research is innovative because it addresses the
challenges of simultaneously identifying nonadherence with several types of PPE used by multiple individuals
in a dynamic setting. This proposed research is significant because it is expected to reduce infection
transmission to HCWs by tracking and eventually alerting them to nonadherent PPE use. The results of this
research are expected to positively impact the workplace safety of HCWs by addressing the limitations of
current approaches to PPE monitoring."
10792954,"The alternative pathway of complement contributes to a wide range of glomerular diseases. Factor H is the
main regulator of this innate immune cascade. Although some patients with kidney disease have underlying
defects in factor H, complete deficiency of the protein is quite rare. It is not clear why kidney is so frequently
the target of alternative pathway-mediated injury. One possible explanation is that endogenous proteins can
function as factor H antagonists, effectively creating microenvironments locally deficient in the regulator. The
factor H related proteins (FHRs), for example, antagonize binding of factor H to tissue surfaces, including
the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). We have also discovered that another class of proteins - the
annexins - act as factor H antagonists on kidney surfaces. Although the FHRs and annexins probably block
factor H from binding other tissues in the body, the high concentration of alternative pathway proteins within
the glomerular capillaries causes preferential activation at this location. Based on these findings, the primary
hypothesis of this grant is that is that the GBM is uniquely susceptible to alternative pathway activation
because the dysregulatory proteins (FHRs and annexins) effectively block factor H from binding this surface,
yet it is simultaneously exposed to high concentrations of activating proteins. Alternative pathway activation
within the glomerulus generates C3a and C5a, which ligate receptors on resident myeloid cells and create
an inflammatory milieux within the kidney. Complement fragments generated in the kidney also stimulate T
cells and B cells systemically. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be pursued. Aim 1)
Characterize the effects of dysregulatory proteins in the kidney. We will use in vitro and in vivo models to
explore the molecular mechanisms that cause alternative pathway activation in the kidney. Aim 2. Examine
the downstream effects of AP activation in the kidney. In this aim we will explore the downstream effects of
glomerular complement activation on cells throughout the kidney. We will also examine whether
complement activation in the glomeruli affects the adaptive immune response systemically. This could
represent a mechanism by which inflammation in the kidney increases production of autoantibodies,
creating a positive feed-back loop. Aim 3. Test novel strategies for blocking complement activation in the
kidney. In this aim we will test the ability of novel engineered proteins to reverse alternative pathway
dysregulation in the kidney. The project is expected to provide an overarching explanation for why the
kidney - among all the organs - is so uniquely susceptible to alternative pathway-mediated injury. These
studies will also test strategies for specifically blocking kidney inflammation. By targeting the underlying
molecular triggers of complement activation in the kidney, drugs can be designed to inhibit these pathologic
processes without blocking complement-mediated immunity systemically. This approach is expected to be
both more effective and safer than currently available treatments."
10919757,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Out of 100,000 children and adolescents, 120 will have Down Syndrome, 56 will die from
sudden infant death syndrome, 15 will be diagnosed with cancer, 12 will develop Type II
diabetes, and 2,900 will have an eating disorder (ED). Although the age of onset for EDs was
traditionally observed in adolescence, onset is occurring younger, with many children
developing EDs by age 12. Estimates suggest there will be 1.9 million new cases of youth EDs
by 2024. Despite the high prevalence, costs, impairment, and deaths from EDs, there is very
little knowledge on what predisposes children to develop EDs. Importantly, early detection and
intervention is crucial: problematic eating behaviors can damage developing brains and bodies,
and untreated EDs carry significant risk for becoming lifelong chronic health conditions,
associated with high mortality rates, societal and personal burden. Our scientific premise,
developed from our past work, is that anxiety and interoceptive deficits (inaccuracy identifying
bodily sensations, heightened or blunted sensitivity to these sensations), as well as deficits in
fear learning underlying anxiety and interoceptive deficits, will predict common, problematic
eating behaviors and cognitions (e.g., restriction, body dissatisfaction, cognitive restraint), as
well as clinical EDs. Our study goals are to (1) test if childhood anxiety and interoceptive deficits
are risk factors for problematic eating behaviors and cognitions and EDs and (2) test if deficits in
fear learning are a mechanism by which anxiety and interoceptive deficits contribute to risk.
These goals will ultimately lead to (a) tools that can better detect childhood risk factors for EDs
and (b) prevention efforts directly targeting mechanisms predictive of ED onset. The proposed
research uses innovative parent-report momentary assessment combined with well-established
diagnostic, behavioral, observational, and physiological assessment. We will recruit a sample of
400 girls across two age cohorts (6-8; 10-12 years old) enriched for interoceptive deficits,
anxiety, and EDs; 75% (n=300) will be recruited based on maternal history of EDs or anxiety,
and 25% (n=100) will make up the control group. This study will, for the first time, allow us to
begin to quantify how early symptoms of ED develop. The specific aims are to test (1) multi-
modal aspects of anxiety and (2) characteristics of interoceptive deficits that may prospectively
predict problematic eating behaviors and cognitions and EDs, and (3) mechanisms of prediction
among anxiety and interoceptive deficits. The proposed research has clinical impact: ultimately,
this study will lead to early detection and prevention of EDs in childhood and beyond, averting
the large personal and societal costs associated with both childhood onset and chronic EDs."

Food is perceived and enjoyed through the multisensory quality of “flavor”, which involves the senses of taste
and smell, but is not easily dissociated into its components. Flavor perception has a major influence on food
choice and is thus directly linked to health. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain mysterious.
Previous work in humans has suggested that the brain actively combines taste and smell inputs to create our
sense of flavor, and that this process depends heavily on eating experience. However, human imaging
techniques lack spatial and temporal resolution to provide a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuits
produce multisensory flavor representations. Moreover, people’s highly subjective eating history precludes a
systematic understanding of how experience drives the development of flavor processing. To overcome these
issues, the present proposal takes a unique approach to the study of flavor. Using the awake, tasting rat as an
animal model allows us to directly access to the neural computations underlying flavor processing at the cellular
level, and complete control over the individual’s flavor experience. The proposed hypotheses build directly on
our own recent findings on cross-modal flavor processing in rat olfactory cortex, as well as decades of work on
the development of multisensory computations in cortical and subcortical regions of other multisensory systems.
The project comprises a coherent series of experiments that systematically seeks to provide mechanistic
understanding of the neural circuits that integrate flavor-related sensory information. Specifically, we will answer
the following questions: 1) What are the guiding principles by which olfactory cortical circuits integrate taste and
smell inputs? To address this, we will use electrophysiological techniques to record responses from olfactory
cortical neurons to taste-smell mixtures as well as their unisensory components in awake adult rats; 2) How are
the multisensory operations performed by olfactory cortical circuits shaped by experience with specific flavors?
To address this, we will experimentally manipulate rats’ experience with specific taste-smell mixtures, and record
responses from ensembles of olfactory cortical neurons to congruent, incongruent and unexposed taste-smell
mixtures as well as their unisensory components; and 3) How does the ability to integrate cross-modal inputs
develop across the lifespan? To address this, we will track uni- and cross-modal responsiveness of olfactory
cortex in awake rats across different stages of early postnatal development; To successfully achieve these
objectives, our unique team of investigators brings together expertise in flavor processing and awake rodent
olfactory cortex physiology (PI Maier), the computational basis of multisensory interactions (Co-I Rowland), and
the development of multisensory systems (Co-I Stein)."
10734778,"Recently, WHO and CDC designated Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) a Priority 1 ‘critical
superbug’ and an ‘Urgent Threat’, and warned that new treatments for superbugs, which kill nearly 50,000
Americans and Europeans a year, are unlikely to be developed in time if left to market forces alone. Few
therapeutic options are left to treat CRE, and the fear of ‘pan-resistant’ CRE has emerged. Currently, most CRE
infections occur in a hospital setting, but the potential spread of CRE in the community also exists. Entirely new
agents with novel mechanisms of action languish; completely novel antibacterials with a new mechanism of
action and lacking clinical cross-resistance to existing drug classes are urgently needed. Our proposal aims to
develop a mechanistically novel, IV and PO administered agent to treat uncomplicated and complicated UTI
cases caused by antibiotic susceptible and multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including extended spectrum
beta-lactamase producers and CRE. Using an innovative overexpression-based co-culture screen in Escherichia
coli (Ec), we identified four structurally distinct series of small molecule inhibitors targeting MsbA, an essential
and broadly conserved Gram-negative (GN) ABC transporter responsible for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
biogenesis and construction of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM). A prioritization of the four series
through our current R21AI146541-supported program has enabled selection of a series to enter the Lead

Aim 1 (2 years) - Lead ID to select a single lead series with WT activity and efficacy for Aim 2 Lead

determine Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 1.9) synthetic scale up, 1.10) dose-ranging mouse PK/formulation studies,
and 1.11) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model of WT Ec infection.
Aim 2 (3 years) - Lead Op to prepare a Pre-Clinical Candidate (PCC) for subsequent safety studies: 2.1)

2.4) single mouse (IV, IP, PO) PK, 2.5) validate MOA and FOR, 2.6) test in vitro mammalian off target-activity,
2.7) expanded Enterobacteriaceae MIC90, 2.8) dose-ranging mouse PK, 2.9) synthetic scale up, 2.10) efficacy
in murine UTI model, 2.11) identify PK/PD index, 2.12) expanded off target-activity as in 2.6."
10747413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain is highly prevalent and costly to individuals and society. Once chronic, pain is very hard to treat
or reverse making early identification key for prevention and early treatment to improve long-term outcomes.
Recent brain imaging data from our lab as well as others have provided evidence that the structural properties
of the limbic brain, such as the volume and/or shape of nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and hippocampus
can predict the likelihood of “chronification” of low-back pain after an episode of sub-acute low back pain (SBP)
(duration 6-12 weeks). The role of the limbic brain in predicting vulnerability or resilience to chronic pain fits with
the general understanding that chronic pain is partly due to an interaction between peripheral nociceptive input
and vulnerable limbic brain circuitries, which are known to mediate the negative affective and aversive learning
associated with chronic pain. Hence, understanding how the structural properties of the limbic brain circuitries
predict risk or resilience to chronic pain in humans is innovative and has high translational significance.
 However, the brain imaging studies of the transition to chronic pain remain very limited in number and
scope and, hence, we still have a poor understanding of the exact limbic circuitry and structural connectivity
underlying risk of or resilience to chronic pain. To date, only one small study reported that local white matter
properties can predict resilience to pain chronification. Furthermore, no brain imaging study of pain chronification
investigated the role of important biological variables like sex or established clinical phenotypes like the presence
or absence of a neuropathic component of the low back pain. Therefore, the overarching aim of this proposal is
to use state of the art structural mapping techniques to study local anatomical properties (e.g. volume, shape,
neurite orientation) and white matter connectivity to identify biomarkers for pain chronification. We will use 2
different approaches, one based on biologically plausible hypotheses, and one based on data driven hypotheses
identified in our preliminary data. In addition, the proposal will explore the effect of sex and clinical low-back
pain phenotypes on theses biomarkers. We will recruit SBP patients and obtain brain anatomical and multi-shell
diffusion weighted imaging data at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Patients will be classified as recovered
or persistent after the follow-up visit. Aim 1 will test baseline local and global gray, white matter differences
between recovered and persistent patients in areas of the limbic brains like NAc, amygdala, hippocampus,
anterior cingulate cortex, and white matter pathways known for their role in chronic pain (e.g., the cingulum
bundle and internal capsule) and assess whether these measures change at follow-up. Aim 2 will use a data-
driven approach to examine global and local gray, white matter properties predicting risk or resilience to chronic
pain. Finally, aim 3 will explore the effect of sex and presence or absence of radiculopathy symptoms on the
biomarkers identified in Aims 1 and 2."

The U42 SPF 4 Rhesus macaque breeding colony for AIDS research produces MHC class-1 typed rhesus
macaques (Macaca mulatta) who are negative to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-lymphotropic
virus (STLV-1), simian retrovirus (type D restrovirus or SRV), and macacine herpesvirus-1 (BV). SPF4 Indian
origin rhesus macaques are the premier animal model for HIV/AIDS research, including studies of HIV
pathogenesis, AIDS-related opportunistic infections, and the development of HIV treatments and vaccines.
Demand for this resource continues to grow, and is projected to increase over the grant cycle. A predictable
supply of disease-free, genetically characterized nonhuman primates is critical in the fight against HIV/AIDs.
The overall aim of the Husbandry and Management Core is to maintain the ONPRC Specific Pathogen Free
(SPF) rhesus macaque breeding colony for AIDS research at a targeted population of 175 adult breeder
females capable of producing at least 120 surplus animals annually for research use. To achieve this we will
provide innovative team based management practices including new social monitoring strategies, a weight
management program for at-risk infants, serologic assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis screening, and
introduction of an artificial insemination program to expand genetic diversity."
10804732,"Chronic low-grade inflammation, a hallmark of advancing age termed inflammaging, has been implicated in
metabolic dysfunction. Senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest associated with advancing age,
occurs in response to stressors such as telomere dysfunction, DNA damage, and oxidative stress, and leads to
the release of a host of inflammatory mediators including cytokines and chemokines. These secreted factors
are collectively termed the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). One function of SASP is the
recruitment of immune cells to promote clearance of senescent cells from tissues. While increased senescent
burden in both solid organs (i.e.; liver, adipose tissue) and immune cells, also known as immunosenescence,
likely contributes to inflammaging, the interplay between the two, the mechanisms governing these processes,
and how they lead to metabolic dysfunction are poorly understood. Recently, we have demonstrated
substantial T cell and macrophage accumulation in the adipose and liver of old mice and found that depletion
of T cells in these mice reduces tissue inflammation and improves systemic metabolism. In addition to immune
cell accumulation, immunosenescence, particularly in the adaptive immune system, may also contribute to
age-related dysfunction by both reducing the ability of recruited immune cells to clear damaged cells from
tissues and by exacerbating local inflammation. Indeed, preliminary data suggest that treatment of old mice
with a known senolytic drug cocktail, dasatinib and quercetin (D&Q), reduces adipose tissue senescence and
SASP, improves metabolic function, as well as reduces T cell accumulation in adipose of aged mice. These
data implicate tissue senescence in the recruitment of immune cells, inflammaging, and metabolic dysfunction.
Here, we will elucidate the effects of aging on tissue and immune cell senescence, T cell/macrophage
accumulation, and inflammation, as well as how these interact to impair metabolic function in advancing age."

The nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 3 (NSD3) belongs to the family of NSD histone
methyltransferases, which are responsible for mono- and di-methylation of lysine 36 on histone 3 (H3K36me1/2).
Increasing number of studies link NSD3 to various cancers, including lung, breast, pancreatic and bladder
cancers. Resent study implicates NSD3 as an oncogene in aggressive lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC),
which represents a sub-type of non-small cell ling cancer with very poor clinical outcome. NSD3 in amplified
and/or overexpressed in LUSC, and its role as an oncogene in this sub-type of lung cancer has been well
validated using genetic studies, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of NSD3 plays a
critical role in LUSC oncogenesis, supporting that small molecule inhibitors of the catalytic SET domain of NSD3
could represent new therapeutics for lung cancer patients. However, NSD3 inhibitors have not been reported to
date, but are highly desired as new potential therapeutics for patients with LUSC and other cancers with NSD3
amplifications. In this project we propose to develop NSD3 inhibitors by performing high throughput screening
(HTS) at CCG, University of Michigan. The HTS will focus on identification of small molecule inhibitors of the
catalytic SET domain of NSD3. To date, we developed and validated a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay that
will be used as a primary screening assay for HTS to identify NSD3 inhibitors. Small molecules identified by HTS
will be validated for binding to NSD3 and for inhibition of its catalytic activity using a series of biochemical and
biophysical experiments, including NMR, ITC, and histone methyltransferase assays. Activity of the most potent
compounds will be characterized in cell-based studies to assess inhibition of NSD3 in mammalian cells and
understand their mechanism of action. Selected NSD3 inhibitors will be tested in a panel of lung cancer cell lines
with NSD3 amplifications and/or overexpression for their activity, selectivity, and mechanism of action. In
summary, we expect to identify highly valuable chemical probes selectively targeting catalytic SET domain of
NSD3, which will be suitable for mechanistic studies in cancer cells. This project will pave the way towards
development of more potent NSD3 inhibitors that will be appropriate for in vivo studies in lung cancer models
and for future therapeutic implications."

Plasmodium vivax parasites threaten half of the world’s population and are surprisingly resilient to on-going
malaria elimination efforts, partially due to their ability to remain dormant in the liver as hypnozoites for weeks or
months. Here, we propose to conduct state-of-the-art transcriptomic, epigenomic and lipidomic analyses using
materials collected from non-human primates infected with P. vivax, and in vitro infections of human hepatocytes
with patient-derived P. vivax sporozoites. Our analyses will provide a comprehensive perspective on the
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the onset, maintenance and exit of P. vivax dormancy, and well
as on the response of the host, from the infected hepatocytes to the organ- and organism-wide responses. Our
findings will not only provide a better understanding of the fundamental processes underlying the fate and
development of liver-stage P. vivax parasites but will also provide a solid foundation to develop better malaria
vaccines and therapies against this important but understudied human pathogen."
10795023,"Although critical for development, the placenta is one of the least understood organs in the body. Cells belonging to the trophoblast lineage mediate proper implantation and placentation as well as the hematopoietic, vascular, and immunological properties of the placenta. Defects in proper trophoblast differentiation cause early pregnancy failure and other pregnancy-related disorders, but the molecular mechanisms of human trophoblast differentiation remain poorly understood. So far, only a few transcription factors (TFs) are known to play important roles in trophoblast lineage specification, and their functions are primarily characterized in mice, not human. Furthermore, how these TFs form global gene regulatory networks with other regulators, or their target cis-regulatory elements is not well understood. The objective of the proposed research is to delineate transcriptional regulatory networks and global regulatory logics modulating trophoblast lineage differentiation by utilizing human trophoblast stem (TS) cells and their differentiation towards syncytiotrophoblast (ST) and extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT) as model systems via systems and molecular biology approaches. We hypothesize that mapping trophoblast cell-specific enhancers will allow us to define novel key TFs that control the self-renewal and differentiation of human trophoblast lineages. Our preliminary studies in both mouse and human TS cells revealed that most previously known trophoblast lineage markers are located close to enhancer clusters (ECs) that we have mapped in each cell type, supporting our hypothesis. Our objectives are to 1) comprehensively define human TS cell, ST, and EVT- specific enhancers and ECs, and subsequently identify EC-associated putative key regulatory TFs, 2) functionally validate putative key TFs in self-renewal and differentiation of TS cells to ST and EVT in vitro and in vivo, and 3) reconstruct the core transcriptional regulatory networks modulating human TS cells, ST, and EVT by mapping both native protein interacting partners and chromosomal targets of key TFs. Our proposed studies will provide critical new data in this field, enable a systems-level understanding of early trophoblast differentiation, and create an important resource to gain further insights into the molecular regulatory mechanisms of how extra-embryonic cells are specified, maintained, and lineage-restricted during human development. Our results will help guide future biomedical advances for detecting and treating pregnancy- related disorders."

Type IA topoisomerases are ubiquitous in the three kingdoms of life, and play critically important roles in
maintaining proper DNA topology during the vital cellular processes of replication, transcription, recombination,
and repair. The PI’s research activities have provided seminal biochemical and structural findings for this class
of essential genome regulator, and continue to address key questions on the catalytic mechanism of type IA
topoisomerases and provide new insights into their functional and regulatory interactions. This information is
needed to utilize type IA topoisomerases present in every bacterial pathogen as a novel therapeutic target for
finding new antibiotics to help face our serious global health challenge of antibiotic resistance. Type IA
topoisomerases catalyze the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by cleaving a single DNA strand in the
underwound duplex DNA and passing the complementary DNA single strand through the break before
religation of the cleaved strand to change the DNA topology. The molecular mechanism of the large enzyme
conformational changes that are required for the coordinated movement of the passing DNA in and out of the
DNA gate is the critical barrier for elucidating how bacterial TOP1 can relax negatively supercoiled DNA with
high efficiency to prevent hypernegative DNA supercoiling and R-loop stabilization that can arise during
transcription. This important function of bacterial TOP1 is facilitated by the direct TOP1 interaction with RNA
polymerase that we have characterized and found to be targeted by endogenous toxin in mycobacteria. For
future studies, we will create new TOP1 mutants perturbed in interdomain interactions at a distance from the
active site and investigate the effect on the in vivo relaxation activity and in vitro interactions with DNA
substrate. Mutants with reduced catalytic efficiency will be further studied to determine if the mutations affected
the gate opening-closing dynamics and DNA strand passage. We will capture new structural conformations of
the TOP1-DNA complex that may represent different stages of the catalytic cycle with X-ray crystallography
and measure the gate opening-closing dynamics with single molecule assays. Structural studies will also
incorporate other ligands including RNA. Type IA topoisomerases have evolved to include TOP1 and TOP3
enzymes in all three kingdoms of life that possess dual activities on both DNA and RNA substrates. The RNA
topoisomerase activity of human TOP3B has been shown to be required for neurodevelopment and the
enzyme is also involved in R-loop suppression and genome stability. We are modeling the RNA interaction of
type IA topoisomerases with molecular dynamics simulations to determine how the DNA and RNA substrate
may be accommodated differentially by change in enzyme conformation and interacting residues. We have
initiated studies to identify a separation of function mutation or small molecule probe that can be used to
distinguish between the DNA and RNA topoisomerase activity in vivo. Such research tools for study of cellular
RNA topoisomerase activity and regulation will have an important and lasting impact on the field."

Currently approved stroke therapies include underutilized, time-limited, systemic thrombolysis and mechanical
recanalization options. Therefore, there is a need for more affordable and flexible approaches to treatment that
can be disseminated widely. One approach includes targeting robustly expressed innate pathways such as the
Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signaling pathways activated after focal cerebral ischemia. There is a lack of
knowledge regarding the timing and cellular specificity of downstream pathways activated by pathways such as
TLR4 in astrocytes and other components of the neurovascular unit. In this proposal, we will determine the key
downstream targets in astrocyte TLR4 signaling and the effect of astrocyte-specific TLR4 signaling on blood
brain barrier permeability (BBB) and neurobehavioral outcomes following acute focal cerebral ischemia. We
will use a clinically relevant, endogenous danger associated molecular pattern (DAMP), HMGB1, a known
TLR4 ligand to determine the key downstream targets in astrocyte TLR4 signaling. We will also use in vitro
models of ischemia, such as Oxygen Glucose Deprivation (OGD), to determine the TLR4-dependent
downstream pathways activated by other DAMPs in astrocytes. Characterization of the downstream effectors
of astrocyte TLR4 signaling has important implications for decreasing BBB permeability and secondary brain
damage and improving outcomes after stroke. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that stroke-induced,
astrocyte-specific TLR4 signaling induces BBB disruption in the acute phase of stroke, and that inhibiting
ischemia-relevant DAMP-TLR4 signaling in astrocytes will decrease BBB permeability following acute focal
cerebral ischemia and improve behavioral outcomes. This central hypothesis will be tested in the following
aims: Aim 1: We will determine the signaling pathways active in TLR4-reactive and TLR4 non-reactive
penumbral astrocytes using a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and transcriptomics following
acute cerebral ischemia Aim 2) Using HMGB1 stimulation of cultured astrocytes and an in vitro model of
cerebral ischemia, OGD, we will identify downstream targets of TLR4 signaling in astrocytes via Western blot
and phosphoproteomics. Aim 3: Using mice with inducible, astrocyte-specific deletion of TLR4, we will
determine the effect of astrocyte-specific TLR4 deletion on BBB permeability and neurobehavioral outcomes
following MCAO. At the end of these studies, we will have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms
that underlie TLR4 signaling in astrocytes. Results from these studies will lay the foundation for the
development of novel therapeutics that can decrease brain damage after stroke."

Childhood asthma is the most common chronic respiratory condition in the U.S. While
epidemiological studies have identified risk factors (e.g., severe bronchiolitis) for childhood
asthma, the underlying mechanisms of asthma development (and its different phenotypes)
remain poorly understood. This major knowledge gap has hindered efforts to develop asthma
prevention strategies. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) study
(U01AI087881; Camargo, PI) is an ongoing 17-center cohort study that enrolled 921
hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis (median age, 3 months) during 2011-2014. In this
racially/ethnically- and geographically-diverse cohort, investigators have collected high-quality
biospecimens, including nasopharyngeal airway and blood samples at the index hospitalization.
Follow-up data include biannual parent interviews, medical record reviews, and in-person exam
at age 6 years, with ~80% follow-up to date. The present K01 project would extend this large
well-characterized bronchiolitis cohort by integrating genome, metabolome, and microbiome
(both 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing) data, which will not only elucidate the
mechanisms of incident asthma but also identify its endotypes. In Aim 1, we will determine the
integrated relationships of host genome and nasopharyngeal airway metabolome in infancy with
asthma development by age 6 years. In Aim 2, we will determine the integrated relationships of
host genome and nasopharyngeal airway microbiome (both structure and function) in infancy
with the risk of developing asthma by age 6 years. Finally, in Aim 3, we will identify clinically-
relevant endotypes of childhood asthma by integrating clinical, immunological (e.g., specific IgE,
25OHD, cytokines), and multi-omics data (i.e., host genome, serum metabolome, and airway
microbiome) at age 6 years. Our pilot data provide compelling support to the proposed work.
This K01 project will provide a unique opportunity to define the pathobiology of incident asthma
through examining the integrative role of genome, metabolome, and microbiome. Furthermore,
we will also define childhood asthma endotypes by leveraging multi-omics data in the
comprehensively-phenotyped MARC-35 cohort. These findings will lead to the development of
endotype-specific prevention strategies for asthma (e.g., through modulation of metabolism
pathways and microbiome) during early childhood. The mentoring team consists of NIH-funded
researchers with international expertise in all relevant fields. The study matches well with the
2017 NIAID Strategic Plan, which both ultimately aim to prevent allergic diseases, such as
asthma."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) afflicts over three million people in the USA, is increasing worldwide, and
leads to colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). We are seeking new adjunctive IBD therapies that are safe,
effective, and inexpensive that could also reduce risk for CAC. Spermidine (Spd) is a polyamine generated from
putrescine and from back-conversion of spermine by spermine oxidase (SMOX). Recent high-impact studies
have shown that Spd supplementation improves cardiovascular health, longevity and quality of life in aging, and
does not increase the risk for cancer. Spd has been used successfully in Phase I clinical trials. We have
developed a sensitive, accurate mass spectrometry-based assay for polyamine detection, which has enhanced
our capabilities for this project. Our recent discoveries support the use of Spd as a new strategy for colitis
treatment and CAC prevention. The long-term goal is to further elucidate the scope and mechanisms underlying
the protective effect of Spd to gain insights needed for future human clinical trials in IBD. Our proposed studies
are supported by our data indicating that: 1) Expression of SMOX, a key source of Spd, is reduced in patients
with ulcerative colitis (UC) and associated dysplasia. 2) Mice with Smox deletion have reduced Spd in the colon
and exacerbation of both dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis, a model with features of UC, and CAC in the
azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model. 3) Spd supplementation restores colon Spd levels and protects against colitis
and CAC. 4) Spd is the substrate for generation of hypusine, an amino acid produced by deoxyhypusine synthase
(DHPS), which is required for a highly specific form of protein translation, hypusination, involving activation of
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) and formation of hypusinated EIF5A (EIF5AHyp). DHPS levels
are low in UC patients. EIF5AHyp is reduced by Smox deletion and restored by Spd during DSS colitis and AOM-
DSS-induced CAC, regulates macrophage function, and enhances colonic epithelial restitution. 5) Electrophiles,
such as levuglandins (LGs), are damaging products of lipid peroxidation that can lead to immune dysfunction
and neoplastic risk by forming adducts with proteins and DNA; we found increased adducts in human UC and
CAC, and a specific scavenger of electrophiles reduced adduct formation and carcinogenesis in the AOM-DSS
model. Importantly, we demonstrate that Spd can scavenge LGs. We hypothesize that potential benefits of Spd
in colitis and carcinogenesis are due to effects on immune responses, epithelial function, hypusination, and
electrophile scavenging. Our Aims are: 1) To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of protection by
Spd in acute and chronic colitis models and CAC, including effects on the transcriptome/metabolome, autophagy,
and immune cell versus epithelial cell function using transgenic mice with cell-specific human SMOX expression.
2) To determine if Spd acts through hypusination, using mice with epithelial- or myeloid-specific deletion of Dhps.
3) To determine the role of Spd as an electrophile scavenger in reducing inflammation, genomic instability, and
tumorigenesis. We expect to deliver a new strategy for colitis treatment in IBD and for CAC prevention."

Recent advances in stem cell science have led to accelerated progress in cardiac regeneration. Our group
successfully achieved large-scale re-muscularization of the infarcted hearts of macaque monkeys by
transplanting human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs). These cardiomyocytes
restored ejection from ~40% to ~62%, the largest restoration of cardiac function of which we are aware. This
therapy is complicated by the appearance of transient ventricular arrhythmias, which last for several weeks
before disappearing. Our electrophysiological studies indicate that the arrhythmias result from pacemaking
activity, which in turn results from the immaturity of the hPSC-CMs at the time of transplantation. The main
goal of this proposal is to enhance the maturation of hPSC-CM to make them non-arrhythmogenic, using
metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. In Aim 1 we build on our observations that modulating
metabolism has wide-ranging effects on maturation, including reducing automaticity, and increasing
physiological hypertrophy, force production, and more adult-like calcium cycling. The most powerful metabolic
interventions, substrate switching, metabolic hormones, and energy sensing, will be systematically optimized to
enhance electrical maturity in vitro. Once optimized, we will explore the underlying mechanisms, and then test
whether this maturation reduces arrhythmias by transplanting them into porcine hearts. Aim 2 takes advantage
of a recently generated resource, where we performed RNA-seq on a timed series of human myocardial grafts
in the rat heart as they matured to adult levels in vivo. By comparing these data to immature cardiomyocytes,
we identified a set of transcriptional regulators that are candidate drivers of maturation. We will perform
CRISPR-based gain-of-function studies to activate these factors in vitro. Using gene expression and
electrophysiology analyses, we will then identify optimal combinations to enhance maturation. If successful,
these studies will solve the greatest barrier to stem cell-based heart regeneration and bring us much closer to
clinical trials."

The candidate for this NCI Career Development Award is Max Jan, MD, PhD, who has completed clinical training
in molecular genetic pathology and is a current postdoctoral researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH). Dr. Jan has joined the laboratory of Benjamin Ebert, a worldwide leader in the study of hematologic
malignancies and targeted protein degradation as a therapeutic concept in cancer. Dr. Jan is co-mentored by
Marcela Maus, a worldwide leader in the field of cellular immunotherapy. An immediate-term goal for the
candidate is to complete his proposed scientific Aims, which center around reprogramming the epigenome of
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in order to increase their anti-tumor activity. The proposed work will
address a fundamental limitation of immune cell therapies for cancer, that cancers are too often able to evade
such therapies by inducing immune cell dysregulation and suppression. The candidate will develop methods to
reprogram the CAR T cell epigenome to enhance persistence and anti-tumor activity (Aim 1). A chemical biology
approach will then be used to switch between baseline and reprogrammed epigenetic states, in order to study
the immediate and direct mechanisms governing this process (Aim 2). Finally, the impact of regulated, switchable
epigenomic reprogramming on long-term CAR T cell effector functions will be tested (Aim 3). The completion of
these aims will intellectually and technically prepare Dr. Jan to transition to independence. The candidate’s short-
and long-term goals are directly relevant to the mission of the NCI, and pursue scientific knowledge in order to
more successfully treat patients with cancer using immune cell therapies. In the long term, the candidate will
continue to study patient responses to immune therapy in order to engineer next generations of safer and more
effective cellular immunotherapies for patients with solid and blood cancers. The candidate has advanced a
mentored career development plan centered on technical training in single cell genomics and epigenetics, as
well as academic and leadership skills. The candidate has outstanding institutional and departmental support at

tRNA-derived RNA Fragments (tRFs), a newly discovered family of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), are emerging
as essential disease biomarkers and regulators. Our recent publication demonstrated that tRFs are the most
impacted small ncRNAs (sncRNAs) by Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the hippocampus. The changes are mainly
from five tRFs, with one proven to correlate with the disease severity of AD experimentally. The correlation
between an AD-impacted tRF and AD severity was also present in serum samples , supporting tRFs as promising
AD indicators and potential prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers. Herein, we propose exploring a combination of an
unbiased discovery method and a newly developed biomedical quantification approach to investigate whether
the expression level of tRFs in the peripheral serum reflects the onset and progress of AD. During the discovery
R61 phase, we will determine the clinical reliability of serum biomarkers to differentiate AD subjects from healthy
individuals or individuals with non-AD dementia or non-dementia neurodegenerative diseases (Aim 1). We will
then determine the lead tRF signatures or signature compositions and investigate the correlation between their
changes with AD severity (Aim 2). The studies of the R61 phase will be mainly cross-sectional. During the R33
phase, we will investigate whether the AD biomarkers and their quantification assay can distinguish AD from its
early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We will determine biomarker changes in disease progression in
patients between baseline and subsequent follow-up patient visits. The patients who are healthy or have stable
MCI over the years will be used as controls. The culmination of these aims will benefit both prognosis and
diagnosis of AD. The feasibility of this approach is established by sample availability and our extensive research
experience in tRFs and clinical service experience in AD. The overall goal of our research is to discover AD
molecular biomarkers that could improve AD prevention and diagnosis and monitor the therapeutic efficacy in
the future."

Despite that the US spends much more on healthcare than other high-income countries, the health and
life expectancy of US working-age adults has declined, losing ground further to their peers in other
countries. Identifying those most at risk for worsening health and determining the key factors
contributing to the widening health disparities in the US population is critically important and timely. The
overarching goal of this project is to clarify the multi-level factors in determining US midlife health,
focusing on disability and cognitive functioning outcomes.
We will first focus on within-US comparison determining the role of place-specific contextual factors in
disability and cognitive functioning among working-age adults in the US. We will use a quasi-
experimental approach to enhance detecting marginal effects attributable to place-level vs. individual-
level factors; we compare adults with similar individual-level characteristics and resources but living in
areas with different place-level contexts. We will examine contextual factors of multi-level geographic
units such as tract-level social vulnerability and built environment, county-level social programs and
resources, and state-level social protection and healthcare policy. We will also capitalize on life-history
data that provide residential histories over the entire life course to help understate the level of exposure
and differential effect by life stage.
We will then identify factors contributing to the relative position of US midlife disability and cognitive
functioning compared to other high-income European countries. We will use harmonized survey data
from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and Survey
of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We will assess the extent to which national-level
economic inequality, healthcare system, and social protection policies affected the relative position of
the US among low- vs. high-SES adults. We will then examine the extent to which local-area factors
contribute to the difference in the outcomes across countries by leveraging and extending the study
team’s novel procedure to harmonize local-area contextual data across countries and link the
contextual data to each survey.
This study will contribute to clarifying socioeconomic, physical, and institutional factors for geographic
variation in midlife health by intersecting multi-level contextual factors with individual-level
socioeconomic characteristics. The project will also advance data for the comparative assessment in
cross-country health disparity by generating the local-area data harmonized across high-income
countries, which will be released in full compliance with confidential data protection policies.

Fibroblasts are the final effector cells of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive lung disease
characterized by excessive extracellular matrix production and parenchymal scarring. Compared to those from
non-fibrotic lung, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (collectively termed mesenchymal cells) from the lungs of IPF
patients possess an altered phenotype that is felt to promote and worsen lung fibrosis. This “pro-fibrotic”
phenotype is partly attributed to the altered expression of many genes, but the mechanisms that regulate these
genes are not completely known. Recent studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal cells are also
heterogeneous in their gene expression profiles. Alterations in DNA methylation is one epigenetic mechanism
that we and others have shown accounts for some of the differences between IPF and normal lung
mesenchymal cells, but global methylomic analysis has been limited and the potential heterogeneity in their
methylomic profiles has never been characterized. Further, the mechanisms that regulate the DNA methylome,
especially in the context of lung fibrosis, are not well understood and remain fundamental gaps in knowledge.
The objectives of this grant are to assess the heterogeneity of DNA methylomic profiles of mesenchymal cells
in the IPF lung, determine how they contribute to varying gene expression, and identify factors that regulate
and modulate DNA methylation in these cells. We will achieve this by comprehensively defining at the single-
cell level the DNA methylome of IPF mesenchymal cells, determine its relationship to chromatin conformation
and gene expression, and identify how microenvironmental conditions such as stiffness and matrix affect
methylation through the actions of DNA methyltansferases (DNMTs), ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes,
which are responsible for “de-“methylation, and UHRF1, a master regulator of DNA methylation. Our central
hypothesis is that IPF mesenchymal cells demonstrate heterogeneous patterns of DNA methylation that play a
significant role in contributing to heterogeneity in gene expression; these DNA methylomic patterns are shaped
by the actions of DNMTs, TETs, and UHRF1. We will test this hypothesis with three Specific Aims: 1) Assess
DNA methylomic heterogeneity in IPF mesenchymal cells and its relationship with chromatin conformation and
gene expression. We will do this by performing for the first time single-cell whole genome bisulfite sequencing
and laser capture microdissection. 2) Determine how DNA methylation in mesenchymal cells is affected by
TGF-β1, stiffness and ECM, with the hypothesis that it does so through upregulation of DNMT1, 3a, and TET2.
3) Determine how UHRF1 and its interaction with histone methylation helps establish specific patterns of DNA
methylation in mesenchymal cells. Completion of these aims will gain insights into the mechanisms that
regulate DNA methylation and by using an epigenetic lens, allow us to dissect the factors that contribute
mesenchymal cell heterogeneity in IPF lung. Ultimately, these studies will advance our understanding of how
alterations in DNA methylation contribute to IPF pathogenesis and serve as a means of targeted therapy."

Alzheimer’s disease is a leading cause of functional disability among older adults worldwide. Despite the
inevitability of functional impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, large heterogeneity in the rate and order that specific
functions are lost suggests that there are undiscovered ways to slow the progression of functional decline. The
majority of older adults are married or co-habiting with an intimate partner, and have daily routines that are
interdependent (i.e. synchronous activities or complementary division of functions such as shopping and
cooking). Despite strong evidence that interdependence in functioning exists in other older adult couples, there
is very little dyadic research on functional decline in the context of preclinical or clinical Alzheimer’s disease.
Longitudinal studies have established that the continuum of dementia-related functional decline begins years
prior to diagnosis and at wide range of impairment in cognition for most functions. Other previous studies have
demonstrated that frequency of engagement in daily activities begins to decline prior to loss of functional abilities.
The overall goal of the “RSELVES Study: Remote Sensing of (older adult couples’) Engagement in Life and
Variability in Everyday Support” is to examine the intra-dyadic patterns and change in daily life engagement and
functional interdependence along cognitive and well-being trajectories in older adult couples at high-risk of
developing Alzheimer’s disease. We will use an innovative digital data technology platform developed by the
Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, and a dyadic approach informed by the Developmental-Contextual
Model of Couple Synchrony to discover changes in life engagement and function in 100 older adult couples. The
aims of this study are to characterize baseline interdependence in patterns of life engagement and function
among couples with a partner who is at high risk for dementia (Aim 1); evaluate longitudinal dyadic change in
life engagement (e.g. dyadic disengagement or partner compensation) and support (Aim 2); and determine the
extent to which dyadic life engagement and support appraisals mitigate the influence of cognitive impairment on
functional impairment and well-being in older adult couples (Aim 3). Reframing AD-related functional decline in
couples as an interdependent process and measuring the degree of synchrony in activities digitally will uncover
the early dynamics of changes in life engagement among older adult couples and highlight novel opportunities
to target couples’ daily routines in order to delay the “cascade of losses” leading to functional dependence in
persons living with AD and degradations to well-being."

 Gene discovery has revolutionized medical genetics, but gaps remain in the understanding of complex disorders
in minority populations, in particular “admixed” groups of mixed ancestry. Admixed populations are systematically
excluded from genomic studies due largely to the lack of analytic approaches that can account for their genomic
diversity. Admixed populations, including African American and Latinx individuals, make up more than a third of the
U.S. populace and have higher rates of some common complex disorders including cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
some cancers, and PTSD – disorders which rank amongst the top global contributors to years lived with disability.
Yet, these groups face severe disparities in health research and treatment due to being so sorely underrepresented
in genomics. To reap full and equitable benefits from existing and ongoing efforts including All of Us, there is an unmet
need for the development of tools permitting the study of complex traits in admixed peoples.
 Dr. Atkinson proposes to address this pressing issue by developing a suite of innovative statistical methods,
software packages, and analytical resources that will make genomics more inclusive. In this 5-year R01 award, she
will: 1a) build a novel statistical method to allow for the integration of admixed individuals into rare variant association
studies; 1b) test this new method in a scalable cloud-based software implementation across phenotypes of varying
genetic architectures in the All of Us Research Program; and 1c) leverage the linkage disequilibrium in admixed
individuals to improve fine-mapping of top loci. We will also develop novel software tools to 2a) realistically simulate
diverse cohorts; which we will use to 2b) define best practice recommendations for multi-ancestry phasing, imputation,
and local ancestry inference; and 2c) assess the impact of common analytic strategies for diverse collections on gene
discovery outcomes. Finally, we will leverage admixture to 3a) extend our ancestry-informed frameworks to quantify
gene-gene interactions both locally and distally; and 3b) characterize trends in allelic effect size differences across
ancestry components with control over the environment. These efforts fill a major gap in existing resources and
remove barriers to the inclusion of underrepresented populations in medical genomics. This work is in direct line with
the strategic missions of the NIH/NHGRI to focus on inclusion and diversity, highlighting the crucial and timely nature
of the proposed project."

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Although the pathophysiology of HF is complex and
remains incompletely understood, defects in mitochondrial function have been implicated in the progression and
outcomes of HF, and emerged as an important target for HF therapy. One well-known contributing factor to
adverse cardiac remodeling in the failing hearts is excess mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species
(mtROS). Accordingly, a variety of antioxidant-based therapies have been developed for HF treatment over the
last decades. However, despite promising outcomes in preclinical studies, translation of these therapies to the
clinic has not succeeded to date, suggesting that alternative or complementary mitochondrial therapeutic targets
are needed. In addition to excess mtROS, profound loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (m) is another
key hallmark of HF. In the cardiomyocyte (CM), m disruption affects not only energy production, but also a
variety of signaling pathways crucial for cell function and survival, such as redox balance, calcium homeostasis
and mitochondrial quality control. We hypothesize that synergistically targeting mitochondria, i.e., concurrently
preserving mitochondrial m and scavenging excess mtROS, is a viable therapeutic strategy for HF treatment.
However, assessing the therapeutic potential of m preservation is challenging, due to a lack of tools for
dynamic and specific control of CM m in live animals. To overcome this technical barrier, we developed an
innovative mitochondrial-targeted luminoptogenetic (named mLumOpto) technology by integrating luciferase-
luciferin-emitted endogenous bioluminescence with the mitochondrial optogenetics we recently published. Our
preliminary data indicate that mLumOpto can induce dynamic CM m control in the absence of external light
illumination. The primary goal of this project is to employ this advanced mLumOpto technology to manipulate
CM m in vivo to evaluate the efficacy of CM m preservation alone, or in synergism with a mtROS scavenger
(i.e., mitochondrial-specific antioxidant), in HF treatment in preclinical mouse models. The translational potential
of the proposed synergistic mitochondrial-targeted HF therapy will also be assessed in human-like large animals
(i.e., pigs). Three Specific Aims are proposed to accomplish our objectives. Aim 1 will determine the role of
sustained CM m depolarization in pathological cardiac remodeling and HF development in mice, and dissect
the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aim 2 will evaluate the efficacy of synergistic m preservation and
mtROS scavenging in improving adverse cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction in two well-established
mouse HF models (i.e., pressure overload and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion). Aim 3 will assess the
translational potential of mLumOpto-mediated HF therapy in pigs. Successful completion of this project will lead
to not only an innovative technology capable of specifically and dynamically manipulating CM mitochondria in
vivo, but also a novel translational mitochondrial-targeted therapy for HF treatment."

Youth onset type 2 diabetes (YOT2D) is increasing in prevalence by approximately 5% per year, and
disproportionately impacts youth from many minority race/ethnic groups. YOT2D is a rapidly progressive
disease in young adults leading to many life-long health complications resulting in increased morbidity and
mortality. Research shows a key marker in the progression of YOT2D is failure of the β cells. To date,
identifying predictors of β cell failure and thus the progression to YOT2D have not been elucidated making
early intervention and prevention impossible. The goal of the present proposal, Identifying Metabolic and
Psychosocial Antecedents and Characteristics of youth-onset Type 2 diabetes (IMPACT DM), is to develop a
comprehensive prediction model that will identify youth at the highest risk of developing YOT2D setting the
stage to implement prevention strategies preserving β cell function. The overarching hypothesis is that a
combination of physiologic and psychosocial factors, specifically puberty, in utero exposures, and psychosocial
stresses, are major drivers of the development of YOT2D. The cohort will include those at the highest risk of
developing YOT2D in order to deeply phenotype them physically, metabolically, and psychosocially all in an
effort to develop a comprehensive prediction model. Aim 1 will examine glucose homeostasis and changes in
glycemia over time using conventional OGTT methods as well as free-living continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM). These measures will then be used to examine their relationship to β cell function which is the driver of
diabetes progression identifying key glycemic features that predict YOT2D. Aim 2 will identify physiologic and
psychosocial variables such as hormones, cardiometabolic health, energy expenditure, adverse childhood
events (ACEs), and in utero exposures that predict β cell function and thus YOT2D. Additional novel predictors
of YOT2D will be examined in Aim 3, specifically focusing on metabolomic profiles, microbiome, and circulating
miRNA. Using these novel variables as well as the glycemic, physiologic, and psychosocial variables identified
in the previous aims, a comprehensive model to predict YOT2D will be developed. The University of Oklahoma
Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) is exceptionally well-suited for this study because of the population served
(8th in the nation for the highest rates of childhood obesity and substantial Hispanic and Native American
populations), and established partnerships. In the TODAY trial, the Oklahoma clinical center recruited and
retained more participants than any of the other 14 study sites. Overall this proposal will lead to the
identification of metabolic and psychosocial antecedents and characteristics that predict the clinical
progression of YOT2D. Also, it would identify factors impacting β cell function leading to the development
interventions to prevent YOT2D through maintaining β cell function, resulting in the reduction of microvascular
complications during childhood and young adulthood."

Immunotherapy induces durable remissions in a subset of patients with highly mutated cancers. However,
most cancers are modestly mutated and fail to respond to current immunotherapy treatments. This is
especially true for malignancies caused by activating mutations in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic
subunit alpha (PIK3CA), the most commonly mutated driver oncogene in humans. Mutant PIK3CA cancers
exhibit resistance to conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and antibodies.
Innovative new approaches that bring the curative potential of immunotherapy to PIK3CA mutated cancers are
therefore urgently needed. We and others previously performed detailed immune monitoring studies of
exceptional patient responders to resolve the mechanisms of successful immunotherapy. These analyses
revealed that T cells from responders often recognize neoantigens (NeoAgs) - peptides derived from the
protein products of somatic mutations presented by a patient’s unique complement of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) molecules. In >99% of cases, NeoAgs are exclusive to an individual patient because they result from
passenger mutations that do not contribute to cancer cell fitness and therefore are subject to clonal
heterogeneity. NeoAg clonal heterogeneity has emerged as a major cause of immunotherapy resistance. We
hypothesize that clonally expressed NeoAgs derived from hotspot mutations in mutant PIK3CA can be
immunogenic and are amenable to therapeutic targeting using T cell receptors (TCRs). In support of our
hypothesis, we discovered through a mass spectrometry (MS) screen that a shared NeoAg derived from
mutant PIK3CA is naturally processed and presented in the context of a prevalent HLA allele. We have termed
this unique subset of antigens “public” NeoAgs because they are cancer-specific yet expressed by groups of
patients, enabling the use of off-the-shelf reagents. Using a novel TCR discovery platform, we successfully
generated multiple T cell clones specific for this PIK3CA public NeoAg, retrieved their unique TCR gene
sequences, and exogenously transferred public NeoAg reactivity to non-specific T cells. These results confirm
the immunogenicity of MS-identified public NeoAgs and enable the development of TCR-based gene
therapies. Building on these preliminary data, we propose in Aim 1 to develop a novel therapeutic approach for
cancers expressing a PIK3CA public NeoAg using TCR gene transfer and adoptive immunotherapy. In Aim 2,
we will establish in cancer patients the frequency, immune-compartmentalization, and potential pathways of
resistance to T cells specific for a PIK3CA public NeoAg. In Aim 3, we will resolve the physical basis for
PIK3CA public NeoAg immunogenicity by studying the physical and structural properties of public NeoAg/HLA
molecules, their wild type counterparts, and the complexes they form with TCRs. Together, this work will
elucidate the fundamental principles governing NeoAg immunogenicity in humans, enabling innovative new
precision immune-genomic approaches for common epithelial cancers currently lacking curative treatments."

The Yale Diabetes Research Center (Yale DRC) was established in 1993 with the goal of promoting research
in diabetes and related metabolic disorders at Yale. The Yale DRC brings together a multidisciplinary group of
97 members and professional supporting staff, new investigators and research trainees from 29 departments or
divisions from 5 colleges or schools at Yale University The scope of the research activities of the membership is
very broad, ranging from basic molecular biology to whole body physiology and the treatment of diabetic patients.
The members, however, share a common interest in research that is related to diabetes and disorders of

strategies. The design of the Yale DRC is aimed at developing an infrastructure that could serve as a catalyst to
stimulate innovative diabetes and metabolic-related research. The fulfill this goal, the overall objectives are to
create the intellectual environment and resources at Yale that will lead to innovative research programs in
science laboratories and with human participants. To build the research base, we aim to encourage participation
in diabetes research by new investigators or established investigators with novel ideas and technologies to
further the mission. In addition, training the next generation of investigators is a prime objective and to give them
the opportunity to develop and test their ideas in a supportive environment. The cornerstone of the Yale DRC is
its five Research Cores that provide funded basic and clinical investigators with the opportunity to more efficiently
utilize resources and expand the scope of their research programs. The Clinical Metabolism and the Diabetes
Translational Research Cores facilitate metabolic research in patients, whereas the Molecular Genetics
Mouse Core, Physiology and Cell Biology Cores, that comprise the more basic science focus of the Yale

Based on its strategic location, the tectorial membrane (TM) has long been thought to play an essential role in
hearing, but the important cochlear mechanisms remain unclear. We propose research to improve our understanding
of the functional role of the TM in determining (1) the remarkable properties of normal hearing — including its
exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity — as well as (2) the hearing loss associated with genetic mutations
of the TM and other cochlear pathologies. Conventional models of cochlear mechanics represent the TM as a
viscoelastic solid, and while the importance of both viscosity and elasticity is well established, these models do not
account for the central role of water in this tissue. The TM is a gel: 97% water contained in a macromolecular matrix
of proteins and sugar groups. Recent studies show that sound-induced motions of water through this macromolecular
matrix plays a critical functional role in determining the timing of mechanical responses – and this timing is central
to determining the frequency selectivity that is a hallmark of mammalian hearing.
The proposed research will measure and characterize the important consequences of the gelatinous nature of the
TM, i.e., its poroelastic properties. This work is organized in two related aims. The ﬁrst investigates mechanical
consequences of poroelasticity. We have developed a technique based on atomic force microscopy to measure
mechanical properties of the TM at the level of single hair bundles. We will apply this technique to characterize
poroelasticity in TMs from normal-hearing rodents, as well as mice with genetic disorders of hearing. Our second
aim focuses on the role of ions (especially calcium) that are dissolved in the liquid phase of the TM. The TM has
been shown to concentrate calcium at levels well in excess of those in the surrounding endolymph. Changes in ionic
concentrations have been shown to alter the electro-mechanical properties of the TM, and will thereby also aﬀect
the closely apposed hair bundles of hair cells. The local concentration of calcium is known to aﬀect not only
the sound-induced receptor potentials of hair cells, but also adaptation processes that are necessary to maintain the
remarkable sensitivity of hearing.
Results from these studies will increase our understanding of the cochlear mechanisms that underlie both normal and
impaired hearing. This knowledge has important practical applications for the delineation of inner-ear disorders (and
concomitant suggestions for treatment) and for the design of speech-processing devices such as cochlear implants,
hearing aids, and speech-recognition systems."

 All movements involve dynamic interactions between passive elastic structures and muscle
contractile elements, but our understanding of the consequences of this interaction for both
normal and pathological muscle function is limited. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanical
influence of elastic elements on muscle force production and gait. This project aims to understand
how the mechanical interaction between internal muscle elastic elements, fluid pressure, and
contractile elements define muscle force, speed and power output. Previous work shows that this
interaction is highly three-dimensional and significantly influences muscle performance. A
dominant paradigm of muscle force production as a one-dimensional process determined
primarily by contractile element properties has limited our understanding. The project aims to use
a combination of modeling and experiment to test novel hypotheses about how multi-scale, three-
dimensional interactions influence muscle mechanical output. A combination of direct
measurement of contractile behavior of muscles in different animal systems and physical models
is used to test mechanistic hypotheses about how structures at multiple scales interact to
influence mechanical output. The specific aims of the project are: 1) to test the hypothesis that
fluid forces contribute to muscle force output, 2) to determine whether stiffened connective tissue
in older muscle reduces force and work output, 3) to test the hypothesis that muscle fluid volume
influences passive muscle stiffness, and 4) to test the hypothesis that dynamic changes in muscle
architecture provide a mechanism for intramuscular elastic energy storage and recovery.
 In most cases the mechanistic link between structural pathologies in muscle and functional
deficits is poorly developed. We will test novel hypothesized mechanisms for how changes in
extracellular matrix and muscle fluid content can alter muscle mechanical output with the aim of
determining structure-function relationships that may underpin functional deficits in a range of
conditions, including dystrophies, cerebral palsy, aging, and secondary to stroke and spinal cord

muscle-tendon function. An improved understanding of how muscle elastic elements influence
the mechanical behavior of healthy muscle-tendon units may also aid in the design of prosthetic

10875471,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY; e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and nonbinary people <18
years) experience substantial inequities in alcohol use, thus placing SGMY at greater risk for alcohol-related
morbidity and mortality across the life-course. Despite making great strides in identifying determinants (e.g.,
minority stress and discrimination) of these inequities over the last 25 years, evidence-based interventions for
reducing SGMY alcohol use are lacking. Our primary objective for this application is to rigorously test the
efficacy of Singularities, a theory-based, SGMY-informed, game-based intervention for preventing and
reducing SGMY binge drinking. This game was developed and pilot tested in our previous grant
(R21HD083561; PI: Egan), which showed that the game was highly acceptable to SGMY and had preliminary
efficacy for reducing SGMY’s binge drinking frequency. Our proposed fully-powered efficacy trial is the next
step to confirm the public health impacts of our game-based intervention. In Aim 1a, we will conduct a
randomized controlled trial to test the short-term, mid-term, and long-term efficacy of a game-based
intervention for preventing and reducing binge drinking among SGMY (n=2,298). We hypothesize that at 3, 6,
and 12 months after intervention delivery, SGMY in the game-based intervention arm vs. control arm will have
greater reductions in binge drinking (primary outcome) and other health risk behaviors (secondary outcomes).
In Aim 1b, we will explore the feasibility of intervention uptake and engagement in a non-randomized non-
incentivized SGMY subsample (n=60) to elucidate intervention implementation under real world conditions. In
Aim 2, we will quantitatively explore if RCT participants’ baseline minority stressors (across multiple distal and
proximal domains) and demographics (e.g., race/ethnicity) interact with the intervention to predict changes in
binge drinking and other outcomes (i.e., how intervention efficacy differs by subgroups). In Aim 3, we will
qualitatively explore (via post-RCT interviews) the interplay between intervention participants’ binge drinking,
minority stressors, and their use of game-based skills. Upon successful completion of this research, the
expected outcome is to have an evidence-based intervention for significantly reducing SGMY binge drinking.
Further, our study will provide mixed methods results identifying how minority stress and demographics
moderate the efficacy of our evidence-based intervention, which will inform the field about for whom SGMY-
affirmative interventions are most beneficial and illuminate for whom additional interventions are needed.
These results will have positive impacts because our intervention has potential to be widely scaled via online
dissemination and can help federal agencies meet their goals (e.g., Healthy People 2030) of reducing
population-level SGMY inequities in alcohol use."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American
women. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15% to 20% of all BC cases and has the worst
prognosis and overall survival. Although many targeted agents are ongoing clinical trials, none have significantly
improved the survival in TNBC patients. Thus, the identification of novel targets and effective strategies, including
combination therapies, are urgent needed for TNBC patients. PRMT5 is emerging as a potential therapeutic
target. Several PRMT5 inhibitors have been developed and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials,
including a phase II trial for early-stage BC. Compared to other BC subtypes, TNBC displays the strongest
PRMT5 expression. High PRMT5 expression is positively correlated with poorer survival rate in TNBC patients.
Despite its association with TNBC progression, PRMT5 regulation and the molecular mechanisms by which
PRMT5 promotes TNBC remain elusive. Moreover, TNBC cell lines display differential sensitivity or resistance
to PRMT5 inhibitors, but the mechanisms have yet to be defined. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that: (1)
PRMT5 is ubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, which is important for its activation and TNBC cell
proliferation; (2) PRMT5 suppresses autophagy induction and catalyzes ULK1 arginine methylation; and (3)
autophagy inhibition sensitizes TNBC cells to PRMT5 inhibitor. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose
three aims to test our central hypothesis that TRAF6, PRMT5, and ULK1 form a novel axis to regulate autophagy
and TNBC progression, and combination of PRMT5 and autophagy inhibitors is a potential strategy to combat
TNBC. To validate our hypothesis, we propose three Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanism through which
TRAF6 regulates PRMT5 activation. In Aim 2, we will define the molecular function of PRMT5 in autophagy
regulation by methylating ULK1. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the synergistic effect of PRMT5 and autophagy
inhibitors in TNBC. We believe that our proposed studies will not only substantially advance current
understanding of regulatory mechanism and biological function of PRMT5, but also provide a rationale for
combination of PRMT5 and autophagy inhibitors to treat TNBC."
10740872,"A new immune checkpoint pathway in human bladder cancer
This proposal is in response to the PAR-19-183 (Biology of Bladder Cancer).
Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States.
The survival rate of bladder cancer has been largely unchanged for the last 30
years. Very recently PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were approved by FDA for the
treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer, but worked in only a subset
of ~15-25% of patients. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new and
effective treatment for bladder cancer. Developing novel checkpoint inhibitors,
especially inhibitors that target outside the PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, is
a promising strategy and may potentially have high impact in clinical
management of human bladder cancer. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is
that KIR3DL3-HHLA2 is a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive pathway
as well as a novel therapeutic target in human bladder cancer. Guided by our
published clinical and basic research and our strong preliminary data, we will
pursue following specific aims: 1) Investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of HHLA2 expression in human bladder cancer and APCs; 2)
Dissect co-inhibitory function and signaling of the KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway; and
3) Develop new immunotherapies against human bladder cancer by targeting the
KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway. This proposal comprises an integrated network of
multi-disciplinary collaborative investigators (immunologists, urologists,
oncologists, and bioinformaticians) to accelerate translational research and
maximize future clinical benefits. The outcomes of this project will reveal new
fundamental biology of human bladder cancer and will guide the rational
development of new immunotherapies for the treatment of human bladder
cancer."
10802300,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs at a high rate in both native kidneys and allografts and has no specific therapy
available. Prior studies have established T cell activation and trafficking as an important mechanism that
modulate ischemia reperfusion (IR) and nephrotoxic AKI, along with other overlapping immune and non-
immune mechanisms. Furthermore, AKI is common in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD1) for
multiple cancers. Our preliminary data using RNA sequencing and flow cytometry shows significant expression
of novel immune checkpoint molecule, T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) in T cells from
post IR mouse kidney and ischemic human kidney. Recently published data suggest that TIGIT co-inhibitory
activity modifies Th1 and Th17 responses, plus regulates Treg suppression activity. Our preliminary data shows
that TIGIT expressing T cells in mouse kidney are highly activated and produce proinflammatory cytokines after
IR. Importantly, mice lacking TIGIT (TIGIT KO) were protected from AKI in IR and Cisplatin AKI models,
suggesting detrimental role for TIGIT during AKI. Therefore, understanding TIGIT-mediated inflammatory
response during AKI is critical for developing novel AKI therapy and to mitigate kidney adverse effects of
immune checkpoint therapies. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TIGIT promotes proinflammatory
functions of kidney T cells and impairs Treg suppression function. To test this hypothesis, we will (Aim 1)
investigate phenotypic, functional and transcriptional effects of TIGIT in mouse kidney T cells using in vitro and
in vivo approaches. We will further investigate the functional relationship between TIGIT and its co-signaling
partners (CD226, CD155) and other co-inhibitory molecules (PD1, CTLA4) in regulating kidney T cell functions
at baseline and during AKI. Additionally (Aim 2), we will test the hypothesis that T cell specific TIGIT activity is
the major mechanism that drives AKI and impairs repair process using adoptive transfer approaches, in vivo
anti-TIGIT agonist/antagonist antibody effects on AKI outcome in WT and TIGIT KO mice and blocking TIGIT
signaling in repair phase after established AKI. Finally (Aim 3), we will investigate functional effects of TIGIT
expression in human kidney T cells in patients with renal cell carcinoma and live donor biopsies. We will also
evaluate TIGIT expression on T cells isolated from ischemic deceased donor kidney samples and
transcriptional effects at single cell level in T cells from live donor kidney. Results from these studies will be the
first to provide important information on TIGIT mediated effect in kidney T cell functions, therapeutic potential of
targeting TIGIT for AKI treatment and set the stage for future pre-clinical and clinical studies."

This proposal aims to develop, evaluate and disseminate novel statistical tools for rigorous investigation of the
clinical spectrum, biological underpinnings and social determinants of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COronoVIrus Disease (COVID-19), and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-
CoV-2 infection (PASC). Given the enormous scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential severity of PASC,
the complexity of available and anticipated data streams, and the paucity of biological and clinical knowledge,
there is an urgent need for novel and robust statistical methods to address the most pressing PASC related
research questions. Advanced statistical methods for observational data can be leveraged to address many of
these questions; however, the identification, rigorous application and advancement of apropos methods requires
sophisticated understanding of both the clinical context and the nuanced capabilities of available methods. To
this end, we propose statistical innovations and novel translation of existing methods to significantly advance
PASC clinical research, bringing together a team of physician-scientists and biostatisticians who are deeply
embedded in COVID-19 clinical research to achieve the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and evaluate a
causal mediation analysis framework for investigating the mechanistic pathways from SARS-CoV-2 infection to
PASC and PASC recovery, including methods to accommodate time-varying and unevenly spaced mediators
and time-to-event outcomes; Aim 2: Apply, evaluate, and extend marginal structural models as a framework to
assess the impact of interventions on likelihood of PASC associated severe outcomes, in the context of time-
varying confounding, competing and semi-competing risks, interval censoring and unobserved disease
subtypes; Aim 3: Develop and apply methods for positive unlabeled data, using an expectation-maximization
approach that leverages measured covariates and information on patient-level outcomes. The proposed
methods will be applied using local and national emerging observational and EHR data resource. These
statistical innovations will transform our understanding of the clinical course of PASC as we lead rigorous
application to several leading-edge data resources."
10766224,"Project Summary/Abstract
Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied across all life sciences to construct predictive models. However, it
relies on the assumption that training samples are independent and identically distributed. This is frequently
violated in the life sciences, where data is “grouped” by measurements from the same sample (patient, cell,
tissue), by the same observer, or at the same site. This leads to clusters of correlated data (random effects), and
when the models are fit to such data, the model parameters can be severely biased, leading to type I and II
errors. Proper accounting for such dependencies in DL models has gone unsolved. The objective of this proposal
is to develop the appropriate DL modifications to separately model global fixed effects and random effects that
increase model interpretability and performance for precise unbiased predictions related to human disease.
 Our proposal is based on a novel, model-agnostic framework to transform conventional DL models into proper
mixed effects DL (MEDL) models. This affords capabilities of statistical linear mixed effects models, including
the separation of cluster-invariant fixed effects from cluster-specific random effects, while preserving the ability
of DL to learn data-driven nonlinear associations. The core premise is that proper MEDL models 1) are more
resilient to confounding effects and more attentive to true predictive features, 2) can capture, quantify, and
visualize random effects to enhance interpretability, and 3) attain better generalization to new clusters. We
propose to incorporate MEDL into three of the most important DL model types including dense feed-forward
neural networks (DFNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and autoencoders. Our preliminary results
demonstrate multiple advantages of MEDL over conventional DL in both accuracy and interpretability. MEDL
outperforms previous clustered data approaches including: domain adversarial models, meta-learning, and the
inclusion of cluster membership as an input covariate. We developed an ME-DFNN to predict conversion from
mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) from tabular data, an ME-CNN to diagnose AD from MRI,
and an ME-autoencoder to compress and classify live cell images. Across these test cases, MEDL models were
the most discriminative between known confounded and real features; they were able to quantify or visualize the
random effects and outperformed other models on clusters both seen and unseen during training. This proposal
further develops the methods to handle complex architectures and hierarchical effects, with external validation,
through these aims: 1) Develop ME-DFNNs for classification and regression. 2) Develop 3D ME-CNNs and multi-
modal 3D ME-CNNs for medical image classification. 3) Develop convolutional and vector ME-autoencoders for
image and omics data. We describe the innovative incorporation of an adversarial classifier to constrain the base
model to learn fixed effects, a Bayesian random effects subnetwork, and an approach to apply random effects
to unseen clusters. All these solutions will be released as open source software that improve existing DL models
to ultimately support precision biomedicine for the study and treatment of human disease."
10758617,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Stuttering is a speech fluency disorder that negatively impacts the communicative abilities of 5–8% of children
and 1% of adults. Stuttering also limits the individual’s academic-occupational achievement and social-
psychological wellbeing. Unfortunately, existing stuttering treatments are associated with considerable individual
variation in their outcomes, and in some cases, are entirely ineffective. Additionally, existing treatments require
many sessions, and some are susceptible to as much as 70% relapse, leading to costly solutions with limited
accessibility, especially for individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A major barrier to developing
effective stuttering treatments is our incomplete understanding of the specific neural processes underlying the
behavioral aspects of stuttering. There is a critical need to (1) identify the deficient neural processes underlying
stuttering, (2) determine their functional contributions to breakdowns in speech fluency, and (3) develop neural
and behavioral interventions that specifically target the deficient processes, and thus, promote fluency in
individuals who stutter. Current speech theories posit that as the brain prepares speech movements, it uses its
predictions to prepare the sensory systems for more efficient and accurate speech monitoring. These predictive
sensorimotor processes and their interplay with error-detection processes are critical for fluent speech
production. This project’s overall objective is to elucidate the role of predictive sensorimotor processes in the
breakdowns of speech fluency in children and adults who stutter. We will address this question using behavioral
and neurophysiological recordings combined with neurostimulation techniques. Our central hypothesis is that
stuttering is associated with deficits in predictive sensorimotor processes, leading to inaccurate predictions. Aim
1 will evaluate the effects of exposure to auditory errors on predictive sensorimotor processes of individuals who
stutter across the lifespan. Aim 2 will characterize the temporal alignment of prediction and auditory feedback by
delaying auditory feedback or speech initiation. Aim 3 will determine the functional contributions of the speech
premotor cortex in predictive sensorimotor processes. Overall, the expected outcome of this mechanistic
research program is a detailed neuro-developmental account of deficits in predictive processes of stuttering
individuals across the lifespan. This project’s results will have a critical positive impact because (1) they will form
a robust scientific foundation for developing neural and behavioral interventions for stuttering, and (2) they will
have significant implications for theories of stuttering and speech production."
10922669,"Abstract
During transcription of many cellular and viral mRNAs, RNA Polymerase II is inhibited by
negative elongation factors and requires the positive elongation factor, pTEFb, to release this
stalled state. The binding of the 7SK small nuclear RNA to the HEXIM adapter protein as a part
of the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP) complex normally keeps pTEFb
sequestered within the nucleus and this interaction must be overcome for productive
transcriptional elongation. The most well-studied example of the regulatory mechanisms that
underlie transcriptional elongation is the HIV Tat system. Briefly, in order to release the stalled
state of its transcript, HIV has evolved the viral Tat protein, which binds 7SK and displaces
HEXIM to hijack pTEFb. On the other hand, some cellular factors, like BRD4, achieve the same
outcome without displacing HEXIM. This proposal aims to gain a mechanistic understanding of
the structural state presented to all transcriptional regulators encountering an HEXIM-driven
inhibitory 7SK snRNP complex, and how capture of pTEFb is achieved by the specialized HIV
Tat transcriptional factor. The aims will be: (#1) to understand if the basic mechanisms are
maintained in HEXIM1 and 2 and if diverse positive transcriptional regulators capitalize on the
mechanism, (#2) to determine the structures of the individual RNA domains present in 7SK-
snRNA and (#3) to solve the structures of both HEXIM-bound and Tat-bound complexes."
10744229,"The guiding research strategy of the collaborative projects is to use pre-clinical models of disease that weaken
bone or delay fracture repair of high relevance to the VA population, employing in vivo/in vitro models to
identify ‘druggable’ mechanisms enabling the testing of promising therapies directed at those mechanisms, while
incorporating best methods and outcome measures utilizing the combined expertise of the group. Fractures,
and in particular delayed or non union of fractures, is a major cause of morbidity and lost productivity in our
Veterans. Better treatment is required. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) treatment shows promise in accelerating
fracture repair and closing non unions. Our previous studies demonstrated that IGF1 signaling is required for the
anabolic actions of PTH, and that the actions of IGF1 are in turn dependent on ephrinB2/EphB4 bidirectional
signaling. Abaloparatide is an analog of PTH that appears even more anabolic to bone than PTH. But how these
anabolic agents actually promote fracture repair is unclear, and the fracture repair process is itself complex. We
have focused on three sites at which fracture repair takes place within the callus in fractured long bones, each
with unique characteristics. 1) Intramembranous bone formation occurs on the periosteal surface of the fractured
cortex involving direct differentiation of periosteal osteoprogenitors to osteoblasts. 2) Endochondral bone
formation bridges the gap between the broken ends of bone involving differentiation of periosteal osteochondroal
progenitors into chondrocytes which then transdifferentiate into osteoblasts forming the bony callus. 3)
Intramedullary bone formation occurs within the marrow of the broken bone pieces initiated by a unique set of
osteocytes and potentially transcortical vessel perivascular cells expressing stem cell markers that move from
the cortex into the marrow to differentiate (dedifferentiate) into osteoblasts forming bone within the marrow. We
hypothesize that abaloparatide, acting on these different cells, all of which express the PTH/PTHrP receptor
through which abaloparatide acts, will promote the coordinated repair process via mechanisms that include IGF1
regulated ephrinB2/EphB4 coupling between the osteoprogenitors, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and perivascular
cells essential for fracture repair. We will use a variety of mechanical, molecular, and imaging means established
in our own laboratory and that of our collaborators in the collaborative VAMR proposal to examine the response
to abaloparatide at each of these sites. We will then test this response in mouse models in which the IGF1
receptor and ephrinB2 have been deleted from the cells involved with fracture repair to test the role of these
signaling mechanisms in the response to abaloparatide. Our project has three aims. Aim 1 will demonstrate
whether abaloparatide accelerates fracture repair via IGF1/ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling at each site of
regenerative bone formation by measuring the rate of bone formation using microcomputed tomography to
assess structure, Xray computed tomography to assess mineral composition, histomorphometry to evaluate
cellular changes, mRNA levels to assess genomic changes, and finite element analysis and cantilever bending
to evaluate the strength of the callus. Aim 2 will examine the contribution of intramedullary bone to fracture repair
and the role of osteocytes in its formation with the use cell depletion strategies. Aim 3 will use lineage tracing to
demonstrate the activation of osteochondral progenitors in the periosteum and cortical bone by abaloparatide
and the subsequent involvement of their progeny in bone formation at the different sites of repair. Aim 4 will
determine the molecular changes at each site during the repair process induced by abaloparatide using spatial
transcriptomics to evaluate the genomic changes occurring in the different site of fracture repair."

Genetically characterized rhesus macaques that are free of endemic viral pathogens have become the premier
animal model for HIV/AIDS research, including studies on HIV pathogenesis, AIDS-related opportunistic
infections, as well as the development of HIV treatments and vaccines. The establishment of specific
pathogen-free (SPF) colonies also serves to protect animal caretakers from zoonotic diseases and improves
overall animal health. However, the successful derivation and maintenance of SPF colonies is challenging and
requires strict surveillance regimens over long periods of time. Therefore, the overall aim of the Viral Testing

maintain our SPF colonies free of disease. To do this, we will use proven virus screening algorithms combined
with an expanding arsenal of screening assays. A central strategy to achieve this will be the implementation of
a new multiplexed protein microarray assay platform for routine colony screening, which we have developed

10789935,"PROJECT SUMMARY, Core C: MHC Genetic Typing Core
Genetically well-characterized animal models are critical for the success of S/HIV research, including
characterization for MHC genotype, known ancestry, and pedigree relationships. In particular, informative and
accurate MHC genotyping is essential, due to the complexity of the MHC class I loci in macaques, and the
influence of allele type on disease progression. The need for genetically well-characterized animal models for
research must also be balanced against the need to preserve genetic diversity in animal colonies dedicated to
supporting biomedical research. This is a requirement not only to ensure long-term colony health, but to ensure
the relevance of experimental findings to human disease. The ONPRC is a leader in the development of many of
the current recommended approaches and technologies used in genetic typing and management of NHP
colonies. Thus, the aims of the Genetics Core for this project are to, 1) use state-of-the-art genetic testing to
characterize all ONPRC Indian-origin rhesus macaques for MHC genotype, and 2) to maximize the genetic
diversity of the ONPRC breeding colony while producing sufficient numbers of MHC-genotyped Indian-origin
rhesus macaques to meet research needs. To achieve these aims, we will conduct MHC Class I genotyping of an
additional 1,760 SPF4 Indian-origin rhesus macaques to support continued research, and will additionally
develop new or improved approaches to the genetic management of these macaques. These innovations include
the use of cost-effective genome-wide sparse sequencing to assess pedigree relationships, genetic diversity, and
ancestry in a single, combined assay; the implementation of automated, periodic reporting aimed at summarizing
genetic diversity for every breeding group in the colony; and improved algorithms for estimating the genetic value
of individual animals by adding information on demographics, genotypes or phenotypes of interest, and animal
assignment history."

The intestinal microbiome is known to play an integral role in human nutrition and metabolism in adults, but
there remain large fundamental gaps in our understanding of the role of the microbiome in growth and
nutrition during infancy. Extremely preterm infants commonly experience poor growth and nutrient accretion
in the postnatal period, which is independently associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Prior
work from the applicant demonstrates that extremely preterm infants with poor postnatal growth have
differences in the development of the microbiome that persist throughout the NICU period and are associated
with altered host metabolism. Further, preliminary findings from the applicant’s K23 project demonstrate that
neonatal gnotobiotic mice colonized by intestinal microbial communities from extremely preterm infants with
poor postnatal growth have lower weight and length gain than neonatal mice colonized by microbial
communities from infants with appropriate postnatal growth trajectories, suggesting that the microbiome is
causally related to postnatal growth. This proposal will build upon the applicant’s current K23 research to
identify specific bacterial mediators of these effects and test their potential to increase postnatal weight and
length gain in gnotobiotic mice colonized from birth with the microbiomes of preterm infants with poor
postnatal growth. Together with the K23 work, the proposed experiments will provide a tractable model and
strong foundational data to support a competitive R01 application focused on understanding the mechanisms
of microbial influences on postnatal growth and development. Further, this work has potential to lead to
discovery of new microbiome-targeted approaches to support healthy growth and nutrition in preterm infants
during a critical developmental period."

10767953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic and acute inflammation are significant contributors to skeletal muscle pathology in multiple diseases.
Severe inflammation associated with sepsis has profound short- and long-term effects on muscle. Sepsis is
characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection that can alter muscle force generation, wasting,
and bioenergetics. Survivors of sepsis have increased risk for the development of persistent acquired weakness
syndromes. The inflammatory response in sepsis is mediated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). While we know that sepsis-induced
changes in skeletal muscle are associated with inflammation, the mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction in
sepsis are not well understood, and there is a significant need to capture the evolution of these impairments to
establish effective treatment strategies. Harnessing in vitro models of cytokine-induced myopathy in human
skeletal muscle can inform and elucidate fundamental mechanisms of pathology in sepsis enabling development
of effective treatments. Resistance training is a widely accepted prescriptive treatment for rebuilding muscle
strength and mass. However, post-recovery resistance training has minimal long-term effects in many sepsis
patients, and recent studies suggest that early (pre-recovery) physical therapy may preserve muscle fiber cross-
sectional area though not strength, indicating a need for further analysis of the complex evolution of sepsis. This
evidence formed the cornerstone of our hypothesis that inflammation limits the therapeutic effects of resistance
training, which will be tested in a 3D in vitro organoid model through the following specific aims: 1) Establish an
in vitro model of sepsis using human SMMT to capture temporal impairments in response to pro-inflammatory
agents; 2) Determine recovery of contractile function and structure of engineered SMMT in response to
resistance training following exposure to pro-inflammatory agents. The proposed technical innovation and study
is important because it will inform the fundamental basis of sepsis-induced myopathies and the potential role of
resistance training to ameliorate post-sepsis effects. These results will positively impact future treatment of
sepsis and improve the quality of life of post-sepsis survivors."
10757949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stroke affects 800,000 Americans every year and remains a leading cause of long-term disability. Increased
blood pressure variability (BPV) has consistently been associated with two to three times higher risk of disability
or mortality after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in retrospective analyses, independent of mean blood pressure.
Our central hypothesis is that increased BPV is harmful after AIS and warrants reduction. However, prior BPV
research in AIS patients has been retrospective and limited by non-standardized BP measurement and,
therefore, BPV is not mentioned in current stroke guidelines. To address the limitations of prior BPV research,
determine mechanisms of BPV's deleterious effect, and identify potentially effective methods to reduce BPV, the
proposed study will: 1) prospectively validate that “short-term” and “long-term” BPV after AIS onset is associated
with functional outcome and define the effect size of different levels of BPV, 2) utilize portable MRI to confirm
that final infarct volume, infarct growth and hemorrhagic transformation between baseline (measured within 12
hours of hospital arrival) and 72 hours are mechanistically related to BPV, and 3) utilize bedside pupillometry to
determine how the autonomic nervous system contributes to BPV after AIS and evaluate the class effect of
antihypertensive medications on BPV. To achieve these goals, we will enroll 150 patients who have anterior
circulation stroke and a baseline NIH Stroke Scale ≥6 within 12 hours of AIS onset at three study sites. With
completion of the Aims, we will define the outcome for a future trial (disability at 90 days vs. infarct volume or HT
vs. post-stroke cognitive impairment at 12 months vs. composites), the effect size of BPV on individual outcomes
and composites, the duration for lowering BPV (24-72 hours vs. weeks or months), and potential interventions
to reduce BPV. Pharmacologic BPV reduction would be an inexpensive and widely available intervention, able
to be administered in a range of healthcare settings. By completing the proposed Aims, we will be ideally
positioned to test accessible targeted interventions to diminish the morbidity and mortality of AIS."

histopathological hallmarks of AD. However, a diagnosis of AD in the early stages of dementia
cannot be determined simply by amyloid imaging, because many healthy older adults with brain
Aβ deposits never develop dementia. Therefore, additional markers that can provide more
accurate information of neurodegeneration, particular at the early stage, are needed. The brain
lymphatic system, named the glymphatic system, is a recently discovered cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) circulation system that utilizes the perivascular channels to eliminate soluble proteins and
metabolite. The dysfunction of the glymphatic system promotes Aβ deposition in the
meninges and introduces perfusion reduction and cognitive impairment. A critical barrier for
understanding CSF turnover including the glymphatic system is a lack of noninvasive methods
that can be applied to interrogate multiple aspects of the glymphatic system in vivo.
 We recently developed several non-invasive MRI approaches that can assess CSF
secretion and reabsorption in situ with MRI. These include a molecular imaging method,
dynamic glucose-enhanced (DGE) imaging with on-resonance Variable Delay Multiple Pulse
(onVDMP) MRI. as well as a set of spin- labeling based MRI methods, named magnetization
transfer indirect spin labeling (MISL) and phase alternate labeling with null recovery (PALAN).
These latter methods selectively label the paraventricular tissues by exploiting their significantly
different protein concentration and water T1, T2, cand diffusion properties. The PALAN
method can also assess the ISF flow in brain without contrast agents. Our long- term goal is to
develop several clinically translatable MRI schemes that can non-invasively detect CSF and
interstitial fluid water exchange in brain and apply them as potential MRI biomarkers for the
early-stage AD."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobin disorder that is highly prevalent in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), with over 75% of affected global births occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Early diagnosis
through pediatric screening, parental education, and preventive treatments are known to reduce deaths;
however, lack of infrastructure and the high cost of diagnostic tools in low-resource settings severely limit early
detection. As a result, many pediatric SCD patients present to a hospital with acute, severe anemia without a
diagnosis and receive emergency blood transfusions. Existing point-of-care tests function by detecting and
characterizing the hemoglobin proteins present in a sample. In cases of blood transfusion, these tests detect
normal hemoglobin transfused from the blood donor as well as sickle hemoglobin, therefore misdiagnosing
patients as sickle cell carriers. This limitation means existing point-of-care tests cannot be used for up to three
months with patients who have received a blood transfusion, which causes significant delays in the time to
diagnosis and prevents initiation of treatment. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive, easy-to-use test that
targets the genetic basis of the disease and can rapidly deliver results so that accurate treatment can be initiated
immediately at the point of care.
To address this need, we will develop a rapid, inexpensive nucleic acid-based test to detect the common point
mutations in the β globin gene that cause SCD: βS(Glu6Val) and βC(Glu6Lys). We propose a test that can
differentiate the following clinically relevant genotypes: 1) SCD patients (βSβS: SS, βSβC: SC); 2) unaffected
individuals (βAβA: AA); 3) SCD carriers (βAβS: AS, βAβC: AC); and 4) Hemoglobin C disease (βCβC: CC). Because
blood transfusions contain globin proteins from the donor, a nucleic acid test is the only possibility to test infants
and children who have recently undergone blood transfusions. An inexpensive point-of-care test that allows rapid
detection of SCD in all patients would greatly improve care for children with SCD.
We aim to: (1) Design and validate the first genetic point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for sickle cell
disease that can be used in recently transfused patients; (2) Implement the test on a low-cost, manufacturable,
fully integrated sample-to-answer platform; and (3) Evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and usability of the test in two
pilot clinical studies.
Our team at Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine, and Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi has
the necessary expertise in bioengineering and clinical diagnostics to address the challenge of diagnosing SCD
in resource-limited settings. Our proposed assay meets the optimal requirements for point-of-care testing in
LMICs. Finally, it would eliminate the long delays currently associated with sample transport or transfusion from
screen-positive patients to testing centers, and would enable immediate initiation of treatment for infants and
children with a diagnosis of SCD."

Despite widespread vaccination, influenza (flu) remains a leading cause of death among older adults.
Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infectious disease. However, older adults have dysregulated
immune responses that reduce vaccine efficacy and leave them at risk for severe infection and death. Older
adults have reduced T cell proliferation, impaired B cell responses, and decreased antibody titers following flu
vaccination. Current methods to improve vaccine efficacy in older adults target singular deficits in immune
responses and fail to completely rescue responses. Vaccination requires a complex coordination of multiple
cell types and tissues; thus an approach that targets the overall biology of aging, in line with the geroscience
hypothesis, may be more appropriate for improving vaccine protection and immune responses in older adults.
Senescent cell accumulation is a hallmark of aging and evident in various tissues with age. Although these
cells are characterized by a mostly irreversible state of cell cycle arrest, they remain metabolically active and
importantly, secrete a heterogeneous cocktail of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to
tissue dysfunction and damage that is coined senescence associate secretory phenotype (SASP).
Accumulation of senescent cells and SASP create pro-inflammatory environments and have a causal role in
many age-related disorders. CD4 T cells and B cells, the main cells responsible for robust vaccination
responses, are extremely sensitive to their microenvironments. Thus, we propose that accumulation of
senescent cells and their SASP drive diminished vaccination responses with aging.
Importantly, drugs that specifically kill senescent cells, termed senolytics, have been developed and require
only intermittent administration to eliminate senescence cells and mitigate the SASP. The safety and efficacy
of senolytics have been shown in mouse studies and can alleviate a range of age-related diseases. Human
pilot studies have supported their safety and clinical utility in certain pathologies. However, the impact of
senolytics on vaccination responses in aged populations has not yet been examined. The overall hypothesis
in this proposal is that senescent cells and the SASP play a causal role in impaired flu vaccination
responses with aging and that pharmacological clearance of senescent cells will improve vaccination
responses. We will test this hypothesis by treating young and aged mice with senolytic drugs prior to
vaccination. We will utilize two different vaccination methods, recombinant flu nucleoprotein to induce
protective immunity and adjuvanted inactivated flu to induce neutralizing immunity, and then infect mice with flu
to interrogate both cell-mediated and humoral vaccination responses. Additionally, we will test our hypothesis
in human cells by determining how senescent cell conditioned media impact human T and B cells responses in
culture. These approaches will allow us to examine the role of cellular senescence in impaired vaccination
responses with aging and investigate the translational utility of senolytic drugs as a pre-vaccination adjuvant."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer death in
the United States, with an estimated incidence of 151,030 new cases in 2022. According to the American Cancer
Society, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women. Tumor budding
is a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer with potential to risk stratify patients and possibly guide treatment
decisions. It is defined as the presence of a single tumor cell or a cell cluster consisting of fewer than five tumor
cells at the invasive tumor front. Unfortunately, tumor budding is not routinely disclosed in pathology reports due
to lack of reproducible methods in identifying tumor buds from H&E slides. The prevalence, mortality, and risk of
colorectal cancer as well as the potential of tumor budding as a prognostic factor necessitate an accurate, easy-
to-use, reproducible system to identify tumor budding. We aim to develop a computer-aided image analysis
system to standardize the quantitative criteria used to define tumor budding from H&E slides. In addition to
identifying tumor buds, the system will correlate tumor buds with several outcomes (microsatellite instability
status, overall survival, progression free survival, and disease free survival). As part of the proposed computer-
aided image analysis system, we will first develop a sophisticated method for color deconvolution to compensate
for color variations. This will be followed by deformable image registration and deep learning modules to
differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions. The study will show that machines can be trained using deep learning
to identify different anatomical regions within H&E slides of colorectal patients. From thereon, we will rely on
scale-space theory and alpha-shapes to identify tumor buds and hotspots. We will use mathematical morphology
and differential geometry to extract visually meaningful imaging features from tumor buds and hotspots. We will
explore the potential of these imaging features along with features produced by our unsupervised multiple
instance learning in predicting outcomes. The proposed research will help identify the association of tumor
budding to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model will be subjected to rigorous statistical analysis for accuracy
and reproducibility. The project will result in innovative software tools that facilitate the selection for personalized
cancer therapies for colorectal patients."

Toxoplasma latently infects approximately 30% of the human population and is refractory to acute stage
therapies. Latent Toxoplasma can act as a reservoir for acute stage reactivation in immunocompromised
individuals and can cause progressive blindness in otherwise healthy individuals. Thus, latent stages are
clinically important, but currently untreatable.
Drug resistance is likely due to changes in the metabolism of latent stages, but what these are remain a complete
mystery. Furthermore, latent Toxoplasma is exposed to different nutritional environments when infecting its
target tissue types – muscle and the central nervous system (CNS) – and the impact this has on Toxoplasma
latency is not understood. We have found that changes in carbon sources, that mimic muscle and CNS trigger
Toxoplasma differentiation into latent forms. We then performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen and identified
select Toxoplasma carbon catabolic enzymes that are required for differentiation and furthermore, identified a
role for ubiquitination in metabolic adaptation and differentiation into latent forms.
These background studies form the basis for developing a comprehensive understanding of Toxoplasma
metabolism during latency and understanding how metabolic rewiring is linked to differentiation through
regulation by ubiquitination. The specific aims of this program are to:
Aim 1: Define the metabolic pathways required for differentiation and persistence of latent Toxoplasma.
We will determine the role of select enzymes (identified in CRISPR screen) required for utilization of carbon
sources that mimic brain and muscle and their impact on differentiation in vitro and in vivo. This will determine
how metabolism of latent and acute stages differs and how this is linked to environmental sensing and
differentiation.
Aim 2: Determine the role of ubiquitination in the regulation of differentiation into latent forms. Define the
composition, biochemical activity and structure of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is important for
differentiation into latent forms, thus determining how ubiquitination regulates differentiation.
Aim 3: Define how ubiquitination regulates metabolism and differentiation into latent forms. We have
identified likely substrates of the E3 ubiquitination machinery and will define their function in regulation of both
metabolism and differentiation."
10830258,"Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a degenerative joint disease that arises after injury and affects millions
worldwide. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments. PTOA is a complex, multi-tissue joint disease
characterized by pain, cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation and fibrosis, and formation of ectopic bone
growths called osteophytes. The inherent complexity of this disease is a barrier to developing effective
treatments, as little is known about the intricate tissue crosstalk that underlies PTOA progression. Our long-
term goal is to uncover and comprehensively characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms central to key
pathological sequalae of PTOA: synovial fibrosis, inflammation, and osteophyte formation. We will focus on
canonical Wnt/β-catenin (cWnt) signaling. cWnt overactivation has recently been implicated as a driving factor
of arthritis. Our data show that the cWnt signaling agonist R-spondin 2 (Rspo2) is strongly induced in multiple
joint tissues during PTOA, and that Rspo2 alone is sufficient to induce pathological features characteristic of
PTOA. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we profiled synovium of mice with PTOA and found that Rspo2 is produced
by synovial lining fibroblasts. We identified a novel population of pro-fibrotic cells that arise after injury and
express Lgr cell surface receptors for Rspo2. We showed that synovial fibroblasts respond to Rspo2 by
secreting cytokines that in turn activate pro-inflammatory macrophages (known to drive synovial pathology in
PTOA). Single-cell profiling also revealed a novel subset of injury-induced, Lgr-expressing osteochondral
progenitors in synovium, which we propose give rise to osteophytes. We hypothesize that Rspo2-driven cWnt
signaling mediates pathological crosstalk between joint-resident cell types to potentiate PTOA. To test this, our
aims in the K99 phase are to: 1) determine the role of Rspo2-driven cWnt signaling in the emergence and
function of pro-fibrotic synovial cells during PTOA using transgenic reporter mice, multi-omic analyses, and in
vitro differentiation assays, and 2) characterize crosstalk between cWnt-active synovial fibroblasts and pro-
inflammatory macrophages, using knockout mice and crosstalk assays. To extend upon my molecular biology
and immunology expertise, I will receive rigorous technical and conceptual training from my diverse mentorship
committee during the K99 phase, and valuable career guidance. This expert training in bioinformatics; cWnt
signaling; bone, cartilage, and synovial biology; and multi-modal imaging, will be crucial for carrying out my
K99 aims and especially critical for successfully launching my independent career. These skills will be utilized
in my R00 phase to: 3) determine how Rspo2/Lgr signaling promotes osteophyte formation in PTOA, using
tissue-specific deletion and reporter mice, and in vitro differentiation assays. This work will significantly extend
our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin synovial fibrosis, inflammation, and
osteophyte formation in PTOA. These insights will have meaningful, tangible outcomes for human health, by
accelerating development of effective disease-modifying treatments for PTOA sufferers."
11138921,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Essential, life-long bone remodeling is coordinated by osteoclasts (OCs) that resorb old bone and osteoblasts
that deposit new bone. Elevated OC formation/function erodes excess bone, weakens the skeleton, and
underpins bone disease in >200 million individuals world-wide. Mononucleated preOCs fuse and form
multinucleated OCs through a formative process – multinucleation. OC multinucleation regulates how much
bone OCs resorb and is often elevated in OC-based bone disease. Despite its role in skeletal health and
disease, how OC multinucleation is regulated remains poorly understood. We discovered that lupus la protein’s
(La) expression, cleavage, and trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM) regulate OC fusion, multinucleation,
and bone resorption. Moreover, our preliminary findings demonstrate that inhibiting PM La during OC
multinucleation suppresses the progression of OC-based bone disease. Resolving the mechanism of OC
multinucleation will fill fundamental gaps in our understanding of skeletal health, identify pathways perturbed in
disease, and establish novel therapeutic targets for preventing bone loss.
In this study, we will resolve the mechanism by which La regulates OC multinucleation (Aims 1 & 3) and employ
a novel, ex vivo model to characterize the contribution of perturbed OC-to-osteoblast signaling in the progression
of OC-based bone disease. First, we will use a semi-automated peptide screening assay to identify the La
domain that facilitates its regulatory function in OC multinucleation (Aim 1). Second, we will resolve how La
traffics to the OC PM to promote multinucleation, is removed and degraded to stop multinucleation, and how
perturbed La membrane trafficking contributes to the uncontrolled multinucleation observed in SNX10-linked
infantile osteopetrosis (Aim 3). Finally, we find that ectopic OC multinucleation in fibrous dysplasia, an OC-based
bone disease, leads to excessive OC signaling and disease related changes in preosteoblasts. In Aim 2, we will
characterize perturbed OC signaling in a novel ex vivo model of fibrous dysplasia, assess its impact on
preosteoblast function, and test whether perturbed OC-to-osteoblast signaling contributes to disease
progression in vivo. This research firmly aligns with NICHD’s mission to resolve fundamental gaps in our
understanding of life-long human development and will identify novel targets and test treatment strategies for
addressing the childhood bone diseases fibrous dysplasia and infantile osteopetrosis. In addition to completing
the proposed aims, I will gain critical experience in the implementation of in vivo models to study the development
of bone diseases, machine learning approaches for studying osteoclast multinucleation, and effective mentorship
and management strategies for leading my independent laboratory. My proposed aims will generate new
research directions, and my career development, networking, and training goals will prepare me to become a
leading independent investigator that expands our understanding of skeletal health and disease."

Ferroportin is the only iron exporter in humans. Mutations in ferroportin cause
hemochromatosis. Ferrorpotin is regulated by a peptide hormone hepcidin, which is
produced in the liver and inhibits the activity of ferrorportin by inducing endocytosis and
by direct inhibition of ferroportin activity. The FPN-hepcidin axis is a potential therapeutic
target for normalizing iron homeostasis in hemochromatosis. However, very little is
known about how ferroportin recognizes and transport iron and how it interacts with
hepcidin. In this study, I will combine structural and functional analyses to understand
the mechanism of iron transport and inhibition in ferroportin at the atomic resolution."

Modern multi-platform genomic data sets contain substantial molecular information potentially useful for discovering
new precision therapeutic strategies. Integration across multi-platform data and across genes using network-based
models is a key to extracting mechanistic molecular information embedded in these data. In this proposal, we develop
integrative network-based methods that ll gaps in existing literature. They will be used to identify key pathways for
a given disease and its subtypes, nd key upstream regulators of these pathways and determine which appear to be
causal, construct pathway signatures potentially usable for patient selection, and identify factors modulating pathway
associations. While our methods will be applicable to any disease setting, our initial focus will be to use multi-platform
genomic data sets to provide a deep molecular characterization of four recently discovered consensus molecular subtypes
(CMS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) to arm our biomedical and clinical collaborators with knowledge to devise and test
new precision therapeutic strategies targeting these subtypes. For these purposes, we propose the following aims:
Speci c Aim 1: We will devise a novel model formulation regressing pathway scores on upstream genetic and epigenetic
factors to identify a sparse set of potential pathway drivers. We will identify characteristic pathways for each CMS and
for each pathway identify potential drivers that our biomedical collaborators will functionally validate via CRISPR and
identify potential matching drug targets. We will also develop novel Bayesian hierarchically linked regression models
(BLINK) that will determine which cancers share common pathway drivers and thus are candidates for sharing a common
targeted therapy, while increasing power for discovery of pathway drivers for rare cancers.
Speci c Aim 2: We will develop network mediation analysis approaches to discover putative causal network edges
in multi-layered graphs of multi-platform genomic data. We will use these methods to more deeply characterize the
networks underlying key CMS-characteristic pathways and determine which potential pathway drivers appear to be
causal, and which mediators are predictive of response to therapy. From these networks, we will devise methods to
construct pathway signatures integrating multi-platform molecular information to provide a single-number, patient-
speci c summary of pathway activity potentially useful for patient selection for precision therapeutics.
Speci c Aim 3: We will develop novel Bayesian network regression methods for undirected and multi-layer networks
that identify heterogeneous network structure varying linearly or nonlinearly across patient-speci c covariates. We
will apply these methods to key networks identi ed for CRC data to discover how these networks vary across various
covariates, including subtypes (CMS), biological factors (immune in ltration), and clinical response.
Successful completion of this work will produce a broad set of rigorous tools for integrative and network modeling of
multi-platform genomic data, and will provide our CRC collaborators with a short list of key CMS-speci c pathways and
drivers for functional validation and clinical translation via CMS-based precision therapeutics. Our dissemination eﬀorts
will include software for our methods and Shiny apps for exploring biological underpinnings of CRC."
10773102,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
Currently, the treatment of COPD relies on a stepwise algorithm of inhaler therapies without targeting systemic
processes. Mounting evidence suggests that activated platelets may play a role in COPD but the mechanisms
and impact of platelet activation on COPD outcomes are not known. Furthermore, it has been difficult to
differentiate respiratory events from cardiovascular symptoms since COPD and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
are highly comorbid. Understanding the role of platelets and potential for targeted antiplatelet therapy in COPD
patients without CVD could lead to novel therapeutic options. Prior studies demonstrating an association
between platelet activation and worse respiratory morbidity in COPD have employed non-specific surrogate
biomarkers. Likewise, prior studies showing an association of aspirin use with improved COPD morbidity and
mortality have been among prevalent users in observational cohorts susceptible to selection bias and
confounding by indication. In order to understand the potential role of specific platelet activation pathways on
respiratory morbidity in COPD, we propose directly measuring platelet activation and reactivity in a sample of
115 individuals with COPD without overt or subclinical CVD as determined by absence of coronary artery
calcification on computed tomography scan. Specifically, we will measure membrane receptors uniquely
expressed on activated platelets (CD62P/P-selectin, CD63, CD154/CD4L, and PAC1), platelet-leukocyte
conjugates (platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil conjugates), and platelet response (i.e. change in
activation) to stimulation with three agonists (adenosine diphosphate, thromboxane, and serotonin). We
hypothesize that higher proportion of baseline circulating activated platelets, higher proportion of platelet-
leukocyte conjugates, and increased platelet reactivity in response to low doses of agonists will be associated
with higher baseline respiratory symptoms, worse quality of life and higher rate of acute exacerbations of COPD
over 1 year. Furthermore, we will conduct a randomized double-blinded sequential crossover study of three
aspirin doses in 48 individuals with COPD without CVD to determine the most effective aspirin dose for
suppression of platelet activation and reactivity in this population. Completion of the proposed aims will elucidate
the role of platelet activation and reactivity pathways on respiratory outcomes in COPD and inform the design of
a larger randomized controlled trial of antiplatelet therapy in COPD. We will recruit from the large pool of
participants in ongoing and completed COPD studies at Johns Hopkins supplemented by leveraging the
infrastructure of the Johns Hopkins COPD Precision Medicine Center of Excellence. My ultimate career goal is
to be an independent translational researcher focusing on identifying novel targets for individualized therapy in
COPD. My career development plan includes expert mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience
to develop new skills in COPD endotyping, translational research, platelet biology, and clinical trial design."
10795953,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Alveolar Capillary Dysplasia with Misalignment of Pulmonary Veins (ACDMPV) is a
fatal congenital disorder of neonates and infants which leads to respiratory insufficiency due to reduced
numbers of alveolar capillaries and is associated with lung hypoplasia, hemorrhage, malposition of pulmonary
veins and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). ACDMPV is linked to mutations in the Forkhead Box F1
(FOXF1) gene and is resistant to all available therapies and respiratory support, causing cyanosis and
respiratory failure in the first month after birth. In rare cases, ACDMPV patients survive several months or even
years, but they require lung transplantation early in life. Given the lack of effective treatments for ACDMPV,
there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches to stimulate pulmonary angiogenesis and
preserve respiratory function in ACDMPV infants. In our preliminary data, we have generated a clinically
relevant model of ACDMPV by introducing the S52F FOXF1 mutation (found in ACDMPV patients) into the
endogenous mouse Foxf1 gene locus. Foxf1WT/S52F newborn mice exhibited alveolar capillary dysplasia,
misalignment of pulmonary veins, PAH, and increased mortality, all key features of human ACDMPV.
Endothelial proliferation and STAT3 signaling were decreased in Foxf1WT/S52F mice and human ACDMPV
lungs. In the present grant application, we will test the hypothesis that increasing neonatal lung angiogenesis
will decrease PAH, improve survival and prevent lung remodeling in mouse ACDMPV models. In Aim 1, we
have developed a novel nanoparticle gene delivery system targeting >85% of pulmonary endothelial cells in
vivo when delivered into the neonatal blood circulation. Nanoparticle delivery of STAT3 cDNA after birth
induced endothelial proliferation and increased alveolar microvascular density in Foxf1WT/S52F neonatal lungs.
We will use two mouse models of ACDMPV (Foxf1WT/S52F and Foxf1+/-) to test whether nanoparticle delivery of
STAT3 or FOXF1 will decrease PAH, improve survival and prevent lung remodeling. We will also determine
whether the FOXF1/STAT3/cMYC transcriptional cascade is required for neonatal lung angiogenesis. In Aim
2, we provided preliminary data demonstrating that a cell transplantation with pulmonary endothelial progenitor
cells (EPCs) (FOXF1+cKit+CD31+CD45-) increases the capillary density in Foxf1WT/S52F lungs. We will
investigate heterogeneity of pulmonary EPCs and test their therapeutic potential in mouse ACDMPV models.
We will test if EPCs stimulate neonatal lung angiogenesis via the BMP-9/ACVRL1 signaling pathway. Finally,
we will use a novel protocol for in vitro differentiation of EPCs from mouse and human embryonic stem cells
(ES) and determine if a cell therapy with ES-derived EPCs will be beneficial in mouse ACDMPV models.
Altogether, the proposed studies will directly test whether endothelial delivery of STAT3 or cell therapy with
EPCs have therapeutic potential in ACDMPV."

While obesity, ancestry, family history of diabetes, insulin resistance, and puberty are all risk
factors for pediatric-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D), identifying the subset of youth at greatest risk of
advancing from “prediabetes” to T2D and the mechanisms underlying the deterioration remain
elusive. This lack of specificity defies the medical community's ability to 1) direct care to the youth
at greatest risk of pediatric onset T2D and 2) develop targeted interventions. The particularly
aggressive nature of pediatric T2D and the unique hormonal milieu of the adolescent suggest
while the mechanisms underlying adult-onset T2D in adults resonate in pediatric T2D, additional
perturbances are operative. Our team proposes to collaborate in a multi-center study, informed
by partnerships with family and community members, to define clinically accessible metrics of
increased diabetes risk as well as potential mechanisms that compromise the normal adaptations
to insulin resistance during adolescence. We propose a longitudinal study leveraging a 3-hour,
multi-sample oral glucose tolerance test performed at baseline, 18-months, and 36-months in
obese pubertal youth with pre-diabetes to 1) test the utility of the one-hour glucose in predicting
T2D and deterioration in insulin secretion, 2) perform extensive phenotyping for testing the
relationships of changes in insulin secretion (early phase and second phase), insulin sensitivity,
incretin secretion, glucagon suppression, hepatic glucose clearance, and free fatty flux with
emergence of T2D. The contributions of genetic variants, in utero environment, visceral adipose
accumulation, eating behaviors, mental health issues, social determinants of health, diet, physical
activity, sleep and COVID infection to perturbances in insulin secretion and sensitivity will be
tested. Home health care workers will provide additional critical insight into the home environment.
Glucose-potentiated arginine stimulation tests will be conducted in subsets of participants in
whom glucose homeostasis is preserved, worsens, or advances to T2D. This study is anticipated
to specify useful indicators of T2D risk and advance our understanding of the underpinnings of
progressive defects in insulin secretion and sensitivity to inform individualized programs aimed at
interrupting emergence of T2D."
10930804,"Many patients who survive critical illness, including sepsis and acute respiratory failure, have arduous
recoveries plagued by an inability to recover muscle and physical function after hospital discharge, resulting in
lower quality of life, inability to return to work and disability. The number of patients surviving critical illnesses in
the United States continues to rise each year and therefore it is critically important to develop interventions that
will support their recovery. Clinical and muscle cellular factors driving skeletal muscle dysfunction are relatively
unknown after an acute critical illness, but are necessary to inform intervention development. We will address
this knowledge gap by studying myofibrillar and collagen protein turnover, cellular signaling pathways, and
markers of damage, inflammation and immune response in the first year of recovery. The unique aspect of this
proposal is the serial, intra-patient muscle tissue sampling paired with simultaneously obtained clinical
functional parameters over the first year of recovery post hospital discharge. Physical function and quality of
life outcomes will be assessed to understand why some patients recover muscle function, yet others develop
severe disability. The overall goal of this clinical observational study is to elucidate the cellular environment
and the patient’s clinical characteristics contributing to failed muscle recovery and physical disability in
survivors of critical illness. Our central hypothesis is that alterations in myofibrillar, mitochondrial and collagen
protein homeostasis are underlying muscle and physical dysfunction in patients surviving critical illness. In Aim
1, we will identify trajectory of recovery for muscle strength and power, as well as physical function in patients
surviving ICU-related critical illness including pneumonia, sepsis, and COVID-19 etiologies. We hypothesize
that patients with a higher initial severity of illness will show poor recovery of muscle strength and physical
function during the first year of recovery. In Aim 2, we will determine mechanisms of skeletal muscle
deficiencies contributing to disparate recovery in patients surviving ICU-related COVID-19 or other acute lung
injury etiologies. We hypothesize that patients with longer ICU durations will show poor recovery of muscle size
and increased collagen deposition during the first year of recovery. In addition, we hypothesize that patients
with persistent weakness and fatigue have prolonged impairments in mitochondrial function compared to
patients who recover their muscle function. Finally, we hypothesize that patients with long-term disability have
an inability to recover muscle function due to a cellular environment of that is not permissive to a positive
protein balance. We will use stable isotope mass spectroscopy measurements of muscle biopsies to determine
synthesis of myofibrillar, mitochondrial and collagen protein. Findings from this study, will inform why some
patients develop persistent disability and others gradually improve. The results from this research will guide
future development of therapeutic interventions that are specific to skeletal muscle deficits with consideration
for patient related factors such as age and co-morbid burden."

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) affects 10-20% of the population and is associated with
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and mortality. Emerging data suggest that targeting EDS may
provide a novel intervention for improving CVD. However, findings are limited by self-reported
data and heterogeneity. There is a need to dissect and understand the underlying drivers of EDS
subtypes, and to determine whether there are subtypes causally related to CVD and potentially
modifiable. Our recent work identified two subtypes of EDS – sleep propensity (SP; characterized
by objectively measured long sleep duration, high efficiency, and less fragmentation) and sleep
fragmentation (SF; short sleep duration and low efficiency). Each of them is common in the
population, associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and different genetic backgrounds.
We hypothesize that SP is a novel sleep phenotype that reflects a property of the need of staying
asleep; dissecting EDS into SP and SF subtypes will facilitate identification of genetic and
physiological mechanisms for EDS, and improve understanding of pleiotropic or causal
associations with CVD risk. In order to test these hypotheses, we will leverage macro- and micro-
sleep architecture measurements, genomics, and other -omics data in population-based cohorts.
We will address the following specific aims: 1) To identify demographic, behavioral, clinical and
neurophysiological factors (assessed by actigraphy and electroencephalography) for SP and SF,
and refine classification of EDS subtypes if needed; 2) To identify genetic variants and molecular
pathways associated with EDS subtypes and generate robust polygenetic risk score for risk
stratification; 3) To systematically evaluate the causal or non-causal associations between EDS
subtypes and CVD traits; 4) To identify the modification effect of each EDS subtype on genetic
susceptibility of CVD using gene-environment interaction analyses. This work will advance our
understanding of the heterogeneity of EDS, reveal biological mechanisms and pathways linking
to CVD, and provide information that will guide clinical and public health interventions as well as
provide directions for future laboratory research."

Preclinical studies and early stage human trials evaluating passively transferred broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) suggest that a vaccine capable of eliciting bnAbs would provide
effective protection from HIV infection. However, the difficulty of inducing bnAbs through
vaccination has led to a focus in the field on vaccine strategies based on sequential immunizations
meant to guide the developing B cell response. These sequential immunization strategies range
from germline targeting to lineage-guided design to immunofocusing, and combinations thereof.
While logical from a structural biology perspective, important immunological questions remain
unanswered for such vaccines: In such a strategy, at what interval should sequential immunogens
be administered? How does competition from antigen-specific but non-neutralizing B cell
precursors impact vaccine “shepherding”? Is this sequential immunization process hindered by
limited T cell help? In addition, vaccines comprised of 4 or more injections will be a challenge to
implement globally. How do we make such a vaccine practical? In this phase R61/R33
application, we propose systematic studies in small animal models to evaluate fundamental
vaccine immunology issues facing such strategies. We proposed several novel approaches to
examine, and potentially solve, these issues: In aim 1 we will characterize the immunology of
staggered sequential immunizations, in aim 2 we develop an approach to delete competitor B
cells during vaccination, in aim 3 we develop vaccines employing augmented T cell help, and in
aim 4, we propose technologies to enable sequential immunogen exposure following a single
injection. We will test these concepts in the context of vaccines aiming to elicit bnAbs against the
CD4 binding site (VRC01-class responses) and the Env fusion peptide, using physiologically
relevant conditions. The most impactful of these immunization strategies will be downselected for
testing in non-human primates (NHP) during the R33 phase, the animal model for HIV
immunization closest to humans. Our work is guided by recent advances by the Irvine, Crotty,
and Silvestri labs in understand GC kinetics, bnAb B cell competition,vaccine delivery systems,
novel adjuvants, and roles of T cell help in rare B cell recruitment."
10830376,"Leveraging our institution’s diverse and experienced investigator base, our success in leading collaborative
and single-site randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and mechanistic and observational studies, and our access to
a large population of urban, disadvantaged, and largely minority youth with asthma, we propose the District of
Columbia’s Childhood Asthma in Urban Settings Clinical Research Center (DC CAUSE-CRC). It will implement
network-wide research projects with a multi-disciplinary team of senior and junior investigators bringing diverse
backgrounds in pediatric asthma, allergy and immunology, airway multi-omics, and computational biology. The
proposed clinical leadership has repeatedly succeeded as top enrollers in multi-site asthma research
collaboratives, and our institution houses the required infrastructure to facilitate CAUSE’s collaborative studies.
For our site-specific project, we will build on the prior work of the Inner City Asthma Consortium (ICAC) and
explore the mechanistic and clinical aspects of the paradigm-shifting use of a single dose of omalizumab in the
fall season to prevent exacerbations. Specifically, while providing pilot clinical data for a possible future RCT,
we will examine the interaction of the nasal microbiome and the nasal inflammatory responses during viral
upper respiratory infections (URIs) with and without a single dose of anti-IgE. Working synergistically in
exacerbation-prone urban youth, allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and rhinovirus (and other viral) URIs
trigger a strong Th2 response and asthma exacerbations that occur most frequently after school begins (the
“September epidemic”). The ICAC has demonstrated that when administered across the entire fall season,
omalizumab reduces the odds of exacerbations by >50%. Given the cost and complexity of this approach,
however, and noting that serum levels of omalizumab rise following subcutaneous injection within a time frame
sufficient to prevent a virally induced exacerbation (7-8 days), we propose an entirely new strategy:
Omalizumab Before Onset of Exacerbations (OBOE). It is a pilot, non-therapeutic, mechanistic RCT of
omalizumab or placebo administered within 72 hours of onset of an URI. Over three fall seasons, OBOE will
randomize at least 100 youth aged 6-17 years with persistent asthma, high atopy, and a recent exacerbation.
We will “capture” their URIs for 90 days after school starts, sampling their nasal airways twice (within 72 hours
of URI onset and again in a window between 7-10 days after URI onset). Our specific aims are: (1) to be
leaders in the collaborative studies of the CAUSE network while fostering the next generation of local
institutional leadership for DC CAUSE-CRC; (2) to determine the relationship among the nasal airway
microbiome, host transcriptome, and Th2 responses in children treated with single dose omalizumab or
placebo at the onset of viral URIs; (3) to determine the relationship between host nasal airway antiviral
interferon-α response with and without omalizumab given at the onset of a viral URI; and (4-exploratory): to
determine the differences in clinical outcomes between intervention and control participants."
10811593,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine cancer of the skin with a dismal five-year
survival rate of less than 18% in advanced disease and a mortality rate 3-times higher than melanoma. MCC
disproportionately and predominantly affects Caucasian males older than 65, who are well represented among
Veterans, and more than 5000 new MCC cases have been diagnosed among Veterans. Hence, MCC has a
growing impact on Veterans’ health and VA healthcare system. Notwithstanding the approval of immunotherapy,
treating metastatic MCC remains a challenge. Thus, we are compelled to seek novel therapies to overcome
resistance, or to serve as definitive treatments for MCC patients who are ineligible for immunotherapy due to
comorbidities.
 In this proposal, we will collaborate with VA Medical Centers encountering most Veteran MCC patients to
define the role of B7-H3 (encoded by CD276) in MCC patient survival in a large cohort of Veteran patients.
Moreover, we will determine the efficacy of CD276-targeted therapy, as its overexpression has been associated
with poor outcome in a myriad of advanced human cancer including MCC. Our collaborator, Dr. St. Croix at the
National Cancer Institute, has developed a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC, m276-SL-PBD), which couples
CD276 antibody with a cytotoxic DNA-binding agent PBD. Notably, m276-SL-PBD confers robust anti-tumor
activities and long-term durability in a range of preclinical models, including our MCC cell line-derived xenograft
(CDX) models (preliminary data leading to this proposal). Remarkably, m276-SL-PBD effectively prevents
resistance by directly eradicating heterogenous cancer cells including cancer stem cells, tumor vasculatures
and tumor stromal cells, where CD276 upregulation is endowed. Therefore, we postulate that m276-SL-PBD is
a superior anti-MCC drug with sustainable response, underscoring a novel therapeutic advance in MCC.
 To overcome barriers, we have successfully established unique and robust models for MCC preclinical
studies including multiple primary MCC cell lines, CDX, and patient tumor-derived xenograft (PDX) models with
reconstituted human immune system. To simulate clinical scenario, we have first established human metastatic
MCC cell lines with propensity for spontaneous visceral dissemination after subcutaneous inoculation in mice.
Due to its finite resource, we will utilize single mouse testing (SMT)-base PDX trial strategies that are
increasingly used to better capture inter-tumor heterogeneity and generate highly clinically relevant preclinical
evidence. The cost-effectiveness of SMT-based studies allow to encompass a large cohort of patient tumors
and evaluate heterogeneous drug effects across patients, which is of particular importance in rare cancer
preclinical studies including MCC.
 Hence leveraging our singularly powerful patient MCC-derived models, we are ideally positioned to pursue
proposed studies: 1) to determine safety, therapeutic efficacy, and direct drug effects of m276-SL-PBD and
identify biomarkers for treatment response in MCC CDX models and metastatic models; 2) to determine
therapeutic efficacy of m276-SL-PBD and its effects on MCC tumor microenvironment in a panel of PDX mouse
models; 3) to define the impact of CD276 in MCC survival in Veteran patients. Findings will have near-term
impact by setting the stage for an immediate confirmatory clinical trial inclusive of VA healthcare systems to
ultimately improve access for Veterans suffering from this deadly skin cancer."
10783070,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Shigella is a primary cause of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in children living in impoverished areas of the world.
Shigella is known for causing dysentery (blood in stool). However, majority of the children infected with Shigella
present with watery diarrhea. The current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for treatment of
shigellosis (in the absence of a rapid, sensitive, simple and inexpensive diagnostic test) recommends treatment
with antibiotics when presence of visible blood in stool. Thus, the non-dysentery Shigella associated diarrhea
(NDSD) cases would not be treated with antibiotics. Absence of dysentery may not indicate a low risk of death
and does not exclude Shigella as a cause of diarrhea. In particularly vulnerable younger children or with
malnutrition, identification and treatment of Shigella infection might be life-saving. It may be hypothesized that
NDSD cases, if identified quickly, should be treated with antibiotics to improve survival and long-term
developmental potential in children. Identification of such cases will require a rapid test to document these
infections so that treatment can be initiated promptly, and evidence based.
To address these questions, we propose to conduct a prospective longitudinal case control study to understand
the pathophysiology of NDSD and the impact of NDSD in children compared to dysentery shigellosis. The
children seeking care in the hospital in Bangladesh with diarrhea (both dysentery and NDSD), that is positive for
Shigella and a third group with Shigella negative watery diarrhea will be enrolled and prospectively followed. Our
study has the following specific aims:
AIM 1. Determine morbidity and risk of hospitalization associated with NDSD cases and its impact on nutritional
status and cognitive development of the children.
AIM 2. Understand the impact of NDSD on gut barrier function, systemic and gut inflammation in children.
AIM 3. Evaluate if the simple and rapid test S-RLDT could be applicable for case detection and treatment of
shigellosis in the clinical settings of the rural hospitals of the endemic countries.
Collectively, our proposed research would broadly impact the field by understanding the pathophysiology of
NDSD and the impact of NDSD in child health. This study will help to understand if there is a need to change the
current guidelines of shigellosis treatment for better survival and development of the children. This study will also
validate a rapid test capable of identifying the patients who will benefit from antibiotics."

PIs: Ash Alizadeh, M.D./Ph.D. & Maximilian Diehn, M.D./Ph.D.
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is among the most curable human malignancies. However,
strategies to personalize HL therapies and to minimize long-term attendant toxicities of
chemotherapy are currently limited to baseline risk factors and imaging. This is due to our
incomplete understanding of targetable pathways and lack of good biomarkers. Because of the
low fraction of malignant cells in tumor tissue and consecutive technical challenges, the
landscape of HL is not well-defined.
Our long-term goal is to study the ability of baseline and dynamic risk factors, including genetic
mutations, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and imaging studies (PET), to accurately predict
treatment outcomes in HL patients, and to provide a basis for individualized precision medicine.
Our central hypothesis is that clinical and biological heterogeneity in HL reflects distinct
genomic features that are noninvasively measurable using ultrasensitive ctDNA techniques, and
that refining early response assessment integrating interim PET and blood based methods
improves prognostication. We will test our hypotheses via three specific aims: (1) To
noninvasively define the genomic landscape of somatic variations in HL, and to determine the
relationship of genomic variants with biological heterogeneity at initial disease presentation, (2)
To associate molecular features at baseline and molecular response with ultimate therapeutic
outcome, and to integrate clinical and molecular biomarkers in a personalized dynamic risk
model for predicting HL outcomes, and (3) To functionally characterize novel mutations in
Interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) resulting in gain-of-function IL4/STAT6 signaling, and to test the
utility of precision therapeutic targeting of these mutations.
If successful, our project will lead to novel ways to select better therapies for patients at highest
risk of failure, and to minimize toxicity for the majority of patients responding well to standard
therapy. Our innovative approach, in which we will combine blood-based methods for
genotyping and disease monitoring with imaging studies, will provide the basis for a
personalized treatment approach in HL."
10765658,"The coexistence of Alzheimer (AD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), which defines Mixed Dementia
(MxD) is present in many, if not most, of those diagnosed with AD. Hypertension is the major risk factor
contributing to CBVD, driving small vessel disease (SVD), associated with white matter (WM) lesions
characteristic of MxD, but the paucity of MxD models limits progress to understand mechanisms and advance
therapeutics for this common disease. For example, drugs developed to clear amyloid (Abeta) may exacerbate
CBVD, and fail to target poorly understood synergism between AD and CBVD. Our novel rat MxD model exhibits
coexisting vascular and AD pathologies (AD transgenic), whereby hypertension and SVD exacerbate AD-
associated aberrant neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and tauopathy (Denver et al. 2019). Since
recent clinical data, showing that WM damage is associated with the spread of tauopathy, not Abeta (Kapasi et
al., 2022), this further validates our model. Further new data on seeding of MxD rats with tau fibrils, recapitulates
tau spreading seen in human AD/MxD. The model was produced by breeding the Tg AD into a SHR-Stroke
prone (SHRSP) rat background, the most widely studied model for vascular cognitive impairment and SVD,
which exhibits a compromised neurovascular unit. Unlike mice, rats express all 6 tau isoforms and are more
suitable than mice for complex imaging and behavioral testing, and assessing fluid biomarkers. The central
hypotheses are: a) Complement factors are major components synergistically driving MxD and AD, and b) there
is a positive feedback loop between tau pathogenesis and complement activation such that antagonizing either
tau aggregation with structure-based inhibitors (Aim 2) or the complement cascade (Aim 3) will disproportionately
reduce WM damage, tauopathy and executive function deficits in the hypertensive MxD model. Aim 1 will identify
key MRI and laser captured pathology RNA expression profiles. 1A examines longitudinal changes of
translatable MRI imaging measures (including SVD, demyelination, atrophy, and BBB leakage) that distinguish
MxD from AD. In 1B, we perform IHC-guided laser capture microscopy dissection (LCM) and RNA seq in
these MRI-characterized rats in 3 regions representing increased tauopathy (hippocampus),
demyelination/WMH (dorsolateral/prefrontal cortex) and SVD (thalamus/putamen) to define MxD-specific, lesion-
related pathways. Aims 2 and 3 investigate how AD and hypertension interact to influence a positive feedback
loop between complement and tauopathy. Aim 2 uses a structure-based tau aggregation inhibitor that we
characterized in tau mouse models. Aim 3 uses a state-of-the-art orally bioavailable and brain penetrant small
molecule inhibitor (see letters), to investigate the causal role of C5aR activation that can drive tauopathy, BBB
breakdown and WM loss. Outcomes. Outcomes focus on regional biochemical and histological changes in BBB,
myelination, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and executive function deficits. CSF/plasma biomarkers are
assessed: specifically validated AD biomarkers (ptau, NFL, Abeta40/42) and those associated with brain
inflammation (GFAP, AQP4 (astrocytic endfoot protein)) or WMH (complement factors C3b, and Bb) and
neuroprotection (BDNF) to identify their role in the tau-complement C5a feedback loop. Interpretation: Advances
may include demonstration of hypertension-enhanced tauopathy and/or C5aR and tauopathy-enhanced BBB
breakdown and one or more effective new treatments. Alternatively, tau aggregate inhibitors may not impede
BBB and inflammatory pathogenesis, suggesting a minor role for the tau-inflammation-BBB loop and arguing for
combination therapies. Which upstream C3-related inflammatory or downstream C5b components are inhibited
by C5aR inhibitors will provide important insight into tau-complement feedback interactions in MxD. RNAseq is
likely to fill major knowledge gaps in understanding mechanisms of SVD that drive conversion from AD pathology
to onset of cognitive decline. Our proposal is strengthened by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in stroke,
MRI imaging, LCM /RNAseq, complement activation, CBVD/AD neuropathology, and executive dysfunction."
10932848,"Abstract. Chronic pelvic pain remains a challenging condition to treat, in large part because underlying
disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP) is a common form
of CPP wherein the severity of disease is only weakly associated with the degree of pain experienced. While
pelvic inflammation is a well-established contributing factor to EAPP, we propose that low-grade systemic
inflammation also contributes to the disease state by promoting central nervous system (CNS) sensitization.
Emerging evidence from our group and others suggests that low-grade systemic inflammation can promote
multiple aspects of CNS sensitization including clinical manifestations (comorbid pain conditions, widespread
pain), hypersensitivity to experimental stimuli, and altered brain functional connectivity in pelvic pain. While
hormonal suppression is effective for many women, and acts in part by dampening estradiol-dependent pelvic
inflammation, little is known about the relative contributions of low-grade systemic inflammation and CNS
sensitization to EAPP. We propose to use the FDA-approved, gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor
antagonist, elagolix, available in two dosages, as a mechanistic probe to assess the effects of pelvic and
systemic inflammation on EAPP. The presence of robust dose-dependent effects on EAPP and its comorbid
symptoms suggests to us that the higher dose also reduces CNS sensitization, possibly due to reduced
systemic inflammation. To investigate this hypothesis, we will conduct a double-blind, placebo controlled
randomized clinical trial in which 200 women with EAPP will be randomly assigned to low-dose (150mg daily)
or high-dose (400mg daily) elagolix or placebo with evaluation of pain mechanism outcomes prior to and after
treatment. We will focus on two common patient phenotypes – those with EAPP only and those with EAPP
and widespread pain (1:1 recruitment). In Aim 1, we will first define the relationship between pelvic
inflammation, systemic inflammation, and CNS sensitization using well-vetted neurobiological measures of
CNS sensitization. We anticipate that systemic inflammation will be associated with CNS sensitization, while
pelvic inflammation will not be. In Aim 2, we will identify dose-dependent changes in CNS sensitization as well
as systemic and pelvic inflammation during hormonal suppression for EAPP through the above-described
clinical trial. We anticipate that both dosages will improve pelvic inflammation, but that systemic inflammation
and CNS sensitization will be improved on high-dose elagolix. We furthermore anticipate that those with
widespread pain will be more likely to respond to high-dose elagolix. In an exploratory Aim 3, we will
determine if baseline levels of pelvic and/or systemic inflammatory activity, as well as CNS sensitization,
predict the response to elagolix. These studies are critical to develop alternative mechanistic models of pain
promotion and relief in this vulnerable group of patients and will have implications for understanding hormonal
contributions to the female preponderance of chronic pain syndromes."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is an exemplar monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) where a
tremendous body of multi-species translational research has elucidated the underlying molecular
pathophysiology, and more recently, in-depth electrophysiology of cortical function. Thus far,
phenotypic rescue in animal models has not resulted in treatment breakthroughs in humans. Central to
this discrepancy is a poor understanding of the constituent neurodynamics of averaged group effects
and individual variability in human brain activity as related to higher-level cognitive symptomatology
and clinical phenotype. Our large collection of preliminary data demonstrates that individuals with FXS
do not mount precise neural responses to the sensory auditory chirp and, instead, have “noisy”
asynchronous gamma activity. Furthermore, a marked reduction in alpha power suggests altered
thalamocortical function, reducing the ability to detect signal from noise and representing potential
tractable targets for “bottom-up” entrainment. Our approach involves three scientific aims, which, if
addressed, would ascertain underlying mechanisms that may alleviate sensory and cognitive
impairments. First, we will study transient, non-continuous features (neurodynamics) of alpha and
gamma oscillations in resting-state EEG and sensory auditory chirp that model patient-level
heterogeneity and constitute group effects (Aim 1A). We will also identify what, if any, of these novel
features are conserved in the Fmr1-/- KO using preexisting murine EEG data and represent patient
subgroups (Aim 1B). Second, we will extend into cognition by studying neurodynamics and circuit
modeling associated with statistical learning (SL), which shares similar neural mechanisms to the
sensory auditory chirp (Aim 2). Third, we will use individualized closed-loop alpha auditory entrainment
(AAE) to attempt the normalization of neural signatures of the sensory auditory chirp and SL tasks (Aim
3). Aim 1 and 2 findings will provide critical data to optimize closed-loop parameters of AAE to serve
as a “bottom-up” neural probe to understand the mechanics of disorder-relevant circuit activity through
perturbation of thalamocortical drive. Ascertaining the mechanisms underlying these alterations would
have a high clinical impact, especially to enhance early intervention to alter the trajectory of intellectual
development in which no definitive treatments are available."
10810779,"Project Summary/Abstract
One of the biggest challenges in rare disease is accuracy and timeliness of patient diagnosis. On average it
takes 6 years for an accurate diagnosis, delaying treatment and creating substantial burden at the levels of
individual, familial and healthcare systems with an estimated $750 billion spent on unnecessary procedures.
Misdiagnosis also widens inequalities further, as misdiagnosis is more common among women and people of
color. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve diagnosis. Genetic risk predictions can improve diagnosis,
with particular clinical utility in the specific setting where large barriers to diagnosis exist, such as rare sleep
disorders. The rare sleep disorders narcolepsy and circadian rhythm sleep wake disorders face large hurdles
to diagnosis, where 20% of primary care physicians are unaware that sleep medicine exists as a specialty,
routine screening for sleep disorders is nearly absent, diagnostic tests require overnight visits to a limited
number of specialized clinics, and insurance coverage for common diagnostic tests is non-existent. In contrast
to the current diagnostic landscape for sleep disorders, genetic risk prediction is relatively inexpensive and
easily accessible. In order to integrate genetic risk into the diagnosis and treatment pipeline, we must first
have genetic predictors of risk applicable across multiple ancestry groups, or we risk widening inequities in
healthcare further. To address the challenge of timely patient diagnosis in sleep disorders, we propose to
leverage large exome sequence repositories to generate rare variant risk scores, expand the current known
common polygenic scores to multiple genetic ancestries, and ultimately test the ability of both the rare and
common polygenic scores to predict risk of rare sleep and circadian disorders in a large-scale hospital
database with the goal to integrate flags in patient records."

is centered at the University of Chicago with the participation of investigators from the Northwestern University,
the University of Illinois at Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Technology, and the Medical College of Wisconsin.
Each institution has distinct scientific strengths yet shares a common interest in diabetes and related research.
The DRTC includes 147 members, a growth of 20% in the last 5 years, with a total annual direct research funding
of $124 million, of which $34 million comes from the NIDDK. The mission of the DRTC is to promote new
discoveries and enhance scientific progress by supporting cutting-edge basic and clinical research on the
etiology of diabetes and its complications with the goal of rapidly translating research findings into novel
strategies for the diagnosis prevention, treatment and cure of diabetes and related conditions. To this end, we
propose the following Aims:
 Aim 1. Create an intellectual and physical environment that supports important and innovative diabetes
research.
 Aim 2. Raise awareness and interest in fundamental and clinical diabetes research in the greater Chicago
area as well as nationally.
 Aim 3. Enhance diabetes research, education and training opportunities for patients, students, fellows,
scientists and clinicians.
 Aim 4. Attract and retain early-stage investigators and investigators new to diabetes research;
 Aim 5. Provide high quality core services that leverage funding and unique expertise and serve the
diabetes community locally, regionally and nationally.
 Aim 6. Connect researchers and foster interdisciplinary collaborations especially in emerging areas of
research, to catalyze new ideas and scientific approaches.
 Aim 7. Promote the translation of scientific discoveries from the bench to bedside to community to
improve public health.
 Aim 8. Participate actively in and contribute to the National Diabetes Research Center program.
The DRTC will achieve these goals through the support of Biomedical Research Cores in Cell Biology,
Physiology, and Genetics and Genomics (a Regional/National Resource), which provide cutting-edge and state-
of-the-art services; through a Pilot & Feasibility Program to attract early stage investigators and investigators
new to diabetes research; and through an Enrichment Program that promotes engagement, communication, and
the exchange of ideas among patients, students, scientists and clinicians."
10824406,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core provides administrative oversight to ensure smooth operation of Diabetes Research
and Training Center (DRTC). This includes oversight of the training and development of new diabetes
investigators though a Pilot & Feasibility grant program and enhancing, enriching and increasing awareness of
diabetes and diabetes-related issues in the greater Chicago area and nationally through the Enrichment
Program. Additionally, the Core provides fiscal and operational oversight of the Biomedical Research Cores of
the DRTC. The DRTC is an integral part of the Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Chicago, as
well as the diabetes community throughout the Chicagoland area. The line of authority for the DRTC leads
directly for the Dean of the Biological Sciences at the University of Chicago, who is responsible for selecting the
Director. The DRTC consists of co-Directors (Raghu G. Mirmira and Graeme I. Bell) and an Associate Director
(Louis H. Philipson), who are responsible for the day-to-day administration and the coordination and evaluation
of Center activities. They are aided by the Steering Committee comprised of DRTC leaders. The administrative
structure also includes an Internal Advisory Board comprised of institutional leaders and an External Advisory
Board comprised of investigators who are leaders in the field of diabetes research. The aims of the
Administrative Core are:
1. To create an administrative structure to provide Center advocacy and oversight to ensure the continued
evolution and support of its Research Base.
2. To provide financial management of the Center’s Research Core and Pilot & Feasibility Program activities and
to ensure compliance with institutional and governmental regulations
3. To administer the Enrichment Program for promoting communication and exchange of ideas among Center
members, trainees, and colleagues from other Centers whose work is relevant to that of the DRTC."
10824411,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CELL BIOLOGY CORE
Cell Biology has been a component of the DRTC since its inception in 1977. It has taken many forms over the
past 40 years, most recently focusing on studies of pancreatic islets and beta cells. However, in recent years
and, continuing in this application, the Cell Biology Core has been expanded to also include studies of
adipocytes, hepatocytes, and innate and adaptive immune cells from diabetic and non-diabetic humans and
mice. The Core provides a broad range of services in cell-based systems to elucidate the roles of islet endocrine
cells, adipocytes, hepatocytes and immune cells in health and disease with an emphasis of studies using primary
cells from humans and mice. In addition, with this renewal, the Core will provide sophisticated models in zebrafish
to study in vivo and in real time the effect of the diabetogenic environment (insulin resistance, insulin deficiency)
on metabolically active cells, including islets, hepatocytes, kidney cells, and innate immune cells. The Core
provides advice on study design, methods, and data interpretation. Because many of the techniques are new to
investigators, the Core also provides direct hands-on support and training to ensure the successful and timely
completion of experiments. This Core is centered at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at
Chicago. The two groups meet regularly and have developed standard operating procedures to ensure that
Users receive quality support for their studies. The Core also has an ongoing commitment to training and has
trained investigators, fellows, students and research technicians in the procedures of the Core. The Cell Biology
Core is an integral part of the DRTC, and thus synergizes with the Physiology Core by facilitating diabetes-based
research on primary cells and tissues from mice and humans. Moreover, it allows discoveries made in the
Genetics and Genomics Core to be tested in a biological context. The Aims of the Core are:
 1. To provide pancreatic islets, adipocytes, hepatocytes, and innate and adaptive immune cells (e.g.
macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells) from normal and diabetic humans, mice, and zebrafish, as well as insulinoma,
pre-adipocyte, and iPSC (from non-diabetic patients and patients with monogenic forms of diabetes) cell lines.
 2. To continuously improve new experimental approaches (e.g. use of cells derived from iPSCs) that can
provide better physiological and pathophysiological context for discovery.
 3. To actively promote interaction and collaboration among DRTC members and attract outside
investigators to the field of diabetes research by highlighting the advantages of diabetes-relevant experimental
systems for studies of cross-cutting themes and questions."
10824417,"PROJECT SUMMARY – GENETICS AND GENOMICS CORE
The Genetics and Genomics Core provides advice, services and hands-on-training to Diabetes Research and
Training Center (DRTC) investigators on the design and implementation of genetics and genomics studies in
diabetes/obesity-related research. The Core serves not only DRTC-affiliated investigators but also diabetes
investigators carrying out diabetes-related research throughout the United States and internationally. The same
technology making genomic variation information accessible to everyone requires increasingly sophisticated
analytic strategies that are not in the repertoire of most investigators, including the analysis and interpretation of
genetic studies of diabetes and identification of diabetes-associated variants and predicted functionality of those
variants. The Core also maintains the Monogenic Diabetes Registry that provides clinical and genetic data on
more than 3,966 individuals from 1,971 families with a suspected genetic form of diabetes. It includes 482 with
known cause MODY and 221 with neonatal as well as 29 patients with rare syndromic forms of diabetes. The
Monogenic Diabetes Registry represents not only a resource that can be and is being used for longitudinal
studies of these genetic forms of diabetes but is also a living biobank for cell biological and physiological studies.
The expanding biobanks includes PBMCs from 21 patients and five iPSC lines. The growing awareness of the
role of genetics as a primary cause of diabetes among patients and physicians has led the Core to become a
national resource for genetic testing and interpretation of genetic testing results. The specific Aims of the
Genetics and Genomics Core are to provide advice, training and service:
 1. In the design, conduct and interpretation of genetic studies of diabetes and to make available specialized
 analytic tools taking advantage of cloud-based computing platforms (PrediXcan suite of analytic tools).
 2. For monogenic diabetes genes mutation screening locally, regionally and nationally and consultation
 regarding implications of the test. This includes maintaining the Monogenic Diabetes Registry, a clinical
 and genetic resource and living biobank.
 3. In genomic-based technologies in diabetes research, including generation of patient-specific cells
 (iPSCs) and animal models using BAC recombineering, transgenics, genome editing and other
 technologies; analysis of the epigenome and epitranscriptome and non-coding sequencing for functional
effects.
 4. For digital PCR services as a means to sensitively measure absolute levels of nucleic acids from tissues,
 cell and circulation (serum/plasma). These studies are also carried out using expertise in Cell Biology
 and Physiology Cores, where tissues and plasma samples often originate.
The Genetics and Genomics Core integrates with the other Biomedical Research Cores by providing samples
and data from patients with specific genetic forms of diabetes to the Cell Biology and Physiology Cores."
10824424,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PHYSIOLOGY CORE
Physiological research in humans and animal models has been an integral part of the Chicago Diabetes
Research and Training Center (DRTC) since its inception. The mission of the Physiology Core is to provide
DRTC investigators with the tools and knowledge necessary to investigate the pathophysiology of diabetes and
its effects on metabolically active tissues. An important evolution of this Core is the inclusion of detailed metabolic
phentopying services and circadian rhythm services based at Northwestern University. This new collaborative
working relationship between the University of Chicago and Northwestern University adds value to the DRTC by
providing access to an array of both state-of-the-art and unique resources, technology and services that are not
otherwise available through core facilities at any of the DRTC affiliated institutions. The long-range objectives
and goals of this Core are to understand the pathophysiology of diabetes and its complications. The Core serves
both experienced as well as novice users and functions as an important conduit for facilitating entry into the field
for investigators who have not traditionally performed metabolic physiology research. In addition to consultative
and experimental services, the Core provides training for investigators who wish to incorporate specialized
techniques back into their own lab. The Core provides advice and hands-on-training to investigators in clinical
studies of non-diabetic and diabetic humans, physiology studies of mice and mouse, mouse model generation,
and cellular physiology studies. The Specific Aims of the Core are to provide advice, training, and service in each
of the following areas:
1. Clinical studies of non-diabetic and diabetic human subjects.
2. Large-scale analysis of pancreatic beta-cell mass, islet size distribution, islet cellular composition and islet
vasculature in the human and mouse pancreas
3. Comprehensive metabolic phenotyping of mice.
4. Generation of specialized mouse models that span disorders of metabolism and glucose.
5. Cellular physiology services, including bioenergetic analyses, metabolic flux labeling, and measurement of
adenine nucleotides
6. Studies of the role of the microbiome on diabetes and obesity."
10824432,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PILOT & FEASIBILITY PROGRAM
The Pilot & Feasibility Program (P&F) of the Chicago DRTC has funded more than 175 grants to more than 165
investigators since its inception in 1977. In the past 10 year reporting period, 46 applications were funded,
including 27 from investigators located at affiliated institutions outside the University of Chicago. 34 of these 46
recipients (75%) received extramural funding as a result of P&F awards in the last 10 years, including 20 R01
awards, with a return on investment of nearly 10-fold. Thus, the P&F Program both assists investigators
throughout the Chicago area in diabetes-related studies and also serves as a catalyst for obtaining new,
independent funding from NIH and other extramural sources. The overall goal of the P&F Program is to provide
initial support to newly established investigators and to bring the expertise of more established investigators from
other fields into diabetes research. Proposals are sought each year from all Chicago-based institutions with
diabetes research programs. All proposals are evaluated by an internal and two external reviewers. Priority
scores and written reviews are then presented to the Steering Committee and funding decisions are made. A
second year of funding is possible for those investigators who have made significant documented progress on
their proposed research. All P&F grant recipients are required to attend and strongly encouraged to present their
findings at the Annual Chicago Diabetes Day held at the University of Chicago or Diabetes & Obesity Research
Day at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The vast majority of P&F grants recipients have remained in diabetes
research. The Aims of the P&F Program are:
 1. To fund P&F studies encompassing basic, translational, and clinical research into the causes of diabetes
 and its complications as well as potential new directions for the treatment of diabetes.
 2. To support new investigators, established investigators new to the field of diabetes research or
 established diabetes researchers who wish to start a novel direction for their research.
 3. To solicit P&F applications from researchers throughout the Chicagoland area, including the University
 of Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Illinois at Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology,
 Loyola University, Rosalind Franklin University and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Collaborative
 projects involving researchers at more than one University are specifically encouraged.
The P&F program remains an integral part of promoting diabetes research throughout the greater Chicago area
and has greatly enhanced the visibility of the DRTC program at participating institutions."
10806956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite rollout of Universal Test-and-Treat (UTT) in Africa, HIV incidence has declined only modestly with no
country on track to meet UNAIDS 2030 targets for epidemic control. Control efforts are challenged by both
“hard-to-engage” HIV-positive persons who remain viremic as well as HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) which has
prompted the recent rollout of dolutegravir (DTG). While UTT and DTG are likely to result in lower levels of
viremia and HIVDR, there is uncertainty about the magnitude and durability of their population-level impact.
Provision of UTT and DTG has been disrupted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda and the social
distancing and mobility restrictions implemented to contain transmission. Here, we propose the Longitudinal
Viral Load and Epidemiological Watch (LONGVIEW) Study, a prospective assessment of the impact of COVID-
19 disruption on UTT and DTG programmatic outcomes, including durable population viral load suppression,
HIVDR, and HIV incidence in southcentral Uganda. This study will be nested within the Rakai Community
Cohort Study (RCCS), a population-based study of ~20,000 persons, aged 15-49, in 40 communities with HIV
prevalence ranging from ~9-40% and transmitted HIVDR ~20%. We propose to measure viral loads and
perform deep sequence viral phylogenetics on all HIV-seropositive participants over seven RCCS surveys
(n~3800 HIV+ per survey) from 2013-2025, spanning introduction of UTT in 2017, DTG in 2019 and COVID-19
in 2020. In Aim 1, ~18,500 HIV viral loads will be determined for all HIV-positive RCCS participants at all study
visits. Group-based multi-trajectory analysis will be used to assess viral load suppression over time and deep
sequence phylogenetic data from all viremic participants (>1,000 HIV copies/mL) will assess HIVDR. In Aim 2,
we will use quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HIV treatment seeking,
utilization, and care provision. Specifically, we will identify HIV-positive individuals who report interruptions in
HIV care and conduct in-depth interviews to assess the extent and nature of ART care disruption. We will also
conduct focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with HIV service providers to assess the impact of
COVID-19 on provision of HIV care and treatment. In Aim 3, we will evaluate trends in HIV incidence and risk
of HIV transmission across the infection and care continuum before and after COVID-19 emergence. We will
use longitudinal RCCS data to estimate HIV incidence as well as HIV transmission risk within household-based
partnerships. Deep sequence viral phylogenetic data will be used to reconstruct directed transmission
networks and estimate the attributable fraction of transmissions across the care continuum. This study will
provide empirical data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population HIV virologic and incidence
outcomes in a “real-world” programmatic setting. The overarching goal of this study is to measure the
impact of COVID-19 on UTT services, longer-term HIV viremia, drug resistance, and HIV incidence to inform
HIV control and elimination strategies in Africa."
10843724,"ABSTRACT Imaging Core
Large scale knee imaging in MOST, including from MRI, radiographs and dual energy CT (DECT), has catalyzed
insights into the evolution of structural disease and the relation of structural pathology to joint pain in OA. In the
MOST4 program, expanded use of new imaging modalities including low-dose weight bearing CT of the lower
limb and DECT will add to the richness of these assessments. Deriving valid insights from these imaging
modalities requires attention to the quality of the images acquired and similar focus on the analysis and
processing of the imaging data. The Imaging Core will provide for all of these imaging modalities rigorous
oversight of the quality of the images and of the information gleaned from them. In doing so, the Imaging Core
will enrich immeasurably insights provided by MOST4. The overall goals of the Imaging Core for MOST4 are to:
1) ensure the high quality and completeness of images acquired by the clinical centers, including 1.5T MRI of
the knee (at MOST4 V1 and V2), and a group of images at MOST4 V1, including hand X-rays and weight-bearing
CT of the knees and other lower limb joints, and ultrasound and DECT of the knee; 2) oversee the reading
centers to ensure the high quality of data derived from the images; 3) and provide analysis ready reading center
data and images needed for all four MOST4 Projects and other approved MOST projects. The Imaging Core will
achieve these goals by adapting and updating methods honed and successfully applied during the past 19 years
over three funding cycles of MOST. By achieving these goals, the Imaging Core will ensure that MOST4 has the
high-quality joint imaging data that is essential to achieving a deeper understanding of the role of specific joint
structures in OA pathogenesis, of the inter-relationship between changes in different structures and how they
are in turn related to joint symptoms. The Imaging Core will also use deep learning methods to combine data
from MOST3 DECT and MRI images for exploratory analyses of the role of intra-articular crystals in co-localized
cartilage loss."
10843730,"ABSTRACT Project 2: Synovial Fluid Proteomics (previously Project 4)
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a leading cause of physical disability in older
individuals. There are no approved pharmacologic treatments available beyond those for symptomatic relief and
no biomarkers available to assess disease status or risk of progression. Major reasons for this may include key
differences between blood and intra-articular biomarkers and the dominating influence of biomechanics that
makes it difficult to differentiate systemic from mechanical contributions to OA. There may be differences
between single-site knee and multi-site OA that occurs in hands and knees since the latter may result from
systemic initiation rather than joint-specific factors. Assessment of proteins in joint-specific synovial fluid that is
in direct contact with joint tissues and paired blood plasma may provide insights into joint-specific and systemic
factors in OA. The proposed study will fill a gap in knowledge about the pathobiology of knee and multi-site OA.
The objective of this proposal is to identify novel OA biology underlying knee and multi-site OA using proteomic
analyses of paired synovial fluid and blood plasma. Our central hypothesis is that there are molecular signatures
in synovial fluid and blood plasma that can be used to identify biomarkers for OA and which differentiate systemic
from joint-specific molecular contributors to OA. Our long-term goal is to identify biomarkers that assess OA
burden and disease progression and that provide insights into disease pathogenesis. We will assess returning
participants from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), a well-characterized prospective cohort of older
individuals aged 54-86 years to assess risk factors for incidence and progression of knee OA. All participants
will undergo radiographic assessments for hand and knee OA at MOST4 Visit 1. Synovial fluid will be collected
in those who have at least 1 ml of synovial fluid present on knee ultrasound (~500 participants), which will include
those with and without frequent knee pain. We will measure proteins in ~500 paired synovial fluid and blood
plasma samples using SOMAScan, an aptamer-based proteomics assay that simultaneously detects ~7,000
proteins. Proteomic findings in MOST will be replicated in an international consortium, STEpUP OA, which
includes ~1,800 individuals from 5 cohorts with proteomic profiling in synovial fluid and plasma. Aim 1 will identify
proteins in knee OA synovial fluid and plasma associated cross-sectionally with knee pain and MRI-detected
cartilage damage. Aim 2 will identify proteins in knee OA synovial fluid and plasma associated with longitudinal
worsening of knee pain or MRI-detected cartilage damage over 24 months. Aim 3 will identify proteins in plasma
associated with multi-site OA. The expected outcome of this proposal is identification of proteomic signatures
that underlie OA pathogenesis. This will be the first and largest study of paired OA synovial fluid and plasma
proteomics, which will likely provide novel insights into joint-specific and systemic contributions to OA
pathophysiology needed to identify novel biomarkers and suggest new treatment strategies for OA."
10774192,"Project Summary:
Women comprise 10% of the U.S. Veteran population, expected to rise to 35% by 2035.1, 2 37% of female
Veterans report risky or problem alcohol use4, and many have complex comorbidity requiring specialized
treatment5 but only 2% of women Veterans receive treatment in VA Substance Use Disorder (SUD) clinics.
There is currently no evidence-based, Veteran-centric, female segregated treatment with female-specific
programming for AUD or SUD at the VA. The vast majority of women at the V.A. are limited to gender-
neutral treatments for AUD in Specialty SUD clinics, which is a mixed gender setting and is unappealing to
women Veterans6. Only 19%7 to 30%8 of VAs offer female-only SUD treatments, and these are offered in
Specialty SUD clinics, and do not contain women-specific content shown to be crucial for efficacy9. Since
women are likely to seek AUD care with their Primary Care (PC) Providers10, 11, and women Veterans report
preference for PC colocation of AUD services12, PC is a promising setting to reduce treatment entry barriers,
increase access to care and outcome efficacy for AUD among women Veterans. This R01 resubmission, “A
Female-Specific Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Group for Alcohol Use Disorder in VA Primary Care
Settings,” in response to PA-19-055, and NOT-AA-19-010, proposes a Hybrid Type 118 study to adapt a
single-gender group modality Female-Specific CBT developed for civilian females with AUD19-22, 41, and to
test the new Veteran-Centric female-specific CBT group (FS-CBT) in VA PC at New York Harbor Healthcare
System (NYHHS) VA, compared to Usual Care (UC) for AUD in PC. FS-CBT is a unique 12-session weekly
group CBT treatment for AUD, providing: 1. AUD interventions; 2. general female specific content; 3.
female-Veteran content; 4. wellness and self-care; and 5. a novel 24/7 social support for abstinence
discussion mobile app. Aim 1. RCT (n=162) testing FS-CBT+UC for AUD in PC compared to UC only in PC
for women Veterans, with baseline and 3-, 9-, 15- month assessments. UC will be delivered by grant-funded
PCP staff to ensure fidelity. H.1a.Women VA PC patients in FS-CBT+UC for AUD at a PC site will be more
likely to access and engage in treatment for AUD than women in UC. H.1b. Women in FS-CBT+UC will have
better drinking and secondary outcomes than women in UC only. H.1c. Outcomes in FS-CBT+UC vs UC
will be mediated by social support, AUD medication, coping skills, and subjective distress. Aim 2.
Formative evaluation of FS-CBT with 20 women Veterans in FS-CBT, 20 in UC, 15 who did not enroll, and
16 PC providers, using “Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research” will be done.
This project is consistent with NIAAA priorities for behavioral and health services, and Advancing Science
for the Health of Women: Trans-NIH Strategic Plan24, and the VA Strategic Plan25 to focus resources more
efficiently and improve timeliness of services. The long-term objective is to produce an “off the shelf”
treatment to fill a gap in evidence-based, accessible, patient-centered AUD treatment for women Veterans."
10836468,"The Yale Diabetes Research Center (Yale DRC) was established in 1993 with the goal of promoting research
in diabetes and related metabolic disorders at Yale. The Yale DRC brings together a multidisciplinary group of
97 members and professional supporting staff, new investigators and research trainees from 20 departments
and 4 colleges or schools at Yale. The scope of the research activities of the membership is very broad, ranging
from basic molecular biology to whole body physiology and the treatment of diabetic patients. The members,
however, share a common interest in research that is related to diabetes and disorders of metabolism or is
fundamental to understanding its pathogenesis or for the development of new treatment strategies. The design
of the Yale DRC is aimed at developing an infrastructure that could serve as a catalyst to stimulate innovative
diabetes and metabolic-related research. The cornerstone of the Yale DRC is its five Research Cores that
provide funded basic and clinical investigators with the opportunity to more efficiently utilize resources and
expand the scope of their research programs. The Clinical Metabolism and the Diabetes Translational
Research Cores facilitate metabolic research in patients, whereas the Molecular Genetics Mouse Core,
Physiology and Cell Biology Cores that comprise the more basic science focus of the Yale DRC offer
investigators the tools to create and test novel animal models starting from the molecule and ending with
biological outcomes. The principal functions of the Yale DRC Administrative Core are: 1) Administrative and
Financial Management, 2) Provision of Research Support Services, 3) Administration of the Pilot and Feasibility
Project Program, 4) Provision of a Scientific Enrichment Program and a Yale DRC Vibrant Program to
promote diversity in diabetes research. The overarching goals of the Yale DRC Administrative Core is to enable
the Yale DRC to meet its mission to: 1) stimulate multidisciplinary interactions, particularly between basic and
clinical scientists at Yale; 2) encourage established Yale investigators not presently working in diabetes-related
areas, to bring their expertise to bear on problems relevant to diabetes and metabolism; 3) efficiently organize
time consuming and/or costly techniques through Yale DRC Core facilities to enhance the productivity of
investigators conducting research in diabetes related areas; 4) promote new research programs through pilot
feasibility projects; 5) enhance the quality of research training of future Yale DRC members, and 6) create a
stimulating institutional environment that enhances research efforts by its members to develop new strategies to
prevent and treat diabetes and related metabolic disorders at the local and national level. Thus, the Yale DRC
provides the infrastructure to support a wide spectrum of clinical and basic scientists who are working
collaboratively to understand why diabetes develops, and to translate discoveries from the bench to the bedside
and ultimately to create new strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes."
10836471,"The Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core provides comprehensive support for investigators conducting clinical
investigations of human diseases of metabolism such as diabetes. The primary emphasis of this core is to
provide analytical resources for patient-oriented studies utilizing stable isotopes to determine metabolic flux at
the whole body and tissue specific levels. Secondarily, the core also makes its analytical resources available to
researchers utilizing rat and cell models of human metabolic diseases. Stable isotopes offer unique advantages
over traditional radioisotopic methods for assessing substrate turnover in humans as they do not expose subjects
to ioniziing radiation and they provide positional isotopomer information that can be used to assess flux through
critical metabolic pathways. The major limitation to the use of stable isotopes by the clinical investigator is the
need for sophisticated and expensive instrumentation and highly skilled expertise for instrument operation and
for data analysis and interpretation. The Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core removes these obstacles by
providing the personnel and resources needed for the extraction, purification, derivatization, and instrumental
analysis needed to determine the concentrations and isotopic enrichments of metabolites in plasma, urine, or
tissues. This core measures the isotopic (e.g., 2H, 13C, 15N, and 18O) enrichment and concentrations of over 140
intermediary metabolites by GC-MS, LC/MS/MS, and NMR for the calculation of turnover of carbohydrates, lipids,
and proteins. The primary purposes of the Yale-DRC Clinical Metabolism Core are to: 1) make GC-MS, LC-
MS/MS, and multinuclear NMR analyses available to Yale DRC members, 2) avoid duplication of costs
associated with personnel and instrumentation, 3) provide standardized protocols to insure consistent and
accurate sample analysis, 4) assist Yale DRC researchers in the design and interpretation of experiments
utilizing stable isotopes for measurement of metabolic flux, 5) develop new methodology in response to the
emerging research needs of Yale DRC members."
10836476,"The overall goal of this Core is to support and advance diabetes-related research through the generation
of unique, genetically-modified mutant mouse models. We currently provide a number of highly specialized
services contained within two tightly integrated Subcores: 1) the Molecular Subcore designs and generates
gene expression constructs and CRISPR tools for genetic modification in mice and cultured cell lines, provides
genotyping design/ mutation characterization, gene mapping/ localization and the quantitation of gene
expression by quantitative RT-PCR, and 2) the Gene Targeting Subcore generates genetically-modified mouse
models in a variety of standard strains (such as C57BL/6, Balb/c, etc.) and specialized genetic backgrounds
(including NOD and various immunodeficient strains, such as Rag/Il2rg KOs) via CRISPR/Cas9 approaches,
conventional transgenesis and ES cell recombination methods, and also provides sperm cryopreservation and
IVF recovery of preserved strains. The specific aims of the Molecular Genetic Mouse Core are therefore to
provide the following: a) critical services, b) technical assistance, c) experimental design, consultation/ advice,
troubleshooting, d) training and e) equipment and resources, centered around the generation of genetically-
modified mouse models by a variety of both traditional and CRISPR-related methods, including knock-outs,
conditional knockouts, inducible knockouts, conditional gene activation, and a variety of knock-ins (tags,
reporters, mutations and exon/domain or whole gene replacements).
 The MGM Core has successfully generated a great many lines of genetically-modified mice related to
diabetes studies, most recently using CRISPR-based technology, and its continuing focus on technological
development will ensure that services to the diabetes community remain cutting-edge. In addition, a unique
feature of this core is that the interests of the subcore directors have fueled a critical mass of resources for
investigation of the rapidly developing research areas of the mechanistic relationships between gut microbiota,
inflammasome biology and obesity, NAFLD, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The MGM Core has developed
mouse models with ablated or altered genes involved in regulation of the innate immune system, including
NOD-like receptor proteins, Toll-like receptors, guanylate binding proteins, the apolipoprotein L family, and
various interleukins and caspases. Finally, the core has a continuing investment in extending and improving
the development and application of technologies for humanization of the mouse genome for engraftment of
CD34+ human HSC, and the reconstitution of a human hematopoietic and immune system. These “humanized”
mouse models will be invaluable tools for the dissection of the genetic components regulating the immunologic
and metabolic responses in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, especially with respect to human disease."
10781925,"The overall goal of this project is to determine if the IKAROS transcription factor regulates a program that
maintains IL-4 receptor (IL-4R)-mediated B-cell quiescence to ribonuclear protein (RNP) autoantigens
(autoAgs). We propose that B cell activation through the type I interferon (IFN)/TLR7 activation pathway is
inhibited by this B-cell quiescence program. We also propose that failure to maintain B cell quiescence is
associated with the development of RNP autoantibody in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our
preliminary data suggest that in both lupus mice and in human SLE, multiple immune disease phenotypes can
be initiated by loss of quiescence at the earliest stage of B cell development; that is, the transitional B cell. The
key forces that promote quiescence is an IKAROS (or IKZF1)-based program that is sustained through IL-4R
signaling on IgD+CD23+ B cells. The major opposing program that promotes loss of quiescence is mediated
through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling, assembly and signaling competency of the TLR7
pathway, and development of B cells that can produce autoantibodies. We hypothesize that early-stage loss
of quiescence leads to a series of B cell development defects after the transitional stage involving progression
from a resting naïve to an activated naïve predominance and then to development of the pathogenic
CD11c+Tbet+IgD−CD27− double negative 2 (DN2) or germinal center (GC) B cells that ultimately lead to the
development of RNP autoantibody producing plasmablasts and plasma cells (PB/PC). In Aim 1, we will use
several knockout and knock-in mouse strategies in lupus prone mice to determine if type I IFN and IL-4 act at
the Tr B cells to regulate autoreactive B cell development and survival. The specific effects of Ikaros in
modulating type I IFN and IL-4 signaling-mediated RNP-reactive B-cell quiescence at the Tr and naïve stage
will also be analyzed. In Aim 2, we will determine if SLE patients exhibit a loss of IL-4R/IKZF1-mediated B cell
quiescence program starting at the Tr stage of B-cell development. We will determine if the loss of this
pathway disrupts B-cell tolerance to type I IFN and TLR7 stimulation, leading to the development of RNP-
reactive DN2 B cells and PB/PC. The innovative scientific basis of this proposal will be its ability to interpret
the broad spectrum of immune and disease characteristics of SLE by understanding the key initiating events of
loss of B cell quiescence at the transitional stage. B cells from mouse models of lupus and from SLE subjects
will be characterized by high dimension flow cytometry and transcriptomics analyses for well-established cell
surface protein antigen markers that define B cell development at all major developmental stages. We have
established a team of coordinators at the BVAMC to facilitate recruitment and have acquired numbers of SLE
subjects necessary for definitive and statistically meaningful results. A state-of-the-art immunologic laboratory
and BVAMC flow cytometry facility that includes the latest FACS analysis and sorting equipment, as well as a
dedicated BVAMC 10X single-cell analysis facility, and analytical pipeline for bioinformatics analysis of the
results are established. Significance: The successful conclusion of these experiments will be the development
of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. From a diagnostic approach, the key defining phenotype of
quiescent versus non-quiescent B cells can be economically and easily measured using standard clinical
laboratory flow cytometry equipment with a relatively low number of cell surface (such as IL-4R or IFNAR1) or
intracellular factors (such as intracellular IFNβ, TLR7, or IKAROS). This could be extended to analyze
trajectories of abnormal B cell development that result from the loss of B cell quiescence at the earliest stages
to understand therapeutics that may be beneficial in subjects who have acquired SLE in the past. At the very
minimum, such approaches should enable the studies and types of treatments that will promote the
maintenance of B cell quiescence and in effect, force SLE into a state of remission which can be maintained
once the causes of the immune or environmental factors that disrupt such remission are defined."
10830268,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Precision Psychiatry is an emerging approach that considers patients’ characteristics to customize prevention
and treatment for serious mental illness. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) is the largest and most
comprehensive biobank in the world, currently involving multi-ancestry genetic data from more than 650,000
Veterans and highly dense electronic health record information that fully captures the clinical characteristics of
each participant. Given the high prevalence of serious mental illness among our Veterans, MVP provides a
unique opportunity to perform large-scale genetic discovery that will further our understanding of the
pathophysiology of serious mental illness and promote Precision Psychiatry. While well-powered genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple risk variants across serious mental illness, there have been
limited conclusive findings on the functional relevance of most discovered loci due to small effect size, overlap
with non-coding regions of the genome and unclear mechanisms through which they act. Our group and others
have shown that a large portion of phenotypic variability in disease risk can be explained by regulatory variants
with cell type specificity, i.e. genetic variants that affect epigenetic mechanisms and the expression levels of
genes. Studying gene expression and epigenome changes directly in MVP samples is not feasible as such data
are not available. To overcome these limitations, we propose to take advantage of large-scale datasets with
genotyping and multiscale molecular profiling that our group and others have generated in human brain tissue
and apply machine learning approaches to directly impute genome-wide transcriptomes, epigenomes and
proteomes in MVP samples using the existing MVP genotypes. The primary goals of our project are threefold:
First, imputed MVP transcriptomes, epigenomes and proteomes will be meta-analyzed to single tissue-specific
gene dysregulation scores for each individual via a novel method, called PolyXcan, which leverages a data-
driven correlation-aware meta-analytical framework and performs joint multi-omics-wide association studies. For
each serious mental illness, key gene drivers and molecular pathways will be identified with a structured,
interpretable deep learning approach and gene-gene interaction effects by leveraging patient subtypes identified
with semi-supervised graph-based cluster methods; both of these approaches are only possible with well-
powered individual-level (genotypic and phenotypic) data of the scale that exists in MVP and we expect them to
enhance efforts for gene target prioritization and drug discovery. Second, imputed gene dysregulation for each
individual in MVP will be integrated with perturbagen reference libraries (describing the effect of therapeutic
compounds on gene expression) to identify the extent to which compounds could be therapeutic by antagonizing
the predicted gene dysregulation. We have validated this approach to summary level data (from GWAS) in a
wide range of disorders (autoimmune, neuropsychiatric and COVID-19). Here we propose to use the same
approach at the individual level to determine whether genetics can be utilized to rank potential treatments and
predict the ones that achieve better outcomes. Third, the scale of data generation and its integration into
predictive models will provide a wealth of data that will be made available to the MVP scientific community for
other diseases beyond the immediate goals of this proposal that have the potential to increase our understanding
of Precision Psychiatry. Successful completion of our study would have an enormous impact on our Veterans
since, in addition to the tremendous burden of suffering and economic costs, serious mental illness increases
the mortality rate among Veterans."
10750999,"SUMMARY
Habituation is the progressive decline in responses to repeated exposure to the same, homotypic stressor. It
is highly conserved and observed in species ranging from humans to rodents. Habituation is adaptive because
it allows animals to filter out irrelevant stimuli and focus selectively on important stimuli, thereby facilitating
optimal responding in a complex and changing environment. The ability to habituate to repeated cognitive
stressors is disrupted in several psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). In previous work, we identified sex differences in habituation in adult rats. While male
rats habituate to 5 days of 30min restraint/day, as indicated by reductions in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) activity and behavior on the 5th compared to the 1st day, female rats do not habituate to 5 days of
restraint. We showed that elevations in orexinergic expression and activity in adult females compared to adult
males contribute to this disrupted habituation in females. The elevations in orexin mRNA in adult females are
dependent on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at the prepro-orexin promoter. However, little is known
about orexin functions in adolescence. In preliminary data, we show that adolescent male and female rats
do not habituate to 5 days of repeated restraint and that male adolescents exhibit higher basal circulating
glucocorticoids than adult males. They also exhibit higher orexin expression that do adult males. Together,
the findings in adult and adolescent rats suggest that higher orexin expression and activity in adolescent
males and females may be promoted by elevated glucocorticoids and lead to disrupted habituation. The
posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is an important site mediating habituation, is densely innervated
by orexins and orexins act in the pPVT to regulate responses to chronic stress such as facilitation. These
data lead to the central hypothesis that elevations in orexin expression and activity in both adolescent
males and females are promoted by glucocorticoids and that elevations in orexin neurotransmission
in the pPVT disrupt habituation in adolescence. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that increased GR
binding at the prepro-orexin promoter in adolescent males and females elevates orexin expression. Specific
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that elevations in orexin activity in the pPVT of adolescent male and female
rats disrupt neuroendocrine and behavioral habituation. Experiments will use DREADDs or virally-mediated
knockdown of orexin receptors to inhibit orexin activity in the pPVT. We expect that inhibition of orexin activity
in the pPVT will promote habituation in both male and female adolescent rats. Together, the experiments will
provide the first information on orexin activity and functions during adolescence and provide
mechanistic insights as to why habituation is not observed in adolescence."
10763885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Post-translational regulation of histones and other chromatin-associated proteins is a major means by which
gene expression is modulated during normal and malignant development. Polycomb group proteins are essential
for proper development and are frequently altered in human cancers. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2
(PRC2) functions in a collaborative chromatin-based crosstalk with PRC1 and H3K27me3 to initiate and maintain
gene silencing. We have found that PRC2 catalysis of H3K27me3 is inhibited in pediatric gliomas by two
suspected tumor drivers: histone H3 K27M and EZHIP. Inhibition of PRC2 activity by K27M and EZHIP can result
in aberrant gene expression, cellular differentiation, and cell proliferation. Despite a substantial reduction in
H3K27 methylation levels caused by EZHIP or K27M, our work has revealed residual H3K27me3 at CpG islands
near promoters of known and suspected tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, evidence suggests that this
residual PRC2 activity plays a critical role in supporting tumorigenesis. This proposal seeks to leverage and
extend our preliminary findings to define the mechanisms by which K27M and EZHIP misregulate PRC2 to
promote tumorigenesis by employing a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates biochemical, genetic, and
genomic methods. Specifically, we will (1) define the role of aberrant PRC2 activity in promoting K27M and
EZHIP-containing tumors, (2) determine the mechanism of targeting PRC2 to CpG islands in gliomas, and (3)
define the mechanism of PRC2 inhibition by EZHIP. Expected results will help us formulate novel theories and
provide crucial mechanistic basis underlying the pathogenesis by oncohistones. The knowledge generated in
the course of this study will motivate future therapeutic efforts for treating pediatric gliomas."
10816605,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a highly common cause of death due to the development of cirrhosis and consequential life-threatening portal hypertension (PHTN). Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement is the gold standard to evaluate PHTN but not readily available in routine clinical settings due to its invasiveness and requirement of adequate operator skill and experience. Thus, an urgent need for a safe, reliable, operator-independent noninvasive method exists for diagnosing and monitoring PHTN to allow early targeted interventions. Biological soft tissues usually have a biphasic architecture, including a solid matrix (cells, extracellular matrix) saturated with fluid (interstitial fluid and blood). MR elastography (MRE) can quantitatively assess multiple tissue mechanical properties. Within them, liver stiffness, which comprises solid stress and fluid pressure, is widely used clinically to assess hepatic fibrosis as a liver biopsy alternative. 
Our prior studies show that MRE-assessed viscoelasticity can distinguish solid-related fibrosis and fluid-related inflammation in early-stage CLD. Other hepatosplenic MRE parameters (compressibility and nonlinearity) are promising biomarkers for hemodynamics-associated fluid pressure but require systematic evaluation. 
The overall goal of this work is to develop an advanced multiparametric 3D vector MRE (3DV MRE) technique of the liver and spleen for fully characterizing PHTN in advanced CLD. 
• In Aim 1, a dual-frequency, self-navigating, and hybrid radial-Cartesian 3DV MRE method will be developed for characterizing multiple mechanical properties in both small animals and human subjects. We will develop a model-based iterative reconstruction and a 3D neural network inversion to calculate viscoelasticity, compressibility, and nonlinearity in the liver and spleen from the hybrid 3DV MRE data. 
• In Aim 2, we will use 3DV MRE imaging on three PHTN rat models (diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (N=22), cirrhosis-induced PHTN after bile duct ligation surgery (N=22), and congestion-induced PHTN after partial inferior vena cava ligation surgery (N=22)). Technical integrity, scientific rigor, and diagnostic accuracy will be assessed by comparing multiple imaging biomarkers with in vivo interstitial fluid and portal pressure measurements, ex vivo dynamic mechanical analysis testing results, and histologic features. 
• Before the clinical translation, we will evaluate the repeatability of MRE biomarkers in 5 controls and 5 clinical patients using a test-retest strategy. Finally, a pilot clinical study in 10 controls and 50 clinical patients with endoscopy or HVPG will rigorously cross-validate the diagnostic accuracy of the PHTN predictors. 
Advanced 3DV MRE development enables other investigators and us to explore this promising technology for many other etiologies related to fluid pressure. This project’s success will also provide a valuable noninvasive assessment tool for emerging therapeutic interventions."

based smoking cessation interventions. These interventions appear to significantly increase quit rates in the
short term, but these reductions are not sustained beyond the incentive payment period. These results have
now been replicated in several large studies. In the orthopaedic trauma setting, however, the short-term
cessation in smoking may provide a unique opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Infection, nonunion and
soft tissue complications are likely the biggest clinical drivers of poor outcomes following orthopaedic trauma.
There is a fair amount of consensus in the field that smoking roughly doubles the risk of these complications,
and the vast majority of complications occur during the first six months following trauma. If smoking rates could
be reduced during this critical period, it is possible that incentive-based smoking cessation interventions may
significantly reduce complication rates.
The proposed study aims to examine the effectiveness of a multi-pronged smoking and tobacco cessation
intervention in combination with a patient incentive strategy in the reduction of complications following lower
extremity trauma. The study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of two approaches: (a) best practice
intervention (standard of care + inpatient face-to-face brief smoking counseling/motivational interviewing
coupled with direct enrollment in a state-based, standardized smoking cessation support program) and (b) best
practice intervention + patient incentives for smoking cessation. The goal of this proposed study is to provide
definitive evidence regarding the effectiveness of patient incentives for orthopedic trauma patients in reducing
complication rates and promoting smoking cessation. If successful, this cost effective and readily implemented
approach can be made available to trauma patients nationwide.
The primary outcome for this study will be a composite rate of major limb complication clearly linked to re-
hospitalization, or same day surgery and associated with smoking and tobacco use in the orthopaedic
literature: surgical site infection, nonunion, and wound dehiscence. In addition to the primary outcomes,
several secondary outcomes will be tracked to test the hypothesis associated with the study specific aims: (1)
Smoking cessation; (2) Participation in smoking cessation programs; (3) Patient Reported Outcome (PROs)
and Quality of Life; (4) Clinical Outcomes Associated with Smoking Cessation; (5) Patient reported satisfaction
with overall treatment; (6) Return to Usual Major Activity.
The study will also aim to examine the dose response relationship between the amount of patient incentives,
the rate of complications, and smoking cessation by implementing a randomized incentive architecture with five
sub-samples of patients receiving payments of varying amounts."
10802333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to environmental toxicants including pesticides causes dopamine (DA) neuron loss in the substantia
nigra (SN) and raises risk for developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). Toxicant exposure studies show sexually
dimorphic DA neuron resilience, such that females lose fewer DA neurons than males. This sex difference is
relevant since PD in women is less prevalent and has a later age of symptomatic onset. However, the
mechanisms for these sex differences in DA neuron resilience to toxicants remain poorly understood. We have
leveraged the respective advantages of fly and rodent models of DA neurodegeneration to provide new insights
into toxicants’ effects on selective DA neuron resilience, which we have translated to human postmortem brain
tissue from PD patients. We identified the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 in mammals and its
Drosophila ortholog dVGLUT as modulators of sex differences in DA neuron resilience. We find: 1)
dVGLUT/VGLUT2+ DA neurons are likelier to survive insults versus DA neurons that do not express the
transporter; 2) Conditional dVGLUT/VGLUT2 knockout in DA neurons increases vulnerability to insults; and 3)
dVGLUT/VGLUT2 expression is upregulated in surviving DA neurons in response to PD-linked insults including
aging, misfolded a-synuclein, and neurotoxins. Furthermore, we discovered females express more
dVGLUT/VGLUT2 in DA neurons compared to males – a finding conserved across flies, rodents and humans
that may explain the sex differences in PD. Yet, whether sex differences in DA neuron VGLUT2 expression
contribute to resilience to environmental toxicants like rotenone and paraquat remains unknown. Thus, we
hypothesize DA neuron dVGLUT/VGLUT2 expression is part of a conserved, sexually dimorphic neuroprotective
response to DA neuron injury by environmental toxicants in PD. To test our hypothesis, we developed
comparative approaches across flies, rodents and postmortem human brain, along with new genetic and imaging
tools, to determine whether VGLUT2 modulates sex differences in DA neuron resilience to the pesticide rotenone
(Aim 1). We will also determine the mechanisms for dVGLUT- and VGLUT2-mediated resilience to pesticides in
males and females (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine DA neuron VGLUT2 expression in brains of male and
female PD patients, including in brains of subjects with known exposure to the pesticide heptachlor (Aim 3).
Identifying VGLUT2’s roles in sex differences in DA neuron resilience as a result of environmental toxicant
exposure may provide new insights into PD. Moreover, determining the mechanisms of increased DA neuron
resilience in females can be transferred to males to boost DA neuron survival in PD. This may ultimately lead to
new, effective treatments to either slow or stop PD neurodegeneration in both men and women."

Bilingualism may protect against cognitive and brain changes in both healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD) through enhanced executive functioning, arising from the need to constantly
manage two or more languages. However, studies have yielded mixed results, and there remains an unknown
role of bilingualism in 1) resistance to the development of neuropathology and in 2) resilience, the maintenance
of cognition and/or brain structure in the presence of neuropathology burden. Further research to clarify the
protective role of bilingualism in aging and ADRD is crucial and highly relevant, considering that over half of the
world’s population and more than 20% of the US population speak two or more languages. This proposal will
help clarify the role of bilingualism in healthy aging and in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) by addressing the
nuances underlying bilingualism, sociocultural factors, executive functioning, and dementia diagnoses. We
hypothesize that bilingualism contributes to resistance and resilience through both network-specific (language
and executive functioning) and domain-general effects, and its impact is moderated by bilingualism and
sociocultural factors, type of executive functioning task, and AD variant. Our long-term goal is to develop a
framework for bilingualism’s influence on resistance and resilience. We will leverage a well-characterized,
prospectively studied cohort of monolingual and bilingual speakers at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center
who span the range of healthy aging (N = 200) and AD variants (N = 400). This cohort is unique in its scope of
longitudinal (2+ timepoints) neuropsychological, bilingualism/sociocultural, neuroimaging, and AD biomarker
data. In Aim 1, we will determine which aspects of bilingualism contribute to a protective effect on executive
functioning. We will group healthy aging and AD variant bilingual speakers based on bilingualism and
sociocultural factors and assess for differences on cognitive measures and neuroimaging findings. In Aims 2
and 3, we will determine if bilingualism is associated with resistance and resilience by comparing monolingual
and bilingual speakers within healthy aging and AD variant groups. We will test for differences between groups
in grey matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) integrity (Aim 2) and AD proteinopathy (Aim 3) and
correlate the findings with performance on cognitive measures. We are well-suited to complete these aims
given our exceptional multidisciplinary team with expertise in the neural underpinnings of language, clinical
phenotyping of aging and AD, cognitive resilience, and multimodal imaging. Accomplishing these aims will
significantly impact the field of ADRD research by give important insight into the neural basis of bilingualism
and its influence on the trajectory of healthy aging and ADRD, thereby improving care for individuals with
diverse language backgrounds."
10899430,"Project Summary / Abstract
Achieving optimal health in the United States is challenging, in part due to inequities in social determinants of
health (SDoH) like financial security, experiences of discrimination, and healthcare access. These biases may
manifest in the data collected during health care in electronic health records (EHRs) and, in turn, be
propagated in research and healthcare activities that use those data. In other words, real-world data will reflect
real-world biases and inequities. A biased healthcare system will produce biased data. Analyses performed
with biased data will produce biased results. The end result is that without appropriate understanding and
intervention, these biases will perpetuate themselves, ultimately furthering inequity in health and healthcare.
Increasingly, healthcare delivery has become reliant on clinical risk prediction and risk assessment algorithms
that use EHR data to help identify patients who are at-risk, allocate health system resources, and inform
healthcare decisions. Even if these algorithms are designed to be equally valid for all patients, if they are
applied to biased data the results will also be biased. In order to improve equity in health and healthcare, it is
vital that we understand biases in EHR data that are associated with social determinants of health and develop
methods that can ensure that risk prediction algorithms produce valid results for all patients. Therefore, the
objectives of the proposed work are to:
1) Characterize the patterns of bias in EHR data
2) Identify latent and observed factors that drive mechanisms of poor data quality
3) Evaluate the impact of data bias on clinical tasks that rely on EHR data
4) Evaluate structural modeling and debiasing methods to improve analyses conducted with EHR-derived
datasets that contain bias.
We will be working with data from OCHIN, a large community-based practice network, which provided care for
approximately 1.8 million unique patients between 2018 and 2020. First, we will identify associations between
SDoH and EHR data quality. Second, we will evaluate the accuracy of a set of representative clinical risk
prediction and risk assessment algorithms to characterize the relationship between EHR data quality, algorithm
performance, and SDoH. Finally, using structural models and the relationships defined in the first two aims, we
will model the performance of clinical risk prediction and assessment algorithms in the EHR, and we will
examine strategies for incorporating SDoH information to improve their accuracy and support appropriate
clinical decision-making at the point of care."
10757448,"Project Summary
 The mesocorticostriatal network is central to adaptive reward processes, as well as diseases of
dysfunctional learning, motivation, and cognition. As learning progresses, there is a transition from initial
reliance on nucleus accumbens (NAC) to later recruitment of dorsolateral striatum (DLS), which drives a shift
from goal-directed behavior to more automatic behaviors characterized by rapid, stimulus-driven movement
sequences. This transition is thought to involve a network of recurrent loops, including dense dopaminergic
(DA) input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra (SNC) and glutamatergic input from cortex.
Critically, however, the contributions of these loops have not been directly tested, and the circuit mechanisms
driving this fundamental neurobiological adaptation remain undefined. In the proposed studies, we will use
several innovative approaches to investigate how different loop systems within the mesocorticostriatal network
communicate in vivo to organize conditioned behavior, and transition from ventral to dorsal striatal control,
across learning. One influential anatomical framework, the mesostriatal “spiral” hypothesis, suggests that
during learning, information flows serially across a subcortical loop, from the VTA to nucleus accumbens to
SNC, to dorsolateral striatum. Despite broad acceptance in the field, support for the striatal spiral has not been
demonstrated in vivo. Instead, emerging evidence suggests an alternative hypothesis: that cue-reward learning
engages progressive recruitment of the dorsal striatum via nigro-thalamo-cortical circuits, rather than the
classic striatal spiral mechanism. In Aim 1 we will combine fiber photometry recordings of somatic DA neuron
activity in TH-cre rats with simultaneous recordings of a DA biosensor in the striatum, to characterize the
spatial and temporal pattern of information flow through four nodes in the striatal DA system during cue-reward
(i.e., Pavlovian) learning, testing predictions from the spiral framework. In Aim 2, we will use trans-synaptic
targeting, optogenetics, and photometry to test the ascending spiral framework in vivo, determining if NAC
direct pathway neurons disinhibit SNC DA neurons. We will use D1-cre rats to investigate the function of direct
pathway output neurons in the NAC and DLS at different stages of learning. Finally, In Aim 3 we will combine
photometry recordings of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal circuits with optogenetic manipulation of DA
neurons in TH-cre rats, to assess the ability of nucleus accumbens DA signaling to engage the nigro-thalamo-
cortical loop. We will then optogenetically manipulate input-defined nigral neurons projecting to the thalamus to
determine the functional role of the nigro-thalamo-cortical loop in learning. These studies will resolve
longstanding questions about the circuit mechanisms of information flow across striatal input-output circuits,
establishing a normative framework for the in vivo functional architecture of the mesocorticostriatal network."
10857329,"Enhancing robotic head and neck surgical skills using stimulated simulation
Abstract
We propose stimulated simulation as the next paradigm for accelerating simulator-based training of
transoral robotic surgery (TORS) using noninvasive brain stimulation. TORS is a minimally invasive
technology that is seeing rapid adoption in the field of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery to resect
benign and malignant tumors of the pharynx and larynx as well as treat obstructive sleep apnea. As a relatively
novel and complex procedure, surgeons are learning to perform TORS after their residency, mostly during a
fellowship year. However, TORS has a steep learning curve, with a minimum of 20-35 cases needed to
achieve basic proficiency. Without a structured curriculum or effective simulation platform, most novice
surgeons currently reach the 20-35 case benchmark while operating on live patients. Consequently, positive
margin (i.e., the tumor is not entirely removed) rates for oropharyngeal cancers in low-volume centers are
twice that in high-volume facilities. Commercially available task trainers and virtual reality simulators for robotic
surgery have four major deficiencies: (i) they do not prepare trainees to operate in the confined space of the
oropharynx and do not provide the procedure-specific skills necessary for TORS, such as tissue manipulation,
retraction, or dissection using electrocautery; (ii) they are platform-dependent – training basic robotic skills for
the da Vinci platform (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA), though two platforms are currently FDA approved for
TORS, and a third one is waiting for approval, (iii) they are costly, limiting their use to the most affluent centers
and (iv) they offer no mechanism to accelerate skill acquisition beyond brute-force repeated practice.
 To address these limitations, we will design, develop, and validate the first Virtual Transoral Robotic
Surgical (VTORS) simulator for training TORS procedures and use transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS), a safe and effective, well-established, commercially available, wearable noninvasive brain
stimulation technique that uses very low direct current (<4mA) applied to the scalp to modulate cortical
excitability, to accelerate the surgical skill acquisition. We have assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of
researchers to accomplish the two aims of the project: (SA1) Design, develop and validate a high-resolution,
ultra-low-cost, versatile, and platform-independent Virtual Transoral Robotic Surgical (VTORS) simulator for
TORS tongue base resection; and (SA2) Demonstrate the training efficiency with transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) (i.e., stimulated simulation) compared with sham stimulation.
 Based on the latest developments in off-the-shelf virtual reality (VR) and tDCS technology and open-
source simulation software, stimulated simulation has the potential to become the preferred training
paradigm – simultaneously improving skills and accelerating skill acquisition - for complex psychomotor skills,
including surgery, aviation, driving, sports, and music."

 Voice therapy remains the primary treatment option for phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction, one of the
most frequently occurring conditions to affect the voice. Voice therapy aims to modify hyperfunctional vocal
behavior through vocal techniques or exercises, often with a focus on vibratory sensations in certain parts of
the airway. It is generally believed that these techniques and exercises induce adjustments in the larynx and
vocal tract that increase vocal efficiency and lower vocal fold contact pressure, an important contributing factor
to vocal fold injury. However, such understanding is largely based on theoretical and numerical simulations,
and there have been few experimental data supporting these hypotheses. Additionally, although voice therapy
likely leads to multiple simultaneous laryngeal and vocal tract adjustments, information about the specific
adjustments and their impact on vocal fold contact pressure is often vague. Currently, voice therapy outcomes
are often evaluated based on patient-reported and other secondary measures. To date, no objective measures
have been identified that would allow clinicians to reliably monitor and predict the progress of voice therapy
with greater accuracy than is currently available. The goals of the proposed research are to (1) experimentally
validate findings and hypotheses from previous numerical simulations on favorable laryngeal and vocal tract
configurations that consistently reduce vocal fold contact pressures in excised human larynx experiments; and
(2) investigate the effectiveness of voice therapy methods in reducing vocal fold contact pressures and in
eliciting the hypothesized laryngeal and vocal tract configurations to do so, and the ability of these maneuvers
to predict voice therapy outcomes."

Allergic asthma is among the most common chronic lung diseases worldwide, and despite advances in
treatment asthma prevalence continues to rise globally. Allergic asthma is largely driven by IgE
antibodies that target environmental allergens. The production of allergen-specific IgE requires T
follicular helper 13 cells (Tfh13) which must first be polarized by dendritic cells (DCs). However, a
critical knowledge gap remains: how do DCs gain the ability to induce Tfh13s? By studying DC
responses to allergic stimuli, we have determined that allergens induce a unique metabolic program in
DCs, characterized by increased glutamine metabolism. We identified that allergen stimulated DCs
exhibit aberrant TCA cycle metabolism, which leads to accumulation of α-ketoglutarate and succinate
and reduced levels of fumarate and malate. We hypothesize that DC glutamine metabolism after
allergen exposure is critical for polarization of Tfh13s. The goals of this proposal are (1) to
ascertain effector mechanisms downstream of glutamine metabolism that induce Tfh13 polarization, (2)
to elucidate key mechanistic changes in DCs induced by aberrant TCA cycle metabolites, and (3) to
determine the translatability of this pathway into human DCs. This work promises an exciting new
avenue for development of novel therapeutic targets and preventive strategies for the management of
allergic asthma."
10910988,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My career goal is to develop an independent research program focused on DNA damage signaling and how it
can be exploited for the treatment of cancer. The work that I propose here explores DNA damage signaling
mechanisms in BRCA1 mutant cancers and the implications for PARP inhibitor response. Pathogenic BRCA1
mutations increase the risk of cancer development and impair the homologous recombination (HR) DNA damage
response pathway. This HR defect confers vulnerability to DNA damaging agents, including PARP inhibitors.
PARP inhibitor efficacy is limited by the development of resistance, often caused by the restoration of HR. In
BRCA1 mutant cancers, PARP inhibitor resistance and HR activity can be promoted by expression of mutant
BRCA1 proteins. Several types of truncated hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins have been detected, though the
mechanism of localization to DNA damage and HR activity has not been established. Recently, we determined
that wild-type BRCA1 recruitment to DNA damage can proceed through RNF168-dependent and -independent
pathways involving the BRCA1 RING and BRCT domains. In preliminary data, we found that RNF168 depletion
impairs tumor growth for some, but not all, BRCA1 mutant cancers. Additionally, we show that some cancer cells
are entirely reliant on the RNF168 pathway for HR, whereas others rely on the reciprocal pathway. These findings
are in line with transgenic mouse studies where different Brca1 mutant alleles produced contrasting phenotypes
upon RNF168 knockout. Here, we explore the possibility that BRCA1 mutation-specific differences arise from
the capacity to recruit various hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins to DNA damage. We will use cell line, patient-
derived xenograft, and transgenic mouse model systems to address the fundamental question of how the
RNF168 pathway contributes to tumor progression, DNA repair, and PARP inhibitor response in different BRCA1
mutant backgrounds. Specifically, we hypothesize that depletion of RNF168 in cancers expressing BRCA1 RING
domain-containing hypomorphic proteins will impair tumor progression, eliminate HR activity, and restore
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we developed PARP inhibitor sensitive and resistant cell
line and patient-derived xenograft models that express hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins. Additionally, we generated
isogenic expression systems as well as transgenic mice with Rnf168 and various Brca1 mutations. Using these
models, we will examine the effects of genetic depletion of RNF168 on tumorigenesis and growth, localization of
BRCA1 hypomorphs and other DNA repair proteins, and response to PARP inhibition. These studies will provide
mechanistic insight into the repair processes occurring in cancers and assess the potential efficacy of RNF168
pathway-targeted therapeutics. Moreover, funding of this proposal will help me to secure an independent
investigator position and lay the foundation for future R01 applications to build a sustainable research program
focused on DNA repair and cancer biology."

We will conduct a Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial of the Project nGage
(“nGage”) intervention, an evidence-based, flexible, and tailored intervention that harnesses social support to
promote retention in care and viral suppression (VS) among HIV-positive young Black MSM (YBMSM) aged 18-
35. The study will take place in Chicago, IL, and Alabama (AL), two high-burden areas prioritized in the national
Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan. Existing efforts to improve Continuum of Care outcomes for YBMSM often rely
on newly created network members, e.g., peer navigators, support groups, case managers. Often missing from
these approaches is a focused attempt to harness organic social network supports, i.e., those people who
already offer critical forms of emotional, informational, and instrumental support. In contrast, the nGage
intervention was developed to identify, activate, and harness organic social network support for YBMSM living
with HIV. The intervention uses (1) social network visualization and theory to help men identify a Support
Confidant (SC) to engage in care; (2) the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model targeted at the SC to
activate and maintain dyadic social support; (3) a linked social support model to target the drivers of retention in
care and VS. Content is delivered via a single face-to-face session and quarterly mini-boosters. nGage's
flexibility ensures that SCs are selected based on their supportive function rather than their role. In a pilot RCT
in Chicago, we demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy. To now test effectiveness, N=600 YBMSM
living with HIV in Chicago and AL will be randomized to receive nGage (n=300) or treatment as usual (TAU)
(n=300). We also will enroll 300 SCs. At 12-months post-intervention, we will re-randomize nGage dyads to
continue receiving quarterly mini-boosters (Sustained nGage: n=150) or return to TAU (n=150). Data collection
at baseline, 12, and 24 months will include surveys and electronic medical record (EMR) data. To study
implementation, we will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as the
determinants framework and RE-AIM as the evaluation framework. The specific aims are to: (Aim 1) Evaluate
the (a) effectiveness of nGage vs. TAU over 12 months in N=600 YBMSM aged 18-35 and (b) value of continuing
nGage over another 12 months (Sustained nGage). The primary outcomes are retention in care and VS, as
measured by EMR data; (Aim 2) Examine if intervention effects (a) vary between Chicago and AL, (b) are
mediated by changes in the Index's motivational readiness, stigma expectancies, and self-efficacy, and (c) are
moderated by Index's mental health and substance use; and (Aim 3) Evaluate the implementation of nGage
using the CFIR and the RE-AIM framework. Guided by the CFIR, we will conduct surveys and focus groups with
key stakeholders to assess the inner and outer settings, implementer and intervention characteristics, and multi-
level process factors that influence implementation. We will use RE-AIM to assess Reach, Adoption,
Implementation, and Maintenance, including implementation costs in each clinical setting and geographic context"
10781988,"Project Summary / Abstract: Auditory Mechanics and Cochlear Amplification 2020
Sound input to the cochlea causes a frequency-sorted wave-pattern of sensory tissue motion that
conveys sound information to the auditory neurons, leading to hearing. A currently untreatable aspect
of hearing impairment is the deterioration of the cochlea's ability to sharply separate sound by
frequency. The cochlea's healthy frequency tuning is largely provided by the cochlear amplifier, an
outer-hair-cell-driven, place-frequency-localized electromechanical feedback mechanism that is both
powerful and fragile. This project's aims 1-3 explore the cell/structure basis of cochlear amplification.
The studies use intracochlear sensors and a cutting-edge imaging and vibrometry technology,
spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT). Localized measurements of mechanical
and electrical responses at and within the cochlea's sensory tissue will be made both in healthy
normal and in modified cochleae. Gerbils and guinea pigs are used and critical aspects of cochlear
amplification are compared in the two species in aim 2. In aim 1, measurements are made in
cochleae before and after intracochlear injection of substances that will modify tectorial membrane
(TM) mechanics. Because it governs transduction in hair cells, the TM plays a profound role in
cochlear amplification; our studies test hypotheses that are based on cochlear models and
measurements in isolated TMs and in TM-mutant mice. Aim 3 makes use of SD-OCT's penetrating
abilities to test previously untestable fluid-mechanical properties of the organ of Corti. Aim 4 explores
the transmission of sound to the cochlea by the middle ear, and how this transmission is modified by
feedback from the middle ear muscle, tensor tympani. In preliminary work, tensor tympani modified
transmission in a subtle, frequency-dependent manner that could be involved in focusing on particular
sound sources, for example during communication. Experiments in which tensor tympani is tensed
with voltage pulses will determine how the muscle affects the transmitted sound signal."
10745720,"Dormant Toxoplasma gondii [Toxoplasma] infection is characterized by dormant bradyzoite stage parasites
that reside within thick-walled cysts that develop inside neurons in the central nervous system. Cysts provide
a structural and physiological habitat that sustains the viability of dormant bradyzoite stage parasites. While
many targets and therapeutics have been identified to effectively treat the active Toxoplasma infection that is
defined by rapidly replicating tachyzoite stage parasites, therapeutic strategies or drugs that eliminate
dormant bradyzoites and their cysts have not been identified. The identification of potential targets to perturb
or eliminate dormancy has proven challenging for many microbes, including Toxoplasma, because microbial
dormancy is characterized by a reduced metabolic state that sustains viability but not replication. Several
lines of evidence support the hypothesis that dormant bradyzoites have markedly reduced mitochondrial
functions and rely more heavily on acquiring host glucose not just for energy production but also to meet an
increased demand for glucose to build bradyzoite-stage amylopectin and cyst wall glycan biomass. Consistent
with this hypothesis, our data has shown that blocking the utilization of host glucose markedly reduced the
development as well as the persistence of dormant stage bradyzoites. Here, we propose to define the
metabolic basis that underpins the ability of glucose starvation to prevent the development and persistence
of dormant bradyzoites. Targeting mitochondrial functions such as the electron transport chain has been
shown to have a partial ability to perturb but not to eliminate dormancy. We hypothesize that targeting glucose
or glucose + lactate utilization in combination with inhibition of mitochondrial function will accelerate the
demise of dormant bradyzoites and their cysts. The work in this proposal charts a way forward to identify a
metabolic basis to eliminate Toxoplasma dormancy."
10886488,"Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in kidney transplantation remains a major cause of kidney graft loss
and a critical hurdle to improve long term allograft survival, with no approved therapy. Antibody responses are
tightly controlled through T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Understanding the role of Tfh in kidney transplant and
developing clinically translatable strategies to control AMR holds promise to improve long term outcomes. Our
group has identified that Qa-1(HLA-E in human) restricted CD8 Tregs are critical regulators of Tfh, the key
modulators of B cell differentiation in the germinal center (GC) in kidney transplantation. CD8 Tregs are confined
to <5% of CD8 T cells that express a triad of surface receptors– CD44, CD122 and Ly49. Our recently published
data (Choi et al. PNAS, Dec 2020) and preliminary data describe a novel role for CD8 Treg in regulating Tfh in
allo-immunity. These CD8 Tregs express T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize Qa-1, a non-classical class-Ib
MHC molecule with limited polymorphism. We show that alloreactive activated CD4 T cells, especially Tfh,
upregulate their Qa-1 expression, making them a target for CD8 Treg suppression. Disrupting the peptide Qa-1
(pQa-1)-TCR interaction via a point mutation in the Qa-1 gene while sparing the binding of pQa-1 to the inhibitory
NKG2A receptor on CD8 Treg leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of Tfh, B Cell maturation, increased donor
specific antibodies (DSA), increased allograft complement activation, and accelerated allograft rejection.
 Our preliminary data show that mobilization and activation of CD8 Treg by specific peptide FL9 agonists
dampen Tfh-dependent anti-graft Ab-mediated injury and prolong fully mismatched kidney allograft survival.
Since HLA-E and Qa-1 are expressed as only 1 of 2 alleles, this approach is applicable to large groups of patients
and avoids the problems of MHC class Ia diversity. The clinical feasibility of FL9 peptide therapy to AMR has
high translational potential in AMR and highlights the significance of this approach.
 Our hypothesis is that during alloimmune T cell activation in kidney transplantation, alloreactive T cells,
primarily Tfh, upregulate Qa-1- stress peptide complexes, mostly FL9 on their surface, allowing tight control by
Qa1 restricted CD8 Treg. Furthermore, LY49 expressed on CD8 Treg serve as a coinhibitory signal. Identifying
peptides critical for the control of alloreactive T cells by antigen specific CD8 Tregs and the positive and negative
signals critical for their function will lead to novel targeted therapeutic strategies in allo-immunity and will be
investigated here. To test our hypothesis, we developed multiple new tools that are unique to our group. We
generated super agonists for the stress peptides to optimize in vivo CD8 Tregs expansion. We also generated a
new transgenic mouse where CD8 T cells express TCR that specifically recognize FL9-Qa1 peptide complex.
While LY49 may have inhibitory function on CD8 Tregs, we will study its role in allo-immunity through a newly
generated knockout mouse and blocking antibodies developed in our laboratory. We will test this hypothesis in
murine kidney transpant model that leads to cellular and antibody mediated rejection similar to human rejection."

research by both junior and established investigators in non-DD related fields in the Texas Medical Center. These
goals are accomplished by supporting investigator-initiated scientific studies to generate preliminary data for new
research projects. Novel approaches for studying DD-related topics that complement the DDC’s goals are
encouraged. Awards are granted following a rigorous peer-review process that involves an evaluation for
scientific merit by a Scientific Review Committee, which includes DDC Internal Advisory Committee members,
ad hoc scientists from the Texas Medical Center, and DDC External Advisory Committee members.
We are requesting $100,000/year to continue the P/F Program. This funding is significantly enhanced by
additional annual commitments from our three partner institutions, including $25,000 from The University of
Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC), $25,000 from The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) and $115,000 from Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). All P/F awardees have priority access to our

Digestive Disease Center (DDC) via the following Specific Aims: 1) To share and disseminate knowledge gained
from the presence of the DDC and in the larger field of digestive diseases; 2) To promote and increase
interaction and collaboration among investigators and clinicians interested in digestive diseases; and 3) To
foster the scientific and career development of DDC members.
To achieve these aims, The DDC developed and implemented an Enrichment Program that has several
elements: 1) the Research Seminar Series; 2) the Annual DDC Symposium; 3) the Annual DDC Scientific
Retreat; 4) DDC Core Research Workshops; 5) DDC Research Focus Group Workshops; and 6) Career
Development Initiative. Institutional and endowed support over the last funding period sponsored
complementary research symposia and lectures within the GI Sections in the three DDC institutions targeting
the research interests of DDC members.
To catalyze member scientific development and interactions, the DDC Research Seminar Series, initiated in
1998, continues to flourish through in-person and online events. This semi-weekly series is a vehicle for
prominent local, national, and international investigators to present lectures related to topics within the DDC
Research Domains. Since 2009, the DDC annual scientific symposium offers a full-day monothematic forum
focusing on topical and cutting-edge topics, and became CME accredited in 2015. Since 2019, the DDC has
enhanced the symposium schedule by adding additional networking opportunities and breakout sessions with
prominent speakers. The Directors and/or Co-Directors of the DDC four research Cores hold several DDC Core
Research Workshops on educational and technical issues of new technologies or Core activities. The DDC has
created several DDC GI Focus Groups including: a GI/liver Covid Group designed to bridge the gap between
COVID-19 clinical and research efforts; Bioinformatics User Group, which meets bi-monthly; and the Junior
Investigators Group, in which investigators meet twice monthly to discuss diverse GI research interests in both
basic and clinical sciences. In response to the global pandemic, the Enrichment Program initiatives moved to
an online format that resulted in an increase of participation among the GI community. The annual DDC retreat
format helps disseminate research findings among members and includes a poster session, which provides
robust interactions among senior investigators, junior faculty, and trainees. Awards for the best posters are
presented during the annual retreat. The DDC Career Development Initiative sponsors several activities
including preparedness for PF awards, dissemination of grant and career development information, virtual
meetings with visiting speakers, and rehearsals for national presentations."
10792857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been extremely successful in identifying numerous
germline variants associated to risk for prostate cancer, the causal mechanism between genetic variation and
disease risk remains largely unknown at the vast majority of these loci. This prohibits the full realization of
novel drug targets and/or personalized treatments. In the quest to address this gap, post-GWAS studies are
experiencing a “big data” revolution driven by the exponentially decreasing costs of high-throughput genomic
assays. Multiple layers of data (genetic variation, transcriptome levels, epigenetic modifications, localization of
tissue-specific regulatory sites, 3D interactions, etc.) are routinely collected in increasingly large cohorts of
individuals. This raises the need for rigorous computational and experimental frameworks that integrate various
types of data to identify and validate causal genes and variants in prostate cancer. Here we propose a rigorous
framework aimed at loci where risk is mediated through alteration in gene expression levels. We deliberately
and exhaustively propose to examine all risk loci for prostate cancer to prioritize causal variants and genes and
to functionally validate them in prostate cancer tissue and cell lines."
10746141,"Project summary:
Uveal melanoma (UM) accounts for approximately 5% of all melanomas and is the most
lethal type of melanoma. 50% of UM patients develop metastasis, mostly to the liver, an
invariably lethal complication, which currently cannot be effectively treated. Despite
dramatic successes in other melanoma subtypes, immune checkpoint blockade, and
targeted therapies have been largely ineffective in metastatic UM and there is an urgent
need to identify effective therapies. UM lacks mutations in BRAF, NRAS, NF1 and KIT
common in cutaneous melanomas and is genetically defined by mutations in the Gaq
signaling pathway. We discovered that RasGRP3, a Ras-guanyl nucleotide exchange
factor (RasGEF), is dramatically overexpressed in UM compared to other melanoma
subtypes and cancers and links the constitutively activated Gaq pathway to the MAP-
kinase pathway. RasGRP3 is also directly activated by oncogenic Gaq signaling via
mechanisms that partially depend on PKC. We hypothesize that RasGRP3 is a therapeutic
target in UM and seek to understand the mechanism behind its marked upregulation to
identify alternative targets for therapy. Our preliminary data implicate protein kinase D
(PKD) downstream of PKC to be directly involved in RasGRP3 regulation. Our data also
demonstrate that PKD is involved in the adaptive resistance that undermines the efficacy
of MEK inhibitors. As a druggable kinase, PKD thus is a possible therapeutic target in UM.
In this proposal, we will evaluate both RasGRP3 and PKD as therapeutic targets using
newly developed genetically engineered and xenograft models of UM metastatic to the
liver and investigate the underlying mechanism of RasGRP3 upregulation in UM (Aim 1
and 2). In Aim 3, we will dissect the mechanism underlying the adaptive resistance to MEK
inhibition, which represents a key bottleneck limiting the therapeutic efficacy of MEK
inhibition, to identify rational therapy combinations that overcome this resistance and
improve the therapeutic efficacy of MEK inhibition in the setting of metastatic UM."
10813090,"ABSTRACT
Food insecurity affected 11% of all US households in 2020, and youth and young adults with type 1 diabetes
(T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) experience even higher rates of food insecurity, 18% and 31%, respectively.
Moreover, 56% of youth and young adults with T1D and 46% of those with T2D do not achieve optimal
glycemic control, with young people from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups experiencing much higher
rates of poor glycemic control. We propose a continuation of the NIDDK-funded SEARCH Food Security
Cohort Study (SFS 1), which collected data on >1,000 youth and young adults with diabetes and documented
the role food insecurity plays in influencing glycemic control and related outcomes. SFS 1 data indicate that
compared to those who are food secure: (a) young people with T1D and food insecurity have higher HbA1c
(+0.34%, p=0.04) and (b) those with T2D and food insecurity have higher odds of diabetic ketoacidosis (3.1,
p=0.02) in fully adjusted models. However, food insecurity varies day-to-day and ranges from intermittent to
persistent, and SFS 1 did not capture the day-to-day variation, which is needed for intervention planning. Thus,
we propose a research strategy of high scientific rigor that will integrate longitudinal quantitative and
qualitative methods, including ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM), in an intensive, mixed methods study. This proposal (SFS 2) greatly expands our work in SFS 1
toward identifying the temporal causal cascades and actionable and acceptable interventions for eliminating
food insecurity. To achieve these goals, we aim to (1) leverage the ongoing SFS 1 study to enroll a cohort of
360 youth and young adults with diabetes (260 T1D, 100 T2D), 72% with a history of food insecurity, for a
repeated-measures, longitudinal mixed methods study over 9 months; (2) evaluate differences in real-time
glycemic control between participants with varying levels of food insecurity, assessed by average daily time in
range (TIR) via CGM over two 14-day time periods spaced 9 months apart; (3) evaluate the within-participant
impact of food insecurity on TIR and intermediate paths using EMA methods, including dynamic structural
equation models; (4) use longitudinal, qualitative methods to concurrently and deeply characterize the context
of participants’ food insecurity experience and coping process, by conducting a concurrent events study of 30
individuals with T1D and 15 with T2D with a history of food insecurity through in-depth, one-on-one, repeated
semi-structured interviews over 9 months. This study will integrate intensive data collection of the primary
outcome (TIR by CGM) and the primary exposure (daily food insecurity), as well as measures of physical
activity, diet, and mood. These quantitative data will be complemented by longitudinal qualitative interviews,
which will allow us to triangulate the quantitative data with participants’ lived experiences. The findings will
contribute to future interventions and policies that are designed to interrupt the cycle of food insecurity and
poor glycemic control and are effective for and acceptable to young people with diabetes."
10746111,"Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), and the related livestock disease, nagana, are caused by infection of
the kinetoplastid parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. These maladies cause devastating health and economic impacts
in sub-Saharan Africa. Kinetoplastids, including T. brucei, T. cruzi and Leishmania spp., exhibit many novel
biological features, such as U insertion/deletion editing and universal trans-splicing of mRNAs. Thus,
understanding the basic biology of these parasites is a cornerstone on the path to discovery of unique biological
processes that could potentially serve as much-needed new drug targets. One novel kinetoplastid feature is the
almost complete lack of transcriptional control of gene expression. Instead, these parasites constitutively
generate long polycistronic transcripts that are resolved into monocistrons by 5’ trans-splicing and 3’ cleavage
and polyadenylation (PA). The resulting obligate posttranscriptional gene regulation relies on RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), and RBP regulation of transcript fate is mediated by their binding to cis-acting sequence
elements typically located in mRNA 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). Transcriptome-wide studies in T. brucei
revealed widespread alternative PA (APA) sites on many transcripts. APA is significant because use of different
PA sites can lead to inclusion/exclusion of critical 3’UTR elements that regulate transcript stability or translation
efficiency. Despite the potential for APA to profoundly affect gene expression, nothing is known regarding the
mechanisms that control APA in kinetoplastids, constituting a major gap in our knowledge. We discovered that
knockdown of the T. brucei RBP, DRBD18, leads to substantial changes in APA, marking DRBD18 as the first
factor in trypanosomes known to modulate APA, and highlighting its potential to control inclusion/exclusion of
distinct cis-regulatory 3’UTR elements. Single cell RNAseq in DRBD18-replete vs. -depleted cells analyzed using
different bioinformatic platforms revealed that distinct 3’ UTR variants, generated by DRBD18-mediated APA,
are more important drivers of cell identity than is overall transcript abundance. These findings underpin our
central hypothesis that DRBD18 regulates APA by controlling access of the cleavage/PA machinery to distinct
3’ UTR sites and, in this manner, dramatically influences cell identity. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) Identify
DRBD18-regulated 3’UTR variants associated with alterations in cell identity; (2) Define transcriptome-wide
whether DRBD18-mediated APA results in altered trans-splice sites on downstream open reading frames or
whether it leads to generation of new trans-spliced and polyadenylated intergenic fragments, thereby informing
its mechanism of action; (3) Determine the transcriptome-wide effect of DRBD18 on cleavage/PA machinery
RNA binding. The proposed studies are significant because they will fill major gaps in our knowledge regarding
fundamental aspects of mRNA processing, RBP regulation of APA, and the functional consequences of APA in
controlling cell-to-cell heterogeneity in this medically and economically important parasite."
10754583,"Project Summary: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by proteinuria and is associated with podocyte
actin cytoskeletal disorganization termed foot process effacement (FPE). Podocytes are incapable of self-
renewal, and podocyte loss above~40% per glomerulus associates with glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and kidney
failure. Distinct from FSGS, Minimal Change Disease (MCD) also shows diffuse FPE, but has preserved
podocyte numbers, and is highly treatment responsive with a low rate of progression to ESRD (5-20% in 20
years). FSGS has been associated with glomerulomegaly and podocyte hypertrophy in later stages. However,
early FSGS can be morphologically indistinguishable from MCD and a debate exists whether some MCD cases
transition to FSGS, representing a “switch” between diseases. Hence, understanding signals specific to MCD
will reveal mechanisms facilitating podocyte survival and preventing a phenotype “switch”. Interestingly, Fyn
kinase inactivation was specifically identified in human MCD. In mice, Fyn inactivation (by Shroom3 silencing)
also associated with FPE without podocytopenia - an “MCD-like” pathology. Hence Fyn inactivation was a
candidate MCD-unique signal. Downstream of Fyn-inactivation, investigation of anti-hypertrophy and pro-
survival pathways in podocytes revealed enhanced activation of AMP-kinase, explaining these effects. Fyn
inactivation activated AMPK by increasing cytoplasmic efflux of LKB1. Moreover, inhibition of Ampk in MCD-like
mice induced podocyte loss, glomerulomegaly and FSGS, while AMPK activation prevented podocyte loss after
glomerular injury induced by hypertrophy and direct toxins. Invitro data show increased autophagy as the central
pro-survival mechanism in podocytes after AMPK-activation. We hypothesize that in the context of injury causing
podocyte FPE, AMPK signaling regulates the “switch” between MCD and FSGS by enhancing autophagy and
preventing podocytopenia. In this proposal, we will test the role of podocyte AMPK signaling in MCD vs FSGS,
and establish downstream mechanisms regulating podocyte survival. In Aim I, we will use genetic and
pharmacologic model systems to specifically inactivate or activate AMPK to induce phenotype changes from
MCD-to-FSGS and vice versa. In Aim-II, we will modulate autophagy in podocytes while activating AMPK to
show the central role of AMPK-mediated autophagy in podocyte survival. We will also specifically examine the
role of autophagy in restricting glomerulomegaly during injury. Finally, in Aim-III, applying state-of-the-art and
multidimensional technologies to the largest NS cohort in the US, we will investigate the specific role of AMPK
signaling in human MCD vs FSGS. Our work will provide novel MCD-FSGS diagnostics, and develop novel
AMPK therapeutics as well as help repurpose FDA-approved AMP-activators."
10912428,"Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGAs) are potent antibiotics which have long been used as
potent broad spectrum antibiotics, with targets including gram negative and gram‐negative
pathogens, and complex infectious diseases such as hospitalized CAPD and exacerbated CF.
Significant limitations of the AGAs, however, are AGA‐induced permanent hearing loss
(ototoxicity), which is reported to affect up to 20% of the patient population, nephrotoxicity,
and resistance due to AGA and target modifying mechanisms.
 Based on extensive preliminary results two series of compounds, paromomycin and
apramycin derivatives, will be synthesized and optimized for their ability to inhibit Gram positive
and Gram negative wild type and multidrug resistant bacteria, and to do so with a much
improved toxicity profile.
 To achieve these ends all synthetic compounds will screened for their ability to inhibit
bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes, indicative of antibacterial activity and toxicity respectively,
and for their activity against engineered bacterial strains carrying specific resistance
determinants. The results of these assays will be used in a feedback loop to inform the design
and synthesis of the next iteration of compounds.
 A select set of optimized compounds will be screened for ototoxicity in the mouse
cochlear explant model and then in the guinea pig model of ototoxicity. Nephrotoxicity will be
assayed in three relevant cell lines and for advanced compounds in mice. Antibacterial efficacy
of the optimized compounds will be determined in mice. Pharmacokinetics of advanced
compounds will determined in mice.
 At the end of the study, the goal is to have a small validated set of advanced compounds
that display broad and potent antibiotic activity against wild type and multidrug resistant Gram
positive and Gram negative bacteria, with much reduced toxicity, suitable for further
development."
10834013,"Background. Cardiac events are the leading cause of death among firefighters and occur while on-duty at an
alarmingly high rate. Short, disrupted sleep is a major, modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD),
and up to 40% of firefighters experience sufficiently severe sleep disruption to screen positive for sleep
disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is well-established as efficacious and effective
within health care settings. However, the effectiveness of CBTi-informed sleep health coaching and sleep
health promotion in workplace settings, and among firefighters specifically, is largely unknown. Theory-driven
research is required to address this research-to-practice gap and also identify facilitators to and barriers of
intervention implementation in this high-risk population.
Goal. The primary objective of this proposal is to examine whether a scalable, CBTi-informed intervention,
firefighter sleep health coaching (ffSHC), improves sleep disturbances when implemented in a real-world, high-
demand work environment.
Methods. This study proposes to conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in order to
examine the effectiveness of an evidence-based sleep health coaching intervention delivered to 400 career
firefighters across 20 fire departments (Aim 1). The primary outcomes are (a) the pragmatic PROMIS Sleep
Disturbances questionnaire and (b) the multidimensional sleep health index derived from actigraphy.
Secondary and tertiary outcomes include: sleep related impairment, sleep continuity, blood pressure, heart
rate, and long-term clinic-assessments of cholesterol, body mass index, and blood pressure. To advance
implementation science, this project will employ the Integrated Promotion Action on Research Implementation
in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework to guide a mixed methods formative evaluation (Aim 2a) of
intervention adaptations and implementation strategies. A theory-based process evaluation (Aim 2b) is
embedded within the clinical trial to explore combinations of factors that promote agency-level implementation
and to inform future implementation research in public safety settings.
Significance and Innovation. This research will accelerate the translation of sleep health intervention to
workplace wellness and advance implementation science through the application of the iPARIHS framework.
The use of sleep health coaches is innovative and models how programs may expand reach to address the
global problem of insufficient sleep. The long-term goal of this research is to provide critical knowledge that
facilitates the widespread implementation, dissemination, and sustained utilization of sleep health intervention to
promote continuous, sufficient sleep and ultimately mitigate CVD risk. Achievement of study goals will improve the
health and wellness of firefighters, a population whose health is vital to assuring public safety and supporting
community resiliency."
10732772,"Ample preclinical data suggests that grape seed procyanidin extract (GSE) possesses multi-faceted anticancer
properties. GSE has been shown to favorably modulate carcinogenic mechanisms, including 1) major
eicosanoids pathways, such as inhibitions of cyclocoxygenase (COX)-2/prostaglandin (PG)E2, induction of
prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS)/PGI2 and increase production of 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE);
2) downregulation of oncomirs microRNA (miR)-19a, -19b and up-regulations of their downstream targets - tumor
suppressors insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-2R) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
resulting in reduction of phosphorylated (P)-AKT, as well as downregulation of oncomir miR-106b and
upregulation of its target – the tumor suppressor P21. Recently, we have found that oral leucoselect phytosome
(LP), a standardized GSE complexed with soy phospholipid to enhance bioavailability, significantly inhibited
human lung cancer xenograft growth, reduced bronchial Ki-67 labeling index (a marker of proliferation), favorably
modulated major eicosanoids pathways, and downregulated serum miR-19a, -19b, and -106b in heavy
current/former smokers. We therefore hypothesize that oral administration of LP is safe, can favorably modulate
mechanisms associated with lung cancerization, and be useful for lung cancer treatment. To test these
hypotheses, a single arm, phase IIa neoadjuvant lung cancer treatment study using LP, will be conducted in 30
patients with newly diagnosed, stage I and II resectable lung cancer.
Aim #1: will determine the safety, feasibility and pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) of 2-3 weeks
of oral LP in stage I or II nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients prior to resection. Subjects will consent to
study participation and archive of specimens for research, including blood, urine, and from diagnostic
procedures, such as bronchoscopy [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and cells, lesion biopsies and lymph
node (LN) sampling] and/or transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) as clinically indicated, to be used as pre-
treatment samples. Qualified subjects who are diagnosed with resectable lung cancer will be enrolled and treated
for ~2-3 weeks until surgical resection. At the time of surgery, serial clinical specimens, including BAL, LN, lung
tumor/adjacent tissue, blood and urine will be collected as post-treatment samples for assessing
PK/bioavailability, PD and mechanism of actions when applicable. The safety of oral LP will be monitored weekly
with the NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events Version 5.0 and adverse reaction questionnaires.
Aim #2: To determine the antineoplastic and mechanistic effects of oral LP in stage I/ II lung cancer patients.
The anticancer effects of LP will be assessed by comparing its bioactivity pre- vs. post-treatment, as measured
by modulations of tumor pathological response, downstaging, Ki-67 labeling index, activated caspase 3
(apoptosis marker), COX-2, PTGIS, 15-LOX, PTEN, P-AKT, IGF2R; 2) markers of inflammation and antitumor
immunity: PGE2, PGI2, 15-HETE, interleukin (IL)-6, -10, -12, C reactive protein (CRP) In BAL, plasma, and/or
tumors; 3) cancer-relevant, pathway specific gene expression profile in BAL cells and tumors; 4) epigenetic
miRNA profile in BAL cells and tumors; 5) miR-19a, -19b, and -106b in serum and tumors.
Aim #3: will validate the roles of miR-19a, miR-19b, and miR-106b in mediating the anti-neoplastic effects of
GSE and the utility of serum miR-19a, -19b, and -106b as surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBM) for therapeutic
monitoring. In our previous studies, we found that GSE significantly down-regulated well-known lung cancer
oncomirs miR-19a, -19b, and -106b in human lung neoplastic cells and A549 xenograft tumors in nude mice, as
well as in the serum of heavy current/former smokers.
Findings will provide important insights into the feasibility and mechanistic effects of GSE/LP against lung cancer,
help identify SEBM and set the stage for future confirmatory clinical trials."
10781932,"Project Abstract
The success of any bacterial pathogen ultimately depends on its ability to multiply and transmit to new hosts.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis and one of the most
successful pathogens in human history, likely also employs sophisticated means to spread from one person to
the next, including mediating caseation, tissue destruction, and airborne transmission. Yet, despite the toll Mtb
has taken on world health, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Mtb transmission remain elusive. A
major symptom of active tuberculosis is cough, and cough is a major mechanism of transmission. Although
cough is a major route of aerosolization and transmission of Mtb, very little is known about the factors that
produce cough during infection. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Mtb strains
representing specific lineages are more prevalent in humans but whether differences in prevalence are due to
differences in bacterial transmissibility and associated factors such as cough induction and aerosolization of
bacteria is unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need to better characterize the transmission dynamics of Mtb
and the relationship of cough to transmission. Because nociceptive neurons mediate cough, and some bacteria
including mycobacteria secrete complex molecules targeting neurons, we hypothesized that Mtb produces
molecules to trigger nociceptive neurons to activate the cough response, thereby facilitating transmission. We
discovered and characterized the activity of one such molecule, sulfolipid-1, and recently identified a second
molecule produced by virulent mycobacteria. In the proposed research we will (1) Identify and study the
sulfolid-1 receptor in neurons and experimental animals, (2) Characterize the activity of the second nociceptive
molecule in neurons and experimental animals, and determine how its activity combines with that of sulfolipid-1
(3) Develop and use a sophisticated Mtb transmission system to measure transmission, cough and aerosolized
particles safely and quantitatively and use the system to compare the transmissibility of a variety of Mtb
mutants lacking cough-inducing molecules. The proposed work is expected to identify novel factors associated
with nociceptive neuron activation, cough and mycobacterial transmission."
10757648,"Skin disease is constantly changing over time; rashes flare, moles grow, ulcers heal, and chronic skin disease
severity fluctuates over time. Patients only see dermatologists at infrequent and irregular intervals that do not
match the clinical course of the disease. As clinicians and researchers do not have an easy way of monitoring
skin disease in between formal clinical visits, valuable granular information about skin disease progression,
flares, and improvement in response to treatment, is currently being lost.
 The number of people in the United States older than 65 years is growing. By 2030, 20% of all
Americans will be older than 65 years, making the geriatric population the same size as the pediatric
population. The incidence of dermatologic conditions is rising in parallel, with more than 27 million visits to
dermatologists each year. Yet transport difficulties, limited mobility and increased fall risks make frequent clinic
visits challenging for frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of
teledermatology; however, our qualitative interviews with dermatologists, older adults and caregivers highlight
substantial barriers with current mobile health tools, with no readily accessible way to monitor skin disease at
home. There is an urgent need for a user-friendly tool for older patients to collect photographs, symptoms and
monitor their skin disease from home.
 We propose to expand our novel, older adult-friendly, teledermatology virtual assistant – Dermatology
for OldeR Adults (DORA) – to support clinical disease monitoring. DORA facilitates skin disease monitoring
from home, instead of in-person clinic visits. Our preliminary data show that DORA is easier for older adults to
use compared to current teledermatology platforms because it enables image collection using simple
conversational text message reminders, without requiring high technology literacy.
 In this study we will: 1) Develop a longitudinal image library of common skin conditions affecting older
adults including all skin types using DORA. We will oversample participants with skin of color to address
healthcare disparities arising from under-representation of skin of color in dermatology images. 2) Describe the
progression and natural history of common skin diseases affecting older adults by observing patterns and
patient experiences of older patients who use DORA. We will compare the information collected virtually
through DORA to in person clinical assessments at 6 and 12 months. 3) Conduct semi-structured interviews
with physicians from diverse healthcare settings to identify barriers and solutions to implementation and clinical
utility of home-based digital monitoring of skin disease. Successful completion of these aims will result in a
novel, readily accessible way to monitor skin disease in older adults from home, reducing burdensome or
unnecessary clinic visits while maintaining quality of life. This approach can be used in other settings where
technology literacy barriers and unequal access to dermatologists contribute to healthcare disparities."
10748417,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the 250,000 annual patients in the United States with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), the majority are at
low risk for morbidity and mortality. In fact, evidence-based guidelines suggest that up to 50% of patients with
an acute PE are at sufficiently low risk for complications that they can be safely managed without hospital
admission. Yet fewer than 5% of patients nation-wide are currently discharged for outpatient management.
Reliable access to anticoagulant medications and outpatient follow-up are commonly cited barriers to
outpatient management. However, prevailing heuristics used by Emergency Medicine clinicians to enable rapid
decision-making also firmly link acute PE with hospital admission, and likely makes behavior change for these
busy clinicians more challenging. Multiple prior efforts to reduce hospital admission for low-risk patients with
acute PE have been limited by single-center designs, inclusion of homogenous and highly-resourced health
systems, or have lacked a robust implementation plan underpinning to their design and evaluation. Using the
diverse, state-wide Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative (MEDIC), we will refine,
tailor, and evaluate a multi-component intervention suitable for broad dissemination to increase the use of
outpatient management of low-risk acute PE for patients presenting to the emergency department. Following
an implementation mapping approach built upon published literature and our preliminary findings, our
intervention will address key barriers identified by a diverse group of stakeholders by combining traditional
implementation science and behavioral economics strategies. Importantly, electronic alerts will be informed by
user-centered design approaches to fit within the clinician workflow and decision-making process and “right
sized” to appear only for applicable patients. Evaluation will include both quantitative and qualitative elements
from the RE-AIM implementation evaluation framework. This multi-component intervention will facilitate a
patient-centered approach to clinical decision-making that improves value by reducing unnecessary
hospitalization for patients with low-risk PE. Furthermore, by tailoring and evaluating this intervention within a
diverse set of hospitals, our multi-component intervention will be well positioned for dissemination nation-wide.
Finally, our use of multi-site implementation mapping will provide a blueprint for other multi-site collaboratives
interested in improving outcomes for a broad array of clinical conditions through rigorous quality improvement
and implementation initiatives."
10754952,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One-third of U.S. adolescents and young adults (AYAs) report e-cigarette (EC) use, making it the leading
nicotine/tobacco product used by AYAs. Most longitudinal studies of e-cigarette use only focus on short-term
outcomes 1-3 years later, do not fully examine newer vs. older generation e-cigarette products, and do not
consider potential differences by sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, or sexual orientation.
Potential bias in e-cigarette estimates over time is not well understood. These gaps warrant longer-term
prospective investigations with clinically relevant measures in diverse national samples of AYAs. This project
will identify longitudinal trajectories of e-cigarette use and their relationships with cigarette smoking, other
nicotine/tobacco products, other substance use, tobacco use disorder (TUD) symptoms, nicotine/tobacco
cessation, and health consequences related to nicotine/tobacco use among U.S. AYAs. Our study aims to: (1)
Compare state-of-the-art statistical approaches for reducing nonresponse bias in estimates of trajectories and
survival models for EC use due to differential attrition, and evaluate the reporting bias associated with self-
reports of EC use using biomarker data; (2) Examine the initiation of e-cigarette use and transitions with other
nicotine/tobacco product use and other substance use in AYAs over 4- and 7-year time periods of longitudinal
data; (3) Identify the trajectories of EC, cigarette, and other tobacco use and their longitudinal relationships
with adverse health consequences (e.g., TUD symptoms, health problems) measured with survey and
biomarker data in AYAs over 4- and 7-year time periods, and determine if trajectories or consequences differ
by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, sexual orientation, or newer vs. older e-cigarette products; and (4)
Based on the Social Ecological Model, assess multiple levels of risk and protective factors (and interactions
across levels) for EC use trajectories and their associations with other nicotine/tobacco use, tobacco cessation,
and health consequences over 4- and 7-year time periods, and examine if EC use trajectories and their
associations with other nicotine/tobacco use, tobacco cessation, and health consequences differ by age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, sexual orientation, or newer vs. older EC products. An experienced team will conduct
secondary analyses of longitudinal data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) and Population Assessment of
Tobacco and Health (PATH) studies. These two epidemiological studies are the most recent and largest
nationally representative longitudinal studies that allow for the identification of long-term trajectories and
consequences of EC use among AYAs. This project will use longitudinal data from a nationally representative
sample of 9,800 secondary students measured between 2014 and 2020 in the MTF study, and a prospective
nationally representative sample of 13,651 adolescents (12-17 years), 9,802 young adults (18-25 years), and
22,506 adults (26 and older) measured across six waves in the PATH study (2013/2014-2020)."
10752674,"Although blood-contacting medical devices (BCMDs) have become lifesaving alternatives to organ
transplantation for many patients, thrombotic and bleeding events remain the most common postoperative
complications that tend to be devastating and often life-threatening. Device-induced hemostatic dysfunction is
commonly believed to be the culprit of these complications and is directly related to platelet activation and
receptor shedding associated dysfunction caused by the non-physiological shear stress (NPSS) in these
devices. Over the years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-aided simulation and analysis have been widely
adopted to achieve significant research efforts on device-induced platelet dysfunction. With the help of the CFD
technique, regions of abnormal NPSS and stagnant flow in blood flow paths can be precisely identified to assess
further the potential risk of thrombosis and bleeding in devices. However, the existing CFD models for predicting
shear-induced platelet activation and receptor shedding and related hemostatic complications (thrombotic and
bleeding), mainly based on the empirical models, have limited success from the device design perspective.
This proposal aims to develop a novel platelet activation model based on the art-of-state interpretation of the
platelet’s fundamental morphological change upon activation. It will be incorporated in the development of CFD
models capable of assessing in-vitro and in-vivo device-induced platelet dysfunction and associated adhesion
capacities to substrates. Numerical algorithms and implementation schemes will be developed to link shear-
induced platelet damage models to CFD variables to predict device-induced platelet dysfunction. Quantitative
adhesion capacities of device-damaged platelets to collagen, vWF, and fibrinogen could be used to represent
device-associated potentials for thrombosis and bleeding. Experiments will then be performed to validate the
CFD-based predictive modeling. Finally, a sheep study will be performed to test the CFD models for in-vivo
predictive modeling. CFD models will incorporate sheep-specific blood properties, device geometry, device
operating conditions, platelet consumption, and generation models to predict the in-vivo device-induced platelet
dysfunction and altered adhesion capacities of sheep on VADs and ECMO support. The successful completion
of this project will result in CFD-based predictive tools. These tools can be used to provide quantitative evaluation
of the performance and in-vivo biocompatibilities of BCMDs and aid the development and optimization of new
BCMDs with improved functional characteristics and biocompatibility."

Mammalian cells expend large amounts of energy into generating enzyme-mediated RNA chemical
modifications that can change the base-pairing, RNA structure, or recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, among
other elusive roles. Pseudouridine (ψ)-modified mRNAs are more thermodynamically stable, more resistant to
RNAse-mediated degradation, and have the potential to modulate immunogenicity and enhance translation in
vivo. However, ψ detection is extremely challenging: ψ modifications do not affect Watson-Crick base pairing
and are indistinguishable from uridine when using hybridization-based methods. Further, since ψ is an isomer
of uridine, detection using mass spectrometry requires non-quantitative chemical derivatization methods. While
recent studies have shown that RNA modifications can be detected through direct RNA nanopore sequencing
by monitoring basecalling errors, we have recently shown that the accuracy and fidelity of this approach is
relatively low and sequence dependent. Our team has recently used a ligation approach to produce synthetic
mRNA controls that contain single ψ sites within relevant transcripts mammalian cells. Using these synthetic
controls we performed nanopore-based RNA sequencing and developed computational tools that increase the
accuracy of ψ-calling to 90+%, depending on the specific sequence. We are basing our work on our recent
finding that achieving ψ quantification requires sequence-specific training using unique signal parameters. The
initial success of our team has laid the foundation to 1) generate an expanded set of barcoded synthetic RNA
constructs that contain single ψ sites, 2) obtain a rigorous set of quadruplicate nanopore runs with ~50,000
single-molecule reads per construct, 3) develop computational tools to allow highly accurate sequence-specific
ψ-calling. We will develop a gold-standard set of synthetic mRNA transcripts as a training molecular set for
quantitative ψ profiling in direct RNA nanopore sequencing of human transcriptomes. The molecular set will
allow quantitative profiling of hundreds of putative ψ sites across mammalian samples.
This proposal will serve an unmet need by addressing a critical bottleneck: the lack of available modified RNA
modification gold standards, i.e., RNA molecules that contain a site-specific and structure-specific modification.
In this collaborative project we will develop a complete pipeline for synthesis of gold standard molecules; use
these molecules to measure the nanopore signals that ψ modifications produce; develop a machine-learning
tool to accurately quantify these modifications; profile site-specific ψ modifications in various cell lines to obtain
ψ-maps that can be used to assess relationships of ψ modifications with phenotypes."

While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in men and women, substantial sex differences
exist in disease prevalence and prognosis. A key impact of menopause is risk of future CVD. Post-menopausal
women are twice as likely to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure
hospitalization rates disproportionately increase in women as they age. We hypothesize that a key contributor to
this trend are hormonal changes during menopausal transition which accelerate myocardial stiffening. The impact
of menopausal transition on myocardial stiffness is unknown. If understood, new disease prevention and
therapy monitory strategies with significant potential for long-term benefits could be investigated.
Elevated myocardial stiffness, a precursor of several CVDs, can go undetected prior to heart failure symptoms from
diastolic dysfunction because left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is preserved, and absolute LV chamber stiffness
is not routinely measured. Current quantitative stiffness measurements require ex vivo mechanical testing or
invasive pressure-volume measurements, hampering their adoption as practical clinical biomarkers.
This proposal’s objective are to 1) establish a baseline for normal stiffness values during natural aging through
menopausal transition and 2) identify sex as a biological variable. To accomplish these goals, we will develop a free
breathing 3D non-invasive cardiac magnetic resonance elastography (cMRE) technique to measure myocardial
stiffness. The technological advances in this study will make myocardial stiffness imaging in heart failure patients
with dyspnea more reliably, regional, and enable quantitative cross-sectional and longitudinal monitoring of
myocardial stiffness. Our preliminary data shows that LV myocardial stiffness increases significantly in healthy
women, but not men, after the age of 50, which corresponds to the average age of menopausal transition. If cMRE
can be used to detect elevated myocardial stiffening during menopausal transition and prior to the development of
diastolic disfunction, the monitoring of current and new preventive interventions prior to heart failure symptoms will
be made possible. To accomplish these objectives, we will:
• Develop a 3D, free-breathing cMRE application.
• Retrospectively bin cMRE data for multiple 3D MRE volumes that vary during the cardiac cycle.
• Validate cMRE in static and pulsatile realistic cardiac phantoms.
• Identify a clinical and technically feasible acquisition durations in a normal volunteer pilot study.
• Evaluate the influence of natural aging, sex, and menopausal transition on myocardial stiffness.
The natural evolution of myocardial stiffness in natural aging, in relation to sex-biases, and throughout menopausal
transition will be evaluated using a newly developed and implemented free breathing non-invasive quantitative
cMRE approach, which may have significant implications for the prevention of heart failure."

This research will provide information on the inner working of the kidney as it recovers from acute injury.
Recovery of the kidney from acute injury is often incomplete and leaves behind a kidney that is prone to
subsequent permanent decline due to physical and metabolic stresses of trying to compensate for incomplete
healing. Ideally, targeted intervention would hasten recovery from acute kidney injury and diminish its long-
term consequences. However, major knowledge gaps in the area of renal recovery currently preclude a rational
approach to treatment. Knowledge gaps include the physical reason why the injured kidney appears to filter less
fluid, the vulnerability of the injured kidney to be further injured by changes in blood pressure, or whether
standard medical treatments or prescribed diets are helpful or harmful in patients recovering from kidney injury.
Kidney features that are observed at the whole-kidney level emerge from events at the microscopic level and
treatments have their direct effect at the microscopic level. However, there can be multiple combinations of
microscopic events that could account for a given observation at the whole-kidney level. Therefore, microscopic
behavior cannot be deduced from whole-kidney behavior and must be observed directly. This cannot be done in
humans but can be done in rat models of human kidney injury using specialized techniques uniquely available
to the investigators. Through these methods, this research will determine the effects of simple maneuvers on
multiple internal variables thereby establishing boundary conditions for efficient design of future clinical trials
in the field of kidney recovery."

Stroke is a debilitating disease, affecting >15 million people worldwide annually, the majority of which are over
65 years old. Developing effective treatments for older stroke patients remains a pressing need. Stroke causes
disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to brain damage, hemorrhagic transformation (HT), and worse
functional outcomes. We have discovered that mitochondrial energy production in cerebrovascular endothelial
cells (CECs) plays a central role in maintenance of BBB integrity both in in vivo and in vitro models. We have
found altered levels of several microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma and primary CECs (pCECs) from aged stroke
mice. Specifically, expression of miR-34a is upregulated in both the plasma and pCECs from aged stroke mice
compared with sham controls. Notably, miR-34a is also upregulated in plasma from stroke patients compared
to healthy controls. Overexpression of miR-34a in murine CECs (mCECs) increases BBB permeability,
compromises mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔΨm) while decreasing the levels of several mitochondrial related genes; Leucine zipper-EF-hand containing
transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) in human CECs (hCECs) and LETM domain containing 1 (LETMD1) in
mCECs. Importantly, our preliminary data show that LETM1 is significantly reduced in CECs in autopsy samples
from stroke patients compared with controls. Additionally, we have shown that global knockout of miR-34a (miR-
34a–/–) reduces infarct size and conversely, overexpression of miR-34a (miR-34aTG) increases infarct size in mice.
Similarly, systemic delivery of antagomiR-34a (a miR-34a inhibitor) reduces infarct size and improves long-term
functional recovery in stroke mice. Although our findings provide compelling evidence that miR-34a plays an
important role in stroke pathophysiology, the mechanism by which endothelial miR-34a mediates brain damage
is unknown, especially in aged models of stroke. The objective of this proposal is to investigate if endothelial
specific miR-34a affects stroke outcomes in the aged brain. We hypothesize that endothelial miR-34a regulates
BBB permeability, ischemic damage, hemorrhagic transformation, and stroke-induced deficits by inhibiting
translation of LETM1 and LETMD1 leading to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics in CECs. Aim 1 will test if
endothelial specific knockout of miR-34a improves acute and long-term stroke outcomes in aged mice of both
sexes. Aim 2 will identify a mechanism by which miR-34a inhibits translation of LETM1 and LETMD1 leading to
impaired mitochondrial function in CECs following stroke. Aim 3 will determine the therapeutic potential of
nanoparticle delivery of endothelial cell targeted miR-34a antagomir in aged stroke mice of both sexes. Our
studies will elucidate the role of endothelial miR-34a in stroke. Understanding the preclinical effects of endothelial
specific antagomiR-34a treatment is an important step in the development of novel therapies for elderly stroke
patients."

Despite advances in the medical care of sickle cell disease (SCD), most patients continue to experience
debilitating pain, poor quality of life, progressive organ deterioration, and premature death. We are developing a
novel, potentially curative therapy for SCD based on genome editing of autologous hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) to induce the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, 22) in red blood cells (RBCs). Natural genetic
variants can generate high levels of HbF that alleviate or eliminate the pathophysiology of SCD. Our published
studies show that one of these variants can be recreated by Cas9-mediated disruption of a -globin gene
promoter motif recognized by BCL11A, a transcriptional repressor protein that drives the normal perinatal switch
from -globin to -globin expression. New preliminary data show that transfection of normal or SCD patient donor
CD34+ cells with ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of Cas9 and guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the
BCL11A binding motif, followed by xenotransplantation into immunodeficient mice, consistently achieved ≥70%
on-target editing in bone marrow-repopulating HSCs, with no off-target mutations detected by rigorous genome-
wide activity analysis at a sensitivity of 0.1%. The modified HSCs generated RBCs in vivo with >30% pancellular
HbF and 18-31% sickling in 2% O2, compared to <5% HbF and 62-71% sickling in unmodified control RBCs
(P<0.0001). We will now translate our findings “from bench to bedside” by designing and carrying out a first-in-
human clinical study, termed St. Jude Autologous Genome Edited Stem Cells (SAGES1), examining the safety
and efficacy of autologous -globin promoter-edited CD34+ cells (drug product SJ-1001) according to 3 Aims.
Aim 1 will define the mechanism of action, potency, and safety profile of SJ-1001 through FDA-enabling and
exploratory research studies. Aim 2 will establish cGMP clinical scale manufacturing of SJ-1001 by optimizing
process development, generating drug product release assays for the clinical trial, and transferring these
protocols to the St. Jude current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) facility. Aim 3 will establish and manage
the SAGES1 clinical trial to evaluate one-time SJ-1001 infusion as a cure for SCD. This will include the
development of an enhanced multidisciplinary informed consent process, safety and efficacy assessments, and
post therapy mechanistic studies. Our work has the potential to relieve suffering and extend the lifespan of
thousands of patients with severe SCD."

Non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a highly prevalent and costly health condition characterized for many by
recurrent, fluctuating or persistent pain and limitations in function over time. The overall objective of this project
is to curtail the costly long-term course of LBP. The goal of the current project is to understand the role of specific
spinal movement impairments to the course of recovery of people presenting with acute LBP, and to examine
the immediate and short-term effects of treating the impairments in people with acute LBP. Spinal movement
impairments in people with acute LBP are of particular interest because the impairments have been found to be
highly relevant to the clinical course in people with chronic LBP. Our central hypothesis is that the spinal
movement impairments will 1) be prevalent in patients with acute LBP, 2) persist to varying degrees over time,
3) be related to the course of recovery of acute LBP and function, and 4) be a viable target for treatment in the
acute stage. We will conduct a prospective, observational cohort study of 212 people (ages 18-60) who have
acute LBP but do not have a history of chronic LBP. We will collect 1) measures of spinal movement impairments,
2) self-report surveys of patient characteristics, LBP history, psychosocial behavior, comorbidities, treatment
use, imaging, LBP intensity and functional limitations, and 3) findings from our clinical exam. The measures of
movement, self-report surveys and exam data will be collected at baseline of the acute episode, and at 2 and 6
months thereafter. We will collect a subset of the self-report surveys electronically weekly from baseline-to-8
weeks and monthly from 3-12 months. At baseline and 2 and 6 months after the acute episode we will 1) examine
the prevalence of the impairments, 2) test if the degree of the impairments at baseline, as well as change over
time in the degree is related to LBP and functional limitations, and 3) test if the degree of impairments at baseline
and change in impairments over the 6 months after the acute episode will predict transition to chronic LBP. To
test the effect of treating the impairments in the acute stage, we will conduct an early phase learning trial (Phase
2A) in a 2nd sample of people (n=68) who present to an Emergency Department (ED). We will randomize people
to 1) motor skill training in functional activities (MST) + usual care (UC) or 2) UC. MST will be provided in the ED
and twice in the following 2 weeks. In the ED and 2 weeks after the ED visit we will collect self-report surveys
and movement data. Then for each of 10 weeks, we will collect a subset of the self-report surveys electronically.
We will test the immediate (within-session) and short-term (2 and 12 week) effect of MST+UC to UC. Expected
outcomes will be specific information about the 1) change in prevalence of the impairments over the course of
recovery, 2) relevance of change in the impairments to change in the person’s pain and function over time,
including the transition to chronicity, and 3) effects of treating the impairments. Successful completion of this
project will have an immediate, high impact on research and evaluation and treatment of people with acute LBP
that could improve the costly course of LBP for people who have incomplete recovery from an acute episode."

Meniscal tearing is a significant risk factor for the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). The long-
term goal of this project is to develop an innovative biologic therapy to improve meniscus tear healing for the
prevention of PTOA. Our laboratory has demonstrated the efficacy of utilizing cartilage-derived progenitor cells
(CPCs) to stimulate healing of meniscal tears in a small animal model. In efforts to translate our success in small
animals to a clinically relevant large animal model, we will optimize and implement a bioactive tear interfacing
fibrin hydrogel (FibroGel) that is laden with CPCs and infused with the chemokine Stromal Cell Derived Factor-
1 (SDF-1) and the small molecule Kartogenin (KGN), which collectively increases CPC retention at the tear site
and increases their chondrogenic matrix synthesis, respectively. The objectives of the proposed study are:
To optimize FibroGel as a novel biologic therapy for meniscus tear repair; (2) To determine its efficacy for
stimulating tear reunification and reduction of PTOA severity; and (3) To collect biocompatibility data throughout
the study to aid in clinical translation of this technology. There are three independent specific aims: (I) Optimize
cellular and bioactive components of FibroGel to produce robust fibrocartilage matrix re-synthesis to bridge and
reunify meniscus tears; (II) Evaluate the efficacy of using FibroGel for improving meniscal fibrocartilage healing
in a preclinical large animal model; and (III) Determine the efficacy of FibroGel-augmented meniscus repair in
attenuating PTOA in the knee. The research design will employ a meniscus tissue explant model to optimize
FibroGel in order to maximize cell retention and chondrogenic matrix re-synthesis at the tear site, as well as
increase the strength of tissue reintegration/reunion at the tear site. A porcine model of meniscal injury will be
used to examine the short- and long-term efficacy and biocompatibility of FibroGel. Outcome assessments will
include evaluation of meniscus tear healing, evaluation of PTOA severity as determined by biomarker analysis,
gait asymmetry analysis, and macroscopic/microscopic assessment of the articular cartilage and synovium
following FibroGel treatment. Successful completion will have a positive impact by facilitating the development
and translation of a new strategy to stimulate meniscus injury repair through the use of cellular biologics. This
project is relevant to the mission of NIAMS because it seeks to find innovative ways to treat musculoskeletal
injuries and prevent arthritis."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and other immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but the
non-responsiveness of most cancers to ICB-based monotherapy remains a significant problem. A major reason
for the non-responsiveness of these so-called ‘cold’ tumors is that they lack an immunogenic tumor
microenvironment (TME) and thus escape T-cell killing despite expressing ICB targets. How to selectively
intensify the immunogenicity of the TME has been an unmet challenge. Here we propose a new small-molecule
approach that activates necroptosis and triggers robust innate immune responses in the TME. This new avenue
derives from our work on influenza A virus (IAV). Our early findings showed that IAV activates necroptosis in
infected cells. Necroptosis kills infected cells and is highly immunogenic. It is initiated when viral RNAs activating
the host protein ZBP1. Recently, and highly relevant for cancer immunotherapy, we found that ZBP1 activates
necroptosis from the nucleus. Such ‘nuclear necroptosis’ is significantly more immunogenic than conventional
(cytoplasm-initiated) necroptosis because it ruptures the nucleus and releases hyper-inflammatory nuclear
DAMPs into the extracellular space. We also found that the viral RNAs that activate ZBP1 are Z-RNAs. Although
these unique ZBP1 activators should be superb adjuvants for ICB, Z-RNA is unstable and hard to produce absent
virus infection. Z-DNA, however, is structurally almost identical to Z-RNA, binds ZBP1 with the same affinity, and
can be stably produced in eukaryotic cells by distorting DNA into the Z-conformation. This suggested that a
compound that can generate Z-DNA in cells would activate ZBP1 and trigger on-demand nuclear necroptosis
without need for virus infection. Such a compound would fill the long-unmet need for a necroptosis agonist for
use in cancer immunotherapy. We have now identified a small molecule, curaxin, which induces Z-DNA
formation in live cells and directly activates ZBP1 to trigger ‘on-demand’ nuclear necroptosis in cells of the TME.
These and other findings allow us to propose the hypotheses that curaxin alters chromatin structure and induces
the formation of Z-DNA; that such Z-DNA recruits ZBP1 to the nucleus and triggers nuclear necroptosis; and that
curaxin-induced nuclear necroptosis will greatly improve ICB treatment outcomes. In this proposal, we will ask
how curaxin triggers Z-DNA formation (Aim 1), how Z-DNA activates ZBP1 and nuclear necroptosis (Aim 2), and
whether induction of nuclear necroptosis by curaxin has combinatorial benefit with ICB in clinically-relevant
mouse models of melanoma (Aim 3). The successful completion of these Aims will outline an entirely new small-
molecule based strategy to activate a highly inflammatory form of necroptosis and potentiate ICB-based
immunotherapies, with important clinical ramifications."

 Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a disorder with recurrent, debilitating seizures as well as comorbidities
that greatly decrease quality of life. Many patients respond poorly to medications, making research important to
develop new treatments. A focus of research has been a part of the hippocampus called the dentate gyrus
(DG), and a glutamatergic cell type in the DG called the mossy cell (MC). MCs have a direct excitatory
projection to the main neuronal cell type, granule cells (GCs), so MCs are theoretically in an important position
to regulate the role of the DG in TLE. Although MCs can excite GCs, many investigators consider MC-GC
excitation is weak. Instead, MCs are thought to primarily activate DG GABAergic neurons that inhibit GCs. In
this proposal we hypothesize that both the excitatory and inhibitory actions of MCs on GCs have important
roles, particularly when an initial insult leads to TLE. Our central hypothesis is that during the initial insult,
MC excitation of GCs plays a critical role because it strengthens greatly, leading to strong excitation of
GC targets and excitotoxicity. In contrast, in chronic epilepsy, we hypothesize a very different MC role.
We suggest that MCs resume their normal role to activate DG GABAergic neurons and inhibit GCs,
which reduces chronic seizures. Therefore, during the initial insult, MCs should be inhibited for the
best outcomes and during chronic epilepsy the MCs should be activated. If supported, this hypothesis
would be a paradigm shift by changing the view of MCs in TLE. In addition, the proposed experiments will fill
major gaps in knowledge because little is known about MCs during the initial insult, latent period, and chronic
epilepsy.
 Notably, MCs regulate behavior and cognitive tasks in normal mice. We recently showed MCs regulate
tasks related to anxiety and cognition, which are comorbidities in TLE. Therefore, we hypothesize a role of
MCs in the behavioral comorbidities in TLE.
 Together these experiments will challenge prevailing views and fill several knowledge gaps about MCs, the
DG, and TLE. Furthermore, the experiments will potentially give rise to new approaches for therapeutics."

Amyloid plaque deposition, a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), begins 1-2 decades
before manifestation of clinical symptoms of dementia. Among cognitively intact individuals and in AD’s most
prevalent sporadic form, the production of amyloid-β (Aβ) does not change, while clearance of Aβ is slowed,
indicating that the failure of Aβ clearance may underlie the development of AD pathology and that interventions
that improve its clearance may provide an opportunity for primary prevention of AD. Over the past 10 years,
our group has helped to define the ‘glymphatic system’, a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways along
which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) surrounding the brain exchanges with brain interstitial fluid, supporting the
clearance of interstitial wastes, including Aβ and tau. Impairment of glymphatic clearance is observed in the
aging brain and in mouse models of AD. Thus, improving glymphatic clearance of brain interstitial proteins may
be one approach to preventing the development of AD. Glymphatic function is regulated by sleep-wake
behavior, with faster clearance occurring during sleep. Tai Chi is a Chinese martial art focusing on mindful
body movement, posture, and breathing as an avenue to achieve a state of internal balance, calm, and clarity.
In clinical studies, practice of Tai Chi is associated with improved sleep quality, cognition, mood,
cardiovascular and respiratory function, and balance/physical activity. However, the physiological processes
underlying the cognitive and affective effects of Tai Chi remain undefined. We hypothesize that Tai Chi practice
improves glymphatic function. To test this hypothesis, we will enroll 75 middle-aged (50-70 years) participants
with different levels of Tai Chi practice experience: Tai Chi proficients (10+ year of practice, n=25), Tai Chi
beginners (12 months practice, n=25) and Tai Chi naïve participants (n=25). We will 1) examine the
association between Tai Chi practice and glymphatic function using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) using contrast-enhanced MRI, T1/FLAIR assessment of MRI-visible perivascular spaces, intravoxel
incoherent motion, and fast BOLD-fMRI; 2) examine relationships between Tai Chi practice and sleep,
including sleep fragmentation, efficiency, and duration, assessed by self-reported questionnaires and objective
measurements of sleep duration, fragmentation and efficiency using a bed pressure mat. We will examine the
relationship between sleep measures and MRI-assessed glymphatic function. The ultimate goal of this study is
to elucidate mechanisms of Tai Chi practice in prevention of AD and related dementias. This pilot study will
determine whether long-term Tai Chi practice is associated with physiological changes in glymphatic function
and sleep. If we find cross-sectional association among Tai Chi practice, glymphatic function, and sleep, in the
future we will investigate whether these changes are associated with duration of Tai Chi practice and whether
these changes are associated with changes in AD biomarkers in a longitudinal study or in a prospective
randomized clinical trial."

Suicidal ideation and behavior are growing public health problems in the United States. This is particularly
concerning during the high-risk period following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization when risk for suicide
is among the highest rates observed. Unfortunately, our current ability to predict suicide is only slightly above
chance. This poor predictive ability may be due to an overreliance on distal/cross-sectional suicide risk factors
alone, rather than an emphasis on proximal risk factors (the dynamic cognitive, affective, and behavioral
experiences occurring in the days, hours, and minutes prior to suicide). The proposed study builds upon our
team's existing infrastructure and expertise in digital phenotyping and ecologically valid models of suicide risk.
We will examine how affective (e.g., negative affect) and contextual (e.g., social interactions, cognitions, & sleep
disruption) proximal risk factors interact to influence suicidal ideation and confer risk for suicidal behavior,
particularly during the high-risk period following hospitalization. We will recruit and follow-up with 240 psychiatric
inpatients hospitalized for suicidal ideation or behavior over a five-year study period. Participants will complete
baseline assessments including clinical interviews, laboratory-based behavioral assessments, and self-reports
of distal risk factors associated with suicide. During hospitalization, participants will begin completing ecological
momentary assessments (EMAs) of affect, cognition, behavior, and social/environmental context. Following
discharge, participants will continue EMA monitoring for 4-weeks at baseline and again for two 3-week EMA
“bursts” at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments. During each EMA monitoring period, we will collect digital
phenotyping data (e.g., sleep, location, activity level/movement) using wearables and smartphone sensors. We
will conduct 3- and 6-month follow-up assessments in our lab to re-administer lab-based behavioral assessments
and collect outcome data including suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and re-hospitalization. The proposed
study aims to identify proximal risk factors for suicide and use intensive longitudinal methods to characterize the
relationships among affective and contextual proximal risk factors while also examining how distal risk factors
moderate the relationships among proximal risk factors and between proximal risk factors and suicidal ideation
and behavior. We will examine these relationships both before and after discharge from psychiatric
hospitalization. The results of this study have the potential to substantially enhance our understanding of suicide
phenomenology as it exists in the real world, particularly across the high-risk period following psychiatric
hospitalization, with the potential to improve our ability to predict, prevent, and ultimately treat suicidal thoughts
and behaviors using traditional and technology-enhanced interventions."

 Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal variant of prostate cancer (PCa) that may arise de
novo or in 17-30% of patients previously treated with standard of care androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for
prostate adenocarcinoma (AC) as a mechanism of resistance. Serum biomarkers with high sensitivity and
specificity for non-invasive detection for NEPC are urgently needed to enable clinicians to select the proper
next-line systemic therapy in a timely manner, select of patients for clinical trials, and monitor treatment
responses that entail reversing the NEPC state. A novel strategy that allows quick identification of ‘‘human-
unique’’ proteins in a mouse serum background, thereby overcoming limitations associated with proteomics-
based biomarker discovery, has been used successfully to identify serum glycoprotein biomarkers in ovarian
cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We hypothesize that PCa PDX tumors that reflect human PCa
express unique tumor-associated glycoproteins that can be readily identified in sera of tumor-bearing mice
using mass spectrometry. Moreover, different serum glycoproteins and their levels are associated with different
subtypes of PCa PDXs, namely, pure AC, AC mixed with NEPC, and pure NEPC. Finally, these subtype
specific biomarkers can be used to identify NEPC in clinical samples from PCa patients.
 In Aim 1, we will identify novel serum glycoproteins associated with subtypes of PCa PDX tumors by
glycoproteomic analyses of PDX sera. Specifically, PDX tumors will be generated using cryopreserved tissues
from publically available PDXs lines with pure AC, AC mixed with NEPC and pure NEPC histology by subrenal
implantation into immunodeficient mice. Quantitative proteomics will be performed to generate glycoproteomic
profiles of PDX sera and human-specific proteins will be selected bioinformatically. In Aim 2, serum proteins
found in samples with a NEPC component but not expressed in pure AC samples will be selected. The top 5
candidate NEPC-specific biomarkers for which a targeted assay is developed successfully will be validated in
sera from PDX mice and patients with pathologically confirmed NEPC component. The sensitivity and
specificity of these biomarkers will be assessed using sera from patients with pathologically confirmed AC and
benign prostatic hyperplasia as true negative control.
 Our approach would lead to biomarkers that could be developed quickly for use in the clinic to reduce
morbid biopsies and appropriately triage patients to therapies tailored to their disease state, which in turn, will
improve quality of life and survival. In addition, these biomarkers could be used to monitor patient response to
standard-of-care therapies and select patients for clinical trials testing novel therapies developed in the future
that target NEPC specifically. Moreover, the subtype-specific glycoproteins we identified could serve as the
basis for future imaging strategies or targeted therapies. Finally, the glycoproteomes of NEPC will provide a
valuable resource for better understanding the mechanisms of NEPC development."

Insufficient and poor sleep is pervasive among individuals with shoulder conditions requiring surgical
intervention.
Impaired preoperative sleep has been shown to induce hyperalgesia, predict the onset of painful
episodes, and result in worse postoperative pain outcomes. Given the contributing role unmanaged acute pain
has on developing chronic pain, patients with s
hortened sleep and increased sleep disturbances (e.g., inefficient
sleep) may be at greater risk for developing chronic post-surgical pain. Research shows the utility of pain
trajectories to predict the development of chronic post-surgical pain, yet there is a dearth of research examining
how changes in sleep contribute to the development of chronic post-surgical pain, despite evidence showing
sleep impacts pain. One pathway through which poor sleep may contribute to chronic pain is through increased
systemic inflammation. Shortened sleep and increased sleep disturbances induce an outsized inflammatory
reaction, including upregulating cytokines, which sensitizes the nociceptive response and may increase
susceptibility for developing chronic post-surgical pain. As many as 1 in 5 patients undergoing shoulder
arthroplasty require prolonged opioid therapy for pain management. To date, postoperative opioid utilization has
been assessed predominantly using patient self-report or dispensing records, with little known regarding real-
time postoperative opioid use trajectories. This prospective study seeks to elucidate sleep presentations, as well
as underlying inflammatory changes, that catalyze the acute to chronic pain transition after shoulder arthroplasty.
This will be accomplished by leveraging actigraphy sleep-related data and medication utilization data collected
daily using electronic monitoring from participants pre- and postoperatively and pairing those data with
biopsychosocial outcomes and inflammatory markers up to 3-months later. This study aims to characterize and
classify sleep trajectories prior to and after shoulder arthroplasty via actigraphy devices. Additionally, this study
will examine the development of chronic post-surgical pain and real time opioid utilization, captured using
Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS) caps, across sleep trajectories. Finally, this study will compare
longitudinal changes in inflammatory markers and subsequent development of chronic pain. These research
aims reflect the PI’s career development objectives to develop expertise in the areas of cytokine research,
implement actigraphy devices and MEMS into prospective studies for real-time objective data collection, analyze
and visualize longitudinal data, and to develop vital leadership skills. This research, conducted under the
guidance of an interdisciplinary team of mentors, will aid the PI in cultivating skills needed to advance as an

10773079,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prescribing of, and adherence to, glucose-lowering medications is increasingly being driven by health
insurance factors such as high out-of-pocket medication costs and formulary practices that restrict use (e.g.
requirements for prior authorization). These types of cost-related medication restrictions (defined as high
copayments, high deductibles, formulary restrictions) can limit appropriate use of evidence-based medications,
especially when formularies lag behind a rapidly evolving evidence base. For example, recent evidence
suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
events and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated CV risk. If cost-related medication
restrictions limit the use of evidence-based, guideline recommended therapies in these patients, it may
ultimately result in worse health outcomes. Such policies can also increase administrative burden for the
practitioner and contribute to provider burnout. The goal of this proposal is to develop a provider-facing
intervention to address cost-related restrictions and improve medication use for patients with type 2 diabetes. It
has 3 specific aims: 1) To examine the association between cost-related medication restrictions and initiation
of, and adherence to, newer 2nd line glucose-lowering medications among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D)
with and without established CVD, 2) To describe the cost-related restrictions experienced by health care
providers seeking to prescribe glucose-lowering medications, and how they respond to such restrictions in
contemporary practice and 3) To develop and pilot test a provider-facing, educational outreach intervention to
help address cost-related restrictions and improve the optimal use of glucose lowering medications. These
aims will be complemented by a career development plan that incorporates didactic coursework, participation
in workshops, and intensive mentorship under an outstanding team led by Dr. Walid Gellad, an R01-funded
investigator with a track record of successfully mentoring K awardees. The plan fills important gaps in the PI’s
training and will generate pilot data to form the basis of a follow-up R01 application testing whether a provider-
facing educational outreach intervention can improve the evidence-based use of glucose lowering medications
and clinical outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes."

Carbohydrate enzyme gene clusters in human gut microbiome
Hippocrates said ~2,400 years ago: “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food”. It is now well known
that this is largely due to the “diet-microbiota-host” interactions that happen in the human gut. In particular,
microbial degradation of carbohydrates can produce a variety of metabolites, which have a profound impact on
human health. As a bioinformatics researcher in the Nebraska Food for Health Center, the long-term interests of
the PI include: (i) develop specialized computational tools for better functional annotation of food-digesting
microbial genomes and metagenomes, and (ii) characterize enzymes and other genetic elements that connect
microbes, diets, and human health. The objective of this R01 project is to develop a suite of bioinformatics tools
for functional annotation of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) and CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs) in human
gut microbiome. The PI has over 10 years of experience in CAZyme bioinformatics tool development, and
maintains a well-recognized CAZyme annotation database and web server called dbCAN
(http://bcb.unl.edu/dbCAN2). This project aims to further dbCAN development to address fundamental
personalized nutrition questions: (i) is a gut microbe able to utilize a specific type of glycan? (ii) can a person
carrying certain gut microbes respond to an individualized diet (e.g., prebiotics: dietary compounds that are
beneficial to human health)? To address these questions, new CAZyme annotation tools must have the ability
to predict the carbohydrate substrates of CAZymes.
Recent research has found that different CAZyme encoding genes are often co-localized with each other and
with other genes (e.g., those encoding sugar transporters, regulators, and signaling proteins) in bacterial
genomes to form CGCs (also known as polysaccharide utilization loci or PULs). Thus, the foundation of the new
tool development is that the gene membership (or functional domain composition) of a CGC can be used to
predict its carbohydrate substrates (e.g., xylans, pectins, glucans, etc.). The innovation is that machine learning
approaches will be used to analyze a large number of experimentally characterized PULs curated from literature,
and the extracted sequence features will be used to build effective classifiers to predict and classify CGCs in
new genomes/metagenomes. The expected outcome will be novel and user-friendly open source computer
programs, databases, and web servers that allow automated CGCs identification and substrate predictions. The
significance is that the new tools will facilitate the experimental characterization of more PULs and their
carbohydrate substrates in human gut microbiome (also in other carbohydrate rich environments). Therefore,
this project will contribute computational solutions to the research of personalized nutrition, e.g., analyze a
person's gut microbiome to predict if this person can respond to diets containing certain prebiotic glycans."
10861720,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) has an extremely high mortality rate, indicating a clear need for new therapeutic
approaches. One such approach is immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Unfortunately, despite the
presence of anti-tumor effector cells in many OvCa patients, ICI therapies have poor response rates in OvCa.
One reason for this may large numbers of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) present in the OvCa. Both MDSC and TAM negatively regulate immunity
in cancer and therapeutic approaches which can disrupt the recruitment/function of these cells can enhance ICI
response. A potential therapeutic target to disrupt MDSC/TAM is Egfl6. Egfl6 is a developmental growth factor
which is known to regulate cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation and is highly expressed in OvCa.
We found that mice which overexpress Egfl6 have increased numbers of granulocytes and monocytes in both
the bone marrow (BM) and spleen. Egfl6 treatment of BM myeloid cells was associated with an integrin
dependent increase in p-Syk, and differentiation to IL-10+ and S100A9+ granulocytic MDSC. Murine tumors
which overexpress Egfl6, compared to controls, (i) have a significant increase in MDSC accumulation and M2-
like TAM, (iii) express CXCL2 and CLEC5a, factors associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)
formation, and (iii) are refractory to ICI therapy. We thus hypothesize that Egfl6, via Syk activation, promotes an
immunosuppressive TME by increasing numbers of MDSC/TAM and their production of NETs in tumors. As an
extension of this, we hypothesize that inhibition of Egfl6, will enhance the efficacy of ICI therapy. To test our
hypotheses, we propose: SA1. To evaluate the requirement for Syk in Egfl6 signaling on myeloid cells. As Syk
is required for integrin signaling in granulocytes, we hypothesize that targeted disruption of Syk will prevent Egfl6-
dependent granulocyte accumulation. Using specific Syk inhibitor compounds and Syk-KO
granulocytes/monocytes, we will dissect the Egfl6-Syk regulatory axis. SA2. To analyze the role of Egfl6 in NETs
formation and resistance to ICI therapy. We found Egfl6 expressing tumors have increased levels and NETosis
and that Egfl6 induces CXCL2 and CLEC5a, factors associated with NETosis. This occurs both in the presence
and absence of ICI therapy. We hypothesize that Egfl6, by induction of NETs, limits the anti-tumor immunity
promoting resistance to ICI therapy. We will use CXCL2 and CLEC5a mediated inhibition/KO approaches to
define the mechanisms by which Egfl6 induces NETosis and the impact of Egfl6 induced NETosis on ICI cytotoxic
immunity. SA 3. Evaluate the impact of Egfl6 neutralizing antibody on the efficacy of ICI therapy and anti-tumor
immunity. We will use an immune competent ICI responsive murine OvCa model to evaluate the ability of an
Egfl6 neutralizing antibody to overcome Egfl6 mediated immune suppression. Combined these studies will
characterize a novel mechanism of OvCa mediated tumor immune suppression and validate EGFL6 antibody as
a novel therapeutic approach to enhance ICI therapy in OvCa patients."
10754937,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Despite improved intraoperative management some thoracic surgery patients suffer respiratory distress of
unknown origin after lung resection. Based on human observational studies that eosinophilia in the
perioperative period correlates with deleterious outcomes, we decided to study perioperative inflammation in a
small animal model of lung surgery. We noted that pulmonary resection results in a transient but pronounced
elevation of eosinophils in the blood and pulmonary tissue. Furthermore, we determined that global eosinophil
depletion prior to lung resection substantially improves perioperative survival, oxygenation, and ameliorates
post-operative pulmonary edema. The systemic increase in eosinophils results from their accelerated
maturation from progenitors in the bone marrow. This process of maturation is, counterintuitively, accelerated
by endogenous corticosteroids and is associated with the upregulation of specific cytokines in the bone marrow
and lung tissue. Disruption of select cytokines, such as the alarmin IL-33, or genetic deletion of defined cell
populations, such as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), abrogates perioperative eosinophilia and improves animal
survival after major pulmonary resection. These findings led to our central hypothesis that perioperative stress
mediates endogenous steroid and cytokine-dependent eosinophil maturation and mobilization that is
deleterious to recovery partially due to production of nitric oxide. To explore this hypothesis, we propose three
Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we propose to define the mechanism/s of “stress-induced” endogenous corticosteroids
that increase maturation of eosinophils after pulmonary resection. We will specifically focus on the cytokine
environment as well as direct steroid sensitivity by eosinophils and their progenitors. In Aim 2 we will use cell-
specific conditional gene knockout strains of mice to determine the mechanism/s of eosinophil recruitment and
toxicity after pulmonary resection. We hypothesize IL-33 activates group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) which
then promote eosinophil homing and/or maturation. We will also define the role of eosinophil produced nitric
oxide in pulmonary pathology. In Aim 3 we will explore if excessive fluid administration and large ventilatory
tidal volumes increase eosinophil maturation and/or toxicity. We also plan to evaluate if disruption of eosinophil
development, by using clinically relevant protocols of IL-5 neutralization to effectively reduce their numbers,
can ameliorate deleterious effects in the perioperative period. Our data will provide novel insight into cellular
immune responses contributing to post-lung resection respiratory failure. Our data may allow for exploration of
novel therapeutic strategies or repurposing of FDA-approved drugs not currently known to improve
perioperative patient responses."
10881955,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Structural racism, defined as the ways in which societies foster discrimination through mutually
reinforcing inequitable systems, has emerged as an important social risk factor and contributor to poor health
outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities (Egede 2020, Bailey 2017). Structural racism captures upstream historic
racist events (such as slavery, black code laws, Jim Crow laws, and school segregation) and more recent state
sanctioned racist laws in the form of redlining. Redlining refers to the practice of systematically denying various
services to residents of specific neighborhoods/communities, often based on race/ethnicity (Bailey 2020).
 A first important link between historic redlining and health outcomes is likely related to health care
access in the form of accessible hospital and neighborhood clinics, as well as the quality of these facilities. A
second important linkage between historic redlining and health outcomes is likely associated with the way in
which structural racism (in the form of redlining) has systematically deprived neighborhoods of economic
opportunities, and as such, of the ability to build individual and community assets in the form of housing value,
employment, and educational opportunities for its residents. These linkages between structural racism, access,
community assets, and health disparities, are furthermore of significant current policy relevance as recent
trends indicate a growing number of hospital and clinic closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Ellison 2021).
 However, the link between historic redlining and urban hospital and clinic closures as well as
community assets and community health outcomes are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to inform
our understanding of the pathways between structural racism (defined as historic redlining), urban hospital and
clinic closures, community assets, and health outcomes; and to further inform policies that can help reduce the
impact of structural racism on health disparities caused by hospital and clinic closures. The present study
seeks to accomplish this objective by using recently developed causal and interpretable machine learning
methods, along with econometric counterfactual analysis, to address the following aims: 1) Examine the
relationship between regional exposure to structural racism and the propensity of hospital and clinic closures.
2) Examine the relationship between hospital and clinic closures and community employment, income, and
education, as well as community health outcomes. 3) Predict risk of closure among urban hospitals and clinics
that are disproportionately serving racial/ethnic minorities from neighborhoods with exposure to structural
racism. 4) Undertake stakeholder engagement to address prevention of future closures and/or examine ways
to decrease the potential adverse community impact of hospital and clinic closures. The study is innovative in
its examination of the linkages between structural racism and health outcomes; its emphasis on identifying
policy channels for reducing the perpetual impact of structural racism; and its methodological use of a broad
set of mixed methods to achieve these aims."
10800706,"Project Summary/Abstract: Oral immunotherapy with PALFORZIA® is a recently FDA-approved therapy to
treat peanut allergy. This therapy requires daily doses of characterized peanut proteins administered orally to
peanut hypersensitive individuals. A major limitation of the PALFORZIA® therapy is the potential for the onset
of allergic responses and possibly anaphylaxis due to activation of peanut-specific IgE coated mast cells.
Development of hypoallergenic peanut proteins devoid of IgE-mediated granulocyte activation potential may
address the known safety limitations of therapy with PALFORZIA®. The rise of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and
rapid production and dissemination of mRNA COVID vaccines has highlighted the benefits of mRNA vaccines
to protect against infectious diseases. The goal of this project is to utilize mRNA vaccine technology to express
peanut proteins that lack and/or disrupt known IgE epitopes to provide a peanut allergen vaccine that does not
induce allergic reactions in hosts hypersensitive to the native allergen. This proposal will utilize the dominant
peanut allergen, Ara h 2, which is recognized by majority of peanut allergic individuals and is sufficient to induce
hypersensitivity in mice, to develop mRNA vaccines that produce native Ara h 2 or mutant Ara h 2 with mutations
in known linear IgE epitopes. The studies described in this proposal will evaluate in vitro protein production, in
vitro IgE-mediated granulocyte activation, in vivo immunogenicity, and in vivo allergic disease activation in hosts
sensitized to the native allergen. The results from this proposal will generate proof-of-concept preliminary data
to support future studies to develop mRNA vaccines expressing multiple peanut proteins to treat peanut-
hypersensitivity in allergic hosts."
10786019,"An experimentally-refined, dynamic gene regulatory network model of T-cell memory
Summary
T cell memory induced by prior exposure to a pathogen or vaccination provides enhanced protection against a
subsequent infection with the same pathogen. Enhanced protection is partially driven by clonal expansion, which
leads to an increased number of T cells capable of recognizing the antigen. Additionally, memory T cells possess
a “rapid recall ability” that allows them to fight pathogens by producing cytokines and other effector molecules
within minutes of re-exposure (as opposed to days, upon initial exposure). We recently showed that rapid recall
correlates with the epigenetic poising of enhancers and promoters of the “rapid-recall genes” in memory T cells.
Importantly, the sites of epigenetic change significantly overlap with the risk loci for autoimmune and atopic
disease, suggesting that this mechanism is important for human health. However, it is still unclear if and how
the epigenetic poising causes enhanced expression of rapid recall genes. Furthermore, memory T cells persist for
a lifetime; yet the mechanisms that maintain the memory epigenome – for decades– are not known. Our
preliminary data suggest that rapid recall is coordinated by several families of transcription factors (TFs) and
thousands of putative DNA regulatory elements. This complexity requires a systems-level, engineering approach.
Thus, this proposal is a collaboration between the groups of Artem Barski, a T cell biologist, and Emily Miraldi,
a mathematical modeler, to create experimentally validated, genome-scale models of memory immune responses
across heterogeneous T cell populations.
 Aim 1. Using single-cell genomics, we will characterize the gene expression and chromatin dynamics of T cell
activation in naïve and memory cells and build mathematical models that integrate these data (along with
relevant existing genomics resources) into a dynamic gene regulatory network (GRN). Our GRN model will
predict the molecular drivers (TFs) and regulatory elements that orchestrate rapid recall.
 Aim 2. Although T-cell activation in naïve and memory cells similarly promotes nuclear translocation of
inducible TFs, our data lead us to hypothesize that chromatin remodeling upon initial pathogen exposure alters
the occupancy of inducible TFs in memory T cells and that this is the basis of rapid recall. We will combine
dynamic TF perturbation and occupancy experiments to establish the molecular interactions driving rapid recall.
 Aim 3. We will identify the mechanisms by which memory T cells maintain the epigenome conducive for
rapid recall – over the human lifespan. We hypothesize that constitutive TFs maintain the epigenome poised for
rapid recall. We propose dynamic TF perturbation experiments to uncover the identities of these regulators.
 This study will help uncover basic mechanisms of T cell memory and identify potential targets for
manipulating immunologic memory responses. Because rapid recall is the basis for vaccination and central to
allergy, asthma, and cancer immunity, this study will have a broad impact on human health."
10893309,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has revolutionized molecular imaging and
substantially improved diagnosis and monitoring response to treatment of many deadly diseases such as cancer.
However, FDG-PET technology has a number of limitations including long examination time, long pre-scan
fasting time, and the use ionizing radiation. Hyperpolarization of nuclear spins increases their alignment with the
field of an MRI scanner by 4-6 orders of magnitude, resulting in corresponding gains in the MRI signal. As a
result, it becomes possible to detect low-concentration metabolites in vivo. Furthermore, spectroscopic MRI
enables detection of real-time metabolism of an injected exogenous hyperpolarized contrast agent because it
can map the injected metabolic probe and its products. The entire hyperpolarized MRI scan is performed in
approximately 1 minute. The leading hyperpolarized contrast agent is [1-13C]pyruvate, which probes the
biochemical pathways of aberrant energy metabolism at the cellular level. This next-generation technology has
the potential to revolutionize molecular imaging in the future. It is now being evaluated in nearly 30 clinical trials.
The hyperpolarized state of [1-13C]pyruvate is currently produced at clinical-scale via dissolution Dynamic
Nuclear Polarization (d-DNP) technology, which employs cryogenic temperature, high magnetic field, and high-
power microwave irradiation. This technology is very slow: it takes approximately 1 hour to produce a clinical
dose. Minor concerns are the high cost of over $2M and requirement for expensive cryogens for operation.
Faster and more affordable approaches are needed to make hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate accessible for
widespread clinical use. In 2015, we have co-invented an alternative technology for low-cost production of
metabolic probes called Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Enables Alignment Transfer to
Heteronuclei (SABRE-SHEATH). In 2019-2022, we and others have demonstrated that hyperpolarized [1-
13C]pyruvate can be produced using this new technique, which relies on the simultaneous exchange of
parahydrogen gas (the source of nuclear spin hyperpolarization) and [1-13C]pyruvate on metal complexes.
Unlike d-DNP, SABRE-SHEATH is highly scalable, rapid (1 min) potentially allowing to produce over 10 doses
per hour. Moreover, our collaboration has demonstrated the feasibility of removing the SABRE catalyst from
hyperpolarized solutions to prepare catalyst-free solutions of hyperpolarized compounds. This proposal focuses
on addressing the key remaining aspects of SABRE-SHEATH to prepare bio-compatible formulations of
hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate contrast agent. Specifically, the investigators will develop and optimize the
instrumentation (based on an already commercialized prototype) that will integrate (1) clinical-scale (~1 g dose)
production; (2) SABRE-catalyst extraction; and (3) reconstitution in a biocompatible buffer, followed by feasibility
studies in cells. We anticipate that our end product of this two-year award, i.e., the developed instrumentation
(a.k.a. hyperpolarizer) will enter clinical trials and will be commercialized."
10835884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is growing evidence that limited access to high-quality cancer treatment is one of the main drivers of
higher cancer mortality rates among rural cancer patients. Our analyses of Iowa Cancer Registry data indicate
that 40% of rural patients with breast and colorectal cancers receive most or all definitive treatment in rural
hospitals that do not collect or monitor data on their quality of cancer care, and are not accredited by the
American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC). Our data also shows these patients are less
likely to receive guideline-concordant care. Given patients' needs and preferences to receive cancer care
locally, a promising strategy to improve quality of cancer care and outcomes in rural populations is to intervene
directly with the community hospitals in these areas. New evidence has demonstrated effectiveness of this
approach: the Markey Cancer Center Affiliate Network (MCCAN) was formed by the University of Kentucky
(UK) Markey Cancer Center to improve quality of cancer care in their own rural, low-resourced state, one that
leads the nation in cancer incidence and mortality. Over the last decade MCCAN has facilitated the sharing
and diffusion of resources and best practices throughout their network. As a result, affiliates markedly
improved performance on established, cancer care quality measures and expanded their services (e.g.,
psychosocial and survivorship support). They were also almost 3 times more likely to obtain CoC accreditation
than their matched controls. However, the MCCAN model has not been rigorously defined, evaluated or tested
in any other setting. We propose to adapt this successful health system-level intervention for Iowa, establishing
the Iowa Cancer Affiliate Network (I-CAN). Although there are similarities between Iowa and Kentucky's
populations that suggest the MCCAN model may be a good fit, there are also significant differences in
healthcare infrastructure and resources that require careful adaptation of the intervention prior to its
implementation in order to retain its effectiveness. We will use novel, rigorously developed, theory-based
implementation science methods to identify MCCAN's core functions (i.e., what makes it effective), study the
implementation process and evaluate how I-CAN performs in a new context. We have identified 4 rural, Iowa
hospitals to participate in this intervention trial and developed expert support teams to assist key stakeholder
groups within each hospital. Through interviews and qualitative analyses, we will assess determinants and
outcomes of the implementation process, and perceived value of the CoC accreditation standards and the
intervention itself as a way to improve the quality of cancer care for their patients. We will compare compliance
with treatment-related quality measures and the proportion of CoC standards of cancer care implemented in
target and control hospitals, pre- and post-intervention using a difference-in-difference estimator. This work
could lead to dissemination of similar models across rural settings thereby improving quality of care, reducing
rural disparities in cancer outcomes and giving rural hospitals an avenue to demonstrate their quality of care."

Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
10794256,"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) do not express estrogen receptor-α (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR),
or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and therefore, none of the targeted drugs currently in use
for breast cancer are effective against them. Approximately 60-80% of TNBCs express estrogen receptor-β
(ERβ). However, pro- versus anti-tumorigenic capabilities of ERβ remains controversial. Another key molecular
characteristic of TNBC is the high frequency (80%) of p53 mutation. In addition to losing tumor suppressor
properties and exerting dominant-negative regulation over any remaining wild type p53 (WTp53), mutant p53
also acquires oncogenic gain-of-function. Increasing evidence suggests that not all mutant p53s function
similarly. Although ERβ and p53 have been implicated in TNBC pathology, whether p53 has a role in the pro-
versus anti-proliferative functional duality of ERβ remains an open question. The long-term goal is to understand
and exploit the role of ERβ-p53 crosstalk in breast cancer for the development of better therapeutic strategies.
The objective is to study how specific mutations in p53 impinges upon ERβ function in TNBC, with the prediction
that specific p53 mutation will determine its role in the ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis impacting multiple
aspects of tumor progression and metastasis. The hypothesis is that ERβ binds to and inhibits both WTp53 and
mutant p53, leading to opposite effects on progression and therapeutic response of TNBC to agents such as
Tamoxifen (Tam). The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how ERβ elicits opposite
functions in a p53 status-dependent manner will be critical to stratify TNBC patients to repurpose established
therapeutic agents such as Tam to treat large percentage of TNBC patients. The specific aims are: (1 Determine
the interaction of different p53 mutants with p73 and ERβ in TNBC cells; (2) Analyze the differential effects of
p53 mutants on tumor progression, metastasis and therapeutic response in vivo; and (3) Evaluate the clinical
significance of the ERβ-p53-p73 signaling axis. In specific aim 1, Isogenic TNBC cells expressing different
combinations of ERβ and WT and p53 mutants generated using CRISPR technology and shRNA-mediated
conditional knockdown will be used for analyzing the mechanisms underlying the interaction and its impact on
cellular functions in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. In specific aim 2, the effect of different p53 mutations on
tumor growth and metastasis will be analyzed in vivo. The clinical relevance of these studies will be evaluated
using well-characterized patient derived xenografts (PDXs); patient tumor-derived organoids (PDOs); and patient
tumor tissues with linked clinical database (specific aim 3). The contribution of this research is expected to be
better understanding of the mechanisms by which ERβ-p53-p73 axis in the context of different p53 mutations
affects the disease progression and therapeutic response. The proposal is innovative because analyzing the
differential effects of different p53 mutations as part of an integrated ERβ-mutant p53-p73 signaling axis is a
departure from the status quo and has the potential of developing novel therapeutic strategies against TNBC."

The leading human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes over 700,000,000 cases of
superficial disease such as pharyngitis and pyoderma each year but can also lead to serious invasive infections
and autoimmune sequelae, which combine to make GAS one of top 10 causes of infection-associated deaths
worldwide. The highest mortality burden of GAS disease is caused by rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which
results from repeated bouts of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). It is difficult to overstate the urgent public health
need for a safe and efficacious GAS vaccine for human use. A significant number of experimental GAS vaccines
are backlogged in preclinical development, with questions around safety, global GAS strain coverage, potential
for efficacy in humans (i.e. lack of animal efficacy model data that accurately reflects disease). We have recently
demonstrated that choice of adjuvant plays a pivotal role in imparting protective efficacy for an experimental
multi-component GAS subunit vaccine in both a murine invasive disease model and the non-human primate
(NHP) model that closely recapitulates GAS pharyngitis, the primary target for vaccine protection. Moreover,
these studies suggest that promoting immunity skewed towards Th1 may elicits optimal protection beyond that
afforded by the standard Alum adjuvant formulation. Herein, our highly experienced team of scientists with an
extensive track record of productive collaboration will expand this important line of investigation to deliver proof-
of-concept of the impact of adjuvant on the efficacy of three leading experimental GAS vaccines: (1) a 30-valent
N-terminal M protein vaccine (StreptAnova) from the University of Tennessee that has reached phase 1 human
trials; (2) Vaxcyte VAX-AI from Vaxcyte, Inc. in collaboration with UC San Diego, a conjugate vaccine with
modified group A carbohydrate conjugate, and GAS proteins SLO, SpyAD, SCPA; and (3) Combo#5 from the
University of Queensland incorporating 5 conserved immunogenic GAS antigens: SLO, SCPA, SpyCEP, ADI,
TF. The vaccines will be formulated with Alum or selected emulsion and liposome-based adjuvants, using four
distinct mouse models (skin, intranasal, intraperitoneal and invasive disease). Protective efficacy, immune
response, correlates of protection, and vaccine safety (cross reactivity to human heart tissue) will be assessed.
Finally, protection afforded by three selected vaccine-adjuvant combinations will be assessed in the non-human
primate model of GAS pharyngitis, which most closely mimics GAS primary infection of humans, and clinical
scoring and vaccine safety parameters determined. To advance the entire GAS vaccine field, our head-to-head
comparison of M protein and non-M protein GAS vaccines, in both select mouse models and the NHP pharyngitis
model, will have broad implications. across the field. We will identify the most efficacious antigen and adjuvant
formulations using the animal models we have developed. Adjuvants that we identify will be available for use
with other GAS vaccines via the Vaccine Formulation Institute (Switzerland), a not-for-profit organization who
help guide advancement of effective formulations toward human trials and commercial use."

Humans diverge from other primates in numerous ways including their neuroanatomy and cognitive capacities.
Human-specific features are particularly prominent in the cerebral cortex, which has undergone an expansion in
size and acquired unique cellular composition and circuitry. Many of these features arose through modifications
to cortical development, explained by human-specific gene expression. However, how human-specific gene
expression explains divergent brain development is poorly understood. This proposal aims to fill that gap by
investigating how non-coding regulatory loci impact human-specific brain development. Specifically, we focus on
human accelerated regions (HARs), which are ultra-conserved sequences which have rapidly acquired
mutations in the human lineage. HARs frequently physically associate with neurodevelopmental genes, and at
least 50% of HARs have enhancer activity in human neural cells. Further, HARs are broadly associated with
neurological disorders. Yet, biological functions for HARs in brain development remain largely unknown.
Our group discovered HARE5, which shows divergent human-chimpanzee (Hs-Pt) enhancer activity in the
developing mouse brain, due to just 4 mutations over 600 conserved nucleotides. HARE5 activates expression
of Fzd8, a receptor in the WNT signaling pathway which is implicated in brain size and neurological disease. We
have generated humanized HARE5 mouse models which exhibit expanded progenitor and neuron number and
enlarged brains. We have additionally discovered new HARs, which like HARE5, are predicted to impact WNT
signaling. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that evolutionary modifications of HAR enhancer
activity modulate WNT signaling to control neural progenitor dynamics in the developing brain. Our
proposal leverages our expertise and unique genetic tools, including mouse models, and human and non-human
primate iPSCs and organoids. We will investigate mechanisms of HARE5 function in mouse models (Aim 1) and
in cortical organoids generated from human and non-human primate iPSCs (Aim 2). We will then test roles for
12 WNT-associated HARs in neurogenesis (aim 3). Upon completion of this study, we will gain valuable insights
into the developmental underpinnings of human cognitive capacities which can inform the basis for
neuropsychiatric diseases."

The Development Core is designed respond to the challenges of conducting population science 
research at the highest levels by investing in developing the human capital of population 
scholars and creating a culture and structure that contribute to the development of innovative 
interdisciplinary, high-impact population science research projects. Given the importance of the 
early stages of the career, many of the Core's activities focus on junior faculty, as part of a 
multi-dimensional program of mentoring. Seed grants and sustained engagement of mentors 
throughout the grant proposal writing, submission, review, and revision processes are key 
components. More generally, support from an engaging and innovative Development Core can 
also be critical as mid- and senior-level faculty pursue new ideas and continue their career-long 
developmental trajectories as scholars. The Development Core focuses on multiple activities. 
One is mentoring Early Stage Investigators (ESIs) in the preparation of competitive grant 
proposals through the mechanism of our regularly scheduled Grant Proposal Development 
Group (GPDG) that offers structured support for the preparation of NIH applications across the 
calendar year. A second is creating a Biological/Cognitive Technical Experts (BCTE) program to 
advise our faculty fellows, and particularly our ESIs, on key issues of judicious measurement 
and careful use of data that will be critical for proposal development and research productivity in 
the interdisciplinary space of population dynamics. Additionally, we will start a new Workshop 
for Innovation and Lightning-speed Discovery (WILD) program, which will facilitate the rapid 
development of new ideas and collaborations for CPC fellows at all stages of the research life 
course. Finally, we will provide a range of opportunities for CPC and external population 
scientists to present their work and to learn about the work of others at UNC and beyond. A key 
component of our Development Core over the next five years is the attention we have given to 
designing programs and mechanisms that will be as responsive as possible to the timely needs 
of researchers as they evolve and that will adjust in focus as needs change over the career 
trajectory."

Antibody-mediated graft rejection (AMR) remains a major barrier to successful solid organ transplantation.
Establishing novel treatment strategies based on our understanding of underlying mechanisms may improve
long term graft outcomes. Although pathogenic allo-antibodies mediating AMR are produced mainly by GC B
cells after induction by follicular T helper (Tfh) cells, regulation of this response is poorly understood. Insight into
mechanisms that regulate these GC responses and dampen AMR to improve heart allograft outcomes are
needed.
We have uncovered and exploited a central role for Qa-1-/HLA-E-restricted CD8 regulatory T cells in the control
of Tfh-dependent DSA responses against donor allografts. Our published and preliminary experimental data
indicate that CD8 Treg that are restricted by class Ib MHC (murine Qa-1/human HLA-E) can be mobilized by
synthetic FL9 peptides to inhibit alloimmune Tfh cells, dampen Ab-mediated injury and prolong heart allograft
survival in fully mismatched heart transplant models. These findings open the possibility of HLA-E-targeted
vaccine strategies that exploit the limited polymorphism of this MHC class Ib gene and avoid problems of class
Ia MHC diversity.
The FL9−Qa-1 complex is upregulated by a subset of activated Tfh cells that drive alloantibody responses.
Identification of synthetic FL9 agonist peptides that mobilize Ag-specific CD8 Treg after a screen of a yeast
peptide library based on the FL9 self-peptide is outlined in SA1. Analysis of mechanisms that underpin peptide-
induced regulation of AMR against heart allografts are addressed in SA2. Targeting of co-receptors that
modulate CD8 Treg activation and function are the subject of SA3. These studies should allow new and effective
approaches to reduce AMR and improve allograft survival."
10832497,"This Collaborative Merit Award application (CMA), consisting of three projects (CMA1-3), addresses a critical
challenge in the clinical management of ovarian cancer (OC). The most common and lethal subtype of OC is
high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). Standard treatment for HGSOC combines surgical
cytoreduction with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients diagnosed with HGSOC often suffer from disease
relapse associated with the emergence of chemotherapy resistance. The clinically necessary key to increasing
survival in HGSOC is to prevent the development of platinum resistance (PtR) or identify alternative means of
targeting PtR tumors. The main goal of this interdisciplinary and collaborative project is to identify novel targets
and biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy for HGSOC. This requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that
result in transformation of HGSOC cells to an aggressive, therapy-resistant phenotype. Increasing evidence
supports the hypothesis that a key contributor to PtR is the reprogramming of cancer cells into a less
differentiated and metabolically adaptable state. This collaborative proposal by three established OC researchers
will leverage their interdisciplinary expertise and rich resources to define new mechanisms of resistance in
OC. CMA1 will use digital spatial profiling and systems biology to provide a holistic understanding of PtR as well
as prioritize cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental clinically relevant underlying molecular pathways. Unique
preclinical immunocompetent mouse models and co-culture models will be used to study the role of the tumor
microenvironment in PtR. CMA2 will study metabolic adaptation associated with the emergence of PtR focusing
on a shift to fatty acid oxidation in PtR HGSOC tumors. CMA2 will use resources shared with CMA1&3 and
cellular biology and novel single cell metabolic imaging to define unique metabolic dependencies of PtR HGSOC.
As PtR tumors are highly susceptible to death induced by oxidized lipid membranes, mechanisms of ferroptosis
will be examined in PtR models treated with novel metabolism targeting agents, which will be tested
with CMA1. CMA3 will explore the reprogramming of recurrent HGSOC cells into more dedifferentiated tumor
subpopulations with neuroendocrine (NE)-like features. Mounting evidence in other tumors suggest progression
to a NE-like state results in therapy resistance - a concept yet to be explored in OC. To identify NE-like cells in
OC, the transcriptome, proteome, gene vulnerability, and drug sensitivity landscape of matched patient tumors
and model systems will be evaluated for the emergence of NE-like cells under chemotherapeutic pressures.
Existing drug dependency databases will be mined for identification of druggable targets in NE-like cells. Drugs
effective against these cells will be tested alone or in combination as targeted therapy for PtR OCs utilizing
patient derived organoid and xenograft models. Hallmarks of NE-like cells including metabolic adaptations and
histologic characteristics will be explored with CMA2 & CMA1 respectively.
CMA1 rationale: The evaluation of histopathology slides is the main method to establish a HGSOC diagnosis
and guide treatment decisions. However, the rich data embedded within histopathology slides have not been
fully exploited to understand the underlying causes of PtR and develop personalized treatment strategies. Prior
research on PtR mostly used cancer cell lines and focused on cell-intrinsic events. However, data from clinical
samples suggest that the tissue microenvironment (TME) is a major driver of PtR. Specifically, cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were shown to induce PtR in adjacent cancer cells. We hypothesize that higher-
order features extracted from pathology slide images are associated with distinct molecular profiles, such as
specific gene and protein expression, metabolism, and sensitivity to specific drugs. We will combine spatial
image profiling with assays in mouse models and CAF/cancer cell co-cultures to mechanistically dissect the
role of the TME in PtR. The integration of image data from patient slides with other -omics data will add a key
layer of information to prioritize biologically- and clinically-relevant biomarkers and drivers of PtR."

Vulnerability to substance abuse and addiction has a heritable component. In particular, family and twin studies
demonstrate that about 45-65% of the vulnerability to develop alcohol use disorder is determined by genetic
factors. In the past decade, advances in genetics have provided critical clues in the search for the molecular
basis of alcohol use and abuse. Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have expanded
dramatically in size and sophistication, which has led to hundreds of loci being implicated in a range of alcohol-
related traits. One major impediment to studies of alcohol use disorder is the complexity of the phenotype and
the lack of control of environmental variables. We propose a complementary and multidisciplinary approach
that combines next-generation sequencing with state-of-the-art behavioral screening in a unique, genetically
diverse, nonhuman animal model. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify gene variants that are
associated with increased vulnerability to compulsive alcohol use, tolerance and response to FDA approved
medications by performing a GWAS in N/NIH heterogeneous stock rats. We will use the most relevant animal
model of alcohol use disorder (i.e., escalation after chronic intermittent access to alcohol vapor) and highly
standardized measures of compulsive alcohol self-administration combined with longitudinal assessment of
withdrawal signs. To increase the impact of these findings and facilitate translational and basic research
studies on the mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use, we will also establish a data/tissue repository
from behaviorally and genetically characterized animals that will allow researchers to further investigate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use and identify the biological changes
associated with the expression of specific gene variants. This project is likely to have a sustained and powerful
impact on the field because it will (1) characterize the transition from controlled to compulsive alcohol use in
male and female outbred rats, (2) identify genes associated with compulsive alcohol use and the the response
to the currently FDA approved medications , (3) create the Alcohol BioBank which will provide free access to
brain, kidney, liver, spleen, ovary, testis, adrenal, and blood samples with a variety of tissue preservation
protocols that will allow the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells as well as neuroanatomical, molecular,
biochemical, and pharmacological studies on behaviorally/genetically characterized animals."

To ensure that each dividing cell receives a complete set of the correct genome, cell cycle checkpoints are in
place throughout the cell cycle. Yet, less is known about whether similar checkpoints exist for division of the
cytoplasmic components or organelles of the cell. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a gateway for the
secretory pathway, generating almost all of the secreted and cell surface membrane proteins as well as
synthesizing cellular lipids. Previously, we identified a cell cycle checkpoint, termed the ER stress surveillance
(ERSU) pathway, that ensures the inheritance of sufficient levels of functional ER in the model organism S.
cerevisiae. In response to ER stress, the ERSU pathway (1) blocks the inheritance of the stressed ER into the
daughter cell, (2) mislocalizes the septin ring from the bud neck, the site of cytokinesis, and ultimately, (3)
leads to temporary cell cycle arrest at cytokinesis until ER functional homeostasis is re-established. Cells that
lack components of the ERSU, and thus cannot mount the ERSU pathway, die upon ER stress, underscoring
the importance of this checkpoint. The ERSU pathway is distinct from the well-studied unfolded protein
response. We have found that levels of phytosphingosine (PHS), an early intermediate of sphingolipid
biosynthesis, increase upon ER stress, setting in motion the ERSU hallmark events. Moreover, we defined a
PHS binding motif that is found within two different transmembrane domains of reticulon family proteins (i.e.,
Rtn1 and Yop1), leading to the activation of the ERSU events. In the current proposal, in AIM 1, we will apply
molecular and cell biological approaches to dissect how PHS binding to Rtn1 or Yop1 results in ERSU
activation. In AIM 2, we will extend the scope of the ERSU by dissecting the impact of ER lipotoxic stress
induced by ER morphological changes, on the ERSU molecular events. In AIM 3, we will investigate how ER
stress impacts the mammalian cell cycle. As the nuclear membrane breaks down during mitosis in mammalian
cells, the division of functional ER may be even more tightly choreographed with the nuclear mitotic
mechanisms. Our preliminary result of a mammalian septin subunit holds great promise for the presence of
regulatory events that may share similarity to the yeast ERSU. Thus, we will fully investigate the impact of ER
stress on (A) the mammalian septin subunits and cytokinetic components, and (B) major mitotic cell cycle
structural changes that involve the ER, such as ER clearing from the “mitotic exclusion zone” and nuclear
disassembly and reassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that integrate ER homeostasis with
cell cycle events will provide unprecedented insights into human diseases caused by the failure of ER
regulation. ."
10754594,"Anxiety psychopathology is highly prevalent in people living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their care partners. Recent meta-
analyses suggest clinically significant anxiety symptoms in approximately 40% of those with
ADRD and approximately 25% in their care partners, as well as increased rates of anxiety in
clinical samples of patients with MCI. Moreover, a recent review suggests that elevated anxiety
is a marker for and potentially contributes to earlier onset of ADRD symptoms among those with
MCI. Despite this, there are no well-established interventions for anxiety in MCI/ADRD or their
care partners. Moreover, prior treatment protocols for anxiety are lengthy, excessively rely on
intact memory and cognitive abilities, and result in high dropout rates. Brief, mechanism focused
interventions offer an efficient, alternative approach to dealing with anxiety in people with
MCI/ADRD and their care partners. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is an extremely well-researched risk
mechanism relevant to the genesis and maintenance of anxiety and other forms of
psychopathology. AS acts as a broad stress amplification factor as it exacerbates the experience
of somatic and emotional sensations, leading to increased distress. As such, individuals with
elevated AS are more likely to experience exaggerated responses to a wide array of stressors
including cognitive symptoms (e.g., concentration and memory problems). Fortunately, focused
interventions have been developed showing that AS can be quickly and effectively reduced.
These interventions include psychoeducation but focus heavily on interoceptive exposure (IE)
exercises designed to reduce conditioned fear to anxiety-provoking internal stimuli. Across clinical
trials, evidence shows such interventions can markedly reduce AS and that these reductions
mediate reductions in anxiety symptoms. While AS interventions have been successfully used in
a variety of samples, they have not been tested for people with MCI/ADRD. We propose to
conduct a fully powered randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test a brief, CBT-based intervention,
called cognitive anxiety sensitivity treatment (CAST) for people with MCI/mild AD. We
believe the IE component of CAST will be particularly relevant to MCI/mild ADRD where learning
may be compromised due to cognitive decline. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that CAST
yields medium to high effect size reductions in AS and anxiety in older adults with MCI. Dyads
consisting of MCI/mild AD and their care partners will be randomized to CAST to a Health
Education Control (HEC) condition (N = 197) and followed for six months to evaluate change in
anxiety and distress, cognitive functioning and quality of life."

Sexual and gender minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer or other non-heterosexual or non-cis gender)
adults are a population that experiences significant mental and physical health disparities. This project
addresses sexual and gender minority health through a focus on the romantic relationship context of health,
specifically at the point of marriage. Legalized marriage is only newly available to sexual minority couples in
the United States as of 2015, but decades of research have demonstrated that marriage has health benefits for
heterosexual couples. Sexual and gender minority stress is a primary driver of health disparities for this
population and marriage may buffer or exacerbate minority stress experiences for couples. This longitudinal
study will examine the intersection of sexual minority stress and marriage. It will measure health at multiple
levels of analysis among recently-married sexual minority couples, inclusive of gender identity, across the first
two years of marriage through the following aims. 1) Through repeated quantitative surveys with sexual
minority couples (N=250 couples) over the first two years of marriage, we will examine changes in minority
stress, relationship processes, and physical and mental health, as well as relationship mediators and
moderators of the well-established link between minority stress and health. 2) Through longitudinal qualitative
interviews (N=24-30 couples enrolled from Aim 1), we will explore the evolving meaning of marriage over the
newlywed period, as well as perceptions of how marriage shapes minority stress. 3) Using a sub-set of couples
(N=100), we will repeatedly measure physiological markers of stress (cortisol, alpha amylase) and associations
with relationship interactions and minority stress in couples’ daily lives. This study will measure both self-
reported health and biological mediators of health at an important transition in sexual minority couples’ lives.
The proposed R01 is responsive to PAR-21-281 on dyadic processes and biopsychosocial health, NIH’s
Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Sexual and Gender Minority Health research (NOT-MD-19-001), and NIMHD’s
Scientific Vision. Our pilot data suggest that: 1) sexual minority individuals face unique challenges to healthy
relationship formation, 2) they appear to view marriage as a life choice in a fundamentally unique way, and 3)
marriage is a potentially critical context for understanding sexual minority couples’ mental and physical health.
The discoveries generated by this project will make important contributions to an unexplored and critical life
and relationship transition: marriage, which is uniquely shaped by the social context of sexual orientation and
has clear implications for the health of sexual minority couples."

Appetite suppressing agents secreted from the gut, such as cholecystokinin (CCK), play a critical role in
regulating feeding behavior. However, drugs based on CCK or its receptors failed to effectively treat obesity.
These drugs lack a specific neural target because the central neural mechanism underlying how peripheral CCK
regulates appetite is not fully understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the neural mechanisms that
regulate appetite and body weight, and to develop corresponding therapies to treat obesity and eating disorders.
Using novel genetic methods, we identified a specific population of central amygdala (CEA) neurons, marked by
the expression of protein kinase C delta (PKC-δ), that are necessary for the effect of CCK on appetite
suppression. We demonstrated that CEA PKC-δ neurons suppress feeding through inhibitory synaptic
connections with CEA PKC-δ negative neurons. However, the identity of CEA PKC-δ negative neurons and their
downstream targets for CCK-induced anorexia are unknown. The objective of this application is to determine the
neural circuits in the central brain areas that are downstream of CEA involved in regulating CCK-elicited feeding
suppression. The central hypothesis is that the intersectional brain regions, i.e. disynaptically disinhibited by
CEA PKC-δ neurons and activated by CCK, mediate CCK-induced feeding suppression and appetite control.
The rationale for the proposed research is that the identification of the central brain neural circuits for appetite
control will advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of CCK-induced anorexia and feeding control,
and suggest novel strategies for developing effective therapies to treat obesity and eating disorders. Guided by
strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: (1) Establish functional
circuitry connections from CEA PKC-δ neurons to the downstream targets. (2) Determine the role of the neurons
downstream of CEA PKC-δ negative neurons in CCK-induced feeding suppression. We will test the working
hypothesis that feeding is regulated by the neurons that are downstream of CEA PKC-δ negative neurons and
activated by CCK. (3) Determine the specific neural pathways through which CEA PKC-δ negative neurons
regulate the effect of CCK on feeding suppression. We will test the working hypothesis that neural circuits project
from CEA PKC-δ negative neurons to their downstream neurons to regulate CCK-elicited feeding suppression.
The innovation of the proposed research includes the intersectional approach of using unique genetic marker
labeling of neurons combined with a well-established appetite suppression agent to map the central brain neural
circuits for feeding regulation, and will develop and apply new tools to dissect functional-specific neural circuits.
Finally, the proposed research is significant because it will provide novel neural targets in the central brain
regions and determine their role in the neural axis of appetite control. Such knowledge has the potential to inform
the development of novel therapies that include specific neural targets to treat obesity and eating disorders."
10794261,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in
eukaryotes. Work carried out over the last 20 years has shed light on the mechanisms underlying hormone
and amino acid signaling to TORC1, but it is still unclear how other key signals, such as glucose starvation, are
transmitted to this highly conserved complex. In the last grant period, we examined TORC1 signaling in
budding yeast, and found that the PKC, Gcn2, Sit4, and CK2 signaling pathways work together with the GAP
SEAC (GATOR1/2 in humans) to inhibit TORC1 via the highly-conserved GTPases, Gtr1/2 (Rag A/B and C/D
in humans). This in turn releases TORC1 to move into a single inactive body at the edge of the
vacuole/lysosome—an event that depends on the TORC1 binding protein, Pib2. Building on this framework,
we now wish to: (1) Identify and characterize the proteins and pathways work in parallel with Gtr1/2 to regulate
TORC1, and (2) determine how the conserved Gcn2, PKC, Sit4, CK2 pathways, regulate TORC1 via Gtr1/2.
To address the first question, we purified TORC1 from cells exposed to a variety of stress and starvation
conditions, and identified numerous new interactors. The most notable are the uncharacterized
vacuolar/lysosomal membrane proteins Ydl180w, Ygr125w and Syg1, since they bind tightly to TORC1 and are
required for its movement into, or out of, the inactive bodies. We now propose to study the function of these
TORC1 binding proteins in detail, testing the hypotheses that: (i) Ydl180w is repressor of TORC1 and
competes with Gtr1/2 to control TORC1 activity, (ii) Ygr125w is a sulfur dependent activator of TORC1, and (iii)
Syg1 is a phosphate dependent activator of TORC1. To address the second question, we purified the major
Gtr1/2 regulator SEAC, and mapped its phosphorylation in glucose and nitrogen starvation conditions. This led
to the identification of over 150 phosphorylation sites, many of which are hyper- or hypo-phosphorylated during
glucose and/or nitrogen starvation. Building on these data, we now wish to test the hypothesis that the
conserved Gcn2, PKC, Sit4, CK2, and other kinases/phosphatases inhibit TORC1 by (de)phosphorylating and
activating SEAC. We also plan to explore a new connection we identified between the key serine synthesis
enzymes Ser3/33 (PHGDH in humans) and the TORC1 regulator Pib2—testing the hypothesis that Ser3/33
activate TORC1 via Pib2 in the presence, but not absence, of serine. Our proposal is innovative in that we
study new and unexplored aspects of TORC1 signaling using state-of-the-art systems, proteomic, and
biochemical approaches. The proposed research is significant in that it promises to shed light on the
mechanisms underlying cell growth control, and complex signal integration, in an important model organism—
with implications for (a) understanding TORC1 related diseases such as cancer, epilepsy, diabetes and
obesity, since many of the proteins and pathways under investigation are conserved and (b) developing drugs
that selectively block the growth of pathogenic fungi."
10793660,"Summary: PGAM5 in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and carcinogenesis
(PI: Andrea Johnston, DVM, PhD).
The broad objective of this project is to determine whether changes in mitochondrial metabolism
mechanistically influence the transition from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD is emerging as a leading cause of HCC. HCC survival
outcomes are poor. Defining the bioenergetic pathophysiology of NAFLD and its progression to
HCC will identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial membrane protein
phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) regulates an array of mitochondrial homeostatic pathways.
Recent research shows that depletion of PGAM5 prevents both high fat diet (HFD) induced
obesity and the progression of HCC. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that distinct
mitochondrial metabolic pathways are responsible for these effects. A liver specific knockout
mouse will be generated to determine whether hepatocyte specific loss of PGAM5 will inhibit
steatosis in a HFD model. Single cell RNA sequencing of a human HCC cell line will determine if
PGAM5 depletion alters gene expression associated with hepatic lipid metabolism. HCC
spheroids will be used to characterize how loss of PGAM5 modulates mitochondrial respiration
and glycolysis in a steatosis model. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine whether
PGAM5 knockout inhibits hepatocellular steatosis. Aim 2 will determine whether PGAM5 deletion
alters mitochondrial metabolism in HCC leading to increased reactive oxygen species production."
10927199,"ABSTRACT - Revealing environmental chemical exposome in a diverse prenatal population and
relationships to maternal and perinatal health (REVEAL)
Our renewal application builds on our original R01 by advancing analytical chemistry and computational
techniques to characterize more fully the prenatal chemical exposome and its links to adverse maternal and
perinatal health outcomes (e.g., gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low birthweight). Prevalence of these
outcomes has increased and is linked to chemical exposures in the US population. Prenatal exposures to a
broad range of environmental chemicals, including plastic related chemicals and per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS), have been shown to adversely affect health, but technological challenges have left
significant data gaps hindering our ability to characterize environmental exposures and drivers of disease.
Over 350,000 chemicals and compound mixtures are registered for production worldwide, and thousands of
high–production volume chemicals are used extensively in the US, yet human biomonitoring capacity covers a
very small fraction of the chemical exposome. In our previous R01 we pioneered a nontargeted analysis (NTA)
workflow, with significantly improved computational and analytical methods using high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) in a demographically diverse population of maternal-newborn pairs. We were the first to
identify multiple chemicals in maternal and newborn sample used in high volumes in the US not previously
detected in human blood samples including chemicals used in personal care products and fragrances,
production of plastics, surfactants, and stain treatment. We also identified over 50 novel chemicals with limited
to no information on their uses or sources and found significant associations between exogenous and
endogenous compounds, several chemical groups (siloxanes, PFAS, and chemicals used in plastics and
rubber) and biomarkers of lipid metabolism and regulation, supporting a link to gestational diabetes. For our
renewal project, we propose to expand our study population by analyzing an additional 750 2nd trimester
pregnancy samples, 300 of the samples matched to our original 3rd trimester samples. We will contribute to
improved understanding of the prenatal chemical exposome by integrating NTA with improved computational
methods including a chemical suspect database ~1,000,000 exogenous and endogenous chemical features in
combination with upgraded software for supercomputing to identify ~500 chemical prenatal exposures and
estimate their concentrations using new machine learning algorithms. We will use this data to characterize
complex relationships between multiple exogenous chemical exposures, endogenous effect biomarkers, and
maternal and perinatal health outcomes. The overarching goal of this renewal is to develop an integrated
package of analytic and computational tools that allow expanded capacity to identify and calculate chemical
concentrations and their link to adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes, critical to information public health
interventions to prevent harmful chemical exposures."

 Mammalian locomotion is an essential behavior for mobility and survival. Locomotion involves
coordinated and alternating rhythmic activity between opposing limbs, as well as between antagonistic muscles
of the same limb. The locomotor central pattern generator (CPG), a network of spinal interneurons, is thought to
produce the locomotor pattern and rhythm and directly activate motor neurons, which in turn activate peripheral
muscles resulting in movement. We have recently reported that a set of spinal interneurons, known as ventral
spinocerebellar tract (VSCT) neurons, are both necessary and sufficient for locomotor behavior in neonatal and
adult mice. VSCT neurons possess two rhythmogenic properties, namely the exhibit an Ih current and they are
electrically coupled. Additionally, they possess spinal axon collaterals within the same spinal segment as well as
extra-segmentally. VSCTs are also contacted by motor neuron axon collaterals and they are electrically coupled
to them, at least during early postnatal development. VSCTs in turn, connect with other spinal interneurons
involved in the locomotor central pattern generator, via their axon collaterals. Our published observations provide
a strong foundation to dissect further their cellular characteristics and their neuronal circuits that they form with
other spinal neurons, including motor neurons. We hypothesize that both cellular characteristics in VSCTs and
the spinal neuronal targets contacted by VSCTs’ axon collaterals will be key determinants for locomotor behavior
in mice. In Aim 1, we will study the contribution of the HCN channels responsible for the Ih current in VSCTs and
determine the role of several connexins that we have identified through our preliminary results in their role as
key neurons in locomotor rhythmogenesis. To do so, we will utilize conditional knock out mice, whole-cell patch
clamp protocols along with pharmacological studies, immunohistochemistry, and virally-mediated channel
knockdown. In Aim 2, we will study the neuronal connectivity of VSCTs with Chx10+, Sim1+ and motor neurons.
We will investigate their functional role in these connections utilizing mouse genetics, behavioral assays,
physiological approaches and viral-mediated approaches to map out some of the key neuronal circuits involved
in locomotor behavior. Furthermore, we will employ a novel “clearing” technique together with 2-photon laser
confocal microscopy to image the entire spinal cord of neonatal and adult mice to uncover the relationship
between VSCTs and their potential neuronal targets within the spinal cord and across many different spinal
segments. In Aim 3, we will establish whether a novel set of transcription factors marking this class of spinal
interneurons can be manipulated by chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches and determine their involvement
in locomotor-like behavior. In summary, this comprehensive set of experiments will provide a solid foundation to
further our understanding of spinal locomotor networks."

This project addresses the current lack of quantifiable and clinically relevant imaging endpoints for use in
patient-derived organoid models. Microphysiological tumor models (μPTMs) are tissue-engineered 3D tumors
that can be grown inside microfluidic devices to form multicellular tissue-like constructs that retain the
biological and functional characteristics of the tissue of origin. These μPTMs provide a powerful model of
individual patients’ tumor and are used in drug discovery, cancer research, and personalized medicine.
However, a critical hurdle remains that, unlike xenotransplanted tumors, μPTMs are incompatible with positron
emission tomography (PET) and other diagnostic imaging tools used in oncology. There is a dearth of
quantitative imaging methods that can be applied seamlessly across physical scales, ranging from in vitro cell
cultures to animal models and cancer patients. Drawing from extensive preliminary work, we will bridge this
gap by harnessing the ability of radioluminescence microscopy (RLM) to image clinical radionuclides in
organoids with ultra-high spatial resolution. Upon completion, this project will enable routine imaging of in vitro
tumor models using the growing array of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, many of which are
used as clinical standard of care. This goal will be achieved by pursuing three specific aims. First, we will
demonstrate that quantitative image-based metrics can be acquired using PET tracers in patient-derived
organoids. Validation will be conducted for three PET tracers against mouse xenograft models derived from the
same set of cancer patients. Second, we will refine the μPTMs by incorporating functional (perfusable) human
microvascular networks within the 3D matrix and, using imaging and other assays, determine the effect of the
vasculature on image-based endpoints. Third, as a pilot translational study, we will develop patient-specific
μPTMs (n=10) and compare fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolic activity in these organoids against
biomarkers derived from clinical FDG-PET. In sum, this project will enhance the ability of researchers to run
clinical trials “on a chip”, using the patient’s own tumor and clinically approved radiopharmaceuticals.
Ultimately, these advances could be translated to predict the efficacy of new drugs, test biological hypotheses,
and individualize patient therapy."

10808950,"ABSTRACT
Homologous recombination reshuffles genetic information between parental chromosomes generating genetic
diversity and driving evolution. Recombination predominantly occurs at recombination hotspots, the narrow
genomic regions where recombination frequency exceeds the frequency in the adjacent areas by up to three
orders of magnitude. In some species, hotspots localize opportunistically to the regions with open chromatin
configuration, such as promoters, enhancers and CpG islands. In others, including humans and mice, hotspots
are routed away from these functional elements by the PRDM9 protein, protecting them from mutagenic effects
of recombination. Deletion of the Prdm9 gene results in relocation of hotspots from PRDM9 binding sites back
to promoters, leading to sterility or subfertility in mice and rats, but seemingly not in humans. This means that
recombination-induced mutations in functional genomic elements will be passed to progeny. Furthermore,
since locations of recombination hotspots change dramatically in Prdm9 mutants, the established patterns of
linkage disequilibrium will be broken, leading to novel allele combinations. Therefore, investigation of the
consequences of the Prdm9 loss in species that naturally lost Prdm9 through evolution is of particular interest.
In this study we will map recombination hotspots in three species that lost canonical Prdm9 and examine three
specific mechanisms that may define recombination landscape in such species."
10767321,"Project Summary: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are prevalent developmental disorders, defined by
impairments in social interactions and communication as well as restricted, repetitive behaviors. The majority of
individuals with ASD exhibit a range of co-morbid symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Up to
91% of people with ASD have chronic GI problems, and GI issues are emphasized as major concerns by patients
and clinicians. GI dysfunction is thought to contribute to core ASD symptoms, as patients with chronic GI pain
exhibit increased social withdrawal, irritability, and stereotyped behaviors. Despite the prevalence and impact of
GI issues in ASD, little is known regarding the extrinsic neural circuits that modulate GI function, the etiology of
GI abnormalities in ASD, and whether GI deficits are mechanistically linked to core ASD symptoms.
 Sensory information from the gut is conveyed to the central nervous system (CNS) by two extrinsic
pathways of vagal and spinal sensory afferents whose cell bodies are within the nodose and dorsal root ganglia
(DRG), respectively. GI-innervating DRG neurons are critical for normal GI function, yet little is known about the
development and function of these neurons. Further, we have little understanding of how GI signals are encoded,
processed, and represented in the spinal cord.
 In our prior studies, we found that DRG neurons are key sites at which ASD-associated gene mutations
have a critical impact. We showed how aberrant function of DRG neurons that innervate the skin cause over-
reactivity to light touch, and can link multiple ASD phenotypes, including social deficits and anxiety-like
behaviors. We hypothesize that similar over-reactivity to ‘viscerosensory’ signals from the GI system contributes
to ASD symptoms. We further hypothesize that these DRG neurons that connect the GI tract and CNS are critical
sites of dysfunction in ASD. While significant progress has been made to understand brain-specific mechanisms
and circuits underlying ASD pathology, there is a substantial need to understand the contributions of peripheral
neuron and spinal cord circuit disruptions to ASD phenotypes.
 This proposal aims to investigate the development and function of GI-innervating DRG neurons and
determine the mechanisms through which a key sensory modality, viscerosensation of the GI tract, may be
altered in mouse models for ASD. Our first goal is to characterize the development and function of colon-
innervating DRG neurons, and determine whether ASD-associated gene mutations cause anatomical and
functional disruptions to colon-innervating DRG neurons. Our second goal is to investigate whether DRG neuron
dysfunction triggers abnormal GI function, aberrant encoding of GI signals in the spinal cord, and increased GI
pain in mouse models for ASD. Lastly, we will test whether test whether a combination of environmental factors
(gut dysbiosis) and genetic factors (ASD-associated gene mutations) results in GI-innervating DRG neuron
dysfunction and GI pain, and ultimately, contributes to anxiety-like behaviors and social impairments in ASD."
10772020,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Kenya has a high incidence of breast and cervical cancers, and most women are diagnosed with late-
stage disease. Implementing effective programs to screen and detect these cancers at an early stage could
substantially decrease the high mortality. Kenya has been increasing access to cancer screening, but less
than one-sixth of eligible women have ever received breast and cervical cancer screening.
 The goal of the study is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multicomponent strategies
to increase the uptake of breast and cervical cancer screeening. A key gap that perpetuates the low
screening rates in Kenya is the lack of community–clinic linkages. There is evidence that women are often
unaware of the screening services offered in facilities, and, even among those who are aware, there is lack
of motivation, anticipated or perceived stigma, and reduced self-efficacy to undergo screening. We will
conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the screening outcomes, including screening
uptake, diagnostic test completion, and treatment initiation and implementation outcomes to support scale-
up. We will test two multicomponent packages of strategies: (1) Cancer Community–Clinic Linkage (C3Link)
Core: Community health volunteer (CHV)-delivered group education for women and family members to
increase screening uptake in the community setting and practice facilitation to improve the screening
process and develop team-based care with CHV participation in the clinic setting; (2) C3Link Plus: C3Link
Core strategies along with a sequential series of individual strategies that increase in intensity at 3-month
intervals; women who remain unscreened will first receive one-on-one education; second, motivational
interviewing; and, finally, navigation to address specific barriers.
 We will implement the study across 27 communities in Kenya to address the following three specific
aims: Aim 1: Conduct a cluster randomized trial to assess short-term (intervention implementation phase)
and longer-term impacts (maintenance phase) of the two packages of multicomponent strategies on breast
and cervical cancer screening outcomes along the continuum of care compared to enhanced standard of
care (communities receiving a messaging campaign only); Aim 2: Use a mixed-methods approach to assess
and compare multilevel implementation outcomes of the package of strategies focusing on acceptability,
feasibility, appropriateness, fidelity, and sustainability; Aim 3: Perform cost-effectiveness and return-on-
investment analysis to support scale-up of an effective package of implementation strategies across Kenya
and other sub-Saharan African countries. The Kenyan Ministry of Health can use the findings from this study
to design optimal approaches and plan investments in screening infrastructure to scale up implementation of
guideline recommendations. The lessons learned can be applied to other sub-Saharan African settings."
10817857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
American Indian populations have greater burden of cerebrovascular and Alzheimer’s disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) comorbidities compared with non-Hispanic White U.S. populations and may also have
greater burden of cognitive decline and dementia. Bilingualism—common in American Indian communities—
may enhance working memory capacity, attentional control, and cognitive reserve, thus reducing cognitive risk.
However, bilingualism is a highly individual experience, and the context of use can modify its cognitive effects.
Factors that may influence this association include age, sex, vocabulary, physical and mental status,
socioeconomic status, culture, and social activity. Comprehensively assessing the relationship between
bilingualism and cognitive performance may be critical to fully understanding ADRD in American Indian adults.
Although the link between bilingualism and cognitive reserve has been studied in many populations,
bilingualism research in American Indian populations has been limited, due in part to critical cofactors related
to their experiences, perspectives, and standardized assessments. Unjust United States (U.S.) federal policies
affecting American Indian people included forced attendance at English-speaking boarding schools where use
of Native languages was punished, and cultural assimilation was prioritized over quality of education. As a
result, bilingualism in American Indian adults who attended such schools may present differently than for other
populations. Indeed, NIA (RFA-AG-23-001) defines bilingualism as “proficiency in two or more languages”,
however no validated, detailed assessment of proficiency exists for U.S. Native languages, or for American
Indian speakers of those languages. Our proposed study will be the first to culturally adapt a language use and
history instrument in a large, heterogeneous American Indian population. In response to RFA-AG-23-001, we
will leverage the Strong Heart Study, a large, longitudinal, heterogeneous, population-based study of aging in
American Indian adults over 3 geographic regions (N=2,500). In this proposed work, we will build on this study,
as well as our prior work, to assess the continuum of bilingualism in American Indian peoples by culturally
adapting the Language History Questionnaire, evaluate bilingualism in American Indians of multiple
generations in association with a detailed cognitive performance battery, and construct conceptual models to
assess intervariable relationships including effect modification and moderation by crystallized cognition. This
project will illuminate questions of public health significance in a vulnerable population that remains
underrepresented in ADRD research, with potential implications for future prevention and treatment strategies."
10912435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary involvement occurs in up to 90% of sarcoidosis cases, the disease course is heterogeneous and
respiratory failure is the leading cause of sarcoidosis-related mortality in the US. Most studies undertaken to date
in sarcoidosis compare cases to healthy or disease controls. There are knowledge gaps in the understanding
of sarcoidosis subtypes including the underlying molecular features, biologic pathways and mechanisms of
progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis disease progression. As a result, there are no clinical tools available for early
prediction of progressive (P) sarcoidosis to allow closer clinical follow-up, early treatment and to provide focus
for research. The goal of this project is to enroll sarcoidosis patients to define molecular characteristics of P-
sarcoidosis that will (a) enable early identification of patients at higher risk of progression. To develop tools for
rapid identification and prediction of P-sarcoidosis progression, this project will investigate molecular signatures
(proteins and genes ) and related biological pathways identified in a laboratory model of sarcoidosis granulomas
and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with P- vs non-progressive (NP)- sarcoidosis. (b)
provide insights into the different biological mechanisms driving outcomes in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Our
promising pilot data identified protein and transcriptional pathways engaged during granulomatous inflammation
and in PMBCs in proxies of P- and NP-sarcoidosis. Aim 1 builds on preliminary findings, characterizing
differences in P- and NP-sarcoidosis protein and gene pathways, leveraging the unique granuloma model. We
include single cell-RNA-Sequencing in a subset of cases with innovative digital cytometry methods to obtain cell-
specific pathways. Aim 2 will define pathways and signatures from PBMCs, which are recruited and contribute
to granuloma development and persistence as well as features that are shared and distinct from the model. Aim
3 will leverage findings from PMBCs and the in vitro model and clinical disease manifestations using innovative
bioinformatics approaches to construct and internally validate a comprehensive classifier that incorporates
proteins, clinical variables and patient-reported outcomes in a Discovery Cohort. The investigators will validate
this classifier in an independent Validation Cohort of subjects already enrolled by the research team in prior NIH
funded studies. The study uses novel approaches to characterize P-sarcoidosis and a diverse research team
led by MPIs with complementary expertise. The integration of sarcoidosis investigators from different locations
across the country will advance and sustain the sarcoidosis research through highly innovative translational
studies implementing state-of-the-art clinical and biological systems-level studies in a high-priority area of
research in sarcoidosis. These studies will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at evaluating this
classifier in longitudinal and patient care studies to identify an at-risk sarcoidosis population that may require
closer follow up and earlier treatment, and research pertaining to the identification of novel mechanistic pathways
and therapeutic targets contributing to P-sarcoidosis."
10757941,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related neurodegeneration (TReND) is increasingly recognized as a major health
concern and cause of cognitive decline. Neuroinflammation, a proposed mechanism of TReND, may persist for
years after the primary injury. We propose that chronic intestinal dysbiosis after TBI, specifically the depletion of
“healthy” commensal bacteria capable of fermenting dietary fiber to produce the short chain fatty acid (SCFA)
acetate, leads to a maladaptive state of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Microbially-derived acetate is the most
abundant SCFA in the gut, enters the circulation, and is critical to brain and immune function. Depletion of
acetate-producing bacteria is a consistent finding in critically ill humans and corresponding murine models.
Restoration of depleted bacteria or their metabolites has the potential to reverse dysbiosis-associated
phenotypes. Through a unique collaboration between internationally recognized centers for TBI and microbiome
research, The Safar Center for Resuscitation Research, The Center for Medicine and the Microbiome, and the
Neurotrauma Clinical Trials Center at the University of Pittsburgh, and The Biomedical Discovery Institute at
Monash University, we have generated exciting data which demonstrates (1) depletion of acetate-producing
bacterial populations in the gut after severe TBI in patients and controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI in mice, (2)
a marked reduction in fecal acetate after CCI, (3) progressive and sustained disruption of commensal bacteria
and acetate production weeks after injury, (4) repletion in drinking water or a dietary strategy to target gut
microbiota to deliver SCFAs is protective. Thus, we propose a translational study to discover if TReND and
chronic neuroinflammation after TBI is fueled by depletion of commensal bacteria and deficient fermentation of
dietary fiber. In Aim 1, we will address the hypothesis that deficiency of microbially-derived acetate contributes
to TReND up to 6 months from injury. We will employ CCI in male and female mice and compare untreated
controls (acetate deficient) to mice repleted using acetylated-fiber or gavage of acetate-producing bacteria.
Assessments of lesion volume, memory, surviving neurons, and brain energy metabolism will be performed. Gut
microbiome structure and function and acetate level in brain tissue, serum, and feces will be analyzed. In Aim
2, we will determine whether deficiency of acetate promotes chronic microglial activation and polarization to a
tissue-destructive phenotype as assessed by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq. In Aim 3, we will address
the hypothesis that TBI results in a reproducible, progressive, and sustained decrease in gut derived acetate.
We will perform an observational study of adults with moderate and severe TBI. Clinical information including
injury severity, antibiotics, diet, and neurologic outcome will be collected for secondary outcomes. Identifying a
role of stable alterations to the gut microbiome and robust effects of a promising and translatable therapy,
acetate, as a therapeutic target in humans by four highly complementary research centers will establish
disruption of the microbiome-gut-brain axis as a TReND mechanism and provide a foundation for clinical trials."
10734073,"Project Summary/Abstract:
As the life expectancy of the human population continues to rise, and with the number of people aged 65 years
and over projected to double over the next 30 years (16), the prevalence of age-dependent malignancies will
continue to increase significantly. This is especially true for hematologic malignancies, which combined
(leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma) comprise amongst the most prevalent new cancer
cases each year, and for which age is the most significant risk factor (17) (18). Current hypotheses suggest
that this late onset of malignancy is due to alterations in hematopoietic function and output over time, thus
making the study of aging hematopoiesis of critical importance to understanding and treating these diseases
(19) (3) (20) (5). The aging HSC is subject to stem cell exhaustion- characterized by a decline in self-renewal,
an uneven distribution of blood cell output (leading to a skew towards myeloid cell production), an
accumulation of DNA damage that goes unrepaired, and an increased frequency of clonal hematopoiesis,
which can lead to proliferation and production of cells that stem from an unfit parent population (21) (22) (23)
(24) (25). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a multi-faceted lipid messenger involved in various physiological and
pathophysiological processes, which have been shown to be especially critical for homeostatic maintenance of
the hematopoietic system (6-12). We have previously characterized 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase
(15-PGDH), the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step of PGE2 degradation, as a novel therapeutic
target to augment tissue regeneration in models of bone marrow (BM) transplantation (13) (14). Notably, we
have demonstrated that 15-PGDH inhibition (15-PGDHi) following murine hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation using aged donor and recipient mice results in accelerated multi-lineage peripheral blood
recovery and an enhanced recovery of hematopoietic stem cells. These findings have further established the
positive role of PGE2 and the negative role of 15-PGDH in organ self-renewal. We thus hypothesize a) that 15-
PGDH is a negative regulator of age-related hematopoietic development, b) that genetic loss of 15-PGDH will
result in superior organ fitness with age, and c) that PGDHi using our small molecules may be a viable
therapeutic strategy to treat hematopoietic age-related malignancies. Overall, this proposal provides clear
rationale to further explore the role of 15-PGDH on organ fitness with age and to explore the technique
of modulating PGE2 levels in models of age-related disease."
10893942,"The regulation of cell-cell junctions is essential for the biological functions of various tissues such as epithelium
and endothelium. Recent evidence in embryonic development and vascular physiology suggests that cell-cell
junctions are regulated by cell chirality, a universal but fundamental property of the cell. We pioneer in
research in cell chirality using engineered in vitro platforms. Here, using these platforms, we are to investigate
the biophysical mechanism associated with chirality at cell-cell junctions. While the principle may be shared
among many cell types, this study will focus on endothelial cells and the regulation of vascular permeability.
The endothelial cell layer is a semi-permeable barrier that tightly controls the passage of proteins and cells in
the bloodstream into the interstitial space and regulates the local environment of biological tissues in living
organisms. Cells achieve this vital function primarily through mediating paracellular transport by controlling the
opening and closure of cell-cell junctions. Protein Kinase C (PKC) activation has been associated with
endothelial dysfunction in chronic conditions such as diabetes and long-term smoking as well as acute
diseases such as sepsis, acute lung injury, and viral infection. Restoring and maintaining vascular integrity is
critical for body function and patient survival, especially for acute diseases. Recently, we have demonstrated
that PKC can reverse cell chirality, which mediates endothelial permeability. However, little is known about the
molecular mechanism of how PKC activation reverses endothelial chirality or that of how cell chirality alters
endothelial permeability. In this proposal, we hypothesize that PKC reverses cell chirality by reducing the level
of actin crosslinking and that cell chirality regulates cell-cell junctions (and therefore endothelial permeability)
biomechanically through actin tilting and VE-cadherin localization. We will pursue the following three aims: Aim
1. Identify the timing and location of biomechanical asymmetry responsible for multicellular chiral
morphogenesis using traction force microscopy (TFM). Combing 2D micropatterning for cell chirality and TFM
for cellular forces, we are to study in great detail of 2D collective symmetry breaking and to interrogate
underlying cellular biomechanical mechanisms. Aim 2. Determine cytoskeletal mechanisms underlying PKC
induced reversal of endothelial cell chirality. We will identify formin isoforms and actin crosslinkers involved in
this process, and their regulation by PKC signaling. Aim 3. Investigate the role of chirality mismatch in the
intercellular gap formation and endothelial permeability. We will quantify actin structure and dynamics during
the intercellular junctions and examine how the mismatch of cell chirality can lead to actin remodeling and
induce intercellular gap formation.
If successful, we will be able to identify the biophysical mechanisms, allowing for the potential development of
novel, specific therapies based on cell chirality for endothelial dysfunction. With data obtained from this
proposal, we will seek further support and examine our findings with animal models."
10841545,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is revolutionizing the diagnosis of rare diseases. However, at present, even
the most powerful approaches to etiological discovery typically fail to ﬁnd a genetic cause in a majority of partici-
pants (Turro et al., Nature 2020). There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, rare disease studies are typically
composed of small sets of unresolved cases, each sharing a different genetic etiology, which constrains statistical
power when only WGS and clinical phenotype data are available on participants. Secondly, the unknown causal
variants may have molecular consequences that are challenging to predict computationally, such as disruptions to
the regulatory elements (REs) of a gene or the introduction of a cryptic splice site. Thirdly, some types of causal
mutations, such as structural variants, are prone to being missed by WGS. Systematic, transcriptomic proﬁling of
homogeneous cell populations taken from rare disease patients has the potential to overcome these limitations.
We have access to a collection of ⇠1,000 comprehensively phenotyped rare disease study participants with WGS
and RNA-seq of platelets, neutrophils, monocytes and CD4+ T-cells. Here, we present a research program of
statistical, computational and experimental approaches to uncover novel etiologies of rare diseases that exploits
the high dimensionality and the hierarchical nature of these data. We will concentrate on the etiologies under-
lying ⇠300 cases with a rare platelet disorder (RPD), exploiting our expertise in blood genomics. In Aim 1, we
will develop a Bayesian method for identifying rare disease-causing rare variants in REs, treating expression as a
molecular mediator of genetic etiology. Our approach models the causal path between rare variants that overlap
cell type-speciﬁc REs, the corresponding cell type-speciﬁc changes in expression, and the consequent alteration
in rare disease risk. To include a recently discovered class of enhancer marked by H3K122ac but not H3K27ac
in our hypothesis search space, we will generate H3K122ac data on the relevant cell types from healthy donors.
In Aim 2, we will apply several approaches for identifying pathogenic changes in transcript sequences. For ex-
ample, we will apply recently developed methodology for identifying splicing outliers within the cohort. To ensure
these outliers are extreme in the wider population, we will compute splicing frequency spectra in large RNA-seq
datasets such as GTEx. These spectra will capture the population distribution of the within-individual proportion
of RNA-seq reads for a gene that include a given splice junction. We will also exploit the joint availability of WGS
and RNA-seq in patients to identify extreme allelic imbalances at WGS-called heterozygote sites. The candidate
variants that we identify will be validated in cell lines and primary samples. Rare diseases collectively affect one
in 20 people but current etiological knowledge cannot resolve half of patients by WGS alone. The modeling and
analysis of large-scale, patient-derived RNA-seq data on multiple cell types as molecular mediators of disease
risk can ﬁll this gap. The methodological and etiological output of our research program will ultimately boost the
diagnostic power of WGS and broaden the scope of precision medicine."
10873685,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death among US Latinas. Latinas are at high risk of obesity
and obesity-related diseases, which are associated with poorer cancer outcomes. There is a significant lack of
an effective intervention to address the diverse needs of Latina BC survivors to achieve a healthy weight. We
have developed and tested multi-component weight loss, dietary change, and physical activity (PA)
interventions among BC survivors, with a focus on experiential learning (EL) among Latinas. As the next step,
we propose a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) testing 12 month adaptive culturally-
tailored weight loss interventions in a geographically diverse group of Latina BC survivors. The adaptive
interventions will use the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program,
as the central educational component. Based on our prior work, we will adapt the DPP to be remotely
delivered, include information specific to BC survivors, and be culturally-tailored to Latinas. Women will be
recruited via 3 West Coast SEER registries. Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of stage I-III BC within 5 years, no
evidence of recurrent disease, >60 days post-treatment, and body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2. Baseline, 1, 3,
6, and 12 month assessments will include questionnaires on medical history, diet, and patient-reported
psychosocial/quality of life outcomes; objectively measured weight; accelerometer measured PA; and dried
blood spots to measure inflammatory/cardiometabolic biomarkers. Qualitative interviews with a subset of
participants will take place at 1 and 12 months. The goal of the 12 month ¡Vida! (Life!) program is to achieve
7% weight loss. Following baseline assessments, participants (n=410) will be randomized to ¡Vida! or ¡Vida! +
EL. At 1 month, responders (2% weight loss) will continue with their intervention and non-responders (<2%
weight loss) will be re-randomized to receive augmented behavioral support (i.e., combinations of EL,
individualized health coaching, and delivered groceries). Aim 1) To compare the effectiveness of four adaptive
interventions for weight loss in Latina BC survivors, beginning with ¡Vida! or ¡Vida! + EL (Stage 1) followed by
augmented behavioral support for 11 months for non-responders (Stage 2). Aim 2) To use a novel data-driven
approach to determine whether key individual baseline characteristics moderate the effect of the adaptive
interventions on weight loss, and thus lay the groundwork for more personalized adaptive weight loss
strategies. Exploratory Aims will i) assess whether intervention engagement moderates the effect of the
adaptive interventions on weight loss; ii) compare the effects of adaptive interventions on changes in
inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers, diet quality, and PA; iii) quantitatively assess biopsychosocial
predictors/mediators of behavior change; and iv) qualitatively assess the participant experience to understand
factors that contribute to study outcomes. The trial will generate evidence on the best strategies for an
effective, scalable weight loss program to promote healthy cancer survivorship among Latina BC survivors."
10871808,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to define the metabolic and molecular basis of fatty liver disease (FLD), a burgeoning
health problem with few therapeutic options. Fatty liver disease has been a major focus of our laboratory since
2004, when we undertook the first survey of hepatic triglyceride (TG) content (HTGC) in a population-based
sample of different ancestries, the Dallas Heart Study (DHS). Hepatic steatosis was found to be strongly
influenced by ancestry (Hispanics>European>African) and adiposity, but varied widely even among individuals
who were matched for ancestry and body mass index (BMI). We used human genetics to identify the first and
most clinically impactful genetic risk factor variant for FLD: PNPLA3(148M). This variant confers susceptibility to
the full spectrum of both alcoholic and nonalcoholic FLD. In the same study in which we identified
PNPLA3(148M), we also identified another variant in PNPLA3, S453I, that is associated with reduced HTGC;
this variant is present almost exclusively in individuals of African descent, the group with the lowest prevalence
of FLD. These two variants together account for ~70% of ancestry-related differences in HTGC.
 Despite having made significant progress elucidating the pathogenic mechanism of the 148M variant, and
having performed successful proof-of-concept studies in mice of potential therapeutic avenues to combat the
effects of 148M, important questions regarding the pathobiology of the variant and how it is related to FLD remain
unanswered or disputed. Accordingly, we will focus this application on three critical questions: 1) How does
PNPLA3(148M) evade ubiquitylation and degradation? 2) How does the 148M variant impair TG hydrolysis?
and 3) How does PNPLA3-S453I lower hepatic TG content and protect against FLD? Each of these questions
constitutes a Specific Aim. We will take advantage of cutting edge technologies to overcome important limitations
in prior methods used by us and others to address these questions. In AIM 1 we will use a CRISPR/Cas9
inactivation screen to identify the E3-ligase that ubiquitylates PNPLA3. In AIM 2 we will use a highly tunable
system to control protein expression at the level of translation, and a sensitive, luciferase reconstitution assay to
biochemically define the interactions among PNPLA3, ATGL, and ABHD5 at physiologically relevant
concentrations in cells. In AIM 3 we will develop the first mouse model of PNPLA3(S453I) to determine how the
variant lowers HTGC. Since the region of PNPLA3 spanning residue 453 is not present in mice, we will replace
the mouse gene with a human mini-gene containing the S453I variant using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. These
mice will be used to determine how this missense variant results in lower hepatic TG levels.
 These studies, when taken together, hold the promise of revealing new pathways and processes that can be
therapeutically manipulated for the prevention and treatment of PNPLA3-related FLD."
10818623,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among men in the United States. While
early-stage prostate cancers often respond to hormonal therapy, a subset progresses to an incurable “castration-
resistant” state (CRPC), which is resistant to standard hormonal therapies. A defining molecular feature of CRPC
is the reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, indicating that the AR remains central to prostate cancer
pathogenesis across disease states. Therefore, novel means of ablating AR signaling can inspire new treatment
strategies for CRPC. Through a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified the protein arginine
methyltransferases 1 and 5 (PRMT1/PRMT5) as novel regulators of the AR pathway. Both PRMT1 and PRMT5
modulate diverse biological processes, including AR signaling, through post-translational modification of
substrate proteins on arginine residues. As small molecule inhibitors of PRMT1 and PRMT5 have recently
entered clinical development, this pathway can also be therapeutically modulated in patients.
This proposal tests the hypothesis that PRMTs may have a specific role in regulating AR-driven transcriptional
programs through direct effects on AR and/or its co-factors, and that combination therapy with PRMT inhibitors
and direct AR antagonists may be an effective therapeutic strategy in advanced prostate cancer. In Aim 1, we
will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which PRMT1 and PRMT5 regulate AR signaling. Specifically, we will
compare the effects that PRMT1 and PRMT5 have on AR signaling in various cellular contexts. We will then
investigate roles for these PRMTs in modulating AR signaling at various nodes, including histone modification,
chromatin architecture, modification of AR co-regulators, and modification of the AR itself. In Aim 2, we will
establish the therapeutic potential of combining PRMT1 and/or PRMT5 inhibitors with an AR antagonist in in
vitro and in vivo prostate cancer models. Since our preliminary data indicate that both PRMT1 and PRMT5
modulate AR signaling, we hypothesize that inhibiting both enzymes in combination with direct inhibition of AR
may be an effective strategy to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer and to delay the emergence of castration
resistance. Moreover, prior studies have shown that the combination of PRMT1 and PRMT5 is synergistic and
well-tolerated in preclinical in vivo models. We will therefore test the activity of direct AR antagonists in
combination with PRMT1 and/or PRMT5 inhibitors in in vivo patient-derived xenograft models of hormone-
sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Finally, we will interrogate the relationship between PRMT1,
PRMT5, and AR expression in clinically-annotated prostate cancer tissue specimens and in large-scale prostate
cancer sequencing datasets.
These experiments will validate PRMT1 and PRMT5 as therapeutic targets in prostate cancer and will lend
insight into the mechanisms by which AR signaling is regulated. Overall, this work advances a mechanism-driven
therapeutic hypothesis with the potential to improve outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer."

Black, Hispanic, and rural Americans are twice as likely to die from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). These health
disparities have been fueled by inadequate access to essential resources throughout the pandemic. Such inequities are not
unique to Covid-19. Over the past century, emerging infectious diseases have significantly perpetuated health disparities
in underserved communities. The interconnected pathways leading to these disparities, including heterogeneous disease
epidemiology, sociodemographic characteristics, and treatment access and uptake, remain understudied. Mobile health
clinics (MHC) are an effective and versatile tool for reducing health disparities through timely delivery of interventions to
medically underserved populations. However, the inability to effectively identify and prioritize high-risk communities has
posed daunting challenges for MHC decision makers and has led to suboptimal allocation strategies. To help improve the
efficiency of these field-level interventions and reduce health disparities during Covid-19 and future pandemics, our
proposal seeks to develop a modeling toolkit to improve infectious disease surveillance and prediction in underserved
populations and prioritize the delivery of essential resources to high-risk communities in real time. Our innovative,
multilevel modeling framework will utilize statistical models, machine learning, compartment-based and agent-based
models to reduce health disparities through 1) establishing a real-time data system feed for infectious disease surveillance
and estimation of disease epidemiology in underserved communities 2) identifying at-risk populations for allocation of
essential resources, 3) evaluating the complex interplay between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, infectious
disease epidemiology, modifiable health barriers, and intervention uptake in order to improve emergency planning during
the Covid-19 pandemic and future health emergencies, and 4) establishing a modeling toolkit to inform delivery of
essential resources to underserved communities in real-time. This will be accomplished through real-time integration of
infectious disease outcome data, demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics, vaccine hesitancy surveys,
community-level contextual factors, and data on structural barriers to health care for estimation of key input parameters in
the dynamic simulation modeling framework. The framework we propose will be generalizable to other infectious
diseases, where model inputs will be disease and location dependent for swift translation to other public health problems.
To demonstrate the utility of our toolkit, our modeling framework will focus on delivery of Covid-19 mobile vaccination
clinics to underserved populations in South Carolina (SC). Our proposal will improve pandemic planning by developing
the modeling infrastructure for disease surveillance and understanding of infectious disease epidemiology in underserved
communities, ultimately improving timely delivery of essential resources to those of greatest need. Covid-19 has claimed
nearly 1 million American lives and has hospitalized over 4 million individuals through February 2022. Utilization of this
toolkit by public health decision makers can prevent thousands of future Covid-19 deaths. Through adaptation of input
data sources, our modeling framework is easily translatable to other infectious diseases and geographic regions and has
potential to save many more lives in future pandemics."

Nearly one-third of deceased donor livers are unused for transplant or other purposes. Many of these organs
would be valuable for therapeutic and research applications if preservation times could be extended.
Cryopreservation at ultralow temperatures (< -140°C) can enable indefinite organ storage. Previous attempts at
organ cryopreservation have failed due to cellular and structural disruption caused by ice crystal formation. One
promising approach that overcomes the limitations of conventional strategies is vitrification – that is, cooling
organs so quickly that the water within the organ cannot undergo the phase transition from liquid to solid ice.
With the help of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), the organ enters a stable glass-like state wherein the viable
storage time is theoretically unlimited. The critical challenge, however, is rewarming without ice formation or
cracking. If rewarming is too slow, ice crystals form; if rewarming is not uniform, thermal stress causes cracking.
Hence, speed and uniformity of warming are essential. We have developed a novel rewarming approach
termed “nanowarming” that achieves both objectives. Iron oxide nanoparticles are perfused throughout the
vasculature of the organ along with CPA solutions. The organ can then be vitrified by cooling (an existing
technology) and rewarmed as needed by placing it in a radiofrequency coil that induces heating in the
nanoparticles and, therefore, from within the organ. In preliminary studies, for the first time we have shown that
we can vitrify and nanowarm human sized (i.e. porcine) and rat livers, thereby avoiding ice formation or cracking
and preserving viability and organ-level function. Following on this physical success, we propose here the first
study to assess both transplantation and biological viability/function success of these nanowarmed organs. Our
central hypothesis is that cryopreservation by vitrification and nanowarming will enable functional long-term
whole human liver banking for transplant, therapeutic and biomedical research purposes. While our long-term
goal is to develop a method for cryopreserving human livers for transplant, our goals for this project are to refine
whole-liver preservation technology to 1) improve in vitro and in vivo functionality of preserved rat livers during
normothermic perfusion and in transplant models, 2) determine the mechanisms of cellular stress, injury, and
death resulting from liver cryopreservation and strategies for injury mitigation, and 3) provide further investigation
of large animal (porcine) and human liver cryopreservation and rewarming. If successful, this approach could
revolutionize how these precious resources are allocated and utilized for patient and societal benefit."
10789981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research program aims to develop innovative computational tools for the analysis and
integration of data from emerging spatially-resolved genomic technologies, which have the potential to uncover
the role of interactions with the environment in normal development and disease. Existing analytical tools for
analyzing spatial omics data are limited in their interpretability and are not capable of integrating multi-modal
data.
Leveraging our extensive experience in computational modeling of single-cell data as another
high-dimensional genomic data type, we will design machine learning frameworks in the form of probabilistic
and deep generative models to tackle the analytical challenges of spatially-resolved genomic data and
importantly integrate multiple data modalities. This framework will enable the identification of neighborhood
patterns defined as regions with a unique composition of cell states, from the integration of spatial profiling of
mRNAs, proteins, and histological imaging (Aim 1). We will build on a foundation of modeling gene regulatory
networks to develop the first computational tool for inferring spatially-varying regulation from the integration of
spatial ATAC-seq and RNA-seq (Aim 2). Additionally, we will develop a computational tool for inferring the
spatial distribution of cells with distinct copy number profiles, and their associated gene programs (Aim 3).
We highlight the versatility and generalizability of our computational methods by applying our techniques in
multiple biological systems with our collaborators. These applications will provide novel insights in
understanding the basis of spatial patterns in human and mouse embryonic development, brain organoid
models, as well as disease systems such as neuropsychiatric disorders, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Our
goal is to disseminate our computational toolbox as open-source software to the broader genomics community
to unlock novel insights about the spatial organization of cell types, their interactions, and mechanisms in
various biological systems."

An estimated 5.0 million children died before age 5 years globally in 2020. To improve child survival, the US
government and international community invest in the development, evaluation and implementation of age-
targeted, disease-specific life-saving childhood interventions, such as a malaria vaccine or azithromycin to
address leading causes of under-five mortality including malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and meningitis. Routine
and timely estimates of age-and cause-specific under-five mortality (ACSU5M) are critical for understanding
heterogeneity in causes of deaths within the under-five window and evaluating child survival policy and
program effectiveness. ACSU5M estimates mandate precision well beyond what’s required to effectively target
policies and programs in adults yet empirical data are scarce. Demographic and epidemiological evidence
amounts to the conclusion that child cause of death is not uniform in the 1-59-month period. National empirical
data at levels of specificity below 1-59 months are often not available in low resource settings with limited civil
registration systems. Such data and estimates bear considerable scientific value to inform the development
and impact evaluation of age-specific childhood interventions and their scale-up. Previous research has
suffered from four main drawbacks: (i) using custom-collected data to understand age dynamics in a single
cause; (ii) estimating ACSU5M only in broad age groups; (iii) ignoring uncertainty that arises from the empirical
measurements of ACSU5M, such as prevalence measurement errors from routine household surveys; and (iv)
failing to address cost effectiveness in data collection strategies. We leverage a team with extensive
experience in both cause-specific and under-five mortality measurement and estimation to propose a series of
Aims targeted at these drawbacks by specifically assessing and accounting for measurement errors to improve
ACSU5M estimation in low-income countries. Our proposal evaluates data collection strategies through
validation studies, focus group discussions and cluster randomized trials, and develops state-of-the-art
statistical methodology to improve both the inputs into and the methodology behind ACSU5M estimation. Our
statistical work builds on our ongoing NICHD R21HD095451 to develop a flexible Bayesian model which
incorporates multiple sources of uncertainty using partial registration data. Partnerships with Country wide
Mortality Surveillance for Action in Mozambique (COMSA-Mozambique) and the Matlab, Bangladesh Health
and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) provide both infrastructure to evaluate and innovate on data
collection strategies, high quality data for methodology development, and target end users for dissemination. If
successful, the proposed study will further improve understanding of measurement errors in ACSU5M
originated from major data collection strategies and significantly advance ACSU5M estimation to systematically
address data scarcity issue so as to inform decision making to better child survival in low-income countries."
10908263,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Computed tomography (CT) imaging for the body can result in thousands of images spanning many organs
and myriad possible diseases. With growing patient load as well as increasing resolution and complexity of
scans, the task of CT interpretation has become daunting. To improve radiologist performance, many artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms have been produced, but most are limited by their very narrow application to a
specific disease in a specific organ or have been trained on limited data due to the high cost and complexity of
manual annotation. As a result, there is an unmet need because existing AI solutions have not significantly
improved the workflow or performance of radiologists.
To meet these needs, we propose to develop a computer-aided diagnosis triage tool for CT of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) that would focus radiologists’ attention on regions with a high likelihood of
actionable disease while minimizing search efforts in regions of low likelihood.
Our hypothesis is that a triage tool will improve radiologist workflow while simultaneously maintaining or
improving performance. Our long-term goal is to create a clinical decision support system that will address
bottlenecks of radiologist workflow and performance. As key steps toward demonstrating feasibility for that
goal, we propose the following three specific aims:
1. Create framework for the assembly, deidentification, annotation, and sharing of over a million chest,
 abdomen, pelvis (CAP) CT cases from two major health systems.
2. Develop a triage system trained using multi-site CT datasets through collaborative/federated learning.
3. Pilot use of the triage system at multiple sites to allow radiologists to perform efficiently and equivalently for
 clinical tasks of assessing actionable disease in CAP CT.
Key innovations will include the use of weak supervision to label a massive number of cases from two health
systems. Labeling will be based on rule-based expert systems as well as natural language processing. Image
classification will be based on deep learning models capable of processing an entire 3D CT volume and trained
with federated learning to leverage the rich heterogeneity of data from the two health systems.
The expected outcome of this project will be evidence to support a new clinical workflow for radiologist
interpretation, which is the foundation for all medical imaging. For this project, we will maximize impact by
addressing CAP CT because of the large patient load and complex anatomy/disease, and by producing one of
the largest medical imaging datasets that can be shared for future research including grand challenges. In
addition, by leveraging existing data in patient archives and radiology reports, our approach has the potential to
be applicable to other body sites or imaging modalities in the future."
10769852,"Overgeneralization is a cognitive impairment commonly associated with post-traumatic stress
disorder as well as mood and anxiety disorders. Over the past 10 years of this grant, we have
accumulated several lines of evidence indicating that the dentate gyrus (DG) contributes to a
range of negative valence related behaviors including fear overgeneralization, as well as to some
of the behavioral effects of antidepressant medications. Specifically, we and others have shown
that the dentate gyrus is critical for contextual fear discrimination learning, a form a
learning that has been proposed to be mediated by pattern separation, a computational
process by which similar experiences are transformed into discrete non-overlapping neural
representations. In the current proposal we aim at bringing together these behavioral and
physiological lines of research by showing that the DG is critical for pattern separation and that
deficits in pattern separation underlie the contextual discrimination deficits often observed in mood
and anxiety disorders. Based on our preliminary results we hypothesize that strategies aimed
at improving pattern separation in the DG will be beneficial for the treatment of mood and
anxiety disorders.
Unlike most other brain regions, the adult DG contains not only mature developmentally-born
neurons but also adult-born neurons generated via a process termed adult neurogenesis. We
and others have shown that both mature granule cells (mGCs) and young adult-born granule cells
(abGCs) are critical for contextual fear discrimination learning (CFD). In the proposed studies we
will image the activity of both abGCs as well as mGCs in the DG during a contextual fear
discrimination task by using calcium imaging and miniature microscopes (miniscopes).
This imaging will be done in baseline conditions (Aim 1), after optogenetic manipulation of abGCs
to modulate DG activity (Aim 2), and after early life stress and adult manipulations of DG activity
(Aim 3)."
10754947,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Valves are present within hearts, veins and lymphatic vessels to regulate the flow of blood and lymph. Defects
in the development or functioning of valves could lead to diseases such as lymphedema and degenerative heart
valve disease. Venous and lymphatic (vascular) valves are composed of two layers of endothelial cells with a
thin layer of collagen-rich extra cellular matrix (ECM). Few if any interstitial cells are observed within vascular
valves. In contrast, cardiac valves are made of two major cell types: numerous ECM producing valvular interstitial
cells (VICs), which are surrounded by a single layer of valvular endothelial cells (VECs). Despite significant
differences in their structure and the mechanical force that they experience, cardiac and vascular valves share
interesting similarities. The homeobox transcription factor PROX1 is necessary for the development of vascular
valves. PROX1 is also expressed in a subset of VECs on the downstream side of heart valves. We have now
determined that the deletion of PROX1 from VECs results in the accumulation of proteoglycans and the
consequent thickening of heart valves. Thus, PROX1 in VECs regulates the development and functioning of
VICs through yet unknown mechanisms.
Building on our preliminary data we will test our Central Hypothesis that a previously unknown
PROX1àFOXC2àPDGF-B signaling pathway from downstream VECs regulates VIC identity and, in turn, the
ECM composition of valves.
Abnormally high synthesis of proteoglycans is observed in several valve disorders. Valve defects are
observed in ~8% in individuals >65 years old and ~13% in those who are >75. Pharmacological approaches to
treat these valve defects do not exist. Hence, the outcomes of our proposed research are expected to be
significant because they will substantially advance our insight into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
VEC-VIC crosstalk during cardiac valve development and shed light on potential therapeutic strategies."

Dr. Aaron Kornblith, a general and pediatric emergency physician at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) is establishing himself as a future investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of novel diagnostics
in injured children. This award will enable him to accomplish the following goals: (1) become an expert at patient-
oriented clinical research in pediatric abdominal trauma; (2) develop novel machine learning models for a
bedside ultrasound application; (3) implement advanced computational methods to develop, validate, and test
clinical decision rules incorporating bedside ultrasound; and (4) develop an independent clinical research career.
To achieve these goals, Dr. Kornblith has assembled an expert mentoring team: primary mentor Dr. Jeffrey
Fineman, Chief of Pediatric Critical Care at UCSF (conducts clinical investigations in children with critical illness
and is an expert in career development of early-stage investigators), co-mentors Dr. Atul Butte, (an expert in
healthcare and data science), Drs. James Holmes and Nathan Kuppermann (experts in the diagnostic evaluation
of pediatric trauma and clinical decision rules), scientific advisor Dr. John Mongan, (expert in developing,
validating, and implementing machine learning for imaging tasks), and statistical advisor Dr. Bin Yu (an expert
in statistical theory including accurate, reliable, and interpretable computational methods, and implicit bias).
Hemorrhage from blunt intraabdominal injury is a leading cause of death in children. Identifying abdominal
hemorrhage early is essential to minimizing morbidity and mortality from delayed or missed diagnoses. The
reference standard test, abdominal computed tomography (CT), has drawbacks including risk of radiation-
induced malignancy. For 25 years, CT use in children has increased dramatically without proportional
improvements in outcomes. Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) is a bedside ultrasound
method to evaluate children for abdominal hemorrhage. FAST may help clinicians balance the risk of missed
intraabdominal injury with unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation from CT. Dr. Kornblith’s research will focus
on improving pediatric FAST’s accuracy and reliability using machine learning models (Aim 1) and
developing/validating novel clinical decision rules incorporating FAST to identify children at very low risk for injury
who can forgo CT (Aim 2). Dr. Kornblith will use an existing dataset and computing infrastructure to develop and
validate a machine learning model using >2.1 million frames from 1,264 pediatric FAST studies to detect
hemorrhage as accurately as an expert (Aim 1), and two pre-existing datasets to develop and validate novel
clinical decision rules incorporating FAST and compare their performance to existing clinical decision rules (Aim
2). The proposed research and training plan will position Dr. Kornblith with cross-disciplinary skills to transition
to independence and submit a competitive R01 focused on refinement and validation of novel clinical decision
rules integrating advanced computational methods applied to FAST for children after blunt abdominal trauma."

Plasma H2S is reduced as a consequence of obesity in mice and humans. The vasoactive and cytoprotective actions of H2S are mutually dependent on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) production of NO. NO is a regulator of lipolysis, adipogenesis, angiogenesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics. We will test the hypothesis that H2S is a positive regulator of adipogenesis and angiogenesis. Specific Aim 1 will tests the importance of whole body H2S production by using the cystathionine-y-lyase (CSE) knockout mouse model. Using this model, we will determine the metabolic phenotype of male and female CSE-KO mice under obesogenic conditions (high fat diet) compared to a low fat diet. We will complete extensive metabolic phenotyping using stable isotope to assess dynamic glucose metabolism and adipogenesis. We will also use the metabolic cage system in the Pennington Metabolic Phenotyping core to determine alterations in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation between CSE KO and wild type mice. In aim 2 we will investigate the effect of obesity on adipose tissue microvascular function in CSE KO mice. Using a novel microdialysis approach we will perfustate a nitric oxide spin trap (MGD-Fe2+) with and without a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) to determine if loss of CSE alters lipolysis and blood flow. We will use a novel ex vivo vessel sprouting assay to determine CSE function in adipose tissue angiogenesis is NO-dependent. This proposal will provide novel data on the function of H2S in the adipose tissue by leveraging the resources available at Pennington Biomedical."

The ability to generate, store and analyze high throughput genomic data is critical for many aspects of modern 
biology, and especially for human genetics. The Clemson University Genomics and Bioinformatics Facility 
(CUGBF) provides small to moderate scale genome analysis and customized bioinformatics services. The 
Clemson University Center for Human Genetics Genome Sciences Laboratories (CUCHG-GSL) supports in- 
house high throughput, large scale genome analysis, including third generation single molecule long-read 
sequencing and single cell analyses, as well as custom bioinformatic and statistical analyses of genomic data. 
The COBRE in Human Genetics will expand the scope of genomics and bioinformatics at Clemson University 
and the State of South Carolina by combining and expanding the genomics, bioinformatics and computational 
infrastructure and personnel of the CUGBF and the CUCHG-GSL under the single umbrella of an enhanced 
CUGBF. The expanded CUGBF will span the spectrum of next generation sequencing platforms, provide 
custom bioinformatics and statistical analyses and advice on experimental design, and genomics and 
bioinformatics seminars and workshops. The enhanced CUGBF will thus provide the infrastructure, project 
guidance and supervision, and training to empower COBRE in Human Genetics Research and Pilot Project 
Leaders and their laboratory groups to fully deploy extant and emerging genomic and computational 
technologies in their research programs. These services will also be available for all Clemson University faculty 
and their research groups as well as faculty in sister institutions in South Carolina. In addition, the enhanced 
CUGBF will host monthly genomics and bioinformatics seminars and hands-on workshops to train students, 
postdoctoral fellows and faculty to become self-sufficient in obtaining and analyzing genomics data. The 
enhanced CUGBF thus fills three critical needs for the wide scale adoption of modern genomics and 
bioinformatics research in an Institutional Development Award state: (1) local availability of genomics and 
computational infrastructure; (2) provision of molecular biology and bioinformatics services to investigators new 
to such large scale analyses; and (3) training researchers to become self-sufficient in obtaining and analyzing 
genomics data."
10791784,"Diabetic foot ulcers that lead to amputations are a major health problem affecting ~20% of the 30 million diabetic
patients in the US. The current regimen has limited success, and the amputation rates remain high. Therefore,
understanding molecular mechanisms for compounds with translational potential is a crucial step toward making
a breakthrough in wound care protocols. Endothelial cells (ECs) are indispensable cellular components for
wound angiogenesis. However, EC functions are impaired in patients with diabetes. The coformulation of two
dietary compounds - Trans-resveratrol (tRES) and hesperetin (HESP) - improves glucose metabolic profile and
arterial function in overweight and obese subjects through inducing the gene expression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1),
an enzyme that detoxifies reactive metabolites during glycolysis and protects cells against glycation stress. Our
pilot data indicated that tRES+HESP improved wound healing in diabetic animals with an increase in GLO1
expression. However, its effects are likely far beyond inducing GLO1 expression because tRES+HESP treated
ECs produced many pro-angiogenic factors, including angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) that plays an essential role in
angiogenesis. Therefore, it is critical to determine proteins that are regulated by tRES+HESP in angiogenesis
and tissue repair. The objective of this project is to fill the knowledge gap of the role of tRES+HESP in rescuing
the disrupted angiogenesis in diabetes, and our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies for diabetic
wound repair. We hypothesize that tRES+HESP augments angiogenesis and improves diabetic wound healing
through enhancing the expression of GLO1 and a potent pro-angiogenic factor, ANGPT1, and through novel
changes in additional proteins in pathways critical to diabetic wound repair. Aim 1: Identification of molecular
pathways and protein changes induced by tRES+HESP in human dermal microvascular ECs in vitro. Sub-aim
1: Determine to what extent tRES+HESP can rescue diabetic endothelial cell function in vitro. Sub-aim 2:
Determine how vital ANGPT1 is in tRES+HESP-induced angiogenesis in vitro. Sub-aim 3: Discover new proteins
and pathways responsible for the benefit of tRES+HESP treatment in endothelial cell function in vitro using state-
of-the-art proteomics. Aim 2: Determine the therapeutic potential of tRES+HESP and its underlying molecular
mechanisms in chronic diabetic wounds in vivo. Sub-aim 1: Determine the efficacy of tRES+HESP on wound
healing in a newly developed diabetic chronic wound model in db/db mice. Sub-aim 2: Determine the role of
ANGPT1 in the tRES+HESP-induced improvement in wound healing in vivo. Sub-aim 3: Discover new proteins
and pathways responsible for the benefit of tRES+HESP treatment in diabetic wound repair in vivo using state-
of-the-art proteomics. The outcome of the proposed research will determine the efficacy of topical application
of this formula, tRES+HESP, in diabetic wound healing, and will unveil underlying molecular mechanisms for its
beneficial effect. Since tRES+HESP has not been approved by the FDA to treat diabetic wound healing yet,
these results may facilitate the FDA approval of this coformulation in diabetic wound treatment."
10796974,"In all organ systems, timely and non-inflammatory clearance of senescent, damaged and dead cells is a
crucial checkpoint at the crossroads of tissue homeostasis and inflammation. Through a specialized form of
phagocytosis, termed efferocytosis, the tissue-resident phagocytes recognize, engulf and digest cell corpses
without the inflammatory and self-destructive activation of the immune system. Efferocytosis of virally infected cell
corpses is also a prerequisite to antigen processing and presentation that lies at the heart of anti-viral
immunosurveillance. The mechanisms through which the engulfed corpses are digested in the efferophagosome
are highly dependent on Ca2+-signaling but underlying ion channel mechanisms have not been studied. Our
preliminary data indicates that the ion channel TRPM7 plays a crucial role in the maturation of the efferophagosome
and its ultimate fusion with the lysosomes. Pursuing these tantalizing leads has now laid a strong scientific
foundation to hypothesize that: Efferophagosome maturation is controlled by the fusion of M7Vs to the
efferophagosome and through TRPM7 channel activity in the efferophagosome membrane. In Aim 1, to establish
the physiological significance, we will interrogate TRPM7 function across three main forms of efferocytosis,
including its role in coordinating inflammatory signals. In Aim 2, we distill key insights about the nature and function
of TRPM7-containing vesicles in efferophagosome maturation. In Aim 3, we develop a mechanistic picture of how
TRPM7 is activated and how this activity controls efferophagosome maturation. This research is conceptually
innovative because it unravels new molecular machinery involving TRPM7 in the understudied process of
efferophagosome maturation. Our research is also the first thrust toward a complete biochemical characterization
of TRPM7-containing vesicles (M7Vs) and their cell biological function. Technical innovations include novel
transgenic/gene-edited mouse lines, and membrane fusion assays designed specifically to interrogate M7V-efferophagosome fusion. Deconstructing the efferophagosome in terms of its maturation stages, molecular
architecture, and biophysical/biochemical activities may advance TRPM7 as a drug target to modify tissue
regeneration and anti-viral immunity."
10783026,"Understanding neuronal subtype-specific function of NAc in cocaine addiction
Abstract
 Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking
and use despite harmful consequences. It is an urgent social and health problem contributing to more
than 90,000 deaths and incurs a yearly cost of over $700 billion in the United States (see NIDA website).
It is believed that long-term maladaptive changes in the brain reward system play a central role in the
development of addictive disorders. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.
 The long-lasting effect of drugs on animal behavior and the risk of relapse in human addicts
indicate that some stable changes in the brain reward system induced by drugs of abuse mediate these
long-term behavioral adaptions. Accumulating evidence suggests that drug-induced molecular, cellular
and circuitry changes, especially those in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), play important roles in drug
addiction. However, due to the cellular heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, the cell type-specific
mechanism of addition is unknown.
 To overcome the cell heterogeneity issue and to advance our understanding of the cell subtype-
specific mechanisms of drug addiction, we propose to identify the neuronal subtypes in NAc involved
in addiction by comprehensively analyzing the transcriptional profiles of this brain region in a neuron
subtype-specific manner, using a clinically relevant intravenous cocaine self-administration (IVSA)
mouse model. Furthermore, cell type-specific profiling/manipulation approaches will be used to
understand the function and mechanism of specific neuron subtypes during addictive process. To
achieve this goal, we have the following specific aims:
1) Profile cell type-specific transcriptome of different neuron subtypes of NAc using a mouse model of
 cocaine IVSA;
2) The function and circuitry mechanisms of Tac2+ D1 MSN subtype in cocaine addiction;
3) Understand the epigenetic mechanism of the neuron subtype-specific functions in cocaine
addiction.
 Completion of the proposed study will not only advance our understanding on how different NAc
neuron subtypes contribute to drug addiction, but also reveal novel therapeutic targets for treating this
disorder."
10760295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We evaluate the influence of patient race/ethnicity and surgeon bias on communication and outcomes for
children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB). OSDB occurs in up to 20% of children and
impacts physical health, behavior, and learning. The primary treatment is tonsillectomy, with or without
adenoidectomy, which is the most common major surgical procedure performed in U.S. children. Children
who are Black or Hispanic have increased prevalence of OSDB, poorer sleep outcomes, and more
complications of surgery. Clinician implicit bias may be an important contributor to these disparities, as
evolving evidence shows that bias negatively impacts patient relationships, care delivery, and outcomes for
vulnerable populations. We have previously shown that surgeons inconsistently offer alternatives to surgery
and rarely elicit family preferences when speaking to parents, and that they are less likely to explore emotions
of minority families. These findings, coupled with known disparities in OSDB clinical outcomes, highlight the
critical problem that surgeon implicit attitudes toward minority families may influence communication,
decision-making, and ultimately outcomes for children with OSDB. Our long-term goal is to improve equity,
healthcare quality, and outcomes for children with OSDB. The overall objective of this application is to develop
a comprehensive profile of the complex social and interpersonal dynamics that may affect treatment decisions
and cause disparate patient outcomes for minority children. To do so, we will establish across three institutions
a repository of audio-recorded encounters between a large, diverse cohort of surgical clinicians and parents
of children undergoing OSDB consultations. We will first evaluate the influence of clinician implicit bias and
patient race/ethnicity on surgeon parent-communication and quality and equity of OSDB care. We will
quantitatively code communication behaviors (patient-centeredness, emotional responsiveness, and shared
decision-making) of parents and clinicians occurring during child OSDB consultations and test for differences
between high and low implicit bias clinicians, by patient race and ethnicity. We will also examine differences
in parent trust in clinician, decision regret, and clinical outcomes, and assess whether communication
behaviors mediate observed disparities in these patients and parent reported OSDB outcomes. We will then
interview a subset of Black, Hispanic, and White parents and high and low bias clinicians to understand the
potential influence of race, ethnicity, and bias on communication, and learn patient-centered solutions to
improve communication. Using a stimulated recall qualitative approach, participants listen to audiotapes of
their own clinical encounters and directly comment on salient elements of communication that occurred.
Findings from this research will directly inform development of interventions to mitigate surgeon bias, promote
culturally competent communication, and improve outcomes for children with OSDB."
10786042,"Frailty is a significant problem for older (age 65+) cancer survivors, particularly Black survivors. Older cancer
survivors are at 46% greater risk of being physically frail compared to those without a history of cancer. Older
Black cancer survivors are at 18% greater risk of being frail compared to older white survivors. No standard
treatments for physical frailty in older cancer survivors exist. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and related
immune markers are associated with physical frailty in older cancer survivors. Black individuals have elevated
TNF-α and related immune markers due to the psychosocial stressors tied to their racially minoritized status.
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a potent anti-inflammatory nutraceutical that reduces TNF-α and related
immune markers and risk of functional decline. EGCG is a promising intervention to reduce physical frailty in
older cancer survivors. This proposal builds upon my previous work demonstrating a relationship between cancer
treatments, physical frailty, DNAmage, and TNF-α and related immune markers. My work also shows that an
EGCG intervention (capsules with 800mg EGCG + 250mg VitC) is safe and feasible in older cancer survivors.
This proposal presents a five-year complimentary research and career development plan. For this proposal I will
conduct a Phase II, multicenter, 2-arm placebo controlled randomized clinical trial in 118 (58 Black) older cancer
survivors (aged 65+), who have completed cancer treatment (≤12 months) and are at least pre-frail (Fried Frailty

preliminary efficacy of the EGCG intervention on TNF-α and related immune markers; 3) To explore if baseline

frailty; and 4) To explore the efficacy of the EGCG intervention on physical frailty and TNF-α and related immune
markers in older Black vs. white cancer survivors. I will also complete the following new training goals: 1) To
develop expertise to design, conduct, analyze and lead multicenter randomized clinical trials focused on
nutraceuticals as interventions for frailty in older cancer survivors; 2) To obtain training in epigenetics as a
biomarker of frailty; 3) To gain expertise in strategies to improve the diversity of clinical trial participants, with an

This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a statistician committed to improving the
design and analysis of tropical infectious disease cluster-randomized trials (CRTs). Worldwide, hundreds of
CRTs are carried out annually to evaluate the effect of new interventions against infectious diseases,
especially in tropical developing countries experiencing dengue, Ebola, malaria, and other infectious disease
outbreaks. The scientific rigor of these CRTs relies on valid statistical analysis methods that adequately
address the complexity in the CRT designs. However, the emergence of CRTs with complex and novel designs
has outpaced the development of causal inference methods for data analysis. This gap represents a key
barrier to providing valid sample size calculation, efficient estimation, and correct interpretation of the
intervention effect estimates. The overarching goal of this research is to surmount this barrier by developing
valid, robust, and efficient statistical methods. Specifically, the applicant will address the statistical challenges
of three CRT designs: (1) covariate-adaptive randomization, which has been extensively used for reducing
baseline imbalance, (2) the test-negative design, which has been increasingly popular in recent years for
achieving cost-efficiency, and (3) the multi-arm stepped-wedge design, which has the potential to improve
flexibility and efficiency for future CRTs. In the K99 phase, the applicant will extend the empirical process
theory to handle covariate-adaptive randomization in CRTs and provide both theoretical and computation
evaluations of current statistical models. During the first year of the R00 phase, the applicant will focus on test-
negative designs in CRTs and eliminate the bias from differential healthcare-seeking behavior by
characterizing the underlying causal graph and performing inference on self-nondiagnosable symptoms.
Finally, the applicant will develop an optimal design that can simultaneously handle treatment roll-out, multiple
interventions, and various outcome types. The applicant will accomplish the research aims under the
mentorship of established researchers in infectious disease, statistics, and biostatistics to assure his transition
to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading infectious disease
biostatistician. At the University of Pennsylvania, the applicant enjoys rich internal resources of courses,
seminars, computational equipment, collaborations, and intellectual interactions with prestigious researchers;
furthermore, the applicant has access to external training opportunities including summer institutes, national
conferences, and hands-on learning in trial conduct in Kenya. These training activities will propel the research
career of the application, thereby supporting his achieving academic independence and ultimately leading a
research team to advance the research of infectious diseases."

Disordered glucose homeostasis and glucose instability are common in older adults. Age is one of the most
important risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes and there is growing evidence that glycemic
variability contributes to risk of complications, independent of average glucose or HbA1c. In older adults with
diabetes, there is controversy regarding appropriate treatment targets and hypoglycemia is a major concern.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is the recommended approach to the assessment of hypoglycemia and
glycemic variability, but this technology has rarely been used in older adults. Very old adults (age 80 years or
older) are a particularly vulnerable population but have rarely been included in prior studies. Our overarching
objective is to characterize glucose patterns in older adults (>80 years) using state-of-the-art CGM technology.
We will characterize “normal” glucose patterns and evaluate the frequency of unrecognized glycemic
excursions in adults with and without diabetes (including persons with prediabetes). We will relate glucose
patterns including glucose excursions (hypo- and hyperglycemia) to current health status and clinical outcomes
during 4 years of follow-up. These results will provide information on the clinical relevance of glucose patterns
in an older adult population and generate evidence-based guidance regarding the use and interpretation of
CGM in this population."

response. Most of the recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have focused on generating potent tumor
specific T cells and overcoming tumor-induced T cell inhibition and tolerance. However, a rate-limiting step to
establishing efficacious cellular therapy for the treatment of malignancies is the lack of T cell homing to the
tumor site. To circumvent this obstacle, we investigated fucosylation as a mechanism to enhance cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) homing. Fucosylation, a process mediated by fucosyltransferases, adds fucose sugar
groups to cell surface glycoproteins, increasing their affinity to selectins on tumor cells, endothelial cells, and
within inflamed tissues. Our preclinical work using ex vivo fucosylation of tumor-specific polyclonally-expanded
CTL and regulatory T cells (Treg) showed enhanced CTL homing to bone marrow and tumor sites, and Treg
homing to graft-versus-host disease involved tissues, respectively. Furthermore, fucosylation of cord blood
(CB) products enhanced the homing and engraftment of CB stem cells to marrow in patients with hematologic
malignancies undergoing CB transplants. What remains unknown is whether fucosylation of CAR T cells will
enhance their homing into tumor tissue. Without this knowledge, the effectiveness of CAR T cells as an
immunotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer will likely remain limited.
 Our long-term objective is to develop effective cellular immunotherapy for cancer. In this proposal, we
will investigate the role of fucosylation in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), using a fucosylated CAR
T cell approach (i.e. fucosylated 8F4-CAR T cells) which targets an antigen that our group discovered, PR1.
We hypothesize that immunotherapy using fucosylated 8F4-CAR T cells will inhibit AML in vivo, with minimal
off-target toxicity. In our first aim, we will study the effects of ex vivo fucosylation on 8F4-CAR T cell efficacy
and safety, and in the second aim, we will determine whether engineering 8F4-CAR T cells to endogenously
express fucosyltransferase VII will enhance their anti-tumor activities. We will employ an AML xenograft
mouse model in both aims, and will elucidate the mechanisms by which fucosylation augments T cell activity.
Our proposed research is significant, in that fucosylation is expected to enhance not only T cell homing and
entry into tumor sites, but also their cytolytic machinery, thereby improving their efficacy. Furthermore, since
the engineering of an adequate dose of tumor-specific effector cells is at times a limiting step to adoptive
cellular therapy, fucosylation will allow for the engineering and infusion of fewer tumor-targeting T cells, as
more fucosylated T cells are expected to home favorably to the malignant milieu. Underscored by the fact that
stem cell fucosylation has already demonstrated safety and efficacy clinically, we believe our innovative
approach may greatly facilitate the effectiveness of T cell therapy in AML as well as other malignant diseases,
and could transform our current approach to cellular immunotherapy."

Historically, the majority of relevant research has only interrogated classical pathways in bladder cancer cells
and has had little success in developing clinical drugs against bladder cancer (BC). Immunotherapy, including
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, has recently been proven effective in treating a number of tumor lineages, but the majority
of BC cases are regarded as resistant or immune-quiescent tumors and are unresponsive to single checkpoint
treatments. These challenges demand definition of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immuno-
suppression that develops during BC progression. We demonstrated that tumor-resident Schwann cells (referred
as TASc) play important roles in promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment. TAScs express one
lncRNA that modulates RAF1-mediated phosphorylation of TDO2 (Tryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenase), thereby
facilitating the enzymatic activities of TDO2 and catalysis of Tryptophan to Kynurenine. The released Kynurenine
in tumor microenvironment further facilitates the expansion of MDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) and
quiescence of effector T cells. Therefore, considering TAScs and lncRNAs as therapeutic targets may potentially
sensitize BC to immunotherapy.
The long-term goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms and functional importance of
lncRNAs in BC so that improved strategies can be developed to reduce BC immune resistance. Our central
hypothesis is that PVT1 facilitates phosphorylation of TDO2 in TAScs to promote BC immunoresistance, which
could be attenuated in vivo using a targeted therapy. We will address our hypothesis from following aspects. 1)
We will demonstrate the prognostic value of TAScs in BC and determine the functional importance of TASc
expressing lncRNA in BC tumorigenesis (Aim 1). We will determine the underlying molecular mechanisms of
lncRNA in regulating the enzymatic activities of TDO2 and the IL-6 induced, RAF1-mediated phosphorylation of
TDO2 (Aim 2). 3) We will ascertain the functional importance of TAScs using small molecule inhibitor and small
molecule inhibitor-conjugated anti-sense oligonucleotides, anti-IL-6 neutralization antibody, or kynurenine
aminotransferase inhibitor in combination with immunotherapy in inhibiting BC immune resistance and
metastasis (Aim 3).
Emerging evidence of the oncogenic involvement of lncRNAs, as well as their implicated roles in mediating
immunosuppression, warrants further characterization of TASc-specific lncRNAs and future applications that
hinge on their activity. Our goal is to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of BC immune resistance from
lncRNA and metabolite points of view. Thus, a strategy that combines immune checkpoint inhibitors and lncRNA-
based therapeutic strategies has the potential to significantly advance BC treatment. In the long run, these
research findings will benefit the cancer community by introducing the robust clinical effects of targeting TAScs
and TASc-expressing lncRNAs as promising therapeutic targets."
