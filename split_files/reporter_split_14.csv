 Increased rates of depression and suicidality among LGBTQ people of color (LGBTQ-POC) is a
critically important public health concern. LGBTQ-POC experience the cumulative stress of systemic in-
equality and discrimination, including lower socioeconomic status, higher exposure to neighborhood crime, trau-
matic childhood experiences, and differential access to mental health care and resources. Although critical for
early prevention and clinical practice, essential gaps remain to understand depression and suicide-related behav-
iors among LGBTQ-POC. Reduced samples in individual studies and methodological limitations have restricted
our ability to understand depression and suicidality from a developmental perspective. I propose using a se-
quential cohort design and Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) to examine longitudinal trajectories of
depression and suicidality among LGBTQ-POC adolescents. IDA combines individual-level data from
multiple independent studies into a single dataset. IDA provides increased statistical power, increased frequency
of low base-rate behaviors, and the ability to study an expanded sample of underrepresented subgroups. Further,
I will explore overlapping age cohorts across numerous longitudinal studies using a sequential co-
hort design, which will provide a much broader understanding of development. The proposed study
includes adolescents in 18 randomized prevention trials who identified as LGBTQ-POC (N = 2,029). Researchers
surveyed participants at varying intervals from 1 to 15.25 years. At baseline, youth enrolled in the studies were 7 to
19 years of age (M = 12.7). Given the length of the trials, the proposed study will examine a sizable developmental
period from 7 up to 34 years. In Aim 1, I will use multilevel growth mixture modeling (MGMM) to examine longi-
tudinal trajectories of depression and suicide-related behaviors among LGBTQ-POC. In Aim 2, I will identify early
depression symptoms associated with longitudinal trajectories of suicide ideation and behaviors. Lastly, Aim 3
will examine the impact of early intrapersonal and interpersonal protective factors on longitudinal trajectories of
depression and suicidality. These aims closely align with strategic Goals 2 and 3 of NIMH to “examine mental
illness trajectories throughout the lifespan” and “highlight efforts to improve preventive and therapeutic inter-
ventions.” Further, the aims of this fellowship can support efforts to remediate systemic inequalities in mental
healthcare that disproportionately impact LGBTQ-POC. These insights could offer new evidence and actionable
tools to supplement existing interventions and target prevention efforts to critical periods of development and
groups of high need capitalizing on the strengths and protective factors of LGBTQ-POC. Lastly, this fellowship
will allow me to build a strong background in developmental science, mental health prevention, and quantitative
methodology with a focus on the health and well-being of LGBTQ-POC adolescents."

According to the World Health Organization, there are 1.7 billion cases of gastroenteritis every
year and approximately 1.5 million children deaths. Diarrheal disease is the second leading
cause of death in children under five years of age, mostly in the developing world. A wide-range
of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens can cause disease, with co-infections being common
in low income countries with high disease burden. Clinical determination of therapy in resource-
limited healthcare settings is frequently performed without etiological knowledge. As a result,
antibiotics are overprescribed and poorly targeted, and infections caused by pathogens with
high mortality rates may not be given adequate quality of care. Diagnostic testing for these
pathogens is inconsistent because detection of these common pathogens traditionally requires
transporting patients or patient samples, possibly over long distances, to a limited number of
diagnostic laboratories, and then performing multiple tests across microbiology, virology, and
molecular laboratories. Results may not be available for several days during which patients’
conditions may deteriorate without appropriate treatment. The rapid identification of pathogens
that cause infectious diarrheal disease at the point-of-care may save lives and improve health
outcomes by enabling prompt and appropriate treatment. Potential users in the developing
world could include tertiary clinics in rural areas or urban low-income populations with low health
care utilization and national public health field officers who investigate outbreaks. The goal of
our project is to determine the feasibility of developing an innovative paper strip test that can
integrate the steps of low cost, simple stool sample preparation and concentration method using
hollow silica microspheres for total nucleic acid capture with multiplexed nucleic acid
amplification and detection on a paper strip device. We will test 600 stool samples from patients
enrolled in an ongoing study of GI disease in low-income neighborhoods of Bangladesh where
the prevalence of infection by pathogens like Cholera, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter is
high. Success in this project can have broad impact in the development of other simple, point-
of-care differential detection tests for pathogens causing other diseases in other sample types."

Developmental language impairments are common in the general population, affecting approximately 1 in 10
children. Despite this prevalence, little is known about the etiology of language difficulties observed in conditions
such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Earlier therapeutic interventions for language impairments have
consistently been associated with better language and social outcomes, making it important to develop a better
understanding of the neural apparatus supporting successful language acquisition during the first year of life.
This project will improve our understanding of language development by longitudinally examining how neural
language processing and language network connectivity before an infant’s first birthday relate to later trajectories
of receptive and expressive language skills.
This proposal will leverage data from two ongoing NIH-funded longitudinal studies to examine the neural
processing of native vs. non-native language (Aim 1), functional connectivity within language networks (Aim 2),
and the structure of white matter tracts supporting cross-talk between language hubs (Aim 3). Language delays
have been associated with aberrant language-related neural activity and network connectivity in both typically
and atypically developing populations. Yet although newborns can already distinguish their native language from
other languages, no study has longitudinally examined the neural signatures of native language learning in early
infancy. Importantly, infant imaging studies have seldom employed adequate sample sizes and repeated
observations necessary for rigorous assessment of neurodevelopmental changes in brain connectivity within
language networks. Here, fMRI data collected with a stimulus-evoked language paradigm as part of the UCLA
ACE (NICHD P50 HD055784) will be used to chart neural responses associated with native language learning
during the first year of life in infants at high and low risk for ASD. Longitudinal resting-state fMRI and Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI) data from the Baby Connectome Project (1U01MH110274) will be used to thoroughly
characterize the early development of functional and structural connectivity, respectively, across brain regions
implicated in language processing. Finally, across all aims, differences in brain activity and connectivity during
infancy will be related to later language trajectories to identify early predictors of atypical language development.
The candidate, Lauren Wagner, will carry out these studies as a Neuroscience graduate student at UCLA under
the tutelage of Drs. Mirella Dapretto and Lucina Uddin who, together, have vast expertise in neurodevelopment,
pediatric imaging, language development, advanced neuroimaging methods, and ASD. UCLA’s infrastructure,
collaborative environment, and research training resources offer the candidate an ideal training environment in
which to carry out these aims. This F31 NRSA Fellowship will provide the applicant with comprehensive training
in MRI, statistical modeling, teaching, and dissemination of results that, altogether, will lay the foundation for a
successful academic research career focusing on neurodevelopmental disorders affecting language acquisition."
10896919,"Brain microvascular ischemic disease is a common cause of leukoencephalopathy, leading to cognitive
impairment, dementia, and stroke. CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical
infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is the most frequent mendelian cause of cerebral small vessel
disease. Over two decades ago, disease-causing CADASIL mutations were identified in the receptor
NOTCH3. These mutations result in progressive degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells in
arterioles. While systemic in nature, the clinical deficits associated with CADASIL manifest primarily in
the brain as a vascular disease, leading to multifocal ischemia with progressive cognitive decline. Despite
its devastating impact on patients, our knowledge of the disease is limited, restricting targeted
therapeutic strategies. A major impediment to progress has been the wide variability in disease
manifestation and a lack of agreement as to whether CADASIL results from a gain or loss of function in
NOTCH3 signaling.
Through a collaborative effort with the NIH Clinical Center, we have made significant strides towards
defining a broader range of clinical read-outs to improve diagnosis and prognosis of CADASIL. We also
gained novel information on molecular changes associated with specific disease-causing mutations
which, at least partially, bring clarity into the broad phenotypic variation. In fact, our findings indicate that
some mutations in NOTCH3 result in suppression of the pathway, while others lead to hyperactivation of
Notch signaling. The objective of this U01 application is to further expand the information related to
clinical presentation, advance the characterization of disease-causing mutations and determine the chief
molecular alterations resulting from these mutations. Furthermore, we will validate animal models to
explore potential avenues for treatment. While a clinical trial is the eventual long-term goal of this
research, a comprehensive understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships with the support of our
colleagues at the NIH Clinical Center is the necessary first step towards this goal. Thus, here our
objective is to test the hypothesis that CADASIL is a broad pleotropic disease caused by both loss and
gain of function mutations in NOTCH3 which mechanistically explain the wide clinical outcomes
associated with vascular degeneration. To test this hypothesis, we present three specific aims: (1) To
develop a robust, multi-organ, longitudinal evaluation of disease progression in a large number of
patients and establish genotype-phenotype relationships; (2) To fully characterize the molecular outcome
of CADASIL mutations as gain or loss of function and associate them with specific molecular read-outs
(3) To explore recently generated animal models representative of both genotype spectra and validate
their utility as potential platforms for therapeutic exploration."

 Approximately 50% of the 3.4 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) in the U.S. have cognitive problems with
memory deficits reported most commonly. Memory deficits negatively contribute to the personal and
professional outcomes of PWE including quality of life. While cognitive rehabilitation programs have been
utilized to help improve memory function in epilepsy, their efficacy remains unclear. Recently, memory
improvements with formal exercise training have been shown in randomized controlled trials in healthy
individuals, and in our pilot study in PWE who participated in supervised combined endurance and resistance
training. Despite evidence of memory and other cognitive benefits derived from physical exercise, clinical trials
of exercise as a rehabilitative strategy for memory improvement in PWE have not been conducted to date.
Further, we lack understanding of the brain changes that occur with exercise and their role in improving
memory function as well as the longitudinal effects of exercise on memory and brain changes. Improving our
understanding and ameliorating the negative impact of epilepsy, seizures, and its treatment are recognized by
the epilepsy, medical and scientific community as an important focus of research. Thus, exercise training is a
promising rehabilitative strategy for mitigating the memory deficits experienced in epilepsy.
 The primary objectives of this study are to determine in adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE)
the efficacy of a 6-week supervised and structured exercise program combining endurance and resistance
training for memory rehabilitation, investigate a putative mechanisms of action for exercise-related memory
benefits, and determine if the memory benefits and brain changes are retained 6 weeks after completing the
exercise intervention. Based on our pilot exercise data in adults with epilepsy, we hypothesize that exercise will
significantly improve verbal memory function in the exercise group compared to the no-intervention control
group. We also hypothesize that the verbal memory improvements are mediated by the changes in resting
state functional connectivity of the hippocampus, a brain region that plays a vital role in memory function. We
propose a mediation model in which exercise-induced changes in the hippocampus functional connectivity is
mediating the beneficial effect of exercise on memory function in epilepsy, and we will utilize the causal-steps
approach in which 4 conditions of statistical significance must be met to determine if mediation is present.
Using a randomized delayed intervention study design, we will conduct a clinical trial of the 6-week supervised
exercise program combining endurance and resistance training in adults with IGE in order to test our
hypotheses. Completion of the proposed study will significantly impact the field in that it will lay the groundwork
for the use of exercise for memory rehabilitation in epilepsy, in which option for combatting memory impairment
are limited."

Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is an aggressive myeloid neoplasm hallmarked by bone
marrow dysplasia, cytopenias, peripheral monocytosis, and a propensity for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
(AML) transformation. Although uniformly fatal, CMML initially present in a clinically asymptomatic state
and is monitored, without treatment, for a period of weeks to months. In all patients, CMML invariably
progresses to either a more symptomatic version of disease or undergoes AML transformation. It is this
lethal transformation that is responsible for CMML's dismal prognosis and median survival of only 34
months. Importantly, the molecular determinants of progression are poorly understood. CMML disease
progression and AML transformation have been historically associated with changes in genetic
architecture termed “clonal evolution.” However, a large subset of patients harbor the same somatic
mutations and variant allele frequency at the time of progression to that at diagnosis. Our laboratory has
discovered a non-clonal evolutionary adaptation whereby leukemic hematopoietic stem cells differentiate
to inflammatory GMPs leading to increased fitness in the context of inflammation while maintaining the
same repertoire of somatic mutations. Further, this adaptation was associated with adverse outcomes in
a retrospective cohort of CMML patients. Last, preclinical inflammatory models of CMML were able to
recapitulate this evolutionary adaptation in our preliminary data. Therefore, we hypothesize that
inflammatory insults induce the differentiation of leukemic GMPs that are tightly associated with disease
progression. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: (1) Establish the first prospective
longitudinal cohort study in CMML. It is very difficult to capture all inflammatory insults via retrospective
clinical analysis. To address this, this aim will assemble the first multi-institution prospective longitudinal
cohort study of CMML specifically designed to determine whether inflammatory insults are associated with
disease progression. Second, we will utilize samples from this study to validate bulk gene expression
signatures and a flow-based assay to identify those CMML cases with and inflammatory GMP biased state.
Last, we will leverage retrospective cohorts of treated CMML to determine the impact of existing therapy on
this GMP biased state. (2) Determine whether the inflammatory GMP biased state is an evolutionary
adaptation that can be therapeutically exploited. In this aim, we will use both genetically engineered and
patient derived models of CMML to establish the clonal origin of inflammatory GMP, there self-renewing
capacity, and the impact of early therapy on this population of cells."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive and functional
impairment, and is a leading cause of death and disability in aging populations. As there is no cure for AD,
current research is focused on understanding early cognitive and behavioral changes to aid in earlier diagnosis
and treatment implementation. Older adults are prone to experiencing cognitive changes and changes in sleep
function and circadian rhythms, which regulate timing of physiology and behavior across the 24-hour day.
Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances negatively impact cognitive functioning, and are associated with
increased risk of cognitive decline and AD dementia. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is one of the earliest
observable changes preceding objective mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and often signals the need for a
cognitive evaluation. There is a paucity of research examining circadian rhythm disturbances in adults
experiencing SCD, and it is not well understood how circadian rhythm disturbances may relate to changes in
cognitive functioning in this population. Associations with other factors known to relate to sleep and cognitive
functions, such as stress, are also understudied in this group. Examining circadian rhythm timing, their
associations with cognitive functions, and the influence of stress on these relations in SCD may reveal
predictive factors or treatments of cognitive decline targeted to the circadian timing system.
 The proposed study will examine circadian rhythm timing and cognitive functioning in adults over 50 who
(a) are experiencing SCD, (b) have MCI, and (c) are cognitively intact. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)
testing, actigraphy, and neuropsychological measures will be used to compare circadian rhythm timing and
cognitive functioning across these groups (N=90; 30 in each group). This study aims to examine: (1)
differences in circadian rhythm timing between study groups; (2) associations between circadian rhythm timing
and cognitive functioning in these three groups; and (3) whether perceived stress moderates these
associations. It is hypothesized that adults with SCD and MCI will exhibit advanced circadian phase, increased
fragmentation, and increased sleep irregularity compared to age-matched cognitively intact adults; that these
circadian disruptions will be associated with worse cognitive performance on objective neuropsychological
tests; and these associations will be moderated by stress ratings. Through this fellowship, the applicant will
gain valuable experience and hands-on training in sleep and neuropsychological research methods and
analyses, enabling her to comprehensively examine sleep-related risks of cognitive decline and AD.
Furthermore, she will build a network through training and research engagement at Boston University, Brigham
and Women’s Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Together, these experiences will provide her
with a deeper understanding of the relations between cognition and sleep in aging populations, and will
prepare her for a career as a clinical investigator of predictors and outcomes of age-related cognitive decline."

In an effort to slow transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19, or COVID), communities worldwide
have implemented strict quarantine policies. While these efforts appear to be having a positive public health
impact, they are negatively impacting economies, limiting personal resources for both COVID+ and non-
COVID infected patients, and exacerbating health disparities. Community service providers report steady
increases in calls for resources (e.g., for food, housing, transportation) during the COVID-19 pandemic,
particularly from underserved and underrepresented communities, and additional strain is being placed on
health systems. There is a critical need to identify how to overcome community service access barriers during
COVID-19, particularly for underserved communities. Our program of research has successfully leveraged
existing, low-cost technology to conduct social needs screening during busy emergency department (ED) care,
follow-up by United Way 211’s community referral service, and data exchange between systems, suggesting it
may be a solution for understanding and meeting the needs of vulnerable and underserved patients during the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, findings from our recent sample of approximately 5000 patients screened for
social needs during ED visits and qualitative data from service providers, 211 community information
specialists, ED Staff, and patients reveal that effectively addressing social needs and connecting to community
service providers requires thoughtful, targeted approaches in order to develop relationships among patients
and those involved in screening and outreach. Using a pragmatic trial approach in a sample of 1500 patients
screened for social needs in ED and community-based and mobile COVID testing sites, the objective of this
real world efficacy (NIH stage 3) study is to determine whether community service use for those with social
needs improves general and COVID-related health outcomes, and whether random assignment to intensive
follow-up and collaborative goal setting helps overcome barriers to community service use. We hypothesize
that patients who use community services to meet social needs will experience improvement in general and
COVID-specific health outcomes, and that patients randomized to a collaborative goal setting process with a
211 information specialist will have greater community service use. Given the unknown timeframe for social
distancing measures needed during the months or years ahead, it is critical to broadly understand the barriers
to, and facilitators of, COVID-19 prevention; and of how to address effects on social, mental, and physical
wellbeing among COVID-19 vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations."

A frequent gain of function promoter polymorphism for the PAI-1 gene (~60% of the population are
homozygous or heterozygous) is associated with elevated circulating PAI-1 levels. Children homo or
heterozygous for this allele who had a medically attended respiratory viral illness before age 2, had a 12 (any
virus) to 18-fold (RSV) increased risk of asthma. The mechanisms for this association are not established. PAI-
1 is associated with airway thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) production, which promotes Th2 type airway
responses. Furthermore, the PAI-1 overproducing genotype is associated with increased serum levels of IgE.
IgE elevation increases FcεRI levels on pDCs which attenuates type I interferon antiviral responses. Of note,
soy isoflavones reduce TGF-1-induced PAI-1 gene expression and protein production from airway epithelial
cells, and have been shown to decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations by 70% in individuals with the
genotype. It is not known whether supplementation with soy isoflavones will decrease the risk of developing
Th2 airway inflammation or the likelihood of allergic sensitization if it is given to children at risk of asthma in the
first year of life. Soy Isoflavones for Inner City Infants at Risk for Asthma (SIRA) is a single center,
prospective randomized, quadruple masked trial of high-risk infants with the PAI-1 genotype to compare
supplementation with soy genistein at doses similar to soy formula ingestion or placebo during peak viral
season of the first year of life. Children aged 2-6 months at enrollment will be randomized to soy isoflavone or
placebo in August, receiving active treatment from August to March 1st, followed by observation over the next
year for each yearly cohort. The objective of this proposal is to determine 1) whether soy isoflavones can
modulate development of Th2 airway endotypes, decrease eosinophilic airway inflammation, and reduce
sensitization in high risk infants with the PAI-1 risk genotype, and 2) decrease IgE production via effects on
PAI-1, and thereby improve rhinovirus-induced IFN-α response. As such, the primary outcome of the trial will
be the development of T2 airway endotypes by interrupting the PAI-1/TSLP axis. Secondary outcomes will
include nasal PAI-1, nasal ECP, nasal Th2 cytokine levels, serum periostin, total and specific IgE, and
respiratory morbidity. The secondary aim will determine if antiviral IFN-α responses by PBMC stimulated by
HRV and IgE crosslinking are augmented by soy genistein in a similar fashion as has been described for
omalizumab. Secondary outcomes for this aim will evaluate if soy genistein will augment IFN-α responses by
pDC in similar experiments. The current project uses a safe and inexpensive intervention, soy genistein,
directed to a common genotype as a precision medicine approach to provide a better understanding of key
pathways relevant to development of allergic airway inflammation in early life. If confirmatory, these results
would lead into intervention trials focused on clinical outcomes. This line of inquiry has the potential to benefit a
large number of children at risk of developing asthma."

A significant percentage of people in the US suffer from disabilities resulting from traumatic
injury, stroke, or degenerative disease which result in enigmatic deficits in cognitive function.
Therefore, an understanding of the fundamental properties of neuronal circuits for complex brain
function, and how these circuits are modulated by biogenic amines, will sharpen our
understanding of the normal brain, thereby highlighting pathology and facilitating treatments.
A major function of the brain is to integrate information across sensory modalities to enable
sharp and robust perception. The cell-circuit mechanism for how different sensory modalities
interact is not well understood. This project will capitalize on the significant experimental
advantages of the fruit fly Drosophila to explore the molecular logic and neural connections that
produce an elementary form of multisensory integration perception. The fly displays robust
multisensory perception, integrating olfactory signals with visual processing to enhance
perceptual abilities. Furthermore, sensory circuits have been shown to be under robust
neuromodulatory control by biogenic amines. Similar processes have been localized to sub-
cortical and cortical pathways in humans and non-human primates. The fly has a numerically
compact nervous system, with which highly advanced genetic techniques can be used to
identify, manipulate, and record activity from individual neurons and neurosecretory cells, as
well as their upstream and downstream synaptic partners and molecular components. The PI
hypothesizes that the fly brain couples olfactory sensory detection to visual processing through
neuromodulatory cells that carry the chemical equivalent of norepinephrine. The PI will perform
two-photon Ca2+ imaging to ‘read’ activity from live flies in response to stimuli the PI has
discovered elicit robust multi-modal integration behavior within a virtual reality system. The PI
will use optogenetics imaging to ‘write’ signals into these circuit pathways to assess input-output
functions from an intact behaving fly."

Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and a leading cause of cancer mortality among men
and women with the rates of bladder cancer incidents and bladder cancer-related deaths that have not
decreased over the last 40 years. Therefore, novel more precise treatment strategies are desired. Bladder
cancer has long been recognized as a malignancy that is responsive to immune-based therapy. One of the
novel immunotherapy approaches utilizes the adoptive cell therapy (ACT), where autologous tumor-infiltrating
T lymphocytes (TIL) are expanded and activated ex vivo and then reinfused into the cancer patient. However,
typical systemic administration of ACT-TIL requires prior lymphodepletion and thus TIL are injected
infrequently and in large numbers. Bladder is a specific organ which allows for intravesical delivery by direct
administration of drugs and T cells through a catheter making it amenable to multiple and more frequent
infusions of TIL and other therapeutics, potentially with smaller doses. This gives an unprecedented
opportunity to use mathematical modeling integrated with pre-clinical mouse models to design, optimize and
validate ACT-TIL combination therapies that will maximize tumor response and minimize toxicity. Our methods
include microscopic- and macroscopic-level in silico models supported by in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo
experimental data, defined T cells and a murine models of bladder cancer that mimic clinically-relevant
procedures. In Aim 1, we will develop in silico models to enhance T cell infiltration into the bladder tumors. In
Aim 2, we will optimize T cell properties ex vivo for the most effective T cell-cancer cell interactions. In Aim 3,
we will apply our integrated methodology to design most effective combination therapy protocols to increase
the effectiveness of reinfused TILs. The deliverables of this study will improve our understanding of how the
bladder tumor microenvironment impacts T cell infiltration and T cell-tumor cell interactions and will lead to
strategies that improve bladder cancer treatment by mathematically optimizing treatment schedules."

This application seeks to improve basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate cytoprotective
actions of coagulation proteases on cells and will test novel approaches for the potential treatment of thrombo-
inflammatory disease. Despite recent advances, major gaps in knowledge remain about the physiological and
pathophysiological mechanisms that are affected when vascular, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways
intertwine during bacterial or viral infection, and how unbalanced regulation of these pathways can fuel a vicious
cycle of vascular dysfunction, immunocoagulopathy, and thromboinflammation. Endogenous and pharmacologic
activated protein C (APC) has multiple beneficial effects in a diverse collection of preclinical animal injury models
where unbalanced regulation of vascular, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways contribute to pathogenesis.
These beneficial effects of APC are primarily mediated by the cytoprotective activities of APC that involve the
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and non-canonical activation of PAR1 at Arg46 and of PAR3 at Arg41,
which induce biased signaling pathways contributing to rebalancing tissue homeostasis and host defense
systems. A major focus of Aim 1 will be on the regulation of EPCR function during thromboinflammation. We
have identified a novel mechanism for the functional regulation of EPCR on cell surfaces and have discovered
an EPCR stabilizing antibody that greatly enhances the beneficial effects of the endogenous protein C system.
In vitro and in vivo studies will characterize the mechanism for the antibody’s augmentation of APC’s
cytoprotective effects and its translational potential in thromboinflammation. Aim 2 focusses on synthetic APC-
mimetic peptides derived from non-canonical PAR1 and PAR3 activation. These APC-mimetic peptides do not
require EPCR to provide anti-inflammatory and endothelial stabilizing activities and may provide critical vascular
protective effects when EPCR is disabled by inflammatory mediators during thromboinflammatory disease. Aim
2 studies will provide highly innovative knowledge on the structure-function of biased PAR1 and PAR3 signaling.
The emerging knowledge of the pathobiology of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a striking
dysregulation of host defense immune and blood coagulation systems, based on excessive levels of
cytokines/chemokines and D-dimer circulating in blood of severely ill patients. We hypothesize that EPCR
dysfunction, induced by the excessive cytokines/chemokines release in the circulation, contributes to vascular
dysfunction and impairments of the endogenous cytoprotective effects of APC in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
Aim 3 will characterize the contribution of EPCR in the pathogenesis of COVID 19 in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice
expressing human ACE2. Experimental treatments with our EPCR stabilizing antibody and our second-
generation PAR-sequence-derived peptide with improved APC-mimetic activities will be tested for efficacy to
mitigate the serious effects of murine COVID-19. These studies will improve our knowledge on the regulation of
EPCR function in thromboinflammation and may advance therapies for COVID-19 patients."

 The U.S. Dietary Guidelines (USDG) form the basis of federal nutrition programs and policy and
provide valuable guidance to health initiatives and industries. The updated 2015 USDG moved away from a
focus on individual nutrients to a greater focus on dietary patterns. The USDG state that healthy eating goals
can be met through a variety of dietary patterns, but present healthy diet in three main ways: 1) Healthy U.S.-
Style Eating Pattern, 2) Healthy Mediterranean-Style Eating Pattern, and 3) Healthy Vegetarian Eating Pattern.
Currently, US adults are falling short of the nutrition recommendations (fruit/vegetable intake, greens/beans,
whole grains, etc.) set forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI). While the USDG
are the basis of nutrition guidelines, the research informing these dietary pattern recommendations has largely
been drawn from observational studies among mostly white populations. In addition, there has been very
limited cultural-tailoring of these dietary patterns that would ensure that these diets are acceptable to diverse
populations, in particular, African Americans (AAs) living in the south, who experience a disproportionate
burden of chronic disease, especially type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Currently, US adults are not meeting nutrition
recommendations (fruit/vegetable, whole grains, etc.) set forth by the USDG and measured by the Healthy
Eating Index (HEI).
 For this study, AA adult participants with overweight/obesity and ≥three T2DM risk factors will be
recruited to participate in the following aims:
Aim 1: Conduct a 3-month randomized trial among AAs comparing adoption of the 3 dietary patterns
[1) US, 2) Med, or 3) Veg] using existing materials from the USDG and examine differences in diet
quality (HEI) and T2DM risk factors (weight, HgbA1c).
Aim 2: Drawing on participants’ experiences in Aim 1, conduct qualitative work to refine and culturally
tailor the dietary pattern intervention for an AA audience.
Aim 3: Based on the findings of Aim 2, conduct a one-year intervention using revised culturally tailored
materials to examine differences in HEI and T2DM risk factors among participants (n=198) randomized
to one of the 3 dietary patterns.
 This will result in community-based strategies around presenting dietary guidelines in a way to
effectively meet nutrition recommendations leading to significant impacts on health among AA adults."

 Heart failure is a major public health challenge. Impaired cardiac metabolism is one of the
fundamental mechanisms underlying heart failure progression. Expression profiling of cardiac tissues
reveals repressed transcription factor network activation in heart failure, including Peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), the master regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in many metabolic genes
downregulation. In contrast to heart failure, endurance exercise enhances cardiac energetics through the
upregulation of the PGC-1α expression, placing this molecule at the center of the exercise-induced
adaptive response. The molecular mechanisms governing the expression of PGC-1α in response to
exercise or pathological stress leading to heart failure are poorly understood. Mitochondrial function is
also regulated by post-translational modifications of mitochondrial proteins. Our group identified General
Control of Amino-Acid Synthesis 5-like 1 (GCN5L1) as the first acetyltransferase protein responsible for
dynamic mitochondrial acetylation regulating fatty acid oxidation. The role of GCN5L1 in cardiac
energetics regulation and heart failure are largely unknown. In our new preliminary data, we found that
GCN5L1 expression was decreased in human and murine failing hearts and cardiac GCN5L1 knockout
mice (cGCN5L1 KO) displayed exacerbated heart failure progression following transaortic constriction
(TAC), highlighting that GCN5L1 plays an important role in heart failure. Beyond nuclear-mitochondria
one-way communication, emerging evidence show that mitochondria can also engage in retrograde
signaling to the nucleus via metabolic intermediates, reactive oxidative species or peptides to reprogram
metabolic gene transcription. GCN5L1 is predominantly located in mitochondria and is absent in the
nucleus. In our preliminary data, the exercise induced PGC-1α upregulation was blunted in cGCN5L1
KO mice relative to WT controls, and PGC-1α expression was also decreased in TAC cGCN5L1 KO mice
hearts compared to TAC WT mice. These findings suggest that GCN5L1 plays an important role in
controlling PGC-1α expression. In this proposal, leveraging our novel genetic mouse model, we will
test the hypothesis that GCN5L1 plays a critical role in enhancing cardiac bioenergetics through
retrograde activation of PGC-1α signaling during exercise or heart failure development. Three
specific aims are proposed: 1) To test the hypothesis that GCN5L1 induces PGC-1α expression in
response to pressure overload through retrograde activation of p38 MAPK, 2) To test the hypothesis that
GCN5L1 induces PGC-1α expression in response to pressure overload through retrograde histone
acetylation at H3K27, 3) To test the hypothesis that GCN5L1 governs adaptive response to endurance
exercise through retrograde activation of PGC-1α signaling."

evidence for postpartum care, and important comorbidities that may impact outcomes. In 2017, the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) issued new guidelines to define chronic
hypertension by using lower systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) thresholds (stage 1 hypertension,
130-139/80-89; stage 2, ≥140/90 mmHg) down from ≥140/90. In 2019, the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists (ACOG) confirmed much of this recommendation but did not apply the lower BP thresholds
to diagnose new-onset HDP, due to the lack of data on the associations between these lower BP thresholds
with prenatal and postpartum complication. The ACOG also recognized it is not scientifically substantiated to
use the 20-week mark to determine whether hypertension predates pregnancy or is pregnancy-related, calling
for examination of BP trajectories across pregnancy. Further, due to fragmented postpartum care, little is
known about postpartum hypertensive disorders and associated hospitalization and severe maternal morbidity.
Finally, pre-existing obesity and diabetes often cluster with HDP and complicate the association between BP in
pregnancy and risk of complications. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose a population-
based cohort study of ~0.5 million demographically diverse women who delivered singletons in 2007-2019 at
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated health care system with a stable membership
and comprehensive electronic medical record data. We are uniquely positioned to timely address the important
concern regarding the unknown association of the 2017 ACC/AHA defined BP categories in pregnancy with
perinatal and postpartum complications (Aims 1-2). Leveraging KPNC’s unique longitudinal tracking of BP and
weight before, during, and after pregnancy and robust diabetes diagnosis data before pregnancy, we will be
able to efficiently dissect the joint effects of BP in pregnancy with comorbid obesity and diabetes on perinatal
and postpartum complications (Aims 1-2). Finally, we will examine BP trajectories on a continuum before 20
weeks of gestation and across pregnancy with risk of complications (Aim 3). This study provides a timely and
unparalleled opportunity to address the concerns arising from the conflicts between the ACC/AHA and ACOG
guidelines regarding how to manage pregnant women with BP levels lower than conventional thresholds. Our
findings may help identify at which BP level, and in which time window, closer patient surveillance and change
in management may be initiated. Further, our findings may provide clinicians with sorely needed data to inform
early clinical triage and risk stratification of women with combinations of certain BP categories in pregnancy
and comorbid obesity and diabetes, thus enhancing individualized care decision and efficiency."

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United
States, and annually accounts for nearly 500,000 deaths worldwide. Currently, the small molecule kinase
inhibitor (KI) regorafenib is the primary second line therapy for metastatic CRC that is not treatable with
immunotherapy or anti-EGFR therapies. However, regorafenib generally provides only modest improvements in
survival— typically months—and often at the cost of significant side effects. Proposed targets for regorafenib
include kinases that act within tumor cells as well as non-autonomously; however, with over 500 possible targets
in the human kinome, the exact mechanism by which this compound operates remains controversial and not
fully known. This presents a daunting challenge; without a verifiable target or mechanism, no clear path exists
to guide the development of improved therapies for mCRC.
 Here, we propose an alternative approach to drug development that focuses on kinase networks in the
context of the whole animal. Specifically, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to define kinases that are
beneficial to inhibit (‘pro-targets’) or avoid (‘anti-targets’) in the context of KRAS-variant CRC. Using Drosophila
and mammalian models, we will identify kinases that—when reduced—alter the efficacy of regorafenib and
similar compounds. We will also conduct extensive structure-activity relationship analyses, evaluating how
modifications in already identified lead compounds impact changes in efficacy and therapeutic index. Finally, we
will use computational structural biology to convert our chemical genetic insights into highly optimized and
precise polypharmacological leads. In this final step, we generate new analogs to selectively eliminate putative
anti-target activity while maintaining or increasing inhibitory activity against other beneficial targets.
 We have used our chemical genetic platform to identify a promising lead compound, APS5-86-2, that
demonstrates significant activity relative to regorafenib in several mCRC models, including human patient
derived xenografts (PDX). Comparative analysis suggests that the improved activity of APS5-86-2 relative to
regorafenib derives from distinct polypharmacology on several RTKs and critical cancer drivers, including CDK9,
AURKA, EGFR, BRAF, and RAF1. In this proposal, we examine the mechanism and importance of these and
other putative pro- and anti-target kinases using genetic analysis and in vivo target engagement. The objective
is to identify the kinase networks that mediate KRAS-variant mCRC by combining chemical biology with genetics,
and to then derive inhibitors that best attack these networks through structure-based drug design. We have been
successful previously with a similar approach, but in less complex tumor models (Dar et al., Nature, 2012;
Sonoshita et al., Nature Chem. Bio., 2018); here we seek to extend our platform to a more prevalent disease
with the goal of directly impacting mCRC by creating new, highly differentiated, and improved drugs."

Alterations in hemodynamic shear stress at atherosclerosis-prone sites promotes endothelial activation,
characterized by nuclear factor-B (NF-B)-driven expression of cell adhesion molecules that mediate leukocyte
homing. In addition to flow patterns, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1) promote NF-B-dependent
endothelial activation. While the recent CANTOS trial using an IL-1 antagonist highlights the potential for
treating atherogenic inflammation beyond lipid lowering therapies alone, our understanding of how endothelial
activation contributes to this effect remains limited. During the previous funding period, my laboratory identified
the signaling adaptor Nck1 as a critical regulator of atherogenic endothelial activation. Endothelial cells deficient
in Nck1 lack flow-induced NF-B activation and proinflammatory gene expression both in vitro and in vivo, and
domain swap experiments and point mutation analysis suggest a critical role for the Nck1 SH2 domain and the
first Nck1 SH3 domain in mediating these effects. To understand how Nck1 mediates atherogenic endothelial
activation, we isolated Nck1’s proinflammatory functions to the Nck1 SH2 domain and fist SH3 domain.
Additionally, we demonstrated an interaction between Nck1 and IL-1 signaling in response to disturbed flow,
showing that disturbed flow activates the IL-1 receptor (IL1R1) signaling partner IRAK-1 in a Nck1-dependent
manner both in vitro and in vivo. IRAK-1 depletion inhibited the proinflammatory response to disturbed flow, but
the mechanism by which disturbed flow stimulates IRAK-1 signaling remains unknown.
The Nck family of signaling adaptors (Nck1 and Nck2) play redundant roles during vascular development and
retinal neovascularization, with defects only observed when both isoforms are inhibited. Consistent with our cell
culture studies, global Nck1 knockout mice show reduced atherosclerosis characterized by diminished
macrophage and smooth muscle incorporation, whereas endothelial Nck2 knockouts do not. While bone marrow
chimeras suggest non-hematopoietic Nck1 mediates this response, questions concerning the relative roles of
endothelial and smooth muscle Nck1 in this response persist. A recent GWAS analysis linked Nck1 to coronary
artery disease, underscoring its importance to human disease. Therefore, we hypothesize that Nck1 adaptors
mediate the formation of IL-1-related signaling complexes to induce atherogenic endothelial activation, and
selective inhibition of Nck1 or its critical domains will allow efficient inhibition of atherogenic endothelial activation
without affecting ischemic vascular remodeling. We will determine the mechanisms by which Nck1 regulates
disturbed flow-induced IRAK-1 activation (Aim 1), characterize the interplay between Nck1 and IL-1-associated
signaling in disturbed flow-induced endothelial activation in vivo (Aim 2), and assess whether selective Nck1
inhibition differentially affects atherosclerosis and ischemic angiogenesis (Aim 3). Successful completion of
these aims will identify new mechanisms by which Nck1 mediates atherogenic endothelial activation and will
characterize Nck1 as a therapeutic target to limit atherosclerosis."

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that presents with progressive motor, psychiatric,
and cognitive symptoms leading to early disability and mortality. Although significant advances have been
made in identifying pathogenic pathways and screening of potential drug targets, no treatments to delay the
onset or slow the disease progression exist yet. Thus, there is a need for fresh perspectives on the disease
pathogenesis to discover novel therapeutic targets and to facilitate treatment development for HD. This
proposal’s foundation is rooted in the discovery of impairment of the “glymphatic system” in HD brain.
Glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular network that facilitates the exchange of interstitial fluid and
cerebrospinal fluid and clears waste products from the brain. This drainage system is supported by aquaporin-
4 (AQP4) water channels which present with high density in perivascular astrocytic endfeet membranes:
termed AQP4 polarization. AQP4 polarization requires presence of a functional protein complex composed of
a key protein, α1-syntrophin (SNTA1). While multiple independent studies have speculated that the glymphatic
system may play a role in the clearance of neurodegenerative disease-relevant proteins, there is limited direct
evidence available on how this system is altered in HD, and whether its disruption contributes to HD pathology
and disease manifestation. We developed a molecular MRI technique, dynamic glucose-enhanced MR
imaging. Using this MRItechnique, we discovered that D-glucose clearance is significantly reduced in a mouse
model of HD, and glymphatic clearance is impaired prior to brain pathology and motor deficits. We also found
that AQP4 loses its polarization in the HD brain and SNTA1 protein levels were reduced in HD brains. Based
on these findings, we hypothesize that loss of perivascular AQP4 polarization impairs glymphatic function,
consequently preventing mutant HTT clearance and accelerating HD neuropathology and disease progression.
Aim 1 is to define whether glymphatic impairment precedes the development of pathology and behavioral
deficits in HD mice. Aim 2 is to determine whether loss of perivascular Aqp4 polarization by Snta1 knockdown
accelerates HD-like neuropathology and behavioral deficits in HD mice. Aim 3 is to evaluate whether
overexpressing Snta1 or combined with Aqp4 improves glymphatic function in HD mice and attenuates mHTT
accumulation and rescue HD manifestation. This project will reveal a mechanistic basis for identifying new
therapeutics as well as potential biomarkers for HD."

10833510,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-healing wounds in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are a major cause of increasing morbidity and
mortality. Failure of wound healing in T2D patients represents the most common cause of amputation in the US
with a 5-year mortality rate of nearly 50%. Thus, a critical need exists for understanding the wound healing
defects in T2D in order to develop targeted therapies. We have utilized both genetic (db/db) and dietary (diet-
induced obese) murine models of T2D as well as human wound tissue and blood samples collected from T2D
patients to explore mechanisms of impaired wound healing. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that
interactions between wound macrophages (Mφs), and CD4+T cells, via Notch signaling, dictate CD4+T cell
activation to ultimately regulate inflammation and healing in wounds. We and others have identified that a wound
CD4+Treg cell phenotype is critical for normal tissue repair, while a TH17 phenotype promotes excess
inflammation and impairs healing. Our preliminary data identify TLR4 signaling in wound Mφs upregulates the
Notch ligand, DLL4, which then interacts with the Notch 1 and 2 receptors on CD4+T cells to promote TH17 as
opposed to Treg differentiation. These interactions drive excess inflammation and pathologic healing in diabetes.
Additionally, the DLL4-Notch pathway may be further upregulated in diabetic wounds via epigenetic mechanisms
involving MLL1, a histone methyltransferase. MLL1 directly upregulates DLL4 in Mφs and can indirectly increase
DLL4 via TLR4 signaling in Mφs. In addition, MLL1 can directly increase Notch 1 and 2 receptor expression in
CD4+T cells, making them more receptive to Notch activation and promoting a prolonged TH17 response. These
changes then dictate the pathologic TH17 phenotype in diabetic wounds. These results have led to our
hypothesis that DLL4-mediated Notch receptor signaling in diabetic wounds polarizes CD4+T cells in the wound
towards TH17 and promotes chronic inflammation and non-healing. Further, increased downstream IL17A
signaling increases epidermal and dermal cell mediated inflammation in diabetic tissue. Our data suggest that
wound Mφ/CD4+T cell wound phenotypes may be restored via Mφ-targeted treatment (delivered locally to the
wound via engineered nanoparticles) with MLL1 inhibitor(s) or local treatment with anti-DLL4 antibodies. To test
our hypotheses, we will pursue the following aims: Aim 1: To examine the direct (MLL1) and indirect
(TLR4/MyD88) regulation of DLL4 in wound macrophages during normal and diabetic conditions. Aim 2:
To identify the role of Notch receptor activation on Treg/TH17 differentiation during normal and diabetic
wound repair. Aim 3: To compare local and Mφ-targeted therapies to reduce Notch signaling, limit TH17
differentiation, improve healing and identify the cellular targets for IL17A signaling in wounds."

 In 2018, the global incidence of new cancer diagnoses was estimated at over 18 million cases, and cancer-
related deaths were estimated at over 9.6 million. Of these cases, the vast majority were solid tumors,
accounting for more than 16 million new cases and 8 million cancer deaths. This includes soft tissue sarcoma
(STS), a heterogeneous group of aggressive malignant tumors that have a poor 5-year survival rate of only
65%. In the U.S., an estimated 13,000 people will be diagnosed with STS in 2020, and more than 5,000 will die
of the disease. For patients diagnosed with STS, treatment often involves chemotherapy with a cytotoxic agent
such as doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline that has been used to induce tumor regression in a variety of
neoplastic conditions. Dox is also known to induce immunogenic cell death and enhance tumor
responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Unfortunately, the extended use of Dox in patients
is limited by severe toxic side effects—most notably irreversible cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression—
which can be life threatening. Therefore, there is an immediate need for new methods to reduce the systemic
toxicity and off-target effects of Dox while maintaining its antitumor efficacy Shasqi has developed SQ3370, a
novel drug product that will improve the treatment of patients with injectable solid tumors undergoing
doxorubicin (Dox)-based chemotherapy. Preclinical studies done to-date have shown that SQ3370 results
in significant inhibition of tumor growth (both injected and non-injected tumors), immune activation,
prolonged survival, and protection against tumor rechallenge, while exhibiting reduced systemic side
effects compared to conventional Dox. Extensive preclinical data with SQ3370 has led to an open
investigational new drug (IND) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A Phase 1, first-
in-human, dose-escalation study is currently enrolling to evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
preliminary efficacy of SQ3370 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This Direct to
Phase II application seeks to expand this trial once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been reached
by adding a dose expansion cohort of 30 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma using a Simon two-stage design.
The aims of this project are to assess 1) safety/tolerability and 2) efficacy of SQ3370 in this cohort to determine
if the study should proceed to a Phase 2 clinical trial. These aims will accelerate development of SQ3370, a
novel therapy that promises to ultimately result in improved treatment and outcomes for millions of patients
with solid tumors."
10837805,"Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy
Project Summary
Organ motion is a predominant limiting factor for the maximum exploitation of modern radiation therapy
(RT). Adverse influence of the organ motion is aggravated in hypofractionated treatment because of
protracted dose delivery. Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers
(FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible
bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of
deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained
deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation
of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly
reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based
tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to
localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential
clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly
accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution
for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this
investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation
oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT.
Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study
should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical
capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and
that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact
on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion."
10844357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Steroid hormones in humans and other animals coordinate physiological and behavioral processes underlying
optimal responses to the social environment. The brain is a major site of steroid hormone action; however, our
knowledge of the role of steroid hormones in regulating gene expression and neuroplasticity in the brain is in
its infancy. It has been a challenge to disentangle the role of steroid hormones on brain function because they
broadly influence physiology and behavior, making it difficult to characterize direct versus indirect effects.
Thus, researchers wishing to use animal models of the hormonal modulation of the brain should have the
ability to study separately the physiological and behavioral effects of steroid hormones. My research program
aims to uncover the connections between steroid hormones, gene expression in the brain, and neuroplasticity
using Astatotilapia burtoni, a cichlid fish that exhibits sophisticated social dynamics. In the wild as in the
laboratory, male A. burtoni stratify along a social hierarchy where dominant males possess bright coloration,
aggressively defend a territory, and mate with females, while non-dominant males do not. Female A. burtoni do
not form a social hierarchy but behave aggressively towards one another for mating opportunities. Social rank
is in flux, as dominant and non-dominant males can change their status depending on the social milieu. These
complex social interactions are tightly linked to levels of a class of steroid hormones called androgens. My
research program will leverage the social dynamics of A. burtoni in the laboratory to discover the role of
androgens in controlling genes in the brain and neuroplasticity. We will tackle these questions using cutting-
edge techniques such as single-cell genomics, whole-brain imaging, and rich social behavior paradigms. For
these experiments, I have used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to genetically delete distinct androgen
receptors (ARs) in A. burtoni. These mutant A. burtoni lack functional genes for ARα, ARβ, or both. Findings in
these mutants reveal ARα and ARβ are required for distinct physiological and behavioral aspects of social
status, making them ideal for the proposed projects. For example, ARα mutant males do not perform dominant
social behaviors but have large testes and bright coloration, while ARβ mutant males perform dominant social
behaviors but possess small testes and drab coloration. Males mutant for both receptors lack all of these traits
and actually perform female-typical behaviors. As no other laboratory in existence possesses these AR
mutants, my research program is highly innovative and in a unique position for addressing these questions.
These experiments will be performed in both males and females, yielding novel results about the role of steroid
hormones in regulating fundamental brain and behavioral functions. With foundational data from AR mutant A.
burtoni, we will be able to address fundamental questions regarding the hormonal control of the brain and
social behavior. Indeed, these questions may connect naturally to those on the hormonal control of social
behavior in other species such as humans and how social systems emerge throughout evolution."
10806985,"Our current research focuses on investigating the mechanisms by which bioactive lipids modulate the function
of vascular and sensory transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Members of the TRP ion channel
subfamily are involved in various physiological processes, including temperature, chemical, and noxious stimuli
detection, as well as osmoregulation and neuronal and vascular function. TRP channel dysfunction underlies
different pathophysiological conditions such as pain hypersensitivity, peripheral neuropathies (e.g., during
diabetes), inflammation, hypertension, neurological disorders (e.g., cerebellar ataxia), and kidney disease. Since
TRP channels play critical roles in health and disease, there are many challenges that agonists and antagonists
must overcome during clinical trials due to their side effects. We envision that new strategies that fine-tune TRP
channels function, while maintaining their physiological roles, might circumvent undesired side effects of
pharmaceutical drugs. In the past five years, we have gained insights into the mechanisms by which
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), phosphoinositide lipids, and diacylglycerol regulate the function of TRPV4,
TRPV1, and TRPC6, respectively. Combining various in vitro and in vivo approaches, we aim to depict the
mechanism by which ω-3 PUFAs increase TRPV4 function and its potential for ameliorating channel-mediated
vascular dysfunction. Moreover, we will focus on determining the structural bases of the TRPV1 C-terminal
domain interaction with the plasma membrane and the intrinsic sensitivity of TRPC channels to bioactive lipids.
Taken together, our proposed work is expected to provide the molecular framework for understanding how
bioactive lipids fine-tune TRP channel function in the vascular and nervous systems. These findings will, in turn,
facilitate the development of strategies to target TRP channels, without disrupting normal physiology."

Establishing a reliable method to achieve allograft tolerance remains an ultimate goal in organ transplantation.
We previously reported long-term immunosuppression (I.S.)-free renal allograft survival in humans after
induction of only transient hematopoietic chimerism through donor bone marrow transplantation. To expand the
application of our approach, it is now imperative to 1) improve the consistency and robustness of hematopoietic
chimerism and allograft tolerance; 2) refine the conditioning regimen by identifying novel agents that can induce
mixed chimerism without genotoxic adverse effects; and 3) expand the understanding of mechanisms whereby
I.S.-free renal allograft acceptance via induction of transient mixed chimerism is achieved.
There is ample evidence that proinflammatory responses during the peri-transplant period adversely affects long-
term outcome of the allograft and tolerance induction. Integrin CD11b/CD18 (CD11b) is highly expressed on the
surface of innate immune cells and modulates several key proinflammatory functions in innate immune cells.
Our previous studies showed that blocking CD11b with mAb107, a first-in-class pure antagonist of CD11b,
markedly limits reperfusion injury after prolonged warm ischemia of native kidney or kidney allografts in
nonhuman primates. These observations led to our preliminary studies for this application that revealed superior
long-term outcome of renal allografts as well as improved hematopoietic chimerism in recipients of mAb107.
Therefore, in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that blocking CD11b with mAb107 in our mixed chimerism
protocol will induce a more robust allograft tolerance.
To reduce comorbidity of our conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation, we recently showed that
selective Bcl-2 inhibition with Venetoclax significantly promotes hematopoietic chimerism and allograft tolerance
with minimal myelosuppressive complications. However, complete elimination of genotoxic treatments from the
conditioning regimen was not achieved with Bcl-2 inhibition and a minimal non-toxic dose of total body irradiation
(TBI) was still required. ImmTOR is synthetic biodegradable nanoparticles encapsulating rapamycin. It can be
rapidly endocytosed by dendritic cells and other myeloid cells and induces antigen-specific non-responsiveness
in NHPs and humans. We therefore hypothesize that potent immunomodulatory effects of ImmTOR may more
effectively protect allogeneic HSCs from alloimmune responses, allowing engraftment of HSCs without any
genotoxic treatments. Our preliminary studies with ImmTOR are encouraging with multilineage mixed chimerism
being induced without irradiation and chemotherapy.
Finally, we will elucidate the mechanistic pathways involved in successful I.S.-free renal allograft survival by
transient hematopoietic chimerism induced by mAb107 and ImmTOR, utilizing extensive in vitro and in vivo
experiments with novel immunological approaches. Our hypothesis is that the major tolerance mechanism will
be defined as regulatory but deletional mechanisms are also involved."
10847337,"Population Genomics of Host-Microbiome Interactions
 There is wide variation in the composition of the microbial communities that colonize the human body
across individuals and populations, and this variation has been associated with numerous host traits and
diseases. Understanding the factors that influence this variation, and the mechanism by which this variation
affects host traits, is of central goal in human disease research. Although some of the variation in the
microbiome is controlled by host genetics, we know very little about the genomic factors that control the
interaction between humans and the microbiome and their effect on complex human disease. Disentangling
genetic from environmental effects on the microbiome is challenging, and the microbiome is usually profiled in
a single time point, which doesn’t account for microbiome longitudinal variation. Moreover, most of our
knowledge on host-microbiome interactions consists of correlational associations, and we do not know how
inter-individual and inter-population variation in microbiome composition affects host gene regulation.
 My laboratory’s research aims to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Research in my lab is based on
the hypothesis that the microbiome can be considered a quantitative trait, and thus we can directly map host
genomic factors controlling the variation in the microbiome, as well as identify individual host genes and
pathways that are regulated by the microbiome. My lab’s research program for the next five years is designed
to answer fundamental questions about the genomic basis of host-microbiome interactions via three broad,
complementary Project Areas, aiming to: (1) develop computational techniques to integrate microbiome and
host genomic data, and apply these methods to achieve a systems-level understanding of host-microbiome
interactions across populations and disease states; (2) characterize the heritability of functional components of
the microbiome (microbial genes, strains, and pathways) and assess the effect of life-long longitudinal
microbiome dynamics on host physiology in a primate model system; and (3) use novel in-vitro and ex-vivo
systems to understand the causal effect of inter-individual and inter-population variation in the microbiome on
host gene regulation and describe the underlying regulatory mechanism.
 The proposed research program will provide a systems-level view of the molecular interactions between
host genes and microbial factors in the gut across populations, environments, and diseases; a characterization
of how microbiome longitudinal dynamics, as well as genes, pathways, and strains are controlled by host
genetic; and a description of the mechanism with which microbes regulate host genes. These results would
transform our understanding of the interplay between human genomics and the microbiome, explain how this
interaction affects disease, and enable development of microbiome-based therapeutics and diagnostics that
improve human health."

Kidney transplantation is the main therapy for end stage kidney disease (ESKD),1 however, 3-5% of grafts fail
yearly and only 50% remain functioning at ten years.2,3 The most common manifestations of graft loss are
poorly characterized histologic findings of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), 4-7 which are present in
up to a third of biopsies 6-month after transplant.8 Furthermore, endothelial cell injury is common in kidney
transplantation due to ischemic injury during procurement,9 and leads to impaired vessel integrity and
peritubular capillary loss, which have been shown to lead to IFTA.9-12 In addition, vessel integrity has been
proposed to have a protective impact on kidney function by reducing microvascular leakage of albumin13, and
reducing the recipient alloimmune response to damaged endothelial cells.9, 10, 14, 15 For this reason, we propose
to evaluate two vascular markers in the Angiopoietin family capturing blood vessel integrity [Angiopoietin-1
(Angpt-1), and -2 (Angpt-2)] in the setting of deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Activation of the Angpt-1
receptor, Tie-2, maintains vessel stability and integrity, but Angpt-2, a competitive antagonist to Angpt-1,
interferes with the Angpt-1-Tie-2 axis, and promotes vessel leakage.16 The balance of Angpt-1: Angpt-2
production determines the integrity of blood vessels.17 The goal of this proposal is to evaluate if blood
vessel integrity as measured by Angiopoietins will be prognostic of short and long-term graft function
in an effort to identify pathways for future intervention. The candidate hypothesizes that maintaining
vessel integrity (as measured by Angpt-1 and Angpt-2) will be associated with less fibrosis, and better graft
outcomes. In aim 1, we will prospectively enroll deceased donor transplant recipients as well as use a pre-
existing cohort of recipients to evaluate and externally validate the associations of perioperative Angiopoietins
with 1-year graft function. In aim 2, we will evaluate if Angiopoietins measured at a single time point are
associated with long-term graft failure (mean follow up of about four years) by using bio-specimens from the
pre-existing FAVORIT trial. In aim 3, we will test the associations of perioperative Angiopoietins with tissue
pathology on 6-month graft biopsies using our prospective enrollment cohort. More specifically, we will
evaluate if Angpt-1 and -2 are associated with 6-month IFTA, peritubular capillary loss and vessel permeability
on histology. Understanding the role of vessel integrity as measured by Angiopoietins in allograft outcomes
may help identify pathways for future intervention and risk stratify recipients for more targeted trials and clinical
care."

based biomarkers (pTau-181) predictive of AD risk. Next, we will examine the general booster efficacy (pre- vs.
post-booster training), and the interaction between initial training and booster training by comparing the change
scores between groups. Finally, we will modify PACR-CT schedule with the optimal booster training interval
calculated based on the rate of natural cognitive decline measured from Aim 1 and the performance
improvement from the 10 weeks of booster training from Aim 2. Evaluation of the longer-term effect PACR-CT
and the booster effect will be used to obtain FDA clearance for the program and commercialize it as the
evidence-based prevention device indicated for age-related cognitive decline. This project should result in the
development of a new, and powerful tool to provide effective adjunctive therapy that results in far greater
resilience against cognitive impairment in a substantially greater pre-AD population."

This Direct-to-Phase II application aims to complete the preclinical development activities
required for the development of a novel treatment for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI), an area with a huge unmet need. TBI is characterized by an impact to the brain followed
by a development of a secondary injury that results from processes initiated by the trauma. The
secondary injury occurs in the hours and days following the primary injury and plays a large role
in the brain damage and death that results from TBI. There are currently general management
guidelines for patients with TBI with no specific neuroprotective interventions available. We
propose to validate a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of moderate to severe TBI.
AivoCode, Inc. has developed CAQK, a proprietary peptide, for the management of TBI. CAQK
specifically targets both penetrating and contusion type of brain injuries and has a pluripotent
effect when administered early on in the injury by limiting the secondary damage in TBI. This
effect results in improved healing of the injuries as well functional recovery in rodent model of
TBI. In this application, we will conduct efficacy studies in pig model of focal TBI and generate a
pharmacokinetic profile in a gyrencephalic model of TBI. We will also complete pre-clinical
studies that include CMC, formulation development and non-GLP toxicology studies needed for
an IND (Investigational New Drug) application for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
initiate clinical trials of CAQK for treatment of TBI."
10800721,"The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN, PP2B) is a pleiotropic signaling enzyme
important for the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. While CaN inhibition will attenuate pathological cardiac
remodeling, therapeutic targeting of CaN is problematic as clinically established CaN inhibitors are
immunosuppressant and as CaN targeting can worsen myocardial injury due to ischemia/reperfusion. In theory,
however, if CaN signaling pathways mediating pathological cardiac hypertrophy could be targeted in isolation, a
new therapeutic paradigm could be established. Two isoforms of CaNA, α and β, are expressed as proteins
equally in the heart, and yet genetic targeting of CaNAβ (PPP3cb) is sufficient to blunt pathological hypertrophy
in mice. We recently discovered that CaNAβ2 is targeted through its unique N-terminal polyproline (PP) domain
to a myocyte compartment organized by the scaffold protein Cdc4-Interacting Protein 4 (CIP4, TRIP10). Imaging
using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) reporters revealed that CIP4-bound CaNAβ2 is activated by
G-protein coupled receptor signaling, including angiotensin II, α- and β-adrenergic receptors, but not by pacing
that induces myocyte contraction. Notably, both CIP4 gene targeting and adeno-associated virus-mediated PP-
domain anchoring disruption inhibited cardiac remodeling and improved cardiac function in response to pressure
overload. Thus, CaNAβ PP-dependent anchoring constitutes a novel mechanism for specification of CaN
function, providing an explanation for the specific role of CaNAβ in the cardiac myocyte, as well as for the
important question why hypertrophic CaN signaling is not active in normal contracting myocytes. In this project,
we will test the novel hypothesis that in the cardiac myocyte PP-domain anchoring and CIP4 compartmentation
confer CaNAβ2 action selectively promoting pathological cardiac hypertrophy, thereby comprising a new
therapeutic target for the prevention and/or treatment of heart failure. Specific Aim 1: Localization and
function of the CIP4 signaling compartment. This Aim will define CIP4 localization in the myocyte, study the
relevance of the various CIP4 domains for myocyte hypertrophy, and explore whether CIP4-associated CaNAβ2
acts locally or distally from CIP4 complexes to promote hypertrophy. Specific Aim 2: Regulation of Ca2+ in the
CIP4-CaNAβ2 compartment. Functional independence of a Ca2+ signaling compartment requires mechanisms
for both local influx of Ca2+ and for insulating the compartment against elevations in Ca2+ associated with other
cellular functions. In this Aim, we will define the source of Ca2+ and how this compartment is insulated using live
myocyte imaging. Specific Aim 3: PP-anchored CaNAβ and ischemic heart disease. This aim will test
whether targeting of PP-anchored CaNAβ can attenuate the development of heart failure without worsening
myocyte survival in ischemic heart disease, These Aims will elucidate how PP-domain-mediated anchoring
CaNAβ confers activation within a novel Ca2+ compartment, providing both novel insights regarding specificity in
phosphatase signal transduction and further evidence supporting a novel therapeutic approach for heart failure."
10831039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The genetic information encoded in our genome is decoded and implemented via many multi-step processes,
including the proper decoding by transcription. Transcription of genes into mRNA by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)
is a complex process that is precisely regulated both temporally and spatially at multiple steps by many large
molecular complexes (LMCs). In the past, a number of these LMCs have been identified and their structural and
functional role has been studied. Although we have learned a great deal about these LMCs at an individual level,
how these LMCs interact and affect one another and Pol II at a more comprehensive level has yet to be achieved.
In this project, we are proposing a multi-prong approach to define interactions and structures of LMCs, Pol II,
and model transcription factors (TFs) in an unbiased way and, as much as possible, under native conditions. We
will also evaluate the function of these specific interactions on the molecular mechanics of transcription and
regulation in cells. To this end, we will utilize a novel GFP aptamer-based purification method to identify LMCs
and TFs that associate with GFP-tagged Pol II and other critical LMCs. Purifications will be performed rapidly
and under native conditions to ensure retention of physiological interactions, and the resulting complexes will be
analyzed by both Mass Spectrometry and Cryo-EM to define the composition and structure of these LMCs at the
highest depth and resolution possible. Crosslinking with novel protein-protein crosslinkers and subsequent MS
analysis (XL-MS) will also be used to capture more transient LMC and TF interactions. In parallel, LMC-APEX2
fusions will be used to biotinylate nearby proteins and identify them by MS analysis following streptavidin
purification. Additionally, we will define the location of distinctly modified Pol II complexes or Pol II associated
with distinct LMCs at base-pair resolution along transcription units using our new PRO-IP-seq protocol. This
information combined with the MS analysis provides a unique and dynamic view of Pol II’s phosphorylation
status, composition, associations, and precise positioning along genes, and this information will be critical in
deriving molecular models of transcription and its regulation. Previously known and newly identified LMCs and
TFs that are deemed to have critical interactions will be perturbed by either RNA aptamer inhibitors or degron-
tagging to tease apart their functional roles. The rapid expression RNA aptamers, which interfere with specific
LMC interactions, and the rapid degradation of whole LMC subunits with degron technology will allow the
detection of the immediate, “primary” roles of those interactions genome-wide using the high-resolution assays
such as PRO-seq and ChIP-Exo. These assays will enable us to identify the specific functions of the key LMCs
and their interactions at an unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Overall, we expect to derive a much better
and more complete understanding of the transcription cycle and its regulation. This will impact human health by
identifying new therapeutic venues and possible lead drugs (RNA Aptamers), as misregulation of transcription
has been observed in many disease conditions."

Older adults are extremely susceptible to chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers (VLUs), diabetic foot ulcers
(DFUs) and pressure ulcers (PUs). These wounds are difficult to treat and often drastic operative interventions
such as amputations or free flaps with a clear loss of function are necessary.
An increasingly popular approach for the treatment of chronic wounds is the use of recombinant biologics such
as growth factors (GF). Elegant work by researchers over the years has shown successful healing induced by
numerous GFs in various preclinical wound models developed in animals. Despite these promising results,
successful translation of GFs to human patients remains limited. We have identified that this can be attributed to
the presence of high levels of proteases present in human chronic wounds that result in rapid degradation of the
GF rendering the therapy ineffective. Most animals models of wound healing do not exhibit high protease levels
and thus therapies that tend to look promising in animals fail to translate to humans.
We have developed innovative nanoparticles (NP) that not only deliver the GF at the wound site but also protect
it from protease mediated degradation. Our work has shown that these NPs improve the half-life of the growth
factor in human chronic wound fluid and wound healing in young diabetic mice in the presence of proteases. In
this proposal, we intend to translate these promisinig NPs towards the healing of chronic wounds in the elderly.
However, there are significant differences in the wound healing of aged and young animals. Therefore, in the
R21 phase we propose to test the NPs in aged wounds and in the R33 stage we will focus on the preclinical
development of the NPs. We will use this data to prepare an FDA application for first in human studies focused
on efficacy of NPs on the healing of chronic wounds. This project will enable us to bring this promising technology
closer to the bench side. As a new therapy for the treatment of difficult to heal chronic wounds, it will significantly
reduce the cost and burden of chronic wounds in the health care system while improving patient outcomes and
quality of life."
10810736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The proposed K01 project will use multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and machine learning (ML)
to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underlying treatment failure in young adults with opioid use disorder
(OUD). Young adults are at particularly high risk of OUD and fatal opioid overdose. The monthly injectable
extended-release opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a highly effective OUD treatment and is particularly
well suited for young adults. However, XR-NTX adherence and relapse show considerable individual variability,
and the behavioral and clinical factors associated with such variability remain inconclusive. Previous research
has demonstrated the potential for multimodal MRI and ML techniques to elucidate the neurocognitive factors
that contribute to treatment response beyond behavioral and clinical measures. This project will take advantage
of the cutting-edge MRI and ML methods to model brain structures and functions that predict XR-NTX treatment
outcomes in young adults with OUD. The study will evaluate 18–34 year-old OUD patients before and during
the first three months of XR-NTX treatment, a period associated with the highest rate of dropout from treatment.
The primary outcome will be opioid relapse confirmed by weekly urine toxicology and self-report. The secondary
outcome will be non-adherence defined as failure to complete the first three injections. The study will focus on
five baseline measures of brain structures and functions that are potentially predictive of treatment response: 1)
grey matter volume; 2) functional connectivity with the ventral striatum; 3) reactivity to opioid cues; 4) inhibitory
control; and 5) self-evaluation. ML techniques will be used to reveal the patterns of brain structures/functions
that are associated with each outcome variable. Based on literature and preliminary findings, we anticipate that
combining MRI with behavioral and clinical assessments will better account for individual variability in XR-NTX
treatment outcomes in young adults with OUD, than using the behavioral and clinical variables alone. The data
will unveil novel brain mechanisms that contribute to the risk of treatment failure in this critical population. The
project will also serve as a training vehicle for Dr. Zhenhao Shi to improve his clinical and computational skills
and facilitate his independent career development. Specifically, it will enable Dr. Shi to achieve five training
goals: 1) to advance his knowledge in the methodology of clinical research; 2) to gain hands-on experience in
leading clinical projects; 3) to master ML and multivariate methodologies; 4) to apply multimodal MRI
techniques to translational and clinical research; and 5) to advance his general independent research skills
including leadership, networking, collaboration, scientific writing and grantsmanship. Through a combination of
didactic and hands-on activities, the project will fulfill Dr. Shi's training needs and enable his transition to a
successful and independent research career in applying advanced computational approaches to the
neuroscience research of substance use disorders and their treatments."
10810832,"ABSTRACT
The prognosis for patients with advanced stage ovarian or pancreatic cancer has remained dismal for
decades. The poor response rates result, in part, from resistance to salvage chemotherapies, including
topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors such as irinotecan and topotecan. The full potential of Top1 inhibitors is
hindered mainly by two mechanisms: (1) ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) transporters (i.e., P-glycoprotein and
ABCG2) that actively pump drugs out of cancer cells, and (2) Upregulation of the DNA repair enzyme, tyrosyl-
DNA phosphodiesterase 1, which resolves the topoisomerase I-DNA cleavable complexes to allow DNA
religation and cell proliferation. It is becoming increasingly clear that no single treatment is likely to overcome
this complex problem, and combination treatments of newly emerging modalities may offer the most promise.
Here, we introduce a complementary, two-pronged approach to address chemoresistance: (i) Employing
photodynamic priming (PDP) to damage ABC transporters, improve the delivery of Top1 inhibitors, and reduce
the normal tissue toxicity, and (ii) Repurposing tetracycline antibiotics to inhibit the DNA damage repair
enzyme tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1. PDP is a clinically relevant, photochemistry-based modality that
involves light activation of photosensitizers to modulate nearby tissues or biomolecules without killing the cells.
This proposal leverages image-guided strategies and nanoscale engineering to develop Targeted Photo-
Activable Multi-Inhibitor Liposome (TPMIL) that co-delivers PDP, Top1 inhibitors, and tetracycline antibiotics in
the appropriate sequence with consideration of their mechanistic interactions. In addition to co-packaging Top1
inhibitors and antibiotics, TPMIL is surface modified with antibody-photosensitizer conjugates to target
epidermal growth factor receptor, which is frequently amplified in pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Using a novel
hyperspectral fluorescence microendoscope imaging system, we will longitudinally monitor photosensitizer
delivery and changes in ABC transporter expression to improve PDP and chemosensitization in vivo (Aim 1).
The mechanistic interactions between Top1 inhibitors and tetracycline antibiotics will be investigated in vivo,
with and without PDP (Aim 2). Biomarkers predictive of chemosensitization will also be identified. TPMILs will
be customized to target ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells while co-delivering photosensitizers, Top1
inhibitors, and tetracycline antibiotics (Aim 3). The safety and therapeutic efficacy of TPMIL will be determined
in PDX mouse models (Aim 4). We have demonstrated the clinical feasibility of PDP in patients with locally
advanced pancreatic cancer. For metastatic ovarian cancer, we envision a simple and feasible modification to
the standard clinical framework. TPMILs will be delivered intraperitoneally after surgical debulking of ovarian
tumors, and then light activated to trigger PDP and the release of chemotherapy and antibiotics. The
knowledge gained may play a transformative role in the development of improved therapeutic regimens that
are tailored to the molecular profile of advanced pancreatic and ovarian cancer in individual patients."
10749912,"In the United States, mid-life adults are staying in the workforce longer and are engaging in higher levels of
physical activity than previous generations, potentially extending their interactions with elements of the built and
natural environments that influence their experience of daily stress. The relationship between various types of
stress and alterations in cognitive functioning has been well documented, and there is growing evidence showing
a relationship between daily stress in mid-life and cognitive decline. Even though mid-life adults constitute one
of the largest portions of the current U.S. population, there is relatively little data about the experience of daily
stress and health outcomes in this age group. Perceived stress in mid-life adults has also been closely linked
with physical disability later in life. Mid-life adults of different socioeconomic status and race are subject to
structural inequality in their living environments. Those living in urban environments with higher levels of poverty
and violence are experience higher levels of environmental stress than those living in suburban or rural
environments. It is well documented that Blacks are exposed to environmental stressors more than Whites. In
this Stage 0 study of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, we propose to use our novel
custom-built Stress Reports in Free-living Environments (STRIVE) ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
mobile phone app to measure the experience of daily stress of mid-life adults in free-living conditions. Using our
novel app and capturing data in real time will allow us to determine (1) where and when daily stress happens for
mid-life adults, (2) whether mid-life adults’ daily stressors are linked to certain elements of the built and natural
environment, and (3) whether EMA measurement of daily stress is comparable to the ‘gold standard’ Daily
Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) measurement tool that captures daily stress at the end of the day in mid-
life adults (used in Midlife in the United State Survey (MIDUS)). These data will expand our understanding of
mid-life adults’ experience of stress in free living conditions and pave the way for data-driven individual and
community-based intervention designs to promote health and well-being in mid-life adults. Potential interventions
that could stem from our data include technology based ‘just in time’ interventions that account for spatiotemporal
location, mindfulness-based interventions that incorporate environmental stress triggers, and community-based
interventions designed to eliminate environmental stressors that are commonly experienced by mid-life adults
(e.g., congested areas)."

Project Summary
 Our laboratory has led three research programs at the interface of chemistry and evolution. In the first
program, we developed DNA-templated synthesis as a novel approach to synthesize and discover bioactive
small molecules and polymers that combines biological evolution with organic chemistry. In the second program,
we developed prime editing and base editing, two genome editing technologies that collectively enable precise
installation of point mutations, insertions, and deletions at targeted sites in mammalian genomes without
requiring double-stranded DNA breaks or donor DNA templates. In the third program, we have applied these
technologies to rescue animal models of human genetic diseases. This MIRA renewal seeks to advance these
three research programs towards novel small-molecule and genome-editing therapeutics.
 In the first program, we developed DNA-templated synthesis, generated libraries of DNA-templated small
molecules containing >250,000 unique macrocycles, and performed in vitro selections on these libraries to
discover novel kinase and protease inhibitors, including the first physiological inhibitor of insulin-degrading
enzyme (IDE). Recently, we discovered a new class of macrocyclic cyclophilin inhibitors that include CypD-
specific variants, and solved X-ray co-crystal structures of several inhibitors bound to CypD. We propose to
understand the interactions between these macrocycles and CypD, determine the cellular activity of these
compounds, and develop specific inhibitors of other cyclophilins. We will also screen a new DNA-templated
library of ~640,000 macrocycles against additional targets of therapeutic interest including DNA repair proteins,
tumor suppressors, E3 ubiquitin ligases, interleukin and interleukin receptors, deubiquitinases, and ATPases.
 In the second program, we developed base editing and prime editing, the two methods that enable
precision genome editing in mammalian cells without requiring double-strand DNA breaks or donor DNA
templates. Base editing installs transition mutations (C•G→T•A, or A•T→G•C) using programmable DNA-binding
proteins fused to natural or laboratory-evolved nucleobase deaminase enzymes, while prime editing enables the
installation of all possible types of small substitutions, insertions, deletions, and combinations thereof through
the use of Cas9–reverse transcriptase fusions that copy edited DNA information from an engineered prime
editing guide RNA directly into targeted sites in mammalian genomes. We propose to advance prime editing by
revealing the cell-state and cell-type requirements for efficient prime editing, engineering improved prime editing
systems, and developing methods for prime editor delivery into animal models of human genetic disease.
 In the third program, we have integrated base editing with in vivo delivery methods to directly correct the
mutations that cause genetic diseases, achieving phenotypic rescue in animal models of tyrosinemia75, genetic
deafnesses53,76, Niemann-Pick syndrome55, and progeria. We propose to apply base editing and prime editing to
validate novel in vivo approaches to permanently treat chronic pain and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)."

Our NIGMS-funded research emphasizes the interface between structural biology, molecular biophysics, and
immunology. Broadly speaking, we aim to connect the fundamental physical principles that govern protein
behavior with function in the immune system, relying on a wide variety of approaches in biophysics, structural
biology, computational biochemistry, and molecular immunology. In addition to providing mechanistic insight into
immunology, our work in this interface has been instructional for addressing basic rules of biomolecular
recognition and other protein behavior, as well as in the modeling and design of complex systems. In this
renewal, we propose to continue this interdisciplinary focus. Our studies emphasize T cell receptors (TCRs) and
their ligands, short peptides bound and “presented” by major histocompatibility complex proteins (peptide/MHC
complexes). TCR recognition of peptide/MHC complexes is the cornerstone of cellular immunity, as it defines
specificity and initiates the signaling that leads to T cell immune responses. Owing to the high diversity in both
receptor and ligand, as well as the myriad of processes in which these molecules participate, the TCRs-
peptide/MHC interaction is recognized as one of the most complex in biology. Deconstructing how specificity
emerges in the face of this extraordinary complexity, learning how to predict and manipulate TCR recognition
properties, and understanding the biophysics of T cell signaling processes remains at the core of our studies.
We are motivated not only by the desire to gain further mechanistic insight, but also by the growth of new
therapeutic approaches such as gene-engineered T cells and peptide-based vaccines. While there have been
immunotherapy successes, there have also been significant complications and confounding outcomes. It is
widely understood that an improved understanding of the fundamentals of immune recognition is needed for
such therapies to reach their potential. Our goals for the next five years include improving our understanding of
the mechanisms of TCR cross-reactivity and specificity, with an eventual goal of using structural information and
modeling to identify cross-reactive ligands. Advances here will require concomitant improvements in our ability
to model and score suboptimal (or as we call them, “sloppy”) protein-protein interfaces, which is a major part of
our focus. We also plan to assess the mechanism of enigmatic “catch bonds” in TCR-peptide/MHC interfaces
through the lens of physical chemistry, a view which has been largely absent from the discussion of catch bonds
in immunology. We also aim to bring elements of physical chemistry and structural biology into predictions of
immunogenicity, tackling this by considering the biophysics of protein-protein molecular recognition. Lastly, we
aim to continue our work on dynamic allostery, studying how protein dynamics contribute to immune recognition
and the still poorly-understood mechanism of T cell triggering. Our work remains highly collaborative and
interdisciplinary, allowing it to impact multiple fields in molecular and cellular immunology and protein biophysics."

The risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease originate in childhood and adolescence, track into
adulthood, and have deleterious effects on long-term biopsychosocial health. Phenotypic sleep and fitness are
strongly associated with mechanisms involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease
and its risk factors (e.g., elevated body-mass index, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, elevated serum lipids,
elevated blood pressure, inflammation, autonomic nervous system imbalance, poor nutrition and diet, and
physical inactivity). Sleep and fitness are essential interacting physiological functions that are associated with
robust metabolic, hormonal, and cognitive responses, as well as with genomic and metabolomic adaptive
mechanisms. Both insufficient sleep and poor fitness are at epidemic proportions in youth and are associated
with acute health threats and increased disease risk across the lifespan. However, little is known about the
underlying mechanistic pathways that govern the interactions between fitness and sleep in developing youth in
their modulation of cardiovascular disease risk. This proposed study aims to fill a crucial gap in the
understanding how sleep and fitness interact to impact cardiovascular disease risk factors. Here we propose
an ancillary study to the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), a multicenter NIH
Common Fund project that aims to discover the molecular transducers (""molecular map"") responsible for the
beneficial health effects of physical activity and fitness in humans across the lifespan. Adding sleep
assessment to the pediatric MoTrPAC study offers a transformative opportunity to begin to elucidate the
interacting mechanisms of the fitness and sleep in humans during adolescent transition, a critical period of
physical, neurobiological, and psychological development. This project proposes to evaluate a cohort of
children and adolescents across maturational stages who complete the MoTrPAC protocol, which includes two
phases: a Cross-Sectional phase, and an Endurance Exercise Intervention phase. Of note, this ancillary study
does not change the existing MoTrPAC protocol/intervention and does not include any additional interventions,
and is therefore not considered a clinical trial. This study will recruit subjects from the pediatric MoTrPAC study
and evaluate phenotypic measures of sleep at the end of each MoTrPAC phase. Data obtained will allow
exploration of fundamental mechanistic pathways underlying fitness-sleep interactions during adolescence and
guide development of future clinical trials aimed at determining optimal sleep-exercise regimens for physical
and mental health in various adolescent populations, including different racial/ethnic populations and medically
at-risk groups. In addition, results from this study will be added to the MoTrPAC data repository, yielding a rich
and unique dataset for further exploration of genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic interactions between sleep
and fitness as they impact cardiovascular disease factors."

 Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity especially among service-
members and veterans. mTBI is linked to long-term development of dementia conditions such as Alzheimer's
disease and related disorders, but the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms remain poorly-defined. Vascular
disease and cardiovascular risk factors are strongly linked with dementia. We propose to test the hypothesis that
long-term mTBI-induced cognitive dysfunction is due to, at least in part, persistent cerebrovascular dysfunction.
We will also test the hypothesis that early onset mTBI and later development of hypertension will have synergistic
effects on cerebrovascular and cognitive dysfunction compared to hypertension or mTBI alone. In Aim 1, we will
measure the temporal changes (subacute and chronic) in cerebrovascular and cognitive function in a rat model
of mTBI while establishing the mechanistic role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in mTBI-induce cognitive
impairment. Following midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery in Sprague-Dawley rats, we will measure
subacute (8 weeks) and chronic (12 months) cerebrovascular function (in-vivo by brain contrast MRI and ex-vivo
by measuring cerebral artery vasoreactivity) and cognitive function and establish their relationship. We will also
determine if early (starting at 2 weeks post-injury) or late (starting at 10 months post-injury) aerobic exercise
training will improve cerebrovascular function leading to improvement in cognitive function. We will identify
molecular mechanisms by which cerebrovascular function modulates cognitive function in mTBI by investigating
the role of endothelial function in the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In Aim 2, we will probe the
interaction between early onset mTBI and later development of hypertension in chronic cerebrovascular and
cognitive dysfunction. Here we will use rats genetically prone to develop hypertension (spontaneously
hypertensive rats) to determine the effects of early onset mTBI in modulating chronic cerebrovascular and
cognitive function. We will also have an exploratory aim to look at effects of mTBI in Sprague-Dawley and
hypertensive rats on cardiac structure and function and coronary artery function. The proposal could provide
critical and novel insights on the mechanisms underlying vascular dysfunction in TBI and their role in the
development of cognitive dysfunction."

 Despite the significant research effort of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, their
specific roles in the aqueous outflow pathway remain unclear. Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only
clinical treatment for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), no matter whether the patients have high (IOP > 21
mmHg) or normal-tension glaucoma (IOP ≤ 21 mmHg). Significant achievements have been made in
understanding the regulation of IOP and identifying therapeutic targets to lower IOP. We and others have
identified the association of rs76481776 in the MIR182 gene with POAG. However, it remains unknown how
miR-182-5p contributes to POAG risk. Without such knowledge, the development of miRNA-based glaucoma
therapy will likely remain difficult. Our overall objective is to determine how elevated expression of miR-182-5p
contributes to POAG with high IOP. The risk allele A of POAG-associated rs76481776 with POAG has been
reported to increase mature miR-182-5p expression in vitro, suggesting that elevated miR-182-5p expression
may contribute to POAG. We identified 2-fold higher miR-182-5p expression in glaucomatous aqueous humor
compared to controls. Our central hypothesis is that elevated expression of miR-182-5p affects IOP by regulating
the cellular functions of human trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells. Human
TM cells with induced premature senescence have 7-9 fold higher miR-182-5p expression, and overexpression
of miR-182-5p in these HTM cells leads to partial cellular senescence. miR-182-5p has been shown to target
genes in many pathways, such as CHEK2, FOXO1, MTSS1, and CYLD. The expression of miR-182-5p could
be induced by TGF-β treatment in cancer cells, leading to prolonged NF-κB activation, while TGF-β related
pathways have been shown to play essential roles in POAG and fibrosis. The rationale for this proposal is that,
once we determine how elevated miR-182-5p expression affects the cellular functions of human TM and SC,
certain genes or miRNAs could be manipulated either up or down pharmacologically, resulting in new and
innovative approaches to lower IOP and to delay/prevent the progression of glaucoma. In Aim 1, we will identify
molecular targets of miR-182-5p in primary human TM cells in vitro. Human TM cells will be subject to cyclic
mechanical stretch and tissue train 3D cell culture with uniaxial tissue stretch. We will perform whole proteomics
profiling and strand-specific RNA-Seq analysis to identify miR-182-5p target genes. In Aim 2, we will determine
the impact of miR-182-5p overexpression in the TM and SC on outflow facility and IOP levels in vivo using
transgenic mice. Upon successful completion, we expect to identify the specific molecular targets of miR-182-
5p in human TM and SC to lower IOP more effectively in glaucoma patients."

More than 8.5 million children in the USA speak Spanish at home (U.S. Census Table S1601, 2020) with about
a half million experiencing Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), a disorder in language learning and use
that cannot be attributed to limited language exposure, autism, intellectual disability, hearing impairment, etc.
(Norbury et al., 2016; Tomblin et al., 1996). One key challenge in serving bilingual children with DLD is the
mismatch between the language(s) they speak and the availability of Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs)
who can provide services in those languages. While it seems self-evident that a monolingual child should be
treated in their first language, currently there is no guidance for SLPs as to the language of intervention for
bilingual children (Kohnert et al., 2005). Hence, a critical question is what language(s) of treatment will best
serve children with DLD with different proficiency profiles in their development of both Spanish and English.
We ask first whether gains in the treated language(s) are influenced by the child’s proficiency in each language
(Aim 1). Cross-linguistic transfer has been documented in priming studies suggesting that underlying syntax
representations are interconnected. Transfer effects may make it possible for a child to improve in both
languages as a result of treatment in one language, provided that the child has adequate levels of knowledge
to connect the information provided in treatment across both languages. The clearest evidence of transfer can
be derived from assessing gains in the untreated language when treatment is presented monolingually (Aim 2).
Our own preliminary data suggest that recast therapy can result in gains in both English and Spanish for
children treated in just one language. In this study, we carry out a randomized controlled trial, enrolling 120
children with DLD between the ages of 4 and 6 who score below 40% correct on the use of conditional
adverbial clauses (if-then) and subject relative clauses (e.g., the doll that the girl loved…). Children receive one
of three possible treatments (English-only, Spanish-only, bilingual) for one grammatical structure for 9 weeks,
and then outcomes are re-assessed for both structures in both languages. The second grammatical structure
is then treated for 9 weeks, and outcomes are assessed a third time. Comparison of different treatment
approaches will inform our understanding of what is the best approach to therapy for bilingual children with a
particular proficiency profile. Comparison of gains across languages and targets will allow us to determine the
role of cross-linguistic transfer in language learning and to inform theoretical accounts of language
representation in the developing bilingual child."

a six-fold higher risk of severe hypoglycemia. Those severely affected have an estimated mortality of 3.4%.
IAH is characterized by defects in adrenergic symptoms and the counter-regulatory hormone response to
hypoglycemia. Only limited data are available regarding the evolution of IAH. To date, strategies to restore
hypoglycemia awareness have focused upon minimizing hypoglycemia exposure. While islet-cell
transplantation has met with success, this approach is reserved for only the most severely affected as it is
invasive, has strict eligibility criteria, requires long-term immunosuppression and is resource-intensive. So
far interventions incorporating education and technologies, including continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) and automated insulin delivery (AID), have had limited success, though studies have been small
and of short duration. We hypothesize that IAH evolves over many years, promoted by recurrent
hypoglycemia. In the absence of restoration of a glucagon response, IAH reversal may require an extended
period of near-absolute hypoglycemia avoidance. We also hypothesize that high intensity interval exercise
(HIIT), which elicits a counter-regulatory hormone response, even in those with severe IAH, may have an
adjunctive role in the restoration of hypoglycemia awareness.
We propose a randomized-controlled trial in a cohort of adults with type 1 diabetes with IAH using manual
insulin dosing. All will be provided with hypoglycemia recognition and avoidance psycho-education.
Participants (n=500 in total with 50 studied at our site) will be randomized to 2-years of insulin delivery
using the most advanced AID system available with and without adjunctive support for an HIIT program,
which will be compared with usual care. The primary outcome will be a composite of sympathetic
symptoms and the endogenous glucose production (EGP) response during hypoglycemic clamp studies.
Other outcomes are (i) counter-regulatory responses during clamp studies; (ii) percent time in CGM low-
glucose ranges in real-world conditions; and (iii) person reported outcomes, including hypoglycemia
awareness symptom scores. Type 1 diabetes cohorts without IAH and those who have had a successful
islet-transplant will be studied at a single time-point to provide positive control data. In addition, we will
follow a population-based pediatric cohort of over 1000 children, with 93% using CGM. Changes in CGM
low glucose time will be related to changes in Gold and Clarke scores over 4-years, with potential to extend
this with separate funding.
Data from this program of research will substantially advance knowledge of IAH and guide practical and
meaningful interventions."
10914768,"Project Summary We propose to continue the follow-up of the Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), a Cancer
Epidemiology Cohort of 116,430 women enrolled at ages 25 to 42 years in 1989. The NHSII is a unique cohort
in many ways, as the only large cohort of women enrolled before menopause and with over 30 years of
repeated measures of exposures. We have information on smoking, weight, medication use, diet, physical
activity, environmental GIS-based exposures, and medical diagnoses updated every two to four years. Further,
we have collected detailed data on in utero and infant exposures (from participants' mothers), diet during high
school, and other unique exposure information. We have nearly complete ascertainment of deaths using the
National Death Index and other methods. The active follow-up of the NHSII cohort remains high, with 88%
cumulative follow-up. The NHSII biorepository includes plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and first
morning urine samples from 29,611 women; two thirds of these women contributed timed follicular and luteal
premenopausal samples. In 2008 to 2011, 16,510 women provided second blood and urine samples when the
majority were postmenopausal. We also have cheek cell DNA from an additional 29,859 women. Adding to
these resources, we recently collected fecal and oral samples from nearly 20,000 participants for microbiome
analysis. We have collected archival tissue blocks for incident breast, ovarian, colorectal, endometrial cancers,
and lymphomas and melanoma, as well as benign breast and colon lesions (approximately 70% of requests
have been obtained), and collections for other cancers are ongoing. Breast and ovarian cancer tissues have
been utilized for gene expression, and tissue microarrays are used extensively for immunohistochemistry. Pre-
diagnostic mammograms have been collected for breast cancer cases and controls. Substantial proportions of
the cohort have GWAS and metabolomic data from nested case-control analyses. This cohort has been highly
productive; over 400 papers have been published during the last five years, and the rate of publication is
increasingly rapidly. With our active resource sharing component, we have participated in 32 consortia as a
member of the NCI Cohort Consortium, one of the few cohorts contributing substantial data on premenopausal
women and the largest contributor of premenopausal breast cancers. We also have active data sharing
collaborations with many individual external investigators. These external collaborations and consortia have
resulted in more than 75 cancer publications during the current funding period. In the current proposal, we aim
to continue cohort follow-up and maintain these unique resources. We will continue collecting blood and urine
samples from women with breast cancer who also provided pre-diagnostic samples, tumor tissue for incident
cancers, and pre-diagnostic pre- and postmenopausal mammograms. We propose to conduct a long-term (2-3
year) reproducibility analysis for genetic sequencing of gut microbiome samples. Finally, we will enhance our
data management and analytic tools to maximize efficiency and data sharing."

Approximately 1 in 500 males in the United States are affected by X-Linked Intellectual Disability (XLID). Our
laboratory has previously characterized several mutations in the O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) gene that are
causal for a syndromal form of XLID and have recently discovered three novel missense mutations in the catalytic
domain with clinical collaborators. OGT is an essential glycosyltransferase that is solely responsible for the
addition of the post-translational modification beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) onto serines and threonines
of target nuclear and cytosolic proteins. OGT and O-GlcNAc have been implicated in a variety of cellular
processes and diseases including neurodevelopment, transcriptional regulation, and XLID. Previous work by our
lab biochemically characterized mutations in the Tetratricopeptide Repeat (TPR) domain of OGT, but a unifying
downstream effect on transcription regulation responsible for the XLID phenotype has yet to be elucidated. Given
both catalytic domain and TPR domain mutations are causal for XLID, our hypothesis is that both the novel
catalytic domain variants and previously described TPR domain variants cause a dysregulation of gene
expression by an inability to fully glycosylate key target proteins involved in transcriptional regulation due to a
loss of OGT targeting (TPR domain) or reduction in OGT catalytic efficiency (catalytic domain). This hypothesis
is supported by data demonstrating that TPR domain variants have altered transcription compared to wildtype
and that catalytic domain variants can be causal for XLID. To test our hypothesis, we will biochemically
characterize the novel catalytic domain variants, and we will determine changes to gene expression for both
catalytic domain variants and previously characterized TPR domain variants. Our lab is uniquely poised to
address this hypothesis due to our expertise in O-GlcNAc biology, previous work with XLID variants, and our
possession of Cas9-engineered male human embryonic stem cells expressing TPR domain variants of OGT. In
aim 1, we will use in vitro assays and whole cell assays to determine changes in the biochemical characteristics
of the novel catalytic domain variants including thermal stability, kinetic parameters, and impact on global O-
GlcNAc levels when expressed in cellulo. In aim 2, we will determine changes in gene expression between all
characterized variants as we differentiate CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human embryonic stem cells to neural
precursor cells. When combined with ChIP-Seq data, we can evaluate the impact of OGT variants on regulation
of gene expression. Based on preliminary data, we will also investigate Tet2 and HCF1 as potential OGT
interactors/substrates to explain the dysregulation of gene expression. These approaches will help elucidate how
variants deficient in different functions result in the same XLID neurodevelopmental phenotype in the patient.
Furthermore, this research will take place at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of
Georgia under the direction of Dr. Lance Wells, that will provide the trainee an excellent environment to learn
general and specialized biochemical skills as well as critical thinking skills under exemplary mentorship."
10816428,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with medical complexity (CMC), or those with multiple chronic conditions, progressive conditions, or
technology dependence, are at high risk for post-hospitalization morbidity. Despite representing 1% of children
in the US, CMC account for 1/3 of pediatric hospital expenditures; 30-day readmission rates are ~20%. Research
on post-discharge morbidity (e.g., adverse drug events, infections, unanticipated visits) has focused on adults.
Few studies have assessed strategies to reduce post-discharge morbidity in CMC. Such strategies must account
for 1) factors distinct to children (e.g., liquid medications, recognizing symptoms in children who cannot express
what is wrong) and 2) specific needs of CMC (e.g., medical equipment, knowing which of many providers to
contact, managing multiple chronic medications, complex family/household dynamics). Inadequate provider-
parent communication and low parent health literacy contribute to poor comprehension of and adherence to
discharge instructions, increasing risk for post-discharge morbidity. Despite recommendations from multiple
national organizations for evidence-based, health literacy-informed interventions to improve communication
processes, to date, a health literacy-informed approach to address post-hospitalization morbidity for CMC has
not been used while also incorporating principals of family dynamics.
The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Glick’s goal of becoming an independent investigator
with the aim of improving 1) parent comprehension of/adherence to discharge instructions and 2) post-discharge
outcomes for CMC. This goal will be achieved through training from an expert multidisciplinary mentorship team
and formal coursework. He will gain advanced skills in 1) qualitative/mixed method research, 2) family dynamics,
3) user-centered design, and 4) implementation science/design and evaluation of complex interventions. Dr.
Glick will accomplish his goals at NYU School of Medicine through the following 3 aims:
In Aim 1, Dr. Glick will use qualitative methods to examine barriers/facilitators for a) parents in comprehension
of/adherence to discharge instructions and b) pediatricians in providing optimal discharge education for CMC.
In Aim 2, Dr. Glick will use Aim 1 findings, multiple rounds of usability testing, multi-disciplinary workgroups, a
national sample of discharge instructions for CMC, and an existing tool designed to improve parent adherence
to discharge instructions for common pediatric diagnoses to inform the design of his new tool for CMC.
In Aim 3, Dr. Glick will utilize a randomized controlled trial to examine this tool’s efficacy in improving parent
comprehension of and adherence to discharge instructions and reducing post-hospitalization morbidity for CMC.
Successful completion of this project will lead to an R01 application to test the efficacy of the intervention, now
linked to the electronic health record, in improving parent comprehension of/adherence to discharge plans and
reducing post-hospitalization morbidity for CMC."

This is a request for a 5-year renewal of grant R13DA013192 to continue to support travel awards for
trainees and early career researchers to attend annual meetings of the College on Problems of Drug
Dependence (CPDD). CPDD is the oldest scientific society dedicated to substance use research. As
the only annual national or international meeting that brings together researchers studying all aspects
and approaches to the problems of substance use, CPDD’s conference provides a particularly
enriching experience for trainees and early career researchers in the field. The meeting attracts basic
and clinical researchers from throughout the United States and about 40 countries, at all career stages
from predoctoral students through senior investigators, as well as representatives from government and
industry. It includes scientists, physicians, nurses, clinical psychologists, administrators, policy makers,
journalists and others working on or interested in substance use research. Our meetings are a forum for
researchers from a broad range of disciplines (e.g., medicinal chemistry, molecular biology,
pharmacology, genetics, neuroimaging, psychology, sociology, addiction medicine, public health,
epidemiology) to share their recent findings, network and learn from one another in formal and informal
exchanges. We expect 1000-1300 attendees at each of our future meetings supported by this
competing renewal. In the next funding period, we propose to continue to support travel awards for
trainees and early career researchers to attend the CPDD annual meetings. Topics addressed at the
meeting change with emerging concerns and cutting-edge research in the field, and, each year,
sessions highly relevant to NIDA's major program areas (e.g., epidemiology, prevention, health
services, medications development, neuroscience, behavior, HIV/AIDS and health disparities) are
included. Presentations span the full range of drugs of abuse, including opioids, stimulants, sedatives,
cannabis, hallucinogens, nicotine and alcohol. The conference includes awards lectures and forums on
policy, animal and human research, industry/academia/government collaboration and media outreach,
as well as activities directed towards trainees, early career researchers, underrepresented minorities
and international scientists. We expect our annual meetings to accelerate innovation in substance use
research through the translational nature of our content and through the collaborations that are built
between attendees across the disciplines represented at the meeting. We also expect findings
presented at the meeting to reach a broader audience due to our media outreach activities and newly
developed virtual offerings, which can significantly improve prevention and treatment of substance use
disorders and inform policy as it relates to substance use."
10763817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 CD8 T cell responses to viral infections and tumors contribute significantly to the immune responses that
dictate the clinical outcomes of such pathologies. The functional integrity of CD8 T cell responses depends on
the characteristic properties of CD8 effector (Teff) and memory (Tmem) populations. However, during chronic
viral infections and cancer, antigen persistence without clearance precludes effective Teff and Tmem
development, instead biasing CD8 T cell differentiation towards an epigenetically distinct “exhausted” lineage
(Tex). Tex exhibit progressive dysfunction and loss of effector properties, proliferation capacity, and memory
potential, as well as a sustained increase in co-expression of PD1 and multiple other inhibitory receptors (IRs).
Interrogating the fundamental mechanisms that initiate and maintain the Tex epigenetic state is of central
importance to understanding Tex biology and identifying strategies to selectively target or modulate Tex.
However, the field generally lacks a detailed mechanistic understanding of Tex-specific epigenetic processes. In
models of exhaustion during chronic infection and of dysfunctional tumor-specific T cells, the transcription factor
TOX is essential for the initiation of Tex development, repressing terminal Teff differentiation and potentiating
epigenetic commitment to the Tex lineage. This proposal seeks to identify and interrogate the mechanistic details
of Tex regulation by TOX that would be required to begin developing immunotherapy approaches to
epigenetically reprogram Tex and improve immunotherapy clinical outcomes.
The molecular transactions TOX employs to exert its effects remain largely unknown. Understanding the details
of TOX activity remains limited by a lack of functional characterization of its N- and C-terminal domains (“NTD”
and “CTD”) in relation to its HMG-box DNA binding domain. My preliminary data demonstrate in vitro that loss of
either the TOX NTD or CTD is sufficient to abrogate the increase in surface PD1 expression that is
characteristically driven by full-length (“FL”) TOX, suggesting important, as yet unknown roles for these domains.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that distinct features of TOX activity are attributable to its N-
vs. C-terminal domains and that NTD- or CTD-specific perturbations will enable selective modulation of
Tex responses to chronic viral infection. This proposal tests this hypothesis by interrogating features of TOX’s
interactions and domain-level function at the Pdcd1 locus (encoding PD1), by defining the extent to which the
NTD and CTD exhibit global differences in their Tex-specific roles, by defining how the NTD and CTD program
the Tex epigenetic state, and by determining which NTD- and CTD-mediated protein interactions TOX uses to
regulate Tex transcription. This proposal will thus advance fundamental knowledge of how the molecular
processes regulating exhaustion may be manipulated to improve CD8 T cell responses during chronic viral
infections and cancer."
10832470,"Families’ engagement in NICU care facilitates holding, skin-to-skin care, and human milk
feeding, which improve neonatal survival and long-term infant development. However, there are
many disproportionate structural barriers faced by marginalized families when visiting the NICU.
Few studies have characterized these structural barriers and evaluated how they affect infant
and parental disparities and outcomes. In this project, Dr. MK Quinn, hypothesizes that parents
of children in the NICU from marginalized backgrounds are less likely to have access to paid
family leave, childcare, transportation, and may encounter language barriers, and that this
contributes racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in preterm infant health outcomes.
This hypothesis will be addressed with two specific aims. First, to understand the barriers that
families face to engaging in the care of their preterm infants in mixed methods study Dr. Quinn
will identify barriers through key informant interviews of low-income families with preterm infants
in the NICU. This rich qualitative data of parents’ experiences will inform the development of
evidenced based theory of what is driving disparities in family visitation and engagement. This
will be followed by a multicenter survey of parents with preterm infants in the NICU, in order to
first understand the prevalence of these barriers and investigate how these barriers are
experienced by marginalized groups. Second, Dr. Quinn will conduct an observational study of
the health effects of the most salient barrier to care, paid family leave. For this analysis she will
investigate how the implementation of California’s paid family leave policy contributed to racial
and socioeconomic disparities in preterm infant care and outcomes.
The results of this study will provide the groundwork for designing policy interventions to ensure
families can engage in their preterm infant’s care, and ultimately, reduce inequities and improve
preterm health outcomes. The sponsor for this research is Dr. Henry Lee, a neonatologist with
expertise in health services research. The cosponsor, Dr. Jochen Profit, is a neonatologist with
expertise in neonatal inequities. The advisory team includes Dr. Maya Rossin-Slater, an
economist with expertise in family leave policy, Dr. Suzan Carmichael, an epidemiologist with
expertise in perinatal health inequities, and Dr. Christine Morton, a sociologist with expertise in
perinatal qualitative research. The research in this study in concert her training plan will provide
Dr. Quinn a foundation in the study of neonatal health inequities and prepare her for a career
continuing this research as an independent investigator."

The Nonhuman Primate Reagent Resource (NHPRR) has 21 years of continuous operation providing
specialized reagents to enable and enhance research with nonhuman primate (NHP) models of human
disease. This application describes our next five-year plan to develop and distribute these essential NHP-
tailored reagents.
NHPs serve a crucial role in translational research, providing animal models for exploring the
pathogenesis of infectious and noninfectious diseases, and for testing biological therapies and vaccines.
Antibodies and biological reagents that target specific immune cells and biomarkers can be essential
tools in determining disease mechanisms. Additionally, immunomodulators that can be studied in vivo
serve as proof-of-concept for new therapies. While these crucial research tools are available for small
animal and human studies, substantial gaps exist for validated NHP research reagents. To overcome
this scarcity, for the past 21 years, the NHPRR has fulfilled critical needs within the scientific community
by developing, manufacturing and distributing NHP-specific reagents for in vitro diagnostics and for in
vivo use. Utilization of this resource has grown dramatically since this program’s inception. During the
last five years (2015-2019), we fulfilled 2,821 reagent requests for 320 investigators and distributed
~2,500 grams of recombinant antibodies for administration to NHPs.
By continuously availing ourselves of future scientific advances and technological improvements in
antibody development, engineering, expression and vectoring, we will keep supporting the scientific
community utilizing NHP models across all scientific disciplines."

The overall incidence of thyroid cancer in 2016 was estimated by the National Cancer Institute to be 64,300.
Patients who present with poorly differentiated thyroid cancers frequently are refractory to standard treatment
regimens and have a much worse prognosis. The median overall survival in this patient population is less than
a year. Undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid cancers are typically not amenable to surgery and are highly
resistant to RAI and virtually all other therapies. We therefore developed a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T
cell therapy targeting intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (labeled as AIC100) to treat this aggressive
type of thyroid cancer. While a variety of cells in the body normally express low, basal levels of ICAM-1, many
human cancers have upregulated levels of expression. In particular, both refractory poorly differentiated and
anaplastic thyroid cancers have greatly increased expression of ICAM-1. The key aspect of our CAR T cell
technology is its ability to selectively kill tumors with over-expressed ICAM-1 while sparing normal cells with
basal levels of ICAM-1 expression. To assess in vivo distribution of CAR T cells in both targeted tumors as well
as non-target tissues, we have introduced the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) to follow CAR T cells over time
using the clinically approved radiolabeled tracer 68Galium-DOTATATE (Netspot). In the planned phase I study,
the primary objective is to assess the safety and determine the recommended dose of AIC100 for phase II
study in patients with relapsed/refractory poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and in patients with anaplastic
thyroid cancer. The secondary aims are to evaluate the efficacy of AIC100 in patients using PET/CT and
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria, evaluate the feasibility of CAR T cell imaging
by DOTATATE, determine if overall tumor response correlates with T cell distribution in tumor sites as
measured by DOTATATE and other exploratory biomarkers, and to examine pre-infusion CAR T
characteristics as a predictor of clinical response. Our investigational new drug (IND) application to open phase
I study of AIC100 against advanced thyroid cancers is now approved by FDA in October 2019, and patient
enrollment will commence in early 2020. As the cost for CAR T manufacturing and non-standard of care clinical
costs will be sponsored by our industry collaborator (AffyImmune Therapeutics, Inc.), the major goals of this
grant application are to assess the kinetics of T cell distribution by PET/CT, and determine the emergence of
high clonality T cells and associated cellular and gene expression signatures with respect to clinical response,
toxicity, and survival; to correlate intrinsic CAR T fitness for survival and clonal expansion with clinical
response; to optimize T cell manufacturing and next-generation CAR designs to improve the fitness of CAR T
cells toward more effective CAR T therapies against solid cancers."
10794910,"Project Summary
  Significance. The human brain has a dedicated neural system for processing other humans. However relatively
  little is known about the basic mechanisms of this processing. Prior research has found that live human face
  viewing results in more activity in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) than does viewing a face simulation
  like a robot face. This suggests that live faces have characteristics that transcend appearance, motion, co-
  presence, and embodiment which give them access to sociocognitive systems that face simulations cannot
  access. Research question. What are the neural mechanisms of this access and how do they relate to stimulus
 acquisition? Further, how might these mechanisms contribute to dysfunction in psychiatric illnesses like
  schizophrenia? Addressing these gaps in the literature requires skills in: (1) multimodal data acquisition; (2)
  advanced analytics; and (3) experimental design for clinical populations. To pursue these questions long-term
 by becoming an independent researcher, I propose a two-phase training plan. In Aim 1, I will supplement existing
 skills for multimodal experimental design, acquisition, and preprocessing with intermediate multimodal analytics,
 advanced programming, dataset management, and professionalization. Approach. I will do this with a study on
 neurotypical neural processing during live human face viewing with robot face viewing as control and will acquire
 simultaneous functional Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography (EEG), eye-tracking,
 and pupillometry. I will then apply eye-behavior-guided time frequency decomposition of EGG data, cross-
 frequency phase-amplitude coupling, and fNIRS-constrained EEG source localization. Hypotheses. Visual
 sensing is an active component of the neural processing of live faces. If true, then we hypothesize that eye
 movements and pupil size during live face viewing will be greater due to increased attention and arousal and
 greater acquisition of meaningful information from a live face. These differences are hypothesized to correspond
 to increased power in gamma (30-100hz)—reflecting configural processing—and theta (4-8hz)—reflecting
 perceptual binding. These frequencies are hypothesized to be coupled to each other—reflecting information
 transfer from local to global processing—and to localize to regions identified with fNIRS contrasts of live face
 and robot face viewing. This will identify the temporal and spatial features of the social processing network.
 Preliminary Results. Participants show greater pupil size and differences in dwell time during live face viewing.
 Right-TPJ-localized theta band power is greater during live face than robot face viewing. Aim 2, I will complete
 post-doctoral training on experimental design for those with schizophrenia and on advanced computational
 analytics like factor analysis and predictive coding. I will do this through research on live face viewing paradigms,
 such as emotional expression or direct gaze perception, during multimodal data acquisition with a population of
 patients and non-patients. This training will give me the skills necessary for long term research independence
 to explore the role of social neurocognitive function and dysfunction in health and psychiatric illness."
10823235,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Infections by Salmonella present a constant threat to human health in our country and throughout the world.
Yet, our progress toward controlling salmonellosis has been largely fruitless; antibiotics are rarely warranted,
and, when used, frequently fail due to resistant strains. To control this important foodborne pathogen, it is
essential to understand the means by which it colonizes and induces disease. Chemical signals of the
intestine, including those produced by both the animal host and the microbiota, can repress Salmonella
virulence by reducing its ability to invade the intestinal epithelium. We propose that this signaling defines the
fine balance between virulence and growth of the pathogen. We have found that a novel class of chemicals
produced by species of the Gammaproteobacteria, termed diffusible signal factors (DSFs), potently represses
invasion. DSFs are quorum-sensing molecules that we have found to exist in the large intestine of mice in
sufficient concentration to inhibit Salmonella invasion. They therefore represent both a novel instance of inter-
species signaling and a means by which Salmonella disease and carriage is modulated by its biological
environment. The long-term goal of this work is to identify practical means to inhibit Salmonella invasion in
humans and thus to reduce clinical and sub-clinical salmonellosis. Our objectives are to understand how
invasion-inhibiting compounds function, and to investigate their efficacy in preventing disease. Our central
hypothesis is that the resident microbiota of the large intestine produce chemical signals that repress
Salmonella invasion, and that these signals thus dictate the balance between virulence and growth. We aim to
test the specific hypotheses that: 1) Intestinal chemical signals (including both DSFs and other microbiota-
derived compounds) modulate Salmonella virulence by controlling the proportion of the pathogen population
capable of invasion to dictate disease and carriage; 2) Signaling molecules of varying structures bind within a
single binding pocket of AraC-type invasion regulators, but utilizing different binding moieties, thus dictating
activity and competition among these signals, and; 3) Signals repressive for invasion can be produced in
animals using recombinant bacteria to reduce both clinical signs of salmonellosis and intestinal colonization by
this pathogen. The work described here is significant and innovative as it has potential to identify a novel
means of pathogen control that does not rely upon antibiotics but instead targets attributes essential to
colonization and virulence."
10819147,"The ADF/cofilin family of proteins play a critical role in actin filament turnover essential to all forms of
eukaryotic cell motility. Despite a vast literature on signaling pathways controlling cofilin activity, assessing the
function of this important protein in living cells has been hampered by lack of real time assays of cofilin
function. Using a novel real time assay for assessing cofilin activity and actin dynamics simultaneously by
quantitative fluorescent speckle microscopy (qFSM), we have discovered that mechanical stress imposed on
treadmilling actin networks increases cofilin activity with dramatic effects on actin turnover rates that depend on
the level of stress. Low stress levels are associated with increases in actin turnover and treadmilling rates that
are associated with chemotropic growth; in contrast, stress levels above a critical threshold lead to catastrophic
decreases in actin network density resulting in neurite retraction. We have been studying mechanical effects
on cofilin activity in the context of serotonin (5-HT) evoked neurite growth responses mediated by classical
G(q) subtype GPCRs, which activate phospholipase C to generate IP3 and DAG signals. 5-HT evokes IP3
dependent Ca release from intracellular stores and cofilin activation by a Ca→calcineurin signaling cascade.
We now have evidence that DAG production results in PKC dependent increases in non-muscle myosin II
activity. This in turn generates local network stress and mechano-catalytic activation of cofilin resulting in local
alteration of F-actin structure and network turnover rates. Effects on actin structure also depend on the level of
PKC activation. PKC has other known roles including regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics in growth cones
and since MTs are the transport substrate for ER/Ca stores, MT dynamics regulate the functional topography
of IP3 dependent Ca release involved in 5-HT dependent growth. PKC can also potentiate integrin based cell
adhesion and thereby affect traction forces involved in neuronal growth. We propose to investigate PKC as a
signaling node that coordinates: 1) myosin II contractility, 2) actin turnover via cofilin mechano-catalysis, 3) Ca
release topography via regulation of microtubule/ER dynamics, and 4) ultimately, traction force production
during axon growth. These studies will provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how cofilin enables
functional crosstalk between actin dynamics and myosin II contractility during chemotropic growth responses.
The results will have interesting implications regarding the key role PKC plays in neuronal growth and
neurodegenerative disease."
10815820,"Animals perceive optic flow and use it to guide a range of navigational behaviors, such as stabilizing body
trajectories and eye movements. In this project, we propose to dissect how different visual cues are combined
to guide stabilizing behaviors, and how these cues serve as evidence for and against an animal’s self-motion.
We will investigate these computations in the fruit fly Drosophila, which allows us to use powerful genetic tools
to define the roles of individual neurons in neural computations. With these tools, our research will (a)
characterize the algorithms that combine types of visual evidence, (b) identify the circuits that encode and
combine these cues, and (c) determine how neurons perform these computations. This work is significant for
two reasons. First, our studies will examine how the fly integrates visual evidence both for and against its own
self-motion. This form of counterevidence integration cannot be accounted for by current models of optic flow
detection. Thus, this project will establish new approaches to studying how animals estimate their own self-motion. Second, the types of visual evidence for and against self-motion are constrained by the geometry of
the visual world. Because of this common geometry and parallels in visual processing between flies and
mammals, it is likely that mammalian visual systems make use of algorithms similar to those we will find in the
fly. Thus, analysis in the compact fly brain will uncover principles for understanding these computations in the
brains of larger animals. In our research, we will combine genetic tools and behavioral measurements to
investigate three questions: How do different visual cues interact in stabilizing the fly’s heading? What circuitry
is required for the different types of cues? And how do the circuits process and integrate these cues to
generate behavior? These questions lead to the three aims of our research. Aim 1 characterizes the algorithm
that integrates evidence for and against the fly’s self-motion and guides its turning behavior. Behavioral
measurements with targeted visual stimuli will constrain or rule out potential models. Aim 2 identifies neurons
required to integrate visual counterevidence into turning behavior. We will use genetic tools to silence specific
neurons in the visual system in order to identify neurons required for this computation. Aim 3 measures
functional response properties of visual neurons in the circuits that encode and integrate these visual cues. We
will use measurements of neuron responses to stimuli to test hypotheses for how these neurons combine
signals to generate the observed motion signals and behaviors. On completion, these studies will result in a
detailed understanding of the algorithms and neural mechanisms that integrate different visual cues to stabilize
heading in flies. This will provide a template for understanding how visual evidence is combined to estimate
self-motion in other animals as well."
10819195,"SUMMARY
Abnormalities in cerebellar development, especially pathology and dysfunction of Purkinje cells, have
been implicated in a wide variety of neurodevelopmental diseases, including ataxia, autism spectrum
disorder, schizophrenia, and language impairment. Being one of the earliest-born cerebellar cell groups,
Purkinje cells are believed instrumental in the development, function, and pathogenesis of the cerebellum.
Evidence suggests the existence of Purkinje cell subtypes with distinct molecular features. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the diversification of Purkinje cells remain poorly understood.
Consequently, we lack an entry to assess the role of individual Purkinje cell subtypes. Through single-cell
RNA and chromatin accessibility analyses, we uncovered at least nine molecularly distinct subtypes of
Purkinje cells in the developing mouse cerebellum. These Purkinje cell subtypes contribute to different
compartments in the developing cerebellum. Remarkably, the Purkinje cell subtypes display a
characteristic combinatorial expression of Foxp1, Foxp2, and Foxp4, which belong to a subgroup of the
forkhead-box transcription factor family. Mutations of human FOXP1 or FOXP2 are linked to speech
disorders, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability, indicating that these proteins coordinate the
development of the neural circuits related to cognitive diseases. In vitro evidence shows that FoxP
proteins form dimers or oligomers with variable transcriptional targets and actives depending on the
binding partner. We hypothesize that Foxp1/2/4 form combinatorial “FoxP codes” to specify distinct
Purkinje cell subtypes, which in turn control the morphogenesis of the cerebellum. Aim 1 will combine
conventional expression analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and volume imaging to determine the
development of PC subtypes in relation to the morphogenesis of the cerebellum. Aim 2 will
delete Foxp1/2/4, individually and in combinations, from the mouse cerebellum. We will use histology,
single-cell RNA-seq, and behavioral studies to evaluate the impacts of single and
compound Foxp1/2/4 mutations on cerebellar development and behavioral function. Aim 3 will use a multi-
omic approach to study the molecular mechanism by which combinatorial FoxP genes regulate the
transcription program for Purkinje cell differentiation. At the completion of this project, we expect to have
identified the individual and combinatorial roles of Foxp1/2/4 in cerebellar development. This study will
have a significant positive impact, not only on the basic knowledge of cerebellar development but also on
the understanding of the molecular basis of the vast number of unexplored cerebellum-related diseases."

We propose developing a systems-biology approach to understand interactions between tumor and immune
cells and their clinical implications. Our work will focus on medulloblastoma, a malignant pediatric brain tumor
in which our team has extensive expertise. We and others have shown that medulloblastoma tumors are sites
of immune activity despite the blood-brain barrier. However, the clinical consequences of these immune cells
are unclear and there is little information that might guide development of therapeutics that modulate these
immune cells.
Our innovative strategy combines single-cell methods, including single-cell proteomics, with a sophisticated
computational analysis. In Aim 1, we map the landscape of tumor-immune interactions using sequencing and
imaging methods on human samples. Aim 2 builds a causal model of the molecular interactions that govern
interactions among cell types in medulloblastoma, determines the clinical correlates of these cells, and
identifies potential therapeutic targets. Aim 3 maps the tumor-immune environment in well-validated mouse
models of the disease, and builds computational models for mice parallel to those for humans. Hypotheses
from Aim 2 that are likely to translate well to the mouse models are then tested for their effects on tumor
growth and survival. The mouse results are used to update the computational models and refine the
therapeutic strategies. We expect that successful completion of this project will have a substantial impact on
medulloblastoma therapeutics. Further, the methods we develop will catalyze research of interactions between
immune cells and many other tumor types beyond medulloblastoma."

We offer a comprehensive 2-year multidisciplinary training program in cardiovascular epidemiology (CVE) for
MDs and PhDs to pursue an academic and scientific research career addressing contemporary training needs
of the specialty.
The program goals are: 1. to graduate five postdoctoral scholars every two years in three CVE research
tracks: clinical translational epidemiology, statistical genetics-genomics, and bioinformatics-computational
biology, among whom at least 20% underrepresented group (URG) members and 50% women are included;
and 2. to provide career and professional developmental support for scholars to transition to independence,
faculty status or a first job in academe or industry.
To achieve these goals, we offer the following specific aims:
(1) Provide broad rigorous multidisciplinary competency-based learner-centered education in approaches to
CVE research. We have developed a cross-track curriculum intended to assure that our scholars develop
foundational and functional skills to conduct CVE research successfully, including skills in scientific
communication (writing scientific manuscripts and grants, oral presentations), and research design and
management. We train scholars in the responsible conduct of research with rigor and reproducibility, team
science, leadership and self-management. Our training program offers requisite coursework (customized to
scholars' past training levels and career goals), attendance at a broad range of seminars and workshops,
interactions with outstanding faculty mentors with expertise in translational research, participation in programs
aimed at multidisciplinary collaborations, and customized internships (including in industry). Team-based
learning approaches include participation of scholars in journal clubs, “Work-in-Progress” sessions, discussion
forums, and a scholar exchange program;
(2) Feature carefully planned and personalized mentored research projects for each scholar — under the
direction of an established NIH- or NSF-funded investigator with extensive expertise in one of the three training
tracks — resulting in scholarship, presentation at national meetings, and peer-reviewed publications. Our
program leverages extensive epidemiological cohort databases that scholars can easily access;
(3) Impart authentic robust career mentorship using an individualized development plan to ensure transition to
a career development award and/or initial job placement in academe or industry;

Transgender children and adolescents are a poorly understood and a distinctly understudied population in the
United States. The limited available data suggest that youth with gender dysphoria are at increased risk for
negative mental and medical health outcomes including anxiety, depression, HIV acquisition, suicide, and
substance use compared to their peers. Therefore, medical intervention is aimed at alleviating gender dysphoria
and ameliorating potential negative outcomes. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine called for research to understand
and improve the lives of gender minority populations. In 2015, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles/USC, Boston
Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Benioff Children’s Hospitals/UCSF and Lurie Children’s Hospital of
Chicago/Northwestern University were awarded NIH grant R01HD082554 to develop and implement a
multidisciplinary, prospective, observational study: The Impact of Early Medical Treatment in Transgender Youth
(TYC). The original aims were to examine physiological and psychosocial effects of medical intervention for
transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth with gender dysphoria observed for 24-months. To date, TYC has
successfully recruited beyond its targeted baseline sample in two cohorts: (i) 95 youth initiating pubertal
suppression with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) along with one parent/guardian (n=95), as
well as (ii) 316 youth initiating gender-affirming hormone (GAH) therapy (testosterone or estrogen). Early results
have demonstrated a positive trend regarding mental health response to gender affirming interventions. The
primary objective of this observational, longitudinal, multicenter renewal study is to evaluate the longer-term
physiological and psychological impact of existing medical treatment protocols initiated in adolescence on youth
with gender dysphoria for up to an additional 4 years. A second objective is to enhance the diversity and size of
existing cohorts by enrolling additional youth of color (YOC) into both cohorts (n=89) and enroll additional
assigned males at birth specifically into the GAH cohort (n=110). The final objective is to add measurements of
psychosocial variables required to answer new questions posed in this renewal application. A key feature of the
renewal period is that most individuals in the original GnRHa cohort will be starting GAH treatment. By examining
outcomes of TGD youth who initiated GAH treatment with and without histories of puberty suppression, TYC will
be well positioned to examine key questions about the sequencing of puberty suppression and GAH treatment
on health outcomes. Continuing our current research is imperative to expand the scant evidence-base currently
guiding the clinical care of TGD youth and thus, is of considerable public health significance. Results from this
study have the potential to significantly impact services provided to TGD youth in the U.S. by making available
rigorous scientific evidence outlining the longer-term impact and safety of early treatments based on pubertal
development stage."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive
decline and dementia. Genome-wide association studies have identified novel AD susceptibility loci. Interestingly
the associated genes at several of these loci implicate the immune system in late-onset AD, specifically the
innate immune system. Many recent lines of evidence suggest that the immune system plays a key role in AD
initiation and progression, but the actual mechanistic dysfunction of the immune system in this
neurodegenerative disease remains unknown. Genetic studies and pathology hint that the immune system’s
ability to mount a productive response has been lost in AD with detrimental consequences. Post-mortem
pathology of individuals with AD reveals an infiltration of T cells in the hippocampus, a region expected to be
immune privileged, leading to speculation that AD might have an infectious component to its etiology or
progression. In parallel, the pathogen hypothesis has garnered more support for a possible pathogenic etiology
of AD. We propose to leverage our understanding of the immune system to determine if the immune response
to the neuroinvasive pathogen human simplex virus (HSV)-1 is modulated by AD genetic associations, leading
to increased risk for AD. We will take a comprehensive approach using cutting-edge tools to explore this
hypothesis in AD. Combining genetics, human immunology, transcriptomics, virology, in vitro models,
computational biology and epidemiology, we will dissect the interaction between HSV-1 infections and AD
genetics. For this application, we propose a multifaceted approach using cutting-edge technology to: 1) identify
the microglia response to HSV-1 infection based on each individual’s genetic background; 2) examine how these
microglia function as antigen-presenting cells to T cells, a key cell type in resolving active infections; and 3)
determine the interaction of HSV-1 and AD genetics in two well-establish cohorts and one anti-viral clinical trial
in AD."
10829800,"ABSTRACT
Dedicated pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies are performed in healthy adult volunteers
during drug development. However, dedicated PK DDI studies are rarely performed in infants due to ethical and
logistical reasons. This results in the extrapolation of adult drug dosing recommendations that account for the
DDI potential to infants despite known age-induced physiological changes that can alter PK and affect the DDI
magnitude in infants. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are an ideal tool to characterize PK
DDIs in infants because they can account for the DDI mechanism and physiological age-induced changes that
affect the DDI magnitude early in life. This proposal will evaluate a systematic approach to PK DDI evaluation in
infants using PBPK modeling and real-world data to accelerate the availability of age-appropriate drug dosing
recommendations in light of the DDI potential. We will characterize DDIs involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
3A substrates midazolam and fentanyl, and the CYP2C9/2C19 substrate phenobarbital, when co-administered
with drugs that inhibit their metabolism. We will validate the PBPK model DDI predictions using real-world data
collected from infants receiving the drug combinations per standard of care. The PBPK models will then guide
drug dosing that accounts for differences in DDI magnitude with age. Once our systematic approach to PBPK
model informed DDI evaluation in infants is established, it can be applied to characterize other PK DDIs and
accelerate the availability of drug dosing recommendations for infants in light of the DDI potential."

Candidate: Eric Tuday, MD, PhD is an assistant professor with a dual appointment to the Division of
Cardiology at the University of Utah and the Translational Physiology Laboratory at Salt Lake City VA. Dr.
Tuday's research is focused on the impact of miR-181b expression on the development of age-related large
artery stiffness. Dr. Tuday's long-term goal is to independently direct an extramurally funded laboratory with
research focused on the vascular biology of aging and addressing age-related vascular diseases.
Career Development: This award will support Dr. Tuday's career development by building on his existing
training in cardiovascular physiology. Specifically, Dr. Tuday will receive extensive training in the planning and
execution of studies assessing whole vessel and individual smooth muscle health in rodents. The career
development plan outlines a coordinated effort to train the candidate in areas including: vascular biology of
aging; assessment of molecular pathways pertinent to pathologic states, animal genetic models, and state of
the art cellular interrogation methods; didactic course work designed to facilitate a better understanding of
fundamentals of therapeutic product development, animal research, and biostatistics; and, regular attendance
at vascular aging, genetics, and molecular biology conferences; and lastly exposure to teaching.
Environment: The University of Utah is an ideal environment for Dr. Tuday's career development. This
environment provides all the resources needed to complete the proposed studies during this K08 proposal.
The University of Utah also provides a rich environment for formal and informal training in career development.
Research: The central hypothesis of this research project is that age-related reductions in microRNA-181b
expression levels results in the deregulation of pro-inflammatory pathways that ultimately result in increased
large artery stiffness. It is known that microRNA-181b is beneficial in terms of vascular health and that levels
decrease with age; we seek to understand these mechanisms. While many of the mechanisms of microRNA-
181b have been described, we contend that there are unstudied pathways influenced by microRNA-181b of
significance as they relate to vascular health, specifically to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Finally, we
hypothesize that chronic, VSMC specific, microRNA-181b overexpression can prevent the age-associated
increases in large artery stiffness that ultimately preserve cardiovascular health."

10849685,"Project Summary
 The goal of this proposal is to design new Ti-catalyzed oxidation reactions to modularly assemble pyrazole
derivatives and difunctionalize alkynes. The rationale for developing Ti catalysis is that Ti is earth-abundant and
generally nontoxic, which obviates the need for efficient catalyst removal and recovery in fine chemical synthesis.
Early transition metals can access different structures and elementary reaction steps than late transition metals,
resulting in bond forming strategies that are complementary or orthogonal to existing technology.
 First, the proposed research concerns developing new dual catalytic strategies for the [2+2+1] synthesis of
pyrazoles. Using preliminary data gained in our laboratory on stoichiometric oxidation-induced N-N reductive
elimination reactions, we will explore single-electron catalytic and photocatalytic strategies for oxidant turnover.
Development of a catalytic strategy for electronegative bond couplings like N-N coupling will ultimately lead to
mild and general dual catalyst systems for the rapid, modular construction of high-value bioactive pyrazoles, and
also open avenues for advancing other challenging bond coupling reactions in catalysis.
 Further, we will design selective alkyne carboamination reactions, building off of preliminary results into this
reaction class. Alkyne carboamination reactions can lead to iminocyclopropanes and unsaturated imines, each
of which are valuable heterocycle building blocks. Our strategy for selective reaction design will be to use ISPCA,
a new statistical analysis method we have developed that aids in determination of key control factors in a reaction.
Concurrent refinement of ISPCA along with carboamination catalysis will yield both synthetically practical
reactions, as well as a tool and roadmap for other catalysis researchers to follow in designing selective reactions.
 Finally, we will use our mechanistic insight of Ti redox catalysis to design new multicomponent alkyne
oxidation reactions. A key focus of this work will be to develop strategies that incorporate more heteroatoms into
the products, using our preliminary discoveries in dual catalysis and N-N reductive elimination. These reactions
will result in catalytic methods to rapidly produce functional-group rich carbon scaffolds.
 Relevance to public health. Nitrogen heterocycles constitute the single most prevalent class of functional
groups in FDA-approved small-molecule drugs: 59% of all unique small molecule drugs contain at least one N-
heterocycle. Pyrazoles are an important class within this group, and have broad bioactivity. Although many
reactions to form pyrazoles exist, their synthesis often relies on using potentially toxic and explosive hydrazines,
and have well-established regioselectivity limitations. A general synthesis of pyrazoles that overcomes these
limitations is an unmet challenge. By designing methods to pyrazoles, and more generally to the catalytic
formation of weak bonds like N-N bonds, synthetic chemists will have rapid and convergent access to diverse
and novel molecular architectures. These building blocks will aid in the development of new small molecule drug-
like architectures for the biomedical community."
10841672,"Stereoselective chemical reactions have transformed human medicine by providing access to chemical
tools to study biological systems and pharmaceutical drugs to treat disease. Although several methods exist for
the synthesis of biologically valuable chiral molecules, there is great potential for discovering conceptually
novel strategies in catalysis for the stereoselective synthesis of molecules not easily accessed by known
methods. We are particularly interested in developing catalytic stereoselective photochemical reactions that
are useful for the generation of biologically valuable chiral products but have been traditionally thought to be
unamenable to asymmetric catalysis. These innovative strategies will complement the current known methods
in asymmetric photochemistry. We propose to develop a general platform for enantioselective a-alkylations of
carbonyl compounds with pyridinium salts and a new approach to enantioselective C–H alkylations of imines.
 Our long-term goals for this research program include the discovery of general and robust strategies for the
catalytic conversion of simple starting materials into structurally complex and biologically active small
molecules. We also anticipate that these methods will challenge established opinions of chemical reactivity that
have been held about certain classes of photochemical reactions for years. By utilizing sustainable sources of
energy (such as low energy visible light), the new strategies in stereoselective photochemistry discovered by
our laboratory will provide an environmentally benign alternative to access medicinally relevant chiral
enantioenriched molecules that are not easily synthesized by other methods.
 In Specific Aim 1, we propose to develop a general platform for the catalytic enantioselective a-alkylation of
carbonyl compounds with pyridinium salts derived from readily available primary amines as alkylating reagents.
This specific aim is guided by the hypothesis that electron poor pyridinium salts can form ground-state charge-
transfer complexes with catalytically generated electron rich chiral enolate equivalents. These complexes can
then undergo stereoselective couplings in the presence of low energy visible light. In the long-term, we will
develop a general platform for the photochemical catalytic enantioselective a-alkylation of carbonyl compounds
with pyridinium salts based on several modes of asymmetric catalysis.
 In Specific Aim 2, we propose to develop a general platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched amines
via the photochemical C–H alkylation of acyclic imines. This specific aim is guided by the hypothesis that in the
presence of visible light, a sub-stoichiometric amount of chiral Lewis acid can furnish enantioenriched amine
products with high stereoselectivity by accelerating the coupling event between an imine substrate and various
hydrocarbon alkylating agents. In the long-term, we will develop a general approach for the photochemical
enantioselective C–H alkylation of imines with a broad range of hydrocarbon substrates through distinct modes
of activation."

 In the US, approximately 1.5M babies are admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) each
year. Continuous monitoring of these patients is essential and the ability to quickly identify critical changes in a
patients' health status is crucial to guiding daily care and therapy. While individual medical devices are helpful
in this endeavor, integrating information from multiple devices onto one display and performing real-time
analytics on this data enhances identification of the reasons for a change in patient condition and not just that a
condition has changed. Continuously recording and providing both trending and real-time analysis for real
changes in patient status can help optimize care decisions thus improving outcomes in this fragile population.
 In this grant we will build upon the success of the previously cleared Vital Sync multi-modal monitor that
captures and analyzes information from over 100 devices in the NICU to help make the information actionable.
The new device provides a continuous and retrospective view of patient condition so that care providers can
objectively evaluate the effectiveness of treatment modifications. Real time assistance with identification of
changes in patient condition helps to optimize new neuroprotective protocols. Improved review of prior patient
condition through trending analysis and event marking assists with continuity of care across shift changes. The
Phase I prototype is designed to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the tool in the NICU environment. The
phase 2 system will support additional features including reduced connectivity burden and protocol support.
Centraview 2.0 will be a platform for future modular upgrades that will enhance clinical decision support (CDS)
in any ICU environment.
Phase 1 Aim 1 – Create a prototype multimodal monitor for neonatal neurocritical care
Based on existing experience and technology, we will design and prototype a new generation bedside monitoring
system for collecting and displaying data from the key NICU medical devices at UFHealth.
Phase 1 Aim 2 – Evaluate usability of the new system in a simulated NICU
In a simulated NICU environment, we will create three neonatal patient scenarios and evaluate the system in a
usability study with 8 NICU clinicians including surveys to determine perceived value, usability, and acceptance.
Phase 2 Aim 1 – Expand connectivity, add protocol adherence, and enhance usability
Clinical feedback from a successful Phase 1 will be used to improve the functionality and usability of CentraView
2. HIE protocol support will be added to the system along with several other new features including derived
parameters and wireless data collection.
Phase 2 – Aim 2 – Evaluate the effectiveness of CentraView 2 Clinical Assistant
We will first collect baseline data for 6 months at UFHealth to measure adherence with several clinical practice
guidelines (CPG). Next, we will install and train clinicians on the use of the CentraView system and determine if
the system improves compliance with the CPGs."

This Phase STTR Phase II proposal aims to engineer and scale-up a synthetic metabolic pathway in a microbial
host to produce UDCA and related compounds. Additionally, the UDCA produced from the engineered synthetic
metabolic pathway will be used to synthesize derivatives for testing in our Alzheimer’s Disease cell and animal
models. The proposed work has high intellectual merit for the following reasons: (i) UDCA biosynthesis does
not occur in any organism whose cultivation can be scaled to meet global demand, (ii) UDCA requires a multi-
organism biosynthetic pathway (animal cholic acids converted to UDCA by the gut microbiome) that will have to
be reconstituted in a single cell, and (iii) the anticipated scale and complexity of this engineering effort (combining
more than a dozen genes from four organisms) are on the edge of what is feasible. Technical hurdles involve
the discovery of new enzymes that convert ergosterol to cholesterol (a process known to exist in brine shrimp),
achieving proper localization and enzymatic activity for fifteen recombinant gene products in yeast, and balancing
the expression levels of each gene to support high-titer production of UDCA in yeast. The combined
Metselex/University of Minnesota team will overcome these hurdles using their platform for multi-gene pathway
refactoring and high-throughput DNA assembly and analytical methods. Experience with these tools/approaches
and success in engineering similar synthetic metabolic pathways qualifies this team conduct these studies and
will enable them to accomplish their Phase II goals."
10730203,"The research undertaken for this proposal is significant because it represents the first investigation of the role
of Orexin signaling in the cochlea and as such, will result in novel basic knowledge of a new signaling pathway
related to cochlear function. We will also define potential safety concerns regarding impacts to hearing health
associated with the use of an insomnia drug that is already used by a significant portion of the US population.
The Orexins are a family of two peptides that in the brain are exclusively expressed in hypothalamic neurons.
Both Orexin receptors, however, are widely dispersed throughout the brain. Defective Orexin signaling has
been linked to sporadic nonfamilial narcolepsy, the most common form of narcolepsy, and therefore most
research on Orexin signaling targets sleep/wake behavior. Using immunohistochemistry, we show that the
Orexin pre-prohormone, both mature Orexins peptides, and their receptors are expressed in the cochlea. We
demonstrate that Orexin A/B pre-prohormone gene null mice (thus lacking all Orexin ligands) do not recover
ABR thresholds following noise exposures that induce classic TTS in wild type mice. This is a translationally
significant finding because Ox1R and Ox2R are targets of Orexin receptor antagonist pharmaceuticals such as
Suvorexant (Belsomra®) marketed to treat insomnia. Approximately 30% of adults in the US report symptoms
of insomnia and 4% reported prescription sleep aid use in the month prior to a 2013 CDC poll. While sleep aids
are meant for brief duration use, they are often used for long periods of time (months to years). This is
especially true of aged individuals and those suffering from any of numerous other conditions (PTSD, anxiety,
etc.). A major question is whether a latent risk exists in using Orexin-targeting insomnia medications- do these
drugs leave patients at risk for hearing dysfunction, especially if taken consistently over time that would result
in incomplete clearance of the drug? This work is further translationally relevant because sleep aids are often
used by older individuals, who as a population suffer from abnormal sleep patterns/insomnia and also typically
are experiencing normal age-related hearing dysfunction. Our goal for this project is to: 1) verify and expand
our preliminary data obtained with Orexin ligand nulls by demonstrating which receptor (Ox1R , Ox2R, or both)
contribute to the loss of hearing following moderate-level sound exposures; and 2) begin an assessment of the
mechanisms underlying the observed dysfunction associated with loss of Orexin signaling. We will use a
combination of morphological (immunostaining for afferent synapses under IHCs), physiological (ABRs and
DPs), and protein expression (cytokine arrays) analyses to investigate the role of Orexin signaling in
maintenance of hearing sensitivity following noise exposures. We will also examine the noise-induced local
immune responses of the cochlea by assessing the inflammatory state and numbers of immune cells infiltrating
the cochlea following Orexin receptor genetic manipulation and noise exposure."
10798216,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Cancer and neurodegeneration are often thought to be on opposing ends of the disease spectrum – the
former characterized by unchecked cell growth and the latter by premature cell death. However, they are linked
by dysregulation of a common underlying cellular state: protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Proteostasis refers
to the dynamic balance of protein synthesis, folding and degradation, the maintenance of which is required for
the vast majority of cellular processes. Defects in proteostasis lead to protein aggregation, a hallmark of
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and ALS. Conversely, many
cancer cells overexpress proteostasis machinery to counteract high mutational loads. The long-term goal of my
research program is to define the mechanisms that healthy cells employ to maintain proteostasis and to
establish how this regulation breaks down and is hijacked in disease.
 The central regulatory axis of the proteostasis network (PN) is the heat shock response (HSR), a
universally conserved gene expression program under the control of transcription factor Hsf1 in eukaryotes.
Despite its identification 30 year ago, the mechanisms that control Hsf1 activity and thereby expression of the
HSR have remained elusive. Recent work from my laboratory using budding yeast revealed a key feedback
loop that governs Hsf1 activity. We found that the chaperone Hsp70 represses Hsf1 in unstressed cells and
that Hsf1-mediated induction of Hsp70 is requied to deactivate Hsf1. Thus, Hsf1 and Hsp70 constitute a
feedback loop that promotes homeostatic adaptation to stress
 This proposal builds upon this discovery and the tools and assays we have developed to answer major
outstanding questions concerning Hsf1 regulation. In Aim 1 we will define the upstream signaling events that
activate Hsf1. We hypothesize that ribosome-nascent chain complexes with C-terminal alanine/threonine
extensions (“CAT-tails”) and newly synthesized “orphan” ribosomal proteins (oRPs) trigger the HSR by
sequestering the Hsp70 co-chaperone Sis1 away from Hsf1. In Aim 2 we will define the molecular mechanisms
by which Hsp70 represses Hsf1. We will test the hypothesis that Hsp70 represses Hsf1 both by inhibiting Hsf1
DNA binding and by blocking Hsf1-mediated transactivation. In Aim 3 we will reveal novel feedback loops that
control Hsf1. We will systematically determine the contribution of all Hsf1 targets to wild-type Hsf1 activation
dynamics. By undertaking a multi-faceted analysis of the HSR – combining cell biology, molecular genetics,
biochemistry and systems biology – we will establish the signals, regulatory mechanisms and feedback loops
that govern this central adaptive circuit that lies at the heart of human diseases as diverse as cancer and
neurodegeneration."

Biomotors are protein machines that convert chemical energy to different kinds of mechanical motions essential
to cellular functions. The bacteriophage φ29 genome packaging motor is one of the most powerful biomotors
reported. It is responsible for packaging the viral genomic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into a preformed
protein shell (procapsid) using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source. Co-PI Guo has focused on
addressing basic questions on the mechanisms of assembly and function of the φ29 motor for decades. Recently,
the Guo lab proposed a revolving mechanism for the φ29 motor in which DNA revolves rather than rotates during
packaging. His lab has also demonstrated the feasibility of engineering and adapting the motor channel for DNA
sensing and fingerprinting at the single-molecule level. These findings bring about immense potential of the
powerful φ29 motor, but to fully embrace it for future nanotechnological applications will inevitably require a more
detailed understanding of how the motor assembles and operates, much of which is only beginning to be
elucidated. Major controversies still exist regarding the stoichiometry and architecture of the functional motor
complex and the mechanisms by which DNA is translocated. The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate
the molecular mechanisms of the bacteriophage φ29 dsDNA packaging motor through identification and
characterization of the motor complex at a variety of functional states using state-of-the-art cryo-electron
microscopy (EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and leverage the knowledge gleaned for the design
and fabrication of a biologically active ATP-driven procapsid-free nanomotor that provides unprecedented
functionality. We propose three specific aims to tackle these challenging problems by integrating advanced cryo-
EM (co-PI Mao) and computational (PI Cheng) approaches with well-established biochemical/molecular biology
protocols (co-PI Guo) to increase the chances of success and impact of the results. In Aim 1, we will combine
cryo-EM and our advanced computational image analysis techniques to identify and characterize a variety of
motor intermediates in situ. To achieve high resolutions, we will explore ways to control the dynamics of the
motor to obtain structurally more homogeneous specimens. In Aim 2, we will implement and utilize a pipeline of
MD simulations to map the various cryo-EM structures obtained in Aim 1 onto the free energy landscapes of the
motor complex, and connect them into molecular “movies” to elucidate at the atomic level how stepwise,
distributed conformational dynamics in the motor complex are coordinated to drive DNA translocation. Finally in
Aim 3, we will leverage the molecular insights into motor assembly and operation gleaned from Aims 1&2 to
construct a biologically active procapsid-free φ29 mimetic nanomotor by reconstituting it into a lipid bilayer
platform, which will open up enormous opportunities for a wide range of applications in nanotechnology and
nanomedicine."
10817069,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is an aldosterone (Aldo)-activated receptor that regulates gene transcription
(genomic) and cellular signaling (non-genomic) to control cell functions and regulate blood pressure (BP). MR
activation is increased in resistant hypertension, obesity, heart failure and the elderly. Increased Aldo predicts
high risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke and MR antagonists are protective out of proportion to BP
lowering, supporting kidney-independent mechanisms. MI and stroke are caused by rupture and thrombosis of
inflamed atherosclerotic (athero) plaques. Women are protected from MI and stroke relative to men until
menopause thereby implicating another hormone, estrogen (E2), while obese women with metabolic syndrome
lose premenopausal protection with rising mortality in this growing demographic. We recently showed that MR
in endothelial cells (EC) contributes to vascular inflammation in athero in male mice by inducing leukocyte
recruitment to vessels and expression of ICAM1 and E-selectin (E-sel) and that this is prevented in females. We
also showed that estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) interacts with the MR in ECs, blocking MR regulation of ICAM1
and that EC-MR-KO protects obese females from EC dysfunction. New data shows that ICAM1 expression is
decreased in primary human ECs from females vs males and this is reversed in obese females; that EC-MR
inhibits the non-genomic effect of E2 to increase nitric oxide (NO); and that myeloid (My)-MR-KO decreases
plaque size and inflammation in ApoE-KO mice, leukocyte rolling by intravital microscopy (IVM), and
macrophage expression of EC adhesion ligands. Based on these data, we propose to test the hypothesis that
EC- and My-MR coordinate vascular inflammation in athero and that females are protected by genomic and non-
genomic interactions between MR and ERa. To test this, we have created innovative reagents and methods
including mice with EC-specific deletion of MR, ERa or both and myeloid-specific deletion of MR, each crossed
to athero-prone genetic mouse models; a mesenteric IVM assay to test sex differences in leukocyte traficking;
EC lines with ERa functional mutants; and a biobank of age matched male and female human aortic ECs. Using
these tools we propose 2 specific aims, each using in vitro and in vivo approaches: SA1 explores the genomic
and non-genomic mechanisms by which MR and ERa interact in ECs to regulate leukocyte recruitment and
plaque inflammation and how this mediates sex differences; SA2 determines the role of My-MR in immune cell
trafficking, plaque macrophage phenotype, and sex-differences in myeloid-T cell interactions. Using these
innovative models, methods, and reagents tailored to study sex-differences, this proposal investigates the novel
concept that EC- and My-MR coordinate vascular and immune cell responses to induce leukocyte recruitment
and vascular inflammation in athero. Completion of the aims will identify mechanisms underlying increased
cardiovascular (CV) risk in growing populations with elevated MR activity and for sex differences in CV disease."
10790010,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are critical gaps in our understanding of the endosomal pathway and its functional impact on the patho-
genesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD).
The overarching goal of this study is to build an independent research program dedicated to elucidating the
cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration and discovering novel therapeutic targets. The objective of this pro-
posal is to reveal the endosomal dysfunction that causes neurodegeneration in Christianson syndrome, as well
as to establish mechanistic links to related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD/ADRD. Loss-of-function
mutations in Na+/H+Exchanger 6 (NHE6) cause an endosomal neurological disorder called Christianson syn-
drome (CS), which presents tau-associated neurodegenerative pathologies. We have recently published a new
study describing a novel rat model of CS, which better represents neurodegenerative features than the current
mouse model. The central hypothesis is that NHE6 deletion impairs late endosomal function, which may contrib-
ute to AD/ADRD-related pathologies. The rationale for this study is to establish a better understanding of defec-
tive endosomal pathways which may act as a pathogenic hub in CS and AD/ADRD. Together with my recently
published work and preliminary data, mounting evidence emphasizes the function of NHE6 in AD/ADRD. Ex-
panding our knowledge of the NHE6-mediated endosomal pathway will accelerate the identification of novel
therapeutic targets for CS and AD/ADRD. This proposal will take multidisciplinary approaches including ad-
vanced imaging methods. During the mentored K99 phase, mechanisms whereby the loss of NHE6 disrupt ax-
onal transport (Aim1) and late endosomal maturation (Aim2) will be defined. Aim1 and Aim2 will be performed
under the guidance of Dr. Eric Morrow, who is a leader in the field of endolysomal cell biology and rare neuro-
genetic disorders including CS. My advisory team will bring unique and complementary skills and knowledge,
which will further enhance my training. During the K99 phase, I will boost my expertise in advanced super-
resolution microscope (SRM) imaging and broaden my knowledge in endolysomal cell biology and neurodegen-
erative disorders, especially AD/ADRD. I will utilize these acquired skills and knowledge to perform the R00 aim
(Aim3), which will determine the impact of NHE6 deletion on AD/ADRD pathology in a transgenic AD rat model.
This proposal ise methodologically and conceptually innovative. It will utilize SRM and novel rat models, as rats
are more genetically and physiologically closer to humans than mice. Also, it will refine our current view of NHE6
function and reveal endosomal dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders. Overall, this proposal will allow me
to acquire rigorous scientific training in both neuronal cell biology and neurodegeneration through the strong
mentorship and research program. This award will enable me to launch an independent research program ded-
icated to elucidating cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and other aging-related disorders."

My long-term career goal is to become a clinician investigator, who uses health information technology (IT) to
improve cardiovascular outcomes among patients with social needs. The research goal of this application is to
use health IT to reduce preventable readmissions for heart failure (HF) among patients with low health literacy
with the incorporation of behavioral science and usability testing. Social determinants of health (SDH) account
for 80% of health outcomes, and social needs are associated with poor health outcomes, including 30-day
readmissions. Addressing individuals’ social needs has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, but
may take a prolonged time to effectively reduce 30-day readmissions. Health literacy, which measures a
patient’s ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and
actions for themselves and others, is associated with patients’ health outcomes. Low health literacy is common
among patients with HF, and leads to poor management of HF. Extant interventions, such as patient
navigators and handouts, have been utilized successfully to improve medical care for patients with low health
literacy, but they are episodic and resource-intensive. The use of health IT tools, such as a personalized,
automated text-message-based application, can be utilized for post-hospitalization care. Our preliminary study
indicates that patients with HF who use this application had reduced 30-day readmissions, compared to
patients with HF who did not use the application. However, the number of patients with HF using the
application has been limited, due to low uptake and high attrition rate. The overall objective of the proposed
research project is to incorporate nudges, and address barriers to improve patients’ use of the application, and
conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the application’s use in reducing 30-day
readmissions. We will conduct qualitative work to gain insights into how to adapt an extant text messaging
intervention to improve its use among patients with low health literacy (Aim 1), conduct usability testing and
iterative revision of the application (Aim 2), and conduct a pilot RCT to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility,
and preliminary efficacy of using behavioral interventions to increase the application use for patients with HF
post-discharge (Aim 3). The training from this mentored career development award will provide skills in four
domains: 1) behavioral science; 2) implementation science; 3) health literacy; and 4) RCT design and conduct.
The proposed research activities, and the training and mentoring plans will provide the foundation for my
career as an independent clinician investigator."

Present therapeutic agents are designed to inhibit the myometrial contractions or cervical ripening to delay
delivery in the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). These approaches have limited success in reducing
the overall rate of PTB, which his ~11% in the USA. A novel drug delivery system needs to be designed to
improve pregnancy outcomes. Successful pregnancy is determined by regulatory mechanisms at the F-M,
ensuring that both innate and adaptive immune cells aptly support fetoplacental development by balancing
inflammation while remodeling uterine tissues. Immune dysregulation, primarily mediated by a fetal
inflammatory response to pregnancy-associated risk factors (eg, infections), leads to PTB. The inability of
drugs to cross feto-maternal interface barriers to treat both the mother and her fetus, as well as lack of proper
ways of testing drug transport, metabolic changes, teratogenicity, and cytotoxicity, has hindered PTB drug
development. Using, the naturally occurring anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, enclosed in
exosomes (extracellular vesicles, 40–160 nm) engineered by electroporation (eIL-10), IL-10 crossed the
placental barrier, delayed PTB induced by LPS, and reduced fetal inflammatory response compared to LPS
alone. However, the method of electroporation will alter the tropism of exosomes, and the production of
recombinant IL-10 loaded exosomes is very expensive. To overcome these electroporation limitations, we
developed an alternate approach to produce large quantities of IL-10 enriched exosomes by incorporating IL-
10 plasmid into mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) and stimulating them with dexamethasone (Dex). Dex
induces IL-10 production and will be packaged in large quantities in exosomes (eIL-10). This approach has
overcome the limitation of electroporation and increased the efficiency of IL-10 packaging in exosomes during
biogenesis. Thus, the approach minimizes alterations of exosome proteins, and the production of eIL-10 will be
cost-effective. We will test the hypothesis that eIL-10 will reduce the incidence of ascending infection (E. coli)
induced PTB mouse model. We propose the following aims to test our hypothesis.
1) To characterize eIL-10 and determine its functional activity in in vitro studies,
2) To determine efficacy and biodistribution of exosomal IL-10 (eIL-10) in in vivo studies.
Our innovative approach will prolong pregnancy and can translate into a critically needed specific interventional
strategy to decrease infection/inflammation associated with PTB
and thereby improve pregnancy outcomes."

Candida albicans causes half of all invasive fungal infections in humans. Its success as a pathogen is due to its
ability to adapt and thrive in various microenvironments in the host. Using a forward genetics screen, we identified
an uncharacterized gene NDU1 whose loss caused C. albicans to lose viability on alternative carbon sources
and made the organism completely avirulent in vivo. We found that Candida-Ndu1 protein possesses three
evolutionarily acquired stretches of amino acid inserts (~64 amino acids), absent from all other eukaryotes
including humans. We reported for the first time that ~17% of the Candida proteome possess “additional” sets
of evolutionarily acquired amino-acid inserts, that are absent from all non-CTG clade eukaryotes, including
humans. The role of insert regions in C. albicans proteome remains to be unraveled. We have shown that the
Ndu1 insertion sequences are vital and required for Ndu1’s activity. In aim 1, the mechanistic contribution of
Ndu1 inserts will be investigated by protein biochemistry studies. The role of insert regions in other Candida
proteins will also be evaluated , to understand if inserts are universally important for function.
Considering Ndu1 is important for growth and virulence in vivo, we targeted Ndu1 and its insert regions for
development of antifungal molecules. We identified a repurposed FDA approved drug niclosamide (NCL), and
developed Eudragit EPO nanoparticle formulations of this molecule to enhance its solubility and bioavailability.
NCL nanoparticles (NCL-EPO-NP) could prevent growth of Candida in alternative carbon sources, penetrate
and dismantle mature biofilms in vitro, and eradicate it in vivo in biofilm models of mucosal candidiasis. The
activity of NCL-NP was 6-10 fold higher than the generic drug alone. In Aim 2, we further characterize and
evaluate NCL-EPO-NP for their pharmacokinetics and oral biodistribution, toxicity profiles and in vivo efficacy in
an oral regimen for treatment of oral candidiasis, as standalone or adjunct therapy with other antifungal drugs."
10854778,"In 2015, 9.4% of the United States population had diabetes and statistically about 50% of these patients will or
already have developed diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). This problem is even more critical in the
veteran health care population with nearly 25% of veterans having diabetes, primarily type 2. In veterans
diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end-stage renal disease and non-trauma related amputations. The
only treatment for DPN is glycemic control, which is ineffective in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Thus, there is a
critical need of a treatment for DPN. Our studies have demonstrated that treating diabetic rodents with DPN
with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from menhaden (fish) oil initiates nerve damage
repair and reverses DPN. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the predominate
omega-3 PUFA found in fish oil and are the precursors of E and D series resolvins, respectively, which have
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. We have shown that these metabolites alone elicit repair of
nerve damage caused by diabetes when administered endogenously in vivo. As we initiate plans to advance
omega-3 PUFA to a clinical trial for DPN there remains several questions to be addressed. One common
problem with the design of many of the previous clinical trials of omega-3 PUFA primarily for treatment of
cardiovascular disease were that they failed to determine the circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA or their
metabolites over the course of the study. For most of these studies it was unknown whether dosing was
sufficient to make a therapeutic change in the omega-3 index, defined as the sum of EPA and DHA as a
percentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells. Another poorly explored question has been what is the best
source or composition of omega-3 PUFAs that will provide the most favorable and safe outcome? This is
highlighted by the recent REDUCE-IT study that found that a 4 g daily dose of icosapent ethyl (ethyl ester of
EPA) to have a statistical benefit on reducing ischemic events in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia. Was the
significant outcome achieved in this study due to icosapent ethyl being a more effective source of omega-3
PUFA or use of a higher dose than many previous studies? We have shown that treating type 2 diabetic rats
with fish oil that achieved an omega-3 PUFA concentration in serum that was obtained in human subjects
treated with 4 g of fish oil per day is an efficacious treatment for DPN. However, is fish oil the best source of
omega-3 PUFA for the treatment of DPN or are the ethyl ester derivatives of EPA and/or DHA more
efficacious? Ethyl esters of EPA (Vascepa®) or the combination of EPA and DHA (Lovaza®) are
pharmaceutical compounds and represent a highly purified and concentrated source of EPA and DHA and void
of the less favorable compounds found in fish oil. Studies have shown that EPA and DHA and their metabolites
have different molecular targets. Since the etiology of DPN is complex having both vascular and neural
pathological pathways it is likely that a combination of EPA and DHA as found in Lovaza® will be needed for
an effective treatment of DPN. Besides these pharmaceutical compounds are there other “healthy” alternatives
to fish oil for the treatment of DPN? Commercially available algae's that primarily produce EPA or DHA may be
another environmental friendly and safe source of omega-3 PUFA. The studies presented in this application
will rigorously address the use of these alternative sources of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment for DPN and
determine if omega-3 PUFA derived from pharmaceutical compounds i.e. ethyl ester derivatives of EPA or
EPA/DHA or from industrial sources such as algae's that solely produce EPA or DHA free of cholesterol may
be a better choice than fish oil. The proposed studies will be conducted in rat models of pre-diabetes and type
2 diabetes and will investigate translational endpoints including assessment of motor coordination and balance
and function and density of sensory neurons to track the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA on peripheral neuropathy
and the results correlated with the omega-3 index and circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA metabolites."

“High-risk” human papillomavirus (HPV) types such as 16 (HPV-16) are identified in the majority of HPV-
associated pre-malignant and malignant pathologies of cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal epithelia. The
E6 protein is essential for viral replication and cellular models of oncogenic transformation. We hypothesized
that small molecules that bind to and form a covalent bond with E6 will antagonize its functions, including the
ability to bind the ubiquitin ligase E6AP and recruitment of p53 for proteasomal degradation. Structure-based
computational screening followed by design and synthesis of derivatives led to the identification of a series of
small molecules that interact with and form a covalent bond to the HPV-16 E6 protein and inhibit both
E6•E6AP association in vitro and E6-mediated p53 degradation in cells. Time- and concentration-dependent
mass spectrometry and high resolution co-crystal structures of four small molecules bound to E6 confirmed
this hypothesis. The objective of this grant application is to extend our discovery of novel E6 inhibitor
chemotypes using computational, biochemical, crystallographic, pharmacologic and cell biological assays to
increase potency and activity. In Aim 1, we combine predictive modeling algorithms with these X-ray
structures to instruct modifications that engage additional residues at the E6•E6AP interface. In Aim 2, robust
biochemical techniques will characterize the binding and reaction kinetics of these inhibitors. X-ray
crystallography will be applied to resolve atomic coordinates of new compounds bound to HPV E6 and thereby
guide the structure-based computational designs proposed in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we test the small-molecule E6
inhibitors for their specific ability to restore p53 levels, and induce apoptosis ord senescence using HPV-16
expressing cancer cell lines. Direct engagement of E6 in cells will be investigated and potential off-target
cellular proteins will be identified. Our expectation is that 2-3 drug-like candidates will emerge that selectively
inhibit HPV-16 E6 function and exhibit sub-micromolar IC50 activity and suitable pharmacologic properties to
advance toward first in human clinical trials."
10813891,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cells perform diverse processes, such as cell division, growth, motility, formation of adhesions, and tissue
morphogenesis, under a wide range of mechanical environments. Central to these processes are mechanical
forces, which may come from outside the cell or be generated internally and which are integrated with signaling
pathways to guide the cellular process. The cell's macromolecular cytoskeletal machinery, including the actin-
based myosin II motors and actin crosslinking proteins, assemble, function and then disassemble in response to
these forces and signaling pathways. This dynamic force-responsive assembly provides self-tuning of the
machinery, leading to natural positive and negative feedback and further allows mechanical inputs to be
converted into signaling outputs. Using Dictyostelium cells, we discovered that many of these components are
pre-assembled in the cytoplasm in the form of mechanoresponsive Contractility Kits (CKs), which allow for highly
efficient responses to force inputs. The CKs include myosin II, cortexillin I, IQGAP1, IQGAP2, plus several other
proteins that we know of. For this application, substantial published and unpublished data motivate the questions
to be answered, and our work extends from Dictyostelium to human proteins and model systems. We begin by
leveraging our suite of experimental and modeling platforms, including a new modeling framework called
SpringSaLaD, which allows for molecularly motivated, particle-based, stochastic simulations of biochemical
processes. Using SpringSaLaD, we are modeling the formation of CKs by drawing upon measured in vivo
concentrations, diffusion constants, and in vivo “apparent” KDs. From this model, we have made an initial list of
predictions about the features of the CKs, which we will test in Dictyostelium. We will also explore the kinetics of
assembly and disassembly of the CKs with and without mechanical force. For assembly, we will determine the
molecular basis for force-dependent assembly of the CKs and nonmuscle myosin II bipolar thick filament (BTF),
using interference scattering mass spectrometry. For disassembly, we will use magnetic tweezers to measure
the compliance within the BTF and then determine how this compliance restricts the activity of the myosin heavy
chain kinase (MHCKC for Dictyostelium and PKCzeta for NMIIB). We have also found that the setpoint of
mechanosensitive accumulation (mechanoaccumulation) by Dictyostelium myosin II and human NMIIB has an
optimum of 20% assembly fraction. Further, NMIIB's setpoint is cell type- and cell cycle stage-specific. We will
use the framework we have established to determine the consequences of setpoint positioning on cell behavior,
including NMIIB dynamics, cell division, and gene expression. We will incorporate this information into our
computational models for myosin II mechanoaccumulation, expanding the models to include the components of
the CKs. In sum, this research effort, which spans molecular to cellular scales combined with physical theory
development, will decipher key principles and mechanisms of force-dependent cytoskeletal assembly and the
impact on cell behavior."
10899428,"Project Summary / Abstract
Heart failure (HF) affects ~6.2 million Americans and is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the U.S.
Hospitalizations for heart failure (HHF) account for 80% of HF costs since 83% of HF patients are hospitalized
at least once and 43% at least four times. About 30% of HF patients die within one year of being hospitalized.
Black HF patients experience higher hospitalization rates over time compared to White HF patients.
Angiotensin Inhibitors prevent HHF. Although these drugs are most effective in patients with reduced ejection
fraction (HFrEF), HHF patients remain high, suggesting that drug response differs between individuals. Race
seems to be a critical factor in angiotensin inhibitor response because White HF patients experienced a 44%
reduction in the risk of HHF on these drugs, while this effect was not seen in Black HF patients. Although this
difference in responsiveness to angiotensin inhibitors is not yet fully understood, these drugs are guideline-
recommended for all HFrEF patients. Given the increasing frequency, costs, and grave outcomes, there is a
critical need to understand the factors underlying racial disparity in the angiotensin inhibitor-associated
reduction of HFrEF hospitalizations. Race is a complex construct of social and genomic variables, and both
may play a role in this racial disparity. Our central hypothesis is social variables better explain this racial
disparity. Therefore, the overall objective is to understand the effects of self-identified race, genomics, and
social variables in the racial disparity of angiotensin inhibitor-associated reductions in HFrEF hospitalizations.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies often rely on self-identified race instead of genomic ancestry, and findings of
genetic variants responsible for differences in HF treatment outcomes are inconsistent. Aim 1 overcomes this
limitation with a diverse cohort of HFrEF patients (N=575 Black, N=547 White) in the Henry Ford Heart Failure
PGx registry (HFPGR) with whole-genome data, allowing for ancestral quantification and access to electronic
medical records. Many studies investigating racial disparities in HHF are outdated, given current knowledge on
access to care that can influence HHF. Aim 2 overcomes this limitation with access to a more contemporary
dataset where patients have similar health care access and quality. Studies investigating the effects of social
determinants of health (SDoH) on HHF found cumulative increases of specific social variables were associated
with an increased risk of HHF but did not investigate drug-specific social variables. Aim 3 overcomes this
limitation by testing for interactions using self-identified race, genomic ancestry, and social variables
specifically related to angiotensin inhibitor benefit in HFrEF hospitalizations. The overall approach is to analyze
an existing clinical and genomics dataset (HFPGR) with HHF as the primary outcome. This research is feasible
by leveraging an existing dataset, the expertise of my sponsors, resources at the University of Michigan and
Henry Ford Health System, and established methods. In completing this project, I will learn critical research
skills in PGx and social services that will prepare me for more advanced, post-doctoral training."
10821321,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Natural products are potently active, privileged scaffolds that form the basis of our therapeutic arsenal across
all areas of human health. The continued development of natural products and their analogs will provide access
to compounds with improved activity and pharmacological properties while decreasing off-target effects. The
bioengineering of individual biosynthetic enzymes is one method of generating such novel secondary
metabolites. However, bioengineering efforts are often stymied due to a lack of fundamental understanding of
the discrete enzymatic transformations responsible for natural product biosynthesis. Likewise, whole pathway
metabolic engineering focused on generating novel secondary metabolites with targeted structural alterations
requires detailed knowledge of individual biosynthetic steps.
 Fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) are pivotal biosynthetic domains that draw fatty acids from primary
metabolism for incorporation into more complex natural product scaffolds. The FAAL domains are often linked
with multidomain polyketide synthases either in cis or trans via structural linker regions or docking domains,
respectively. We hypothesize that these linker regions and docking domains are crucial to the transfer of fatty
acid chains of specific lengths to the downstream polyketide synthase domains and that we can modulate this
transfer by maintaining the appropriate key elements. This proposal seeks to identify the key residues that control
the activation and transfer of fatty acid chains in a model system for application to more complex pathways. As
well, we seek to develop a robust heterologous host capable of producing these fatty acid-containing metabolites.
 In Aim I, we will use our model system olefin (Ols) synthase to identify and modulate the gate-keeping linker
regions and docking domains that govern fatty acid integration into secondary metabolites. Directed evolution
experiments using the bacterial two-hybrid system will allow us to dissect the key docking domains found in Ols
homologs that contain a trans enzymatic structure. In a complementary system, we will perform directed
evolution experiments targeted towards the linker regions of cis Ols synthases and directly assess metabolite
production via a temperature selection screening. Aim I will uncover the key structural elements in the model Ols
synthase for future bioengineering of more complex natural product enzymes with similar biosynthetic logic.
 In Aim II, we propose to develop Pseudomonas putida for the heterologous expression of fatty acid-
containing natural products. The pathways for our model Ols synthase as well as the biosynthetic gene cluster
encoding for micacocidin production will be expressed in P. putida. The production and bioengineering of the
FAAL-ACP domains to integrate acyl chains of varying length will be encoded in this heterologous host to
facilitate engineering efforts. The bioengineering of the FAAL-ACP loading modules in Ols synthase and the
micacocidin pathway will be guided by our work from Aim I."

We present a complete platform for the rapid generation and validation of recombinant mAbs. The
innovations of this proposal include: (1) the pATHENA vector system for overnight conversion of phage
display scFv or Fab clones into IgG molecules, (2) the Epivolve method for the isolation of site-specific
Abs, (3) the incorporation of yeast display into pATHENA to allow biophysical measurement of binding
affinities without the need for protein isolation, and (4) our MILKSHAKE technology for the validation of Abs
for IHC, Western, and ELISA applications. This proposal is a culmination of- and largely a focused
integration of several independent technologies that have been developed (and de-risked) by the principal
investigator (PI). We now want to incorporate these technologies and add them into a single Abbratech
platform. In essence, the proposal is a very robust set of molecular biology modules for: (i) library
construction, (ii) library screening using both phage- and yeast display, (iii) biophysical and kinetic analysis,
(iv) directed evolution, (v) affinity maturation (“AffMat”), (vi) protein engineering, (vii) production of site-
directed Abs, (viii) protein expression integrated into a single platform, and (viii) Ab validation for flow
cytometry, ICC, ELISA and Western applications. All parts of the proposed workflow have either can be-
or have already been automated for high-throughput (HT) production with off-the-shelf robotic solutions.
The proposed platform represents an innovative way to deliver recombinant mAbs, at ideally a retail total
cost of less than several thousand dollars (costs are discussed in the Commercialization plan). This
accuracy, specificity, projected timeline, and cost cannot be currently achieved by any other commercially
available mAb discovery platform. This proposal meets a need that has not been markedly improved upon
since the advent of monoclonal Abs forty years ago and phage display, around the same time. And it can
finally place phage display as a primary engine of diversity, replacing the inefficient and time-consuming
immunization schedules that even phage display advocates fall back on. The significance is high, the team
is well-qualified, the innovation, tactical and strategic, is imaginative, and even though the scope of this
Phase II is daunting, the team is well-equipped to do it."

Radiation therapy (RT) is widely used to treat localized prostate cancer (PCa). However, cancer cells often
develop resistance to RT through unknown mechanisms, resulting in cancer recurrence. To improve RT, there
is a dire need to uncover cellular events that cause cells to become resistant. We previously demonstrated that
PCa heterogeneity, particularly in prostate cancers with an abundant mitochondria subpopulation, often survive
and regrow after RT (termed radiation resistant prostate cancer, or RR-PCa). Elevation of mitochondrial mass,
number, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and biogenesis markers is acquired in RR-PCa cells. We further
demonstrated that knockdown of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, TFAM (transcription factor A,
mitochondrial), significantly restored the sensitivity of RR-PCa cells to RT. Hence, our overarching hypothesis is
that RT-activated mitochondrial biogenesis, via ROS, is an acquisition mechanism that drives PCa survival post-
RT, a premise that will undergo stringent examination in the proposed studies. ROS are known to directly and
indirectly regulate mitochondrial homeostasis through fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis. We screened
FDA-approved drugs in search of compounds that are nontoxic to normal cells and have the ability to raise the
level of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (mtH2O2) in PCa cells while blocking mitochondrial protein translation.
We found azithromycin (AZM), a macrolide antibiotic, to be an effective prototype compound that possesses
both properties. We further demonstrated that AZM combined with RT enhances the death of PCa cells with an
abundant mitochondrial subpopulation, compared to AZM or RT alone. Thus, we propose to advance our findings
and identify the mechanism(s) that effectively inhibit the survival of post-irradiated cancer cells, to improve RT
efficacy. The specific aims are: 1) to define the molecular mechanism(s) by which RT-activated mitochondrial
biogenesis promotes cell survival and metabolic adaptations of PCa cells with abundant mitochondria, both in
vitro and in vivo; 2) to determine if overloading mtH2O2 to target inherent mitochondria and RT-acquired
mitochondria while blocking mitochondrial protein translation in RT-acquired mitochondria enhances
radiosensitivity of RR-PCa cells, and 3) to improve RT using a mtH2O2 generator and a mitochondrial protein
translation inhibitor, AZM as prototype, in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model and a patient-derived xenograft
model of PCa with activated mitochondrial biogenesis. This study uses state-of-the-art platforms including the
reverse phase protein array, stable isotope-resolved metabolomics, super-resolution microscopy with Imaris
software, TEMPOL-enhanced MRI imaging, and a high resolution O2k-FluoRespirometer. The proposed studies
are expected to uncover novel molecular insights by which concurrently targeting mitochondrial redox capacity
and mitochondrial biogenesis improve RT efficacy of RR-PCa."

Oral cancer pain is more severe than all other cancers. Patients with metastatic oral cancer experience the
greatest pain. Oral cancers activate neurons and produce pain; however, the effect of nociceptors on oral
cancer is largely unknown. The mechanisms of reciprocal interaction between oral cancer and neurons, and
how the interactions promote cancer and pain, are not known. The long-term goal is to improve management
of oral cancer patients and obviate opioids by identifying components of the cancer microenvironment that are
viable targets to treat cancer and oral cancer pain. The overall objectives for this application are to (i) elucidate
the phenotype and distribution of transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid subfamily member (TRPV1) +
neurons innervating painful and metastatic oral cancers, (ii) measure sensitization and activation of TRPV1+
neurons by mediators secreted by oral cancer, and (iii) determine the contribution of TRPV1+ neurons to oral
carcinogenesis. The central hypothesis is that oral cancers release mediators, including mediators carried in
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that sensitize and activate nociceptors inducing oral cancer pain. The cancer-
primed nociceptors, in turn, promote cancer. The rationale for the project is that identification of components of
the cancer-nerve interaction provides the opportunity to develop approaches to treat oral cancer and oral
cancer pain, thereby reducing use of opioids. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Determine the type and density of innervation in oral cancers in relation to pain and metastasis; 2)
Investigate sensitization of trigeminal (TG) neurons by cancer pain mediators; and, 3) Investigate cancer
promotion by cancer activated and sensitized TRPV1+ neurons and evaluate the potential to stop cancer and
alleviate cancer pain by antagonizing signaling via the sensory neuropeptide, calcitonin gene related peptide
(CGRP). Under the first aim, neuronal innervation of the cancer will be evaluated in a retrospective patient
cohort with known pain and nodal status, and testing for capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist) sensitivity and
measurement of pain will be performed in prospectively enrolled oral cancer patients. For the second aim, a
gene associated with pain and metastasis and miRNAs from EVs will be investigated as pain mediators. For
the third aim a mouse oral carcinogenesis model will be used to investigate the impact of TRPV1 abundance
on cancer incidence and phenotype, the impact of CGRP signaling on cancer promotion, and the potential for
CGRP/CGRP receptor therapies for treating and preventing oral cancer and oral cancer pain. The research
proposed is innovative because it is based on two new findings regarding oral cancer pain: (1) newly identified
putative cancer pain mediators overexpressed in metastatic cancers from patients reporting high levels of pain,
and (2) involvement of EVs in cancer induced nociceptive behavior. The proposed research is significant
because these studies will lay the foundation for clinical trials to assess CGRP and CGRP receptor targeted
therapies, which are FDA-approved for migraine, to treat cancer and attenuate cancer pain."

vascularization have been explored in both pre-clinical models and clinical trials. However,
approaches involving delivery of a single cell type to ischemic sites either by intravenous or
intramuscular injection have shown little efficacy in clinical trials, particularly for the treatment of
critical limb ischemia. By contrast, a common approach to vascularize engineered tissues
involves co-encapsulation of endothelial cells (or their progenitors) combined with supportive
stromal cells in a hydrogel-based biomaterial intended to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM).
However, the choices of stromal cells and materials have varied widely across studies. Our
long-term goal is to mechanistically understand how these elements of the microenvironment
influence the quantity, functional quality, and stability of the resulting vasculature. Using a
combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we have shown the rate of formation of nascent
vasculature is regulated by both the biophysical properties of the ECM and the identity of the
supporting stromal cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that stromal cell identity critically
regulates the functional qualities of the microvasculature formed within fibrin hydrogels, both in
vitro and in vivo, with multipotent bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) inducing more stable,
less permeable capillaries compared to fibroblasts from a range of different tissues. Our data
suggest stromal cells of different origins differentially remodel and stiffen the ECM to influence
the rate of vascular morphogenesis, leading to our hypothesis that vessels which form quickly
are of poor quality, while those which form more slowly show superior functionality, maturation,
and persistence. In Aim 1, a combination of approaches will be used in 3D fibrin-based co-
culture models to evaluate the impact of stromal cell identity on vascular morphogenesis rate,
ECM mechanics (global and local), and permeability. In Aim 2, an engineered hydrogel material
will be used to alter the relationships between stromal cell identity, ECM mechanics,
vascularization rate, and vascular permeability. Finally, Aim 3 will examine the effects of
stromal cell identity and morphogenesis rates on the quantity and quality of neovasculature in
multiple in vivo models. Successful completion of these aims will expand the mechanistic
insights attained during the prior funding periods to better understand the roles of the
microenvironment in vascular morphogenesis, and thereby enhance efforts to create functional
vasculature suitable for regenerative medicine and revascularization applications."
10810859,"Abstract: Immunotherapy using programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1) blockade, either alone or in
combination with existing therapies, has been proven to significantly improve survival rates for many
cancers, including triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, only about a quarter of the
patients respond to treatment, typically those with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive
tumors, while a majority experience serious drug related side effects. The efficient selection of likely
responders to immunotherapy is limited by the fact that biopsy, the current screening standard for
PD-L1 expression, provides only a snapshot of biomarker status at a single time point, while it is
known that PD-L1 expression can dynamically change during therapy. Additionally, tumor vascular
“normalization” indicators, such as perfusion, hypoxia and angiogenesis can dynamically change
during treatment, potentially serving as early indicators of treatment efficacy. There is therefore an
urgent need for non-invasive imaging techniques that can longitudinally quantify molecular and
physiological predictive tumor biomarkers before and during treatment. Such techniques can
potentially save non-responders from ineffective treatment and life-threatening effects and can also
facilitate a robust evaluation of new combination therapies that improve survival and prove effective in
a larger patient population. Our preliminary studies using time domain fluorescence imaging indicate
that the fluorescence lifetime (FLT) of immune-receptor targeted near infrared probes is longer in PD-
L1 positive tumors compared to non-specific probe in normal tissue, thereby dramatically improving
sensitivity and specificity compared to fluorescence intensity-based imaging. Furthermore, time
domain imaging allows the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple fluorophores using
spectral and lifetime contrast (multiplexing) and is therefore ideal for imaging multiple molecular and
physiologic parameters of treatment response. The goal of this proposal is to translate these powerful
benefits of FLT to validate tomographic FLT imaging as a new tool for multiplexed longitudinal
monitoring of biomarkers during immunotherapy. We will validate the accuracy of the optical readouts
for monitoring therapeutic response longitudinally in TNBC-bearing mice by comparison with
histology. The feasibility of fluorescence imaging has previously been demonstrated for superficial
lymph nodes and for organs such as the breast. Therefore, validation of FLT multiplexing in
preclinical models is a fundamental step that will lead to targeted clinical trials to evaluate TD
technology for non-invasive functional immunotherapy screening in TNBC patients."
10794958,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disorder that ranks sixth in the leading cause of all deaths in the United States and features amyloid β protein deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. At present, there are no drugs available to halt or reverse disease progression, and all efforts to create such therapies have failed. Recent studies have demonstrated that abnormalities of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain are strongly associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The CYP46A1 enzymatic conversion of brain cholesterol into 24S-hydroxycholesterol is the major elimination mechanism to maintain brain cholesterol homeostasis. Disturbances in CYP46A1 is implicated in the AD physiopathology. Therefore, pharmacological modulation of CYP46A1 represents an attractive AD therapeutic approach. Positron emission tomography (PET) is capable of quantifying biochemical processes in vivo, and a suitable CYP46A1 ligand would substantially improve our understanding of CYP46A1-mediated cholesterol homeostasis under AD physiopathological conditions otherwise inaccessible by ex vivo (destructive) analysis. Quantification of CYP46A1 in living AD brain by PET would provide the assessment of distribution, target engagement and dose occupancy of new AD therapeutics. To date, no successful examples have been demonstrated to image CYP46A1 for clinical use, representing a significant deficiency of our ability to study this target in vivo. Therefore, we propose to develop a novel PET ligand that can fill this void, as the first translational imaging tool for AD.
Our ligand [11C]CYP-507 demonstrated the first prototype for imaging towards CYP46A1, but was discontinued due to marginal binding specificity and low brain penetration. In our next generation, we successfully identified a lead molecule, CYP-812, which showed high binding affinity and high selectivity. An 11C-isotopologue of CYP-812 was synthesized and preliminary PET studies confirmed that we have overcome the major obstacles for CYP46A1 ligand development by achieving: 1) reasonable and regional-specific brain uptake; 2) moderate target specificity. Though CYP-812 is a promising lead, further optimizations aimed at higher brain permeability, improved potency and binding specificity with proper brain kinetics are sought for translational cross-species (rodents and nonhuman primates) imaging studies to achieve optimal CYP46A1 quantification for AD research. As specific goals, we will design and prepare a focused library of CYP46A1 modulators amenable for labeling with 11C or 18F, and evaluate their ability to quantify CYP46A1 activity and changes during drug challenge in rodents and nonhuman primates, as well as autoradiography and biological validation in postmortem human brain tissues. The impact of this work is not only to develop the first potent and selective CYP46A1 PET ligand for the study of AD-related biological processes, but also ultimately, via PET imaging validation in higher species, to advance this ligand for potential clinical translation and monitor target response of novel AD neurotherapeutics."
10798344,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the United States. Young MSM
(YMSM), particularly YMSM of color, have the highest HIV incidence of any group. Despite the perceived
safety of romantic relationships, main partnerships account for a large proportion of new HIV infections in MSM
(35-68%), and this proportion is much higher amongst YMSM. MSM substantially reduce condom and PrEP
use upon entry into a relationship, despite continued high risk for many couples. However, healthy romantic
relationships provide myriad benefits to individual health and wellbeing. Thus, we created 2GETHER, which
integrates evidence-based relationship education (e.g., communication, conflict resolution) and HIV prevention
(e.g., monogamy/non-monogamy agreements, behavioral/biomedical prevention), to optimize relationship
functioning and reduce HIV risk in male couples. 2GETHER demonstrated evidence of feasibility and
acceptability, as well as preliminary effects on HIV risk behaviors and relationship functioning, in a pilot trial.
We have also adapted 2GETHER for online administration, consisting of 3 online didactic skills modules and 2
videoconference-based skills coaching sessions, and are evaluating its efficacy in a randomized trial. Despite
its promise, we have identified several critical gaps in couple-based HIV prevention: 1) live skills coaching is
burdensome and not cost-effective, 2) many partnered MSM are unable to enroll partners and are thus
excluded, and 3) newer, high risk relationships rarely enroll in trials, so we need to deliver relationship skills to
single MSM before relationship initiation. Our goal is to upgrade 2GETHER into a scalable and tailored
intervention package for both single and partnered MSM, consisting of: 1) a standalone relationship education
and HIV prevention eHealth program (“eRE”) for single and partnered MSM, and 2) two additional dyadic skills
coaching sessions (for MSM participating as dyads only). Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of the tailored 2GETHER
intervention package on HIV incidence in MSM. We will enroll 5,000 HIV-negative MSM to test effectiveness of
the entirety of the 2GETHER tailored intervention package on HIV incidence at 24-months post-intervention
relative to control. We will also explore effects of particular tailored elements: (a) examine differential
effectiveness between single and partnered MSM; (b) among partnered MSM, analyze the additive benefit of
dyadic skills coaching sessions beyond the automated eRE program. Aim 2: Explore differential effects across
treatment arms among subgroups of MSM. We will explore differential effects across treatment arm by age,
race/ethnicity, rurality, and transgender experience. Aim 3: Research the implementation of 2GETHER
nationally to inform scale out and determine cost. Employing a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness–Implementation
Trial design, we will use mixed methods to identify facilitators and barriers to implementation. We will measure
key implementation determinants and outcomes through in-depth interviews with national stakeholders to
inform future implementation strategies, and conduct cost analysis to estimate cost of program implementation."
10839970,"Project Summary/Abstract
Numerous studies show the mechanisms by which sickle cell disease (SCD) induces vasculopathy and
increases vasocongestion are complex and multifactorial. In this revised, renewal application, we hypothesize
that SCD induces vasculopathy as one of the first steps in the mechanism by which SCD increases vaso-
occlusion. Our studies show that SCD induces a destructive cycle that is initiated by MPO and propagated by
high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), and one other inflammatory component that alters pulmonary physiology,
impairs vascular function, and increases vasocongestion.
Previously, we reported L-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC) inhibits MPO, improves vascular function and
reduces liver injury induced by excessive vasocongestion in SCD mice. New studies suggest that KYC not only
reduces sickle RBC (sRBC) congestion but also increases the number of round sRBC in the lungs of SCD mice.
Mechanistic studies reveal that KYC isn't just an inhibitor of MPO toxic oxidant production, but rather, is a unique
tripeptide substrate that exploits MPO peroxidase activity to be converted into a novel anti-inflammatory agent
that inactivates HMGB1 and activates the cellular pathways that are responsible for antioxidant defense enzyme
expression in the lung. As KYC inhibits multiple inflammatory components in our hypothesized destructive cycle,
and even activates a component that mediates antioxidant gene expression, new studies using mechanistic
inhibitors are required for determine which components increase vasculopathy and vasocongestion in SCD.
While a systems pharmaceutical agent may be useful for treating multifactorial diseases, they cannot be used to
identify causal mechanisms directly. In this revised application, we hypothesize that SCD induces a destructive
cycle, mediated by at least three major components. Our working hypothesis is SCD induces a destructive cycle
that is composed of MPO, HMGB1 and a novel, dysregulate gene and together induce vasculopathy and
increase vasocongestion. By treating sickle mice, sickle MPO knockout (ko) mice, chimeric sickle Tamoxifen-
inducible HMGB1 ko mice and another chimeric sickle ko mice with highly selective mechanistic inhibitors we
will be able to determine if and the extent to which MPO, HMGB1 and the third gene product, alone and/or in
combination induces vasculopathy and increases vasocongestion. To assess vasculopathy, we will quantify
differences in pulmonary artery relaxation, pulmonary permeability, sRBC vasocongestion, and susceptibility of
each mouse strain to sRBC vasocongestion induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation injury (HRI) in Townes
homozygote sickle Hb (SS) wt SS Mpo ko mice, and chimeric SS novel gene ko mice. Our long-term goals are
to confirm the identities of each component and develop novel therapies aimed at improving vascular function
and reducing sRBC vasocongestion."
10837759,"PROJECT 3 – ABSTRACT
Antibodies transferred from the mother to the fetus are a central determinant of immunity during the first months
of life. They provide protection against infectious pathogens when the magnitude and avidity of infant antibody
responses are relatively low. On the other hand, maternal antibodies can decrease infant vaccine responses, a
phenomenon named vaccine interference. The mechanisms underlying antibody-dependent immunity against
pathogens and regulation of vaccine responses in early life remain poorly understood. This gap in knowledge
limits the rationale design of maternal immunization strategies providing optimal protection to young infants. The
overall aim of the project is to identify key biophysical (subclass and glycosylation profile) and functional features
(activation of innate immune effectors) of transferred maternal antibodies mediating pathogen control and
regulating vaccine responses in young infants. The project is focused on the two model pathogens selected for
the whole program, pertussis and influenza. A systems serology approach will be used to characterize the
functional properties of maternal antibodies transferred to the newborn following immunization during pregnancy
and the impact of maternal immunization on the quality of infant vaccine responses. Engineering of human
antibodies and adoptive transfer to genetically deficient and humanized mice will be used to determine the role
of specific biophysical features of transferred maternal antibodies and of their interactions with infant IgG Fc
receptors and complement in the control of pathogens and in the regulation of vaccine responses. Synergizing
with Projects 1 and 2, Project 3 will provide mechanistic insight in the functional implications of the regulation of
vaccine responses by pregnancy, the selective transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta and their
decay after birth for immunity to pathogens in infancy. Synergizing with project 4, project 3 will define the
functional implications of the interactions between transferred maternal antibodies and the infant immune system
for vaccine responses in infancy. The knowledge gained through the project will provide unprecedented insight
in the immunobiology of maternal and infant immunization and will inform the development of vaccines and
monoclonal antibodies providing optimal protection against infectious diseases in early life."
10837763,"PROJECT 4 – MATERNAL-INFANT SYSTEMS IMMUNOLOGY – ABSTRACT
Infant mortality due to infection accounts for ~20% of the ~3 million neonatal deaths per year worldwide. It is
increasingly apparent that a two-pronged strategy can be highly effective in reducing infant mortality: 1) maternal
immunization during pregnancy to protect newborns during the first months of life when infection vulnerability is
the highest, 2) infant immunizations to provide subsequent early-life immunity. Designing effective vaccines is
challenging because the rules for inducing protective immunity are poorly understood. Many factors also
contribute to vaccine response variability across individuals and populations, including age, sex, genetics, and
pre-existing immunity. In particular, the environment, exposure history, and other variables can establish
baseline immune “set points” that impact responses, as we have shown for multiple vaccines in humans that
highlighted the importance of the plasmacytoid dendritic cell—Type I Interferon (INF-I) axis as a set point.
Vaccine response variability is particularly understudied in pregnant women and infants. Pregnancy and infancy
are accompanied by dynamic changes in immune and physiologic parameters that are only beginning to be
defined. How these processes impact immune set points including the IFN-I pathway and subsequent innate and
adaptive responses to vaccines in the mother and the resulting transferred immunity to infants represent a major
knowledge gap; how transferred immunity such as maternal antibodies (Abs) impacts infant set points to shape
vaccine responses remains unknown. Addressing these gaps are critical for designing improved vaccines for the
maternal-infant dyad. Here, we propose to comprehensively measure the state of single peripheral immune cells
before (at baseline) and after vaccination during pregnancy (Aim 1) and infancy (Aim 2) at unprecedented
resolution using multi-modal single cell profiling technologies to uncover baseline set point and early-response
cellular predictors and determinants of serological outcomes in the maternal-infant dyad. Machine learning will
be used to link single-cell phenotypes with “systems serology” parameters measured in Projects 1-3, including
Ab responses during pregnancy, the level and repertoire of Abs transferred from mothers to infants, and Ab
profiles of infants pre- and post-vaccination. Ab features beyond titers such as glycosylation, subclasses, Fc
receptor binding and effector functions will be included in these analyses. Parallel studies and mechanistic
dissection in mouse models (funded “in kind” by the NIH Intramural Program) using single cell and spatial tissue
imaging approaches will be integrated. The anticipated outcome is the discovery and understanding of
transcriptional and epigenetic circuits and phenotypes in immune cells, particularly those along the IFN-I axis,
that predict and orchestrate serological responses in the mother-infant dyad. This information will fill in critical
knowledge gaps to enable the design of effective vaccines specifically for pregnancy and infancy."
10824252,"Cell-cell communication plays a central role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis and its
deregulation leads to human diseases including birth defects and cancers. Therefore, understanding how
extracellular signals are transduced and integrated to control cell proliferation and differentiation during
development, tissue homeostasis and regeneration is of central importance in biomedical research. The
overarching goal of this team is to understand how signaling networks control organ development and
regeneration, with an emphasis on Hedgehog (Hh), Hippo, and BMP signaling pathways. Hh signaling
controls many key developmental processes in species ranging from Drosophila to human and its abnormal
activity has been implicated in numerous human cancers including medulloblastoma and basal cell
carcinoma. Hh acts through a conserved signaling cascade emanating from the GPCR family receptor
Smoothened (Smo) to the Zn-finger transcription factor Ci/Gli but how Smo activates Ci/Gli is still poorly
understood. In this proposal, the team will combine genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and biophysical
approaches to explore conserved mechanisms governing Smo trafficking, phosphorylation-dependent and -
independent activation of Ci/Gli, and the molecular links between Smo and Ci/Gli. The Hippo pathway was
initially discovered in Drosophila and plays a conserved role in the control of tissue growth and organ size by
simultaneously regulating cell proliferation and survival. Deregulation of Hippo signaling has also been
implicated in many types of human cancer. Despite its central importance in development and diseases, the
mechanisms underlying Hippo pathway regulation under physiological conditions or deregulation under
pathological conditions remain incompletely understood. The team has developed a genetic modifier screen
allowing them to identify novel and evolutionarily conserved Hippo pathway regulators. The team will continue
to investigate the mechanisms by which the newly identified components regulate Hippo pathway activity in
organ size control and tissue regeneration. The team has pioneered the use of Drosophila adult intestine as
a model system to investigate how stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated
during tissue homeostasis and regeneration, and identified Hippo, Hh and BMP signaling as essential for the
regulation of stem cell activity. In the previous funding period, the team has also established Drosophila adult
intestine as a model to study in vivo reprogramming after injury and began to explore the molecular
underpinning. In the proposed study, the team will investigate how other cell extrinsic and intrinsic factors
acts in conjunction with BMP signaling to promote stem cell self-renewal and explore the genetic and cellular
mechanisms that control the reprogramming of fully differentiated cells to adult stem cells in response to
injury. The knowledge gained from this study will have important implications for developmental biology,
cancer biology, and regenerative medicine."
10836984,"Abstract
A hallmark of emphysema is the net loss of cells that form alveolar units required for gas exchange, due to
increased injury and impaired cell repair caused by inhalation of cigarette smoking (CS). Our proposal will
focus on how to enhance the survival and repair of lung microvascular endothelial cells, which are essential for
the maintenance of the alveolo-capillary membrane. To survive stress, injured cells engage a repair process,
autophagy, characterized by a sequence of steps (flux) devoted to the lysosomal degradation of damaged
proteins and organelles. Despite progress made in linking autophagy with COPD, little is known as to how CS
disrupts autophagic flux and approaches to restore its proper function are lacking. We propose to fill this
knowledge gap, by elucidating the regulation of lysosomal fitness and autophagic flux by sphingolipid
metabolites during homeostasis and CS exposure. We uncovered two sphingolipid rheostats (sphingosine/S1P
and ceramide/glucosylceramide) that control the autophagy flux, but are disturbed by CS. We hypothesize that
restoration of the sphingolipid rheostat is required to complete lysosomal autophagy and repair cigarette
smoke-induced lung microvascular endothelial cell injury and will alleviate emphysema. We will use
complementary approaches of human lung primary endothelial cells in 2D and 3D models of repair, including
co-cultured with alveolar type II epithelial cells, human precision cut lung slices, and mouse models of CS
exposure, to pursue three specific aims. Completion of these aims will fill important knowledge gaps in
emphysema pathogenesis, will mechanistically link targeted metabolomics with functional outcomes, and
provide potential new targets for treatment of emphysema."

Project Summary/Abstract
Injury accounts for 47% of deaths in Americans ages 1-46, and is associated with an annual $672 billion cost
in healthcare expenses and lost productivity. Injury outstrips cancer, diabetes, and heart disease in prevalence
and cost (1-2). There remains vast inequity in access to quality injury care, with an estimated one-in-five
trauma deaths being preventable. The current state of affairs for trauma knowledge transfer leaves many
trauma providers with inadequate access to up-to-date, resource-relevant, user-friendly, trustworthy clinical
guidance. The public domain contains redundancy and gaps in the existing clinical practice guidance, which is
developed primarily by and often primarily for, academic level I trauma centers, without representation of
geography, discipline, or cultural diversity in origin or applicability. The 2016 National Academies of Science,
Engineering and Medicine report on a national trauma care system acknowledged that a “lack of formal,
funded mechanisms for coordination, communication, and translation in trauma care has…contributed…to
suboptimal outcomes for injured patients in the United States (5).”
The three-year conference series, Design for Implementation: The Future of Trauma Research and Guidance
will apply best practices from dissemination and implementation science, Agile team facilitation, and adult
learning theories to inclusively engage stakeholders in order to better understand user needs, and to ultimately
develop a national strategy for clinical guidance development and dissemination. The conference will leverage
the expertise, perspective, and position of leaders and end-users with global expertise in dissemination and
implementation science, hospital administration, development, clinical care, informatics and patient experience.
The conference series will follow implementation science principles in structure, with each year having an
education, data acquisition, and execution focus. The first year will focus on context inquiry and stakeholder
engagement, second on perceptual implementation outcomes (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility), and
the final year on behavioral implementation outcomes (adoption, fidelity, sustainability). The conference series
is intended to inform development of a national plan, for which additional funding, such as a Dissemination
Practice grant, will be sought.

10834885,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus underlying the current COVID-19 pandemic, not only affects peripheral tissues, it also
targets the brain causing microvascular lesions, microhemorrhages and neurological manifestations. The
internalization of SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by the binding of the virus spike protein to angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the membrane of host cells including endothelial cells throughout cerebral capillaries.
ACE2 is internalized along with the virus thereby leading to a state of ACE2 deficiency. ACE2 is a critical member
of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This enzyme catabolizes the octapeptide hormone angiotensin-[1-8]
thereby protecting cells and tissues from the vasoconstrictor, pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of
overactive angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1Rs). Blocking AT1Rs with an AT1R antagonist protects mice from
behavioral impairments due to ACE2 deficiency. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes microglia activation and
neuronal cell loss and is widely used as an experimental model of neuroinflammation. The brain pathophysiology
induced by LPS shares many similarities with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesize that under conditions of
reduced ACE2 (i.e., ACE2 knockout mice or SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters), AT1R activity is upregulated in
the microvasculature. In the presence of an inflammatory insult (i.e., LPS or SARS-CoV-2), AT1Rs promote
endothelial dysfunction in the microvasculature through pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic signaling pathways
leading to blood brain barrier injury. Deficits in cognition and increased anxiety ensue. We will test this overall
hypothesis through the following specific aims: Determine the mechanisms of the pro-injury (Aim 1) and
protective (Aim 2) arms of the RAS that regulate the pathophysiology of the brain in animal models of
neuroinflammation and COVID-19. (Aim 3) Determine the mechanisms underlying the effects of biological sex
and age in the brain pathophysiology induced by LPS and SARS-CoV-2. Studying RAS mechanisms in the brain
will provide insight into on-going and future clinical trials of therapeutics for treating brain injury associated with
COVID-19 and other diseases of neuroinflammation. In addition, focusing on mechanisms underlying the effects
of biological sex and age on microvasculature pathophysiology in models of neuroinflammation and COVID-19
will shed light into why male sex and age are major risk factors for COVID-19 severity."
10873042,"Sedentary behavior is engaging in activities in the seated or lying position that barely raise the energy
expenditure above the resting metabolic rate and is a risk factor for obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
and mortality. However, it is unlikely that moderate/ vigorous intensity physical activities could be an effective
replacement for sedentary activities for persons with CKD as most otherwise healthy Americans do not even
reach the current goals for these activities. Therefore, in a NIDDK funded pilot and feasibility RCT
(R21DK106574, PI: Beddhu), we tested, the feasibility of a `Sit Less, Interact, Move More (SLIMM)'
intervention to replace sedentary activities with casual stepping activities in 106 participants with CKD. In the
SLIMM group, the maximum decrease in sedentary duration (-43.0, 95% CI --69.0 to -17.0 min/day) and
increase in stepping duration (15.5, 95% CI 6.9 to 24.1 min/day) and the number of steps/day (1265, 95% CI
518 to 2012) were seen at week 20 but attenuated at week 24. In post-hoc, descriptive analyses, higher
baseline physical function as evidenced by 6-min walk distance and lower baseline body fat% measured by
bio-impedance appeared to be associated with achieving SLIMM intervention goals in the SLIMM group.
 Based on our observations in the SLIMM pilot study, we propose a complex interplay between sedentary
behavior, impaired physical function and obesity that leads to a vicious cycle that perpetuates sedentary
behavior in CKD. Therefore, a successful intervention for sedentary behavior will need to incorporate co-
interventions targeting obesity and impaired physical function. Specifically, we propose the addition of guided
resistance training to increase physical function and semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor
agonist that has been shown to decrease adiposity and inflammation and improve health related quality of life.
 Herein we seek to implement SLIMM intervention alone for the first three months followed by a 9 month
RCT of three equal groups of SLIMM + standard of care RT + placebo, SLIMM + guided RT + placebo and
SLIMM + guided RT + oral semaglutide in 156 overweight or obese patients with moderate to advanced CKD.
The designated primary endpoint is decrease in sedentary duration and the key secondary endpoint is six-
minute walk distance. We will also explore the effects of the interventions on body-fat%, patient reported
outcomes, lower extremity performance battery and markers of inflammation.
 There is a large pool of potential participants in the two institutions. The study is adequately powered to
detect meaningful decrease in sedentary duration and other endpoints. This multi-disciplinary team of
experienced investigators have a proven track record of successfully conducting RCTs. This proposal is
feasible, innovative, and likely to yield results that will be informative. If the interventions decrease
sedentary behavior in CKD, this trial will pave the way for larger RCTs of sedentary behavior interventions on
hard endpoints."

Importance: Despite the emergence of virtual care (VC) programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
sustainability of these programs is unknown because of concerns relating to health access disparities, future
payment parity, effective integration into clinical workflows, and the misalignment of many of the goals of VC
integration with a fee-for-service payment environment. Lack of access to Real-World VC Data and knowledge
of the unique needs of different VC stakeholder groups exacerbates health disparities and can impede
attaining financial sustainability. Similarly, there is no consensus on evidence-based research measurements
specific to VC, which hinders the effectiveness and sustainability of VC
Objective: Lay strong foundation for future adoption and dissemination of VC research capabilities.
Specific aims: (1) Build and promote a productive coalition of internal and external resources, thought leaders
and stakeholder representatives to enable the use of Real-World VC Data and to generate innovative and
pragmatic approaches to advance scalable equity and value in VC both locally and nationally.
(2) Assess the facilitators and barriers for key stakeholders to achieve equitable and sustainable VC by
conducting two rounds of semi-structured interviews.
(3) Develop and validate consensus around VC Equity and Value frameworks (e.g., outcome metrics) that will
accelerate future translational research and provide evidence-based guidance for VC service and policy.
(4) Train workforce to implement validated VC Equity and Value frameworks to improve human health.
Center Activities: ViVE will continuously grow by learning from conducting its research and supporting the
research of others. To the extent, ViVE will create new infrastructure and provide access to Real-World VC
Research Data and VC Expertise that will support and advance VC research. ViVE will assess the facilitators
and barriers to achieving equitable and sustainable VC from key stakeholders using semi-structured
interviews. Additionally, ViVE will shift the current status quo of VC research by building consensus around VC
equity and value frameworks. To ensure the effective implementation of these frameworks, ViVE will conduct
workforce training sessions to improve the knowledge and skills required to implement VC frameworks.
Expected outcomes: On successful completion of our research, we expect contributions to include (1)
accelerating NC TraCS (UNC CTSA) clinical and translational science by expediting the development of a VC
research hub, (2) developing a VC coalition that advances translational VC research by enabling researchers
to access Real-World VC Data, resources, and expertise, (3) building and validating VC measurement
approaches and outcomes metrics for equity and value, and (4) demonstrating real-world utility of validated
outcomes and measurements through implementation in clinical research studies.

10848255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to describe the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which cells sense the presence of DNA damage and how they repair
chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs). Primarily using budding yeast as a model system, it
is possible to induce site-specific DSBs with a high degree of synchrony that is not generally
possible in mammalian cells, allowing “in vivo biochemistry” approaches to monitor intermediate
steps in DSB repair and DNA damage signaling. We also wish to apply our understanding of DNA
repair and recombination mechanisms to elucidate how the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia
burgdorferi, is able to “change its coat” by repeated gene conversion events.
The goals for the next five years of this project focus on understanding how homologous donor
sequences are found and used to repair a DSB and how mismatches are tolerated and repaired
during different steps of recombination. A second objective is to understand the basis of the 1000-
fold increase in mutations associated with DSB repair and how microhomologies are used in
repair-dependent template switching, creating complex chromosome rearrangements analogous
to events recently found in human cancers. We employ similar approaches to elucidating how
CRISPR/as9-mediated gene editing is accomplished using single-stranded DNA templates. A
third area of concern is to understand how the DNA damage checkpoint is regulated. We wish to
determine how the DNA damage response affects DSB repair and how the DNA damage
checkpoint is maintained and turned off. These studies will provide new insights and guidance in
defining the DSB repair and checkpoint signaling in human cells.
Finally, we will continue our investigation of the mechanisms by which Borrelia initiates and
mediates gene conversion events between one expressed gene and a set of adjacent
pseudogenes."

Recent highthroughput exome sequencing has revealed various somatic mutations in individuals with clonal
hematopoiesis (CH) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. Among these mutations, C-to-T
mutations is among the most common type of single mutations observed in CH and MDS. It remains yet to be
explained why C-to-T mutations are preferentially enriched in CH and MDS and how the C-to-T transition alters
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) fitness and leads to aberrant clonal expansion. By combining
in vitro biochemical and structural analyses with epigenomic profiling of bone marrow samples from MDS
patients, the team discovered a previously-underappreciated mutual reinforcement between C-to-T transition
and genomic binding of transcription factors (TFs), which contributes to the clonal expansion of HSPCs and
aggravate CH and MDS. In Aim1, the team will use genetically-modified mouse models and CRISPR/Cas9-
based genome editing methods to probe the causality between C-to-T transition and TF binding in HSPCs. In
Aim 2, the team will test how the C-to-T transition and DNA methylation deregulation reshape the genomic
distribution of TFs, subsequently altering downstream transcriptional outputs to cause clonal expansion in
HSPCs. In parallel, the team will use HSPCs purified from CH and MDS patients to further validate findings
made ex vivo and in rodent models. The proposed studies are anticipated to significantly advance our
mechanistic understanding on how TFs shape the genome and how somatic mutations alter transcriptional
regulation in HSPCs. From a translational perspective, discoveries made from this study will lead to the
identification of therapeutic vulnerabilities for CH and MDS treatment."

ASXL1 is an epigenetic regulatory protein that is frequently mutated in myelodysplastic
syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Mutations in ASXL1 are associated with
treatment resistance and poor prognosis. ASXL1 mutations are highly enriched in CSF3R-
mutant myeloproliferative neoplasms, disorders characterized by an increased production of
neutrophils. Despite the high frequency of ASXL1 mutations and association with poor
prognosis, there is little known about the function of ASXL1 in normal or abnormal neutrophil
production. Through single cell RNA sequencing, we identified an essential role for ASXL1 in
normal neutrophil development. In this context, deletion of ASXL1 perturbs RNA polymerase II
function and activates a Myc signaling network in the neutrophil progenitor population. The goal
of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms by which ASXL1 controls the neutrophil
developmental program, and to understand how truncating mutations in ASXL1 contribute to the
biology of myeloproliferative disorders. Our long-term objective is to use this mechanistic
understanding to develop therapeutic interventions that reverse the defects in neutrophil
development associated with ASXL1 mutations."
10802367,"Ether-a-go-go (EAG) potassium selective channels are important regulators of neuronal
excitability and cancer progression. Defects in EAG channel function are associated
with neurological disorders and cancer. Despite the physiological importance of EAG
channels, molecular mechanisms of EAG channel regulation by intracellular ligands and
clinically relevant EAG channel regulators are not known. The goal of this proposal is to
uncover molecular mechanisms of EAG channel regulation by intracellular ligands
recently discovered by our laboratory and to determine a therapeutic potential of these
ligands for treatment of diseases linked to EAG channels. In Specific Aim 1 we plan to
solve X-ray structures of the intracellular Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) and cyclic nucleotide-
binding homology (CNBH) domains of EAG channels bound to the recently identified
ligands and conduct computational simulations of the ligand binding to the PAS and
CNBH domains to uncover the structural basis of EAG channel regulation by the
intracellular ligands. The structural findings will be then used as a road map to guide
functional experiments on the molecular mechanisms of EAG channel regulation by the
ligands. In Specific Aim 2 we plan to use surface plasmon resonance method to identify
novel EAG channel ligands that affect channel function through PAS and CNBH domain
interface. We will then use electrophysiology to determine functional implications of
strengthening or weakening of the PAS/CNBH domain interface by the identified
regulators on the function of EAG channels. In Specific Aim 3 we plan to use tissue
culture and zebrafish xenograft models to test therapeutic potential of the identified
regulators for treatment of cancer. The results of these studies will be crucial for
understanding fundamental regulatory mechanisms of EAG and related ERG and ELK
channels, and for attaining therapeutic potential of EAG channel regulators."

The sense of smell is essential for maintaining full human health and quality of life. It plays an
important role in the detection of environmental dangers as well guiding decisions such as what
foods to eat. However, olfactory processing is influenced by the physiological state of an organism.
Both sleep deprivation and changes in satiety are connected with changes in the function of the
olfactory system. Physiological changes such as these are integrated in the hypothalamus, where
different neuropeptides are expressed by specific populations of neurons. These peptides can
regulate transitions between wakefulness and sleep, or promote feeding behaviors. One peptide
that functions in both promoting feeding and sleep is melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH).
Neurons expressing MCH project to several areas of the brain including the olfactory bulb (OB),
where the MCH receptor, MCHR1, is expressed. This connection represents a previously
understudied pathway providing a potential mechanism for sleep or satiety induced changes in
olfactory function. The proposed research will investigate the role of MCH signaling and
hypothalamic MCH neurons in contributing to odor processing. The aims of this proposal will test
the central hypothesis centrifugal MCH neurons integrate physiological states and regulate
olfactory function. Aim 1 will use molecular and biochemical techniques to investigate changes in
MCH levels in the OB in response to food restriction. It will also use complementary mouse
models to determine the cellular targets of hypothalamic MCH neurons in olfactory regions. Aim
2 will investigate the effects of MCH on the activity of mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, and how
changes in MCH effect odor threshold detection and cross-habituation in animals that lack
components of the MCH signaling pathway. It will also test how activation of hypothalamic MCH
neurons modulates these behaviors. Using AAV mediated approaches, we will target MCHR1
removal specifically in the OB to isolate its contribution to regulating behavioral changes. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will investigate how disruption of primary cilia, the cellular site of MCHR1
localization, on neurons in the OB impacts an animal's ability to detect and discriminate odors.
Completion of the proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insight into the role of the lateral
hypothalamus in regulating olfactory function. The results from the proposed research will be
important for understanding how changes in satiety or in wakefulness can impact the sense of
smell. It will also provide insight into mechanisms of sensory dysfunction that occur in some
ciliopathy patients. Completion of this project will establish future experiments to address the
molecular mechanisms of MCH modulation in the OB."

In the US, an estimated 3.3 million children experience dizziness and balance problems (19). Children with
congenital vestibular disorders (CVDs) show delayed motor development and challenges in maintaining posture
and balance, indicating that the vestibular neural circuitry is affected. Computed tomography (CT) shows that
children with CVDs most commonly form a sac-like inner ear with the semicircular canals missing or truncated.
It is not known how their vestibular connectivity is altered. We hypothesize that formation of a sac-like inner ear
during early gestation results in a reduced number of vestibular ganglion cells forming fewer primary vestibular
synapses on hair cells peripherally and on vestibular nuclei neurons centrally, leading to underconnectivity in the
vestibular system. We further hypothesize that the sac-like inner ear pathology results in abnormal convergence
of canal and otolith fibers onto vestibular nuclei neurons, or anomalous connectivity, contributing to abnormal
signal processing in these neurons. The proposed work will establish a framework to test the overarching
hypothesis that formation of a congenitally-malformed, sac-like inner ear alters the peripheral and
central vestibular neural circuitry. To address these questions, our laboratory has implemented and validated
a new chick embryo model. We can produce a reproducible animal model in 85% of cases by surgically rotating
the developing inner ear or “otocyst” 180° on one side in two-day old chick embryos (E2). Since the procedure
involves Anterior-posterior axis Rotation of the Otocyst to produce a Sac-like inner ear, the model is called the
ARO/s chick. The sac-like inner ear of ARO/s chicks resembles the sac-like inner ear in children with CVDs.
After hatching (H), ARO/s chicks experience challenges in maintaining balance and walking. As a first step in
understanding the consequences of the sac-like inner ear on the developing vestibular neural circuitry, in
Specific Aim 1 we will further analyze the vestibular epithelium and quantify vestibular ganglion cells to
determine to what extent primary vestibular afferent synapses are decreased in ARO/s chicks. In Specific Aim
2, we will combine imaging and electrophysiological approaches to determine whether a structurally-uniform
class of vestibular nuclei neurons, the principal cells of the tangential nucleus (TN), acquire the orderly inputs
from canal and otolith fibers, passive and active membrane properties, and synaptic transmission found in normal
chicks. In Specific Aim 3, we will perform ethological tests to characterize posture and balance in H5 ARO/s
chicks, followed by the horizontal vestibuloocular reflex (hVOR) using Earth vertical axis rotation (EVAR) to test
canal function and the static tilting platform test to evaluate otolith function. The experimental outcomes will
provide a foundation to better understand the pathological changes occurring in the vestibular neural circuitry of
CVD patients, and modify our thinking on how to treat these disorders."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most common cause of mortality in HIV+
individuals. Although antiretroviral and antimycobacterial drugs have reduced the burden of TB in the HIV+
population, they are incompletely effective against this global health burden. The only available TB vaccine is
the live attenuated mycobacterium Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) that is given intradermally to infants. While
this provides substantial protection against non-pulmonary TB in childhood, it has little impact on pulmonary TB
rates in adults. However, we have shown recently that BCG delivered intravenously (BCG IV) conferred dramatic
protection from TB in SIV-negative macaques.
Dr. Scanga conducted a preliminary study of BCG IV in his macaque model of HIV/Mtb co-infection. Animals
infected with pathogenic SIV for several months that were then co-infected with virulent Mtb exhibited more
severe TB than did similarly-infected SIV-naïve animals. In their preliminary study, vaccination of SIV+ macaques
with BCG IV induced immunity that parallels that seen in SIV-naïve rhesus and conferred dramatic protection
from TB in 6/7 animals. Furthermore, there were no signs of disseminated BCG. This unprecedented
protection from TB in SIV+ animals provides exciting evidence that BCG IV can be safe, immunogenic,
and protective in NHP with chronic SIV infection
While these data are provocative, there is still much to learn about the mechanisms by which BCG IV provides
such striking protection. In this R01 proposal, we will extend these exciting results to refine the ability of BCG
IV to protect SIV+ macaques from infection with Mtb. Most importantly, we will use comprehensive
immunologic approaches, both biased and unbiased, to determine the immune correlates and mechanisms
of BCG IV-mediated protection against TB in the context of pre-existing SIV. This will demonstrate that it
may indeed be possible to protect persons infected with HIV from TB and will guide the development of TB
vaccine approaches that can protect this highly vulnerable population.
The team we have assembled includes experts in the field of TB, vaccines, and the cutting-edge technologies
that will allow us to understand better the remarkable protection of SIV+ animals with BCG IV. We already have
an established collaborative relationship and ensures successful completion of this very exciting study."
10708141,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Severe hypoglycemia remains a common and life-threatening issue for patients living with type 1 diabetes
(T1D). Research has consistently shown that patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH), which
typically coexists with a diminished counterregulatory response (CRR), are at the highest risk for severe
hypoglycemia. However, we currently do not have clinically available tools to identify patients with IAH, and
even if identified, we lack interventions to reduce their risk. The ultimate goal of this research is to address
these large, unmet needs. Specifically, we plan to utilize continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to identify
which CGM metrics are associated with IAH and a diminished CRR (AIM 1). We will then determine if modern
T1D management with hybrid closed loop (HCL) systems can restore hypoglycemia awareness (AIM 2).
AIM 1: Identify the CGM metrics associated with hypoglycemia awareness
Our first hypothesis is that time below range (TBR) by CGM will inversely correlate with epinephrine AUC
during a hypoglycemic clamp. This hypothesis is strongly supported by our preliminary data detailed in our
research strategy. To test this hypothesis, we propose that the consortium enroll a total of 112 subjects with
T1D. Subjects will wear a blinded CGM for 10 days prior to a hypoglycemic clamp. Data to be collected will
include counterregulatory hormones during hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia symptom scores (Edinburgh), and
hypoglycemic awareness questionnaires (Clarke, Gold, Pederson, and hypo A-Q) as we have previously done.
CGM metrics will be correlated with CRR, symptom scores, and currently used questionnaires to define
awareness. The study design will determine which CGM metrics predict hypoglycemia awareness and CRR.
AIM 2: Determine if hypoglycemia awareness can be restored in individuals with T1D using up-to-date
management of diabetes
Our second hypothesis is that reducing TBR using modern diabetes management with HCL systems will
improve awareness of hypoglycemia and the CRR. To test this hypothesis, all 112 subjects will be randomized
1:1 to either a control arm or a hypoglycemia reduction arm for 2 years. In the control arm, all insulin delivery
methods will be allowed and CGM targets will follow current standards of care that allow up to 4% TBR (~1
hour/day). The hypoglycemia avoidance arm will provide all patients with a HCL system and target <1% TBR.
Hypoglycemic clamps will be conducted at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 with 10 days of blinded
CGM prior to each clamp. The primary outcome will be the difference in epinephrine AUC during
hypoglycemic clamp between study arms. This study design will determine if up-to-date T1D management can
restore the CRR and hypoglycemia awareness."

High affinity pancreatic islet-reactive B cells contribute to young onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) disease
progression, but are rare in the peripheral blood, and therefore, difficult to study. Hence, little is known regarding
the phenotype and function of diabetogenic B cells in T1D. Recent developments in single cell RNA sequencing
methods have enabled simultaneous collection of gene expression, B and T cell receptor (BCR/TCR) V(D)J
clonotype, protein expression (CITE-seq), and functional data from single cells. We have developed a method
called AVID-seq (Antigen Reactivity and V(D)J In Droplets by Sequencing) to enable detection and
characterization of relevant antigen-binding cells from polyclonal repertoires that can be multiplexed using
standard single cell droplet sequencing methods. We hypothesize that, unlike healthy control subjects,
young onset T1D subjects will exhibit a loss of anergic islet-reactive B cells and a corresponding
increase in activated, high affinity, effector-like islet-reactive B cells in their peripheral blood. Aim 1 will
analyze islet-reactive B cells (i.e. insulin, GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8) from the peripheral blood of young new-onset
T1D and age/sex matched healthy controls using AVID-seq. It is expected that differential gene expression,
surface protein expression (CITE-Seq), and V(D)J sequence characteristics will identify an activated B cell
phenotype that is expanded in T1D donors, which likely contributes to disease. Aim 2 will determine the
relationship between B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen affinity and normalized counts of antigen bound per cell, as
determined by AVID-seq. This aim has the potential to significantly streamline current methods to determine
BCR-antigen affinities and discriminate pathogenic high affinity B cells from low affinity, likely non-pathogenic, B
cells. The potential impact of these studies lies in identification of the pathogenic B cells involved in young onset
T1D, which will inform future age-appropriate therapeutics. Along with these proposed studies, the applicant has
assembled a diverse team of experts to serve on her advisory committee, a comprehensive training and
development plan that is tailored to her needs, and a research environment that will foster her growth as a
predoctoral student."
10931329,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
With the rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the U.S. and worldwide, there is a crucial need for
preventative and disease-modifying treatments. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) serve as the gold
standard to determine whether a candidate treatment has a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for a pre-specified
target patient population. However, heterogeneity of treatment effects across subpopulations (e.g., due to
health disparities) may yield medical interventions that are not one-size-fits-all. Enrichment strategies are
commonly employed in RCTs to identify the target populations most likely to benefit from a candidate treatment
and/or have the outcome of interest during the course of the trial. Enrichment in AD RCTs aligns with the
National Plan to Address AD Strategy 1.B to expand research to develop disease-modifying treatments.
Currently, there is a gap in the understanding of RCTs using enrichment and adaptations to the randomized
treatment assignment allocations (response-adaptive enrichment), especially for RCTs with a repeated
measures (longitudinal, e.g., changes in activities of daily living scores) or censored (time-to-event, e.g., time
to dementia) primary outcome. Application of standard statistical methods to enrichment designs may,
however, result in bias (tendency to systematically over- or under- estimate treatment effects). Biased
estimates can lead to approval of less effective therapies, in the best case, and approval of potentially harmful
or ineffective therapies or missing an effective therapy, in the worst case, as a consequence of over- or under-
estimating treatment effects. Our conjecture is that the bias induced in a fixed enrichment pre-post (only two
assessments; one pre- and one post-randomization) RCT will be exacerbated when using response-adaptive
enrichment in longitudinal or time-to-event RCTs. The applicant’s long-term objective as a collaborator on
RCTs and independent researcher is to provide well-calibrated and valid statistical inference for complex
innovative designs to facilitate drug development in AD and other diseases. This F31 proposal aims to quantify
the impact of enrichment (e.g., on bias), and as needed, develop novel statistical methods to obtain valid
inference in enriched RCTs with a longitudinal primary outcome (Aim 1) and a time-to-event primary outcome
(Aim 2). Simulation studies using data from completed, large phase 3 NIA- and industry-sponsored mild
cognitive impairment and AD trials will be used to empirically validate the newly developed theory and methods
in real-world settings. To provide resources for trialists, freely-available and user-friendly software based on
Aims 1-2 will be developed (Aim 3) as an extension to the existing RCTdesign (www.rctdesign.org) R package,
co-authored by the sponsor of this application. Research findings from Aims 1-2 will be disseminated via
conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Successful completion of Aims 1-3 will provide a
framework and tools for trialists to be well-informed when designing enriched RCTs for any disease."

The precise etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown. Despite identification of >100
human genetic polymorphisms that are thought to play a role in IBD, genetic predisposition typically explains
only a fraction of disease risk. Important contributions for environmental factors—including diet and the gut
microbiota—have become prominent suspects as additional disease drivers. However, the functional
interconnections between these potential contributors remain unknown. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model, in
which animals were colonized with a synthetic human gut microbiota composed of fully sequenced and
metabolically characterized commensal bacteria, we have begun to elucidate the mechanistic interactions
between dietary fiber, the gut microbiota and the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as a primary defense
against encroachment by intestinal bacteria. During dietary fiber deficiency, the gut microbiota resorts to host-
secreted mucus glycoproteins as a nutrient source, leading to erosion of the mucus layer. Dietary fiber
deprivation, together with a fiber-deprived, mucus-eroding microbiota, promotes greater epithelial access and
lethal colitis by the mucosal pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. More strikingly, when this same synthetic
microbiota is assembled in mice deficient in interleukin 10 (IL-10), a cytokine for which loss of function defects
have been associated with human IBD, animals develop lethal spontaneous inflammation in the absence of an
overt pathogen, but only on a low fiber diet. Our work has therefore revealed functional interconnections
between diet, the gut microbiota, mucosal barrier function and spontaneous IBD development. Our central
hypothesis is that there is a dynamic balance between fiber- and mucus-degrading bacteria, such that in low
fiber conditions the mucus layer is increasingly eroded resulting in temporal disease progression that can be
ameliorated by preventative or therapeutic fiber consumption or other bacterial metabolites that counterbalance
inflammation. The proposed work will extend the findings outlined above by first measuring the respective
contributions of mucin-degrading bacteria and their functions towards eroding the mucosal barrier and
precipitating inflammation. We have already established that addition of several pure fibers to our fiber
deficient diet reduces disease and have fortuitously discovered that inclusion of soy (but not milk) protein also
reduces disease in part by promoting production of the branched chain fatty acid isobutyrate. Isobutyrate is
produced from L-valine and our hypothesis is that soy protein delivers a peptide-based source of this amino
acid to the colon for bacterial metabolism. Because isobutyrate is a poorly studied metabolite, we will
investigate its microbial source(s) and mechanism of action in dampening host inflammation. We anticipate
that our findings will provide functional insight into the constellation of genetic and environmental triggers that
conspire to precipitate IBD. As such, our findings will provide paths to future research in humans, which are
built on a foundation of functional knowledge of diet-microbiota interactions gathered in a tractable model."

 In this Industry-Academic Partnership R01 application, a multidisciplinary team of investigators from the
University of California at Davis, TargaGenix and Northeastern University are proposing to develop a highly
innovative combination treatment strategy for refractory tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA). The proposed studies will leverage multi-disciplinary expertise of scientists and clinicians to develop
effective PDA treatment paradigm based on the combination of TGX-1214 (a nanoemulsion of our lead next
generation taxoid DHA-SBT-1214) with immune checkpoint inhibition. In preliminary studies, our novel lead
agent DHA-SBT-1214 strongly inhibited pancreatic cancer growth in two preclinical models of pancreatic cancer
(complete tumor regression in both models). In addition, we have recently documented that the combination of
an anti-PD-L1 therapy with our novel chemotherapy drug DHA-SBT-1214 formulated in a nanoemulsion (TGX-
1214), significantly increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and enhanced the therapeutic effects of the anti-PD-L1
antibody in a pancreatic cancer syngeneic model. It is noteworthy that TGX-1214 alone on combined with an
anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy strongly reduced tumor growth to a higher extent than paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel
(Abraxane), gemcitabine, or single anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy groups. Moreover, in the clinically relevant KPC
genetically-engineered mouse model of PDA, TGX-1214 reduced tumor fibrosis and increased of CD8+ T-cell
infiltration. Importantly, TGX-1214 appears safe and present a high therapeutic window as indicated by GLP-
toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Thus, these results indicate that TGX-1214 is safe and effective in multiple
preclinical models of PDA; it stimulates the immunogenic potential of PDA and provides synergistic therapeutic
effects with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, warranting further evaluation. Our long-term goal is to develop
safe and effective treatment strategies for PDA to test in clinical trials and ultimately to be used in humans. Based
on these novel findings, we hypothesize that a combination of TGX-1214 and immune checkpoint antibody
therapy will provide superior efficacy with less toxicity. The specific aims of the study are: (1): To evaluate tumor-
specific delivery, biodistribution, tumor stromal density modulation, and immune cell infiltration of TGX-1214 in
clinically relevant animal models of PDA; (2): To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of the TGX-1214
along with anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy in two clinically relevant PDA animal models (orthotopically grafted
pancreatic tumor organoids and KPC mice), and (3): To determine the efficacy of TGX-1214 as monotherapy in
patients with treatment-refractory PDA. At the completion of these studies, we expect that TGX-1214 in
combination with cancer immunotherapy, will become part of the personalized medicine revolution that is only
now beginning and will become a significant part of the future treatment paradigms to eliminate the burden of
PDA, providing positive benefits in long-term treatment outcomes."
10893928,"Social cognition is a fundamental process essential for species survival. Disturbances in social processing have
been identified by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Initiative as a major domain disrupted across psychiatric
disorders including neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD
prevalence continues to increase at an alarming rate, affecting 1 in 54 U.S. children, and characterized by an
unexplained sexual dimorphism. While ASD has a strong genetic component, the disorder is in most cases,
multifactorial, resulting from sex-specific genetic susceptibilities interacting with environmental factors during
critical developmental periods. Thus environmental exposures, including exposures to endocrine disrupting
chemicals (EDCs), may contribute to the rising prevalence of ASD. However, experimental evidence has not
established a direct link with specific chemicals and mechanisms remain elusive. PBDEs are commercial flame
retardants found in human breast milk that are associated with developmental deficits in children. Our lab has
shown that the commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, produces ASD-relevant phenotypes that include deficient
social recognition memory, exaggerated repetitive behavior, and altered neuromolecular profiles for the social
neuropeptides, oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin, and their receptors. PBDEs structurally resemble thyroid
hormones (TH), which are both critical for neurodevelopment of social brain circuits and regulate OXT and AVP.
Therefore, I will test the novel hypothesis that developmental PBDEs produce a hypothyroid state, which disrupts
signaling in the central OXTergic system and malformation of social neural circuits leading to deficient
socioemotional behavior. In mechanistic studies under Aim 1, I will examine the TH targets of PBDEs and the
contribution of TH disruption to altered behavior and neuropeptide phenotypes of PBDE-exposed male and
female offspring using maternal thyroid supplementation. Chemogenetic activation of OXT release within the
PVN will be employed in an attempt to rescue PBDE-induced abnormal phenotypes. In circuit-level studies using
retrograde tract-tracing under Aim 2, I will examine PBDE reprogramming of the reciprocal preflimbic cortex to
basolateral amygdala circuit, which is critical for social recognition ability. Since this circuit depends on OXT
receptor (OXTR) signaling and is purported to receive OXTergic projections from PVN, I will determine if
developmental intranasal OXT rescues structural changes produced by PBDEs. These studies will investigate
the neurodevelopmental effects of maternal transfer of PBDEs across multiple levels of biological organization
and developmental ages to begin to understand mechanisms and critical windows of risk. My findings will provide
critical mechanistic information necessary to break through gaps in knowledge about the possible environmental
risk to NDDs. They will also inform about the role of oxytocin underlying social and emotion recognition behavior
and the mechanisms altering circuit-level function during neurodevelopment. Finally, the findings may eventually
translate to the development of alternative therapeutic approaches to treat psychosocial NDDs."
10750959,"Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) are Gram-positive bacteria responsible for 1.6 million deaths
globally each year. Available pneumococcal vaccines have reduced efficacy in the elderly, and despite
vaccination, S. pneumoniae remain the leading cause of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in adults over
the age of 65. This decline in vaccine efficacy is driven by immunosenescence, the age-associated decline in
immune function. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are cells of the innate immune system and are required
for host defense against S. pneumoniae infection. PMNs isolated from aged hosts display a significant reduction
in pneumococcal killing when compared to PMNs from young hosts. This reduction in killing persists despite
opsonization of bacteria with specific anti-pneumococcal antibodies, however, the signaling pathways driving
this decline in PMN function and the role of PMNs in the age-related reduction in vaccine efficacy remain unclear.
One pathway that controls PMN antibacterial responses is the extracellular adenosine pathway but the role of
this pathway in vaccinated hosts and how it changes with age remain unexplored. This led to the hypothesis
that with age, there is a decline in intracellular bacterial killing following antibody mediated uptake of S.
pneumoniae, which is driven by changes in adenosine receptor signaling. This hypothesis will be tested using
two specific aims: 1) Identify why intracellular killing of S. pneumoniae is defective in PMNs from old mice and
2) Identify the role of adenosine receptor signaling in the age-driven decline in intracellular killing of S.
pneumoniae by PMNs. This project is significant as it will identify the mechanism of the age-related changes in
PMN function following antibody mediated uptake of S. pneumoniae. Additionally, PMNs are involved in host
defense against multiple pathogens, therefore this work may provide a potential therapeutic target to boost
overall vaccine protectiveness in aged hosts. The overall goal of this research training plan is to strengthen the
candidate’s knowledge in host-pathogen interactions, immunology, and immunosenescence. As well as to
advance technical skills in microscopy, signaling, and cell biology techniques. These aims and goals will be
accomplished with the guidance of the qualified mentoring team assembled by the candidate and will be aided
by the opportunities offered by the training environment at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine
and Biomedical Sciences. These resources will provide the necessary training and support to complete the
proposed research and guide the candidate’s future career in academia."
10747342,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this research proposal is to characterize the mechanosensory behaviors of skin-penetrating
parasitic nematodes that enable the location and invasion of a host organism. Skin-penetrating parasitic
nematodes, including the threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis, infect nearly one billion people worldwide and
are major sources of neglected tropical disease. S. stercoralis is normally found in the soil as infective third-
stage larvae (iL3s); soil-dwelling iL3s engage in a variety of behaviors that are thought to increase the likelihood
of host contact. The hypothesis that the sensation of mechanical stimuli by S. stercoralis iL3s and the ensuing
behavioral response are together integral to host seeking and skin penetration has long been postulated but has
not been tested. Furthermore, the underlying mechanotransduction pathways and mechanosensory neuronal
circuits are not known. The experiments in this proposal will address this gap in knowledge. The first set of
experiments will characterize the behavioral response of S. stercoralis iL3s to vibrations resembling those
generated by humans walking on soil. Specifically, the extent to which vibration attracts iL3s and promotes
behaviors that facilitate host attachment, including nictation, will be examined in detail. In parallel, an in-depth
analysis of the behavioral paradigm of skin penetration will be conducted using human skin. The proposed
experiments will also determine whether the stiffness or texture that is particular to human skin promotes skin
penetration. Behaviors induced by exposure to vibration and host skin will also be studied in other species of
parasitic nematodes – the skin-penetrating human-parasitic hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum and the
passively ingested murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus – and the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans to identify species-specific behavioral adaptations of skin-penetrating nematodes. Additionally, this work
will identify the mechanosensory genes and circuits that underlie host seeking and skin penetration by using a
combination of approaches: transcriptional reporters for genes that encode predicted mechanoreceptors to
identify putative mechanosensory neurons; targeted mutagenesis of the same genes with CRISPR/Cas9
followed by tracking of behavior; chemogenetic silencing of potential mechanosensory neurons using the
histamine-gated chloride channel HisCl1 followed by behavioral studies; and imaging of calcium transients in the
same neurons upon stimulation. Together, the work in this proposal will identify the mechanosensory behaviors
that are specific to skin-penetrating parasitic nematodes that enable host contact and host invasion. Existing
therapeutics for strongyloidiasis do not prevent re-infection; this work may alleviate the problem by uncovering
novel molecular targets for the development of preventive anthelmintic drugs and topical creams."
10889914,"ABSTRACT (PROJECT SUMMARY)
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in deposition of amyloid-b
(Ab) peptide in brain parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genes altering AD risk with the e4 allele of
apolipoprotein E (APOE4) showing the strongest association with AD and CAA. APOE4 modulates amyloid
accumulation in cerebrovasculature and impacts the efficiency of Ab clearance from the brain. In addition,
APOE4 carriers exhibit accelerated breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and higher risk for
cerebrovascular dysfunction during normal aging. However, the underlying mechanisms of this genetic
susceptibility on cerebrovascular function and pathology are still poorly understood. Recent work from our group
revealed APOE-driven protein perturbations associated with endothelial cells in the postmortem brain tissue from
AD individuals. Yet, these observations come from bulk brain tissue limiting the ability to dissect cell-type specific
proteomic changes. Thus, the major goal of this proposal is to molecularly define the endothelial cells in the
context of APOE-associated amyloidosis. I hypothesize that APOE4 genotype directly impacts endothelial
proteome leading to the BBB dysfunction and breakdown. In Aim 1, I will perform an unbiased proteomic analysis
of isolated cerebral blood vessels from cortical tissues of AD, AD with severe CAA, asymptomatic AD (AsymAD,
individuals exhibiting amyloid and tau accumulation in the brain with no cognitive decline), and non-demented
control individuals. I will further apply integrative analysis to the brain vascular proteomes and previously
generated proteomic data of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to identify AD CSF biomarkers that mirror pathological
changes of the cerebrovasculature. In Aim 2, I will explore in vivo effect of APOE and amyloid on endothelial cell
proteome by taking advantage of highly innovative, recently developed by our group approach that allows for
Cell-type specific In-vivo Biotinylation of Proteins followed by mass-spectrometry (CIBOP-MS). Dissecting
proteomes of endothelial cells in a disease setting will be a conceptual advancement and a crucial step towards
understanding the mechanisms underlying AD-related BBB breakdown, diminished blood flow, and pathological

Chronic pain is a major public health concern and among the most common reasons adults seek medical care in the
United States. Chronic pain is a complex biopsychosocial process modulated by psychological factors, including the
perception, appraisal, and emotional processing of sensations. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is increasingly common and
is associated with poor physical and mental health. Pharmacological approaches are relatively ineffective for long term
pain treatment and have high addictive and abuse potential. Given the myriad economic, psychological, and social costs
associated with CLBP, mind-body therapies (MBTs) such as yoga have received growing attention and empirical support
for its treatment. Still, less is known about how yoga improves pain outcomes for CLBP or how it compares to and
whether it operates distinctly from other physical activity interventions commonly used to treat CLBP. One hypothesized
mechanism of MBTs for improving chronic pain is through improvements in interoceptive awareness, or the awareness
of one’s internal bodily sensations. To date research has not examined the mechanistic role of interoceptive awareness
in MBTs for CLBP. Thus, building on an ongoing NCCIH-funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 12-week
yoga and physical activity interventions for CLBP, the proposed predoctoral study aims to 1) test whether a yoga
intervention results in greater changes in interoceptive awareness compared to physical activity; and 2) determine
whether changes in interoceptive awareness account for the clinical benefit of yoga for individuals with CLBP as
assessed by multiple measures of pain. This predoctoral study capitalizes on an ongoing clinical trial and adds a unique
and important contribution by assessing participants’ interoceptive awareness at baseline, mid-treatment (6-weeks),
and post-treatment (12-weeks). The proposed project will test the mechanistic role of interoceptive awareness on
improvements in both self-report (i.e., pain severity and interference) and objective (i.e., pain sensitization) assessments
of chronic pain. This research project will directly address three of NCCIH’s top research priorities by elucidating the
mechanistic role of interoception in mind and body treatments for pain. If the mechanistic role of interoceptive
awareness in yoga is supported, non-pharmacological mind-body pain therapies can be further optimized for enhanced
effectiveness in relieving CLBP. The fellowship’s training aims align closely with the goals for the proposed research
project. The individualized training plan will provide the applicant with specialized training in interoception, RCT
methodology, MBTs, biostatistics, and professional development for a research career in behavioral medicine. The
training plan will leverage existing resources available at the applicant’s primary institution, the University of
Connecticut, with collaboration and mentorship from leading experts across the nation."
10795643,"Spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D) are substantial health concerns impacting veterans at a higher rate
than the civilian population. The total economic burden of SCI/D is estimated at $9 billion/year to $400 billion in
lifetime medical and loss-of-productivity costs. The most common clinical presentation is high cervical SCI/D
which produces a broad spectrum of issues, including loss of hand function, autonomy, sensory changes,
spasticity, pain and autonomic dysfunction, profoundly impacting quality of life. Restoring these functions is the
goal of regenerative and rehabilitative therapeutic approaches for SCI/D. The VA Gordon Mansfield Spinal
Cord Injury Consortium (VA-GMSCIC) is a VA-funded effort to develop late-stage translational therapeutics in
a nonhuman primate (NHP) model in preparation for testing emergent therapeutic approaches clinically. Prior
and current funding has focused on multifaceted data collection on each subject with 5 different centers
collaboratively collecting data, each within their specific domain of expertise (physiology, behavior, histology,
neurorehabilitation, and molecular biology). This is an ideal use of the NHP model, as maximal information is
collected about the performance of therapeutic approaches in a small number of NHPs. Data from this
important model is characterized by the classic ‘3Vs of Big Data’: high volume (large images), high variety
(multi-modal data), and high velocity (robotic rehab; physiology; neuromodulation), providing both a challenge
and opportunity for novel discoveries. Application of modern data science tools can help deliver on the promise
of translational precision medicine for SCI/D. As our prior work demonstrates, effective management of VA
NHP big data enables us to effectively harness VA-GMSCIC data to drive new discoveries. However,
integrating these NHP big data requires ongoing data-driven integration of robotic rehab, kinematics, histology,
and medical information. Extraction of meaningful discoveries requires extensive computational work. The
purpose of the proposed renewal is to build on our ongoing success in assembling a data commons for the
VA-GMSCIC by integrating new types of high-resolution data in support of safety/efficacy studies of novel
therapeutics. Our data science team is well positioned to achieve this goal. Our team has provided analytical
support for the VA-GMSCIC, helping to integrate data from UCSD, UCLA, UCI, UC Davis and UCSF for testing
SCI rehab and regenerative therapies in NHPs for over 13 years. We have supported development of different
injury models, behavioral assessments, electrophysiology, kinematic measures, and therapeutic approaches in
100+ subjects. Under our current merit award (ending Nov 2020), our team built on this historical background
to establish a functional primate data commons (PDC-SCI) infrastructure that enables rapid, structured data
sharing, data integration, and analytics support across the VA-GMSCIC sites. The project has helped the VA-
GMSCIC evolve from focused discovery projects to late-stage translational studies with highly-sophisticated,
large-scale “big-data” collection. We aim to expand our knowledge-discovery pipeline for these critical
translational SCI/D big data to support planned safety/efficacy studies. Specifically, the renewal will build on
our successes and expand the scope of our work by supporting integration of: Aim 1) translational electronic
health records (tEHR), Aim 2) advanced robotic rehabilitation data, Aim 3) neuromodulation data from brain-
machine interfaces, and Aim 4) advanced machine learning analytical pipelines for rapidly integrating
multidimensional data. The goal is to help VA-GMSCIC efficiently test important therapeutic candidates for
translation to humans while promoting modern data stewardship adhering to the federally-endorsed FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data sharing principles. This will ensure that the existing
VA investment in data collection is leveraged to the maximal extent through digital technologies for enduring
knowledge-discovery from this valuable NHP model of SCI/D."

 Chronic pain is a serious and worsening epidemic in the United States and worldwide, seriously
degrading patient quality of life. Opioid drugs like morphine are the “gold standard” for treating moderate to
severe chronic pain, however, they are burdened by major side effects, especially addiction liability, which has
contributed to a paralell epidemic of opioid addiction, abuse, and overdose. In addition, opioids are ineffective in
some pain types, most notably neuropathic pain. In the search for alternatives, phytocannabinoids from Cannabis
sativa have been heavily studied. However, cannabinoids have generally been shown to have modest to poor
efficacy, and have their own side effects, especially psychoactive side effects with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
treatment. This has led again to a search for methods to improve cannabinoid therapy. For this reason, research
has focused on the ~150 terpene compounds found in Cannabis, which impart flavor and aroma to the plant.
Limited evidence suggests that terpenes produce pain relief on their own, and they have also been proposed to
modulate and potentially improve the effects of cannabinoids like THC, termed the “entourage effect” hypothesis.
However the quality of evidence on terpene efficacy is in general poor, limited by poorly-defined and complex
extracts, and few mechanistic studies. We thus performed a preliminary study on the Cannabis terpenes α-
humulene, β-pinene, geraniol, and linalool. We found that all 4 terpenes produced anti-nociception in a
mouse model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) comparable or better than
morphine. At the same time, geraniol and linalool produced no reward or aversion, suggesting no addictive
or aversive liability. Seeking mechanistic insight, we found that all 4 terpenes produced tail flick anti-
nociception by a cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) mechanism, and further synergized with the
cannabinoid WIN55,212, providing evidence for the entourage effect hypothesis. We further identified CB2,
Adenosine A2a, and anti-inflammatory activity as potential mechanisms of action. In this proposal, we will
extend these studies to evaluate therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of these terpenes in neuropathic
pain, providing potential support to the use of these ligands as improved non-opioid pain therapeutics. In Aim 1,
we will fully test the terpenes in a mouse model of CIPN, including dose/response, alternate neuropathy models,
side effects like tolerance and reward/aversion, synergy with other analgesics such as opioids and cannabinoids,
and terpene impact on side effects of these other analgesics (especially opioid reward). In Aim 2, we will identify
molecular mechanisms for terpene action in CIPN, focusing on 1) CB1/2, 2) A2a, and 3) anti-inflammatory
activity. We will use selective antagonists and CRISPR gene editing, identify sites of action (e.g. brain, spinal
cord, periphery), measure tissue response to terpene (e.g. cytokine production), and use in vitro models to
confirm these mechanisms. Together these studies will provide a rigorous evaluation of the potential use of
terpenes as efficacious and low side-effect therapeutics for neuropathic pain."

We propose to investigate the contribution of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Neat1 in astrocytes and identify
the epigenetic mechanisms in these glia cells involved in enhancing memory resiliency with age.
Interventions to enhance memory resilience within the aging population are possible. However, research studies
that inform resiliency in this area are still lacking. Within the aging hippocampus, it is now clear that abnormal
epigenetic control of gene transcription contributes to memory deficits. Nearly all the suggested epigenetic
mechanisms controlling memory formation have mostly been attributed to neuronal cells within the hippocampus,
largely disregarding these mechanisms in astrocytes. Thus, little is known about how astrocytic epigenetic
mechanisms influence memory resiliency with age. Our long-term goal is to study the role of lncRNAs in
astrocytes and to identify how these powerful epigenetic regulators impact memory formation with aging. Our
pilot data demonstrate that Neat1 expression is decreased in area CA1 of young adult mice and overexpressed
in aged mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibiting Neat1 expression in area CA1 of the hippocampus of
aged mice reverses memory impairments. Pilot studies also suggest a strong relationship between G9a
mediated H3K9me2 hypermethylation with Neat1 overexpression in aged adults. Based on these preliminary
results, we plan to rigorously investigate the effects of manipulating Neat1 in astrocytes and determine effects
on age-related memory decline. To gain further mechanistic insight into Neat1 mediated gene transcription in
astrocytes in the aging hippocampus, we will use state-of-the-art approaches such as CRISPR reprogramming
and chemogenetics to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms in astrocytes in our aging animal model system. Our
overarching hypothesis is that Neat1 contributes to age-associated changes in hippocampal astrocyte diversity,
astrocyte function and vulnerability to memory dysfunction. Our Specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1:
Test the hypothesis that Neat1 is associated with astrocyte diversity with aging; Specific Aim 2: To determine
the mechanism by which Neat1 acts to influence chromatin restructuring in astrocytes from young versus aged
animals; and Specific Aim 3: To determine the contribution of astrocytic Neat1 to memory resiliency with age.
Collectively, these studies will identify epigenetic mechanisms in astrocytes involved in age-related memory
decline, with broad implications for treatment options for age-related dementia and Alzheimer’s disease."

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide. Only two new classes of TB drugs
(diarylquinolines and nitroimidazoles) have been introduced into clinical practice since the introduction of the
current multidrug regimen in the 1970s. The lack of success in identifying novel drug targets suggests that the
reinvestigation of mechanisms of action and resistance of currently available drugs may be a more fruitful
approach. Rifampin, which targets the mycobacterial RNA polymerase, is one of the key sterilizing drugs
permitting the modern “short-course” 6-month regimen. The lengthy duration of TB treatment required to prevent
relapse reflects the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to persist in the host in an altered physiological
state characterized by reversible tolerance to first-line anti-tubercular drugs. Several mechanisms have been
reported to contribute to Mtb antibiotic tolerance, including the induction of drug efflux pumps and reduced
penetration of drugs into necrotic tuberculous lesions and across the waxy mycobacterial cell wall. Currently,
there is significant interest in maximizing exposures to rifampin in order to eliminate Mtb “persisters”, however
the mechanisms of tolerance to rifampin and other anti-tubercular drugs remain largely undefined. In order to
address this significant knowledge gap, we conducted a high-throughput transposon (Tn) mutant screen to
identify Mtb genes required for tolerance to rifampin in nutrient-rich broth and in physiologically relevant stress
conditions. Mutants containing a Tn insertion in the rv2224c/caeA gene were 294-fold more susceptible to
rifampin than was wild-type Mtb. This differential antibiotic susceptibility phenotype was confirmed using a
targeted caeA deletion mutant (ΔcaeA) and its complemented strain. We also found that caeA deficiency is
associated with increased rifampin accumulation and increased permeability to the polar molecule ethidium
bromide in Mtb. Previous studies have shown that CaeA, a cell wall-associated carboxylesterase and serine
protease, is critical for Mtb virulence. Disruption of caeA led to prolonged survival of infected mice and highly
reduced lung pathology. Further supporting the potential utility of targeting CaeA in TB treatment, deficiency of
this protein has been associated with increased Mtb susceptibility to the first-line drug ethambutol and the
second-line drug streptomycin. Using a combination of targeted and unbiased approaches, the current proposal
will test the hypothesis that CaeA mediates Mtb tolerance to rifampin by modifying Mtb cell wall composition,
thereby reducing drug permeability. In proof-of-concept studies using a recently generated inducible CaeA
degradation strain, we also will evaluate the treatment-shortening potential of targeting CaeA as adjunctive TB
therapy in a clinically relevant animal model. Our findings are expected to have far-reaching implications for
understanding antibiotic tolerance in Mtb and other persistent bacterial infections."

 Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous, complex, and aggressive breast cancer subtype.
TNBC patients respond poorly to chemotherapy, leading to high mortality rates and a worsening prognosis.
RNAi therapeutics, including siRNA and miRNA, have shown tremendous potential for TNBC cancer therapy.
Developing a safe targeted delivery system with endosomal avoidance of the payload is crucial in terms of
realizing the full potential of RNAi therapeutics and could revolutionize clinical treatment of TNBC.
 Our group has demonstrated that delivery of anti-miR21 to TNBC can efficiently inhibit TNBC cell proliferation
(Shu D, et al. ACS Nano. 2015, 27:9731; Yin H, et al. Shu D. Mol Therapy. 2019, 27:1252). We have also
recently reported the use of RNA nanoparticle orientation for decorating exosome surfaces with targeting ligands
to deliver siRNA loaded exosomes for TNBC treatment. We proved that exosomes can be utilized as
nanocarriers to deliver siRNA to TNBC cancer cells very efficiently to inhibit cancer growth (Pi F, Binzel D et al.
Nat. Nanotechnol. 2018;13:82). Preliminary data from the investigation with KB cell models in vitro has shown
the mechanism behind the high efficiency of cancer inhibition to be the cytosolic delivery of siRNA via exosomes
without endosomal trapping (Zhen Z, et al. J Control Release. 2019,311:43). In this study, we will investigate
the targeting and delivery mechanisms of RNAi to TNBC cells by exosomes displayed with TNBC specific
ligands for targeted delivery. It’s our goal to select a lead TNBC therapeutic candidate to move towards potential
clinical translation. We will combine the targeting and drug delivery capabilities of RNA nanotechnology and
exosomes for targeted delivery of RNAi to cell cytosols without endosomal entrapment.
 We will construct and evaluate the multi-functional exosomal RNA nanoparticle complexes harboring
targeting ligands including RNA aptamers (EGFRapt, or alternatively, CD133apt, CD44apt, and nAHRsapt) or
chemical ligand (Methotrexate) and tumor suppressing RNAi therapeutics (siRNA, suppressor miRNAs and anti-
oncogenic miRNA). We will further investigate the pathways of internalization and intracellular trafficking in
addition to investigating whether the payloads in the exosome are delivered to cytosol via fusion or to the
endosome via endocytosis. In depth studies of the release and cellular processing of RNAi cargo loaded into
exosomes will be completed. We will investigate the PK/PD parameters, delivery mechanisms, antitumor
efficacy, and safety of the therapeutic RNA nanoparticles in order to select a lead candidate for preclinical
translation. The preclinical studies will give a clear understanding of the viability of exosome-RNA nanoparticle
complexes for TNBC therapy and provide data to move towards an Investigational New Drug (IND) application
that will facilitate advancement to clinical trials."

Young adulthood is a challenging time focused on making important decisions that can either facilitate or hinder
independence across a variety of domains. The CHOICE-STRATA Study (CHOICE STudy of Racial diversity in
AOD use during the Transition to Adulthood) has assessed alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and functioning in
numerous domains (e.g., social, economic, health) across 13 waves of data in youth from age 10 to age 24
(R01AA016577, R01AA020883, R01AA025848), with retention rates averaging 84% across the 12 waves
completed to date, and 91% from age 18 (waves 8-12). The proposed study, STRATA-XP (eXPanded), provides
an important opportunity to follow this large and racially/ethnically diverse cohort into young adulthood (ages
25-28), a unique developmental period for which there are few contemporary longitudinal studies of AOD use.
This application responds to NOT-AA-20-017: Epidemiology and Prevention in Alcohol Research, focused on
understanding the developmental trajectories of alcohol use, risky drinking, and alcohol use disorders and the
correlates of ""maturing out"" of heavy drinking. We propose to conduct 4 additional annual surveys from age 25-
28 (N=2,500) and address the following aims: Aim 1a: Identify trajectories of alcohol use (as well as tobacco,
cannabis, and other drug use) from age 10 into young adulthood. 1b.Examine effects of individual factors (e.g.,
resistance self-efficacy), peer factors (e.g., time spent around peers who use) and neighborhood factors (both
subjective and objective, including alcohol and cannabis outlet density) on AOD use trajectories. Aim 2:
Examine how AOD use trajectories across adolescence and emerging adulthood predict outcomes through age
28 in three core domains: 1) risk behaviors (e.g., AOD use and disorder, risky sexual behavior, delinquency), 2)
health-related quality of life (e.g., mental, physical, social), and 3) adult role functioning and transitions (e.g.,
employment, relationships and family formation, life satisfaction). Aim 3:Examine how adult role functioning
and transitions, such as pursuing a career and parenting, longitudinally predict subsequent changes in AOD use
and other risk behaviors, as well as health-related quality of life, in young adulthood. Aim 4: Provide an
understanding of potential across race/ethnicity, gender, and educational attainment that may occur across the
AOD trajectories and the factors associated with these trajectories. Continuing this work will move the field
forward by providing a better understanding of developmental patterns, antecedents, and consequences of AOD
use among today's young people as they transition into young adulthood."

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is exacerbated by impaired liver regeneration. The cellular basis of liver
regeneration is unclear and whether hepatocytes in different zones differ in regenerative activity is unclear, in
part because fate-mapping has only been performed on a few hepatocyte subsets. The liver is organized into
zones in which hepatocytes express different metabolic enzymes. To systematically compare the regenerative
activities of these distinct subsets of hepatocytes, we developed twelve new CreER strains. Lineage tracing
during normal homeostasis showed that cells from periportal zone 1 and pericentral zone 3 contracted in number,
while cells from mid-lobular zone 2 expanded in number. Hepatocytes in different regions of the liver thus exhibit
differences in turnover and zone 2 is an important source of new hepatocytes during homeostasis. Because
zone 2 may represent a reserve population sheltered from pericentral and periportal liver injuries, we hypothesize
that these cells also preferentially repopulate livers exposed to modest chronic injuries such as alcohol. Our
preliminary scRNA-seq and in vivo CRISPR screens identified two critical zone 2 specific genes that regulate
zone 2 hepatocyte proliferation and survival: Igfbp2 and Hamp2. Both of these secreted factors are suppressed
in NAFLD and ALD in humans, which suggests functional importance in disease. Igfbp2 operates through mTOR
and Ccnd1 to promote zone 2 hepatocyte proliferation. Hamp1 and Hamp2 encode for hepcidins, which
negatively regulate iron uptake by inhibition of iron transporters and thus protects the body from iron overload.
Patients with ALD accumulate hepatic iron through suppression of hepcidins. Free iron enhances reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production in the liver, leading to alcohol-induced liver injury. We hypothesize that ALD
pathogenesis is accelerated through the suppression of Igfbp2 and Hamp1/2, and that this involves changes in
the number or function of zone 2 hepatocytes. In Aim 1, we will first use our CreER models to systematically
determine the extent to which zone 2 cells repopulate the liver in the setting of ETOH. To understand how zone
2 cell might be involved in regeneration after ETOH, we will perturb two critical zone 2 genes using loss and gain
of function approaches. In Aim 2, we will ask if Igfbp2 is necessary and sufficient to regulate the frequency or
repopulating activities of zone 2 cells in the context of ETOH. In Aim 3, we will ask if Hamp1 and Hamp2 are
necessary and sufficient to regulate the frequency or repopulating activities of zone 2 cells. Success in this
project will for the first time define the cellular basis of regeneration in response to ETOH, allow us to focus on
critical subpopulations, and determine the importance of two critical zone 2 specific genes in ALD."

Determinants of COVID19-induced venous thrombosis and targeted therapy assessed with
bioengineered Vein-Chip
Challenge: Increasing evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2, which is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-
19, is able to trigger the formation of blood clots within the veins of patients. This ultimately manifests into strokes
and other life-threatening complications, being observed even in younger people. Related to that, is emerging
data that shows that the endothelial cells are dysfunctional across several organs other than the lungs of the
most severe COVID19 patients. These cells express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, to
which the virus attaches, using it as an entry point to infect cells. A recently created vein-on-a-chip (vein-chip)
that is an endothelialized organ-on-a-chip model incorporating the unique hemodynamics of the venous valve
cusp showed evidence that this model can be used to dissect the role of major determinants of venous
thrombosis – endothelium; hemodynamics; and blood components – together known as the Virchow's
triad. The central hypothesis in this proposal is that the venous thrombosis observed in COVID19 disease is due
to the interaction of the three determinants of thrombosis (Virchow's triad) – endotheliitis; complex
hemodynamics; and blood coagulability. There is an unmet need to understand the effects of the virus and/or
blood-borne inflammatory cytokines on the endothelium; and the interaction of these effects with the uniquely
complex venous hemodynamics (mechanotransduction); and to discover strategies to stabilize the endothelium
that may be co-operatively therapeutic with anticoagulants.
Proposal: The objective here is to deploy vein-chip technology to understand the determinants of SARS-CoV-
2 induced venous thrombosis; determine the roles of endothelial, hemodynamic and humoral alterations; and
propose therapeutic strategies. This objective will be met through three specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize the
SARS-CoV-2 induced endothelial dysfunction in the human Vein-Chip; Aim 2: Assess interplay of SARS-CoV-2
infection and hemodynamics in DVT with Vein-Chip, and Aim 3: Therapeutics-on-Chip: Assess
combinatorial therapeutics in infection-led DVT with Vein-Chip. The team driving this proposal is composed of
complementary expertise in vein-chip bioengineering and innovation (Jain); applying contemporary technology
in the molecular and computational biology of endothelial function and fate (Cooke); together with techniques to
define host response to coronaviral infection (Connor).
Impact: Taken together, the outcomes of this proposal will directly improve our understanding of thrombosis in
COVID-19 infection and make predictions that could potentially result in fast-tracking of therapeutic clinical trials."

10842305,"Abstract
3’ Untranslated Regions (3’UTR) are mRNA ends located between the STOP codon and the polyA tail. They
contain numerous regulatory elements that are poorly characterized, making them a core target for post-
transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. MiRNAs are small
regulatory RNAs that bind 3’UTRs and repress mRNA translation. Our group and others have shown that
alternative polyadenylation (APA), an elusive process observed in metazoans that gives rise to genes with
various 3’UTR isoforms, is widespread. While APA is frequently present in normal states and in virtually all
diseases, its biological role in cells and tissues is a mystery. Genes with longer 3’UTRs have more potential
regulatory sites, thus APA may allow genes to alter their 3’UTR length and escape the repression by miRNAs
and RNA binding proteins. Since APA is abundant this could explain why there is not a direct correlation
between cellular transcriptomes and proteomes. Understanding the global mechanics of 3’end formation, APA
function, and miRNA targeting would advance research on post-transcriptional modifications. Metazoans
possess hundreds of miRNAs and thousands of 3’UTR isoforms, most of which are expressed and function in
different tissues and developmental contexts. We know little about how these networks operate and
communicate with each other, despite their critical role in controlling gene expression. We need to gain new
data and insights, and develop a high-resolution miRNAs/3’UTRs Interactome by acquiring and fusing tissue-
specific miRNA localization data, miRNA target data, and 3’UTRs isoform data. Our Interactome will provide
the global basis of post-transcriptional gene regulation function in vivo, elucidating its role in both normal and
disease states in metazoans. In our first R01 grant we studied tissue-specific APA events and miRNA networks
in the nematode C. elegans, to define and probe the worm miRNAs/3’UTRs Interactome. We identified 3’UTR
isoforms in eight C. elegans somatic tissues, acquired miRNA expression data for the three largest and
disease-relevant C. elegans worm tissues, developed and implemented unbiased methods to map miRNA
targets in high throughput, and initiated mechanistic studies of APA selection in genes identified in our studies.
For this new submission we will, (1) complete the worm 3’UTRome by including new tissue-specific 3’UTR
isoforms, (2) identify tissue-specific miRNA populations in eight worm somatic tissues and, (3) perform
mechanistic studies to determine tissue-specific PAS choice in the context of APA. Our curated 3’UTRome will
be the first database to provide a complete metazoan 3’UTRome mapped at a single base resolution.
Investigating three global hypotheses of PAS choice can uncover global post-transcriptional gene regulatory
mechanisms implicated in tissue development and disease, and therefore of high impact. We believe that the
impact of these new studies is high since will provide important results toward a global understanding the
biology of post-transcriptional gene regulation in metazoans.

10864009,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Lung cancer is highly lethal and accounts for nearly as many deaths as
breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers combined, but most lung cancer cases are potentially
preventable. About 80-90% of cases are smoking-related, and screening followed by high-quality treatment has
been shown to reduce the risk of death in people at high-risk. Therefore, smoking cessation interventions plus
screening are two complementary pillars that are recommended together by the US Preventive Services Task
Force and other guidelines to reduce the lung cancer death rate. Unfortunately, uptake of lung cancer screening
(LCS) remains low and although disparities in lung cancer deaths by socioeconomic factors, including rurality,
are widely acknowledged, they remain understudied. Evidence shows that rural areas have higher lung cancer
death rates than urban populations, likely related to risk factors and healthcare access. However, efforts to
understand and address rural-urban disparities are hampered by low representation of rural populations in public
data systems. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate factors that contribute to lung cancer disparities between
rural and urban areas and provide contextual information for future interventions and policies. Our specific aims
are to: (1) Characterize the delivery of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for lung cancer prevention and early
detection, comparing rural to urban areas, by assessing differences in use of smoking cessation interventions
and LCS at multiple levels of influences; (2) Identify potentially modifiable care gaps across the LCS continuum,
including risk assessment and timely treatment, by examining patients who died of lung cancer relative to patients
who are alive by rural-urban status; and (3) Evaluate similarities and differences in the barriers and promoters
to delivery of EBIs across the LCS continuum (smoking cessation, shared decision-making, screening, and
treatment) in the rural and urban contexts. We will use a multidimensional health equity framework to apply a
convergent, mixed methods approach for our studies. We will leverage the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a
unique population-based data resource for a 27-county contiguous area in the Midwestern US, along with the
Southern Community Cohort Study across 12 states in the Southeastern US, among a diverse population of 50-
80-year-old people. We will use Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes to define rurality and will assess both self-
reported and area-level socioeconomic information. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with patients and
clinical staff to gain perspectives on LCS barriers and promoters, including the potential role of smoking-related
stigma. The proposed research has the potential for high impact by elucidating gaps on lung cancer prevention
and early detection that will translate directly into strategies to address intransigent lung cancer disparities in our
study population, and beyond. We will thus address priorities of the NCI and the President’s Cancer Panel to
advance equity and address the potential COVID-19 impact on the delivery of LCS. Our transdisciplinary team
has a track record of high-impact research and has the needed expertise to successfully complete this research."

10794998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K24 application seeks to provide protected time for the applicant, Yvonne Lee, MD, MMSc, to mentor
trainees in patient-oriented research (POR) and grow her research program. Dr. Lee is the Solovy/Arthritis
Research Society Professor in the Division of Rheumatology at Northwestern University (NU) Feinberg School
of Medicine. She is also the Associate Director of the Rheumatology T32 and Associate Director of the
Methodology Core of the NU Core Center for Clinical Research (P30). Her research focuses on understanding
pain mechanisms in patients with arthritis. This area presents a large unmet need, as few investigators have
expertise in both rheumatology and the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying pain. If new investigators are not
trained, millions of patients will continue to suffer, despite costly immunosuppressive drugs and/or surgeries.
Dr. Lee is well-suited to act as a research mentor because she has an established history of mentoring and
leading innovative interdisciplinary POR projects. She is the PI of an R01-funded, multi-site project to study
pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and she has served as primary or secondary research mentor
for over 20 pre- and post-doctoral research trainees. Support from the K24 would provide Dr. Lee with
protected time to: 1) mentor early investigators across various fields (e.g., rheumatology, kinesiology, sleep
and circadian medicine, neuroscience, anesthesiology, behavioral sciences) in POR; 2) improve POR
mentoring skills through training and guidance from senior mentors; 3) expand into new scientific areas (sleep
and autonomic medicine, neuroimaging) through interdisciplinary collaborations; and 4) replenish support for
her research program through new NIH funding. Her research has established that abnormalities in central
nervous system (CNS) pain pathways are important contributors to the pathogenesis of chronic pain in arthritis.
Preliminary data also suggest that sleep disturbances and autonomic dysfunction play key roles in this
process. The current proposal builds upon this work and leverages the infrastructure of her funded R01, which
is recruiting patients with early RA to identify changes in pain pathways during the first 12 months after RA
onset. This K24 will add assessments of sleep-wake patterns and parasympathetic tone to the ongoing study,
with the objective of identifying associations between these measures, neuroimaging assessments of
underlying CNS regulatory pathways, and patient-reported pain. In addition to these new research avenues,
mentees will benefit from working on: 1) existing data from the original Central Pain in Rheumatoid Arthritis
(CPIRA) cohort; 2) ongoing data collection from the expansion of CPIRA to patients with early RA in CPIRA-2;
and 3) data from other datasets to which Dr. Lee has access through existing collaborations. Conduct of the
proposed research program will advance the field by identifying modifiable pathways involved in the
development and maintenance of chronic pain in patients with arthritis. Ultimately, this work will suggest
potential therapeutic approaches that Dr. Lee and her research team will test in future interventional studies."
10738305,"Project Summary
 Speech production is timed precisely during conversations. People demonstrate a remarkable ability to adjust
the start and stop time of their speech depending on what others say. The long-term goal of the proposed work
is to understand the neural mechanism that gives rise to the precise control of speech timing during
conversations. Specifically, this proposal focuses on the control for quickly stopping an ongoing production
before an utterance is finished. Neural circuits involved in speech production are found across many cortical
areas, such as the sensorimotor cortex, the premotor and prefrontal cortices. Existing evidence has shown how
these circuits support the generation of speech sound. For example, the ventral part of the sensorimotor cortex
(vSMC) contains a representation of articulators (e.g., lip, jaw, tongue). Neural activity in vSMC encodes the
articulatory kinematic trajectories during speaking. However, little is known about the neural circuit controlling a
sudden stop of speech. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the principles underlying normal speech
production, as well as the causes of speech and communication disorders like stuttering and aphasia.
 The proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that the premotor areas contain a neural network that
distinguishes sensory inputs indicating a stop and generates signals to modulate vSMC for stopping. The
premotor areas provide input to the vSMC and serve important functions in speech preparation and sensorimotor
transformation. Dr. Zhao will incorporate high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) to record neural activities
directly from the human cortex while participants perform speech production tasks. High-density ECoG is a state-
of-the-art technique with fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are well suited for studying the neural
dynamics of speech. Aim 1 will define the premotor signal for the control of speech stopping. Participants are
instructed to make intermittent stops during speech production following visual cues. Aim 2 will determine the
effect of stop activity on articulatory control during stopping. Dr. Zhao will obtain knowledge of articulatory
phonetics and psycholinguistics, and the experimental techniques to measure articulatory kinematic features
during speech stopping. Aim 3 will determine the role of the premotor network for stopping in conversation
contexts. The outcome of this project is expected to provide basic knowledge for understanding the normal
function of speech production, which is necessary for improving treatments for speech and communication
disorders in the future. Dr. Zhao will be supported by a top-tier academic environment and world-class experts
at University of California, San Francisco, and University of California, Berkeley. This grant will provide training
opportunities of human cortical neurophysiology and skills in linguistics, which will facilitate his smooth transition
to an independent investigator."
10758857,"Project Summary: This project investigates the relationship between gentrification, displacement, and
contextual determinants of health (CDOH) using consumer trace data as a unique new source to examine long
term mobility for a large number of individuals. The impacts of neighborhoods on health are well established;
differences in residential environments contribute to inequalities in health outcomes that systematically
disadvantage racial/ethnic minorities. Gentrification is the process through which lower income neighborhoods
experience a rapid rise in their relative socioeconomic position within the metropolitan region (Core-Based
Statistical Area or CBSA). It is an increasingly prevalent phenomenon in recent decades with the potential to
cause negative health outcomes through residential displacement. Yet, we currently have limited evidence on
whether residents of gentrifying neighborhoods are more likely to move compared to residents of non-gentrifying
neighborhoods; where they move to, particularly if the destination neighborhoods are more disadvantaged in
terms of contextual CDOH, defined as place-based CDOH that operate at the neighborhood level; and who is
more likely to move, specifically if racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately impacted.
Data limitations have constrained empirical investigation of the public health impacts of gentrification. The
proposed research leverages consumer trace data from Data Axle that have broad population coverage and
high temporal and spatial specificity to further our understanding of gentrification, mobility, and health disparities.
Our multidisciplinary team's expertise in demography, applied economics, sociology, and public health is ideally
suited to conduct this research.
Specific aims: (1) document the impact of gentrification on mobility patterns; (2) demonstrate how these mobility
patterns affect exposure to key CDOH shown to contribute to the perpetuation of socioeconomic and race/ethnic
inequities in health; and (3) examine the differential effects of gentrification across race/ethnicity, gender,
residents socioeconomic status, local housing market dynamics, as well as metropolitan-area segregation levels.
To achieve these aims, our approach leverages a novel longitudinal dataset for the 100 largest US metros based
on consumer trace data at the address level with broad population coverage, including for lower income
residents. We will use regression at the individual level controlling for individual and neighborhood characteristics
to establish the relationship between gentrification (defined at the tract level) and likelihood to move, distance
and characteristics of the moves as well as to analyze changes in CDOH (at different scales depending on
conceptual considerations and data availability) among stayers and movers between 2006 and 2020.
The proposed research is the first to our knowledge to address these questions with such comprehensive data
and represents a significant contribution to public health. It will also develop open-source infrastructure to
produce neighborhood level migration measures that can support future research."

Chronic pain affects >25 million Americans per year, with enormous impacts on both quality of life and
productivity. Despite advances in our understanding of nociception in animal models, new and effective
treatments for patients with chronic pain have been lacking. The poor translation between mouse and human
pain targets has highlighted limitations of animal models of pain. Recent advances in single-cell genomics and
physiology directly in human tissue position pain researchers to make important new advances with improved
opportunities for clinical translation. The Harvard PRECISION Human Pain Center proposes to leverage state-
of-the-art single-cell technologies to characterize human nociceptor subtypes and how their gene expression
patterns vary across diverse populations (Project 1) as well as in chronic pain conditions that clearly localize to
these cells – chronic phantom limb pain associated with painful neuromas (Project 2). The Projects will generate
a wealth of data for the scientific community by closely integrating with 5 Cores tasked with 1) procuring high-
quality human pain-related tissues following strict regulatory practices, 2) offering the latest single-cell gene
multi-omic technologies, 3) performing advanced single-cell spatial transcriptomic analysis, 4) managing,
integrating, and distributing all of the data, and 5) administrating and connecting to Center the other PRECISION

10909001,"PE becomes the third leading cause of cardiovascular-related death, and more than 500,000 cases of PE
occur in the United States (US) every year, resulting in approximately 200,000 deaths and hospitalization of
over 250,000 patients. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of PE are of paramount importance to ensure the highest
quality of care. Every year 1-2% of the 120 million emergency department (ED) patients in the US undergo
computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for PE. The referring physicians rely heavily on CTPA
reports diagnosing or excluding PEs. Clarity of the radiology report is one of the most critical qualities, and the
American College of Radiology has emphasized a need for precision communication in radiological reports.
Yet communicating uncertainty effectively in radiology reports is challenging. Referring physicians may
interpret radiologists’ textual expressions that convey diagnostic confidence differently than intended. The gap
between radiologists’ intended message and the referring physicians’ interpretation can not be completely
resolved through structured reporting or standardized lexicon. Unnecessary hedging language in CTPA reports
may further worsen the reporting ambiguity and may lead to inappropriate treatment of patients. Therefore, we
aim to develop a deep learning-based approach for context-aware (un)certainty assessment (DeepCertainty),
which is end-to-end trainable, calibratable, generalizable, scalable, and explainable. It would allow for fine-
grained uncertainty measurement and standardization, facilitate consistent and accurate diagnostic certainty
communication in CTPA reports and thus improve PE care. This study will build the foundation for future
implementation and integration of DeepCertainty into clinical workflows to prompt real-time low-certainty alerts
for improving PE diagnostic reporting quality and clarity, which will inform better treatment decisions for ED
patients with suspected PE."
10834200,"Project Summary / Abstract
The goal of research in the Leibfarth group is to develop platform synthetic methods that enhance the
thermomechanical, adhesion, and degradation properties of polymers while also uncovering mechanistic insights
that broadly inform synthetic method development. This goal informs our two complementary research areas
that seek to 1) leverage chemo- and regioselective C–H functionalization to enhance the properties of commodity
polymers and 2) develop stereoselective polymerization methods that uncover emergent polymer properties from
simple chemical building blocks. We have identified a compelling opportunity to make progress on a grand
challenge in biomedicine – the discovery of degradable biomaterials with concomitant control of
thermomechanical properties, degradation profile, and metabolic fate – by leveraging our expertise at the
interface of asymmetric catalysis, C–H functionalization, and polymer chemistry. In the five-year period of this
MIRA grant, we propose to develop new catalytic approaches to control the stereochemistry of degradable
polymers and establish a domain-selective approach to tune the material properties of polymers post-production.
These methods will provide access to heretofore unknown semicrystalline biomaterials where critical parameters
such as the chemical composition, polymer molar mass, and percent crystallinity can be systematically varied.
The novel polymer structures accessed as a result of this work and the comprehensive evaluation of their
degradation mechanism will enable the identification of design rules for the development of new classes surface
eroding biomaterials. More specifically, we aim to develop new catalytic methods for the stereoselective
polymerization of cyclic monomers through complementary kinetic resolution and enantioconvergent synthetic
approaches. We envision that the discovery of previously unprecedented stereodefined polymers can be
accomplished by developing a comprehensive understanding of structure–reactivity relationships that determine
stereoselective addition of monomers to a reactive polymer chain-end. Further elaboration of this stereoselective
polymerization philosophy will enable the pursuit of methods for stereoselective radical polymerization in a
controlled manner through chiral Lewis acid catalysis, thus providing a strategy to create highly functional and
stereodefined polymers from widely-available vinyl monomers. Complementary to the pursuit of stereoselective
polymerization, we have identified late-stage functionalization as an underutilized approach to diversify the
properties of existing polymers relevant to biomedicine without resorting to de novo synthesis. This philosophy
can be used on current materials in medical devices as well as further expand the utility of the new, stereodefined
polymers we discover in the course of our research program. By developing methods to conduct domain-
selective C–H functionalization reactions, we propose to systematically tune the water transport into the
amorphous phase of semicrystalline polymers and, therefore, influence their degradation mechanism."
10829906,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive pulmonary disease characterized by frequent
episodes of acute deterioration termed acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). The underlying biological
mechanisms and risk profiles contributing to AECOPD are poorly understood. The nasal mucosal environment,
including the inflammatory state and nasal microbiome, play a role in host defenses against viral infections.
Susceptibility to viral infections, a trigger of AECOPD, is a potential mechanism for the COPD frequent
exacerbator phenotype. Our research group has established approaches to rigorously characterize and quantify
the nasal mucosal immune environment and microbiome, as well as determine the functional status of the nasal
immune environment with a controlled Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) exposure. Our overall objective
is to determine the immune alterations and functional implications of changes in the nasal immune environment
and microbiome present in individuals with frequent AECOPD. We hypothesize that dysfunctional nasal immunity
underlies the frequent AECOPD phenotype and therefore presents a novel mechanism of increased AECOPD
risk. We hypothesize that these immune alterations will impact responses to controlled viral infection and could
predict the course of naturally occurring AECOPD. We will define the nasal immune environment (Aim 1) and
microbiome (Aim 2) of frequent exacerbators, infrequent exacerbators, and healthy non-smokers, using cluster
analyses to define the nasal “biological fingerprint” of the frequent AECOPD phenotype. Through longitudinal
assessments embedded in these Aims we will define the variations of these measures during stable state and
during AECOPD. We will then use a Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) model to determine the functional
implications of differences in the respiratory immune environment of frequent and infrequent exacerbators during
a controlled viral challenge (Aim 3). Successful completion of these aims will lead to the first rigorous
characterization of the nasal mucosal and microbiome changes associated with frequent exacerbators of COPD,
validate these findings in a controlled experimental setting, and advance a novel hypothesis that the frequent
exacerbator phenotype arises from altered nasal immune responses and microbiome constitution."
10999296,"A cancer diagnosis requires patients and their intimate partners to communicate effectively to navigate illness-
related challenges. Research indicates that couples who use effective communication strategies have better
individual psychological adjustment and higher relationship satisfaction. However, many couples have difficulty
communicating about cancer-related issues which can lead to poorer individual, relationship, and patient health
outcomes. While dyadic interventions to improve couple communication have proven efficacious, they are
often time intensive and have limited reach. The challenges of recruiting couples into dyadic interventions are
well-documented, with low recruitment rates especially among underserved couples. Micro-interventions,
which consist of brief educational materials and short activities delivered via text message or a mobile
application, have significant potential to increase reach and participation in diverse groups of couples by
increasing flexibility and reducing barriers to access. Previous studies have found micro-interventions to be
effective in promoting health behavior change in a wide range of individuals and in enhancing dyadic
functioning in community couples. To date, there are no existing micro-interventions that have been developed
and tested in couples coping with cancer. Therefore, the proposed project aims to develop, and pilot test a
text-messaging micro-intervention focused on improving communication skills for couples coping with
advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. The content of the dyadic micro-intervention will be adapted from
existing, empirically validated couple-based interventions developed for cancer and non-cancer couples. Aim 1
focuses on developing the micro-intervention through focus groups and interviews with couples coping with
advanced GI cancer and community advisors representative of minority groups, along with user experience
testing with the target population. The data collected will be used to increase content relevance, acceptability,
feasibility, and cultural sensitivity of the micro-intervention. Aim 2 will be a randomized pilot test of the dyadic
micro-intervention to assess feasibility and acceptability. Aim 3 will examine pre-to-post intervention outcomes
as measured by improvements in relationship satisfaction and constructive communication. This project is in
line with the National Cancer Institute’s priority research area of cancer survivorship and has the potential to
increase health equity in cancer by increasing participation of underserved couples. The proposed project will
provide training in 5 key areas for the applicant: (1) psycho-oncology and cancer control, (2) theories and
didactics related to the development, implementation, and dissemination of behavioral interventions in the
context of cancer, (3) mixed research methods specific to development of psychosocial interventions, (4)
health equity, diversity, and inclusion training, and (5) professional development. The unique and extensive
resources available at Duke University Medical Center, including the Duke Cancer Institute, will aid and
enhance training, scientific productivity, and successful completion of the proposed project."
10817910,"Mucin, a major protein component in mucus, plays a critical role in mucosal innate defense by providing a
physical barrier and trapping pathogens for mucociliary clearance. If uncontrolled, excessive mucin production
overwhelms mucociliary clearance and causes conductive hearing loss in otitis media (OM) and mucus
obstruction in lung infections. Therefore, mucin production must be tightly regulated. However, the molecular
mechanisms underlying the tight regulation of mucin remain largely unknown.
 Otitis media (OM) is the most common childhood bacterial infection and the leading cause of conductive
hearing loss. It remains a major health problem and a substantial socioeconomic burden. S. pneumoniae, Sp,
represents a major gram-positive bacterial pathogen for OM. Currently available Sp vaccines have a limited
impact on OM. Moreover, inappropriate antibiotic use increased antibiotic-resistance. There is an urgent need
for developing innovative non-antibiotic therapeutic agent for suppressing mucus overproduction. Our long-term
goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying OM pathogenesis and identify novel therapeutic
targets. In contrast to the relatively well-known toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent mechanisms by which Sp and
pneumolysin (PLY – a key virulence factor produced by virtually all clinical Sp isolates) induce host mucosal
immune response, the TLR-independent mechanisms including the key regulators remain largely unclear.
Adenosine 5’-monophosphate-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1) has emerged as a master regulator of host
energy homeostasis. Its role in infectious diseases, in particular in the host mucosal innate defense response,
e.g. mucus production, remains largely unclear. Our encouraging preliminary data suggest that Sp and PLY may
up-regulate mucin MUC5AC and MUC5B via activation of AMPKα1 in a TLR2/4-independent manner in the
middle ear and airway epithelial cells in vitro and in the mouse models of both acute and chronic OM.
Interestingly, Sp and PLY may activate AMPKα1 by inducing novel non-traditional (protein degradation-
independent) ubiquitination of AMPKα1 likely via downregulating a key deubiquitinase CYLD. Together, these
exciting preliminary data have thus provided a solid foundation for us to hypothesize that [1] AMPKα1 acts as a
key regulator for Sp-induced up-regulation of MUC5AC and MUC5B via TLR-independent signaling; [2]
Activation of AMPKα1 by interplay between polyubiquitination and phosphorylation plays a critical role in Sp-
induced up-regulation of MUC5AC and MUC5B (hypothesis). To test our hypothesis, we will pursue two specific
aims to determine (Aim 1) the role of AMPKα1 in OM pathogenesis in both AOM and COM; and (Aim 2) how
Sp activates AMPKα1. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of the key regulators including
AMPK in TLR-independent host mucosal innate defense in bacterial infections and lead to the identification of
novel therapeutic targets for controlling mucus overproduction. Our AMPK signaling studies may also help
understand molecular mechanisms of other AMPK-related diseases (Significance and Impact)."

A detailed insight into the molecular defects leading to neuronal death in ALS/FTD is still missing, hindering the
development of a cure. Defects in the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT)
have been proposed to play a central role in ALS/FTD pathology. An outstanding knowledge gap is what are
the mechanisms, consequences, and pathogenic relevance of impaired NCT on neuronal resilience in
neurodegenerative diseases and during aging. The objective of this application is to identify at the mechanistic
level the novel cellular and molecular pathways that are dysfunctional and cause the failure of the NCT
ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a
main modulator of nuclear stability and NPC function, and that changes to this pathway in ALS/FTD lead to a
diminished ability of neurons to cope with stress and physiological stimulation.
The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Define how actin regulates the function and dysfunction of the
NPC. We will perform a systematic and in-depth investigation of the molecular interactions between actin and
the NPC using pharmacological and genetic approaches in iPSC-derived neurons carrying the C9ORF72
mutation. 2) Identify the consequences of NCT defects on the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome in
response to cellular stimulation. By combining an “omics” approach with a candidate approach (i.e. CREB
pathway), we will analyze changes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome in iPSC-derived neuronal models
of ALS/FTD following stimulations, and we will test the potentials of cytoskeleton modulation to rescue such
defects. 3) Define how defects in nuclear import affect the transcriptional response to cellular
stimulation. We will analyze changes in gene expression and splicing profile in ALS/FTD neurons following
cell stimulation by RNA-Seq. Network analysis performed by integrating the results from the transcriptomic and
proteomics approaches will identify ALS/FTD relevant altered pathways. Modulation of the cytoskeleton will be
used to rescue the identified defects.
At the completion of this research, we will have identified the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control
the stability and function of the NPC, and the functional consequences that the disruption of NCT has on the
resilience of neurons in ALS/FTD. Gaining insights on what pathways upstream and downstream of the NPC
are affected in ALS/FTD will greatly expand our understanding of disease pathogenesis and will allow us to
identify yet unexplored avenues for therapy in these diseases. Ultimately, we expect that our research will lead
to more effective therapeutic strategies that take advantage of the crosstalk between NPC, RNA regulation,
and cytoskeleton. This research will have a broad impact on a spectrum of diseases including but not limited to
ALS/FTD."
11041484,"Co-use of both tobacco and cannabis products is common among young adults (ages 18-24), and recent
data suggest that rates of co-use may be rising in line with changes in regulatory and retail landscapes for these
drugs (e.g., recreational cannabis legalization; the spread of “vape shops” nationwide). This is a serious public
health problem, as individuals who engage in co-use –especially those who use tobacco and cannabis on the
same use occasion (e.g., mixed together in the same delivery device)– may use both drugs more heavily and
show poorer functional outcomes in domains such as mental health and physical ailments. Although the vast
majority of studies on co-use to date have focused on combustible products, the rising popularity of electronic
nicotine delivery systems and similar devices to “vape” nicotine and cannabis (hereafter, vaping products) has
led to novel methods for co-using these drugs. This is concerning because although less risky to health than
combustible products, vaping is not harm-free. Yet, little is known about daily patterns, correlates, and
consequences of nicotine and cannabis vaping co-use in young people. The current study will address these
substantial gaps in the knowledge base by 1) using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to assess daily
patterns of nicotine and cannabis vaping and product co-use and 2) leveraging 13 years of annual survey data
spanning early adolescence through emerging adulthood to examine predictors and consequences associated
with young adults’ patterns of nicotine/cannabis vaping in daily life. We plan to recruit 240 participants from
the ongoing, multi-wave STRATA cohort study of ~ 2,500 young people based primarily in California, for
which annual data on substance use and other risk factors has been collected since 2008. We will use EMA
administered via a smartphone application over a three-week period to assess daily patterns of
nicotine/cannabis vaping, examine within- and across-day situational factors and functioning associated with
nicotine/cannabis vaping. We will also link EMA data with longitudinal STRATA survey data to examine
prospective associations between risk factors in adolescence and real-world (EMA) patterns of
nicotine/cannabis vaping in young adulthood. Finally, we will compare findings for individuals who engage in
co-use of both nicotine and cannabis vaping products (NV+CV; n=80) against those who vape nicotine only
(NV; n=80) or cannabis only (CV; n=80) to explore how patterns, predictors, and consequences of co-use
may differ from single-product use. Findings from this study will significantly improve the understanding of
factors associated with nicotine and cannabis vaping in young adults and can inform regulatory efforts and the
development of prevention/ intervention programs to mitigate potential harms associated with use of these
novel drug delivery systems."

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are key sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that secrete diverse hormones
important in many processes dysregulated in metabolic disease in humans, such as satiety signaling and glucose
homeostasis. EECs are divided into subtypes based on their predominant hormone. As enteroendocrine
hormones have different and sometimes antagonistic metabolic effects, this subdivision enables finely-tuned
control of metabolism in response to a variety of dietary stimuli. Many reports have shown that this careful
balance is disturbed in humans and mice with obesity and metabolic disease, including changes in the number
of EECs, EEC subtype distribution, and circulating EEC hormone levels. Despite these advances, we still do not
understand the processes that regulate EEC adaptation to diet and how these processes may differ across EEC
subtypes. To address these gaps in knowledge, my mentors’ labs recently established zebrafish as a model
system for studying EEC physiology. The optical transparency of larval zebrafish enables live imaging to observe
EEC adaptations in vivo and in real time, a level of resolution not available in live mammals. Using the zebrafish,
we discovered a novel phenomenon of acute change in EEC morphology and reduction in EEC nutrient
sensitivity after high fat feeding we named “EEC silencing.” The objective of this proposal is to understand the
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this high fat feeding-induced EEC adaptation. Specifically, I will
test the contributions of lipid signaling from enterocytes and hormone signaling from an inhibitory EEC subtype
in mediating high fat feeding-induced EEC silencing. This work is expected to significantly advance our
understanding of the fundamental physiology of intestinal adaptation to diet with important implications for human
metabolic disease."
10814156,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major epidemic in the United States, and women appear be more vulnerable
than men to certain aspects of the disease. Specifically, women develop OUD more rapidly (i.e. the
telescoping effect), experience higher levels of cue-induced drug craving, and suffer more serious drug-related
health consequences as compared to men. Despite the severity of this problem in women, preclinical studies
have historically focused on males only, resulting in a male-centric basis of OUD; therefore, the purpose of
this application is to determine sex differences in the development, expression, and molecular
mechanisms of OUD. Our extended access (24-hr/day) self-administration procedure readily induces an
addiction-like phenotype in rats, including an enhanced motivation for the drug, compulsive use, and
vulnerability to relapse, when examined following protracted withdrawal. We have also validated this animal
model by showing that treatment during withdrawal with buprenorphine, an FDA-approved medication for OUD,
greatly attenuated vulnerability to relapse in both males and females. Notably, in this animal model, we have
established biological sex as an important vulnerability factor with females showing an enhanced vulnerability
to relapse compared to males, which mirrors the sex differences observed in humans. We also have strong
preliminary data indicating that, as with findings for stimulants, estradiol drives the enhanced vulnerability to
OUD in females. Thus, an additional goal of this application is to evaluate the impact of ovarian
hormones on the expression and molecular mechanisms of an opioid addiction-like phenotype in
females. Sex and hormone-dependent differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying an addiction-like
phenotype will be characterized using RNA sequencing. This will allow us to characterize the transcriptome
profiles associated with addiction-like phenotype in females for the first time and to determine how these
changes differ from those observed in males and in females as a function of hormonal status. We will focus on
changes in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) given its critical role in OUD. Our overall hypothesis is
that an addiction-like phenotype will develop sooner in females than males and that in females, estradiol will be
critical for the expression of addiction-like phenotype and the corresponding transcriptional changes. To
address this hypothesis, we will first determine whether the telescoping effect reported in women with an OUD
is biologically based (Aim 1) and address the impact of ovarian hormones on the expression of this phenotype
in females (Aim 2). We will then use RNA-seq to identify sex- and hormone-specific molecular changes
associated with the development of an enhanced vulnerability to relapse (Aim 3). The findings from these
studies will provide critical information on sex differences in the development and expression of key features of
OUD and foundational molecular data on the underlying mechanisms of OUD in females, which can be used to
guide the development of new sex-specific prevention and treatment strategies for OUD."

Tissue repair is a complex process that involves a delicate temporal balance between inflammatory and
regenerative mechanisms. In health, initial inflammatory events are replaced by regenerative processes in a
coordinated manner. This sequence is disrupted in diseased states and complex injuries. The goal of
regenerative medicine is to reestablish this balance by preventing chronic/aberrant inflammation and promoting
repair and regeneration in a tissue-specific manner. While stem cell and growth factor therapies have been
explored for this purpose traditionally, recent studies highlight the immunomodulatory and protective functions
of mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs). Although MSC EVs possess versatile
properties, to engage tissue-specific pathways and fit the goals of precision medicine with translational
relevance, MSC EVs have to be engineered for enhanced pathway-specific functionality and delivered on site
in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. In this proposal, leveraging our preliminary results and our
expertise in EV biology, immunology and bone biology, we hypothesize that: Spatiotemporal control of
immunomodulatory and regenerative pathways can be achieved by selective incorporation of Functionally
Engineered EVs (FEEs)in 3D printed scaffolds. Using bone regeneration as a model system, we will test this
hypothesis in three specific aims. In aim 1, we will generate functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) that target
specific osteoinductive and immunomodulatory pathways. In aim 2, we will develop a photocrosslinkable
alginate-based delivery system with EV carrier and release motifs for spatial localization and temporally
controlled delivery of the FEEs developed in aim 1. In aim 3, we will utilize 3D printing technology to print
defined structures encapsulating the FEEs for spatially and temporally controlled biphasic delivery in vivo. This
system will be tested in a rat calvarial defect model. From the proposed studies, we will develop a platform
technology that can impact the field of regenerative medicine beyond the craniofacial and musculoskeletal
systems."

The impact of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains poorly understood, especially in the context
of protein-protein interactions within vulnerable regions that drive dysfunction. Despite growing appreciation of
the clinical course, presentation, and severity of AD, studies of sex impacting AD development and progression
are lacking. Although recent high-throughput and bioinformatics technologies help to understand molecular and
genetic basis of sex differences in aging and AD, reliance on static `omics data representing a descriptive
inventory of biomolecules measuring changes in their stoichiometry at a given time and condition limits functional
insights. Another roadblock is translating these complex datasets into biological insights requires sophisticated
computational algorithms, diminishing access and impact to the biomedical community at large.
To address these limitations this proposal introduces epichaperomics, an unbiased state-of-the-art `omics
approach we invented to generate direct access to interactome perturbations and to the functional outcome of
such changes in native biological systems. We posit by applying epichaperomics to well-characterized
postmortem human brains that i) capture the disease trajectory, ii) encompass AD vulnerable and less affected
regions, and iii) have robust parallel information on patient-specific correlates, will enable rigorous hypothesis-
generating analyses on potential impact of stressors and vulnerabilities on disease trajectory, and on interactome
as well as connectome dysfunctions as they occur in sex-dependent manner. Through this novel approach we
expect to derive mechanistic innovation on specific dysfunctions impacted by sex differences leading to insights
into sex-phenotype relationships not available through other `omics platforms. By evaluating, understanding, and
anticipating interactome changes through epichaperome formation in relation to sex impact (Aim 1) and
subsequent straightforward computational analysis with web-based output (Aim 2), first-of-a-kind proteome-wide
insights into the impact of sex differences on interactome networks vulnerabilities and dysfunctions within the
hippocampus and regions of the default mode network in relation to the relatively spared cerebellum, both on
their nature and trajectory, in vulnerable cells and brain regions will be generated. Information how stressors and
vulnerabilities (e.g., genes, environment, hormonal status) interact at cell and brain connectome levels to
produce heterogeneous phenotype mapping of disease vulnerability will be produced. We posit a whole new
treatment paradigm avenue will open, providing a previously unavailable sex-specific precision medicine
approach to AD by understanding and targeting the interactome across the AD spectrum of no cognitive
impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia through stressor and vulnerability analysis. Raw
datasets and data analytics from interactome network studies will be deposited into free-access portals
accessible by the scientific community for additional mining and hypothesis testing studies. A web-based user-
interface will also be designed facilitating data processing and visualization."
10829345,"Project Summary/Abstract
Episodic memory is the memory that allows us to mentally re-experience specific episodes from our personal
past. During memory encoding, the continuous stream of experience is segmented into individual episodes,
where each episode encodes a sequence of events ordered in time. Yet, how neural circuits perform
computations to segment experience and encode sequentially occurring events remains unknown. Revealing
the circuit-level mechanisms behind these computations is essential for understanding episodic memory in both
health and disease. In the hippocampus, a brain area essential for episodic memory, neurons are sequentially
activated as an animal travels through an environment. The sequential firing of these so-called place cells
repeats each time the animal revisits the same path, as if the animal’s previous experience of traversing the path
is recollected. However, rich sensory cues are present in every environment, making it difficult to assess how
much of the spiking activity in the place cell sequence is independent of direct sensory inputs. Reversibly toggle
sensory inputs on and off during locomotion has made it possible to isolate the sequential activity produced by
the internal computation (internally generated sequences (IGSs)) from that driven by sensory inputs. These IGSs
that occurred during locomotion coincide with the performance of memory tasks, suggesting that they are
memory-related sequential activity patterns. Interestingly, IGSs reoccur in each trial of a memory task and
sometimes appear following spontaneous locomotion onset, implying that hippocampus can identify behavior-
level boundaries and encode specific segments of experience. Revealing the neural circuits that underlie the
expression of IGSs within a segment of experience such as a single behavior trial will provide new insight into
how continuous experience is segmented and selectively encoded. The objective of this study is to elucidate
the circuit-level mechanisms that evoke IGSs, and test the hypothesis that distinct types of interneurons in
hippocampal CA1 coordinately modulate the state of the pyramidal neuron population thus gating IGS expression.
Accomplished in three aims, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach encompassing the use of in vivo
functional recordings, cell-type specific chemogenetic and optogenetic perturbations, and behavioral analysis to
identify the behavioral conditions required for IGSs to occur, and determine how two distinct types of interneurons
coordinate to signal the start of integration and control the window of integration, thus gating the occurrence of
IGS. Completion of these aims will contribute to novel insights into how neural circuits operate to segment
experience and encode episodic memory, and what can go wrong under pathological conditions such as
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease where impaired episodic memory profoundly impacts the patients’ quality of life."

The substantial time and effort required to harmonize data for global multi-cohort collaborations can lead to
research delays, particularly given heterogeneity in data, data management capacity, and data sharing
regulations. The goal of the Harmonist project is to develop data standards, software, and methods that help
HIV observational research consortia to coordinate multiregional research projects and apply data
management best practices more effectively and efficiently. To promote reusability, Harmonist tools are built
(when feasible) as shareable External Modules for the widely used Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) software, which is in use at over 4,450 institutions in 138 countries as of mid-2020. The initial
Harmonist suite of tools includes the Harmonist Hub, a platform for scientific project and portfolio management,
and the Data Toolkit, a web-based system for data quality checking and secure data exchange.
The Harmonist project aims to (1) strengthen data harmonization and consortium support for the International
epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium, including providing a new data framework for
IeDEA prospective studies, (2) expand support to the Regional Prospective Observational Research for
Tuberculosis (RePORT) International consortium, which studies TB in the context of HIV, and (3) support bi-
directional mentorship and sharing around Harmonist tools, data management best practices, and data
standards.
This proposal is a collaboration among research informatics experts at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, all
seven regional networks of IeDEA, and RePORT International. These partnerships ensure that all components
of Harmonist address real-world user needs in a practical manner and provide the tools with a dedicated user
base. We believe that these research tools can reduce the time and effort needed for critical data management
and administrative tasks that underlie the role of observational HIV cohorts studying the global epidemic. The
modular infrastructure we have designed can adapt to diverse research settings and expand to include new
data types and sources as the understanding of HIV evolves. The resulting shareable software and mentoring
resources will provide tangible immediate and long-term benefits to IeDEA, RePORT, and the broader HIV
research community."
10809774,"SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the
objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’.
However, recent studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells impact
the brain during aging, and could this knowledge be used to restore functionality of old brain and treat
neurodegenerative diseases?
 The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain provides a great paradigm to address this question, as this
regenerative region of the brain contains many different cell types – neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial cells,
microglia – and exhibits clear functional decline during aging. To gain a single cell understanding of the changes
that occur with age in neurogenic niches, we recently performed single cell RNA-sequencing of young and old
neurogenic niches in mice. This analysis revealed a striking infiltration of cytotoxic T cells only in the old
neurogenic niche, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from old
SVZs are clonally expanded and secrete interferon g (IFNg), suggesting that they have encountered specific
antigens. We also showed that T cells can impair NSC proliferation both in co-cultures and in vivo. Based on
these data, our specific hypothesis is that T cell clonal expansion in old brains drives the deterioration of the
neurogenic niche with age, and that preventing this T cell expansion restores function to old neurogenic regions.
Probing this idea would be critical to counter the decline in brain function during aging and neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following experiments:
1. To determine how T cells infiltrate neurogenic niches in old individuals;
2. To understand the functional impact of T cells on old neurogenic niches;
3. To examine the interaction between immune cells and neurogenic niches in young, old, and rejuvenated
individuals.
 Completion of these aims will provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of T cell and other
immune cells during aging in regenerative niches of the brain. This work should also give a fundamental
understanding of the mechanistic impact of the interferon response and T cell cytotoxicity on different cell types
in the brain. Knowledge from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including
new immunotherapies, for the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain
function during aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease."
10833102,"Abstract
 The primary cilium is a solitary microtubule-based organelle that protrudes from the cell surface and is
found on most vertebrate cells. It serves as a sensory organelle in organs such as the kidney and retina and
also functions in transducing extracellular signals such as Hedgehog (Hh), a secreted signaling molecule that
is essential for embryo development and cell proliferation and differentiation. Defects in cilia structure and
function are associated with a diverse array of developmental abnormalities, collectively termed “ciliopathies”.
 Hh signaling in vertebrates occurs in primary cilia and is primarily mediated by Gli2 and Gli3 zinc finger-
containing transcription factors. Gli2 is primarily an activator, whereas Gli3 is mostly a repressor, though it also
exhibits a weak activator function. Consistent with their functions, most full-length Gli3 (Gli3FL) is proteolytically
processed to generate a C-terminally truncated repressor in the absence of Hh signaling, while only a small
fraction of Gli2FL is processed. Gli2/Gli3 processing is induced by phosphorylation of the first four of the six
serine/threonine residues at their C-termini by protein kinase A (PKA) and then by glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) and casein kinase 1 (CK1). The multi-phosphorylated Gli2/Gli3 are then ubiquitinated and partially
degraded by the proteasome. Hh signaling inhibits Gli2/Gli3 processing by suppressing PKA-mediated
phosphorylation of the first four PKA sites and also activates Gli2FL/Gli3FL by inhibiting the phosphorylation of
the fifth and sixth PKA sites in their C-termini.
 Defects in cilia structure and function mostly affect Hh signaling. One near universal hallmark of ciliary
gene mutants at the molecular level is the reduced Gli2/Gli3 processing. Interestingly, however, the levels of
Gli2/Gli3 activity in ciliary gene mutants vary from none to elevated depending on mutated ciliary genes. This
suggests that the mechanism by which ciliary proteins regulate Hh signaling is diverse and complex. While the
effect of ciliary mutations on Hh signaling is well established, the molecular mechanisms underlying these
effects are thus far unknown. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
Gli2/Gli3 processing, stability, and activity are altered in ciliary gene mutants."

Rates of sexually transmitted infections are on the rise in the United States, including those caused by
Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is also increasing and has been recognized as a
serious emerging public health threat by WHO and the US CDC. A vaccine against N. gonorrhoeae could help
combat the spread of antibiotic resistant N. gonorrhoeae, however, an effective vaccine for N. gonorrhoeae has
thus far eluded discovery. Individuals infected with N. gonorrhoeae do not develop immunity to subsequent
infection, limiting our understanding of the immune responses required for protection from infection. Mass
vaccination campaigns in New Zealand and other countries with vaccines against N. meningitidis serogroup B
made from outer membrane vesicles have been followed by reduced reported rates of N. gonorrhoeae
infections in those countries. The US FDA-approved N. meningitidis serogroup B vaccine (4C-MenB) contains
both N. meningitidis outer membrane vesicles and two recombinant antigens that are highly related to N.
gonorrhoeae homologs of the antigens. Our research team currently uses a unique human experimental
infection model to study N. gonorrhoeae in its natural host. Because the use of the 4C-MenB vaccine is not yet
widespread within the US, there is a unique and time-sensitive opportunity to test the effectiveness of this
vaccine in preventing N. gonorrhoeae using our human challenge model. The proposed clinical trial will also
allow us to study immune responses to the 4C-MenB vaccine and determine which responses are essential to
the protective effect of the vaccine. The current proposal requests support for the implementation of the
proposed clinical trial, which represents an important step in the development of an effective N. gonorrhoeae
vaccines."

 The intergenerational persistence of poor health and poverty and the quest to understand underlying
processes underscore the importance of rich multigenerational data. Very few existing datasets contain
comprehensive information on social, environmental, and biological factors over the life course and across
generations; lack of such data has limited attempts to identify the processes shaping health disparities,
economic inequalities, and causal linkages between the two. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study
(FF) is the longest running birth cohort study in the U.S. that is based on a national probability sample. It
follows parents (G1, for Generation 1)—both mothers and fathers—and their children (G2) who were born in
1998–2000. The G2 children are now having children of their own. We propose to expand the FF study by
conducting a perinatal survey on the health of the third generation (G3) children, early parenthood experiences
of G2, and the characteristics of households and families into which G3 are born, as well as collecting saliva
samples from the G3 children and their non-FF parents and stool samples from the G3 children; we refer to
this project as the FFG3 study. The augmented data will have many unique and valuable features, including:
(1) three generations of sociodemographic, environmental, and biological data; (2) extensive data on parenting
in two generations (G1 and G2); (3) data on siblings and half-siblings (in G3); (4) genetic data on trios (G3
children and both of their parents); and (5) comprehensive data on perinatal health (pre-pregnancy, prenatal,
delivery, neonatal, and postpartum factors) and circumstances in two generations (G2 & G3). The FFG3 study
will facilitate novel and important analyses of intergenerational transmission of health, intergenerational
relationships within families, and gene*environment effects on health. It will also provide an essential
foundation for future G3 data collection at subsequent developmental transitions including school readiness at
the transition to school, and health and development in middle childhood, adolescence, and the transition to
adulthood."
10830948,"Up to 100 million Americans live with ongoing pain, costing $635 billion annually. In the United States, there
are more than 200,000 people living with SLE, a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease with multi-organ
involvement that disproportionately affects females and racial minorities. Living with a chronic disease such as
SLE confers multiple challenges. Pain is a frequent self-reported symptom in SLE and is often one of the first
symptoms of the disease. Despite treatment advances, pain remains the most prominent, unaddressed patient
complaint. The management of pain in SLE has recently become more challenging because of the alarming
epidemic of addiction and mortality attributed to opioid misuse. An estimated 31-46% of patients with SLE use
prescription opioids. In one study, 70% of individuals using opioids used them for ≥1 year, and 22% were
taking ≥2 opioid medications at the same time. Patients with SLE are nearly twice as likely as the general
population to have opioid-related overdose hospitalizations. However, efforts to mitigate opioid misuse cannot
be achieved without a detailed understanding and sustained investment in clinical research on the underlying
mechanisms that produce and maintain chronic pain. Characterizing the burden of chronic pain in SLE is
challenging on at least two counts. First, we lack data on the prevalence and burden of chronic pain in SLE,
partly due to the absence of reliable approaches to identify patients with clinically significant pain in electronic
health records (EHR). Second, there is a critical need to understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms and
correlates that drive the pain experience in SLE. In this mentored career development award (K01), Dr. Titilola
Falasinnu will use computational methods to increase the understanding of the clinical management chronic
pain in SLE using EHR. In Aim 1, Dr. Falasinnu will develop a computational chronic pain phenotyping
algorithm using diagnostic codes, pain scores, narrative clinic notes and medications extracted from the EHRs
of two large healthcare systems (n~2,400). She will then use the algorithm to estimate chronic pain prevalence
in a population-based registry (n~76,000). In Aim 2, Dr. Falasinnu will comprehensively phenotype
biopsychosocial correlates of chronic pain using an existing registry of ~500 patients with SLE attending a
multi-disciplinary pain center. Throughout the award, Dr. Falasinnu will build on her doctoral training as an
epidemiologist and biostatistician to develop new skills in biomedical informatics to conduct impactful pain
medicine research. These skills will include working with EHR and registry data, machine learning and natural
language processing, pain science, grant-writing, and scientific communication. Through coursework, clinical
observation in pain medicine clinics, mentorship, and external conferences and workshops, Dr. Falasinnu will
gain the skills needed to apply for her first R01 and pursue a career as a tenure-track principal investigator."

This knowledge gap is an important problem because it not only reduces our ability to treat arousal disorders,
such as hypersomnia and fatigue, but also impacts treatment and deeper understanding of many
neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurological disorders that often include severe arousal disruption,
including depression and Alzheimer's disease. Our long-term goal is to understand the anatomic, cellular and
synaptic outflow bases by which the SCN regulates brain arousal. The objectives of this application are to 1)
determine if Neuromedin S-producing SCN (SCNNMS) neurons promote arousal, 2) define their state-dependent
firing profile in vivo; 3) establish a functional tri-synaptic circuit spanning SCNNMS->dorsomedial hypothalamus
(DMH)->ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), 4) define the functional synaptic physiology of the DMH->VLPO
interface, including the cellular profile of the targeted neurons, 5) determine presynaptic inputs to SCNNMS
neurons, and 6) define the molecular/transcriptional landscape of SCNNMS neurons. The central hypothesis is
that SCNNMS neuron are both necessary and sufficient for clock regulation of arousal levels. The rationale for
the proposed research is that identifying the anatomic, cellular and synaptic bases by which the SCN can
modulate arousal levels is a critical first step towards manipulating them and reducing the dysfunction
experienced by individuals with disorders of arousal. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing four specific aims: 1) Determine in vivo if acute activation/inhibition of SCNNMS neurons can
promote/attenuate arousal, respectively, and, via in vivo Ca+2 imaging, if they exhibit a wake-active profile; 2)
Demonstrate that SCNNMS neurons are functionally, synaptically connected with sleep-promoting VLPO
neurons via a DMH `relay'; 3) Determine the sources of presynaptic inputs to SCNNMS neurons and confirm
functional connectivity; and 4) Determine molecular heterogeneity within the SCNNMS cell population. The
approach is intellectually and technically innovative because it seeks to reveal the mechanistic basis by which
the SCN regulates brain arousal and because it employs a novel combination of newly developed and
validated approaches. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to vertically advance and
expand understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms subserving the SCN clock. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential to inform the development of treatments to reduce the dysfunction and negative
health effects experienced by not only the growing number of patients with circadian- and arousal-based
disorders, such as hypersomnia and fatigue, but also of those suffering one of the host of neuropsychiatric,
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders with severe arousal disruption, such as depression or
Alzheimer's disease, including many in which a clock contribution has been implicated or demonstrated."

10834827,"Project Summary
Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is a common inherited heart disease that can cause major limitations to
daily acts of living, poor prognosis, and mortality. There are as many as 1.5 M people with HCM in the US alone, 2/3 of
whom have the obstructive form of the disease with over 50k remaining refractory to medical management and are
candidates for septal reduction therapy (SRT). Despite this, only ~1,200 patients per year of the 50k currently indicated
receive SRT, leaving the vast majority of the most severe patients untreated. The reason for is the highly invasive nature of
existing SRTs that cause frequency cardiac rhythm abnormalities requiring implantation of a pacemaker or cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) and have unacceptably high rates of peri- and post- procedural mortality (up to 10%). Additionally, many
patients are unsuitable for existing SRT procedures due to existing co-morbidities and/or anatomical limitations.
This Phase II SBIR proposes development of a novel treatment for oHCM by precisely targeting the source of the obstruction
on the interventricular septum (IVS) using a novel high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) catheter. Our approach
takes a relatively safe, femoral venous approach to the right ventricle (RV) using existing delivery tools and knowhow
within cardiac electrophysiology. Treatment focuses on delivery of HITU to selectively ablate the entire mid-myocardium
of the IVS while sparing the cardiac conduction system on the sub-endocardium (His-Purkinje), thereby reducing risk of
heart block requiring pacemaker or ICD insertion.
This proposal builds upon the Phase I-equivalent work in acoustic physics, and pre-clinical proof of concept with a prototype
catheter demonstrating that, by generating deep lesions in the mid-septum with a HITU, the IVS thickness can be reduced
by approximately 30%. Based on catheter irrigation features and HITU’s natural focusing characteristics sparing the sub-
endocardium, heart block can be avoided even in the setting of extensive ablation in this region.
The aims of this proposal will focus on maturation of catheter design elements and manufacturing methods to make the
prototype device suitable for clinical evaluation, verify the functionality and safety of the system to relevant international
safety standards (particularly IEC 60601-2-62 standards), and validate the safety, efficacy, and durability of this therapy in
acute and chronic (3-month) preclinical models via clinically accepted modalities (cardiac MRI, TTE, clinical pathology,
gross pathology and histopathology).
The information obtained in this grant will be used in direct support of early feasibility IDE submission with the FDA as
part of a future phase of the grant. Commercialization of our system will bring lifesaving therapy to thousands of critically
ill patients every year and eventually expand to treatment of HCM patients in earlier stages of the disease before long-
standing obstructive hypertrophy resulted in irreversible health consequences."
10764305,"Several subregions of the human amygdala receive direct projections from the olfactory bulb, yet the functional
and anatomical properties of these olfactory projections are not well understood. Rodent studies have begun to
shed light on the functions of some of these olfactory amygdala subregions in mediating olfactory-guided social
and approach/avoid behaviors. However, there are significant differences in the projections from the olfactory
bulb to the amygdala between species. For example, in rodents, the medial amygdala receives highly dense
fibers from the accessory olfactory bulb. In stark contrast, humans lack an accessory olfactory system entirely.
There are also other apparent differences in the specific amygdalar targets of main olfactory bulb projections
between species, although these targets have not been well-characterized in humans, further highlighting the
need for human studies in this area. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the anatomical and
functional properties of the olfactory projections into the human amygdala. We will take a multifaceted
approach, combining functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology and stimulation, which will strengthen the
reproducibility and rigor of our findings. The goal of Aim 1 is to anatomically and functionally localize the
primary olfactory cortical regions of the human amygdala. At the structural level, we will use a novel new multi-
shot diffusion-weighted imaging sequence to localize olfactory projections into amygdala subregions. At the
functional level, we will use resting fMRI combined with k-means clustering algorithms to parcellate amygdalar
subregions based on distinct whole-brain functional connectivity profiles, and event-related fMRI to functionally
localize odor-responsive subregions of the amygdala. The goal of Aim 2 is to shed light on the roles of distinct
amygdala subregions in olfactory perception. We will use event-related fMRI to acquire high-resolution
multivariate signals from the amygdala during olfactory perceptual tasks. The goal of Aim 3 is to assess the
necessity of the amygdala subregions in olfactory perception. We will use intracranial EEG techniques to
measure different olfactory perceptual decisions during clinician-delivered, clinically prescribed, disruptive
electrical stimulation directly into the human amygdala. The proposed studies will provide a detailed
characterization of the functional and anatomical properties of an under-studied group of amygdala subregions,
including the medial nucleus of the amygdala, the cortical amygdala and the periamygdaloid cortex. Recent
studies suggest these anterior and medial amygdala areas may play a role in sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP), which is the leading cause of death in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and has no
known cause or treatment. Furthering our understanding of the functional and structural properties of these
brain regions has strong clinical importance for these patients."
10862797,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hematologic disease. Studies have shown that
comprehensive medical care can decrease adverse outcomes associated with SCD, but such care is not
easily accessed. It is estimated that less than 70% of children with SCD receive comprehensive care, and only
20% experience effective care coordination. Additionally, comprehensive sickle cell centers are most
commonly located in major metropolitan areas, making it difficult for families in rural or medically underserved
areas to access comprehensive care. Telemedicine, the remote provision of medical care using modern
information technology, is a potential strategy to address the barriers experienced by patients with SCD
living in rural and medically underserved areas. Not only have studies demonstrated that telemedicine is
safe and effective, but the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic has shown how it can increase local access to
subspecialty care. My preliminary work in preparation for this resubmission demonstrated the feasibility
and acceptability of telemedicine for SCD care in a rural part of Indiana (AHRQ K12 HS026390). My long-
term goal is to improve access and adherence to quality care for children with SCD. The objective of this
application is to investigate the use of various telemedicine models to provide comprehensive care to
children with SCD in rural and medically underserved communities without ready access to specialized
services. We will use the results gathered from our preliminary K12 work to adapt, refine, and pilot an
existing hub-and-spoke model and a direct-to-consumer model. I hypothesize that both telemedicine
models will be a feasible means of providing evidence-based comprehensive pediatric SCD care to
patients in rural or medically underserved areas, with caregivers and patients having decreased barriers
to care and improved caregiver/patient-centered outcomes with the direct-to-consumer model. The specific
research aims of this proposal are: (1) Adapt two telemedicine models for use with children with SCD using
caregiver input from our preliminary K12 work; (2) Demonstrate the feasibility of the telemedicine models
developed in Aim 1 as they undergo successive stakeholder refinement during use in actual clinical care; (3)
Evaluate the effectiveness of the refined models from Aim 2 in a pre/post study by assessing (a) process of
care measures, (b) provider satisfaction, (c) caregiver/patient-centered outcomes, and (d) clinical outcomes
and healthcare utilization. I will apply for R21/R03 funding to scale-up the models to additional
communities statewide based on how each performs in different environments. I will also apply for R01
funding to assess, through a randomized controlled trial, their effect on health care utilization, disease
outcomes, and caregiver/patient-centered outcomes. This work can be adapted to evaluate the impact of
telemedicine on issues like hydroxyurea use and adherence. The proposed research will also help me
develop skills in patient-centered research methods as well as improvement and implementation science."

New drugs with different modes of action than SCYX-7158, the current clinical candidate, are needed for
chemotherapy of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) caused by T. brucei spp. Starting with the FDA-
approved drug lapatinib (EC50 = 1600 nM; selectivity index (SI) = 4 (compared to human HepG2 cells), we
have synthesized over 540 analogs in a medicinal chemistry campaign focused on optimizing SI, toxicity
profile, metabolism, physicochemical properties, aqueous solubility (Aq. Sol.) and CNS penetrance. Our new
lead NEU4438 is orally bioavailable and extends the life of trypanosome-infected mice 2.4 (P = 0.008; Kaplan-
Meir analysis), accompanied by a 109-fold reduction in parasitemia. A quinolinimine, NEU-4438 has excellent
potency (GI50: 0.013 μM), selectivity (SI: >2000), physicochemical properties (aq. sol.: 880 μM; LogD7.4: 0.9;
cLogP: 2.52) and in vitro ADME (human PPB%: 15; HLM Clint: 21.8 µl/min/mg protein; RH Clint: 13.1 µ//min/106
cells). Six NEU4438-related advanced hits are available for evaluation as possible leads, should NEU4438 fail
to cure HAT in murine models of the disease. We will further our work by optimizing the quinolinimine scaffold
using singleton and parallel medicinal chemistry approaches after constructing a virtual library, shaped by
drug-like expectations in silico. Compounds will be synthesized and screened through a funnel established to
select those with the best selectivity index, solubility, and physicochemical properties. Advanced hits will be
evaluated in mice for safe safety, tissue exposure, and brain penetrance, after which those with the best
features will be tested for efficacy in mice models of HAT to select lead drugs (exemplified by NEU4438), that
may be progressed into preclinical candidates. Towards identification of the targets of the drug lead, NEU4438-
binding proteins will be identified using photoaffinity probes. Concurrently, molecular modes of action will be
studied by NEU4438 perturbation of the trypanosome proteome, followed by tests of hypotheses formulated
from the proteomics data. In order to identify physiological targets, the phenotypes observed after knockdown
of genes encoding NEU4438-binding proteins will be expected to “phenocopy” the effect of adding NEU4438 to
T. brucei. Our achievements put us on track to deliver two new preclinical candidates, and to identify their
physiological targets as well as modes of action in the next funding period."
10763395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Physician-scientists play a unique role in bridging the gap between basic science and clinicians through the identification
of important clinical questions and translating results to improve patient care. Regrettably, the physician-scientist workforce
has continued to diminish, which may lead to negative, long-lasting consequences in biomedical research. Many residency
programs focus heavily on acquiring medical knowledge as opposed to fostering intellectual curiosity and an introduction
into the biomedical research field. Furthering the diminishing interest in a career as a physician-scientist is the ability to
identify an encouraging and successful mentor. There is a critical need for a renewed emphasis on established physician-
scientists as role models to trainees. In this proposal, we aim to enhance attractiveness and preparedness for a career as a
physician-scientist during residency training. Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), frailty, and
multimorbidity in aging are fundamental areas of science that greatly benefit from a robust physician-scientist workforce.
The overall goal of this training program in ADRD, frailty, and multimorbidity in aging is to raise interest and preparedness
of future physician-scientists to tackle the problems facing the aging population by providing a solid foundation to train
residents to be productive, independent scientists who can advance studies in a broad range of areas from basic science to
clinical investigation. To this end, we propose the implementation of the Massachusetts General Hospital Diseases of
Aging Pathway via Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (MGH DAP StARR) program. The program will train
new physician-scientists throughout the biomedical research continuum who will promote new preventative and therapeutic
measures for aging-related diseases. The MGH DAP StARR program is centered around the following four objectives: [1]
engage in the creation of important scientific contributions through strong, longitudinal mentorship with an emphasis on
leadership essentials; [2] develop laboratory, translational, or clinical research approaches necessary to conduct high-
quality research in pertinent areas of aging; [3] formulate hypothesis-based research questions, development and execution
of a research project, and effectively communicate the significance of their science with intense mentorship from NIA-
funded investigators; and [4] establish a pathway for continued development as independent physician-scientists in ADRD,
frailty, and multimorbidity in aging. MGH DAP StARR program will allow two residents from the Departments of Medicine
and Neurology at MGH to conduct research for 12-24 months at MGH or the Marcus Institute of Aging Research at Hebrew
Senior Life Institute of Aging. The program will be co-led by Christine Ritchie (Medicine), Bradley Hyman (Neurology),
and Jatin Vyas (Medicine Residency Program Director), an Internal Steering Committee, and External Advisory Board,
along with 64 multidisciplinary and NIA-funded research preceptors. Together, these initiatives are designed to attract,
train, and retain MDs in biomedical investigation in the areas of ADRD, frailty, and multimorbidity in aging at the
most critical juncture of their career - residency training."
10813092,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sepsis is a significant public health concern with substantial financial burden in the USA. Mortality is alarmingly
high in sepsis recurrence. Whether by trauma or nosocomial infection, microbes can give rise to uncontrolled
infectious inflammation that impacts millions. Therefore, a deeper knowledge is needed of the endogenous
resolution mechanisms as well as their potential failure(s) to resolve sepsis. The acute inflammatory response
is protective; yet, when uncontrolled, inflammation is associated with many diseases, trauma, and surgical
interventions that can lead to sepsis and loss of life. Resolution of inflammation was widely held to be a
passive response and today is considered an exciting and essentially untapped terrain for new interventions.
In self-limited inflammation, the PI first mapped and elucidated the structures, biosynthesis and functions of
novel families of resolution phase mediators collectively termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM).
The SPM superfamily include lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins where each family is proven to
actively stimulate the resolution of inflammation, infections and are organ protective (i.e. lung, heart,
neuroprotective) in pre-clinical animal models. In human tissues, cellular and molecular understanding of
resolution programs for infectious inflammation is critically needed to harness the endogenous chemical
signals that resolve innate responses to bacterial challenge. SPM target both human neutrophils and
macrophages that are central in initiating the inflammatory response for defense as well as its timely resolution.
 In this R35 MIRA application, the PI shall focus on addressing critical gaps and challenges in the field of
resolution of inflammation relevant to human infectious inflammation, sepsis and recurrence. The main
overarching question and challenge to be addressed focuses on the general mission of determining whether
failed resolution mechanisms in inflammation contribute to poor outcomes in sepsis or its recurrence and to
identify these new components. This information is critically needed and must be obtained from accessible
human tissues such as blood so that they can be swiftly implemented. Results from these will help stratify and
shape the basis of new strategies for monitoring resolution mechanisms and pathways as well as their
potential failure in human sepsis. Addressing these fundamental questions on the resolution of inflammation is
the thrust of this MIRA application and are designed using new innovative approaches and technologies in
place in the PI’s laboratory from NIGMS support. The PI has a record of innovation, and the flexibility of a
MIRA will enable obtaining critical new information on mechanisms of SPM in resolution of infectious
inflammation needed in the long-term, to carry out well-informed new treatment approaches for sepsis and
other maladies that involve and will require taking into account resilience and the resolution response in
inflammation."

 This proposal involves the development of an implanted health monitoring device, the ""Lifeline""
device, which senses health-related parameters, including temperature, electrocardiogram,
photoplethysmogram, inertial measurement, and acoustic signals. We propose to enhance our existing
modular neuroprosthetic system, the ""Networked Neuroprosthesis"" (NNP), with the Lifeline device, creating
a comprehensive health monitoring system. The NNP System has already begun clinical evaluation in
individuals with SCI for providing motor function, but currently lacks health monitoring capability. We are
designing the Lifeline device as an integral component of the NNP system because the NNP system provides
an existing source of implanted power, significant processing capacity, wireless data transmission, data
storage, and an array of existing modules (electrical stimulation, biopotential recording, temperature
sensing, inertial sensing). Thus the NNP system provides a platform for implementing and evaluating the
benefits of implanted health monitoring while minimizing the development costs and regulatory hurdles.
As designed, the Lifeline component adds minimal additional risk with respect to surgical implantation and
system operation.
 An exciting anticipated outcome of the Lifeline-enhanced NNP System is the capacity to provide
advanced warning regarding the top causes of increased mortality in individuals with SCI, enabling earlier
detection and medical intervention that may ultimately increase overall life expectancy. The causes of early
mortality include pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), pulmonary embolism (PE), and autonomic
dysreflexia (AD), which are unique to, or more prevalent in, people with SCI (particularly tetraplegia). The
addition of the Lifeline device to the NNP System is the first step towards an implantable ""life-saving
neuroprosthesis"". The overall benefit of the Lifeline-enhanced NNP System for SCI is twofold: 1) the high
expectation of a functional benefit from the motor neuroprosthesis (original NNP System), and 2) the
potential life-extending features of the implanted health monitoring (Lifeline). At the completion of this
project, we anticipate having a single modular system that will be capable of providing both improved health
and improved function for anyone with SCI, thus prolonging life while, at the same time, increasing
independence and quality of life."

Economic choice behavior is specifically disrupted in mental disorders such as frontotemporal dementia, major
depression and drug addiction. To shed light on these diseases and to pave the way for treatments, it is critical
to understand the neural underpinnings of this behavior. In this respect, the past 15 years witnessed very
significant progress. Evidence from clinical data, lesion studies, functional imaging and neurophysiology links
economic choice to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In particular, work in my lab examined the activity of OFC
neurons in monkeys choosing between different juices. We thus identified three populations of cells intimately
related to choices: offer value cells encoding individual offer values, chosen juice cells encoding the binary
choice outcome, and chosen value cells. In a recent breakthrough, we used electrical stimulation to show that
offer values encoded in OFC are causal to choices. Together with work from other labs, our results lay the
foundations for a satisfactory understanding of economic choices. However, at least three major questions
remain open. (1) It is unclear where in the brain and how value comparisons (i.e., decisions) take place. (2) It is
unclear where and how offer values are first computed (or “constructed”). (3) It is unclear whether offer values
represented in other brain regions – such as the amygdala – are also causal to choices. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to address these fundamental questions. All the experiments will be conducted in non-
human primates. Using a combination of behavioral manipulation, neuronal recordings, electrical stimulation
and computational techniques, we will pursue two Specific Aims.
Under Aim 1, two experiments will examine whether neurons in the OFC participate in value comparison. The
cell groups identified in this area represent both the input (offer value) and the output (chosen juice, chosen
value) of the decision process, suggesting that they constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Exp.1
will assess whether the three cell groups are stable across choice conditions. In parallel, Exp.2 will use
electrical stimulation to assess whether neuronal activity in OFC is necessary for value comparison. Under
Aim 2, we will examine whether and how three brain regions interconnected with OFC – gustatory cortex (GC),
inferotemporal cortex (IT) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) – are involved in the choice process. A working
hypothesis is that GC and/or IT might participate in the construction of offer values. Two experiments will test
this hypothesis by recording neuronal activity from these two areas. Work conducted in the previous cycle
found that neurons in BLA encode the same variables represented in OFC, with some differences. In the last
experiment, we will use electrical stimulation to assess (a) whether offer values encoded in BLA are causal to
choices and (b) whether BLA participates in the decision process. Fulfilling these Aims will significantly
advance our understanding of the neural circuits that underlie economic choices and that malfunction in mental
illness. Our track record and substantial preliminary results indicate a high likelihood of success."
10800710,"Project Summary
In aging neurons, the accumulation of key misfolded proteins into aggregates is a hallmark of many
neurodegenerative diseases. For example, pathological forms of TDP43 become mislocalized to the cytoplasm
and accumulate in aggregates in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer Disease-related
Dementias (ADRD). Highly intricate networks of enzymes called molecular chaperones combat these processes.
In ADRD, it is unknown how the chaperone networks fail against pathological forms of ADRD proteins such as
TDP43, FUS, and TAU. A major challenge to studying chaperone networks is the combinatorial complexity. The
canonical Hsp70 network consists of 54 Hsp40, 12 Hsp70, and 16 Hsp110 gene variants, creating a landscape
of 12,155 possible protein expression combinations. Unique combinations of the Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp110 proteins
are hypothesized to confer specificity for different misfolded proteins in the complex human proteome. This
hypothesis is widely accepted but it has never been directly tested due to technical limitations. This NIH K99/R00
proposal outlines a plan to directly test this hypothesis by building the first exhaustive map of a chaperone
network against the ADRD-associated proteins TDP43, FUS, and TAU. To achieve this goal, aim 1 will leverage
a new genetic technique developed by Dr. Edward Barbieri to express and study all 12,155 possible
combinations of the human Hsp40-Hsp70-Hsp110 network in yeast models of ADRD. The chaperones identified
as having activity against TDP43 in yeast will be further studied in aim 2 using human cells and in vitro assays.
With human cell models, Dr. Barbieri will study the effect of the TDP43-active chaperones on cytoplasmic TDP43
aggregation and assess if the chaperones restore native TDP43 function in mRNA splicing in both HEK-293T
cells and neurons. Using in vitro biochemistry, he will measure chaperone activity for prevention and reversal of
TDP43 aggregation. During the R00 phase in aim 3 Dr. Barbieri will apply the chaperone network screen to study
the TAU aggregation and he will expand the chaperone networks studied in yeast by including Hsp40 pairs and
small HSPs. Lastly, Dr. Barbieri will combine the skills he learns during the K99 phase to develop a screen for
combinatorially overexpressing all 194 human chaperones directly in human cell models of ADRD to study
proteostasis networks in the native context. Together, the experiments outlined in this proposal will identify key
chaperones as therapeutic targets for ADRD. Dr. Barbieri will perform the K99 phase mentored in the Shorter
lab at the University of Pennsylvania, a world class biochemistry lab with expertise in the study of chaperones
and ADRD. This is an ideal training setting for Dr. Barbieri to acquire new skills in biochemistry. Furthermore,
Dr. Barbieri assembled an advisory committee to provide expertise in ADRD and formal training in the human
cell assays. The new skills will complement his current expertise in molecular genetics, and his outlined training
plan will provide the necessary preparation for Dr. Barbieri to progress to his goal of an independent position."
10751043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and costly mental health disorder. A potentially important
contributor to MDD is impaired reward-based reinforcement learning (RBRL). RBRL are a set of processes
reflecting difficulty learning which actions are likely to lead to rewarding outcomes, and are clinically significant
features of MDD that predicts future depressive symptoms and worse treatment response. MDD, however, is
heterogeneous and RBRL may relate to particular MDD symptoms - specifically psychomotor retardation
(PmR), a vastly understudied but impairing aspect of MDD that may be especially detrimental for RBRL. Despite
overlapping neural circuitry between PmR and RBRL, no study has assessed the impact of PmR on RBRL-
related behavior and neural activity in MDD. This is a critical question, as the degree to which RBRL is impaired
and which RBRL processes are altered in MDD may depend on PmR. Furthermore, this is highly clinically
relevant as ameliorating RBRL deficits related to PmR in MDD may depend on targeting specific RBRL
processes. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed K23 is to clarify the role of PmR on RBRL deficits in MDD
using innovative computational modeling to parse specific RBRL processes and fMRI. Building on an ongoing
R01 (PIs: Dr. Shankman, Mittal, Walther [mentors on this K23]), Aim 1 will test whether experimentally
manipulating the demand for psychomotor speed impacts behavioral and neural indicators of RBRL in individuals
(ages 18-60) with MDD (N=66) vs. healthy controls (N=44). Aim 2 will test whether a fine-grained laboratory
assessment of PmR in MDD predicts behavioral and neural indicators of RBRL, and whether associations
between PmR and RBRL are stronger when faster psychomotor speed is required. Aim 3 will examine whether
PmR-related RBRL impairment in MDD predicts the course of depression over 1-year. The proposed career
development award also aims to provide Dr. Letkiewicz with experiences and training activities that will support
her goals of increasing her knowledge of (1) the neural and behavioral basis of psychomotor functioning in MDD,
(2) advanced computational modeling to assess reinforcement learning in the context of psychomotor symptoms,
(3) multimethod RDoC approaches to studying mechanisms of psychopathology, and (4) grantsmanship and
mentorship skills. Her training goals will primarily be accomplished through formal didactics, training with her
mentorship team, and the interdisciplinary centers and institutes at Northwestern University. Her mentorship
team consists of leading experts in MDD and transdiagnostic research (Dr. Shankman), reinforcement learning
and computational modeling (Dr. Kahnt), neuroimaging and motor systems (Dr. Mittal), and psychomotor
assessment (Dr. Walther), all of whom have all have active NIH grants and an excellent track record of mentoring
early career scientists. This award will prepare Dr. Letkiewicz to submit an R01 grant application and provide
her with the skills needed to achieve her long-term career goal of examining the unique and combined
contribution of cognitive and motor systems to psychopathology as an independent clinical scientist."

Despite being one of the largest racial minority groups in the United States (U.S.), Black individuals experience
striking health disparities, particularly in terms of drinking-related outcomes. One possible reason for this is that
Black individuals in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by stressful life conditions, including race-based
discrimination, which may lead to higher rates of hazardous drinking. Subtle race-based discrimination at the
daily level, known as racial/ethnic microaggressions (MAs), is common among Black persons, and may be an
under recognized factor that accounts for significant and unique variance in alcohol use motivation and
hazardous drinking. The goal of this R21 project, which is in direct response to PA #20-195, is to elucidate the
role of MAs in hazardous drinking and alcohol use motivation among Black individuals using time sampling
methodology (over the course of 21 days). Participants (N=100; 50% female) will be Black adults meeting
criteria for current hazardous drinking. Further, the present proposal will determine whether negative affect
(e.g., anxiety, depression, anger) in response to MA accounts for the relation between MAs and alcohol use
motivation (i.e., greater alcohol craving, intention to drink, and coping-oriented motives for alcohol use) and
drinking (i.e., greater alcohol consumption, greater frequency of drinking, and more negative consequences
from drinking), and test theoretically driven culturally relevant resilience factors, including religiosity and ethnic
identity, and positive coping strategies. This proposal can significantly advance our knowledge of precursors to
alcohol misuse and related problems within the Black community and provide critical insight for future
prevention and intervention programs. The proposed research project supports the 2022-2026 proposed
strategic plan of the National Institute of National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) by
addressing cross-cutting themes such as: (1) promoting health equity and enhance diversity and inclusion in
the alcohol research enterprise, and (2) advancing research on co-occurring conditions (in this case, race-
based stress and associated negative affect) that interact with alcohol misuse; it further addresses the strategic
plan’s goal to “identify and track the biological, social, environmental, and behavioral causes and
consequences of alcohol misuse.” Further, the proposed project is in line with NIH’s UNITE initiative’s aim to
support “new research on health disparities, minority health, and health equity”."
10848200,"The overall mission of this research program is to determine how the antioxidant enzyme, extracellular
superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD or SOD3) regulates redox-sensitive signaling pathways responsible for
inflammation and fibrosis in pulmonary vascular diseases across the age span, and harness this knowledge to
design new and precise therapies. The different research projects are based on three complementary themes.
Theme 1 interrogates the regulation of SOD3 expression, activity and distribution in the healthy and diseased
pulmonary circulation in the mature and immature lung. These studies would include in vitro, and in vivo
studies using animal models, as well as activity translating the work through new human studies. They will
address the multiple levels of SOD3 regulation, including genetic polymorphisms, epigenetic regulation, or
other post-translation SOD3 modifications, that can influence gene expression, enzyme activity, half-life and
localization. Theme 2 evaluates how changes in SOD3 activity or binding properties impact redox sensitive
signaling pathways that are responsible for the development of pulmonary vascular disease, in particular,
inflammation and subsequent vascular remodeling and fibrosis. These experiments utilize a unique series of
SOD3 mouse strains, including a mouse with knock-in of a known human SOD3 polymorphism, to interrogate
how individual changes in SOD3 location or content can influence disease pathogenesis and severity. Based
on the unique extracellular localization of SOD3, studies will test the effects of insufficient SOD3 on matrix
integrity, matrix-cell interactions, cell-cell interactions and communication between extracellular signals and
intracellular cellular responses. Ongoing studies are testing how the loss of vascular SOD3 increases the
susceptibility of two key redox-sensitive targets localized to the extracellular matrix (ECM): activation of latent
TGF-β, which enhances PASMC and fibroblast growth, inflammation and synthetic function, or oxidative
fragmentation of hyaluronan, which binds to macrophage CD44 receptors and activates the NLRP3
inflammasome. Future planned studies will test how altered SOD3 impacts the redox landscape to modulate
innate immunity, cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction responsible for vascular fibrosis in PH.
Theme 3 translates the findings into new therapeutic strategies to replenish deficient SOD3 to restore redox
homeostasis. This framework is supported by a new initiative, funded by a Dean's Strategic Infrastructure
Research Committee Award for the purchase of an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, to develop
a collaborative and interdisciplinary UCD Redox Biology Shared Resource Facility to advance the study of
Redox Biology. These studies collectively will provide new insight relevant to the mission of the Precision
Medicine Initiative, as they will uncover how individual variables that influence SOD3 impact the development
of inflammation and fibrosis in pulmonary hypertension."

Acquisition of the TH2 suppressor program specializes Treg cell function in preventing the development of allergic
airway inflammation associated with asthma. Airway allergic responses arise when there is ineffective
development of tolerance to normally harmless environmental antigens and activation of pro-allergic TH2
responses. Cooperation of Foxp3 with additional transcription factors is crucial for establishing this specific
function. Aside from the transcriptional regulation, reprogramming of cellular metabolism represents an important
regulatory mechanism underlying Treg cell homeostasis and function. However, it remains elusive how Treg
cells coordinate immune signaling and cellular metabolism with Treg cell functional specification in the control of
allergic airway disease (AAD). We recently demonstrated that liver kinase B1 (LKB1), an important regulator of
cellular metabolism, is indispensable for Treg cells in suppressing allergic airway inflammation. In our preliminary
studies, we found that loss of LKB1 resulted in impaired expression of BATF and function of IRF4 in Treg cells.
By generating a new mouse model with Treg-specific ablation of BATF, we revealed that BATF-deficient Treg
cells selectively lost their capabilities of restraining TH2-mediated lung inflammation. Moreover, we observed that
lung-resident Treg cells displayed higher levels of cellular triacylglycerols (TAGs) than splenic Treg cells from
mice with lung inflammation. Loss of LKB1 and BATF in Treg cells enhanced biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty
acids (UFAs) and TAGs, both associated with increased expression of SCD1 and DGAT2, the rate-limiting
enzymes for synthesis of UFAs and TAGs, respectively. Finally, suppressing SCD1 and DGAT2 reduced levels
of cellular lipids and concomitantly increased Foxp3 expression. We hypothesize that LKB1 signaling links
activation of a BATF/IRF4-dependent transcriptome and regulation of UFA and TAG biosynthesis with Treg cell
functional specification for the control of allergic airway disease. Specifically, we will test this hypothesis in two
specific Aims: (1) Determine how the LKB1-BATF/IRF4 axis orchestrates the TH2 suppressor program in Treg
cells for the control of allergic airway disease; (2) Determine if regulation of UFA and TAG biosynthesis alters
Treg cell function in preventing AAD. Studies from this application may advance our understanding of how Treg
cells coordinate transcriptional activation and regulation of lipid biosynthesis in orchestrating the TH2 suppressor
program and manifest therapeutic opportunities for treating AAD."

Compared to their urban counterparts, rural family dementia caregivers (CGs) face increased vulnerability to insomnia and
related health concerns (stress, inflammation, depression, anxiety, cognitive disturbance). Cognitive behavioral treatment
for insomnia (CBT-I) holds promise for improving insomnia and these related concerns, but is difficult to access in rural
areas. Our team developed brief telehealth CBT-I (tele bCBT-I) tailored for CGs (e.g., includes stress management/problem
solving) that improved sleep, arousal, mood, cognition and inflammation (small to large effects). While telehealth improves
accessibility, it is still burdensome for CGs due to inflexible scheduling and scarcity of trained therapists. Thus, more
research is needed. Web delivery would increase access and web CBT-I is efficacious in non-CG adults, but has not been
tested in rural CGs. Using the NIH Stage Model flexible framework and Medical Research Council recommendations, we
developed NiteCAPP (web translation of our tele bCBT-I protocol). Stage IA/B validation and testing show high feasibility
and acceptability, and improvements in sleep, arousal, mood, burden and cognition in a single arm pilot in rural CGs (n=5).
The proposed trial is the next logical step - Stage II testing in an RCT (n=100) to establish efficacy and further evaluate
feasibility and acceptability. The Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress provides a framework for our basic premise that
CGs experience insomnia, arousal and inflammation that prompt sympathetic activation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) disruption that have downstream negative effects on health. The proposed trial tests the novel hypothesis that
NiteCAPP will improve CG health, mood, burden and cognition by targeting their shared underlying mechanisms – sleep,
arousal and inflammation – thereby, returning sympathetic and HPA functioning to normal. Another novel aspect of the
proposed trial is inclusion of behavioral strategies to target the person with dementia’s (PWD) sleep. Outcomes will be
assessed at baseline, post-treatment and two follow-ups (6 and 12 months) and include CG sleep, arousal, inflammation,
health, mood, burden and cognition, and PWD sleep.
 The proposed study has four specific aims. Aim 1 focuses on the feasibility and acceptability of NiteCAPP and
WebSHE (sleep hygiene education – active web comparator). Aims 2 and 3 examine NiteCAPP’s effects (versus WebSHE)
on CG primary/mechanistic (sleep, arousal, inflammation) and secondary outcomes (health, mood, burden, cognition),
respectively. Because the PWD’s sleep impacts CG sleep, Aim 4 examines NiteCAPP’s secondary effects on PWD sleep
(objectively assessed). An Exploratory Aim examines the relationships between changes in CG primary and secondary
outcomes, and their potential mediators/ moderators.
Public Health Implications: Demonstration that rural CGs can use NiteCAPP to target sleep, arousal/stress, inflammation
and related health concerns has important implications for multiple stakeholders, including rural CGs, rural PWDs, their
families, clinicians and policymakers."
10888146,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer associated deaths in men in the United States. The first
line of treatment for men with advanced metastatic prostate cancer is hormone therapy. Although initial
responses are observed, unfortunately, the disease commonly recurs in its aggressive hormone therapy-
resistant form, which is largely responsible for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need
to define the mechanisms that drive the aggressive disease and develop novel strategies to overcome advanced
treatment-resistant prostate cancer.
We have recently shown that GSTP1 protein is significantly upregulated in treatment-resistant prostate cancer.
We have strong preliminary evidence suggesting that GSTP1 may play functional role in driving aggressive
prostate cancer and may represent a promising therapeutic target for the advanced disease. We have recently
demonstrated that GSTP1 is significantly elevated in hormone therapy-resistant prostate cancer and that
inhibition of GSTP1 suppresses prostate cancer growth.
The main goals of the proposed project are:
1) test the functional role of GSTP1 in advanced prostate cancer.
2) test the therapeutic potential of GSTP1 inhibition alone and in combination with cisplatin in aggressive
 prostate cancer in pre-clinical settings utilizing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NEPC.
3) Delineate the mechanism of action of GSTP1 in advanced prostate cancer.
Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to: 1) defining the role of GSTP1 in aggressive therapy-
resistant prostate cancer and 2) direct new strategies regarding novel therapeutic interventions to combat the
deadly form of the disease."
10806179,"Chronic use of commonly used migraine therapies can lead to medication overuse headache (MOH). This is a
paradoxical increase in severity of migraine-associated symptoms and headaches which are refractory to other
treatments. Currently, the first-line treatment for MOH is drug cessation. However, during this abstinence period,
patients continue to suffer from severe migraine, and a majority of MOH patients return to these medications
within the first year. Targeted therapies specifically for MOH would result in better headache management and
increased patient quality of life. One of the accomplishments of the previous funding cycle of this grant was to
test δ opioid receptor (δOR) agonists in multiple headache models, including models of MOH. We found that
δOR activation completely reversed cephalic allodynia induced by chronic medication treatment, revealing δOR
agonists as a novel therapeutic strategy for MOH. In the previous funding cycle, we also performed a large scale
unbiased peptidomic screen to identify overlapping mechanisms between chronic migraine and MOH. We
identified pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) binding through PAC1 receptor as a
potential link between these two disorders; and that the PACAPergic system may be distinctly involved in pain
facilitation by chronic medication exposure. Upon further analysis we also found that there is high co-expression
between δOR and PACAP or PAC1 in pain-processing regions, including in the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and
trigeminal complex. The overall goal of this renewal is to build upon these exciting findings and determine if δOR
agonists relieve migraine and MOH through inhibition of the PACAPergic system. In Aim 1, we will test G protein
biased δOR agonists in novel translationally significant models of cephalic MOH and determine if they cause
tolerance in this model. These studies will strengthen the evidence for drug development of δOR for MOH. In
Aim 2 we will map the co-expression of δOR with PACAP and PAC1 and use biochemical and
electrophysiological assays to investigate how δOR modulates PACAPergic signaling. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
generate conditional knockouts of δOR in PACAP and PAC1 expressing cells, which will reveal if the behavioral
effects of δOR agonists are regulated through PACAPergic signaling. The experiments proposed in this
application are highly innovative and use a multidisciplinary approach. They will provide important insight on the effectiveness of δOR agonist as a therapeutic target for MOH and headache disorders more broadly and will
determine if δOR agonists work through inhibition of the PACAPergic system. Further, the modulation of the
PACAPergic system by δOR may be fundamental to other δOR behavioral effects, including emotional
modulation and peripheral analgesia."

RNA is now recognized as a compelling therapeutic target because it lies upstream of all protein function and
has cellular roles that go beyond protein translation. Similar to proteins, RNA molecules can fold to create
complex tertiary structures that form binding pockets capable of specific small-molecule engagement.
However, compared to proteins, few small molecules have been rationally designed to target RNA. The central
challenges to developing RNA-targeting ligands are, first, the difficulty of identifying ligandable sites on RNA
and, second, the lack of direct strategies for converting ligand binding into functional perturbation of mRNA
stability, translation and regulation. Both of these challenges can be addressed by a new ligand-engagement
technology developed in our lab. This technology enables nucleotide-resolution capture of ligand-RNA
interactions via a high-throughput, cell-based screen of a small-molecule library versus an RNA library – the
cellular transcriptome. In preliminary work, the ligand-engagement technology has been validated with photo-
reactive probes in bacterial cells, and shown to be modular and applicable to diverse chemistries and biological
systems. The first goal of this training and research proposal is to extend the technology to human cells and to
develop chemistries that yield covalent adducts with RNA specifically at sites of RNA tertiary structures. The
second goal of this proposal is to characterize the effects of covalent modification on gene expression for a
subset of ligandable RNAs. Completion of these aims will create a concise strategy for linking small molecule
engagement with RNA to direct functional modulation of gene expression. This multi-disciplinary project
emphasizes training in the fields of technology development, RNA biology, and bioinformatics. Expertise in
these fields, combined with my previous experiences as a chemical biologist and proteomicist, will position me
at the forefront of RNA-targeted therapeutics development. I envision using this training as a launching point
for an independent career as a scientific investigator and visionary leader with a research agenda focused on
developing new technologies that modulate RNA function and impact human health."
10809765,"Project Summary
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable bone marrow (BM) cancer characterized by the production of
monoclonal protein (MP). Development of drug resistance and off-target effects limits the efficacy of currently
available agents. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies, including drug delivery strategies, are urgently
needed. We have focused on the novel strategy of targeting the trafficking of MP in MM cells by inhibiting the
enzyme geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS). GGDPS inhibitors (GGSIs) disrupt Rab
geranylgeranylation, which results in intracellular MP accumulation, ER stress, induction of all three arms of
the unfolded protein response pathway and ultimately MM cell death. Our GGSI development efforts have
focused on isoprenoid triazole bisphosphonates and our structure-function studies have determined that
isoprenoid chain length and stereochemistry impact inhibitor potency as well as in vivo biodistribution.
Preclinical studies with our lead GGSIs have demonstrated key drug-like properties, including metabolic
stability, prolonged plasma half-life, systemic distribution, in vivo disruption of protein geranylgeranylation and
anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse MM xenograft model. Dose-finding and toxicology studies revealed hepatic
toxicity as dose-limiting with no effects on hematologic, renal, cardiac or neurologic function. Our preliminary
studies revealed that altering the molecular weight of a hyaluronic acid (HA) polymer can limit hepatic uptake
and enhance BM uptake and that MM cells readily take up HA. We therefore hypothesize that the therapeutic
potential of GGSIs can be optimized via linkage of our GGSIs to HA polymers, thus enhancing delivery of
GGSI to the BM and minimizing hepatic uptake and our preliminary studies support this hypothesis. To this
end, we will synthesize novel GGSIs that are are based upon our lead compound but either modified at the α-
position to allow conjugation to HA or linked to HA through phosphonate prodrug forms (Aim 1) We will perform
detailed structural studies, including protein crystallography studies with bound inhibitors, to clarify the
mechanisms by which these GGSIs interact with the target enzyme (Aim 1) which will aid in the design of
future generations of GGSIs. We will determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and
biodistribution patterns of the novel linkable GGSIs and the corresponding HA polymer conjugates (Aim 2). We
will investigate the mechanisms regulating GGSI hepatic uptake and toxicity. The efficacy of the lead GGSI-HA
conjugates will be assessed in xenograft studies which model extramedullary and medullary disease
involvement (Aim 3). In vitro and in vivo studies evaluating the combination of GGSI therapy with clinically used
anti-MM agents will be performed. While our current focus is to develop GGSI therapy for treatment of MM,
these studies have added significance because this novel approach of drug conjugation to HA to alter
biodistribution could be applied to the delivery of other clinically relevant agents for treatment of MM."
10885900,"Thus project addresses a gap in the available interventions for Veterans with Diabetic
Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN), a large and growing chronic disease population within the VHA.
Individuals with diabetes have a 10-times higher risk of amputations than the general
population. We expect that discrete, meaningful sensations perceived to be arising from the
missing foot can be chronically elicited by multi-contact peripheral nerve cuff electrodes
installed on the nerves in the thigh above the knee of Veterans with lower-limb loss due to
DPN. We anticipate that these electrically elicited sensations can maintain the health and
resiliency of the residual limb and provide meaningful feedback during daily activities. We will
rigorously document medical and medication history, and the interactions of the ongoing
disease with the implanted components, and expect them to be well tolerated by volunteers
with minimal clinical complications.
 Amputees pay less attention to their feet, are at risk for complications affecting the skin and
underlying tissues of their residual limb due to routine prosthetic socket use. We expect that
eliciting sensation perceived as arising from the missing foot via neural stimulation will improve
the health of the residual limb tissues of Veterans with limb loss due to DPN, and make them
more resilient to potentially damaging loads. That is, circulation and residual limb tissue health
will improve, and the likelihood of developing complications will decrease with the restoration
of appropriate sensation. Therefore, physiological measures of blood flow, temperature,
transcutaneous oxygen and other indicators of underlying tissue health, as well as the and
frequency and severity of phantom pain will change as a result of this unique intervention.
 The sensations perceived as related to physical interactions of the prosthesis with the
environment elicited with neural stimulation will also improve standing balance, walking
mechanics, and overall confidence and activity levels of Veterans with lower-limb loss due to
DPN. Standing balance and sway, and the ability to adapt to challenging or changing
environments, as well as subjective assessments of attention, balance confidence and fear of
falling measured with and without sensory stimulation. We further anticipate that recipients of
our Sensory Neuroprosthesis who have DPN will find it valuable in the home and community
as evidenced by patterns of usage, total standing and walking time, and subjective ratings of
satisfaction and effort. We expect users to have increased mobility, and cope more effectively
with disturbances to gait and balance.
 We will recruit and enroll a total of five new participants who will receive the surgically
implanted systems, and act as their own historical (pre- and post-implantation) and concurrent
(with and without sensory stimulation) controls. The Sensory Neuroprosthesis previously
developed by our group for traumatic trans-tibial amputees consisting of a wireless pressure
sensitive insole and external neural stimulator will be adapted for the unique clinical needs of
Veterans with DPN to deliver stimulation to the nerve via selected nerve electrode contacts at
the appropriate intensity corresponding to physical input to the foot. The successful
completion of this project will yield the information required to define the requirements for the
design of a self-contained system for Veterans with limb loss due to DPN that will be suitable
for larger scale clinical trials or commercially-sponsored projects."

Taste loss can lead to malnutrition, weight loss, and depression. In addition, changes in taste are a symptom of
poor health. This cyclical relationship between taste and health highlights the importance of research aimed at
understanding taste loss in both health and disease. Research on taste loss will provide new approaches in the
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. It is well-documented that infections and autoimmune
conditions are accompanied by changes in chemosensory perception including changes in taste. However,
currently we know little about how taste bud regeneration is regulated, and there is no effective treatment for
taste loss. Our recent research indicates that inflammation, characterized by induction of inflammatory
cytokines and infiltration and activation of immune cells, contributes significantly to taste dysfunction. We
hypothesize that inflammation, particularly through the action of the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ),
contributes to taste loss by inducing cell death and inhibiting taste bud cell renewal, and that resolution of
inflammation promotes taste bud regeneration. IFN-γ can be produced by various types of immune and
nonimmune cells in response to infections and autoimmunity. Its levels in taste tissues are markedly increased
in an autoimmune disease model with taste loss. Yet, whether IFN-γ directly contributes to taste loss has not
been determined. In this project, we propose to investigate the role of inflammation, especially IFN-γ, in taste
loss using both a transgenic approach and a clinically relevant respiratory viral infection model. We will then
use these taste loss models to study the mechanisms of taste bud regeneration. This research will test
mechanistic hypotheses of how inflammation and infection cause taste loss, and how taste responses recover.
To underscore the importance of research investigating the link between inflammation, disease, and taste loss,
a considerable number of COVID-19 patients experience taste dysfunction. Although most cases of taste loss
are temporary, including taste loss associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, long-term taste loss can occur in
some patients. Thus, insights from this research will be informative to better understand taste loss in general,
as well as taste loss associated with COVID-19."

Project Summary
Toward urinary catheterization with long-term resistance to bacterial colonization
Problem: Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI) are one of the most common
infections in hospitals and health care facilities. A study of urinary catheterisation involving over 9
million hospitalized patients found 12.9% were catheterised overall, but 72.9% were catheterized
in critical care. A long list of those who are susceptible to CAUTIs include those who are disabled
and the elderly and infirm with longer catheter indwelling times. Because of anatomy, women are
more susceptible to CAUTIs (~75%) compared to men (~25%). Increased antibiotic resistance,
and the increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are serious threats in
view of the decreased pipeline of antibiotics. Solution: To fight CAUTIs, WynnVision LLC is
developing a new approach by introducing a robust surface component for silicone Foley
catheters that reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. With discovery of “WynnGard-
1” silicone in 2010, WynnVision redirected research activities during Phase II. Patented
WynnGard-1 technology is novel compared to prior technologies that leach heavy metals or
antimicrobials. With no depletion of a leached agent, WynnGard-1 has the potential for long term
antimicrobial effectiveness. Challenge: A response from FDA to a WynnVision Pre-Request For
Designation in December 2021 posed questions that require experimental studies concerning
safety and efficacy. This Phase IIB proposal addresses FDA concerns that are embodied in
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Demonstrate negligible or undetectable leaching from WynnGard-1 silicone
with in vitro studies exceeding the maximum timeframe of patient use; Aim 2. Demonstrate
reduction of bacterial colonization in media comparable to human urine; Aim 3. Animal studies to
evaluate antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility; Aim 4. Establish a pathway to partnership for
licensing and manufacturing. WynnVision is confident in providing information to FDA that will
merit the designation “device” for WynnGard-1 silicone by FDA Office of Combination Products
and requirements for approval of a 510(k) application to the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (CDRH). The proposed Phase IIB research and FDA actions will de-risk the technology
and make WynnGard-1 silicone attractive for commercialization. Impact: Low cost WynnGard-1
silicone will make this CAUTI-fighting technology widely available for all."
10747340,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD8 T cells are critical for immune surveillance of both intracellular pathogens and cancer. Chronic and acute
antigen exposure entails distinct differentiation trajectories of CD8 T cells. In acute infection, naïve CD8 T cells
that recognize antigen undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into either cytotoxic effectors or quiescent
central memory cells (Tcm) that mediate rapid responses to subsequent infections. In settings of chronic
antigen exposure, such as cancer, CD8 T cells instead differentiate into to terminally exhausted (TEX) cells. TEX
have attenuated proliferative, cytokine-secretory, and cytolytic functions relative to the effector cells elicited by
acute infection. Although they still exert a significant level of viral control, TEX are unable to sustain durable
responses and require constant replenishment from a pool of quiescent, stem-like T progenitor exhausted
(TPEX). Importantly, immune checkpoint blockade therapy acts on TPEX to mobilize T cell responses to tumor
antigens. Despite the therapeutic imperative to elicit Tcm in response to vaccination and TPEX in responses to
cancer, the molecular mechanisms by which these T cell subsets develop are incompletely understood. It is
known that the transcription factor (TF) TCF-1 is required for both Tcm and TPEX populations and is
downregulated during the differentiation of effector and exhausted CD8 T cells. Although pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-12 are known to induce the downregulation of TCF-1 (encoded by Tcf7), it is
unclear how these extracellular cues are integrated to regulate TCF-1 expression during the fate decisions of
effector and TEX differentiation. It is also incompletely understood how TCF-1 contributes to the establishment
of unique transcriptional profiles of TPEX and Tcm despite the dependency of both cell subsets on this TF. The
proposed study seeks to address these gaps in knowledge by testing the central hypotheses (1) that self-
amplification of IL-2 receptor signaling through upregulation of the IL-2R alpha chain (Il2ra) promotes
downregulation of TCF-1 by direct repression of Tcf7 by the IL-2-inducible TFs AP4 and Blimp1 and (2) that
differential engagement of TLE family co-repressors and intrinsic HDAC activity by TCF-1 in TPEX and Tcm result
in subset-specific transcriptional regulation by TCF-1. The research project will interrogate the necessity of IL-
2R self-amplification in terminal differentiation by ablating IL-2R signaling-responsive cis-regulatory elements in
the Il2ra and Tcf7 loci in mouse models of chronic and acute infections. The requirements of TLE co-repressor
recruitment and HDAC activity in TPEX and Tcm will be interrogated by complementing Tcf7-deficient CD8 T cells
with Tcf7 mutants deficient in either HDAC or TLE co-repressor binding activity and infecting mice with chronic
or acute LCMV. The proposed research project is expected to advance the long-term objective of determining
the molecular basis by which Tcm and TPEX fate decisions are made, with the ultimate goal of engineering
durable CD8 T cell responses to infection and cancer."
10786057,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) contributes to an estimated 5 million deaths worldwide each year and is directly
responsible for over 1.2 million deaths. In the not-to-distant future, we may face a reality where infections
resistant to all existing antibiotics are commonplace. Therefore, addressing antimicrobial resistance by
developing antibiotic-sparing therapeutics is an urgent global health concern. Urinary tract infections (UTI)
drive over 15% of all antibiotic prescriptions and directly contribute to the development of AMR bacteria. One
potential antibiotic-sparing therapeutic for UTIs is monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which have been
successfully deployed for decades and have a strong history of safety and efficacy. The objective of this
proposal is to develop mAbs to two types of UTIs that greatly contribute to global disease burden. The overall
hypothesis is that mAbs to bacterial pilus adhesin proteins will block adhesin-ligand interactions and thus
prevent bacterial adherence to host tissues. In Aim 1, mAbs will be explored as a treatment for catheter-
associated UTI (CAUTI) caused by two pathogens that are frequently multi-drug resistant: Enterococcus
faecalis and Acinetobacter baumannii. These bacteria cause CAUTI by using sticky adhesins to bind to
fibrinogen deposited on the surface of urinary catheters. mAbs will block this interaction to prevent catheter
colonization. In Aim 2, mAbs will be tested for their ability to block bacterial interaction with host tissue.
Uropathogenic Escheriscia coli (UPEC) frequently causes highly recurrent UTI (rUTI) in part by establishing
reservoirs in the gastrointestinal tract and vagina that serve as a source for UPEC’s continuous reintroduction
into the bladder lumen. While the adhesins responsible for gut colonization have been characterized, the
adhesin responsible for vaginal colonization is unknown. Based on existing data suggesting a role for the
UPEC S pilus in the vagina, the contribution of this pilus to vaginal colonization will first be elucidated. mAbs
will then be generated to the S pilus adhesin and tested for their ability to deplete UPEC from the vagina. The
long-term goal of the proposed research is to generate mAbs that can treat human urinary tract infections.
During the fellowship, the applicant will develop important skills for becoming an independent investigator of
infectious diseases. The sponsor of this work, Dr. Scott Hultgren, has vast experience studying urinary tract
infection pathogenesis and treatment, and the institutional environment provides supportive, collaborative
experts in microbiology and immunology. Washington University School of Medicine has a long history of
helping physician-scientists build successful careers. The proposed training plan will facilitate the applicant’s
transition into becoming an independent physician-scientist, using research to improve women’s health."
10829207,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a skeletal muscle disease hallmarked by muscle weakness with an incidence of 1
in 50,000 live births. On histopathology, there is an obvious presence of actin accumulations in disrupted muscle.
The causative mutations identified thus far are in genes critical for actin filament structure within the muscle, yet
the molecular mechanisms for how alteration of these proteins leads to NM pathology is not well understood.
Cofilin-2, which is important for actin filament severing, is one such affected actin-binding protein. This cofilin
isoform is the predominant form in postnatal and mature skeletal muscle; its function has mainly been studied
with respect to actin at the sarcomere, the muscle’s main contractile unit. Cofilin-2 is known to biochemically
bind more readily to cytoplasmic non-sarcomeric actin than sarcomeric actin, but the impact of this characteristic
on NM progression has not been studied. A Drosophila model of muscle-specific cofilin (DmCFL) knockdown
was shown by our lab to have progressive muscular defects linked to sarcomere addition during growth. I
analyzed RNA sequencing data produced from muscle-enriched preparation of the DmCFL knockdown model
and found that genes associated with excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) are differentially expressed. ECC is
the process by which signals from the motor neuron are communicated to the muscle ultimately leading to
contraction. My preliminary data show disordered actin organization at the muscle side of the neuromuscular
junction (NMJ), which is where the muscle receives signals from the motor neuron. Based on the literature and
these preliminary findings, I hypothesize that cofilin regulation of non-sarcomeric actin is critical for the
proper NMJ and contraction machinery structure needed for ECC prior to muscle deterioration. To
address this hypothesis, I will use the DmCFL knockdown model to analyze the impact of decreased cofilin on
the NMJ signal transduction (Aim 1) and muscle contraction (Aim 2). The former will be accomplished by
using molecular, microscopy, and electrophysiological techniques to analyze changes in NMJ protein
localization, morphology, and function at the muscle (Aim 1A) and motor neuron (Aim 1B). I will compare the
morphological findings from Drosophila larval muscle to those from cofilin-2 knockout mouse muscle samples.
Contraction will be assessed using fluorescent imaging techniques targeted to the calcium signaling machinery
(Aim 2A). Using a modified exercise approach (Aim 2B), I will discover how exercise intensity influences
contraction and phenotype progression in DmCFL knockdown larva. These experiments will collectively provide
insight into the status of the NMJ and contractile activity in cofilin NM while leveraging the simplicity yet high
level of evolutionary conservation of Drosophila. In answering this question relevant to a clinical disease
that typically manifests early in life, I will further develop the technical skills and scientific reasoning
needed as a cell and developmental biologist. These studies will complement my clinical activities as I train
to become a well-rounded physician-scientist and independent investigator interested in pediatrics."
10834042,"An integrated single-neuronal, population-, local network- and stimulation-based
prefrontal investigation of human social cognition
This proposal aims to undertake a comprehensive single-cellular, population-, local circuit- and stimulation-
based evaluation of the role that the dorsal prefrontal cortex plays in human social cognition. Despite ongoing
progress in our understanding of basic elements of social behavior through animal models, astonishingly little
is known about the single-neuronal and causal mechanisms that underlie human social cognition. A core
network of areas comprising the dorsomedial prefrontal, dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex of
the frontal lobe has been suggested to play a critical role in human social behavior; sub-serving processes that
include emotional judgment, social reasoning and theory of mind. Unlike more basic sensorimotor processes,
these social processes require individuals not only to represent the observed behavior or actions of others but
to also infer their hidden internal states and beliefs which are inherently unobservable and unknown. These
higher-order social processes play a central role in human ontogeny and are broadly affected in psychosocial
conditions such as schizophrenia, depression and autism spectrum disorder. Yet, despite their importance,
extraordinarily little is known about how the activities of neurons in the human brain give rise to these diverse
social cognitive functions or what precise role specific prefrontal areas play. Building on our groups unique
combined experience in acute single-neuronal recordings from the these dorsal prefrontal areas, social
neuroscience and theory, population analyses, computational modeling and real-time stimulation techniques
and by using a novel structured multi-set social task, this proposal aims to address, for the first time, vital
questions about how social information is processed in humans at the cellular level, what specific cognitive
processes are engaged across cortical areas, whether these processes are dissociable from more generalized
cognitive mechanisms, how these key computations interrelate and, crucially, what causal contribution do
neural activities in these prefrontal areas play in human social cognition at the behavioral level. Together, this
systematic cross-modal, inter-disciplinary, multi-institutional collaborative effort promises to provide
unprecedented new insights into human social cognition at the cellular level and offer an innovative new
framework by which to investigate the prospective contribution of the dorsal prefrontal cortex to psychosocial
conditions such as autism spectrum disorder."
10896124,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of this project is to develop an implantable blood pump system as a total heart
replacement. The use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for destination therapy for end
stage heart failure is expanding. However, right ventricular failure occurs in 10-40% of LVAD
patients. We are developing a system using separate centrifugal left and right pumps with a
common controller. The right pump is based on a right heart replacement pump developed for
failing Fontan patients. It has unique double inlet ports to connect to the superior and inferior
vena cavae, allowing the pump to be placed in the position of the right atrium. The left pump is a
single inlet pump of similar design. Compared to currently available biventricular assist systems
and total artificial hearts, our approach will: 1) allow unobstructed fit in the anatomy of smaller
patients, 2) achieve reliable operation for at least 10 years, 3) automatically adjust left and right
pump output to respond to the varied physiologic needs of the patient 4) balance left and right
pump outputs to safely control left atrial pressure over a wide range of systemic and pulmonary
vascular resistances and central venous pressures, 5) provide pulsatile flow, 6) reduce the
incidence of thromboembolism and pump thrombosis, 7) preserve high molecular weight von
Willebrand factor to reduce the incidence of bleeding, and 8) provide a development path to a
completely implantable, wireless system. Specific Aim 1- Build a biventricular replacement
device to replace the failing heart, with the right heart placed in the bicaval position and a left
pump anastomosed to the left atrium remnant. Integration of pressure sensors in both pumps
will measure inlet pressures (equivalent to right atrial and left atrial pressures), which will be
used as inputs to the automatic control system. Specific Aim 2- Develop an automatic control
system capable of physiologic control of both pumps. The controller will increase right pump
output in response to increased venous return, which mimics the normal Frank-Starling cardiac
output response, and control left pump output to maintain left atrial pressure within a physiologic
range. The controller will also modulate pump speeds to produce pulsatile flow. Specific Aim 3-
Test and optimize the TAH in chronic animal studies to: A) Demonstrate automatic Starling-like
cardiac output control and automatic balance control of the pumps over a wide range of
physiologic conditions including exercise, and B) examine the biocompatibility of the device by
assessing thrombus formation, thromboembolism, von Willebrand factor degradation, and
intestinal angiodysplasia. We will study both pulsatile and non-pulsatile modes."
10846569,"There were over 1000 deaths during the 2017 hurricane season in the United States, with the majority
occurring in the territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). Over a third of post-disaster
mortality and morbidity was due to complications of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension,
diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. With the rising frequency of natural disasters, there is an urgent need for
feasible, acceptable, and effective emergency preparedness plans that will reduce morbidity and mortality
related to non-communicable diseases after disasters. This is especially true for underserved, under-insured,
minority populations that have historically suffered disproportionately after disasters. The proposed research
will leverage the unique access of Federally Qualified Health Centers to underserved populations in the U.S.
territories to develop both an organizational and disease-specific (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, heart failure)
emergency preparedness plan. To achieve this objective, the candidate will use a mixed methods approach to
evaluate existing emergency preparedness plans, engage key stakeholders to improve existing plans to
address the management of non-communicable diseases after a natural disaster, and conduct a pilot study to
test its feasibility and acceptability. This work will lay the foundation for developing a much-needed approach to
saving lives and to reaching those populations most in need after a natural disaster.
Dr. Hassan is a Medicine and Pediatrics trained physician whose research interest is in applying
implementation science tools to design, implement, and evaluate interventions to reduce disparities in
cardiovascular risk factors. She has worked with partners in the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the USVI for
the past 2.5 years as Deputy Director of an NIH/NIMHD funded U54 (U54MD010711; lead PI Nunez-Smith).
During this time, she has led a stakeholder engaged approach to implementing and evaluating a diabetes
prevention intervention in clinical settings in both the USVI and Puerto Rico. The goal of this K23 proposal is to
build on these experiences and provide Dr. Hassan with essential mentored training in mixed methods
research, systems science, and disaster planning. These skills will provide her with expertise in methods that
can be used to advance the field of implementation science and apply it to the pressing gaps in disaster
planning for chronic disease management. This will position her well for future independent funding; enabling
pursuit of her long-term goal of being an investigator with expertise in applying implementation science methods

The purpose of the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Annual American Society of Health Economists
(ASHEcon) Conferences is to enable the community of health economists, health services researchers, and
health policy researchers to gather and present research, exchange ideas, gain new skills, and learn about
current policy issues.. While we believe these conferences will contain aspects touching on all four types of
conference priorities highlighted by AHRQ, ours is primarily a research development conference.
The conference objectives are as follows:
1) To offer members of the health economics and health policy community in academia, government, contract
research organizations, and industry an opportunity to present and discuss high quality studies representing
new, rigorous, innovative research in important areas of health economics in an intensive large conference
setting. The central component of the conference is the dissemination of cutting edge, policy relevant research.
Many of the research papers that will be presented at ASHEcon’s conferences will focus on health and health
care disparities, as well as AHRQ priority populations.
2) To foster the development and implementation of methodologically rigorous approaches in the study of
policy significant empirical health economics and policy research.
3) To provide workshops to enhance the empirical skills and capabilities of health economists and related
researchers as well as to aid students in skill-development, and to facilitate the career development of the next
generation of health economic scholars through career development activities and awards across the career
spectrum.
4) To provide opportunities for health economists and the health policy community to engage with one another
and network to create, develop and foster connections for future research collaborations.
Anticipated outcomes include improved research through the exchange of new study findings, dissemination of
cutting-edge methods and crosscutting research ideas, better health policies, and the development of the next
generation of health economics and health policy researchers. The conference provides significant time for
networking and fostering collaboration among researchers. Evaluations of past ASHEcon conferences indicate
high marks on all dimensions.

Understanding mechanisms cells use to maintain cholesterol homeostasis are critical in cell biology and many
diseases. To achieve this, the chemical activity of cholesterol in cell plasma membranes must be measured
because activity controls cholesterol’s effects on cellular processes. To date, plasma membrane cholesterol
concentration has been used to quantify cholesterol activity. But the activity of cholesterol is determined by its
chemical potential; concentration contributes to, but does not accurately reflect membrane activity. Because a
method to measure cholesterol chemical potential had not been available, it was not possible to properly
evaluate many of cholesterol’s effects, including those on cellular signaling. We have now developed methods
to do so. These methods and a new perfusion fluorimetry apparatus we have devised allow us to follow the
chemical potential of cholesterol of plasma membranes in real time. We have discovered that cells quickly
respond to changes in extracellular cholesterol by adjusting the cholesterol chemical potential of their plasma
membranes without changing the total content of cellular cholesterol. This finding reveals a previously unknown
mechanism to maintain cholesterol homeostasis: quick adjustment of plasma membrane chemical potentials
to control cholesterol influx and efflux. We have identified protein scaffolded domains, as typified by caveolae,
as sites at which cells sense and rapidly respond to external cholesterol. The abundance and total amount of
cholesterol that resides in caveolae are determined by the extent of phosphorylation at position Ser80 of
caveolin-1, the foundational protein of the domain. The shuttling of cholesterol between scaffolded domains
and the surround which must result upon Ser80 phosphorylation alters cholesterol chemical potential. We
therefore hypothesize that signaling cascades initiated within scaffolded domains are responsible for
maintaining cholesterol homeostasis when cells are subjected to changes in external cholesterol and to growth
factors. We further posit that these activated signaling cascades feed back to the plasma membrane to maintain
chemical potentials. Cells will be stimulated with growth factors and relevant signaling cascades will be
identified. The abundance of caveolae will be assessed by measuring the FRET (fluorescence resonance energy
transfer) signals between caveolins. Our preliminary evidence strongly implicates that growth factors and/or
changes in the level of external cholesterol stimulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway that feeds back to
achieve cholesterol homeostasis. Optogenetic techniques will be used to determine whether it and/or others are
indeed responsible for control of cholesterol. Parallel experiments using the same strategies will determine if
flotillins, analogous to caveolin, also serve as sensors/regulators of cholesterol chemical potentials."

Cerebral malaria (CM) is defined as an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with Plasmodium falciparum
parasitemia. The condition is common, primarily affects African children less than five years old, and has a
large public health impact in endemic areas. Of the ~350,000 children diagnosed annually with CM, 15% die
and 30% of survivors have neurological abnormalities at the time of hospital discharge. The mainstay of
treatment is intravenous antimalarial drugs and supportive care. No adjunctive therapy has previously been
proven effective in decreasing the high rates of mortality and morbidity in this condition. Our long-term goal is
to establish feasible therapies that decrease death and disability rates in this vulnerable population.
We will investigate 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist, as a candidate adjunctive
therapy for pediatric CM. We identified DON through a rational drug discovery process and tested its efficacy
in several pre-clinical studies. Mice with experimental CM have radiographic and pathological abnormalities
similar to those seen in human pediatric CM; DON administered to mice that are severely clinically ill rescues
animals clinically, radiographically, and reverses abnormal histopathology. We will test DON’s safety and
preliminary efficacy in human pediatric CM. To do so, we will first perform a dose escalation study of DON in
healthy Malawian adults and adults with uncomplicated malaria, evaluating safety. After review, we will
perform a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind safety and preliminary efficacy study of adjunctive DON
in 70 Malawian children with CM. Participants in the first pediatric cohort (n=35) will receive lower doses of
adjunctive DON or placebo. Doses of adjunctive DON administered to the second cohort of pediatric
participants (n=35) will be informed by pharmacokinetic and safety data gathered from those previously
enrolled. Our primary outcome is the proportion of participants with any Grade 3 or severe adverse events
(SAEs). Concurrently with safety studies, DON’s preliminary efficacy in pediatric CM will be evaluated using
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and transcranial Doppler (TCD). We
hypothesize that Malawian children with CM who receive adjunctive DON will have no increase in mortality or
rates of SAEs compared to participants receiving placebo. We hypothesize that children with CM receiving
adjunctive DON will have biomarker changes (MRI, EEG, TCD) associated with improved outcome.
In summary, this research is significant because the adjunctive therapy, DON, when used in a murine model of
CM, reverses brain swelling, the most important risk factor for death in children with CM. If successful in
subsequent human clinical trials, this would be the first adjunctive therapy with a demonstrable effect on
decreasing death or disability in this patient population. We anticipate that with widespread dissemination of
such a scalable intervention, the public health impact of this devastating infectious disease would finally
decrease."

Lysosomes are sophisticated and dynamic cellular signaling centers that control metabolism, gene transcription,
calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, and autophagy. A key mechanism through which lysosomes communicate and
receive instruction is via transfer of cholesterol at ER–lysosome membrane contact sites. At these contacts the
Niemann Pick C1 cholesterol transporter (NPC1) facilitates the efflux of cholesterol out of the lysosome before
it is transferred to the ER for distribution to other cellular membranes. Thus, NPC1 is a key gatekeeper in
cholesterol metabolism. Further underscoring its importance, loss of function mutations in NPC1 lead to the
progressive neurodegenerative disorder, NPC disease. This fatal condition has no cure and is characterized by
the accumulation of cholesterol within lysosome lumen and the progressive neurodegeneration of several brain
regions that are accompanied by a host of devastating symptoms including seizures, psychiatric problems, and
dementia. Notwithstanding clear neuropathological consequences for cholesterol dysregulation in NPC disease,
the molecular mechanism(s) linking loss of NPC1 function to disease neuropathology are unknown. Recently
our group has reported that loss of NPC1 function results in (i) neuron hyperexcitability, (ii) reorganization of ER–
Lysosome, ER–Golgi, and ER–mitochondrial membrane contact sites, and (iii) induces neurotoxic increases in
mitochondrial Ca2+. Despite this crucial information there are critical gaps in our knowledge regarding (1) the
consequences of enhanced excitability in NPC disease, (2) how lysosomal cholesterol transport alters the
molecular elements and choreography at neuronal ER–plasma membrane (ER–PM) contact sites, and (3) if
plasma membrane ion channels or ER–PM junctions can be targeted to reduce mitochondrial toxicity and
increase neuron viability in NPC disease. Our central hypothesis is that loss of NPC1 function results in
aberrant remodeling of ion channel distribution and function at ER–PM contacts to drive cytotoxic increases in
mitochondrial Ca2+ leading to neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we implement a multi-scale approach,
including super-resolution imaging, electrophysiology, optical mapping of brain excitability, novel murine models,
and animal behavior testing to rigorously investigate the mechanisms by which cholesterol efflux from the
lysosome tunes neuron viability. The fundamental importance and ubiquitous expression of the NPC cholesterol
transporter means we should pay particular attention to molecular elements and signaling cascades that are
modified by its activity. Investigating the relationship between cholesterol homeostasis and ion channel signaling
at ER–PM membrane contacts in NPC provides a testable model for examining the interdependence of
lysosomal cholesterol and ion channel activity and has broad implications for several fields and other cholesterol-
linked diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s."

 Bacterial persistence is a robust mechanism employed by bacteria to survive antibiotic stress, and is
likely to be a major cause of chronic infections. Bacterial persisters are genetically indistinct from the rest of the
population, and likely emerge due to phenotypic variations that are inherently stochastic. Although all major
bacterial pathogens produce persisters, the mechanisms of persistence are poorly understood. Persisters do
not exhibit any discernible morphological differences from the rest of the cell population. This adds to the
challenges of studying how persisters emerge in natural bacterial populations. Among the known mechanisms
involve toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules, which dissipate the proton-motive force (PMF) and promote persister
formation. Persisters may also arise due to energetic deficiencies, which induce dormancy in cells. However,
persister populations are quite heterogeneous in many regards and identifying the mechanisms of persistence
will continue to remain challenging until the sources of heterogeneity are determined. In the proposed work, the
objective is to quantify the heterogeneity in the PMF of persisters and study key factors that influence fitness in
persister populations. The long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the stochastic
phenomenon governing persistence. The proposed work is innovative as it combines single-cell biophysical
assays including optical trapping with fluorescence techniques and quantitative image analysis – these tools
will be used to quantify the heterogeneities in the PMF that might prevail in persister populations of Escherichia
coli. The innovative approaches proposed will also help test correlations between the measured
heterogeneities and the occurrence of persistence under different antibiotic stresses. In particular, the central
hypothesis that low energy levels can predict the probability of persister formation will be tested. Successful
execution of this project will lay the foundation for future efforts to determine how bacterial energetics influence
persistence mechanisms. As persisters likely play a major role in clinical recurrence of disease, they are a
major burden on the public healthcare. This coupled with the emerging threat of antibiotic resistance makes the
proposed work timely and critical."

Neurons lack energy reserves and thus their survival depends on an uninterrupted, dynamically
regulated supply of blood-borne nutrients, which are delivered through a dense capillary network.
Precise control of the blood flow through the brain microcirculation is therefore essential for neuronal
health. However, the mechanisms through which blood is distributed within the capillary network
remains poorly understood. Furthering our understanding of this process is critical, as it is increasingly
appreciated that disruption of brain hemodynamics is one of the earliest pathological events in cerebral
small vessel diseases. Pericytes are mural cells that wrap around the endothelial cells forming the
capillaries. Our extensive preliminary data show for the first time that pericytes located on the first to
fourth order capillary branches constrict and relax in response to luminal pressure changes. This
observation implies that the resistance created by the capillary network is not constant and
homogeneous, but rather variable and dynamic, casting a new light on blood flow regulation.
Specifically, we have found that pressure-induced constriction in pericytes engages the autocrine
activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), subsequent inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
signaling, and transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3) activation. Using a well-established
genetic mouse model of CADASIL, a hereditary form of small vessel disease, we further propose that
pathogenic mechanisms depress the EGFR activation in pericytes, resulting in impaired capillary blood
flow autoregulation. To test these ideas, we engage a wide variety of novel, state-of-the-art experimental
approaches using intact animals, native tissue, and freshly isolated cells, complemented by
sophisticated computational modeling. Taking advantage of our newly developed pressurized arteriole-
capillary ex vivo preparation, Aim 1 will explore how EGFR activation by intraluminal pressure and
agonist-induced vasoconstriction contributes to γ1 phospholipase C (PLCγ1) activation and IP3-
dependent Ca2+ signals. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism linking EGFR and PLCγ1 activation to
TRPC3 channel opening to cause membrane depolarization and constriction. Finally, using
extracellular matrix disruptions characteristic of CADASIL as a framework, Aim 3 will provide the first
insights into the mechanisms by which pericyte contractility is regulated by EGFR and its upstream
regulators TIMP3, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, and ADAM17, a metalloproteinase that
mediates shedding of the EGFR ligand, HB-EGF. The proposed work has the potential to provide a
paradigm-shifting view on how pericytes control capillary blood flow distribution, and as such, should
provide the foundation for understanding small vessel diseases of the brain."

Urinary urgency incontinence (UUI) is one of the most common conditions to impact women,
and older women, in particular. When comparing women with and without urgency incontinence,
those with UUI have lower quality of life scores and higher rates of anxiety and depression.
While the incidence and prevalence of UUI has been well studied, the pathophysiology of the
disease is poorly understood. In the majority of cases, UUI is classified as idiopathic or “age-
related”. In these cases, there are likely numerous genetic, environmental, dietary, metabolic
and clinical factors and inter-factor interactions that lead to the development of UUI and these
interactions likely center around the disturbance of normal neural signaling which controls
micturition. Improving our understanding of how UUI develops in women without an overt clinical
condition and how the cholinergic signaling system is involved will likely contribute to an
individualized treatment paradigm for managing UUI as well as the development of novel
treatments. In this proposal we will use the robust longitudinal data present in the Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) and NHS II to classify the plasma levels of cholinergic metabolites in
women with and without. We will investigate whether non-cholinergic metabolites and single
nucleotide polymorphisms for UUI lead to this condition and how interactions between these
variables and cholinergic metabolites and clinical and demographic risk factors lead to the
development of UUI. We will also evaluate how dietary choline impacts the presence of
cholinergic metabolites, and whether this interaction is associated with expression of the UUI
phenotype."

Current therapies for opioid use disorder are focused on alleviating withdrawal symptoms
associated with cessation of opioid use, which has led to improved treatment outcomes. An
important emerging approach to tackling the opioid crisis focuses on prevention efforts. A better
understanding of the factors that contribute to the transition from the initial opioid exposure to
development of a substance use disorder is needed to improve existing preventative measures.
In this proposal, we combine rodent behavioral models of early life adversity, which are known to
influence addiction-related endophenotypes, with combined cell type-specific transcriptomics and
epigenomics to develop a more complete picture of the molecular signatures that are predictive
of resilience to substance abuse. The brain is highly heterogeneous and revealing the cell-type
specific changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility constitutes a potentially
transformative advance that can be leveraged to tailor pain management and initial opioid
treatments. The proposal focuses on the nucleus accumbens core, a brain region critical for
impulsivity and addiction-related behaviors. This grant lays to foundation for reducing the
transition from initial exposure to uncontrolled and compulsive use in individuals treated with
opioids. Deliverables under this award include detailed cell-type specific maps of the effect of
early life stress on the transcriptome and epigenome of the nucleus accumbens core and
identification of the neural cell types associated with human impulsivity, a reliable proxy for
addiction liability and susceptibility."

The childhood muscle cancer alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is generally not survivable when metastatic.
However, ARMS does usually respond clinically to chemotherapy initially. With respect to the cause of
recurrences, clinicians observe that the PAX3:FOXO1 oncogene present in most ARMS cases mediates
treatment resistance, causing a 45% drop in 10-year survival. In explanation, we reported that PAX3:FOXO1
facilitates G2/M checkpoint adaptation (tolerance of DNA breaks & mitotic catastrophe). Thus, the driving clinical
challenge is to overcome recurrence by counteracting PAX3:FOXO1. We published that PAX3:FOXO1 can be
pharmacologically silenced by entinostat, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor. We find entinostat dramatically
improves ARMS sensitivity to frontline chemotherapy. Mechanistically, our recently published studies implicate
an HDAC3 – SMARCA4 – miR-27a – PAX3:FOXO1 regulatory circuitry in ARMS. In parallel we have uncovered
that SMARCA4 expression is uniquely elevated in fusion positive ARMS, and that ARMS-selective SMARCA4
expression is a pivotal long-term susceptibility in tumor cell survival. These results point to SMARCA4 having a
key role in fusion positive ARMS – controlling PAX3:FOXO1 and chemotherapy sensitivity in the short-term and
tumor cell maintenance long-term. We hypothesize that PAX3:FOXO1+ ARMS can be made more
chemosensitive at relapse and less likely to recur by epigenetically silencing PAX3:FOXO1. Thus, our aims are
to: (1) Delineate the atypical role of SMARCA4 as an oncogene in ARMS via the SWI/SNF BAF complex,
and (2) Test efficacy of direct PAX3:FOXO1 inhibition versus upstream SMARCA4/A2 inhibition versus
entinostat when combined with relapse chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy agents. From these
results, we hope to understand rhabdomyosarcoma molecular underpinnings."

 Eating disorders and obesity are becoming increasingly severe in the United States, posing extensive
health and financial costs to those affected. Current treatments focus heavily on changes to diet and exercise,
with few interventions available targeting the neural circuitry underlying these disorders. The last few decades
of research have advanced our understanding of homeostatic feeding circuits, although much remains unclear.
Furthermore, homeostatic need is not the sole factor in the decision to consume food. Humans commonly
experience non-homeostatic motivators to eat, such as craving of sugary or fatty foods even when sated (i.e.,
“there is always room for dessert”). Neural representations of food availability and desirability are crucial in our
decision-making surrounding consumption. Neural circuits responsible for motivation and reward can promote
eating in the absence of nutritional deficit or homeostatic necessity, resulting in obesity or other eating disorders.
The goal of this work is to understand the neural circuits that drive feeding behavior, including both homeostatic
and non-homeostatic drives to feed.
 Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons are a relevant target for both homeostatic and non-
homeostatic motivators to eat. MCH neurons originate in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta, and project
to many areas throughout the brain, including feeding/reward areas like the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the
arcuate nucleus (ARC), as well as arousal areas like the locus coeruleus (LC). Interestingly, MCH neurons have
been implicated in a diverse array of behaviors including feeding, sleep, and learning. We hypothesize that
discrete MCH subpopulations promote specific behaviors via projections to different downstream areas.
Specifically, we hypothesize that MCH projections to NAcc or ARC will promote feeding and not sleep, while
MCH projections to LC will promote sleep and not feeding.
 This proposal aims to isolate the behavioral functions of specific MCH subpopulations by optogenetic
activation of MCH neuron terminals in discrete downstream areas (NAcc, ARC, LC). Using optogenetic
stimulation in combination with rigorous behavioral paradigms, observing both feeding and sleep behaviors, this
work will reveal how the MCH system promotes feeding in the absence of effects on arousal state. Furthermore,
this proposal aims to elucidate the motivational valence of MCH neuron activity, as well as its involvement with
homeostatic and non-homeostatic feeding, by allowing mice to voluntarily self-stimulate discrete MCH
projections with or without paired food delivery. By using cutting-edge approaches and behavioral analysis to
identify the role of MCH circuitry in feeding behaviors, we will increase understanding of the neural circuitry
behind maladaptive feeding and help to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of eating disorders
and obesity."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been extremely successful in identifying genetic loci
associated with complex diseases, but the causal tissue and functional mechanism underlying the association
at each locus is generally unknown. Recent work has shown gene expression across tissues can be used as
an intermediate phenotype to fill in these missing links between genotype and disease. An accurate mapping
from disease locus to the causal tissue and gene mediating that disease locus would further our understanding
of disease biology and provide novel insights into tissue-linked mechanisms of disease. However, accurate
inference of the causal tissue and gene driving a disease locus can be obscured by genetic co-regulation
(correlation among variant effects on gene expression) across tissues as well as genes. The first aim of this
proposal is to develop a new statistical method to accurately infer the causal tissue and gene driving a disease
locus, while explicitly modeling genetic co-regulation between tissues and genes. The second aim of this
proposal is to infer disease subtypes linked to specific tissues using tissue-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS)
generated by annotating disease loci according to their causal tissue type, utilizing the method developed in
the first aim. I expect tissue-specific PRS to uncover patterns of tissue-specific genetic risk across individuals
that correspond to different subtypes of the disease. If achieved, this work will refine our knowledge of causal
tissues and genes underlying disease loci, as well as provide a new paradigm for inferring the disease subtype
of each individual in a disease association study. More generally, this work has the potential to refine the set of
drug target candidate disease genes and facilitate the development of patient care and treatments specific to
disease subtypes. In addition, I propose an in-depth training plan that leverages the research community
throughout Harvard to provide me with the training and skills necessary to advance my career from a post-
doctoral fellow to an independent investigator."

Movements are influenced by motivation. Consider a basketball player shooting a free-throw. Depending on the
stakes of the outcome of the shot, performance can vary greatly. Top athletes rise to the challenge, and perform
better during a game than they do during practice. But when the stakes are inordinately high, like when the game
is on the line, even skilled players can “choke under pressure”, and under-perform right when it matters the most.
What are the neural mechanisms whereby motivation affects motor performance? Here we propose a targeted
set of experiments to dissect the neural mechanisms of motivated movement. Our work is guided by a conceptual
model that is premised on decades of research into the function of the dopamine system. Put simply, we posit
that dopamine modulates the activity of populations of neurons in the primary motor cortex. The level of
dopamine is determined by the size of the expected reward. Neurons in motor cortex are activated by dopamine,
as well as by volitional motor commands. We hypothesize that dopamine interacts with the ongoing neural control
of behavior: Moderate amounts of dopamine improve the fidelity of movement-related signals in the motor cortex,
but unusually high levels of dopamine actually interfere with neural activity patterns in motor cortex, perhaps by
making them too variable or poorly-formed to trigger a successful movement. If we can show that this picture (or
something like it) is true, then we can, for the first time, establish a direct link between motivation and motor
control, mediated by whole-brain circuits involved in the performance of a skilled movement.
Our approach relies on our recently established animal model: Rhesus monkeys exhibit the same behavioral
performance profile that humans do. That is, they show improved performance as motivation increases, but then
when the stakes get unusually high, they also choke under pressure. To our knowledge, this effect has never
been demonstrated in a nonhuman animal, which makes monkeys the ideal model system in which we can begin
to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms whereby motivation and movement mix in the human brain.
Here, using this unique model, we first study how reward modulates the motor cortical control of movement, and
test several hypotheses regarding how reward might mediate neural noise and behavioral variability. Second,
we test how these reward-related modulations influence the planning, initiation, and execution of reach. Third,
we record from midbrain dopaminergic reward processing circuits, to establish moment-by-moment links
between dopamine activity and ongoing motor performance, and probe causal effects of cortical dopamine.
Our studies stand to unveil the neural mechanisms of reward-based changes in motor control, with several
clinical implications: (1) In Parkinson’s disease, the death of dopaminergic neurons results both in a loss of
movement vigor and also a degradation in the quality of movement. This study will be among the first that will
show a direct link between dopamine activity and both motivation and motor performance. (2) In stroke,
rehabilitation can be a tedious and frustrating experience. Our work can show how the right motivational structure
can improve motor performance and perhaps learning. (3) Our work also has relevance for brain-computer
interfaces (BCI), through the design of systems that can extract stable motor-control signals despite shifts in
motivation."

 Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is caused by insulin resistance and reduced insulin secretion. Cellular
repressor of E1A-stimulated genes 1 (CREG1), a small glycoprotein involved in membrane trafficking in the
endocytic and secretory pathways, may be involved in the pathogenesis of T2DM, as suggested by the insulin
resistance, glucose intolerance, elevated glycemia and hypoinsulinemia in whole-body Creg1 knockout mice.
Gain- and loss-of-function studies using cultured hepatocytes and liver-specific Creg1 knockout mice
demonstrate that CREG1 autonomously regulates cellular insulin signaling, insulin sensitivity, and the expression
of insulin receptor on the plasma membrane. In pancreatic ?-cell-specific Creg1 knockout islets, increased
proinsulin and diminished insulin levels lead to impaired insulin secretion. Furthermore, CREG1 expression is
nutritionally regulated and is progressively downregulated by high-fat diet consumption. This project will test (1)
whether loss of CREG1 inhibits insulin receptor recycling and consequently impairs insulin signaling and insulin
action, (2) to what degree CREG1 downregulation contributes to insulin resistance in metabolic disease, and (3)
whether Creg1 ablation impedes insulin granule trafficking and enhances insulin degradation. In the first Aim,
we will delineate the role of CREG1 in the regulation of insulin receptor trafficking and its contribution to hepatic
insulin action and cellular insulin signaling. We will restore CREG1 expression in high fat diet fed mice via adeno-
associated virus-mediated CREG1 gene delivery and test if this improves insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling.
In the second Aim, we will elucidate how loss of CREG1 leads to reduced ?-cell insulin content with a focus on
proinsulin processing and insulin degradation. Pulse-chase labeling and live cell imaging, electron microscopy,
and biochemical analysis combined with complex physiological study protocols will be used in the proposed
studies. Our long-term goals are to elucidate how CREG1 regulates hepatic insulin action and ?-cell insulin
secretion, and to target CREG1 to treat T2DM."

Obesity is a global epidemic and a major contributor to some of the leading causes of death in the U.S., including
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Obesity plays a pleiotropic role in various metabolic
processes, including whole-body energy metabolism. Maintenance of whole-body homeostasis involves the
coordination of metabolic processes in multiple tissues, including adipose tissue and bone. Given its prominent
role in multiple bodily processes, recent evidence points to bone as a significant player in whole-body energy
metabolism. Myeloid-derived cells, specifically macrophages, that have been identified as a source of
extramedullary adipose tissue, arise from hematopoietic stem cells originating from the bone marrow. Osteocytes
comprise >90% of bone cells, are mechanosensors, and orchestrators of the bone remodeling process.
Osteocytic connexin 43 (Ocy Cx43) is a transmembrane protein expressed in bone that forms hemichannels
(HCs) that facilitate the communication of cells among themselves and with their environment. The postulation
that Ocy Cx43 may have a key role in the modulation of adipose tissue, and consequently metabolism and
disease progression, has never been investigated. By using transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative Cx43
mutants in osteocytes or monoclonal antibodies that open/close Cx43 HCs, our laboratory has shown that Ocy
Cx43 HCs are responsible for changes in adipose formation, in correlation with modulation in myeloid cell
populations. Thus, altering Ocy Cx43 activity could be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic
diseases, including obesity. This research effort aims to understand how Ocy Cx43 HCs can improve metabolic
health by reducing fat through myeloid cell regulation and evaluate this as a unique target for combatting obesity.
This information will identify new therapeutic targets for obesity and metabolic diseases. A better understanding
of the underlying mechanism connecting these tissues/cells will give us the ability to manipulate these
environments to improve systemic energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis, and to combat fat formation."

Stressful life events are one of the strongest predictors of depressive symptom onset, and individuals exposed
to early life stress (ELS) are 2 to 4 times more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder
(MDD). Anhedonia, or deficits in motivation, effort, and pleasure, is a core feature of MDD, and ELS has been
implicated as a significant contributor in the pathophysiology and manifestation of anhedonia, which may
explain higher rates of MDD in ELS. It is postulated that ELS increases anhedonia risk by potentiating cross-
talk between the innate immune system and neural circuits implicated in threat- and reward-related processing.
In support of this framework, there is evidence linking inflammation to increased vigilance for threats and
dampened reward sensitivity. Experimentally-induced inflammation alters activation of threat- and reward-
related brain regions, namely the amygdala and ventral striatum (VS). Further, higher levels of peripheral
inflammation have been associated with reduced functional connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala, as well as the vmPFC and VS, which in turn is associated with decreased
motivation and anhedonia, particularly in ELS-exposed individuals. Additionally, associations between
inflammation and anhedonia have been observed in PET studies of patients with MDD using radioligands to
target the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), whose expression is increased in classically-activated
microglia. However, prior research on ELS and anhedonia in humans lacks direct measures of
neuroinflammation, and studies have rarely focused on integrating measures of reward- and threat-related
neural connectivity. Thus, the goal of the proposed project is to advance a stress-induced model of anhedonia
that is driven by threat- and reward-related neuroinflammatory mediators. We propose to collect simultaneous
PET-fMRI from unmedicated MDD patients with clinically significant anhedonia and matched healthy controls
using the radioligand [18F]PBR111 to assess TSPO expression, an index of neuroinflammation. In Aim 1, we
will test the impact of early life stress on neuroinflammation (TSPO binding) in threat- and reward-related brain
regions. Across both groups, we hypothesize that greater exposure to ELS will predict increased TSPO binding
in brain regions implicated in reward and threat processing. In Aim 2, we will test the impact of ELS on threat-
and reward-network task-based functional connectivity. Across both groups, we hypothesize that greater
exposure to ELS will predict decreased threat-network functional connectivity (e.g., amygdala-vmPFC) and
decreased reward-network functional connectivity (e.g., VS-vmPFC). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the impact of
ELS on anhedonia severity via neuroinflammation and altered functional connectivity in MDD. In the MDD
group, significant pathways will be explored using mediation analyses. Findings will yield preliminary evidence
of ELS-related neuroinflammation, test putative immune mechanisms underlying the association between ELS
and anhedonia, and advance our understanding of anhedonia as a transdiagnostic symptom."

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common motor neurodegenerative disease and, as one of the
fastest growing neurological disorders in prevalence, disability-adjusted life years, and deaths, an increasingly
significant public health issue. Its core motor symptoms are caused by the dysfunction and death of dopamine
(DA) neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These neurons are particularly vulnerable, and
understanding the molecular underpinnings of this enhanced vulnerability may be critical for developing disease-
modifying treatments. Due to the irreversible nature of neurodegeneration, neuroprotective therapies are likely
to be most effective when targeting early, more reversible forms of neuronal dysfunction. In PD, one such early
pathological feature is the degeneration of SNpc DA neuron axons, which are lost earlier than the cell bodies
and whose degeneration more closely correlates with the decline of efficacy of dopamine replacement therapy
(the primary symptomatic treatment for PD). Because axon loss may be targeted prior to cell death, identifying
its mechanisms may be essential for developing neuroprotective therapies.
 Prior work indicates that axonal mitochondria are dynamically regulated and specialized to support axonal
function and survival. In this proposal, I seek to identify mechanisms by which axonal mitochondria are
specialized to promote the function and survival of SNpc DA neuron axons, and to identify how
alterations in these processes may contribute to PD pathophysiology. In Aim 1, I will develop a novel
molecular labeling and volumetric imaging platform for characterizing baseline features of mitochondria in the
axons of SNpc DA neurons, such as their density across different striatal subregions, and quantify their spatial
relationship to presynaptic structures. In Aim 2, I will implement an immunopurification strategy (Mitotag) for
separately isolating axonal and somatodendritic mitochondria from SNpc DA neurons, and carry out proteomics
and functional assays to identify the molecular and functional specialization of axonal mitochondria. In Aim 3, I
will then carry out similar experiments in a viral PD mouse model to identify how alterations to axonal
mitochondria may contribute to axonal degeneration. Using these findings as a guide, I will then carry out
overexpression or knockdown experiments to evaluate whether rescuing axonal mitochondrial defects could
alleviate axonal degeneration in PD.
 By delving into the fundamental biology of how mitochondria are specialized to sustain axonal survival
and probing how their functions are perturbed in disease, this proposal will help shed light into basic principles
of neuronal maintenance and function while potentially identifying early mechanisms of disease that can be
targeted before irreversible cell death."

 Drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) threatens to derail the progress made in global control of TB and
HIV. Of the nearly 500,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB worldwide annually, only half are cured
and those with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB have even poorer outcomes. New and repurposed drugs
for TB have revolutionized MDR/XDR TB treatment, resulting in improved cure rates and shorter, fully-oral
regimens. Bedaquiline (Bdq) and pretomanid (Pa) are medications from the first novel TB drug classes created
since 1968. Combined with a repurposed medication, linezolid (Lzd), these new drugs have provided
substantial improvements in survival and cure rates. The emergence of widespread Bdq, Pa or Lzd resistance
could undermine these drugs’ potential. The natural history of drug resistance is conceptualized as evolving
from sporadic drug-resistant mutants with low-level resistance soon after the drug is introduced, to a few highly
adapted transmissible strains that spread resistance across a population in a mature DR TB epidemic. As seen
in MDR/XDR TB, population-level drug resistance appears only after widespread transmission of drug-resistant
strains occurs, rather than through isolated instances of acquired resistance on TB treatment. In the proposed
study, we will examine the emergence of Bdq, Pa, and Lzd resistance in South Africa as treatment with these
new drugs is expanded to all drug-resistant TB cases. In Aim 1, we will prospectively characterize changes in
resistance-conferring mutations for Bdq, Pa and Lzd using whole genome sequencing (WGS) on isolates from
patients in three provinces. In Aim 2, we will examine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to assess for
meaningful shifts in the level of resistance to Bdq, Pa, and Lzd over the course of the study. In Aim 3, we will
use WGS, prior treatment exposure, and geospatial analysis to identify increased transmissibility and
geographic spread of Bdq, Pa, and Lzd resistance. The proposed study will provide essential information that
can inform the development of new rapid diagnostic assays for these critical new TB drugs. Further, our
phenotypic analyses will inform decisions on whether it is necessary to add drugs to existing treatment
regimens or increase the dose of a specific medication. Finally, our analyses of genetic clonality and
geographic spread will provide early warning signs to TB control programs about the potential for widespread
transmitted resistance. South Africa serves as a bellwether for the emergence and spread of DR TB. It is a
high-burden country that is leading the global scale up of new treatment regimens containing Bdq, Lzd, and
now Pa, for all drug-resistant patients. The proposed study is optimally timed to prospectively study the
emergence, evolution and dispersal of drug resistance to Bdq, Pa and Lzd as they are being scaled up for the
DR TB treatment worldwide."
10795646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposures to toxic metals and psychological and social stressors during sensitive periods of fetal and infant
development are associated with poorer child cognitive and socioemotional development. There is also evidence
for moderating effects between toxic metals and psychological and social stressors, such that the effects of toxic
metals on development may be conditional upon exposures to psychological and social stress and vice versa.
Because physical, psychological, and social risk factors tend to cluster, the study of combined exposures may
be more ecologically valid. Though prior studies have utilized two-way statistical interactions to examine these
combined effects, these models still fall short in recognizing that individuals are concurrently exposed to multiple
risk and protective factors across the physical and social environments. Previous studies have also failed to
rigorously test the extent to which caregiving experience may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of prenatal
exposure to toxic metals on child outcomes. Using longitudinal data from the Brain and Early Experiences Study
and a finite mixture modeling approach, this study will: 1) categorize prenatal exposures to toxic metals,
psychological and social risk factors, and protective factors into latent profiles of prenatal risk; 2) test associations
between latent profiles of prenatal risk and indices of child cognitive and socioemotional development at 36
months old; and 3) examine indices of caregiving experience as moderators for the effects of latent profiles of
prenatal risk on child cognitive and socioemotional development. Throughout these analyses, inferences
between the latent profile approach and more traditional statistical approaches (i.e., two-way interactions) will
be compared. This study will examine prenatal toxic metal and psychological and social risk holistically and has
the potential to identify strategies to offset the effects of prenatal toxic metals and psychological and social risk
on child development. The accompanying training plan will provide Ms. Wylie with the foundation to build her
program of research which will combine developmental and public health sciences to study the joint influences
of the physical and social environments on child development, and how positive social experience may be used
to mitigate the effects of physical and chemical stressors. Specifically, Ms. Wylie will a) build her substantive
expertise in early life environmental exposures relevant to child neurodevelopment and their mechanisms of
action; b) expand her quantitative skillset towards the application of finite mixture models and moderation
analyses; c) expand her expertise in the study of protective social environments in early life; and d) develop her
interdisciplinary collaborations and career development skills. Ms. Wylie has assembled a stellar and cohesive
mentorship team from the disciplines of developmental science, environmental science, and quantitative
psychology. This mentorship team carries the expertise, experience, and dedication to Ms. Wylie’s professional
development that will ensure the successful completion of her training goals and research plan."

 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurological illness due to a deficit of dopamine
neurotransmission with no known cure. Nevertheless, there are available drug treatments for
ameliorating symptoms. One class of drugs used in PD therapy are the Catechol-O-
Methyltransferase inhibitors (COMT-I’s). However, COMT-I’s are known to cause multiple
adverse events in PD patients, including a rare but fatal hepatotoxicity. Our lab has shown that
one COMT-I, entacapone, is widely nitroreduced by a multiple gut bacterial species. Additionally,
other studies have shown variable nitroreduction of entacapone and tolcapone by complex gut
bacterial communities in vitro. Previous studies have also shown that COMT-I’s are linked with
changes in gut commensal abundances, as well as entacapone acting as an anti-commensal
drug. This proposal presents a plan to understand how the gut microbiome modulates COMT-I
efficacy and toxicity through metabolic transformations which impact drug function and
microbiome disruption. I have identified active COMT-I nitroreductases in a common gut
commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, shown that nitroreduction of tolcapone leads to loss
of drug efficacy in vitro and ex vivo, and began to characterize a link between bacterial COMT-I
nitroreduction and anti-bacterial activity. In Aim 1, I will determine how bacterial metabolism
affects COMT-I PK/PD and host toxicity, as well as how nitroreductase presence in in vitro
complex human bacterial communities affects drug metabolism and metabolite production. In Aim
2, I will delve into the aspects which cause COMT-I’s to be toxic towards bacteria, how bacterial
nitroreduction plays a role in this toxicity, and how variable COMT-I metabolism affects complex
bacterial community structure. If successful, my research will uncover a previously hidden aspect
of how COMT-I efficacy, toxicity, and microbiome disruption can be influenced by a widespread
bacterial nitroreduction. This project will also provide me key research training opportunities
regarding studies using pharmacology, analytical chemistry, microbiology, and biochemistry.
Furthermore, I will be exposed to many professional training opportunities to improve my skills in
areas such as mentorship, teaching, scientific writing, and scientific presentation. With the support
of my thesis advisor, Dr. Andrew Goodman, pursuing this project and these training plans here at
Yale will allow me to grow as an independent researcher."

Desmoplakin is an elongated protein that links the desmosomal components to the cytoskeleton through
intermediate filaments. Heterozygous truncation mutations in the DSP gene, which encodes desmoplakin,
cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) impacting the left ventricle. A striking feature associated with
DSP truncation variants (DSPtv) is a prominent inflammatory component, and this inflammation can be well
visualized through cardiac imaging using magnetic resonance or positron emission tomography. The effect of
DSP truncations in mediating cardiac inflammation is not well understood. The nature of DSP truncations
implies that haploinsufficiency or reduction of desmoplakin protein is contributory feature of left ventricular
cardiomyopathy with inflammation. To begin to characterize the transcriptional program associated with DSP-
cardiomyopathy, I analyzed RNA-sequencing from neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes with siRNA to
reduce expression of DSP. Analysis of the differentially expressed genes in siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes
identified immune chemotactic pathways as having increased expression. Of particular note were several
genes connected to pyroptosis, an immunologically active form of cell death. Taken together, these data
suggest that innate immune pathways may contribute significantly to DSP-associated cardiomyopathy. I
hypothesize that reduction of desmoplakin promotes excessive inflammasome activation in cardiomyocytes
that results in aberrant calcium handling and pro-arrhythmogenic heterocellular junctions. In Aim 1 of this
proposal, I will assess this inflammatory component of DSP-cardiomyopathy in human-induced pluripotent
stem cell (hiPSC) lines with distinct DSP truncations derived from individuals with inflammatory-arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy. To characterize 2D- and 3D-hiPSC models, I will assess whether DSP haploinsufficiency is
sufficient to drive expression of inflammasome components. I will then examine DSPtvs for their effects on
contractility and calcium transients in response to pathogen- and damage-derived activators of the
inflammasome. I will conduct coculture assays of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts to evaluate
the inflammatory modulation of heterocellular junctions and cardiac conduction in DSP-cardiomyopathy. In
Aim 2 of the proposal, I will modulate innate immune activation in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocyte models using
siRNA, small molecule inhibition, and epigenetic modulation strategies. These studies will target Never in
Mitosis A-related Kinase 7 (NEK7), an inflammasome component with differential gene expression in heart
failure. The proposed studies will expand from observations in patients with DSPtvs and define the
inflammatory triggers refining the distinct pathology related to DSP-mediated disease. In particular, the
findings from this study have implications for other forms of cardiomyopathy driven by fibrotic transformation
such as dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure."

10737648,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Elucidating mechanisms that control chromosome topology is of much interest as ~10% of human diseases arise
from changes in genomic architecture. The Cohesin and CTCF proteins establish and revise chromosome loops
to direct promoter/enhancer contacts that mediate tissue- and developmental stage-specific gene transcription.
In a cell population, loops can form through uni- or bi-directional cohesin-mediated loop extrusion between CTCF
binding elements (CBEs) bound by CTCF. Yet, any potential role for the directionality of loop formation has not
been considered. Antigen receptor (AgR) loci are great models for studying functions of chromosome topology
because changes in their architectures during lymphocyte development help establish AgR repertoires vital for
immunity. The recombination of AgR locus variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments produces
AgR diversity. Thus, studying AgR loci also yields mechanistic insights into how chromosome topology controls
the initiation of V(D)J recombination and the cellular response to DNA damage that suppresses transformation
of all cells. AgR loci contain many V segments and CBEs spanning vast genomic distances located far upstream
of (D)J clusters flanked by CBEs of convergent orientation with V CBEs. When an AgR locus activates, the RAG
endonuclease binds (D)J segments to establish a recombination center (RC) and CTCF and Cohesin form loops
that reposition all V segments within similar spatial proximity to the RC. Early studies formulated a model wherein
Cohesin/CTCF-mediated loops between V and RC CBEs generate compacted locus structures that drive long-
distance V-to-RC recombination by increasing the chance for diffusion-based collisions between V segments
and the RC (structural synapsis). This mechanism would support recombination by deletion or inversion. More
recent next generation sequencing (NGS) studies of Igh and Tcra/d show that cohesin-directed loop extrusion
from the RC directs V-to-RC recombination by allowing RAG to unidirectionally scan the locus and capture a V
RSS (scanning synapsis). This mechanism dictates that recombination occurs only by deletion and uses V CBEs
to impede loop extrusion. While scanning synapsis might mediate V-to-RC rearrangements by deletion at all loci,
it cannot direct long-range V-to-RC rearrangements that occur through inversion in Tcrb and Igk loci. Based on
differences between published Igh studies and unpublished Tcrb data of the applicant, he hypothesizes that the
direction of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion across a locus determines whether scanning or structural synapsis
mediates long-range rearrangement. To test this hypothesis, the applicant proposes to: Aim 1) determine the
extents that scanning and structural synapsis operate within Tcrb and Aim 2) elucidate the impacts of Vb CBE
modifications on long-range synapsis by each mechanism. The expected outcomes would yield a major advance
by providing strong evidence that the direction of chromosome loop extrusion dictates the underlying mechanism
of long-range V-to-RC recombination. This would serve as a foundation for experiments to determine the function
of loop extrusion direction in regulating gene expression and repair, replication, and segregation of genomes."

 Opioid use disorder is becoming more pervasive as the opioid epidemic continues. Opioids are heavily
prescribed and are highly effective for treating acute pain, but not chronic pain, resulting in a large risk factor
for abuse. The ability to predict specific individual susceptibility to opioid use disorder is limited, partially due to
the complex comorbidity with other mental and physical illnesses. This requires a more extensive
characterization that emphasizes innate individual differences in emotionality, pain sensitivity, and motivated
behaviors. Recent work from the Barker lab has characterized these differences by using a stress model in
rodents to give rise to these individual differences. These differences have been characterized through a
behavioral battery targeting negative valence, pain, and opioid preference. Mice have different susceptibility
profiles based on previous stressful experiences and mu-opioid receptors (MOR) within the lateral habenula
(LHb) are candidates for this maladaptive plasticity. The proposed aims target these potential molecular
pathways by using transcriptomics and testing the necessity of key anatomical structures using chemogenetic
manipulation. Aim 1 will assess how MOR expression within the LHb changes in response to stress and
across sexes. Beginning with behavioral testing, behavior profiles will be assessed, and MOR expression will
be quantified using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Dimension reduction analysis will be applied to these
data sets to consolidate these parameters into opioid susceptibility profiles. Aim 2, will assess the necessity of
the LHb in stress-mediated changes in opioid susceptibility. The LHb will be chemogenetically modulated via
inhibitory DREADDs during foot shock and then characterization of opioid susceptibility will be performed
through behavioral testing. The completion of these aims will establish potential molecular and anatomical
targets for novel therapeutics as well as aid in the characterization of a translatable model of individualized
opioid susceptibility.
 The proposed fellowship will provide the PI/trainee with a strong foundation for a career as an
independent neuroscientist while providing a training environment in line with the goals of diversity in the NIH.
The training incorporates ample professional development opportunities and strong faculty-student
mentorships and collaborations. This will provide strong technical training in the domains of experimental
design, behavior, molecular techniques, neuroanatomy, and statistics. Overall, this fellowship has significant
potential to elucidate translatable phenotypes imperative to the treatment and prevention of opioid use disorder
and provide the necessary training to become a valuable member of the addiction neuroscience community."
10824353,"Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play key roles in regulating normal cellular processes and are linked to many
human diseases. Each RTK protomer contains an extracellular region that binds activating ligands, a single
transmembrane helix, and an intracellular region that contains the kinase domain necessary for intracellular
signaling. For many RTKs, their cognate ligands form stable homodimers, and the binding of dimeric ligand to
the extracellular region of RTK drives receptor dimerization, which then brings two intracellular kinases in close
proximity, enabling their autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated kinases can further recruit effector proteins,
and thereby triggering downstream signaling cascade. This “ligand-induced-dimerization” is the long-standing
model for the activation of RTKs, and has been well characterized by extensive structural and functional
studies. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that several members in RTK family use unique activation
mechanisms. For instance, the MuSK receptor alone cannot directly bind to and be activated by its ligand
Agrin, but requiring assistance of the co-receptor Lrp4 on the muscle cell surface for activation. In addition, the
activation of TAM receptor requires not only the binding of its ligands, but also the involvement of
phosphatidylserine lipid (PtdSer) from plasma membrane. Furthermore, our preliminary structure results
showed that, different to all other RTKs, one HGF molecular can simultaneously engages two c-MET receptors
by utilizing two distinct interfaces; therefore, a single HGF is sufficient for the activation of c-MET receptor,
which represents another paradigm in activation mechanisms of RTK. The goal of this project is to study the
structures and functions of several special RTKs, including MuSK, TAM and c-MET receptors, whose
activation mechanism are still poorly understood. Solving the high-resolution structures of different unique
members of RTK family in the ligand-bound active state will explain the specific features that differentiate these
receptors from other RTKs, and reveal the common mechanism and diversification in the activation of RTK.
Aim 1 will be focused on the functional and structural analyses of MuSK receptor complex. This study will
reveal the detailed binding mode between MuSK, Lrp4 and Agrin, and explain why co-receptor Lrp4 is critical
for the activation of MuSK. Aim 2 will be focused on biochemical and structural analyses of TAM receptor in the
membrane associated functional state. The result from this study will allow us to explain the functional
importance of PtdSer in TAM activation. Aim 3 will be focused on the structural determination of c-MET
receptor in the HGF bound active state to understand why single HGF molecular is sufficient for c-MET
activation."

The cardiac action potential is primarily generated by sodium and calcium channels, which depolarize the
membrane potential, and by potassium channels that repolarize the membrane potential and terminate the
action potential. One of the major cardiac potassium currents is the slowly activating potassium current IKs that
contribute to the action potential termination. Over 300 different inherited mutations have been found in IKs
channels that cause cardiac arrhythmias in patients. IKs channels regulate the length of the cardiac contraction
and mutations that decreases the activity of IKs channels result in a prolongation of the cardiac contraction,
leading to Long QT Syndrome. In turn, Long QT syndrome is a risk factor for ventricular fibrillation and sudden
cardiac death. We have identified a family of compounds that activate IKs channels and are antiarrhythmic
when applied to cardiomyocytes. We will here test whether these compounds restores the length of the action
potential in human cardiomyocytes from Long QT Syndrome patients. We will also test the effect of these
compounds on in ex vivo animal hearts and in vivo in transgenic animals with Long QT Syndrome mutations, in
order to develop drug that restores the QT interval and that can be tested in future clinical trial. We will also
test variants of these compounds on heterologously expressed IKs channels using two-electrode voltage clamp,
to determine the important structure of these compounds for their effects on IKs channels. We will also make
mutations of IKs channels to determine the binding site of these compounds. Finally, we will test the efficacy of
these compounds to reverse different defects in IKs channels caused by different types of Long QT syndrome
mutations. This will be tested both in heterologous systems and in human cardiomyocytes. The anticipated
results of these experiments will provide proof-of-concept that this family of compounds can shorten the
cardiac action potential and prevent cardiac arrhythmia, and will provide preliminary animal model data to start
clinical trials of these compounds. We anticipate that this development of new anti-arrhythmic drugs will lead to
better treatments of cardiac arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac deaths in LQTS patients."
10833020,"Summary:
To sustain neural signaling and enable plasticity throughout life, the nervous system relies on homeostatic
interactions with a diverse population of glial cells, which create and modify the extracellular matrix, remove
ions and neurotransmitters, provide metabolic support and promote functional reorganization of circuits in
response to changing patterns of activity. Although most studies of glial cells have focused on the three main
classes of glia – astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia – the mammalian brain also contains an abundant,
highly dynamic population of glial progenitors termed oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs or NG2 glia).
These lineage restricted progenitors play crucial roles in generating oligodendrocytes to enable production of
new myelin sheaths during motor learning and replacement of myelin destroyed through disease, such as
multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). OPCs remain widely distributed in gray and
white matter throughout life, but exhibit profound changes in behavior with aging, including reduced
proliferation and differentiation. Emerging evidence suggests that OPCs do more than serve as progenitors for
oligodendrocytes, as they are found in regions where there is no myelin, and like microglia, OPCs migrate to
sites of injury and contribute to scar formation, features unrelated to their role in oligodendrogenesis and
myelin repair. OPCs share many other features with microglia – they are present at a similar density, maintain
a grid-like distribution, possess ramified, radially-oriented processes and are highly dynamic, continuously
exploring their surrounding environment with motile filopodia. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that OPCs
can transform into inflammatory OPCs (iOPCs) that engulf and present exogenous antigens through MHC
class I and II when exposed to inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that they may modulate tissue inflammation.
While microglia and astrocytes are known to undergo phenotypic changes in response to inflammation that
profoundly influence the aging brain, much less is known about the role of OPCs in this context, despite their
persistence in brain circuits. In part, this lack of knowledge stems from the limited molecular and physiological
interrogation of OPCs that has been completed in vivo. OPCs are underrepresented in available single cell
RNA-seq datasets and there have been no studies specifically designed to define how changes in their
properties with aging are influenced by their prior behavior. We will leverage a diverse array of methodologies
and our combined expertise in physiology, molecular and computational biology to define the causes and
consequences of age-dependent changes in these ubiquitous glial cells. The new insight provided by these
studies may lead to a deeper understanding of the homeostatic roles performed by these glial cells, and reveal
new approaches for rejuvenating their regenerative potential to sustain brain function throughout life."

assessments and dementia care models. We will recruit 400 participants from the UCSF Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center (ADRC), which includes large, heterogeneous, deeply phenotyped clinical cohorts (ranging
from cognitively unimpaired to dementia) with a large Latino/Hispanic component; and 750 participants from
the New IDEAS study, which is evaluating the clinical utility of amyloid PET in Medicare beneficiaries with MCI
or dementia and emphasizes recruitment of Black/African American and Latino/Hispanic patients. With
Collaborator Dr. Peggye Dilworth-Anderson, novel enrollment approaches that attend to cultural nuances,

neurodegeneration will be measured in 1,000 participants with co-investigator Dr. Sid O’Bryant. We will identify
vulnerability factors and care needs that will inform future diagnostic care models. All participants will undergo
amyloid PET, and UCSF ADRC participants will additionally undergo tau PET and MRI. We will identify the
clinical measures and blood-based biomarkers that best predict molecular pathology. We will develop
classifiers that consider patient factors, SDH, cognition, caregiver factors, and blood-based biomarkers to
predict amyloid and tau PET findings, necessity for PET imaging and health outcomes. We will mentor and
support junior and early stage-investigators throughout the project. This project will address ADRD Research
Implementation Milestone 9.L “Improving differential diagnosis of symptomatic cognitive impairment,” while
also advancing additional key Milestones related to racial/ethnic diversity and blood-based biomarkers. This
work will ready the field for inclusive identification of appropriate candidates for disease modifying therapies."

In the three major intracellular trafficking pathways–exocytosis, endocytosis and autophagy–proteins and
membranes are secreted, internalized or shuttled for degradation, respectively. These pathways are regulated
by the conserved Ypt/Rab GTPases that when activated by nucleotide exchangers (GEFs), recruit their
effectors to membranes. These effectors are machinery components that mediate vesicular transport steps,
from vesicle formation, through motility and targeting, to fusion. I have worked in the Ypt/Rab field since its
inception and contributed to the formulation of principles that underlie their mode of action. These include ideas
that they function in “GTPase modules”, which contain GEF/s, a GTPase, and effector/s, to organize pathway-
or step-specific membrane microdomains. While mechanisms underlying Ypt/Rab function are currently known,
questions regarding pathway and step coordination remain open. We propose that Ypt/Rab GTPases
coordinate intracellular trafficking at three levels: Coordination of multiple pathways, integration of transport
steps into whole pathways, and coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps of individual transport steps.
The proposed research relies on our recent findings using yeast as a model system, and we will continue using
yeast due to its smaller proteome that results in a much smaller interactome, which is important for exploring
the following coordination issues: Multiple pathways coordination: I propose that Ypt/Rabs coordinate
autophagy with secretion and endocytosis at two intersections. In the first, Ypt1/Rab1 is required for the
beginning of secretion and autophagy in the context of two different GTPase modules. In the second
intersection, merging of endocytosis and late autophagy is regulated by a shared Vps21/Rab5 GTPase
module. Here, we will determine whether cells prioritize certain pathways under different environmental
conditions and how such a priority is promoted. Integration of transport steps: Here, we will address two major
questions: First, how do Ypts regulate the beginning of a pathway, especially when a single GTPase functions
in the context of two different modules? Second, what are the specific mechanisms by which Ypts coordinate
early and late steps in secretion and autophagy? Coordination of vesicular transport sub-steps: We will explore
late steps of the secretory and autophagy pathways, for which members of the GTPase modules are known,
and ask how effectors that function sequentially are recruited. We will use classical and molecular genetics
combined with cell biology and biochemistry approaches to address these questions.
An efficient and well-coordinated network of cellular trafficking pathways is important for all the systems of the
human body, and even a minor defect can result in a severe disease. Ypt/Rabs in general were implicated in a
spectrum of acquired and inherited diseases, and those we study were associated with cancer and
neurodegeneration. Finally, we recently showed the value of yeast modeling in understanding how a
conserved protein variant causes a neurodevelopmental disorder."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a chronic multifactorial disease primarily affecting the macula region
of the retina, is a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly. AMD is a disease of the photoreceptor support
system linked with local inflammatory events and complement activation-promotion genes. Apart from a small
number of studies in advanced AMD, the significance of systemically assessed inflammation in AMD has not
been adequately addressed. This is especially true for patients with intermediate AMD (iAMD), an early form of
AMD, where we suggest that the presence of systemic inflammation may be a risk factor for iAMD progression
to the visually threatening forms of advanced AMD. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted pilot studies
to evaluate profiles of circulating inflammatory markers including complement, cytokines, chemokines, and
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in patients with iAMD recruited into our Colorado AMD registry. We
found compelling evidence that certain inflammatory biomarkers distinguished patients with and without iAMD,
and most importantly patients with iAMD who progressed to advanced AMD. Furthermore, we found in iAMD
patients a significant link between systemic levels of hsCRP, and choroidal thinning on optical coherence
tomography (OCT), a finding which is one of the pathological events linked with AMD. In aggregate, these
findings suggest that studying iAMD as we propose, can provide insights into early pathologic events in AMD
and also allow one to identify those at highest risk for severe AMD and progressive visual loss. The purpose of
the proposed study is to corroborate and expand on the findings from our novel pilot data in an adequately
powered iAMD cohort and explore our hypothesis that among patients with iAMD an inflammatory biomarker
profile will identify patients who will convert to advanced AMD. We will leverage our cohort's existing
longitudinal blood samples linked to demographic and epidemiology data as well as DNA, multimodal image,
and outcome data. We will address this hypothesis with two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will follow an iAMD
cohort over time and, a) Identify the profile of inflammatory biomarkers that best distinguishes patients with
iAMD who progress to advanced AMD, and b) Develop a dynamic risk score for AMD progression that
combines AMD epidemiological, newly defined inflammatory profiles, and genetic risk factors. In Aim 2, we will
focus on OCT imaging biomarkers previously established as risk factors for AMD progression. We will
determine the relationships between circulating inflammatory biomarkers and both qualitative (e.g., reticular
pseudodrusen) and quantitative (e.g., drusen volume and choroidal thickness) measures. We expect our study
will show an important role for systemic inflammation in iAMD. This study will present an opportunity to better
understand iAMD pathogenesis as well as for early identification of a high-risk group of individuals in which
targeted interventions can be developed to interrupt the natural history of AMD by preventing iAMD
progression to advanced AMD and vision loss."

Behavioral inhibition includes our ability to inhibit prepotent, reflexive or perseverative behaviors in the pursuit
of longer-term goals. Impairments in behavioral inhibition are associated with greater levels of impulsivity.
Impulsivity can be classified into at three major categories. Motor impulsivity is measured using tasks focused
on waiting – impulsive subjects cannot wait as long prior to responding. Impulsivity can also be related to
choice – for example, choosing a smaller immediate reward instead of a larger delayed reward. Finally,
impulsive subjects tend to perseverate (i.e. act without thinking), and thus cannot flexibly shift behaviors as
needed when the environment changes. Impulsivity is pan-diagnostic, occurring in attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), drug & alcohol addiction, affective disorders and even neurologic disorders like
frontotemporal dementia.
Various behavioral tasks have been designed to measure the above features of impulsivity. Such models have
been used to test the effects of drugs on minimizing impulsivity. Drugs used in these tasks can modulate
behavior, but not always in a predictable or even replicable manner across labs, strains or species. This has
precluded simple attempts at testing how pharmacologic agents can improve impulsivity. This grant, following
RFA specifications, is focused on assessing whether electrophysiological measures of impulsivity can provide
a more stable “intermediary” measure of circuit activity relevant to impulsivity that can be used for preclinical
pharmacologic testing and development.
The goals of this grant are first to identify neurophysiological (LFP-based) markers of subdomains of
impulsivity described above, with a particular focus on identifying physiological markers that are translationally
relevant and potentially measurable non-invasively in humans. Next, we will assess whether these physiologic
measures can be used as an assay for therapeutic development by testing how the identified physiological
marker changes in response to varying dosages of drugs known to affect specific subdomains of impulsivity.
Finally, using optogenetics targeted at serotonin or dopamine, we will be able to directly test whether
modulation of these neurotransmitter systems in a temporally refined way affects physiology and behavior."

Light is an important regulator in circadian biology, behavior, and gene expression. Light-
triggered visual functions are orchestrated through multiple channels and conveyed by specific
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the
morphologies and functions of the 40+ RGC types, the cellular and molecular basis underlying the
formation and survival of the diverse RGC types remains poorly understood. This grant proposal
focuses on the roles of T-box transcription factors Tbr1 and Tbr2 in regulating specific types of
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We have previously found that Tbr1 expression marks two distinct
subsets of OFF RGCs, and that Tbr1 plays a critical role in regulating the dendritic morphogenesis
in these RGCs. We have shown that Tbr2 is essential for the formation and maintaining the
survival of ipRGCs. Most recently, we further discovered that Tbr2-expressing neurons are
comprised of two populations. The goals of this project are to understand the genetic regulatory
networks mediated by Tbr1 and Tbr2 in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of how
these distinct RGCs are formed during development. We will accomplish this goal by determining
the role and function of Tbr1 and its transcriptional network in regulating development and
dendritic morphogenesis in developing RGCs. We will analyze the retinofugal projections of
ipRGC subtype, investigate the role of Tbr2 downstream regulator Irx1 in the development of
ipRGC subtype, elucidate the identity of Tbr2+ displaced amacrine cells and the role of Tbr2 in
these dACs, and establish Tbr2-mediated RGC-to-RGC/dAC networks during development.
The objective of this application is to understand the design principle underlying RGC subtype
formation and the structure and function of retinal circuits. Completion of the proposed project
will build deeper understanding regarding how two closely related transcription factors function
so differently in regulating the development of distinct RGC subtypes."

In the US, women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) are less likely to be adherent to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
and virally suppressed compared to men living with HIV/AIDS. Concurrently, WLHA experience high rates of
interpersonal violence – physical, sexual, and/or psychological abuse in adulthood – which often results in
trauma (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and other adverse mental health, further contributing to
ART non-adherence. Additionally, the confluence of syndemic adverse mental health, substance use, and
socio-structural factors (e.g., HIV stigma, medical mistrust) further contribute to poor HIV outcomes. Social
support through peer navigation and networks has been shown to counter these effects and improve HIV
outcomes among WLHA. Likewise, psychoeducation addressing affective distress to improve mood and
emotion management and relationship skills has been shown to reduce PTSD and depression. However,
limited resources at HIV service agencies combined with socio-structural barriers (e.g., lack of transportation,
competing priorities) impede the potential effectiveness of in-person peer navigation. A scalable and
sustainable solution is the use of technology in the form of web-based video interaction. To that end, we
developed and pilot tested a 4-month web-based, trauma-informed peer navigation-psychoeducation social
support intervention among WLHA affected by interpersonal violence and syndemic adverse mental health
and/or substance use. We demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, preliminary improvements in ART adherence,
PTSD symptoms, coping self-efficacy, and social support. Building on these promising pilot findings, we
propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of Women SHINE to improve ART adherence among WLHA
affected by adulthood interpersonal violence in California. Participants will be randomized to either: a) the
intervention arm (n=180) where women will receive a 4-month program comprised of video-based peer
navigation support via one-on-one sessions and 7 psychoeducation weekly support group sessions, and
access to a static Women SHINE website with statewide resources for HIV care, interpersonal violence,
trauma, mental health, and substance use; or b) the control arm (n=180) where women will receive a single
group session on self-care and well-being, with access to the static Women SHINE website. Women will
complete video-based survey assessments and mailed hair sample self-collection at baseline, 4-, 8-, and 12-
months post-randomization. Compared to the control arm, we will determine if Women SHINE is associated
with improvements in ART adherence (Aim 1) and PTSD symptoms and emotion regulation (Aim 2). We will
also examine individual (e.g., self-efficacy for coping, social support networks) and socio-structural (e.g., HIV
stigma, medical mistrust) mechanisms of change in the efficacy of Women SHINE (Aim 3). If efficacious, we
will conduct subsequent research to determine effective and feasible methods for intervention implementation
nationwide to improve HIV outcomes among WLHA."
10830252,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune synovitis that affects 0.5% of the world population. RA is
characterized by intermittent flares of clinical arthritis that is thought to be mediated in part by anti-
citrullinated protein autoimmune responses. The best established environmental risk factors for developing
RA include cigarette smoking and periodontal disease, suggesting oral mucosa is a critical site for disease
initiation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these environmental exposures lead to RA development
and progression remain poorly understood. We have established a clinical and technical protocol for
repeated home finger stick blood collection in RA patients to allow for longitudinal RNA sequencing
(RNAseq). Using this novel approach, we recently discovered bacteria characteristic of human oral mucosa
in the blood of anti-CCP+ RA patients, followed by activation of a signature B cell immune response 3 weeks
later, and then clinical flare of disease activity 2 weeks after that. We also investigated B cell responses to
these pathogens. We demonstrated elevations in IgA blood plasmablasts both in pre-clinical RA as well as
in established RA, with the continual re-activation of a distinct set of IgA/IgG plasmablast clonal families in
established RA suggesting a persistent mucosally-driven germinal center reaction. We demonstrate that the
recombinant Mabs encoded by the persistently reactivated IgA/G plamablast clonal families encode
antibodies that react with both human citrullinated antigens and citrullinated isoforms of oral bacteria
identified in the blood of patients antecedent to flares. We anticipate that RA plasmablast Mabs with distinct
specificities, either alone or in immune complexes, mediate activation of distinct cellular responses that
promote synovitis and tissue destruction in RA. This R01 proposal will test the hypothesis that mucosal
breaks trigger plasmablast responses that encode anti-bacterial antibodies that cross-react with host
citrullinated antigens. We further hypothesize that mucosal bacteria-induced ACPA activate cellular
responses, including macrophage TNF production, NETosis and osteoclast activation, which promote
synovitis and joint tissue destruction in RA. Aim 1 will identify the antibody repertoires responsive to pre-flare
bacteremia in two independent cohorts of RA patients. Aim 2 will characterize RA plasmablast IgA/G Mabs
and sera for reactivity to citrullinated isoforms of bacterial species derived from subgingival collections. Aim 3
will characterize periodontitis tissue for evidence of RA-related autoimmunity. Aim 4 will determine the
mechanisms by which cross reactive Mabs, either alone or in immune complexes, mediate arthritis. Success
of this proposal would demonstrate that citrullinated periodontal bacteria and mucosal breaks play a key role
in mediating RA flare, findings that could lead to development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

 The highest cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making, are all, directly or
indirectly, influenced by our past personal experiences, which are represented in hippocampal-cortical circuits
as episodic memories. Dysfunction of these circuits has been linked to the most prevalent and challenging
mental disorders of our time, ranging from dementia to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval are therefore
essential for the development of effective molecular and circuit-based therapies for such disorders. The current
project focuses on systems consolidation, a process which, through sustained interactions between
hippocampal and cortical circuits, leads to a lasting cortical representation of episodic memories. Based on
existing evidence, including our own published and pilot data, we posit a key role of activity-dependent
inflammatory signaling in discrete dorsohippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) in
systems consolidation, including tagging, activation, and deactivation of the DH-RSC circuit. Aim 1 is designed
to determine the contributions of discrete DH-RSC projections to early tagging of RSC and sustained
inflammatory signaling in DH and RSC. Aim 2 will focus on the direct contribution of hippocampal Toll-like
receptors (Tlr) to memory consolidation and induction of TGFb1, and Aim 3 will examine the contribution of
TGFb to the cortical dependence of memories and deactivation of inflammatory signaling in the DH-RSC
circuit. These aims will be tested in mouse models of episodic-like memories by applying projection-specific
manipulations of the DH-RSC circuit, cell-specific genetic manipulations of Tlr9 and TGFb receptors, and by
monitoring circuit activity through virally expressed signaling reporters in vivo. We also plan to apply
quantitative molecular biologic and biochemical approaches that will enable us to determine the concentration-
dependent TGFb effects on gene expression patterns associated with activation and deactivation of the DH-
RSC circuit. We believe that advancing our understanding of neuronal inflammation in the organization of
memory circuits will advance our fundamental knowledge of systems consolidation. At the same time, we hope
that circuit-specific Tlr9/TGFb signaling will emerge as candidate target for therapies for neuropsychiatric
disorders rooted in episodic memory deficits."

 As advances in both experimental and computational biology lead to exciting discoveries in many ﬁelds
of biology and biomedicine today, new avenues to diagnose and treat human disease are becoming a reality.
Molecular dynamics and other simulation approaches play a key role in these connections by helping deﬁne
the underlying biophysical mechanisms, at unprecedented resolution. The PI's computational biophysics lab
focuses on solving fundamental structural and functional challenges concerning nucleic acids and their complexes
(notably chromatin and RNA), in collaboration with experimentalists, by innovative molecular models and
simulation methods using ideas from mathematics, computer science, engineering, biology, and chemistry. This
MIRA project would continue to advance our fundamental understanding of genome organization and RNA motifs
using multiscale models that bridge disparate spatial and temporal scales to generate biophysical insights into
genome folding and cancer genomics, and RNA conformational landscapes/ viral mechanisms. For chromatin and
chromosomes, modeled nucleosomes and their protein complexes at atomic resolution, and chromatin ﬁbers at the
mesoscale, will be linked to data from genome-wide and cancer epigenomics studies to determine the modulation
of chromatin higher-order structure in processes of aberrant gene expression. Speciﬁcally, we will focus on the
structural role and mechanisms of proteins (like CTCF and H1) in gene looping and formation of topologically
associated domains (TADs) and nuclear compartments in gene activation or repression in cancer cells. For RNA,
our topological approach to modeling RNA secondary structure by coarse-grained graphs (RAG: RNA-As-Graphs),
combined with atomic biophysical modeling, will delineate programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanisms in
RNA coronaviruses and other viruses, and advance the RNA motif atlas. Speciﬁcally, conformational dynamics
associated with the RNA frameshifting element of SARS-CoV-2, along with evolutionary and biophysical analysis
and chemical reactivity experiments, will describe frameshifting transitions and identify/test experimentally
structure-altering mutations that may hamper frameshifting. RAG will also be applied to deﬁne a virus topology
atlas and explore virus motifs from an RNA repertoire point of view, to help understand the RNA motif universe
and advance novel RNA design. The unraveled biophysical mechanisms in genome organization and RNA
frameshifting/conformational repertoire have translational ramiﬁcations for human cancers and viral infections
by coronaviruses or HIV. For cancer therapy, a targeted re-expression of silenced genes may be possible by
chromatin topological changes (e.g., loop dissolution) and RNA editing. For viral RNA infections, new strategies
for gene and anti-viral therapy emerge from this research, feasible by modern RNA editing technologies. The
resulting multidisciplinary computational paradigms are widely applicable to other biomolecular processes and
will be shared with the community at large."

Noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis and the leading cause of severe childhood
diarrhea globally. Our discovery of murine norovirus (MNV) in 2003 accelerated progress in the
field by providing a small animal model and enabling further understanding of the pathogenesis
of these enteric viruses. Yet a major limitation of this model system is that wild-type laboratory
mice have not been shown to develop overt disease when infected with MNV, in contrast to human
norovirus which is symptomatic in immunocompetent hosts. This limits the field’s ability to
elucidate norovirus-induced events responsible for disease. It should be noted, however, that all
virulence studies of MNV performed to date have used adult mice. Considering that human
norovirus infections are more severe in younger hosts, we hypothesized that young mice would
likewise be susceptible to MNV disease. We have generated exciting data confirming that oral
MNV infection causes acute self-resolving diarrhea in neonatal pups, a transformative discovery
for the norovirus field. Gastrointestinal disease severity is regulated by viral genetic determinants
and is associated with pathological changes to the intestinal epithelium although the main targets
of infection are intestinal immune cells. We propose to use this novel system to test our working
model that infection of intestinal immune cells leads to disruption of the epithelium and
consequent diarrhea. Our main objectives are to elucidate the viral determinants of diarrhea,
define the key immune cell targets of infection, and probe the interactions of the virus with the
intestinal epithelium. The integration of these aims will enable us to map key virus-host
interactions responsible for intestinal disease."

There is a worldwide need for improved treatment of systemic, life-threatening fungal infections.
Current therapies are limited by the small number of approved drugs, toxicities, drug-drug
interactions, mode of administration, and growing problems of drug resistance and emerging
pathogens. Treatment also suffers from a lack of rapid clinical diagnoses, leading to dependence
on broad-spectrum antifungal drugs. Moreover, existing antifungal drug classes target membrane
and cell wall integrity, and there is a need to develop drugs with new modes of action. Essential
genes are attractive antifungal drug targets because they are required for fungal pathogen growth
and survival. C. albicans is the major human fungal pathogen and has the most robust genetic
tools among the pathogenic fungi. We propose a “Redesigning Existing Drugs against
Indispensable Targets” (ReEDIT) strategy that focuses on essential genes in C. albicans that
have conserved human orthologs with known Chemically Tractable Inhibitors (CTIs) that are
approved drugs or are in clinical or preclinical development. ReEDIT is an integrative approach
using antifungal growth susceptibility, biochemical, structural, bioinformatic, and cheminformatic
data, as well as molecular modeling studies to prioritize potential fungal targets. The specific aims
of this Phase I proposal are to (1) identify essential genes in pathogenic fungi that encode
druggable targets and (2) advance at least one essential target and drug series into lead
optimization. The outcome will advance one or a small number of essential fungal targets and
drug candidate(s) into a program for lead optimization and pre-clinical studies (Phase II). The
long-term objectives are to develop inhibitors of novel essential fungal proteins into new classes
of broad-spectrum antifungal drugs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically
assess a comprehensive set of conserved essential fungal genes and cognate inhibitors
to be advanced for antifungal drug development."

 2 One in five pre- or postnatal women will develop a perinatal mood disorder (PMD). While temporary and
 3 treatable, 50-65% of mothers with PMD symptoms never receive a diagnosis or treatment due to inadequate
 4 screening practices. PMDs remain undetected because mothers do not trust clinicians due to fear of judgment,
 5 stigma, or even loss of parental rights. Untreated PMDs increase risk for maternal mortality, maternal suicide,
 6 preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse childhood experiences. There is an urgent unmet need for
 7 comprehensive, real-time perinatal mental health monitoring to connect women to effective treatment. To meet
 8 this need, BetterHope LLC (dba Poisera) is developing a technology platform to systemically monitor, screen,
 9 refer, and treat PMDs for women from early pregnancy through 36 months postpartum. The platform includes a
10 mobile health (mHealth) app, where a chatbot conversationally engages mothers in daily reflection exercises
11 about pregnancy, motherhood, and mental health. Each week, the chatbot prompts mothers to complete a
12 state-of-the-art, validated adaptive diagnostic screening for PMDs. When a woman screens positive for PMD
13 symptoms, the Poisera platform connects the woman to a Psychiatric Perinatal Access Program (PPAP),
14 where a behavioral health clinician (BHC) will assess risk, deliver a brief therapeutic intervention, and
15 coordinate long-term treatment. BHCs update her risk profile and treatment information in Poisera’s
16 dashboard, where the patient’s clinician can track treatment progress. PPAPs exist in 30 states. PPAPs are
17 proven to improve PMD symptoms and guarantee continuity of care. Using a chatbot to longitudinally monitor
18 and screen for PMDs is an innovative approach because chatbots promote honest disclosure and increase
19 adherence. Further, the Poisera platform transforms the current, inadequate clinical practice for PMD
20 screening and treatment to one where clinicians are confident their patients receive effective treatment at PMD
21 onset because the information is seamlessly integrated into their clinical workflow. The long-term goal of this
22 research is to eliminate adverse health consequences from PMDs. In this Phase I SBIR, we will demonstrate
23 the Poisera platform meets the needs of both pregnant women and clinicians. In Aim I, we will demonstrate
24 that pregnant women find the Poisera app and chatbot usable. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate obstetric
25 clinicians find the Poisera dashboard usable in their clinical workflows. In Aim 3, we will conduct a two-arm
26 feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure screening adherence and determine dropout behavior.
27 These outcomes will inform the design of our Phase II RCT, where we aim to demonstrate the Poisera platform
28 cost-effectively improves PMD outcomes for women from pregnancy to 36 months postpartum. Demonstrating
29 effective outcomes on these measures will provide us with the validation needed to sell the Poisera platform to
30 health systems and health insurers, a $2.8 billion annual market size.

 C. difficile now causes more hospital-onset infections and deaths in the US than any other pathogen and is
the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea among adults in industrialized countries. In 2017,
there were an estimated 462,100 combined healthcare- and community-associated C. difficile infection cases in
the US, and 20,500 in-hospital deaths. In a randomized trial, soap and water washing for 30 seconds reduced
but did not eliminate hand contamination in patients with CDI or asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile, whereas
alcohol hand hygiene had no effect. The hands of healthcare workers frequently become contaminated with C.
difficile spores, but hand washing with soap and water has only modest efficacy, and alcohol-based hand
sanitizers have essentially no efficacy against spores. Thus, there is an important unmet need for development
of effective strategies to reduce the burden of spores on hands. Given the concern that unrecognized
asymptomatic carriers contribute significantly to transmission, there is an urgent need for comprehensive
approaches applicable to persons who directly care for CDI patients, and also more generally for all hand
hygiene.
 We have developed a practical and highly innovative approach to meet this need through the development
of a sporicidal hand wash that is effective in significantly reducing C. difficile spores on skin. Our hand wash
formulation is based on the use of a new class of microstructured fluid (MSF) made with microfibrillated cellulose
which significantly enhances the removal of C. difficile spores from skin by physical and mechanical means
compared to traditional soap and water. The shear stresses generated at the skin surface during washing with
MSF are 10 to 100 times higher when compared to what can be obtained with traditional soap and water.
Importantly, we have recently discovered that when the microstructured fluid is made with the inclusion of novel
and skin-safe sporicidal ingredients at neutral pH, we are able to achieve ∼3.5 log reduction of C. difficile spores
from porcine skin in 30 seconds according to comprehensive testing. This discovery constitutes a significant
improvement over conventional soap and water, and in principal, should result in high assurance prevention of
transmitting C. difficile infection. This new discovery is significant since current alcohol-based hand sanitizers
are ineffective against C. difficile spores. This project is focused on: 1) optimizing and finalizing the MSF hand
washing formulation based on testing with an established skin model with the goal of achieving >3 log reduction
of C. diff spores and important HAI infections from skin; 2) manufacturing the MSF hand wash product under
GMP, performing compatibility/stability studies and developing quality control requirements; and 3) testing the
safety and tolerability of the MSF hand wash on skin as required by FDA."

One in ten children in the United States is born prematurely. The resultant atypical brain and nervous system
development puts them at risk for developmental problems. For example, preterm children are six times more
likely to have motor problems as they enter school-age. Research has also demonstrated that left untreated,
motor problems persist into adolescence and adulthood affecting a child's health throughout the lifespan.
Motor development requires both the learning and performance of motor skills. While differences in motor
performance between term and preterm children are supported by prior research, differences in the ability to
learn new motor skills are not well understood nor adequately studied. A comprehensive evaluation of motor
learning using controlled laboratory tasks would provide insight into motor learning processes and establish if
motor learning contributes to atypical motor development in this population. Therefore, the aim of this project
is to test the hypothesis that atypical motor development in preterm children is related to impaired motor
learning. Thirty-nine preterm children born before 32 weeks gestation, and 39 term-born children
(comparison group) ages 5-8 years old will be recruited to complete psychophysical tasks of motor learning
and clinical motor assessments across three testing sessions. In Aim 1, we will examine unimanual and
bimanual motor skill learning using a novel computerized visuomotor task involving use of a joystick to move
a cursor toward visual targets. The mapping of joystick-to-cursor movement will be manipulated to see how
children learn new visuomotor patterns. Bimanual skills will be tested because they are critical for functional
activities and may be specifically affected in preterm children due to the incomplete development of the
corpus callosum, a structure critical for bimanual control. Learning will be assessed by comparing
improvements on the first practice session and retention of performance one and seven days after the first
practice session. In Aim 2, motor performance will be systematically studied through tests of strength,
dexterity, coordination, executive function, and motor competence. The contributions of motor learning and
performance to a child's total development, measured with standardized clinical assessments, will be explored
statistically in Aim 3. This study has the potential to differentiate the factors of motor learning and performance
and how each contributes to delayed motor development in preterm children. Behavioral findings in this
proposal will guide future investigation into the neural correlates of motor performance and learning and could
help develop future physical and occupational therapy interventions grounded in neuroscience to address

 SARS-CoV-2, the etiological pathogen of COVID-19, has resulted in a pandemic. There remains an urgent
need for innovative technologies which facilitate the development of affordable antiviral precision medicine.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and the structure of the trimeric spike protein clusters on the virion has been
solved. To develop innovative, affordable, and biocompatible antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection
and transmission, we exploited the structural characteristics of viral surface proteins that can be matched at
nanoscale precision by engineered DNA nanostructure platforms. Based on the structure of the SARS-CoV-2
virion and surface spike trimer layout, we have synthesized a designer DNA nanostructure (DDN) that takes the
form of a macromolecular ‘net’ whose vertices are a precise mechanical match to the spacing and positioning of
the spike protein matrix displayed on the virus outer surface. We hypothesize that the structural properties and
the layout patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins can be exploited to design DDNs with nanoscale precision
which are capable of matching and capturing intact SARS-CoV-2 virions with ultrahigh binding avidity and
selectivity, thereby blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have screened and found DNA aptamers and
nanobodies that are specific for the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). These spike binders can be
incorporated into the ‘knots’ of the DDN net to allow the simultaneous binding of multiple DNA aptamers with
multiple spikes on the viral surface in a polyvalent, pattern-matching fashion. The DNA ‘net’-aptamer prototype
construct has afforded dramatic increase in SARS-CoV-2 binding avidity. This construct can work as a decoy to
block viral entry into host cells and is about 1,000-fold more potent than the free aptamer. In this R21 proposal,
we aim to extend this technology to enable the incorporation of multiple types of probes against spike RBD and
to validate the safety and effectiveness of DDNs in antiviral therapy in vitro and in vivo. We propose two specific
aims: to (1) design, synthesize, validate, and further optimize the virus-capturing avidity against various SARS-
CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs); and (2) to determine the antiviral potency and cytotoxicity of the designed
DDNs during SARS-CoV-2 infections in vitro in human lung epithelial cells and in vivo in human ACE2-knockin
mice. Completion of this work will help us define the antiviral potency and safety of the DNA nanostructures that
are designed to perfectly match epitope layouts on the viral surface to capture and wrap live viruses. The
estimated cost of DDN treatment is approximately $10/dose (a price that likely decreases at large-scale
synthesis), making it an affordable therapy. This DDN platform may further contribute to the rapid development
of antiviral precision medicine against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, as well as other enveloped viruses such
as influenza and HIV."
10708096,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This application “Restoring awareness of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes” proposes to elucidate the
heterogeneity of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes through completion of a 24-month
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) designed to better inform our understanding of the
clinical and physiologic factors which contribute to restoration of counterregulatory defenses against
hypoglycemia in response to educational, technologic, and pharmacologic interventions. Given the persistent
barrier of hypoglycemia to the realization of achieving adequate glycemic control for most individuals with type
1 diabetes, there is a critical need to further understand the mechanisms contributing to hypoglycemia in type 1
diabetes in order to advance treatment approaches that may realize the benefits of near-normal glycemic control
without the accompanying risk for severe hypoglycemia. The present proposal aims 1) to determine whether
counterregulatory responses to a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp can be restored in individuals with long
standing type 1 diabetes and IAH using an adaptive randomized clinical trial design implementing state-of-the-
art interventions including hypoglycemia avoidance education (standard-of-care; SOC), automated insulin
delivery with hybrid closed loop technology (HCL), and novel mini-dose glucagon (MDG) pharmacology; 2) to
determine the physiological factors associated with improved counterregulatory responses following intervention,
including but not limited to age, diabetes duration, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics; and 3) to
validate a HypoA-Q short form questionnaire as a self-report measure for identifying IAH with measurement of
counterregulatory responses derived from the hypoglycemic clamp. The proposed SMART study design will
allow for rigorously determining both the degree of hypoglycemia avoidance necessary for improvement of
counterregulatory epinephrine and autonomic symptom responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, as well as
the additional factors such as age, diabetes duration, other CGM metrics, and validated IAH self-report that may
predict individual responsiveness to SOC, HCL, and MDG interventions."
10748408,"The pathogenic mechanisms leading to subacute infective endocarditis (IE) are poorly understood, limiting the
development of preventative and therapeutic strategies. However, bacterial binding to platelets is accepted as
a key step in infection. Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus mitis are viridans group streptococci that are
common, but rarely studied, causes of IE. Terminal sialic acid is the major platelet receptor for many viridans
group streptococci. Until recently, all known streptococcal-sialic acid interactions were mediated by members
of the serine-rich repeat protein (SRRP) family of adhesins. That paradigm was shifted by identification of a
novel sialic acid-binding protein, AsaA, in S. oralis. Binding of both SRRPs and AsaA is mediated by sialic acid
immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-like domains. While most SRRPs contain one, AsaA contains two putative
Siglec-like domains. The first Siglec-like domain contains a sialic acid-binding motif; however, the second
Siglec-like domain is the first described to completely lack this motif. A polypeptide consisting of the two Siglec-
like and Unique domains directly binds sialic acid on platelets. However, the role of each Siglec-like domain
and the specific proteins bound are unknown. AsaA orthologs were identified in four IE-causing species with no
previously described mechanisms of adhesion. Together, these data led to the hypothesis that AsaA and
orthologs are members of a novel family of sialic acid-binding adhesins, that contribute to IE by binding host
components via two Siglec-like domains. Three aims will test this hypothesis. Aim 1: Determine the role of the
two AsaA Siglec-like domains in binding IE-relevant host components. Defined mutants and recombinantly
expressed proteins will be used to resolve the contribution of the two different Siglec-like domains to platelet
binding and to identify the specific proteins bound by each domain. Furthermore, the range of IE-relevant host
components bound by AsaA and the role of the two Siglec-like domains in these interactions will be
established. Aim 2: Determine whether AsaA is a member of a novel family of sialic acid-binding adhesins. The
role of AsaA orthologs in platelet binding will be investigated, with a focus on S. mitis. Aim 3: Determine the
contribution of AsaA, and specifically sialic acid binding, to IE using a 3D human microvessel model. A cutting-
edge physiologically relevant and tractable 3D microvessel model will be used to assess the role of sialic acid,
AsaA, and the Siglec-like domains in establishment of a vegetation. Furthermore, experiments will ascertain
whether this adhesion mechanism could be a therapeutic target. This application is significant as it focuses on
bacteria with no previously described mechanisms of binding platelets, a critical step in development of
subacute IE. Innovative aspects of this proposal include defining the function of a novel Siglec-like domain and
utilizing a cutting-edge 3D microvessel model. This study will also likely identify a novel family of sialic acid-
binding adhesins produced by multiple IE-causing species, which may bind the same receptor as SRRPs
making these interactions an attractive target for intervention."

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) represents a global clinical burden that affects over 5,000,000 people and can occur as
a result of chemical injury, chronic conditions such as systemic sclerosis, or respiratory infections such as
influenza and COVID-19. Commonly, PF has no clinically determinable cause and is diagnosed as idiopathic
PF, which presents a median survival time of only 2-4 years after diagnosis. Given the often unclear
pathogenesis of PF, there exists a strong clinical need to elucidate the biological mechanisms that contribute to
its onset and progression. Nevertheless, the factors that drive spatial heterogeneity and temporal progression in
fibrotic architecture are not well understood. Furthermore, the post-fibrotic resolution of aberrant PF matrix
remains an elusive goal, for which no single-cell characterizations have been performed to date. Thus, this
project aims to establish a spatiotemporal atlas of PF progression that links multi-omics with spatially
defined tissue neighborhoods and temporally defined architectural states of fibrosis and post-fibrotic
resolution.
Mesenchymal cell populations play a critical role in the fibrosis of all major organs, with a number of macrophage
and fibroblast subtypes often implicated as mediators of fibrotic ECM deposition. Based on prior studies, I
hypothesize that transcriptionally defined macrophage and fibroblast subtypes act as both spatial and temporal
nodes of fibrosis and post-fibrotic resolution. To investigate this hypothesis, this project will establish a novel
computational atlas of transcriptional/epigenetic cell subtypes, interaction networks, and ultrastructural states
that mediate the pathological progression of PF and post-fibrotic repair in mice. Specific Aim 1 will investigate
the roles of transcriptionally defined cell subpopulations in the temporal progression and resolution of fibrotic
pulmonary architecture, using high-throughput multi-omics (transcriptomic, epigenomic, and ultrastructural) and
computational modeling of biological variations over time. Specific Aim 2 will define the spatial tissue
neighborhoods of cell- and matrix- mediated interactions in pulmonary fibrosis, by integrating Visium spatial
transcriptomics, imputed spatial epigenomics in BABEL, and ultrastructural quantification on consecutive
histological slices. Specific Aim 3 will develop a machine learning algorithm for prognosis of clinical outcomes in
human pulmonary fibrosis, by unifying histopathological architecture, protein and cell spatial networks, and
clinical metadata. Ultimately, this project will establish a multi-omic, cross-species, and computationally rigorous
atlas of PF progression and repair that identifies biologically conserved mechanistic pathways and clinically
relevant targets for prognosis and therapeutic development."
10823218,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The microbiota is a critical frontline barrier that protects the host from invading microorganisms and keeps
resident opportunists in check. Frank pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm),
however, are adept at overcoming microbiota-mediated colonization resistance to cause dysbiosis and disease.
Under homeostasis, antimicrobial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the microbiota protect the host
by restricting pathogen replication through cytosol acidification. During infection, STm uses its type III secretion
systems (T3SS) to trigger an inflammatory response that depletes SCFA-producing commensals. Current
paradigm holds that the depletion of SCFA-producing species is a pre-requisite for luminal STm expansion.
However, using an antibiotic-naïve mouse model we have observed that STm blooms 1000-fold 3-4 days prior
to the onset of overt inflammation when SCFAs are abundant and the community composition of the microbiota
is undisturbed. This implies that STm employs an as-of-yet undescribed strategy to restore pH homeostasis and
grow in the presence of SCFAs during gastrointestinal colonization. Our preliminary findings suggest that proton-
consuming metabolic pathways, including the amino acid decarboxylases CadA and SpeF, alleviate SCFA
growth inhibition in vitro and are required for full virulence in vivo, yet it is unclear whether these pathways
specifically mediate growth in the presence of SCFAs within the host, or how STm secures the metabolites that
fuel these pathways in the nutrient-restricted gastrointestinal environment. I hypothesize that during colonization
of the gastrointestinal tract, STm uses its T3SS to obtain host-derived amino acids that fuel proton-consuming
reactions and restore pH homeostasis in the presence of commensal-produced SCFAs.
 The objective of this application is to elucidate how STm adapts to the intestinal environment and to use
this understanding to develop my own independent research program that investigates how enteric pathogens
overcome intrinsic protective barriers so that we may uncover new therapeutic approaches for bolstering
colonization resistance in high-risk patients. In AIM1 we will assess the contribution of proton-consuming
metabolic pathways in restoring pH homeostasis and growth in the presence of SCFAs in vitro, and investigate
the role these pathways play in mediating early ecosystem invasion in vivo using conventional and gnotobiotic
animal models. In AIM2 we will use bacterial genetics, murine infection models, and metabolomics to determine
how STm uses its virulence factors to engineer a new gastrointestinal niche that supports dysbiotic
Enterobacteriaceae expansion under homeostatic conditions. This mechanistic approach to microbiota research
will provide causal links between pathogen-mediated environmental remodeling and changes in microbial growth
conditions that cannot be gleaned from solely cataloging bacterial species. Successful completion of this work
will reveal opportunities to enhance innate host defenses by identifying and targeting the metabolic pathways
enteric pathogens use to overcome colonization resistance."

Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to cancer but can also present
with unilateral bowing of the tibia that often progresses to fracture. Unlike the robust bone
healing of most children, bone healing in these patients fails, leading to invasive and repeated
surgeries, and often amputation of the leg. Research focused on identifying the cause of this
refractory bone healing revealed that Nf1 deficiency in bone mesenchymal progenitors blunts
their osteogenic potential and triggers chronic and uncontrolled RAS/ERK signaling, although
blocking this pathway failed to rescue osteoprogenitor differentiation and the delayed bone
healing of mice lacking Nf1 is osteoprogenitors. It has now become clear that multiple signaling
pathways and compensatory mechanisms are involved in the abnormal differentiation of Nf1-
null osteoprogenitors, and that targeting them to promote bone union in children with NF1 will be
very challenging. This proposal steers away from this strategy, thanks to the observation of
early senescence in Nf1-null osteoprogenitors, which should make them sensitive to “senolytic”
drugs. Our hypothesis is thus that eliminating Nf1-null osteoprogenitors - rather than correcting
their multiple defects – with senolytics will promote bone union in children with NF1
pseudarthrosis. We propose to determine if clearance of Nf1-null senescent osteoprogenitors,
genetically or pharmacologically, improves the poor healing potential of mice lacking Nf1 in
osteoprogenitors, and whether the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) from
these cells alters the behavior of lineages contributing to bone repair. A second major premise
of this work is the observation that mice deficient for Nf1 selectively in adult osteoprogenitors
lose muscle mass. This finding and other in vitro and in vivo results led us to challenge the
current view of a muscle-intrinsic defect and to address the hypothesis that bone-derived
factor(s) from Nf1-null osteoprogenitors contribute to the muscle weakness observed in children
with NF1, which could also be alleviated by the clearance of Nf1-null osteoprogenitors with
senolytics. Overall, this work has the potential to improve the clinical management of NF1
pseudarthrosis with a strategy that will pharmacologically clear faulty Nf1-null osteoprogenitors
and relieve their inhibitory influence on other cells contributing to bone repair, thus restoring
robust bone regeneration. Mechanistically, this study may support senescence in Nf1-null
osteoprogenitors as a mechanism to prevent the spread of RAS-induced mutational damage
and preclude potential malignant transformation at the cost of a deleterious bystander effect on
bone repair and muscle function."
10816504,"Project Summary/Abstract. This application for a K01 award describes the research & mentoring plans and
coursework for Dr. Alexander Kaizer, an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at the University
of Colorado-Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC), to achieve advancement towards independent research in
the use of adaptive designs for cardiovascular outcome clinical trials that facilitate information sharing across
different sources of data to improve the statistical efficiency of evaluating new therapies. The process to develop
effective novel treatments traditionally proceeds through a series of studies and phases. Conventionally, each
phase is treated independently from previous phases, which are traditionally only used in the design stage of a
new trial. This represents a potentially inefficient use of all available data that could be incorporated beyond the
design stage and represents an important limitation for newer trial designs that may include multiple treatments
within the context of a single protocol, but where comparisons only use concurrently collected data. The statistical
methodologies and trial designs proposed in this application address this limitation by developing new methods
to facilitate information sharing along with applications to platform trial designs. In this award, the development of
statistical methods will be coupled with formal training in the biology of the cardiovascular system to assure that
these new methods have seamless application in the design of cardiovascular outcomes research. To achieve
the training goals and research aims laid out in this K01, a research team of three mentors has been assembled.
Dr. John Kittelson, Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at CU-AMC, is an expert in clinical trial design
and has extensive experience with cardiovascular trial implementation and analysis. Dr. Gregory Schwartz,
Professor of Medicine at CU-AMC and Chief of the Cardiology Section at the VA Medical Center, is a leader in
proposing, implementing, and disseminating cardiovascular outcome clinical trials. Dr. Robert Eckel, Professor
of Medicine at CU-AMC, past President of the American Heart Association, and President-elect of the American
Diabetes Association, is an expert in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and diabetes.
In Aim 1, we will develop statistical methods for incorporating data from supplemental sources, such as past
trials, into the analysis of a current study based on their exchangeability (i.e., equivalence) after adjusting for
covariates (also known as information sharing). In Aim 2, we will develop adaptive platform trial designs that
consider new treatment arms compared to a shared control arm. To improve the accessibility of the new methods,
user-friendly software will be developed (Aim 3). The methods and designs from these aims will be evaluated
via rigorous simulation study to understand their small sample properties under various scenarios. Methods
will be illustrated through application to previously conducted cardiovascular trial data available from the NHLBI
BioLINCC. Together, these methods for information sharing and adaptive trial designs will improve the efficiency
of the research process and take fuller advantage of available information for statistical inference."

 Heart failure is a global pandemic affecting over 26 million patients worldwide including over 5 million
Americans with over 550,000 newly diagnosed cases each year in the USA. The annual cost of treatment in
our country is approaching 40 billion dollars. The incidence of heart failure increases with age and is markedly
higher among minority populations. Therefore, heart failure presents a major health problem in the United
States as well as worldwide. Exercise intolerance is a classic symptom of heart failure. Often extreme
activation of the sympathetic nervous system occurs during exercise causing profound peripheral
vasoconstriction. High sympathetic activity is predictive of poor prognosis. Our recent studies have shown
that the kidney, skeletal muscle and even the heart become targets for vasoconstriction with this veritable
“sympathetic storm”. The mechanisms mediating this exaggerated activation of the sympathetic nervous
system during exercise in subjects with heart failure are poorly understood. This competing renewal proposal
is focused on expanding our investigations of altered neural control of cardiovascular function during exercise
in heart failure. We propose that sympathetic over-activation during exercise stems from activation of multiple
regional afferent nerves which combine to induce positive-feedback amplification of sympathetic activity
creating vicious cycles. The kidney, skeletal muscle and the heart become both the sources of afferent
activation of sympathetic activity and the targets of the increased vasoconstrictor tone. Further, depressed
arterial baroreflex buffering of these positive feedback scenarios contributes to the excessive sympatho-
activation. We will explore techniques aimed at lessening the activation of these regional afferents which
would thereby decrease the massive sympathetic activation. We will utilize our innovative and highly complex
conscious, chronically instrumented canine model. Our long term goal is to elucidate further the mechanisms
responsible for the heightened activation of the sympathetic nervous system during exercise in heart failure
and the functional consequences of these responses in integrative control of cardiovascular function. A major
strength of the proposal is our unique capability of simultaneous measurement of critical central and peripheral
hemodynamic parameters in real time at rest and during exercise in the same animals before and after
induction of heart failure. These longitudinally designed experiments will provide compelling new information
on the altered mechanisms of cardiovascular control during exercise in heart failure and may provide a basis
for ameliorating the excessive activation of the sympathetic nervous system during exercise in these patients."

 The hand’s sophisticated neuromuscular system enables us to interact with the world in a myriad of ways,
one of which is dexterous manipulation. The hand’s incredible versatility, however, comes at a cost: when
peripheral neuropathies, neurological disorders or traumatic injury occur, our ability to improve sensorimotor
function is severely challenged by our limited understanding of the hand’s sensorimotor control mechanisms.
Therefore, improving our understanding of these mechanisms could enhance the impact of clinical intervention.
This notion has driven extensive research over the past four decades aiming at unravelling how the hand’s
sensorimotor control mechanisms operate. Previous research has provided significant insights into the
coordination of digit forces required to prevent object slip. Surprisingly, however, this previous work neglected
to address another important component of manipulation: the ability to control object position and orientation,
i.e., pose. This is a critical gap because dexterous manipulation often requires both object slip prevention and
dexterous control of object pose. To address this gap, in the past decade our laboratory has developed an
experimental paradigm that allows subjects to choose where to grasp the object and contains a dexterity
component, i.e., lifting an object straight while preventing it from tilting. Nevertheless, the major limitation of
this work is that the modulation of load and grip forces cannot be decoupled to identify their relative contribution
to object slip prevention and pose control. To fill this gap, we propose an approach that will allow us, for the
first time, to identify the control mechanisms underlying grasp and manipulation. Our approach combines a
task with a dexterity component, surface electromyography of digit muscles, and a novel application of digit
force analysis developed for robotic manipulation. Our task requires subjects to coordinate digit forces to
simultaneously prevent object slip and minimize object tilt. Our analysis can mathematically decouple digit
forces into grasp force (object slip prevention) and manipulation force (object pose control). We will pursue two
aims: (1) To determine the causal relation between grasp and manipulation forces, and (2) To quantify the
effect of predictability of object properties on the coordination between grasp and manipulation forces. If
successful, this new knowledge will enable clinicians to extract information about the state of the hand’s
sensorimotor function that cannot otherwise be extracted by clinical assessment tools. Our long-term objective
is to improve the theoretical constructs of dexterous manipulation control and their translation to clinical
applications, including tools for quantifying recovery of hand function following clinical intervention, as well as
design of assistive and/or rehabilitation devices."
10814226,"ABSTRACT
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is an enormous and growing public health problem that is associated with
significant cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and kidney failure, in addition to posing a significant economic
burden for the US health system. Patients with DKD experience significant gaps in the delivery of guideline-
recommended treatments for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and kidney failure. Previously studied
interventions intended to address these gaps have relied on overburdened primary care teams and have
shown only modest success. The overall goal of the proposed research is to design and pilot an intervention of
proactive nephrology e-consultation which leverages the electronic health record to identify patients with DKD
who might benefit from nephrology expertise, but whose kidney disease is not severe enough to require in-
person nephrology referral. As part of this intervention, nephrologists would perform targeted, automated
consultations (TACos) for eligible patients by reviewing patient charts and providing individualized
recommendations focused on delivering guideline-indicated DKD care. For health systems with limited
subspecialist capacity for in-person visits, TACos offer a “high-touch” approach to extending subspecialty
expertise in collaboration with primary care to reach a broader population. For DKD, TACos have the potential
to promote both utilization of established DKD therapies and uptake of novel therapies, such as sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors. The specific aims of this project are 1) to conduct semi-structured interviews
of primary care clinicians and nephrologists to understand the most helpful elements of a TACo intervention; 2)
to use a microsimulation modeling approach to determine the best strategies for targeting TACos for optimizing
impact and equity based on existing practice patterns in a local setting; and 3) to evaluate the feasibility and
acceptability of a pilot implementation of TACos in one public health care delivery system.
To accomplish the goals and to prepare Dr. Chu for an independent research career as an implementation
scientist focused on improving chronic kidney disease care, he will be mentored by a team of experts in
qualitative research methods, kidney disease epidemiology, simulation modeling, and implementation science.
Specifically, this proposal will allow the Dr. Chu to achieve the following training goals: 1) undertake formal
didactic and mentored training in implementation science; 2) develop skills to design and conduct qualitative
research studies to inform intervention design; 3) learn to apply simulation modeling approaches to predict
potential impact of interventions; and 4) gain experience conducting a pilot study that implements and
evaluates a care delivery intervention. Completion of these aims will generate the preliminary data and provide
a training foundation to support an R-level proposal to study the effectiveness of TACos or other population
health approaches to improve DKD care in diverse health systems."
10873703,"Project Summary/Abstract: Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a malignant bone and soft-tissue tumor with extremely poor
prognosis for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease. In the absence of representative genetic models, the
developmental cell of origin as well as the mechanisms of tumor initiation remain poorly understood. To address
those questions, I have developed an innovative zebrafish model of ES by introducing the human EWSR1-FLI1
oncofusion to the zebrafish genome. This model allows studying the behavior of GFP-labeled cancer cells during
tumor initiation and progression in a complex developmental context which is not currently possible in mammals.
The fish develop tumors positive for known ES markers, recapitulating the main aspects of human disease.
Preliminary data reveal dysregulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) metabolism and associated
activation of ERK signaling in ES cells. Targeting HSPGs with the specific antagonist surfen reduces ERK1/2
signaling and decreases tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. My preliminary data suggest that dysregulated HSPG
turnover can affect normal cell differentiation leading to cell transformation. I hypothesize that such HSPG-
mediated dysregulation of signaling between cancer and normal cells can facilitate ES progression.
 The aims outlined in this proposal will take advantage of the genetic model of ES in combination with
innovative single-cell transcriptomic, genetic, and high-resolution imaging approaches to characterize the type
of cells giving rise to ES (Aim 1), identify key effectors in cancer and cancer niche cells promoting the cancer
progression (Aim 2), and to target HSPG mediated signaling in genetic zebrafish and xenograft mouse models
for ES treatment (Aim 3). Aim1 will be completed in the K99 phase and will be co-mentored by Dr. Crump. Aims
2 and 3 will be initiated during the K99 phase under the mentorship of Dr. Amatruda and my advisory committee
and then completed during the R00 phase. Completion of these aims will inform what type of cells contribute to
ES development. These findings will determine the role of HSPG in tumor initiation and progression building the
foundation for a new strategy of targeting the enzymes involved in HSPG metabolism for ES treatment.
 The proposed project will lay the groundwork for my career goal of obtaining a position as a tenure-track
Assistant Professor at a top-tier academic research institution. During the K99 phase, I will receive mentorship
in zebrafish and cancer biology from Dr. Amatruda and training in developmental biology from my co-mentor Dr.
Crump. Regular interactions with my other advisory committee will allow me to acquire new expertise in single-
cell genomics and tumor microenvironment (Dr. Asgharzadeh), ES pathology (Dr. Triche), and data analysis (Dr.
Gai). Both CHLA and USC will provide extensive resources for my career and professional development. As
CHLA hosts one of the most experienced communities of pediatric cancer biologists, and USC is a home for
experts in developmental and stem cell biology there are few better places to conduct this research dedicated to
developmental aspects of ES development to acquire the training to achieve my career goals."
10768765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Humans born before 34-36 weeks of gestation age have low nephron endowment and a 2-3-fold increased risk
of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preterm infants are also at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), which is
a unique pathogenic process as injury occurs during a critical window of postnatal renal growth and maturation.
However, due to limited animal models and few preterm human kidney biopsies, the cellular and molecular basis
of AKI and CKD in premature kidneys is poorly understood, treatment is supportive, and we lack strategies to
prevent AKI and the development of CKD in this population. We have generated a novel mouse model of
congenitally low nephron number that simulates human premature kidneys and propose a 5-year career
development project that is designed to fill the unmet needs. I induced neonatal AKI with gentamicin, a
nephrotoxic medication often prescribed to preterm infants, and discovered that mice with low nephron number
have more severe AKI, sustained inflammation and rapid progression to CKD compared to littermate controls
with normal nephron number. I have also identified a unique inflammatory profile following gentamicin-induced
AKI in mice with low nephron number. I hypothesize that increased gentamicin uptake in proximal tubules of
mice with low nephron number leads to more cell injury and death, causing profound and sustained inflammation,
impairing renal growth, and accelerating the development of CKD. Aim 1 will determine the cellular basis for
more severe gentamicin-induced injury and inflammation by assessing for increased gentamicin uptake and
accumulation, and then by determining whether gentamicin accumulation causes lysosomal and mitochondrial
damage and resultant inflammation. We will determine which cell death pathways are activated after gentamicin-
induced injury in mice with low nephron number, the discovery of which could inform future targeted therapies.
In Aim 2 we will study the effect of gentamicin-induced renal inflammation on renal growth and the development
of CKD in mice with low nephron number. We will take the unbiased approach of single cell RNA sequencing
and analyze pathways regulating cell metabolism, growth, inflammation, and cell death in mice with normal and
low nephron number after acute injury, and during a critical period of postnatal renal growth and maturation. The
discovery-based studies have the potential to guide future molecular targeting approaches to abrogate the
development of CKD in humans born preterm. The career development strategy proposed will allow Dr. Good to
acquire the training necessary to become a successful physician scientist studying the cellular and molecular
basis of renal health and disease in a growing population of humans born preterm. Dr. Good is a neonatologist
and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Columbia University, where she completed her clinical training and
research fellowship. With the support of a rich institutional environment and the dedication of her mentors, Drs.
Fangming Lin and Jonathan Barasch, Dr. Good will be well positioned to transition to independence."
10734790,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Toxoplasma gondii has the remarkable ability to infect virtually any cell type of almost all warm-blooded
animals and is arguably the most successful parasite on earth, having infected an estimated one-third of
humans globally. While initial infection typically resolves without complication, the parasite is able to persist
for the life of its host, and can re-emerge in the immunocompromised and immunosuppressed to cause fatal
disease. Toxoplasma, like other apicomplexan parasites, has an unusual cell cycle in which daughter cells
are fully assembled within a mother before cytokinesis. Because of its unusual features and regulatory
checkpoints distinct from mammalian hosts, the parasite cell cycle is an ideal target for therapy
 In the final steps of Toxoplasma division, the mother cell organelles and cytoskeleton are degraded to
make room for the daughter cells. Because the daughter cells must insert their own cytoskeleton, including
the host cell invasion machinery, into the plasma membrane, this is a critical point in parasite assembly.
Once divided, the daughter cells remain connected through a poorly understood organelle called the
residual body. While the residual body was first described over 60 years ago, little is know about it. We have
found that maternal cytoskeleton is actively stripped from the plasma membrane and delivered to the
residual body, where it is then degraded. We have identified a ubiquitin E3 ligase that localizes to the
residual body, and is essential to the turnover of maternal cytoskeleton. Moreover, we have shown that
mistargeting of the E3 outside of the residual body results in premature degradation of the daughter cells'
invasion machinery, blocking the infective cycle. We have therefore identified the sequestration of protein
turnover as a major cellular function for the residual body.
 The goal of the proposed studies is to (i) understand the functional role of the residual body in
Toxoplasma cytokinesis and the turnover of maternal materials, and (ii) to delineate the components of the
ubiquitination cascade that targets the parasite cytoskeleton. We will determine what other organelles and
structures are delivered to the residual body for turnover and identify the proteins that sequester E3 ligase
activity and cytoskeleton degradation within the residual body. Furthermore, we will build the components
required for the creation of an innovative reconstitution of the E3 ligase activity that will enable future
studies towards generating a mechanistic model of maternal cytoskeleton turnover."
10835935,"The rising prevalence of obesity throughout the world represents a major public health challenge for the
21st century. Although several new therapies seem likely to be approved, the most effective long-term treatments
for obesity are surgical, while current behavioral interventions focused on diet fail 90% of the time. A major
challenge in dieting is controlling food intake in the face of our rich sensory environment that includes many
sensory cues that have become associated with foods. These sensory cues elicit cravings and food-seeking
behavior even in the absence of physiologic need. The amygdala and related brain structures such as
orbitofrontal cortex mediate associative learning processes, and the processing of sensory cues in these areas
can modulate food consumption. However, the precise neural circuit mechanisms through which cues modulated
consumption remain poorly understood, and their interaction with homeostatic signals that limit food intake are
completely unknown. Indeed, studying how sensory cues promote feeding in circumstances when homeostatic
signals limit consumption has been difficult to study. Here, we propose to study the circuits and mechanism by
which sensory cues drive feeding behavior in the absence of hunger, i.e. during acute satiety following a meal
and when mice have been overfed to induce hypophagia. We train mice to associate specific sensory cues, e.g.
a tone, with rewarding foods, and later use the cue to increase food consumption. We use this behavioral
paradigm to test the ability of sensory cues to challenge the return to baseline body weight that occurs following
over-feeding, and also to test whether this leads to a higher body weight set-point. We will use state-of-the art
neuroscience tools including viral-mediated circuit tracing, activity-dependent recombinant expression of genes,
calcium imaging, whole-brain histology, and optogenetics to test the hypothesis that amygdala-related circuits
drive cue-induced feeding behaviors via the lateral hypothalamus, and can drive feeding during the absence of
hunger. In Aim 1, we will express calcium indicators in amygdala related circuits to study the encoding of sensory
stimuli during cue-induced feeding. We then use optogenetics to test whether these areas are necessary and
sufficient to modulate cue-induced feeding behaviors. In Aim 2, we will combine cue-induced feeding with
overfeeding to test the ability of cue-induced feeding to cause weight gain, and circuit-elements involved in this
process. Understanding the neural mechanisms whereby sensory cues can drive feeding-behavior in the
absence of physiologic need will help us understand environmental contributors to obesity, and why long-term
success in dieting and weight-loss is rare. These studies may ultimately help identify targets for treatment and
prevention of obesity."
10825540,"Project summary:
This proposal aims to develop advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI)
techniques to rapidly and accurately identify sites with late mechanical activation (LMA) and
compute circumferential uniformity estimate with singular value decomposition (CURE-SVD) from
standard cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Our long-term goal is to develop
networks that can determine LMA sites / CURE-SVD automatically from cine images acquired at
any CMR facility worldwide, thereby addressing a critical need in the effective guidance of device-
based therapies, such as Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), for potentially millions of heart
failure patients. To accomplish this goal, we will make use of a rich and unique dataset we have
assembled at our institution based on over 200 patients undergoing CRT with a median follow-up
of five years. The data set includes demographics and comorbid diseases from EHR review, pre-
CRT/post-CRT imaging with CMR cine/DENSE/LGE (late gadolinium enhancement),
echocardiography, and multidimensional response parameters based on overall survival, serum
B-type natriuretic peptide testing, quality of life questionnaires, and exercise testing for peak VO2.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that these ML/AI methods will effectively identify the
characteristics of scar-free LMA sites from cine imaging, achieving excellent agreement
compared with the original DENSE-based assessments, and predict post-CRT outcomes. Our
specific aims are (i) identifying LMA sites and computing CURE-SVD by developing joint neural
networks with inputs from cine SSFP/GRE images, (ii) with the addition of scar from LGE in the
network, we will develop a novel multi-task learning to consider scar information in the
determination of LMA sites free of scar, and (iii) comparing the performance of our proposed
methods with ground truth DENSE and results obtained from commercial feature tracking
software to predict CRT outcomes in the dataset with 200+ CRT patients with complete CRT
response data and long-term follow-up for survival and arrhythmia outcomes."
10792945,"Project Summary
Age-related reductions in muscle contractile performance are mediated by reductions in muscle size (atrophy)
and alterations in actin-myosin cross bridge function that are independent of size. Together, they contribute to
sarcopenia, the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. A hallmark of sarcopenia is the loss of
contractile power (= product of force and velocity) which, in turn, predicts physical dysfunction, and mobility
disability. Importantly, contractile power declines earlier in life and more precipitously than reductions in
contractile force or muscle size, thereby suggesting that power is subject to the influence of unique
mechanisms. During repeated contractions of high velocity, muscle fatigability is also increased with age, such
that older, healthy adults experience a much greater reduction in muscular power over the course of a
single bout of repeated voluntary contractions. In combination, these aspects of muscle aging leave older
adults at greater risk of falls and physical impairments during repetitious activities (stair climbing, walking etc.).
Somewhat paradoxically, muscle tension (force per unit cross sectional area) has been shown to increase
with age when contractile velocity is zero (isometric). Similarly, older adults are less fatigable during
isometric contractions. This constellation of poorly understood functional characteristics defines an Aging
Phenotype of skeletal muscle whose mechanisms may reveal important targets for intervention for improving
physical function in older adults with sarcopenia. We propose that alterations in cross-bridge level biology in
the aging sarcomere contribute to velocity-dependent contractile dysfunction and will perform experiments in
human skeletal muscle to test the hypothesis that the sarcomeric protein Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C)
is central to this phenomenon.
MyBP-C is a regulatory protein located near the center of the sarcomere, known to modulate myocardial
contractility via phosphorylation-dependent interactions with the thin and thick filaments. While skeletal and
cardiac isoforms of MyBP-C are highly conserved and share structural and sequence homology, it is not clear
whether MyBP-C has similar phosphorylation-dependent influences on skeletal muscle contractility. Recent
pre-clinical studies suggest skeletal MyBP-C phosphorylation influences contractile force and velocity, and age
and fatiguing contractions alter phosphorylation differentially. Our studies in isolated human single muscle
fibers will translate pre-clinical evidence to humans and allow us to interrogate the influence of MyBP-C on age
and fatigue-related changes in skeletal muscle contractility. We will identify post translational modifications to
sarcomeric proteins with age and fatigue while screening for other candidates of interest within the human
muscle cell. These studies will reveal important information regarding the poorly understood Aging Phenotype
of Skeletal Muscle while establishing foundational data supporting the pursuit of molecular targets for
interventions with the goal of improving clinical outcomes in older adults."
10758557,"ABSTRACT
Suicide deaths and social disconnection among older adults are increasingly serious public health concerns. A 'Wish
To Die' (WTD) is an indicator of passive suicide ideation which refers to thoughts of one’s own death, that one would
be better off dead, or wishing for one’s death. The association between social disconnection and suicide is widely
recognised and social disconnection has been shown to be associated with an increased likelihood of WTD.
Importantly, social disconnection is a multi-faceted construct and both the quantity (social isolation) and quality
(loneliness) of people’s social relationships are strongly related to both suicide ideation and subsequent suicide
attempts. While this association is well-established, the mechanistic pathways to explain the association are less well
understood. The main putative mechanisms proposed are: behavioral (sleep, physical activity, smoking, alcohol
consumption), psychological (depression, anxiety, and ageing perceptions), and physiological (neuroendocrine,
immune function, and cardiometabolic).
This study leverages data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) to identify the pathways that explain
the association between social disconnection and passive suicidal ideation. TILDA is a large, nationally
representative, prospective cohort study that examines the social, economic and health circumstances of 8,500+
community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and older in Ireland. TILDA data have been collected every two years since
2009 and includes both survey data (CAPI and SCQ) and a comprehensive clinic-based health assessment. Detailed
biomarker data are available from these health assessments and include markers from the neuroendocrine, immune,
cardiometabolic, and parasympathetic systems.
Using this longitudinal data, the study aims to: (1) Identify who is at highest risk of social disconnection and WTD
among older adults as well as when individuals are most at risk; (2) Examine the nature of the associations between
social disconnection and WTD, including strength, temporality, and directionality, among older adults; (3) Identify
mechanistic pathways that explain the association between social disconnection and WTD. To address these aims,
four waves of survey and two waves of biomarker data will be investigated and advanced longitudinal statistical
techniques (GLMM, latent growth curve, latent class growth analysis, and SEM path analysis) will be applied.
Given the complex nature of this study, we have assembled an outstanding multi-disciplinary team of clinical and
academic researchers with expertise in each of the constituent parts of the project. By establishing the causal
pathways between social disconnection and WTD, study results will identify important risk and protective factors for
suicidal ideation that are amenable to intervention. In doing so, the study will inform effective clinical and
community-based interventions by which the train of thoughts leading to active suicidal ideation can be stopped
before individuals progress to active ideation and suicidal behavior."

Natural selection purges deleterious mutations from populations in genomic regions impacting survival or
reproductive capacity. Recent genetic studies of massive population cohorts have revealed a continuous
distribution across the human genome of this constraint on deleterious mutations. Large-scale association
studies have found mutations in strongly constrained genomic regions to be major risk factors in many childhood
developmental disorders (DDs), suggesting that highly constrained sequences are likely to play key roles in
development. However, genetic studies of fetal demise after the first trimester (FD), an extreme outcome of DDs,
have thus far been limited in scope and size. The establishment by my mentors of an international Fetal
Genomics Consortium to sequence 10,500 samples (3,500 FD cases and their family members) ascertained for
FD of suspected genetic etiology now offers an unprecedented opportunity to illuminate the most extreme
consequences of mutation across individual genes and dosage sensitive genomic segments critical for human
development. In this fellowship, I will integrate whole-genome sequencing and autopsy data from this cohort
together with data from previously established DD cohorts to discover and functionally characterize mutationally
intolerant loci in the human genome. I will first define patterns of genetic variation in FD across constraint metrics
(loss-of-function, missense, and noncoding) and genomic variation classes (point mutations, indels, structural
variants, and repeat expansions), and investigate biases in these patterns with respect to fetal sex and mutational
parent-of-origin. I will then adapt a statistical framework for disease association capable of integrating evidence
from all coding and noncoding variant classes with prioritization of constrained regions, which I will apply to
perform novel gene discovery in FD (Aim 1). I will leverage these findings to generate functional predictions of
mutationally intolerant loci by defining the biological networks of activity and the cell types in which they are likely
to operate early in development (Aim 2). Finally, I will test these functional hypotheses across DDs that do not
result in FD, including liveborn fetal structural abnormalities, neurodevelopmental disorders, and congenital
anomalies (Aim 3). In parallel with these research aims, an exceptional team of six mentors and advisors across
multiple disciplines, career stages, and institutions will provide didactic training, hands-on research support,
regular opportunities for presentation in seminars and conferences, and a variety of soft skill development
sessions that directly align with my career objectives during my PhD training. Collectively, the aims outlined in
this proposal will take advantage of unique tools and resources to yield novel insights into the etiology of the
extremes along the continuum of developmental anomalies and evolutionary constraint, and will serve as an
outstanding training opportunity for me in computational, statistical, and functional disease genomics."
10771228,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited kidney disease. The goal of this study is
to determine if renal interstitial myofibroblasts play an essential role in ADPKD progression by undergoing
autophagy and supplying nutrients that support cyst growth. While myofibroblasts are known to be important for
renal fibrosis, our novel preliminary data suggests that myofibroblasts could directly regulate cyst growth in
ADPKD kidneys by paracrine mechanisms. We found that secreted factors from cyst epithelial cells such as
lactate, stimulate autophagy in myofibroblasts by a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α)- dependent mechanism.
Moreover, factors such as glutamine, secreted by ADPKD renal myofibroblast- by a HIF1α and autophagy
dependent mechanism increased proliferation and cyst growth of human ADPKD cyst epithelial cells. Hence,
we hypothesize that, cyst epithelial cells use paracrine mechanisms to induce autophagy in myofibroblasts,
leading to secretion of cyst-growth promoting factors. Aim 1 will test if reducing the renal myofibroblast population
will reduce cyst growth in mouse ADPKD kidneys. Aim 2 will determine the role of myofibroblast-specific HIF1α
in cyst growth. In Aim 3, the role of myofibroblast-specific autophagy and metabolites secreted by myofibroblasts
in cyst-expansion will be examined. In addition to the innovative hypothesis, our studies will use state of the art
transgenic and tissue specific gene knockout mice and identify myofibroblast -specific secreted factors, important
for regulation of cyst growth in ADPKD kidneys. These studies are significant because we test a novel and
fundamental mechanism by which cyst epithelial cells manipulate myofibroblasts in their microenvironment to
produce nutrients to support cyst growth and disease progression in ADPKD. Although altered metabolism,
hypoxia, autophagy, and the role of the cyst microenvironment in cyst growth are emerging fields in ADPKD
pathophysiology, the importance of myofibroblast-mediated regulation of cyst growth is unclear. This study will
build on our lab's strengths in studying ADPKD pathophysiology, with co-investigators and collaborators who are
leaders in the fields of PKD, hypoxia, metabolism or autophagy. The results are expected to lead to development
of better therapies for ADPKD."
10911885,"Genomic and Chromatin Analysis Core (Core B): SUMMARY
 The Genomic and Chromatin Analysis Core (Core B) will provide services to Projects 1 and 2, in collaboration
with Core A, focusing on the role of alterations in transcriptional patterns induced by intravascular stress and
extravasation on extravascular survival, dormancy, and outgrowth. GCC will be responsible for analyzing
transcriptional and chromatin events that are affected by and may affect tumor cell vascular and transmigration
processes isolated in Projects 1 and 2. GCC will deploy state-of-the-art technologies, including single-cell mRNA
sequencing, genome mapping (e.g., Hi-C), and the nanoscale imaging of chromatin structural and molecular
states, and these results will be used for computational modeling of the mechanical properties and the signaling
pathways involved in mechano-adaptation and chromatin perturbation (Core A).
 In the bloodstream and during extravasation, tumor cells are exposed to a variety of physical stressors,
including mechanical damage due to shear stress and passage through narrow capillaries with substantial
nuclear deformations. It is not fully understood how mechanical stress and the resulting chromatin derangement
and transcriptional alterations affect the ability of tumor cells to form metastases, lead to aggressive disease,
develop dormancy, and foster their overall survival ability.
 Core B will provide genomic and chromatin analyses that will enable the Projects to begin addressing these
long-standing questions on the consequences of mechano-adaptation in metastasis. Core B will leverage single-
cell mRNA sequencing for transcription analysis as well as genome mapping (Hi-C, whenever possible, or Low-
input Hi-C) and a unique suite of nanoscale imaging technologies (3-D chromatin scanning transmission electron
tomography, optical single-molecule nanoscopy, and optical spectroscopic nanosensing) for chromatin
conformation analysis on cells generated by the model systems in the Projects. Furthermore, the data on
chromatin structure, including genome mapping and chromatin conformation imaging, will be provided to Core
A to enable the modeling of the mechanical and phenotypic properties of metastasizing tumor cells. Beyond the
scope of the U54 Center and upon completion of the Projects, the normalization of transcriptional reprogramming
might be explored for therapeutic targeting of metastasis."
10909901,"ABSTRACT. Two hallmarks of drug resistance in cancers are irregular metabolism and drug efflux. In multidrug-
resistant cancers, both of these processes disarm the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, ultimately resulting in de-
creased chemotherapeutic efficacy and increased mortality. Several strategies in development attempt to miti-
gate the effects of drug resistance by modulating specific metabolic pathways or disrupting drug efflux. Specifi-
cally, these strategies include inhibitors, interference RNAs, and nanomedicine approaches. However, a funda-
mental challenge to these strategies is the off-target toxicity that arises from disrupting metabolism or drug efflux
mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as these mechanisms are also critical to a number of healthy processes
throughout the body. To address this, our long-term objective is to develop a therapeutic strategy that exploits
both of these mechanisms of drug resistance in tandem to generate a therapeutic anti-cancer immune repsonse.
Our central hypothesis is that rationally designed prodrugs can co-opt cancer cell metabolism and drug efflux to
cause an anti-cancer immune response via a mechanism of action we have termed Bystander Assisted Immu-
noTherapy (BAIT). In BAIT, an enzyme-directed prodrug is first metabolized to an immunotherapeutic metabolite
by the irregular metabolism of multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Next, the immunotherapeutic is transported, via
P-gp-mediated drug efflux, to the extracellular space. This results in the activation of bystander immune cells in
local proximity, which initiate an anti-cancer immune response. Because BAIT requires tandem metabolism and
drug efflux, we anticipate a uniquely enhanced specificity for multidrug-resistant phenotypes that exhibit both of
these processes. To develop rationally designed BAIT prodrugs, we first identify small-molecule immunothera-
peutics that are susceptible to drug efflux. In concurrent studies, we also develop synthetic enzyme-directing
groups that modulate the activity of immunotherapeutics and are specifically removed by enzymes expressed in
the irregular metabolism of multidrug-resistant cancer cells. Combining these two research areas, we generate
enzyme-directed BAIT prodrugs that confer immunogenicity to multidrug-resistant cancers. In-vitro, this is con-
firmed in co-cultures of immune cells and cancer cell lines that express these metabolic enzymes and P-gp. In-
vivo, we use a murine model system for prostate cancer (TRAMP-C2 allograft) to demonstrate that BAIT pro-
drugs result in lowered toxicity, decreased tumor volume, and increased progression-free survival, relative to
conventional immunotherapeutics in immunocompetent mice. Taken together, we envision that this research will
establish BAIT as a therapeutic strategy that is enhanced, rather than disarmed, by drug resistance. It is our
long-term vision that this strategy could be widely applicable to multidrug-resistant cancers that evade the action
of conventional therapies through altered metabolisms and drug efflux."
10758207,"Project Summary
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain. A hallmark of both familial and sporadic PD is the presence of Lewy
body inclusions consisting of aggregated forms of the protein alpha-synuclein (a-syn), which is encoded by the
SNCA gene. Recent work by our lab has supported a large body of literature demonstrating that a-syn
accumulation disrupts protein homeostasis in neuronal models of PD. In neurons differentiated from induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients harboring mutations in SNCA, we observed impaired autophagic
clearance of misfolded proteins, ER morphology changes, and deficits in lysosomal hydrolase tracking. These
deficits in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) are intriguing given that GWAS studies have identified
variants in several genes encoding for ALP proteins that modify risk for developing PD. For instance, variants in
the gene GBA1, which encodes the lysosomal hydrolase β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the greatest genetic
risk factor for developing PD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Previous work from our lab has shown that
wild-type GCase accumulates in the ER of SNCA triplication mutation neurons, accompanied by dramatic ER
fragmentation. Yet, despite an increase in ER stress in these cells, the unfolded protein response (UPR) fails to
activate and either refold or degrade accumulating unstable ER proteins, including insoluble GCase. Intriguingly,
unbiased mass spectrometry revealed that several proteins involved in the selective autophagic degradation of
the ER, or ER-phagy, are significantly depleted in SNCA triplication neurons relative to isogenic controls,
suggesting that ER-phagy may be dysregulated in these cells. As ER-phagy plays an important role in ER protein
homeostasis and ER membrane remodeling, this hypothesis is consistent with the observations of ER-
fragmentation and insoluble protein accumulation observed in SNCA triplication neurons. While there is strong
genetic and pathological evidence implicating a-syn and the ALP in PD pathogenesis and a-syn-induced
disruptions to ER homeostasis and autophagy, relatively little is known about the role of ER-phagy in PD. Here,
we intend to resolve some key questions regarding a potential role of ER-phagy in PD pathogenesis. In Aim 1,
we will measure ER-phagy flux in SNCA triplication neurons and isogenic controls to determine whether a-syn
accumulation impairs ER-phagy and delineate the means through which this impairment may occur. In aim 2,
we will investigate the mechanism of wild-type GCase accumulation in the ER of SNCA triplication neurons, and
if enhancement of ER-phagy can restore ER homeostasis through alleviating accumulated GCase. As a-syn
accumulation is common across PD and DLB, and ER proteostasis defects are commonly observed across
neurodegenerative diseases, by resolving these questions, we hope to uncover insights that hold broad
therapeutic potential."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lewy body diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and multiple system
atrophy are characterized by the accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) protein, which is the
principal component of Lewy bodies (LBs). Neuroinflammation is the hallmark of Lewy body diseases and the
role of the immune system has been implicated in the progression of synuclein pathology and neuropathology.
However, the role of cellular immunity in promoting neurodegeneration or exerting neuroprotection remains
unclear. We established a preclinical mouse model of α-synucleinopathy and showed a robust increase in
immune responses in the CNS and the periphery. We noted significantly increased peripheral leukocytes
including natural killer (NK) cells in the mouse model of α-synucleinopathy. As innate immune cells, NK cells
are of particular interest for neurological disorders because they are modified in the periphery and/or travel into
the CNS. It has been shown that NK cell numbers are increased in the blood of PD patients compared to age-
matched controls and their activity is associated with disease severity. However, the role of NK cells in the
context of PD has never been explored. We recently reported NK cells are present in the substantia nigra of
post mortem brains of PD and LBD patients. Based on our experimental data, NK cells efficiently clear α-syn
aggregates and in vivo depletion of NK cells results in exacerbated synuclein pathology, neuroinflammation,
and striatal degeneration in a preclinical mouse model of α-syn aggregation. The proposed study will
investigate the mechanism (s) by which NK cells reduces α-syn burden, modulate inflammation, and exert
neuroprotection in the CNS and periphery. We will use both in vitro and in vivo mouse model of
synucleinopathies to address the physiological role of NK cells in the context of Lewy body diseases. To test
our central hypothesis and achieve our objective we propose three specific aims as follows: In Aim 1, we will
investigate the mechanism by which NK cells scavenge α-syn and modulate α-syn-induced inflammation and
neurotoxicity. In Aim 2, we will determine whether NK cells are neuroprotective in a mouse model of α-syn
aggregations. In Aim 3, we will determine if peripheral NK cell infiltration into the CNS is essential for
neuroprotection. To date, there are no therapies available to slow or stop disease progression of
synucleinopathies. Our study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of NK cells in the context
of Lewy body diseases. Therefore, this work can have a positive impact by providing a scientific basis for
pursuing NK cells as a potential immunotherapeutic target for aged-related neurodegenerative diseases.

10800677,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy in adults, and it is frequently refractory to current
anti-epileptic drugs, with treatments often exerting a variety of debilitating side effects. A major barrier for the
development of novel treatment strategies is our insufficient understanding of the precise cellular and circuit
mechanisms underlying TLE. A centrally important but unresolved question in TLE concerns the mechanisms
underlying the excessive, dysregulated production of action potentials at the axon initial segment (AIS) of
excitatory principal cells (PCs). Synaptic control of AIS is provided by a unique, evolutionarily conserved,
GABAergic cell-type, the axo-axonic cells (AACs). AACs form synaptic contacts exclusively with the AIS of
PCs, placing AACs in a strategic position to control action potential generation. However, due to technical
limitations, our knowledge about the in vivo function and regulation of AACs in the normal and epileptic
hippocampus has been extremely limited. Here we propose to employ a combination of recent technical
breakthroughs to test hypotheses about the in vivo functional effects, activity dynamics and efficacy of AAC-
mediated control of AIS in mouse models of chronic TLE. The planned project will also determine if it is
possible to mitigate epilepsy-related pathologically hyperactive circuits and cognitive deficits through
interventions selectively directed at the AAC-dependent, endogenous GABAergic processes regulating AIS in
chronic epilepsy. The proposed project aims to fill a major knowledge gap and address long-standing
controversies concerning the interneuronal regulation of AIS in epilepsy by leveraging expertise in novel large-
scale, high-resolution in vivo functional imaging techniques in combination with advanced electrophysiological,
behavioral, optogenetic and computational modeling techniques in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus.
It is anticipated that defining the function, regulation and therapeutic potential of AACs in TLE will have a
significant impact by advancing our understanding of key circuit control mechanisms in chronic epilepsy and
aid the future development of novel anti-epileptic treatment strategies."
10823302,"Medicare reimburses over 5 million biopsies resulting in 1.5 million surgical procedures annually for
nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Despite its burden on the health care system, treatment remains time-
consuming and unevenly available due to inefficient histologic methods used for diagnosis and to guide therapy.
As an alternative, two photon fluorescence microscopy (TPFM) combined with rapid molecular labeling
can evaluate histology dramatically faster than conventional methods. We have developed high speed TPFM
imaging for dermatologic surgery, protocols for rapid molecular labeling of human tissue, and conducted
preliminary studies showing that TPFM can evaluate skin cancer with similar accuracy to conventional
histology. Our approach addresses the limitations of current methods, which begin with diagnosis, where the
delay for histology means that patients must return for a second clinic visit if biopsies are positive. Inefficiencies
are compounded during therapy, where in standard excision the delay for processing means that histology is
evaluated postoperatively, and a second surgery may be required to complete therapy. Alternatively, in Mohs
surgery, intraoperative frozen sections may be used, resulting in a substantial increase in procedure time and
reduced clinic capacity. As a result, costs are increased and access to care is subject to regional variations, with
patients in rural areas more likely to receive substandard care that puts them at risk for disfigurement or tumor
recurrence. The goal of this research program is to advance two photon imaging technology for surgical
applications, and then conduct clinical trials testing the use of TPFM in both diagnostic biopsy
procedures and in surgical treatment of NMSC. The aims for this proposal are: Aim 1 will develop improved
TPFM that incorporates recent advances in detector and laser technology to reduce cost, shrink size, and
enhance contrast, providing an efficient new tool for diagnosing and treating NMSC. Concurrently, studies will
examine the accuracy of TPFM for a less common type of skin cancer. Aim 2 will study patients undergoing
dermatologic biopsy, testing the hypothesis that patients can be immediately diagnosed using TPFM, enabling
same visit treatment for common skin cancers. Finally, Aim 3 proposes interventional surgical trials. Aim 3, Task
1 will integrate TPFM into Mohs surgery, testing the hypothesis that faster histological imaging can accelerate
treatment. Aim 3, Task 2 will introduce TPFM for margin evaluation into standard (non-Mohs) excision of skin
cancer, testing the hypothesis that TPFM can be used in a scenario for which no intraoperative imaging is
currently practical. Collectively, these aims will test more efficient methods of diagnosing and excising skin
cancer, accelerating treatment, reducing costs and morbidity while expanding access to care. Successful
completion of this project would demonstrate powerful new tools for general surgical pathology and validate
them for use in dermatologic surgery."

10820526,"Project Summary – Precision Nutrition Core
The Precision Nutrition Core was established in 2016 as a pilot core, offering nutrigenomics services only.
While the role of genetics in precision nutrition has been widely accepted, the field has only begun to reach its
potential, and relatively few examples of nutrient-gene interactions have reached consensus. Furthermore, the
translation of these findings has not been fulfilled, and continued robust investigations, conducted by
researchers with necessary expertise, are needed. A central tenet in the design of the Core is that we can best
meet the demands of UNC NORC members by working closely with substantive experts to expand their
research into studies of variability in nutritional response. Since its inception, the Core’s user base has
increased consistently, from 18 users in 2016 to 42 users in 2019, as have user inquiries regarding services
related to other aspects of precision nutrition—in particular, the gut microbiome. As such, the Core recruited
Dr. Carroll to implement and oversee nutrition- and obesity-focused microbiome services, a previously unmet
need at UNC. The gut microbiome is intimately connected to metabolic heterogeneity through its effects on
energy harvest, metabolic signaling, and the production of metabolites of dietary components. This Core is one
of only two cores across the national NORC system to provide nutrigenomics services. The goal of the
Precision Nutrition Core is to provide a suite of precision nutrition services that enable investigators to integrate
nutrigenomics and microbiome analysis into nutrition and obesity research to advance our understanding of
how individual genetics and gut microbial communities influence individual variability related to nutritional
exposures and adiposity. The Core provides expertise and services in two areas: 1) Nutrigenomics and 2)
Microbiome Analysis. The Core offers laboratory services for assessing individual variation – including DNA
and RNA extraction from blood, saliva, and fecal samples and caloric content determination of fecal samples
and fecal metabolite assessment – as well as customized, cutting-edge research tools – including whole
genome, exome, and targeted gene sequencing; RNA-sequencing; microbiota characterization, including 16S
rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics; targeted genotyping using PCR-based assays; array-
based gene expression profiling; and bisulfide sequencing for methylation patterns in humans and mouse
models. Leveraging the resources available at the UNC NORC, the Core fills a critical gap in nutrition and
obesity research at UNC by providing investigators with the expertise and resources to investigate the role of
host genetic and gut microbiome factors in biological responses to nutritional exposure. This Core is located at
both the Chapel Hill and the UNC Nutrition Research Institute campuses to serve investigators at both
locations."
10820530,"Project Summary – Pilot and Feasibility Program
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC) at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) provides seed research support primarily for junior investigators in nutrition
and obesity research during their critical transition years as new faculty members. The Program also provides
seed research support to select established investigators whose previous expertise and research lie outside
the UNC NORC research focus on nutrition and obesity, but whose proposals are sufficiently exciting and
innovative to warrant UNC NORC support. Beyond the simple provision of research funding, the P&F program
offers careful mentoring, supportive role models, and rigorous and consistent critiques of research projects.
This comprehensive approach has resulted a high return on investment in terms of federal- and non-federal
external grant funding, high-impact publications, presentations, and career advancement. Promoting diversity
among researchers in the field of nutrition and obesity is a critical need and particularly relevant given the high
rates of nutrition-related chronic disease in minority populations. 19% of previous P&F awardees are members
of underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) groups and we aim to increase that percentage to at least
50% for the upcoming five years. Since the inception of our P&F Program in 1999, the UNC NORC has
awarded $2,737,229 to 68 unique investigators to support new and innovative research in nutrition and obesity.
To date, P&F awardees have received $51,004,276 in external research support based on pilot data generated
as part of their P&F projects. Most of this funding ($47,256,242) has been from the National Institutes of
Health. The P&F Program continues to develop its research partnerships with nutrition and obesity research
faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities as part of the Program’s effort to promote the career
development of underrepresented minority investigators."
10974461,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in females. Triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and lethal subtype of breast cancer with limited treatment options.
A significant portion of TNBCs harbor hyperactivation of transcription factor MYC, which drives gene
dysregulation and promote the elevated growth and proliferation of TNBCs. On the other hand, it has also been
shown that transcriptional amplification in cancers, including those driven by MYC hyperactivation, places
specific burdens on molecular machines involved in RNA metabolism. As one of such examples, we have shown
that inhibiting molecules involved in RNA splicing can lead to significant cell stress and death of MYC+ TNBCs.
However, while groundbreaking research has focused on dysregulation of RNA synthesis and processing in
cancer, far less is known about how oncogenes such as MYC deregulate RNA decay pathways to drive aberrant
gene regulation. Exoribonuclease-mediated RNA decay is a critical component of RNA metabolism. Although
defects in exoribonucleases present in various disease settings have been linked to the cellular accumulation of
misprocessed RNA transcripts, such relevance in cancer is far from understood. Through a prior genome-wide
forward genetic screen, we identified that silencing of mitochondrial 3’ to 5’ exoribonuclease PNPT1 is lethal
specifically in the context of MYC hyperactivation. Subsequent analysis of Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap)
database further revealed that the function of PNPT1 is critical across models of TNBCs. Recent evidence
demonstrated that defects in PNPT1 can lead to the accumulation of intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
and the induction of dsRNA-mediated antiviral-like immune and apoptotic responses in cancer cells. Similarly,
we have confirmed that silencing of PNPT1 in SUM159, a MYC-dependent human TNBC line, also leads to the
accumulation of intracellular dsRNA. These preliminary findings lead us to hypothesize that PNPT1 plays a
critical role in the removal of aberrant RNA transcripts and prevents the induction of dsRNA-mediated cell
stresses, thereby conferring survival benefits to TNBCs. Herein, we propose to leverage cutting-edge chemical-
genetic (PROTAC) tools, RNA sequencing, and proteomic analysis approaches to elucidate the role of PNPT1
in TNBC survival and progression. We will 1) Assess the effects of PNPT1 perturbation on induction of dsRNA-
mediated antiviral responses in TNBCs; 2) Examine the effects of PNPT1 perturbation on overall RNA
metabolism in TNBCs; and 3) Determine the effects of PNPT1 perturbation on TNBC survival and progression.
Successful completion of the proposed project will provide novel insights into how PNPT1-mediated RNA decay
helps sustain TNBC growth and survival. Further, the study will serve as a foundation for the development of
novel therapeutic approaches targeting PNPT1 for the potential treatment of TNBCs. Additionally, the study will
support the evaluation of other exoribonucleases and RNA decay pathways as potential vulnerabilities of TNBCs
and other cancers harboring dysregulated RNA metabolism."
10874379,"Project Summary:
 A number of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome exhibit characteristic motor-related symptoms such as
repetitive or impulsive action patterns. It is possible that these behaviors are a result of dysregulated action
control mechanisms mediated via cortico-basal-thalamic pathway disruption. However, it is not currently
understood how alterations in these circuits give rise to the deficits in action control commonly observed in these
disorders. Copy number variation of genes encoding for synaptic adhesion molecules, such as Neurexin1α
(Νrxn1α), have been shown to confer a significantly increased risk for these disorders, however, the underlying
neural etiopathology is currently unknown. Recent findings in acute striatal slices have revealed that loss of
Νrxn1α function results in decreased synaptic strength of medial prefrontal cortical inputs to the indirect pathway
of the dorsal striatum, providing a potential neural mechanism for irregular action control. However, it is unclear
whether these synaptic deficits confer variations to larger scale neural dynamics related to action control
dysfunction in vivo. I hypothesize that these Νrxn1α mutations drive action control deficits (Aim 1) via
mutation-associated corticostriatal circuit alterations specific to the indirect pathway (Aim 2) in Nrxn1a
KO mice. To assay multiple key aspects of action control, I will employ a novel treadmill-based operant task that
allows for the comprehensive study of action initiation, suppression, and modulation. Using dual-site in vivo
electrophysiological techniques, I plan to describe the underlying corticostriatal population recruitment related to
task performance in two fronto-striatal circuits (mPFC→DMS and M2→DLS) in both Νrxn1α WT and Νrxn1α KO
mice. These findings will provide valuable insight into the neural pathology involved in many neuropsychiatric
and neurodevelopmental disorders as well as elucidate corticostriatal neural mechanisms involved in action
control regulation."
10833046,"Project Summary
The human centromere contains non-coding repetitive alpha-satellite DNA sequences that is under
active RNA polymerase (RNAP) II-catalyzed transcription. The centromeric transcription has been
proposed to play an important role in the deposition of centromere proteins to centromeric chromatin
and centromeric cohesion. However, these conclusions are facing a challenge because the approaches
to suppress centromeric transcription in these studies were not specific to centromeres. Therefore, it is
critically important to develop novel approaches to specifically inactivate centromeric transcription
without significantly altering global gene transcription and then determine the functions of centromeric
transcription. In addition, how centromeric transcription is regulated is also poorly understood. The
overall objective of this application is to determine the functioning mechanisms underlying centromeric
transcription. Based on the published and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that centromeric
transcription orchestrated by specific factors and histone modifications during the cell cycle promotes
centromeric cohesion that is essential for chromosome segregation. This hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) determining the functions of centromeric transcription. We will examine
centromeric cohesion when centromeric transcription is specifically suppressed using our newly
developed approach. 2) elucidating the epigenetic regulation of centromeric transcription. We will test
the role of the histone mark H3K4 di-methylation (me2) in centromeric transcription and its regulation.
3) identifying the key regulators for centromeric transcription. We will test the functioning mechanism of
Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)11 in centromeric transcription. At the completion of the proposed
research, we will expect to have determined the functioning mechanisms of centromeric transcription.
These results will have an important positive impact because they will contribute to a conceptual
framework for the future identification and development for potential cancer therapeutic targets."

Candidate: Dr. Marissa Hauptman is an Instructor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School (HMS), a
pediatrician and environmental medical toxicologist, and Assistant Director of the Pediatric Environmental
Health Center at Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH). At BCH, she completed her pediatrics residency and a joint
pediatric environmental medicine and health services research fellowship. Building on her early work, her
proposed career development plan focuses on 2 areas of career development—geospatial and biomarker
environmental exposure science, clinical biomedical informatics—that will add to her research toolkit, increase
the rigor of her work, and enhance her ability to develop, evaluate, and integrate environmental exposure
science and epidemiology into clinical medicine. She will gain these skills through coursework, experiential
learning, mentorship, and participation in seminars and national and international meetings. Environment: Dr.
Hauptman is supported by extensive research, professional, and academic resources at BCH, HMS, and
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, including the BCH Institutional Centers for Clinical and
Translational Research, Harvard-Chan NIEHS Center on Environmental Health, and the Harvard Catalyst
Program. Her committed team of mentors and advisors include national experts in geospatial, air pollution and
biomarker environmental exposure science and epidemiology, biostatistics/bioinformatics and clinical
prediction methodology. Research: Despite increasing evidence of its adverse effects, air pollution has not
been effectively addressed by healthcare providers in clinical medicine. Further knowledge is clearly needed,
as elucidating robust environmental air pollutant biomarkers and readily available geospatial data as well as
underlying mechanisms may lead to new therapeutic options and strategies for clinicians to better address a
patient’s environment at the bedside. Dr. Hauptman proposes to build on prior work to rigorously evaluate and
develop—through geospatial and biomarker environmental exposure science, epidemiology, and biomedical
informatics—a feasible innovative Asthma Integrated Risk (AIR) Clinical Prediction model that relies on readily
available data through patient report, the electronic medical record system, public available data sources and
biomarkers that can assist clinicians in predicting high risk pediatric patients with asthma and potentially
tailoring environmental and therapeutic interventions. At the end of this project, Dr. Hauptman will be well-
positioned to apply for an R01 to further test whether implementation of this clinical decision support
intervention improves asthma morbidity by more comprehensively identifying and addressing environmental air
pollutants in children with chronic health conditions. The successful completion of this project will position Dr.
Hauptman for the next stage of her career as an independent investigator addressing environmental exposures
in clinical medicine."

10832481,"The mechanisms by which mucosal responses to the microbiota in the presence of specific pathogenic bacterial
species (e.g. P. gingivalis-Pg), could abrogate the host-microbe symbiotic relationship leading to dysbiosis and
inflammatory disease remain not fully understood. Our pioneering R21 studies demonstrated that Pg-induced
phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2-IIA), in a mechanism that involves activation of Notch-1 receptor (N1R) by
Pg gingipains, modulates the antimicrobial properties of oral epithelial cells (OECs). This is consistent with in
vivo and clinical evidence supporting the potent (ng/mL) antimicrobial effects of PLA2-IIA. Noteworthy, oral
bacterial species exhibited differential antimicrobial susceptibility to PLA2-IIA. Moreover, gingival PLA2-IIA
expression and N1R activation were elevated during initiation and progression of periodontal disease, which was
concurrent with oral dysbiosis in non-human primates. In agreement with these observations, new preliminary
studies using mice models demonstrated increased gingival PLA2-IIA expression and N1R activation early after
Pg infection. Remarkably, the oral microbiome of transgenic mice overexpressing PLA2-IIA (PLA2-IIA-Tg)
exhibited significant differences in the abundance of bacterial species (decreased Firmicutes and increased
Proteobacteria) compared to their wild type co-caged littermates. Oral dysbiosis in PLA2-IIA-Tg mice was
associated with changes in the gingival expression of genes involved in intracellular sensing (NOD2), classical
antimicrobial factors (S100a8/S100a9, hBD1), and M1/M2 macrophage chemokines. N1R is a critical modulator
of mucosal immunity; therefore, the ability of Pg to activate N1R in OECs is an exciting and innovative
observation. Preliminary data suggested that other OEC functions/responses (bacterial sensing, apoptosis, and
autophagy) could involve Pg-induced N1R activation. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that activation of
Notch-1/PLA2-IIA pathway in gingival epithelial surfaces would be an innovative and plausible mechanism by
which pathogens such as Pg could specifically enhance oral dysbiosis, inflammation and periodontal disease. To
test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: (i) To determine the role of PLA2-IIA in Pg-induced
oral dysbiosis, inflammation and periodontal disease, (ii) To determine the role of epithelial
Notch-1 in Pg-induced PLA2-IIA and periodontitis, and (iii) To identify and validate oral
epithelial innate responses modulated by Pg through Notch-1 activation. To address these
knowledge gaps, we will use the Pg-induced periodontitis oral gavage model in mouse strains with or without a
natural PLA2-IIA mutation, PLA2-IIA-Tg mice with their WT littermates, epithelial-specific N1R deficient mice,
as well as OEC cultures to validate the role of this pathway in Pg-induced oral dysbiosis and periodontal disease.
These findings will enable a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are specifically
modulated by pathogens to alter microbial communities at mucosal surfaces as well as contribute to the evidence
for future research designed to determine the role of N1R in oral health and other diseases (e.g., oral cancer)."

As HIV care and treatment programs are implemented throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
critical advances in research and policy are needed so that care and treatment resources can
be deployed to optimal benefit: decreasing new HIV transmissions, HIV-related morbidity and
mortality, and illness from non-communicable disease (NCD). Coverage of antiretroviral therapy
in the 'Treat All' era varies widely in our region, from 87% in Rwanda to 25% in Republic of
Congo, the lowest coverage among all IeDEA countries in SSA. Our research agenda is
designed to generate actionable knowledge to help close these gaps. Our regional cohort
database includes longitudinal data for 81,183 adults and 11,789 children ever enrolling in HIV
care at 22 sites in Burundi, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo
and Rwanda. We propose to supplement this database with linked cohorts to address a range
of investigations relevant to our region including: 1) leveraging implementation science
approaches to inform strategies aimed at improving HIV prevention, care and treatment
outcomes in the region (Aim 1); 2) conducting in-depth clinical investigations of HIV-related
outcomes and infectious (e.g. TB) and non-infectious (e.g. NCDs) comorbidities (Aim 2); 3)
leading and supporting an innovative multiregional scientific agenda within the larger IeDEA

10617767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Controversies exist regarding the contribution of glial cell dysregulation and inflammation to the pathogenesis
of Parkinson Disease (PD). Signs of inflammation have been detected in postmortem tissue of PD patients, and
recent evidence suggests that mutations in genes associated with familial PD can influence the function of
astrocytes and microglia. These findings, together with the existence of mutations in the HLA locus in PD
patients, have led investigators to propose an etiological role for inflammation and glial dysfunction in PD.
However, direct evidence is lacking for mechanistic links among inflammation, glial dysregulation, and the
neuronal loss characteristic of PD.
 To identify potential cell-autonomous mediators of PD-relevant processes in glia, we used a bioinformatics
strategy to identify PD GWAS genes enriched in glial cells of the mouse brain. Interestingly, a small subset of
genes exhibits enrichment of expression in astrocytes. PD-linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms in one of
these genes, CD38, are associated with a ~45% reduction in CD38 transcript expression in the human brain.
Previous work has demonstrated a role for CD38 in peripheral immune cells, where it serves to regulate REDOX
balance in both intra- and extra-cellular compartments; the roles for CD38 in the brain have only recently been
explored. Preliminary experiments from our laboratory have shown that CD38 expression is enriched in
astrocytes of the human and mouse brain, NAD/NAM balance is disrupted in various regions of the CD38
knockout mouse brain, and inflammation and CD38 deficiency synergistically interact to influence motor function.
Here, we propose to use CD38 as a prototypical gene to understand ways in which glial dysfunction can give
rise to a PD-like phenotype in mice by investigating 1) the requirement for CD38 in the maintenance of REDOX
homeostasis and dopaminergic neuron function and viability in aging mice, 2) the role for CD38 in the regulation
of inflammation in the substantia nigra, and 3) the impact of CD38 modulation on the vulnerability of dopaminergic
neurons in two synucleinopathy mouse models of PD. A subset of experiments will test the involvement of
REDOX dysregulation in the changes observed in CD38-deficient mice by determining whether provision of
nicotinamide riboside, a bioavailable NAD precursor, can prevent dopaminergic oxidative stress, cell dysfunction,
and loss. Altogether, these experiments have the potential to reveal mechanistic contributors to increased
neuronal vulnerability with glial dysfunction and provide novel information about the roles for glia in maintaining
dopaminergic neuron survival in aging and disease."

 During embryonic development and lineage specification, a complex set of extracellular signals is integrated
on chromatin by Master Transcription Factors (TF) that modify chromatin structure and gene expression. PRDM
proteins are TFs, containing a PR-methyltransferase domain at their N-terminus and DNA-binding Zn-fingers at
their C-terminus. All 17 PRDM family members are well known for their role as master regulator of lineage
specification and their deregulated expression is often linked to diseases.
 Our group has characterized the function of PRDM10, a transcriptional activator, orchestrating mouse
preimplantation development. Our preliminary data indicate that: 1) Prdm10 zygotic KO embryos have visible
defects at embryonic day E3.5; 2) Prdm10 maternal (Zona Pellucida3 (Zp3)-CRE) KO embryos arrest at the
zygote/two-cell stage; 3) PRDM10 is unique among PRDM family members, as it contains a Glutamine-rich
coactivator domain at its C-terminus. Based on this preliminary data we propose the following experiments:
 In Aim1 we will determine the function of maternal PRDM10. We will take advantage of the Zp3-CRE
strain, to delete Prdm10 in the oocyte, and deplete the PRDM10 maternal protein contribution in the zygote. This
will allow us to study the function of PRDM10 before zygotic transcriptional activation and determine the gene
network directly regulated by PRDM10.
 In Aim2 we will determine the mechanism of action of PRDM10 as a transcription factor. In this aim we
will characterize the mode of action of PRDM10 (i.e. its methyltransferase activity, its protein interactome, and
its transcriptional activation and DNA binding-properties). We will also specifically address PRDM10’s function
in dictating the choice of alternative promoter usage. Finally, we will validate the function in oocyte and early
embryogenesis of key PRDM10-downstream effectors.
 The significance of these studies is that Prdm10 is an uncharacterized maternal effect gene, and knowledge
of the pathways regulated by this Zn-finger TF will be useful to the field of stem cell biology and reproductive
medicine."
10814350,"Severe Early Childhood Caries (S-ECC) is difficult to treat effectively and has an alarming and distressing
tendency to recur following treatment. S-ECC is a particularly acute form of early childhood caries (ECC) that is
characterized by an overwhelming caries-promoting microbial challenge, including Mutans Streptococci (MS)
and Lactobacilli (LB). The standard of care for ECC/S-ECC revolves around treatment in a surgical operating
suite under general anesthesia, followed by application of 5% topical fluoride varnish, family counseling
regarding feeding behaviors and oral hygiene instruction. Clinical studies demonstrate approximately 40% of
children treated for S-ECC will develop new caries lesions within 12 months after dental surgery. Reducing
cariogenic oral microbiota with a topical anti-microbial agent is a potential approach to reduction of recurrent
disease in young children with S-ECC. Recent studies have shown that 10% povidone iodine
(polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine, 10% PVPI) appears promising in preventing dental caries in young children. A meta-
analysis of antimicrobial interventions and the oral microbiota associated with ECC highlight the paucity of high-
quality randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of antimicrobial agents, including PVPI. The data from the
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES 2011-2014) indicates that the prevalence of ECC
in US preschool children is 24% and ranges between 11% and 72%. The clinical, social and public health impact
of ECC/S-ECC is underscored by its association with increased risk of new caries lesions in the primary dentition,
a higher risk of caries onset in the permanent dentition, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, high treatment
costs, lost school days, diminished ability to learn and a profound impact on a child’s quality of life. The primary
objective of this UG3/UH3 application is to assess the efficacy of 10% PVPI in children with S-ECC to
prevent, in part or in whole, new cavitated caries lesions that require surgical intervention after oral
rehabilitation. The Specific Aims are: 1 (UG3): to finalize the study protocol, develop the Manual of Procedures
(MOP), finalize quality management and data management plans, finalize study case report forms (CRFs) and
set-up data management system; 2 (UH3): to conduct a single center randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled Phase II trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of topical 10% PVPI to prevent new cavitated caries lesions
when applied to the teeth of children with S-ECC following oral rehabilitation; 3 (UH3): to measure severity and
incidence of new dental caries in children with S-ECC following oral rehabilitation who are receiving quarterly
topical 10% PVPI; 4 (UH3): to assess the effect of topical 10% PVPI on diversity and composition of oral
microbiota, including cariogenic MS, LB and Candida species to better understand the mechanism of action of
10% PVPI on the oral microbiome. The primary outcome will be time from randomization until cavitated carious
lesion (ICDAS code 3) is first detected post-surgery. Caries increment will be measured with the International
Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). The approved FDA IND for this trial is #108961."
10846750,"Project Abstract/Summary
My research focuses on the precise understanding of the regulation of RNA in living cells and human diseases.
Mapping where the regulations take place is critical in identifying factors and elements that alter RNA
expression. Further enhancing the genomic resolution and the spatiotemporal resolution of RNA expression
have been a strong driver of leading discoveries in molecular and disease mechanisms.
 My first focus is to define the high-resolution maps of the transcriptional enhancers in peripheral blood
immune cells, using enhancer RNA (eRNA) as the guide. eRNA transcription is a novel mechanism of which
the RNA is synthesized from enhancer sequences themselves other than their target genes. eRNA has
expanded the previous understanding of how enhancers are constructed and allowed mapping important
subregions within the enhancers in higher resolution. eRNA based maps of enhancers will guide us to more
efficiently discover genomic elements linked to the dysregulation of disease genes, and specifically dissect
causal genetic variations or mutations. This will have a widespread impact on major human diseases, and my
specific focus is on immunometabolic diseases and the impact of enhancer variations at the eRNA start sites.
 The second focus is on the subcellular compartments that leads to differential RNA trafficking, processing,
and decay. Membraneless organelles, such as stress granules, are suggested to be the novel mechanism of
gene expression control through phase separation and sequestration. I will explore the idea that spatial
compartmentalization confers specificity of temporal gene expression. In particular, I will dissect the specificity
of RNA processing in stress granules in high temporal resolution in immune cell activation and exhaustion and
explore their linkage to the dysregulation of disease associated genes. This will lead to the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets on the specificity factors during the phase separation process.
 To address these, my group harnesses the power of high throughput RNA sequencing methods, and
further tailor them. We developed novel RNA sequencing methods such as Precision Run-On sequencing,
Chromatin Run-On sequencing, Tail End Displacement sequencing, and RNA granule sequencing. These
methods elucidate multiple aspects of RNA mechanism in high throughput: nascent transcription, poly(A) tail
modification, and RNA sequestration. We will continue to improve and develop novel RNA analysis strategies
to dissect eRNA transcription, RNA modifications, and combining these methods with subcellular
compartmentalization in high spatial and temporal resolution in cost efficient manners. These innovations will
lead to enhancements in refining genetic maps and higher spatiotemporal resolution in analyzing RNA
expression. Our mission is to discover critical mechanisms and checkpoints of RNA lifespan, focusing on
eRNA and RNA granules. This will provide foundations to apply the ideas and methods of high-resolution RNA
mapping in further collaborative efforts for advancing the precision medicine of human disease."
10795010,"Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 30 million Americans leading to estimated annual health care costs
of $40 billion. Moreover, there are few therapies for CKD and only palliative treatments for patients with End
Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), namely dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, there is large unmet need
to train the next generation of kidney-based researchers to develop new and effective treatments and cures for
the myriad of kidney diseases. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine has many investigators across
multiple departments with NIH funded track records of kidney-based research ranging from laboratory based to
patient oriented research. These same investigators have strong track records of mentoring. We are requesting
funds to provide room, board and a stipend to bright undergraduates that will work with mentors on kidney-based
research. This program will allow students to perform research for a 10-week period over the summer as part of
the Summer Research Internship Program kidney workshop (SRIP-Kid). The pool of diverse undergraduates will
come from a wide range of Universities around the country. This program will be administered by the Division of
Pediatric Nephrology and will include faculty from the Pediatric Nephrology Division, Adult Renal-Electrolyte
Division, and Critical Care Nephrology Department. The major goals of this program will be achieved by providing
novel didactics on renal topics and career advice to participants. Select members of the training faculty will meet
weekly with all students to provide a one-hour didactic session on a renal topic followed by a 30-minute
discussion on a pertinent paper and a discussion about career options as a nephrology researcher. Furthermore,
we will provide research training under the mentorship of world-class kidney researchers. A multimedia platform
has been developed specifically for this program and will act as an interface for future, current and past students.
SRIP-Kid students will be matched with one of the training faculty to pursue a research project. Given the breadth
of the training faculty research interests, students will have the opportunity to work on a laboratory-based project
or a patient oriented research project. At the end of the 10 weeks, the students will present their work as an oral
presentation. Upon completion of this summer program the students will have had exposure to a wide array of
kidney-based research topics, to nationally respected clinician-scientists and PhD scientists, and to a specific
kidney-based research project. Given that decisions about a specialty in medicine and/or research focus often
happen in early stages of training, the intent of this program is to increase the number of trainees that will
eventually become clinician-scientists or PhD scientists in nephrology. We will monitor the student’s future career
decisions through social media platforms related to this summer program."
10795069,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Social disconnection (SDC) and suicide deaths are major public health concerns for
the aging population. SDC is one of the strongest risk factors of suicidal ideation, attempts, and deaths in older
adults, and is a modifiable target for suicide prevention efforts in this population. While accumulating evidence
has established an association between SDC and late-life suicide risk, the neural mechanisms that underlie
this association remain unknown. Consequently, our understanding of how to optimally intervene to mitigate
the adverse effects of SDC on suicide risk in older adults is limited. To address this gap, we propose to
conduct the first in vivo molecular imaging study of a potential neural mechanism – corticolimbic synaptic
density – that may mediate the link between SDC and late-life suicide risk. Given a higher prevalence of
suicide death in older men than women, we will also examine whether sex moderates this association.
Converging evidence from human magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem studies and preclinical work
suggests brain alterations in SDC and suicidality, with robust evidence implicating lower corticolimbic synaptic
density. In animal models of SDC, socialization appears to reverse some of these synaptic losses. These
studies have also observed sex differences in synaptic changes in interventions designed to reverse SDC-
related synaptic losses. Thus, it is critical to conduct in vivo human studies to evaluate molecular mechanisms
that may confer risk for suicide in older adults with SDC in order to identify who is at greatest risk and how to
mitigate burden of suicide to older adults, their families, and the community at large. In vivo quantification of
synaptic density in humans is possible with the radioligand 11C-UCB-J, which quantifies the density of synaptic
vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a ubiquitously expressed marker of synaptic density, using positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging. Our preliminary data from a diverse sample of older adults confirm preclinical
findings of lower corticolimbic synaptic density in SDC and suggest sex-specific differences. In the proposed
study, we will recruit a transdiagnostic cohort of older adults presenting with the full range of SDC and evaluate
whether lower corticolimbic synaptic density mediates the relation between SDC and longitudinal trajectories of
late-life suicide risk in a sex-specific manner. We will employ a novel, data-driven approach to model
predominant trajectories of late-life suicide risk, which will include measures of suicide
depressive
and death ideation,
symptoms, loss of personal and self-worth, executive control, and perceived meaning in life.
Results of the proposed study will provide the first human in vivo data on the role of synaptic density alterations
as a putative neural mechanism linking SDC to late-life suicide risk. They will also inform the development and
testing of targeted interventions to enhance synaptogenesis (e.g., medications such as ketamine or
psychosocial interventions such as peer support), as well as public policies to promote social connection
among older adults who may suffer from illness or other issues that lead to SDC."
10755727,"Cancer immunotherapy (IMT) can produce robust and durable anti-tumor immune responses in some cases.
However, many cancers are non-responsive to IMT and combination approaches need to be actively
investigated, particularly in lethal tumors such as IMT-insensitive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preclinical
studies in general have been found to be poor predictors of success for IMT agents and chemoradiotherapy
combinations in the clinic, likely due to poorly conceived and executed treatment protocols, dated disease model
systems and lack of an existing framework for cross-validation of preclinical results. There is a need to develop
a rigorous preclinical testing program for existing IMT agents combined with chemoradiation. NSCLC genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of the major molecular NSCLC subtypes have been created. However,
there are no NSCLC GEMMs that to our knowledge has demonstrated “abscopal” responses reliably to IMT,
which is one unique strength of this current proposal. Also, a major limitation of existing GEMMs is the relatively
small number of different genotypes that can be generated and their lack of quantitative precision. This proposal
leverages a new technique, tumor barcoding with barcode deep-sequencing (Tuba-seq) and in vivo Cre-lox and
CRISPR/Cre-mediated GEMMs to model oncogenesis and radiation-drug response with unprecedented
precision and genomic-comprehensiveness. We are using this R01 mechanism in the present proposal via two
Specific Aims stated below to test the following central hypotheses: (i) we hypothesize that treating with both
anti-PD-L1 and a novel orally bioavailable ATR inhibitor (ATRi), AZD6738, in combination with chemoradiation
will result in an improved and durable anti-tumor immune response in poorly immunogenic NSCLC GEMMs; and,
(ii) Tuba-seq we will allow an unprecedented view of the radio-pharmacogenetic landscape of NSCLC responses
in vivo. SPECIFIC AIM #1 – Establish a radio-pharmacogenetic map of oncogene-driven non-small cell lung
cancer to both chemoradiation and combined chemoradiation/anti-PD-L1 therapy We propose to use novel
CRISPR/Cre-mediated GEMMs of NSCLC to test the optimal combinations of chemoradiation with anti-PD-L1
IMT. We will then examine the mechanism of action of chemoradiation with IMT using multiparametric
immunologic approaches and an innovative technique enabling lineage tracing and direct quantification of
treatment effects on these different genetic backgrounds in vivo. SPECIFIC AIM #2 – Determine tumor cell
genotype effects on combination anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy and ATRi with chemoradiotherapy in oncogene-
driven non-small cell lung cancer. This Aim leverages our novel CRISPR/Cre-mediated GEMMs of NSCLC to
test genotype effects on the combination of anti-PD-L1 and ATRi with chemoradiation. By using all these tools,
we will be able to decode the major aspects of the molecular underpinnings of chemoradiation and combination
IMT resistance in NSCLC, contributing to improved therapies and positively impacting patient outcomes."
10749069,"Development of a dual-iDDS probe multiplex test for detecting endemic fungal agents Confidential PI: Shafer, David A., PhD
PROJECT SUMMARY
In this study, we propose developing a simple, lyophilized molecular test for detecting the causative agents of
Valley fever (coccidioidomycosis), histoplasmosis, or blastomycosis, based on our proprietary internal DNA-
Detection Switch (iDDS) probe technology. Timely diagnosis of these fungal infections is key for selecting
effective treatments and preventing severe morbidity or death. Over 500,000 such cases are thought to occur in
the US annually, although only one FDA-approved molecular test exists for diagnosing Valley fever, and no FDA-
approved molecular tests exist for diagnosing histoplasmosis or blastomycosis.
The symptoms of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis are frequently vague and chest X-rays
do not distinguish between these and other lung diseases. Thus, differential diagnosis between these diseases
and other that present with similar symptoms (acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung cancer, lymphoma,
pericarditis, sarcoidosis, or solitary pulmonary nodules) is key for proactive healthcare interventions. Moreover,
diagnosis using culture- or serology-based methods may have a turnaround time of weeks or months, or show
false-positive results, and the only related FDA-approved test (the GeneSTAT.MDx Coccidioides Assay) is only
approved for use on the manufacturer’s instrument, which dissuades from use at reference labs.
GeneTAG Technology (www.genetagtech.com) specializes in developing sensitive and reliable qPCR probe
systems. Our error-resistant iDDS probe system employs a fluorescently labeled target specific probe and a
slightly mismatched quencher-labeled antiprobe. In the absence of the intended target, the antiprobe hybridizes
to the probe, quenching its fluorescence and preventing off-target detection. We have also developed dual-iDDS
probe assays for increased specificity and automatic confirmation of the test results. This added layer of
specificity is key for accurate diagnosis, especially with low levels of fungal infection. Redundant detection at
multiple target sites greatly reduces the need for reflex/confirmatory testing. Our Specific Aims are (1) to develop
a 3-tube dual-iDDS probe assay for C. immitis, C. posadasii, H. capsulatum, and B. dermatitidis, and (2) to
evaluate key performance characteristics of the multiplex test for endemic fungal agents in lyophilized format.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will (i) develop locked nucleic acid (LNA)-enhanced dual-iDDS probes for diagnostic
sequence-specific targets in each pathogen, (ii) convert the dual-iDDS probes to lyophilized format, and (iii)
conduct cross-reactivity testing with the lyophilized assays to assess false-positive detection of other pathogens
commonly found in bronchoalveolar fluid. In Aim 2, we will determine the (i) linearity, (ii) limit of detection (LoD),
(iii) precision, (iv) effects of interfering substances (if any), and (v) stability of the dual-iDDS probe assays.
Success in this endeavor will justify expanded testing with clinical specimens in Phase II through a BSL III-
certified contract research organization."
10772001,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In nature, we observe an abundance of both phenotypic and genetic variation. Phenotypic variation is
understood to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the genetic component is
considered the primary tractable part of the system, and much of the remaining phenotypic variation is left
unexplained. In addition, a major problem in population genetics is that much genetic variation in not explained
by evolutionary forces of mutation, selection, and drift alone, including genetic variants that may be deleterious.
This unexplained abundance of both phenotypic and genetic variation reveals a major gap in our
understanding of how life works. Further, it has major implications for our understanding of the development of
complex diseases, which may appear to develop randomly because of our limited understanding of factors
influencing them. I therefore propose investigating differences in epigenetic regulation (‘epigenetic variation’)
as a unifying causal factor to account for unexplained phenotypic and genetic variation. I propose a set of
empirical and theoretical approaches to address both facets of this gap. First, I will use the roundworm
Caenorhabditis elegans to dissect the contribution of epigenetic variation to phenotypic variation in two key
reproductive traits following specific environmental perturbations in isogenic populations. These experiments
will be performed at the single-worm level (using single-worm RNA-seq and ATAC-seq) to test the hypothesis
that differences in reproductive traits are caused by differences in the epigenetic state of single individuals.
Second, I will extend population-genetic models to incorporate epigenetic variation to test the hypothesis that
epigenetic variation is a major contributor to the maintenance of genetic variation in populations over many
generations. These complementary approaches take advantage of the strengths of each type of system. With
C. elegans, it is straight-forward to generate large populations of genetically identical individuals, and these
differ for quantitative traits, making it an ideal system to understand the influence of epigenetic variation on
phenotypic variation. Using theoretical models, in contrast, facilitates the incorporation of genetic and
epigenetic variation simultaneously to ask how epigenetic variants affect genetic variation over timescales that
are not feasible to test experimentally. Collectively, this work will make important progress toward the long-
term goal of identifying proximate and ultimate mechanisms driving phenotypic and genetic variation."
10812376,"Project Summary
School-based health centers (SBHCs) are at the frontlines of healthcare delivery and prevention services for
young patients across the United States. SBHCs provide vital services to school-aged youth, including
behavioral, sexual, and reproductive healthcare, often regardless of patients' insurance status or ability to pay.
Young patients who are gender or sexual minority (GSM) are far more likely to suffer from adverse health
outcomes than their cisgender and heterosexual peers. Structural or societal-based factors (e.g., stigma,
discrimination, low awareness of and insensitivity towards their health concerns) contribute to greater unmet
needs and poorer quality of care for GSM youth. Structural competency addresses the upstream factors (social
determinants of health, inadequate and fragmented treatment, inequities in care) that affect GSM students.
Enhancing structural competency within SBHCs will improve the care received by GSM students and, therefore,
their health. Emerging structural competency frameworks call for the cultivation of awareness and capacities in
SBHCs to modify organizational service delivery environments, including provider and staff knowledge and
behaviors, to influence wellbeing within this socially marginalized adolescent population. Nationally recognized
recommendations or guidelines for nurturing structural competency include (1) adoption, dissemination, and
enforcement of GSM supportive policies and procedures; (2) creation of welcoming physical environments for
GSM patients; (3) systematic documentation and use of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI)
information to inform and improve clinical services; (4) ongoing training for all employees in best practices for
interacting with GSM patients; and (5) clinical workforce development to encourage delivery of high-quality
services to GSM patients. This community-engaged implementation science study is scaffolded by school- and
SBHC-based research conducted in the rural, economically challenged, and culturally rich state of New Mexico.
This research provides a solid foundation for employing implementation science approaches to facilitate and
evaluate the adoption of these guidelines using the Dynamic Adaptation Process (DAP), a multifaceted
implementation strategy. We will conduct mixed-method readiness assessments to determine inner- and outer-
context determinants for implementing structurally competent changes in SBHCs; use a stepped-wedge trial
design to examine how DAP-enabled implementation impacts the adoption and effect of structurally competent
changes on SBHC, student (patient), and implementation outcomes; and assess the role of key inner- and outer-
context determinants, bridging factors, and associated mediators and moderators influencing implementation
processes and improved outcomes for GSM students. These outcomes include reduced barriers to care and
greater satisfaction and engagement in care. This study represents a key steppingstone to achieving our long-
term goal of high-quality care and decreased health and behavioral health disparities for GSM youth."

NK cells play essential roles in the immune response to intracellular pathogens, including
viruses and bacteria, and form an important defense against malignant transformation and
metastasis. In this R21 application, we propose experiments to test the hypotheses that the
transcription factor Helios is a central regulator of undifferentiated NK cells, supporting their self-
rewak and limiting effector maturation. We present evidence that Helios is expressed in the
most undifferentiated of mature NK cells and up-regulated in Ets1-deficient NK cells, which fail
to mature appropriately and have multiple defects in NK cell receptor expression and function.
We will create mice lacking Helios, or Ets1 and Helios, in NK cells to determine whether these
cells show premature effector maturation and altered response to cytokines, tumor cells
(melanoma) or virus (mouse cytomegalovirus). Our studies will provide a foundation for
understand the mechanisms underlying NK cell self-renewal effector maturation."
10833082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, tens of thousands of children, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) are estimated to live with severe
neurologic impairment (SNI), a condition that poses an unequal burden on families from minority and low-income
backgrounds. Over 60% of these children suffer from uncontrolled pain, which is often persistent, unrecognized, and
untreated. The impact extends to their parents who commonly experience unremitting physical and psychological
distress. There have been no rigorous intervention studies aimed at treating recurrent pain in children with SNI.
This gap may exist because children with SNI are stigmatized and often from historically marginalized
backgrounds, and not prioritized in scientific research. To address this inequity and using the ORBIT Model for
intervention development, the research team has adapted and refined an intervention previously applied in children with
cancer. The PediQUEST Response to Pain Of children with Neurologic Disability (PQ-ResPOND) uses “reciprocal
activation” strategies to overcome normalization, the acceptance among parents and clinicians that symptom distress
is an unavoidable outcome of serious illness and integration of a specialty pediatric palliative care team (PPC) to respond
to child distress. Specifically, PQ-ResPOND will combine (i) parent-mediated activation through weekly collection and
feedback to parents and clinicians, via our PQ App, of parent reported child pain (Non-Communicating Children’s Pain
Checklist-Revised scale (NCCPC-R)) and other symptoms (PediQUEST-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale
adapted for children with SNI), with (ii) PPC team activation of primary clinicians: through consultation by PPC, and
(iii) PPC team activation through training in a standardize recurrent pain approach using the PQ-ResPOND Checklist
(adapted by the study’s interprofessional expert panel).The overall hypothesis is that PQ-ResPOND will improve child
recurrent pain, and parent distress, burden, and activation. The overall objective of this R21 proposal is to conduct
a single site Phase II Pilot Feasibility 2:1 RCT of PQ-ResPOND (intervention, n=30) vs. usual care (control, n=15) in
45 children ≥1 year-old & AYA with SNI and recurrent pain behaviors. A 2-week run-in period will exclude children with
mild pain and survey non-responders. Parents of children who meet randomization criteria will answer weekly PQ-
ResPOND surveys and monthly outcome surveys over 12 weeks via the PQ App, and a semi-structured exit interview.
Specific Aims are to 1. assess the study’s feasibility (>60% enrollment rate and >80% retention), intervention
acceptability (>70% parents would recommend the intervention and most parents and clinicians provide positive
feedback during qualitative exit interviews), and estimate monthly enrollment rate; and 2. Estimate effect sizes and
variability of the proposed trial outcomes: child pain, parent distress and burden (anxiety, depression, stress, burden,
overall health, and sleep quality), and parent activation (use of complementary therapies and coping). Results will inform
the study design and sample size calculation of a larger Phase III Efficacy trial, development of a manual of procedures
and fidelity monitoring strategies. The interprofessional research team has the expertise to expand and test this PPC
intervention to ease pain in children with SNI, a novel population that is marginalized, stigmatized, and understudied."

Tissue engineering provides a strategy for developing better biomaterials for use in congenital heart surgery.
Results of our clinical trials evaluating the use of tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) in congenital heart
surgery have demonstrated the growth capacity of the TEVG making it the first man made graft with growth
potential. However, results of these trials have also revealed that stenosis is the most common graft-related
complication and the principle hurdle preventing its widespread clinical use. Recently, we have identified a novel
immune-regulatory protein encoded by the LYST gene. Mutations of the LYST gene dramatically reduce the
incidence of TEVG stenosis in murine models. In this proposal, we will investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the formation of LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. We will use a on-demand inducible
LYST-mutant mouse to determine the critical temporal factors underling this process. Next, we will use a
conditional LYST-mutant model to elucidate the roles of macrophages and determine the critical cell type(s)
responsible for driving LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. Finally, we will evaluate the role of extracellular vesicle-
dependent intercellular signaling on the formation of LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. Successful completion of
these studies would open the door to rationally designing strategies to inhibit the formation of TEVG stenosis
based on modulating LYST function. The development of an improved TEVG with growth capacity has the
potential to improve outcomes for children born with congenital heart disease."

 Voice is produced when the vocal folds are driven into a wave-like motion by the airstream from the trachea,
converting aerodynamic energy and airflow into acoustic energy in the form of sound. Each vocal fold consists
of a pliable vibratory layer of connective tissue, known as the lamina propria (LP), sandwiched between a muscle
and a stratified squamous epithelium (EP). Numerous environmental, mechanical and pathological factors can
damage this delicate tissue, resulting in vocal fold scarring that affects millions of Americans with limited
treatment options. Although there is a general consensus on the pathophysiology of vocal fold scarring, the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that control unremitting fibrosis remain poorly understood. Studies on other
fibrotic diseases suggest that fibroblasts, epithelial cells and the interstitial matrix are active players in
fibrogenesis. This project aims to engineer a reliable, physiologically relevant in vitro tissue model that can be
used to investigate vocal fold development, health, and disease, and more importantly, to facilitate the
development and testing of new treatment options. We propose to develop a microengineered organ chip that
integrates the epithelial and mesenchymal cells in a tissue-mimetic configuration with built-in airflow to stimulate
phonation. Using the microfluidic model, we will investigate how damage to the epithelium initiates fibrosis, how
the fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) sustains fibrosis and how myofibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition
continue unabated. Finally, we will calibrate our model with an antifibrotic growth factor that has shown efficacy
in treating vocal fold scarring, and test a promising pharmacological inhibitor that has not been previously tested
in the context of vocal fold scarring. Highly efficient bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation will be used to establish the
initial LP matrix surrounding healthy fibroblasts and to introduce compositional and mechanical alterations that
promote fibroblast activation. Pluripotent and multipotent stem cells will be guided to differentiate into vocal fold-
like epithelial cells and fibroblasts by adopting a development paradigm and through systematic manipulation of
the engineered microenvironment. Piezoresistive strain sensors embedded in the sidewalls of the microfluidic
channels will be used to monitor tissue stiffness and EP permeability in situ. The microengineered tissue model
will be characterized in terms of cell phenotype, microstructure, mechanical properties and physiological function.
For comparison purposes, a stand-alone, human-sized vocal fold model will be developed and characterized
employing methodologies established in the laryngology field. Data generated from this project should
significantly impact fundamental research related to vocal fold scarring and provide critical information on
therapeutic decision-making in the near future."

Neurons in the developing auditory system experience highly stereotyped bursts of activity prior to the onset of
sensory experience. This activity is initiated within the cochlea when non-sensory inner supporting cells
release ATP, triggering a cascade of events that ultimately induces trains of action potentials in spiral ganglion
neurons (SGNs) that propagate throughout the auditory system. The spatially restricted release of ATP triggers
correlated firing in groups of SGNs that will later encode similar frequencies of sound, providing a means to
induce activity-dependent maturation and refinement of sound processing circuits in the brain prior to hearing
onset. Despite the prominence of patterned activity during this critical developmental period, its role in
maturation of the auditory system remains poorly understood, in part, due to an inability to selectively disrupt
spontaneous activity while preserving sound transduction in the cochlea. Here, we propose to leverage newly
developed mouse models that allow selective disruption of spontaneous activity within cochlear supporting
cells yet preserve cochlear structure and the integrity of the auditory nerve. We will explicitly test the
hypothesis that burst firing of auditory neurons is critical to initiate structural and functional maturation of
nascent sound processing circuits. These studies will leverage genetic disruption of P2ry1 and Tmem16a, two
components required to generate spontaneous activity in cochlear supporting cells, with in vivo widefield and
two photon imaging of neuronal activity, RNA expression profiling and behavioral analyses of auditory function
to rigorously test this hypothesis. We will extend our recent discovery that astrocytes in the inferior colliculus
(IC) of pre-hearing mice are co-activated with surrounding neurons during spontaneous events, providing a
means to coordinate spatial and temporal maturation of tripartite synapses (excitatory synapses ensheathed by
astrocytes). Aim 1 will focus on the cochlea, determining how loss of P2RY1 and TMEM16A influence the
properties and developmental trajectory of SGNs. Aim 2 will define the relationship between cochlear and
extra-cochlear spontaneous activity in auditory cortex (AC), determine how disruption of cochlea-derived
spontaneous activity alters spatial patterns of neuronal activation in the IC and AC and ultimately influence
auditory discrimination. Aim 3 will define the patterns of neuronal activity required to induce calcium elevation
in astrocytes and determine how selective genetic disruption of astrocyte mGluR5 expression, which is
necessary to detect neuronal burst firing, influences astrocyte maturation and progressive refinement of
tonotopic representation of sounds in vivo. These studies will provide greater insight into the fundamental
mechanisms used to define circuits that process sound information and establish a framework to explore how
genetic mutations, trauma and exposure to ototoxic drugs during early life alter the processing capabilities of
central auditory circuits. Information gained from these studies may ultimately help establish new strategies to
compensate for developmental disruptions in cochlear output and improve the performance of cochlear
implants."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a major risk factor for poor bone quality and fractures, is associated with the premature
accumulation of senescent cells and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs; activators of the receptor for
AGE [RAGE] pathway) in multiple tissues, including bone. Intuitively, senescent cells and RAGE could act
independently or interact via cross-talk to contribute substantially to skeletal fragility in T2D, yet this concept
has not been rigorously tested. This proposal is founded on innovative concepts, technology, and approaches
to test our central hypothesis that targeting cellular senescence or RAGE can improve T2D-related skeletal
fragility. To test our hypothesis, we will use novel transgenic mice and innovative technology, including mass
cytometry as well as advanced histological and molecular tools. The interplay among bone, energy
metabolism, and T2D has been a topic of research for years, yet few in vivo studies have rigorously
interrogated the contributions of senescent cells or RAGE signaling to skeletal dysfunction in T2D. From a
translational perspective, better understanding of the cross-talk between senescence and RAGE in bone will
yield impactful advances and may reveal novel strategies to ameliorate accelerated skeletal aging in T2D. To
this end, in Aim 1 we will identify, locate, and characterize bone-resident senescent cell populations in mice
with T2D and define their T2D-specific senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In Aim 2, using
mice harboring transgenes that enable the selective elimination of p16Ink4a+ or p21Cip1+ senescent cells, we will
test the hypothesis that senescent cell clearance in mice with established T2D will normalize bone remodeling
and quality. Thus, we will distinguish the causal roles of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 in mediating skeletal dysfunction in
T2D using our global p16- and p21-ATTAC mouse strains by comparing the effects of systemic clearance of
p16Ink4a+ vs p21Cip1+ senescent cells. In addition, we will assess the relative impact of clearing senescent
osteocytes, using our novel Cre-LoxP lines – p16-LOX-ATTAC and p21-LOX-ATTAC. Global and osteocyte-
specific clearance of senescent cells will be compared with pharmacological elimination using “senolytics”.
Finally, in Aim 3, using our novel Cre-loxP mouse that inhibits RAGE signal transduction via cell-specific
cytosolic-domain deficient dominant-negative RAGE (DN-RAGE) expression, we will define the effects of
inhibiting RAGE signaling in the osteoblast/osteocyte and myeloid/osteoclast lineages on skeletal fragility in
mice with T2D. Collectively, these studies will rigorously test whether cellular senescence and RAGE signaling
underlie T2D-related skeletal fragility. We will address these questions by leveraging our unique resources and
expertise. We will build upon compelling preliminary data and innovative approaches, including novel
analytical, transgenic, and pharmacological tools that we anticipate will significantly advance our understanding
of the fundamental biology of skeletal dysfunction in T2D, leading to new mechanistic insights, and evidence-
based therapeutic approaches to facilitate the translation of preclinical discoveries to clinical applications."
10866569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 People of Latin American origin are projected to comprise over 28% of the United States (U.S.) population
by 2060 and close to 70% of the Latino population is comprised of people of Mexican origin. Racial and ethnic
minorities in the U.S., including people of Mexican origin, face higher rates of perceived discrimination and
economic hardship. Prior research suggests that exposure to these forms of adversity leads to both higher risk
for depression as well as increased allostatic load, or physical wear-and-tear on the body. In contrast, some
research in African American samples suggests that ‘resilience,’ or resistance to developing mental health
problems under conditions of adversity, may incur a cost of increased allostatic load during young adulthood. It
is plausible that this mechanism may also occur for Mexican-origin individuals. This indicates a critical need to
examine allostatic load in addition to depression symptoms to test whether some individuals who may appear
‘resilient’ in terms of low depression symptoms exhibit increased allostatic load in young adulthood. The current
proposal aims to establish the association between adversity in adolescence and depression symptoms and
allostatic load in young adulthood for those of Mexican origin, identify neural mechanisms mediating these
associations, and discover protective factors that can mitigate these processes of risk. In this study, the research
team proposes to collect a new wave of longitudinal data in the California Families Project (CFP), a longitudinal
study that has followed 674 Mexican-origin youth and their families since youth were 10 years old. The study will
capitalize on previous waves of longitudinal data collected in the CFP, including multi-informant assessments
collected annually from age 10 to 21 and functional MRI data collected when youth were 16 and 19 years old.
For this R01, the research team proposes to add a new wave of data collection (age 25 years) to assess allostatic
load, current depression symptoms, and self-report of potential protective factors. The research team will test
the following specific aims: 1) Examine the association between economic hardship and perceived discrimination
experienced during adolescence and depression symptoms and allostatic load in young adulthood. 2) Identify
the neural mechanisms through which specific forms of adversity predict depression symptoms and allostatic
load in young adulthood. 3) Examine how ethnic identity, familism, parent-child relationship quality, self-esteem,
active coping, optimism, and religiosity moderate associations between adversity, neural activity, depression
symptoms, and allostatic load. This research will determine how adolescent adversity predicts depression and
allostatic load in Mexican-origin young adults, identify neural mechanisms of risk that could be targeted in
interventions, and identify protective factors that can mitigate depression risk that could be targeted in
interventions. Critically, this research will establish which protective factors mitigate risk for depression without
leading to increased allostatic load in young adulthood."

 Nearly all sensory information destined for the neocortex is relayed through the thalamus. The thalamic
reticular nucleus (TRN), a thin shell of GABAergic neurons surrounding the dorsal thalamus, receives both
collaterals from cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical glutamatergic inputs, but exerts its unidirectional powerful
inhibition only to the thalamus. TRN thus is considered as a master controller of thalamo-cortical circuits
regulating the flow of the information between thalamus and neocortex. Perturbed TRN function may underlie
behavioral deficits in disorders ranging from schizophrenia, ADHD and autism. Although the importance of the
TRN has long been recognized, our knowledge of its molecular identity of cell types, their organization and
their functional properties has lagged behind that of the thalamocortical circuits they control. The paucity of
such knowledge has limited our ability to determine exactly how TRN circuitry contributes to various brain
functions, a prerequisite for determining how it malfunctions in diseases and how its circuitry can be leveraged
for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Our most recent work has filled this critical gap in knowledge. By
using single nucleus RNAseq, for the first time we have discovered that TRN neurons can be dissociated into
two major subtypes with distinct transcriptomic profiles, anatomical localizations, electrophysiological
properties and thalamic connectivity. One subtype, located in the “core” region of the TRN and can be marked
by the expression of the Spp1 gene, targets first-order sensory thalamic nuclei, and the other, located in the
“shell” region of the TRN and marked by the expression of Ecel1 gene, targets higher-order ones. We have
generated transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase in each of these two populations individually. This
proposal aims to use these new knowledge and genetic tools to provide a comprehensive map of TRN cell-
type specific connectivity patterns, TRN subcircuit electrophysiological properties and synaptic mechanism,
and how abnormal function of distinct TRN subcircuits contribute to behavioral deficits of autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) using a novel monogenic form of ASD, Ptchd1 deletion mouse model."

Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are widely used in human gene therapy: e.g. two products have been FDA
approved and three vectors, which correct the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia by hepatic gene transfer,
are in Phase III clinical trials. Undesired and sometimes unexpected immune responses to vector or transgene
product can impede long-lasting therapy, including CD8+ T cell and antibody responses to transgene product
and viral capsid, which at high systemic vector doses occasionally induce severe immune toxicities.
Consequently, short-term immune suppression, for example by corticosteroids has now been incorporated into
many protocols and B cell depletion is being explored. This proposal seeks to elucidate the molecular and cellular
underpinnings of innate and adaptive immune responses to AAV-transduced mouse and human hepatocytes.
The experiments are designed to test the central hypothesis that a targeted blockade of innate immune
responses and specific cytokine signaling pathways combined with an empowered immune regulation are
requisite for a successful hepatic AAV-directed gene transfer. This concept is based upon the outcomes of
studies, which establish that: 1. The liver is an excellent target for immune tolerance induction to transgene
products owing to its microenvironment that ultimately empowers regulatory T cells (Treg) to control antibody
and T cell responses. 2. Immune modulatory protocols using rapamycin by itself or in combination with other
drugs result in the desired immune regulation. 3. Cross-priming of capsid-specific CD8+ T cells requires
cooperation between different subsets of dendritic cells, which critically involves TLR9-MyD88 signaling and IFN
I. 4. For TLR9-independent activation of transgene product-specific CD8+ T cells in the liver, IL-1R is requisite.
5. State-of-the art in vitro culture techniques and ability to in vivo expand both human hepatocytes and human
innate immune cells in immunodeficient mice have been developed. 6. Formation of neutralizing antibodies
directed against coagulation factor VIII and capsid upon hepatic AAV gene transfer can be prevented and
sustained therapy is achieved hemophilia A mice by optimal immune modulation. Based on these findings, the
proposal seeks to i) define the innate immune response of human hepatocytes and liver environment in AAV
gene transfer; ii) define the mechanism by which the IL-1R-MyD88 signaling pathway promotes CD8+ T cell
responses in hepatic AAV gene transfer; and iii) develop optimal transient immune modulatory regimens that
prevent B and T cell responses to the transgene product and the vector and thereby assure sustained therapy."

Genomics data sharing is of paramount importance to accelerate biomedical research and facilitate higher power
in analysis. However, privacy and security concerns can hinder large scale data sharing across institutions and
nations. Human genomics data contain unique information that is identifiable, and inappropriate sharing would
put individual’s privacy at risk and potentially lead to leakage of sensitive personal information. Also, patients’
consents are crucial for genomic studies, and therefore novel sociotechnical methods are also essential for
researchers to consider while conducting human genomic research. We intend to close the technology gap and
bring advanced enabling technology to support human genomic research. We have organized a series of
competitions to evaluate state-of-the-art privacy and security models with real-world motivated analysis tasks
with companion workshops. As an emerging interdisciplinary community, we are pushing the frontiers of genomic
privacy and security research. Motivated by our previous successes, we are proposing to continue the effort.
We plan to engage and support researchers from nationally underrepresented groups to participate in our
competitions and attend the workshops."
10836995,"ABSTRACT: Microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease and a
predictor of end organ damage, both in the general population and in persons living with HIV (PLWH).
Microalbuminuria, defined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) 30-300 mg/g, can signify either early
glomerular damage or microvascular endothelial dysfunction and has been used in the early detection of
kidney disease. Microalbuminuria is also an important risk factor for mortality in PLWH treated with
antiretroviral therapy (ART), likely as a marker for inflammation and endothelial activation. In the ongoing
Renal Risk Reduction (R3) study in Nigeria, 36.9% had microalbuminuria confirmed by two measurements 4-
8 weeks apart, and 2.8% had macroalbuminuria (uACR >300 mg/g). The median duration on ART was 9 years
[IQR 6,12], median CD4 cell count was 482 cells/mm3 [IQR 324–661], 95.7% were virally suppressed, and
12.7% had stage 1 or 2 hypertension (22.1% with pre-hypertension). In contrast, other traditional risk factors
for albuminuria and kidney disease, including diabetes (2.1%), APOL1 high-risk genotype (6.2%), and smoking
(5%) were uncommon. A significant proportion (~59%) were currently receiving potentially nephrotoxic ARV
medications, specifically tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Lastly, endemic co-infections, including viral (e.g.
hepatitis B and C, Cytomegalovirus), parasitic (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum, Schistosoma species,
Strongyloides stercoralis, Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa, Wuchereria bancrofti), and bacterial (Mycobacterium
tuberculosis) co-infections, may be potential contributors to albuminuria. To better understand this, we plan to
test the following overarching hypothesis: Hypertension, immune activation from co-infections, and
cumulative, long-term exposure to potentially nephrotoxic ARV medications contribute to the high
rates of microalbuminuria in these ART-experienced adults. To test this hypothesis, we propose the
following Specific Aims:
 1) To compare the prevalence of albuminuria and established kidney disease risk factors in a large cohort
 of PLWH to age- and sex-matched HIV-negative adults presenting for routine medical care at the Aminu
 Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano, Nigeria. We will leverage data and stored specimens from 2500 R3
 participants who were previously screened for microalbuminuria and will prospectively enroll an additional
 300 PLWH recently initiated on ART (≤ 12 months) and 750 age- and sex-matched HIV-negative adults.
 2) To determine the role that hypertension and other comorbid medical conditions (e.g. sickle cell trait or
 disease, immune activation/inflammation from parasitic infestations and tuberculosis, and exposure to
 potentially nephrotoxic ARV medications), have on the risk for development of albuminuria. We will enroll
 1000 HIV-positive, ART-treated normoalbuminuric adults and 500 HIV-negative normoalbuminuric adults
 from Aim 1 and follow them longitudinally for three years."
10864944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemophilia A is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding coagulation factor
VIII (FVIII). Current treatment involves repeated i.v. infusions of FVIII concentrates throughout the life of the
patient, which creates tremendous discomfort and morbidity. Alternatively, we seek to develop a novel
technology for sustained FVIII delivery. Recently, we developed a non-viral ex vivo gene therapy approach for
hemophilia A. We used a piggyBac DNA transposon system to insert 70 copies of the F8 gene into human
pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). We differentiated these modified F8-PSCs into endothelial cells (iECs; natural
producers of FVIII) and demonstrated the production of exceedingly high levels of FVIII. After subcutaneous
engraftment of our human F8-iECs into immunodeficient hemophilic (SCID-f8ko) mice, we achieved up to 600%
circulating levels of FVIII, effectively correcting the clotting deficiency. Notwithstanding this progress, our open-
graft approach has some inherent limitations for translation: 1) immune rejection of non-autologous cells, and 2)
concerns over cell dissemination and safety. To address these limitations, we have teamed up with Dr. Minglin
Ma (Cornell), who has extensive experience with devices for encapsulation and transplantation of cells in mice
and dogs. We propose a technology entailing a novel retrievable encapsulation device. We will assemble our
F8-iECs into stable 3D vascular organoids and will then embed multiple organoids into an alginate hydrogel
inside a tubular encapsulation device (1-mm diameter; variable length). Based on our preliminary data,
we hypothesize that our device will protect the cells from immune rejection and produce FVIII that will reach the
bloodstream at therapeutic levels upon implantation into the peritoneal cavity. To test these hypotheses, we
propose three Specific Aims. In Aim-1, we will genetically engineer vascular organoids for the production of
clinically relevant levels of FVIII. We will develop a new promoterless exon-trap sensor cassette to avoid intra-
exon integration of our piggyBac transposon. We will then insert multiple F8 copies into NIH-eligible PSC lines
to generate universal clones for high FVIII production. In Aim-2, we will establish an encapsulation device
configuration for optimal FVIII production and determine the safety and long-term efficacy in immunocompetent
hemophilic mice. We will evaluate cell survival, BDD-FVIII activity in plasma, correction of coagulation deficiency,
risk of teratoma formation, and reversibility of the treatment. In Aim-3, we will evaluate the safety and long-term
efficacy of our devices in dogs. We will first generate canine-specific FVIII-secreting vascular organoids. We will
then transplant our devices (I.P.) in healthy dogs for up to 6 months and evaluate scalability, safety, retrievability,
and FVIII production. Lastly, we will test our allogeneic devices in hemophilia A dogs and establish safety and
efficacy for up to 1 year. In summary, we propose studies to develop a novel technology to deliver FVIII in
hemophilia A. We envision this research could pave the way for future studies in humans."

Successful muscle regeneration requires an elaborate cellular choreography between multiple
cell populations to remove and replace damaged fibers. Disruption of this choreography leads to
muscle degeneration and fibrotic or adipogenic replacement of myofibers. This phenomenon is
particularly prevalent in muscular dystrophies, where progressive muscle loss leads to severe
debilitation and early loss of life. Hence, there is growing need to understand the cell
populations and their interactions which contribute to myofiber regeneration, but can lead to
fibrotic or adipogenic replacement when gone awry. This project aims to understand the
mechanism underlying impaired cellular interactions leading to myofiber loss and muscle
weakness in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and test approaches to prevent this
impairment. This understanding will help develop novel targeted therapeutic approaches to
arrest disease progression in this and other muscular dystrophies that are currently without
effective treatment options."

Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by intestinal inflammation, increased mucosal cytokines and
compromised epithelial barrier function. Epithelial barrier function is regulated by intercellular junctions that
encompass the tight junction (TJ), adherens junction (AJ) and desmosomes (DMs). It is now evident that
intercellular junctions are highly dynamic structures and their component proteins actively participate in
regulating epithelial homeostasis. Mucosal inflammation compromises epithelial homeostatic properties
thereby resulting in epithelial barrier compromise which contributes to disease pathogenesis. Our knowledge of
the molecular basis of intercellular junction protein cross-talk, epithelial homeostasis and compromised barrier
in intestinal inflammation is however very limited. Thus the overall goals of this proposal are to identify
mechanisms by which intercellular junction proteins control epithelial homeostasis, barrier function and repair
after injury in disease. We will specifically investigate the role of two key intercellular junction proteins,
claudin23 and desmoglein 2 in regulating the intestinal epithelial barrier function and repair after injury. The
influence of inflammatory cytokines on such regulatory processes will be determined. In addition to gaining
insights into the molecular basis of intestinal epithelial barrier regulation, these studies will provide new ideas
for the development of therapeutic agents that strengthen the intestinal epithelial barrier, promote wound repair
and reduce mucosal inflammation. These studies will also provide insight into strategies of transiently
perturbing the epithelial barrier for therapeutic drug/vaccine delivery."

The identification of the Apolipoprotein L-1 or APOL1 gene as an indicator of increased likelihood of developing
chronic kidney disease has sparked a debate about point-of-care genetic testing for potential living kidney
donors. While integrating genetic testing into the medical evaluation of potential living donors benefits patients,
ensuring an informed, deliberative decision making process is paramount. The proposed study is premised on
a large body of research demonstrating that traditional SDM processes and interventions fail to meet the needs
of ethnic minority populations. Because SDM requires an informed patient to engage in the decision making
process, novel methods are needed to assure a full, accurate understanding of risks, benefits, implications and
alternate options. We propose a participatory approach to developing a decisional support tool for African
American potential donors as they consider genetic testing as part of their medical evaluation. Specifically, this
mixed-method study will conduct the formative research needed to develop and refine the tool. Up to 6 focus
group interviews will explore potential donors' preferences for shared decision making and understanding of
the risks, benefits and implications of genetic testing in the context of live kidney donation (Aim 1). The findings
will inform the design of a brief quantitative survey assessing potential donors' decision-making preferences,
communication style, and knowledge of and attitudes toward genetic testing, kidney transplantation and living
donation. The survey (N=500) will be the first to include the Best-Worst Scaling methodology to assess the
level of importance potential donors place on the risks and benefits of genetic testing as well as trade offs
between risks and benefits donors are willing to make (Aim 2). A draft of the tool will be created, using the
Ottowa Framwork as guide, to support African American patients and their families making decisions about
both living donor kidney transplants and genetic testing in this context. Additional modifications will be made
based on the findings of the focus group interviews and completed surveys. The tool will then be refined
iteratively over four rounds of testing in simulated consultations with standardized providers and four rounds
with a Delphi panel of transplant professionals (Aim 3). A Stakeholder Committee, comprised of transplant
professionals and previous and potential living donors, will provide ongoing feedback and guidance across all
study phases. In a subsequent R01, the fully-vetted, newly developed tool will be implemented and tested in
clinical settings using a randomized controlled design. If successful, the tool will optimize care for the
thousands of African American potential living kidney donors evaluated in the United States annually."

Infants use their eyes to gather information from their environment and learn about the unique scenes and
objects that surround them. As infants accumulate these experiences, their cortex is concurrently maturing to
support more controlled attention and visual processes. However, it is unclear how much of the development of
gaze control reflects cortical maturation versus individual experiences. Therefore, the proposed project seeks
to evaluate three competing hypotheses regarding respective roles of maturation and experience. We will use
both traditional eye tracking analyses as well as advanced computational modeling. Specifically, in Aim 1, we
will record infant looking behaviors while viewing scenes and objects that range in familiarity and assess how
stimulus properties (e.g., salience, meaningfulness) relate to looking patterns for familiar and unfamiliar images
across the first year of life. In Aim 2, we will relate these looking behaviors to a convolutional neural network
inspired by the mature brain’s visual system. This innovative approach will evaluate the relationship between
infants’ looking behaviors and use of higher-level visual processing across contexts that vary in familiarity.
Ultimately, results from this proposal will inform developmental theories of visual attention by characterizing the
contributions of maturational versus experiential factors. The information gained from the results of this project
may facilitate future assessments and interventions of clinical populations with atypical visual scanning and
attention control. To successfully accomplish these aims, it is necessary that the applicant gains theoretical and
methodological expertise in both infant and adult attention research. This integrative perspective will allow her
to characterize infant attention and visual behaviors using sophisticated methodological and analytical
approaches, which will ultimately generate a wide range of subsequent research questions using similar
techniques. These aims will be most successfully completed under the supervision and mentorship of Drs. Lisa
Oakes and Steven Luck at the University of California, Davis, who are experts on attention in infant and adult
populations, respectively. The proposed training goals focus on expanding content knowledge of attention and
gaining methodological expertise in convolutional neural networks and representational similarity analysis.
Accomplishing these training goals will better prepare the applicant for a successful independent research
career that pushes the field of attention development forward."

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) affect a wide range of endocrine and neurobiological
functions. Animal models show causal relationships between exposure and adverse outcomes,
and epidemiological data in humans support correlations between EDC exposure and
neurobehavioral deficits. My proposal seeks to investigate the effects of perinatal EDC exposure
on the development of estrogen-sensitive neural midbrain dopamine (DA) circuits involved in
attentional and affective reward-processing behaviors. Here, I will test the hypothesis that
perinatal EDC exposure will lead to deficits in DAergic behaviors via disruption of estrogenic
signaling mechanisms that regulate cellular, molecular and epigenetic processes in the
developing brain DA system. Furthermore, gestational exposure affects both the fetus and
developing germ cells within the fetal gonad that become the sperm/ova leading to the F2
generation. Therefore, my work will focus on rats of both sexes in the F1 and F2 generations. To
do this, I will utilize a well-established EDC model of polychlorinated biphenyls using Aroclor 1221
(A1221), a weakly estrogenic mixture. Gestational exposure to A1221 perturbs neurobiological
development, and has latent effects on neuroendocrine functions, gene expression in the brain,
and behavior, in a sex-specific manner. However, its influence on attentional and affective reward-
processing behaviors is unknown; this is an important gap in knowledge. Effects of exposures will
be observed across two generations: F1 (exposed during gestation) and F2 (exposed as
developing germ cells). A primary outcome will be the display of attentional and affective reward-
processing behavioral outcomes during adulthood, as these behaviors are estrogen-sensitive and
associated with sex-biased mental health disorders in humans. Additionally, I will quantify
corresponding changes in the neuroanatomical organization of the brain’s dopamine system, and
expression of genes involved in estrogen and dopamine signaling. Because at least part of the
mechanism for brain organization is through actions of hormones on DNA methylation to
“program” how these genes function later in life, the research will also determine if epigenetic
changes (DNA methylation) are a mechanism for long-term changes in gene expression in
response to EDC exposure during critical developmental periods. These goals meet the NIEHS’
strategic goal to “investigate the effects of the environment on genome structure and function”,
including epigenetic regulation of biological processes, while including sex as a biological
variable. Moreover, the proposal extends our understanding of environmental influences on
behavioral and molecular endpoints relevant to cognitive and behavioral disorders in humans."

Although direct acting antivirals can cure Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a vaccine is necessary to stop new
infections, and to prevent re-infections in the cured individuals. Studies in humans and chimpanzees suggest
that both T cells and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) can play an important role in the clearance of HCV infection.
However, further progress on HCV vaccine development has been stymied by a lack of animal models. Notably,
the nature, breadth, and relative contribution of humoral and cellular immunity in determining the outcomes
of HCV infection remain poorly understood. We recently showed that a rat hepacivirus (HCV-like virus),
RHV, shares the hallmarks of HCV infection and immunity. A majority of fully-immunocompetent rats develop
lifelong viral persistence, and thus rats are appropriate models for “proof-of-concept” vaccination studies to
prevent HCV- like viral persistence, the desired goal of HCV vaccines. We further validated this model by
determining that like reported from HCV studies in chimpanzees, rats vaccinated using an Adenovirus
expressing RHV non-structural (NS) proteins develop partial protection against persistence of a
homologous RHV strain (Nature communications, PMC6405742). Interestingly, we observed that the
vaccinated rats that cleared a homologous virus developed more efficient and broader immunity for
homologous and heterologous viruses, and T cell escape variants. These results suggest that the short-
term viral infection either enhances T cell immunity or generates nAbs, or both, to confer effective immunity
against heterologous viruses. Most importantly, these results are promising for defining the nature of
immunity that confers effective protection against persistent infection of genetically diverse viruses, like HCV
variants. The overall goal of this project is to define the immune correlates of protection against hepacivirus
persistence. Specific aim-1 is to define the T cell correlates of protection against hepacivirus persistence.
Our hypothesis is that the nature and breadth of virus-specific T cells determines the fate of hepacivirus
infections. Specific aim-2 is to study the role of envelope proteins (E1/E2) induced immunity and importance
of nAbs in virus clearance. Our hypothesis is that a vaccination approach using a combination of NS and
E1E2 vaccines will increase the immunity against viral persistence. Specific Aim- 3 is to define the breadth of
vaccine induced immunity, and to identify the viral determinants of vaccine failure. Our hypothesis is that
vaccination can prevent persistence of genetically diverse viruses that share only a few T cell epitopes. The
proposed dissection of vaccine and short-term viral infection conferred immunity is necessary to understand
the relative contributions of T and B cells in hepacivirus clearance, and this knowledge can help in
conceptualizing an effective vaccination strategy for HCV. Finally, the proposed characterization of T and B
cell immunity in this unique model of life-long persistent RNA virus infection will pave the way for testing of newer
vaccination approaches (like RNA vaccines) to prevent chronic virus infection."
10735889,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Humans constantly encounter microbes in their diets and environments, but only a tiny fraction of these
microbes take up long-term residence in the adult gut microbiome. Microbiome therapeutics like probiotics and
fecal microbiota transplants often seek to introduce new, desirable microbes, but these strains are frequently
lost and fail to stably colonize existing communities. Understanding the ecological interactions that affect
colonization and transmission is crucial for designing successful targeted microbiome therapeutics. Ecological
theory predicts that factors like cross-feeding, nutrient competition, and priority effects may affect the ability of
new microbes to colonize established communities, but there remain few examples of ecological interactions
that affect colonization in the human gut microbiome. Here, we propose to investigate ecological interactions in
microbial communities that affect colonization and transmission in natural and experimental gut microbial
communities. We plan to focus on households, which are natural settings of microbial transmission. We have
already recruited a longitudinal household cohort to document transmission after antibiotic exposure in the adult
gut microbiome which allows us to determine how disturbances affect strain colonization. We will also use a
novel experimental system to test the role of ecological factors like community diversity, ecological drift, and
environmental perturbations. First, we will track transmission events within households in the human gut
microbiome after antibiotic exposure by performing metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from the
household cohort. By analyzing these data, we will identify transmission events that occur before and after
antibiotic exposure, and we will track the trajectories of mutations that arise after strain transmission, as strains
propagate in new hosts and communities. Next, we will characterize the effects of ecological drift and community
diversity on transmission in ex vivo microbial communities. We have generated ex vivo communities from stool
samples collected from our household cohort, and we will mix pairs of communities to evaluate the effects of
strain dosage and community diversity on transmission. Finally, we will systematically mix ex vivo communities
to identify strains capable of colonizing communities before and after antibiotic perturbation. Together, this work
will provide important new information about the ecological factors that shape microbial colonization and
transmission. The initial, exploratory work proposed here will also pave the way for future work that uses these
collections of gut-derived communities to identify and characterize molecular and metabolic interactions between
strains that affect microbial colonization, helping us design more effective, targeted microbiome therapeutics."

The goal of the proposed research is to define and characterize the long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) encoded
and expressed in animals, including humans, and the proteins that bind, modify, and process this dsRNA. A key,
health-related, focus is how this endogenous dsRNA is discriminated from the long viral dsRNA that is recognized
as foreign to trigger an innate immune response. Recent studies show that in both vertebrates and invertebrates,
the RNA editing enzymes called Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA, or ADARs, deaminate endogenous
dsRNA so that it will not trigger an aberrant immune response. The mechanism by which ADARs, and the editing
sites they create, preclude activation of an innate immune response is unclear, and the proposed research is
designed to fill this gap in knowledge. Using genetic screens and molecular approaches, the model organism C.
elegans will be used to discover RNAs and proteins that lead to an immune response in strains lacking ADARs;
biochemical approaches will be used to provide in-depth mechanistic insights. While mammals use the interferon
pathway to mount an antiviral response, invertebrates lack this pathway, and instead, use RNA interference
(RNAi) in antiviral defense. The enzyme Dicer is key to the antiviral RNAi pathway and is essential for cleaving
viral dsRNA during the invertebrate immune response. Our prior in vitro studies indicate Dicer's helicase domain
recognizes the ends of viral dsRNA as “nonself”, or foreign, and the proposed studies are designed to test this
in vivo. The helicase domain of invertebrate Dicers is a fascinating molecular motor, and biochemistry, transient
kinetic analyses, and structural biology, will be used to understand how it coordinates dsRNA cleavage, and
ultimately passes small RNA products to downstream factors that enable gene silencing by the RNAi pathway.
Modulation of Dicer's activity by accessory factors that interact with the helicase domain will be investigated.
Differences in activities of the helicase domain of human Dicer and invertebrate Dicers will be explored to
understand how this enzyme evolved as the immune pathways of vertebrates and invertebrates diverged."
10813158,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We will investigate how cytoskeletal organelles organize into patterns in the cell. The fields of motile cilia
in epithelial cells and the rows of stereocilia in the inner hair cells are examples of physiologically-
important organelle patterns. The known pathways do not satisfactorily explain how organelle patterns
form. The ciliated protists (ciliates) assemble unusually complex surface (cortical) patterns. Ciliates
faithfully duplicate their cortical pattern during cell division and, despite its complexity, the cortical pattern
remains nearly invariable in a population. Thus, even subtle deviations from the normal pattern (e.g. due
to a mutation or trauma) can be detected and analyzed over many generations. In the genetic model
ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, hundreds of cortical organelles, including cilia, are arranged along the
anteroposterior and circumferential (left-right) axes. We recently identified causal mutations in several
classical Tetrahymena pattern mutants, in which organelles assemble at incorrect positions. We found
that orthologs of the Hippo pathway kinases and cyclin E are critical for patterning on the anteroposterior
axis. We identified a strong candidate for Hpo1, a protein that regulates the positions of organelles on
the cell’s circumferential axis. The molecular activities through which these pattern-regulating proteins
act, and the basis of their restricted cortical localizations, remain unknown. We will explore the molecular
composition of the pathways that drive pattern formation in Tetrahymena, study the properties of the
pattern-regulating proteins and develop genetic and biochemical screens to systematically unravel the
principles of intracellular patterning through unbiased approaches. The overarching goal for Aim 1 is to
uncover the molecular circuitry of “early” Hippo signaling that controls the initial positions of organelles
that form during cell division on the anteroposterior cell axis in Tetrahymena. Aim 2 will investigate how
the “late” Hippo signaling circuit and cyclin E interact (in a mutually antagonistic manner) to induce and
maintain cortical structures that form at the division plane. Aim 3 will investigate factors that regulate the
circumferential pattern, including Hpo1, a protein that localizes to the right side of the cell."

Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at
5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic
options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the
appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted
patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual
abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in
quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical
treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to
leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the
adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible,
deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language
processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with
systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify
contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct
a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the
algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from
clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients,
the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms
will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The
proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP,
CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and
Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources
required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths
of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical
informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and
skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead
multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of
the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to
support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics-
based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care."
10825543,"Despite the steady decline in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) morbidity and mortality in the US in the last few
decades, African American (AA) adults bear a disproportionate share of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden.
Psychosocial factors—including neighborhood adversity, daily interpersonal stressors (i.e., racial
discrimination, social isolation, negative interactions with others), and emotional reactivity to these stressors—
are believed to contribute to the etiology and progression of CVD through their effects on health behaviors, the
stress-responsive neuroendocrine axes, and immune processes. These factors are particularly salient for
urban-dwelling middle-aged and older AAs, who experience unique stressors (e.g., residential segregation,
racial discrimination, prejudice) and are more likely to live in situations of socioeconomic disadvantage than
Whites. However, psychosocial factors and their link to CVD risk, and inflammation more broadly, have been
remarkably understudied among AA adults. A fine-grained characterization of the daily stressors, health
behaviors, and emotional responses related to CVD—and understanding of the situational contexts in which
those occur—will significantly advance the science of CVD risk. Accordingly, the purpose of the proposed
project is to identify and conceptualize—through a mixed-method approach—the psychosocial stressors most
salient for this population and to model the daily psychological, behavioral, and biological pathways through
which these factors may exacerbate CVD risk among middle-aged and older AAs. By adopting a prospective
(two waves over two years) and multiple-time-scale design (daily assessments nested within waves), we will
test this idea in a sample of 500 asymptomatic AAs aged 55-75 years living in Detroit. We will also use semi-
structured interviews to collect qualitative data from 60 participants to contextualize the quantitative results.
Our central hypothesis is that interpersonal stressors will predict decreases in resting heart rate variability and
increases in resting blood pressure, poor sleep, chronic physiological stress (hair cortisol), and inflammation
(basal and stimulated cytokines and basal CRP) by altering daily affect, daily health behaviors, and daily
physiological stress (salivary cortisol). We propose to increase the innovation of our work by (1) using a
smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment protocol to measure psychosocial stress, (2) including a
sequential explanatory mixed-method design, (3) adopting a multiple-time-scale research design and a
standardized measure of neighborhood deprivation created ad hoc for Detroit, and (4) simultaneously
considering multiple measures of physiological stress, inflammation, and surrogate endpoints of CVD. The
rationale for the proposed research is that once a clear picture of the daily psychosocial risk factors for CVD is
formulated, and their biological intermediaries are identified, more culturally and individually tailored treatments
can be developed to reduce CVD in this population."
10818393,"Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (sRCC) represents an aggressive group of renal epithelial tumors
characterized by histopathological features of epithelial–mesenchymal plasticity (EMT) and prominent metastatic
behavior. These malignancies are extremely challenging in the clinic, as they fail to respond to the standard-of-
care therapeutic regimens for RCC. Furthermore, in spite of the remarkable advances in cancer genomics, there
are still no reliable tools or biomarkers to predict the clinical course of the disease, particularly in the context of
modern therapeutic interventions. Objectives. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the genomic and
molecular drivers of malignant progression in sRCC, focusing on the role of EMT in clonal evolution, in the
acquisition of metastatic potential and as a mechanism of adaptation to therapy. This will lead to the identification
of context-specific vulnerabilities dictated by the specific genomic and molecular landscapes that characterize
this aggressive subset of kidney cancer. Rationale and Hypothesis. Preliminary studies showing the
emergence of specific patterns of chromosomal alterations led us to the hypothesis that the acquisition of
chromosomal instability (CIN) during tumor evolution favors the selection of clones endowed with high cellular
plasticity and prominent metastatic potential. Specific Aims. In the first aim we will provide a detailed spatial
and temporal annotation of epithelial and mesenchymal population dynamics during malignant progression and
in response to pharmacological interventions. The second aim will define the genomic and transcriptomic
landscape of the malignant subpopulation and the interplay between these cellular compartments and the
components of the TME. In the third aim we will identify context-specific vulnerabilities, defining the genetic
dependencies of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Significance. The approach will provide fundamental
information about clonal dynamics, tumor–host interactions at a single-cell resolution, and tumor evolution in
RCC, substantially improving our understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of the disease.
Translational relevance. A detailed understanding of the genetic and molecular events driving malignant cell
plasticity and the evolution to sRCC will provide the framework to predict the behavior of this heterogeneous
group of tumors. Furthermore, the functional genomic approach will uncover context-specific vulnerabilities and
provide novel drug targets in a disease class in urgent need of effective treatments. Innovation. The project is
innovative from a conceptual and technological standpoint. Targeting cancer-specific weaknesses emerging in
the context of cell plasticity, increased tumor heterogeneity, and clonal diversification is a promising approach
tailored to the genetic and functional hallmarks of the disease. The technological tools and approaches are
unique and highly innovative. The introduction of a lineage-tracing technology and an embedded dynamic
reporter will allow us to address several open questions in the field of EMT going beyond the specific tumor type.
The work will therefore provide the scientific community with a valuable tool for basic and translational research."
10594049,"The five year survival rate for lung cancer is ~20% despite improved screening methods and advances in
treatment. Tumor metastasis is one of the major causes of death in cancer patients. Besides the dysregulated
signaling in tumor cells, the survival of dislodged circulating tumors from detachment-induced apoptosis
(anoikis) and immune attack in the blood depends on a crosstalk between the tumor and support cells in the
tumor microenvironment, including blood platelets. Lung cancer patients with high platelet count are often
associated with worst survival and a lower efficacy towards chemotherapeutic agents. Although platelets are a
determinant in tumor metastasis, current anti-platelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) with an established role
in cardiovascular disease, has challenges when deployed for the management of cancer. Therefore, new
approaches to better understand the platelet-cancer crosstalk is needed to identify novel platelet targets.
Interestingly, platelets from cancer subjects have quantitative changes in the proteome. It is currently unknown
if the cancer-induced changes in platelet protein(s) merely serve as a biomarker(s) or promote disease
progression. This critical unanswered problem in the field has the potential to provide new insights into disease
mechanisms that are influenced by platelets. Recent studies suggest a role for the catalytic subunit of protein
phosphatase 1 (PP1c) in the platelet-cancer crosstalk. Our preliminary studies revealed that the platelets
isolated from human lung cancer patients and mice with experimental lung cancer show increased PP1cα
protein compared to the non-cancer controls. Importantly, conditional deletion of PP1cα in platelets showed
reduced tumor burden in an experimental model of lung cancer metastasis. Our overarching hypothesis is that
platelet PP1cα facilitates lung cancer metastasis by reducing detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) and/or
promoting an immunosuppressive milieu. This proposal will determine how platelet PP1cα promotes lung
cancer metastasis using novel mice models and investigators with expertise in platelet phosphatases, cancer
biology, platelet-cancer cross talk and immunology of lung cancer. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of
platelet PP1cα in lung cancer survival and metastasis. Aim 2 will determine the role of platelet PP1cα on
immune responses to lung cancer. This work could lead to studies wherein simultaneous blockade of
platelet/extracellular PP1cα along with immune check points may provide exclusive opportunities to optimize
cancer immunotherapy."

Inflammatory responses in the eye, such as following corneal wounding, and in autoimmune-mediated uveitis,
must be controlled and resolved to preserve homeostasis and prevent damage. In all these conditions, we
discovered that immune cells are recruited to the surface of the lens, many with characteristics associated with
immunomodulation. The central location of the lens and its interface with most eye tissues via the adjacent
aqueous and vitreous humors places it in the perfect position for these Lens Capsule Associated Immune
Cells (LC-AICs) to present antigens and produce proteins that can exert immunosuppressive functions across
the eye. In addition, we found that there are resident immune cells, the sentinels of the immune system, that
become integrated within the lens during development. We now build on these findings with studies aimed at
understanding the lineage and functions of lens resident immune cells and LC-AICs recruited from other ocular
sites, their roles in maintaining homeostasis, and whether their long-term persistence is linked to pathogenic
outcomes. In Aim 1, we will perform lineage tracing studies to determine their ontogeny. These studies will
reveal whether these immune cell populations are long-lived, self-renewing and embryonic yolk-sac derived, or
short-lived, bone marrow-derived typical of those recruited to tissues in response to injury and pathogenesis.
Since tissue resident immune cells are immediate responders to injury and pathogenesis, we will investigate
whether their activation in response to corneal wounding is linked to LC-AIC recruitment and regenerative
repair of the cornea. In Aim 2, we will perform a detailed analysis of the immunomodulatory properties of the
LC-AICs recruited to the lens post-corneal wounding and in uveitis. These studies will include a functional
analysis to directly link the LC-AICs to the suppression of T-cell activation. We also examine the anti-
inflammatory and anti-angiogenic properties of the bioactive matrix-derived molecules proteolytically released
by LC-AICs as they migrate within the lens capsule. Our studies of the LC-AICs strongly support their
important functions as immunomodulators in the eye, including our discovery that they persist integrated with
the lens surface during the resolution of inflammation in uveitic eyes. However, their long-term persistence at
the lens capsule surface beyond this time, and the ability of a subset to abrogate lens immune privilege and
infiltrate the lens, suggests that their prolonged presence could lead to pathological outcomes. In Aim 3, we will
determine the mechanisms by which LC-AICs cross the lens capsule to infiltrate the lens and their fate,
including whether they can be agents of cataractogenesis by becoming collagen I-producing myofibroblasts. In
addition, we will investigate the properties of the fibrillar network with which the LC-AICs maintained on the
surface of the lens become entwined, and to which the iris becomes attached at late stages of uveitis, which
could be linked to pathological outcomes of uveitis. Understanding these links could lead to new treatment
options for patients with ocular pathologies associated with chronic inflammation."
10734782,"Nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii have become a
major challenge in the treatment of immunocompromised individuals and patients with traumatic injuries. These
infections include ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related urinary tract infections and non-healing
wound infections that can ultimately lead to sepsis. Of significant concern is the increasing frequency of life-
threatening infections caused by drug resistant A baumannii, reinforcing the need for new therapeutic
approaches. Recent studies have shown that A. baumannii taxa are abundant in clinical environments and that
decreases in microbial diversity contribute to increased antimicrobial resistance. However, little is known about
the biological and physical interactions between Acinetobacter sp isolated from these environments.
Characterization of a growing collection of Acinetobacter isolates obtained directly from patients at the University
of Michigan Hospital System over a period of 5 years has identified “predator” strains of A. baumannii capable
of inhibiting the growth of susceptible (“prey”) Acinetobacter strains. This phenotype is manifested as a zone of
clearing of susceptible bacteria – embedded in soft agar - that emanates from centrally inoculated predator
strains. Crude extracts containing a novel peptide toxin belonging to the family of ribosomally synthesized and
posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) can be isolated from the predator and subsequently added to prey
strains resulting in cell contact-independent growth inhibition. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the
presence of the genes predicted to be required for the synthesis, modification, and secretion of this RiPP, a
novel peptide toxin, is relatively rare. Screening of our strain collection indicate that approximately 3 % carry the
genes and display the growth inhibition phenotype. Analysis of available sequences in the NCBI database
confirms the relatively scarceness of these genes. In contrast, several A. baumannii strains including multidrug
resistant A. baumannii isolates as well as strains of the species Acinetobacter pittii are sensitive to killing. The
primary objective of this study is to dissect these antagonistic interactions among Acinetobacter isolates. We aim
to determine the nature of the peptide toxin and its mechanism of secretion. In addition, experiments are
designed to reveal how the toxin enters susceptible strains and by what mechanism it inhibits their growth. These
studies will advance our understanding of the role of the toxin and have significant translational implications with
potential for precision drug therapy as the use of the toxin or variants thereof may represent a promising means
of combating infections caused by multi-drug resistant A. baumannii."

The ability to access complex target molecules with sustainable methodology is imperative to the development
of novel drugs, which will be necessary to treat antimicrobial resistance and emerging infectious diseases.1 Site-
selective oxidation reactions are fundamental to the current synthetic logic towards complex scaffolds and the
decoration of these cores, which is key to the development of novel drugs.2,3 Nature can use enzymes to impart
exquisite site-selectivity in oxidations based on the three-dimensional control exerted by the active site while
bringing a substrate and oxidant together. Taking inspiration from Nature, I plan to utilize flavin-dependent
monooxygenases to site-selectively oxidize a variety of non-native arenes and heteroarenes substrates (Aim 1),
which will allow access to novel building blocks, pharmaceuticals, and natural products and their derivatives.
The sequence space of flavin-dependent monooxygenases is vast, therefore, logically picking biocatalysts that
have improved, site-selectivity, yield, or substrate scope, requires a strategy. I plan to use sequence similarity
networks, (to visualize how similar sequences are), sequence alignments, (to probe amino acid changes
proximal to active sites), three-dimensional active site analysis, (to identify key amino acids and size of active
site), and docking studies, (to understand how a substrate interacts with an active site) (Aim 2). These techniques
can be used together to explain and predict trends in substrate scope, and site-selectivity. Ultimately, these
techniques will help me to logically choose biocatalysts that have improved properties such as expanded
substrate scope, divergent site-selectivity, or improved yield to strengthen the proposed oxidative method
development.
Together these aims will develop site-selective biocatalytic oxidation methods applicable to a variety of arene
and heteroarene substrates. This research will broadly impact biocatalysis investigations by developing a high
throughput platform for nonnative substrate screening across a family of enzymes, and informing what tools are
important for rationally choosing existing biocatalysts. Finally, the proposed site-selective oxidative method will
improve the ease and efficiency of synthesis and derivatization of molecules that are important to human health."
10886487,"Early-stage and late-stage retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) selectively generate retinal neurons in
discrete temporal windows over the course of retinal development. Müller glia (MG), and late-stage RPCs have
similar gene expression profiles and express many shared transcription factors (TFs) that repress proliferative
and neurogenic competence. Upon retinal injury, many of these TFs are downregulated in MG, while TFs that
drive reactive gliosis are upregulated. This process is necessary to activate neurogenic competence in fish and
amphibians. However, MG in mammals lack neurogenic competence, and TFs that maintain quiescence are
rapidly re-expressed following injury. We have identified key regulators of proliferative and neurogenic
competence in both RPCs and MG through multiomic analyses. I am now exploring the possibility that a single
AAV-based reagent can be used to reprogram MG to early-stage RPC-like cells that generate early-born
retinal cell types, including cone photoreceptors, in situ. I hypothesize that MG can be reprogrammed to gain
proliferative and neurogenic competence in mammals by disrupting the function of TFs that promote late-stage
RPC identity and are also expressed in adult MG. Furthermore, I anticipate that overexpression of TFs that
promote early-stage RPC identity in MG-derived progenitors may promote generation of early-born retinal cell
types (Fig 1B). Finally, by combining these overexpression and loss of function approaches with
overexpression of TFs that promote photoreceptor specification, I expect to be able to generate substantial
numbers of early-born cone photoreceptors. I propose two aims to address this hypothesis. Aim I: Alter retinal
development trajectory and reprogram adult MG using overexpression of full-length and dominant-negative
constructs of candidate TFs. Multiplexed single-cell (sc)RNA-seq analysis will be used to identify constructs
that promote proliferative and neurogenic competence in electroporated late-stage RPCs and transduced adult
MG. Immunohistochemistry will be used to validate findings from the scRNA-seq data. This aim will allow for
the functional characterization of TFs that regulate the transition between early and late stages of
developmental competence in RPCs, as well as the transition of MG from a quiescent to a neurogenic state.
This aim will also identify constructs that promote the production of early-born cell types, including cone
photoreceptors, in neonatal retinal explants and mature MG. Aim II: Overexpression of Prdm1 in
reprogrammed adult MG to drive cone photoreceptor formation. Prdm1 is selectively and strongly expressed in
photoreceptor precursors and stimulates photoreceptor differentiation. Overexpression of Prdm1 may induce
reprogrammed MG to produce early-stage RPC-like cells that are neurogenic and specifically generate mature
cone photoreceptors. This project has significant potential to contribute to the development of novel gene
therapies for photoreceptor dystrophies, including age-related macular degeneration, Stargardt's disease, and
retinitis pigmentosa."
10757893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is a primary risk factor for most chronic diseases. As the population of individuals over the age of 65
increases in the U.S., it is critical that we understand the molecular mechanisms that drive aging, with the goal
of delaying the onset of these chronic diseases. One of the “hallmarks of aging”, genomic instability, can occur
in the form of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which are lethal to cells unless resolved. In S. cerevisiae,
the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is especially unstable due to its repetitive nature, high levels of transcription, and a
major replication fork block site. We are using the rDNA as a tool for studying the initiating genome instability
events of aging in dividing cells. Instability at the rDNA significantly contributes to the replicative aging of yeast
cells. Our lab previously demonstrated age-induced depletion of several factors that maintain rDNA stability,
including Sir2 and cohesin. During early aging, chromatin association by these factors was reduced at the
rDNA locus, followed by later reduction at centromeres, a combination that resulted in chromosome instability.
To identify additional factors that contribute to aging-induced rDNA and chromosome instability, we performed
a proteomics screen on nuclei isolated from replicatively young and moderately aged yeast cells. This screen
revealed depletion of multiple proteins that control chromatin topology and remodeling, especially at the rDNA.
These included topoisomerases I and II, and the DNA helicase Rrm3. Taken together, we predict a model
where reduced capacity to resolve DNA torsional stress during early aging results in DSBs at the rDNA. We
hypothesize that the repetitive rDNA array and accumulating extrachromosomal rDNA circles then act as a
“sink” for diminished DNA stabilizers and repair enzymes later in aging, ultimately contributing to genome-wide
instability.
To test this model, I am using a genome-wide DSB mapping and sequencing protocol in young and
progressively aged cells, focusing on hotspot identification across multiple time-points (Aim1). In preliminary
experiments, I have optimized this method for yeast and confirmed the rDNA as a DSB hotspot, even in young
cells. I will also look for changes in distribution across lifespan of the key proteins identified in our proteomics
screen using ChIP-seq. Third, I will determine if aging sensitizes cells to DSB inducing agents. In Aim2 I will
determine if DSB accumulation in early aging can be rescued by re-expressing key age-depleted factors using
a titratable, doxycycline-inducible overexpression system. Second, I will determine if re-expression of the
candidate age-depleted proteins reduces rDNA stability or extends replicative lifespan. These experiments will
give insight into how genomic instability acts as a driver for the initiating events of aging."

Tendons can withstand large forces due to a highly aligned, dense collagen matrix. However, their low
cellularity and relative inability to recruit reparative cells post-injury, as well as susceptibility to excessive
scarring, results in loss of tendon structure and mechanical function. Type I collagen (Col1) is the primary
collagen of healthy tendon and type III collagen (Col3) is a minor constituent that increases in response to
injury. Persistently increased Col3 contributes to persistent fibrovascular scarring and structural and functional
deficits in the healing tendon. In perinatal tendons, Col3 is increased, similar to the injured state, compared to
healthy mature tendons. Unlike the healing response, the process of neonatal tendon development yields a
structurally and functionally superior tendon with a highly aligned Col1-dense matrix. Moreover, neonatal
developing tendon demonstrates improved efficiency and quality of healing compared to healing mature
tendon. Understanding the role of Col3 in the developmental and healing processes of the neonatal tendon will
increase our ability to recapitulate tendon development with tissue engineering and improve tendon injury
treatment. Therefore, our overall objective is to delineate the contribution of Col3 to development and healing
in the neonatal tendon through modulation of matrix properties and cellular activity. Specifically, we will test the
hypothesis that Col3 is crucial for early neonatal development but contributes less to regulation of development
at later time points as relative Col3 in the tendon decreases. We also hypothesize that the neonatal tendon has
enhanced capacity for a robust proliferative response to tendon injury which creates a Col3-dense healing
matrix favorable for tendon progenitor migration and differentiation to ultimately deposit aligned, Col1 fibrils
which restore tendon structure and function. To test these hypotheses, we generated a novel, inducible Col3
deficient mouse (i.e. Col3a1F/F) to temporally control Col3 reduction. The study aims are: Aim 1: Define the
temporal dynamics of the regulatory function(s) of Col3 during phases of neonatal tendon development and
Aim 2: Define the regulatory function(s) of Col3 during phases of neonatal healing. Viscoelastic mechanical
testing, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, gene expression, proteomics, and 11
integrin analyses will be used to assess the structural, mechanical, and compositional properties of tendons in
both aims. Insights gleaned from this work will be relevant to a variety of conditions that reduce Col3
expression including vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome, aging, smoking and menopause and will highlight
therapeutic targets for enhancing tendon injury treatment. The proposed work will be carried out in a world-
class training environment at the University of Pennsylvania’s McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory. This
environment combined with an expert sponsorship team, including experts in studies of tendon structure and
function as well as matrix biology, will fully support completion of this proposal and facilitate development into a
competent independent investigator capable of producing rigorous and reproducible clinically relevant work."

Epilepsy affects over 70 million people worldwide, including an estimated 3.4 million in the US. Multiple widely-
used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have off-target effects inducing key drug metabolizing enzymes, yielding
numerous potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs). One such interaction with particularly high real-world
relevance, but minimal clinical evidence, has been purported to occur between these enzyme-inducing AEDs
(EI-AEDs) and direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Co-prescription of AEDs with anticoagulants is
common due to the frequent concurrency and causal links between epilepsy and the main indications for DOACs.
EI-AEDs induce two crucial components of DOAC absorption and metabolism, which may lead to lower,
potentially sub-therapeutic, levels of DOACs, and an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Evidence for
these DDIs is composed primarily of in vitro and animal data. Existing human studies have limited real-world
applicability due to both: substantial inconsistencies in findings, and methods that put the research at high risk
for bias and confounding. Further, these human studies’ narrow focus on pairwise EI-AED/DOAC interactions
disregards the potential role of higher-order drug-drug-drug interactions (3DIs), particularly given the high
prevalence of polypharmacy in epilepsy populations. The goal of this research plan is to apply methodologically
rigorous designs and leverage large-scale administrative claims data to address knowledge gaps regarding real-
world DOAC therapeutic failures associated with EI-AED and concomitant drug interactions. In Aim 1, we will
use a retrospective incident user cohort design to compare thromboembolic event rates in adults with epilepsy
exposed to DOACs with EI-AEDs versus an active comparator group exposed to DOACs with non-enzyme
inducing AEDs (NEI-AEDs). Given critical differences in utilization and thrombotic risk, we will separately analyze
DOAC use for atrial fibrillation (1A) and deep vein thrombus/pulmonary embolism (1B). To generate effect
estimates with vigorous control for observed and unobserved confounders (via proxy-adjustment), data-adaptive
high-dimensional propensity scoring will be employed. In Aim 2, we will use a case-crossover design to explore
the role of 3DIs in thromboembolic events in adults with epilepsy prescribed EI-AEDs and DOACs. A novel within-
person approach to 3DI screening will be undertaken based on the temporal associations of concomitant drugs
with thromboembolic events. Estimates will be quantitatively compared to a negative case group prescribed NEI-
AEDs with DOACs in order to mitigate the direct effects and confounding by concomitant drugs, as well as to
differentiate 3DI from DDI signals. Overall, this research will contribute to the advancement of prescribing
standards for epilepsy patients requiring anticoagulation and provide benchmarks for future 3DI investigations.
The valuable skills and experiences gained from this mentor-guided research and training will serve as essential
foundations for the applicant to build continued postdoctoral research initiatives, and to advance towards a career
as an independent investigator-clinician specializing in neuroepidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology."

The demand for human donor tissue for treatment of corneal blindness far outpaces the supply, necessitating
an innovative bioengineered approach for corneal regeneration. However, current laboratory-made constructs
are insufficient due to lack of long-term transparency and underwhelming regenerative capacity. Recent studies
suggest that cell therapies using transplanted corneal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) help prevent corneal
scar formation and restore corneal transparency. To propel this strategy toward clinical translation, both an
effective cell delivery system and a precise understanding of their regenerative effects will be required. 3D
bioprinting—in which cells and matrix components are precisely patterned—is a promising technique for creating
customizable corneal constructs for implantation. We have previously demonstrated a versatile, cell-friendly 3D
bioprinting platform for corneal MSCs. In my proposed research, I will apply 3D bioprinting for bioorthogonally-
crosslinked collagen hydrogels with encapsulated human corneal MSCs to fabricate highly regenerative corneal
stroma-like constructs. This system will allow for control over the corneal MSC microenvironment to optimize
and leverage their regenerative potential. I specifically aim to overcome two common challenges in
bioengineered corneal tissue that both result in loss of transparency: (1) tissue contraction over time due to cell-
imposed forces, and (2) lack of cell and matrix organization that mimics the hierarchical structure of the native
corneal stroma. I will test the hypotheses that (Aim 1) crosslinking collagen hydrogels with a covalent
bioorthogonal chemistry increases stability against contraction from corneal MSCs without hindering their ability
to secrete pro-regenerative factors and (Aim 2) aligning the collagen fibril microstructure through 3D bioprinting
guides the organized deposition of nascent matrix to facilitate sustained transparency. These constructs will be
evaluated in vivo (Aim 3) in a rabbit keratectomy model to assess restoration of corneal thickness, stromal
integrity, and optical transparency; integration of the hydrogel into the host; re-epithelialization; surface
inflammation and scarring; and phenotype of the transplanted corneal MSCs. Together, these results will be
critical for understanding the effect of the surrounding 3D matrix on the regenerative capacity of corneal MSCs.
My training will be supported by Sarah Heilshorn, Ph.D. (Materials Science & Engineering), an expert on
biomaterials for regenerative medicine, and David Myung, M.D., Ph.D. (Ophthalmology), an attending physician
who specializes in corneal surgery and diseases of the eye. In addition to expanding my scientific technical skills,
my training plan includes development of mentorship, scientific writing, and presentation skills; training in
research ethics; and enhancement of collaboration skills through a series of on-campus courses, workshops and
seminars as well as off-campus conferences. Altogether, this research proposal will empower me to become an
independent, productive research scientist as I leverage the regenerative capacity of corneal MSCs for the
overarching goal of restoring vision on-demand to patients with corneal blindness."

10810797,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphoproliferative diseases primarily in immunocompromised patients. Like all herpesviruses, KSHV uses the host gene expression machinery to carefully control the timing and abundance of viral mRNAs in its latent and lytic phases. While emphasis has been placed on transcriptional control, recent reports suggest two distinct interactions between KSHV and host RNA quality control (QC) pathways that degrade nuclear transcripts. The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms at the interface of host nuclear RNA QC pathways and KSHV gene expression. The aims will define mechanisms that KSHV uses to protect from or exploit host RNA decay pathways. In addition, some of the host pathways remain poorly understood, so the viral mechanisms will be harnessed to uncover fundamental aspects of human molecular biology. In one pathway studied here, the host RNA QC machinery targets viral transcripts for nuclear decay. To protect its RNAs, the KSHV ORF57 protein counters that pathway likely through other host factors including an RNA-binding protein called ALYREF. In Aims 1 and 2 of the current proposal, the mechanisms of ORF57-mediated protection and the RNAs targeted by specific host factors will be determined in molecular detail. Interestingly, ALYREF and other ORF57 binding proteins are host mRNA export factors. In Aim 3, their proposed roles in viral RNA stability will be tested on host RNAs to determine whether they reflect a general activity of these proteins. In addition to protection from decay, KSHV has been reported to exploit the PABPN1-PAPα/γ mediated RNA decay (PPD) pathway to control temporal expression of late genes. Aim 4 of the current proposal seeks to define the mechanisms of PPD- mediated regulation of viral gene expression and to better define the components of the PPD pathway. Taken together, the proposed KSHV studies investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in nuclear RNA QC pathways to better understand the basic gene expression mechanisms of the human pathogen KSHV and its human host cell."

Physiological Role of De-differentiating Dermal Adipose Tissue
Adipose tissue fibrosis is an integral component of dysfunctional fat tissue. This fibrosis exerts detrimental
effects on local metabolic responses within adipose tissue, in addition to initiating maladaptive systemic
responses. The exact cause(s) of fibrosis in adipose tissue are still a matter of debate and as such, are not
well defined. Here, we aim to focus on “dermal adipose tissue fibrosis”, primarily due to its 1) ease of
accessibility, 2) our new genetic mouse models that we generated to specifically examine dermal
adipose tissue dysfunction and, 3) our initial observation that identified extensive dermal adipocyte
differentiation and de-differentiation. We believe that the latter processes are a key aspect of the
pathological road to adipose tissue fibrosis. Dermal adipose tissue is skin-associated fat located directly
under the reticular dermis. Compared to other well-defined fat pads, dermal adipose tissue displays a high
degree of plasticity. Under a variety of physiological conditions, dermal adipose tissue has the capacity to
either rapidly and locally expand, or reduce its volume. Our in vivo preliminary studies showed that dermal
adipose tissue is negatively associated with collagen production in skin fibroblasts. Importantly, more
recent studies in our laboratory identified that the highly dynamic nature of dermal adipocytes allows them
to 1) undergo de-differentiation into pre-adipocytes or, 2) convert into alpha-SMA-positive myofibroblasts
(when examined in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis model). Here, we propose to examine the following
hypothesis: that the adipocyte itself is the major player in preventing adipose tissue fibrosis in
response to a metabolic challenge of high fat diet feeding, or bleomycin induction. We will address our
hypothesis in three Specific Aims: I) We will retain fat cells in a fully differentiated state, by either ectopically
exposing dermal adipocytes to PPARgamma agonists. In parallel, we aim to genetically overexpress PPARgamma then
assess the impact on the fibrotic response. In addition to this, we will examine the impact of a complete
elimination of adipocytes upon the local fibrotic response in the skin. II) Through lineage tracing, we aim to
genetically label and track mature adipocytes as they de-differentiate into pre-adipocytes. Some of these pre-
adipocytes can convert to myofibroblasts. We have developed a genetic approach to selectively eliminate
myofibroblasts that originate from mature adipocytes. This will allow us, for the first time, to examine the
functional relevance of these adipocyte-derived myofibroblasts towards the fibrotic response in adipose tissue.
III) With a newly developed “Split Cre” system, we take advantage of a dual promoter system that ensures
expression uniquely in the dermal adipocyte. We will manipulate leptin and adiponectin levels locally, then
address the impact of local adipokine action in the microenvironment of the dermal adipose tissue on the
fibrotic response. While we focus on dermal adipose tissue, results from the proposed studies will also
have a profound impact on the understanding of the fibrotic response in other fat depots."

The Minnesota Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing,
population-based surveillance system designed to identify and monitor selected maternal
experiences and behaviors that occur before and during pregnancy and during the child’s early
infancy among a stratified sample of women delivering a live birth. The purpose of PRAMS is to
collect state-specific, population-based data on maternal and child health indicators of high
scientific quality to inform programs and policies relating to maternal and infant health. PRAMS
began as part of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiative to reduce infant
mortality and low birth weight. The objectives for PRAMS are: 1) to continue surveillance of
selected maternal attitudes, behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during, and after
pregnancy; 2) provide a high quality data source for ongoing monitoring of risk factors for
maternal and infant health; 3) to analyze and translate PRAMS data to inform planning and
evaluation of public health programs and policy; 4) to build capacity for collecting, analyzing
and translating data to address relevant maternal and infant health issues. Minnesota-specific
objectives include addressing the large disparities in pregnancy-related health that are masked
by the small size of Minnesota’s populations of color and American Indians and to provide
useful results to inform and influence public health planners throughout the state. Minnesota
PRAMS contributes to the mission of the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) “protecting,
maintaining and improving the health of all Minnesotans” by contributing to key MDH goals,
most importantly, that all Minnesotans are given a healthy start in life. Minnesota PRAMS
collects information from Minnesota-resident mothers who had a live birth in Minnesota within
the last three to six months. Mothers are selected using a monthly stratified, systematic sample
of recently filed birth certificates. Currently, U.S.-born African American and American Indian
women are oversampled as these are priority higher-risk populations. Mothers are offered the
survey by mail and later by telephone. The monthly samples are combined into an annual file,
weighted for non-response, non-coverage and sample design. Results from MN PRAMS are
used to provide weighted annual estimates of experiences and behaviors of Minnesota-resident
women who had a live birth in Minnesota that year."

Detection of mechanical stimuli is crucial for organisms' development and survival. Discriminating between an
innocuous mechanical stimulus and noxious mechanical force is vital to avoid tissue damage and resulting pain.
Cutaneous mechanisms of mechanical stimulus detection have received considerable attention, however, the
sensory neuron-specific mechanoreceptors underlying touch and pain are not fully understood. Piezo1 and
Piezo2 ion channels are bona fide mechanotransduction cation channels expressed at various levels and tissues
that comprise the peripheral nervous system, including keratinocytes and sensory neurons. While sensory
neuron expression of Piezo2 is essential for peripheral sensation of tactile stimuli, relatively little is known about
the role of its close relative, Piezo1. Despite early work suggesting dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons
display relatively robust Piezo2 expression and comparatively minimal Piezo1 expression, more recent evidence
suggests that Piezo1 is expressed by sensory neurons and it can be mechanically and pharmacologically
activated in these neurons. This suggests sensory neuron Piezo1 may be functionally important for detection of
tactile and mechanical pain by the somatosensory system. Furthermore, while sensory neuron Piezo2 is
implicated in mechanical allodynia, nothing is currently known about the contribution of sensory neuron Piezo1
to the mechanical allodynia or hyperalgesia characteristic of neuropathic or inflammatory pain conditions. In the
experiments outlined in the current proposal, I will use evoked behavioral assays, patch clamp electrophysiology,
and ex vivo skin-nerve recordings to determine the role Piezo1 plays in sensory neuron-mediated
mechanosensation in naïve (non-injury) and pain (injury) contexts by using transgenic mice with sensory neuron
specific deletion of Piezo1. In Aim 1, I will examine the contribution of sensory neuron-specific Piezo1 to
mechanosensation (Aim 1A), to mechanically-evoked peripheral fiber responses (Aim 1B), and to DRG
responses to mechanical stimuli (Aim 1C). Similar approaches will be used in Aim 2 to interrogate the role of
Piezo1 in mechanical hypersensitivity induced by inflammation, using complete Freund's adjuvant, and
peripheral neuropathy induced by spared tibial nerve injury. I will determine whether Piezo1 contributes to injury-
induced mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia (Aim 2A), and mechanical stimulus-induced sensitization of
peripheral fibers (Aim 2B) and DRG sensory neurons (Aim 3C). These studies will ultimately reveal additional
roles for mechanically-gated channels in tactile stimulus transduction. Overall, the proposed aims will reveal the
contribution of sensory neuron Piezo1 to detection of mechanical stimuli in non-injury and injury conditions,
potentially revealing new avenues for treatment of mechanical pain."

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is arguably one of the most devastating
Public Health crises of the last century. In the United States, African-Americans have been disproportionately
impacted, with overall rates of infection and mortality 2 to 4 times higher than those observed in Whites.
Additionally, as a direct result of closings of non-essential businesses and other entities, rates of
unemployment and underemployment have also surged, and African-Americans are significantly more likely
than Whites to report being underemployed or furloughed due to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, given racial
disparities in COVID-19 mortality, national polls have also found racial differences in reports of COVID-related
loss, with African-Americans more frequently reporting personally knowing someone who has died from
COVID-19 than Whites. Because of this, it has been argued that, as a result of COVID-19, African-
Americans are experiencing a “pandemic of stress” that will have a “dangerous impact” on their health
and well-being long after the virus itself has been contained. Leveraging our previously funded cohort that
assessed psychosocial stress and vascular aging in early middle-aged African-American women, we have an
unprecedented opportunity to examine the degree to which stressors resulting from, and related to,
the COVID-19 pandemic might impact vascular disease—the number 1 killer in the US-in this group.
Middle-aged African-American women may be a uniquely important group on which to focus, because: 1) they
have increasingly high, but poorly understood, rates of vascular disease relative to other race-gender groups;
and 2) the long-term impact of the widespread financial, employment and social stressors resulting from
COVID-19 might be particularly deleterious for African-American women, largely due to structural and
contextual inequalities that pre-dated the pandemic itself. The proposed project will examine linkages between
overall psychosocial stressors (debt, financial stress, job stress, interpersonal incivilities and mistreatment,
loneliness), COVID-specific stressors (COVID-related financial difficulties, COVID-specific parenting stressors,
COVID-related loss) and prospective changes in vascular aging (ambulatory blood pressure, arterial stiffness,
inflammation) over 24 months in a cohort of 350 middle-aged African-American women. Because we have
pre-COVID assessments of a range of psychosocial stressors, a major innovation of the proposed work is
our ability to examine how pre- versus post-COVID changes in exposure to overall psychosocial stress
might prospectively impact vascular aging. Importantly, we will capitalize on the considerable within-group
heterogeneity in our cohort, to examine whether any of our hypothesized associations are moderated by pre-
COVID assessed sociodemographic factors that might increase vulnerability (socioeconomic status, single
parenthood, marital status) or resilience (e.g., purpose in life, optimism, mastery, social support) to
psychosocial stress, in order to inform short- and long-term prevention efforts."

Aims, will be:
Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that Fmr1 regulates inhibitory synaptic connections in the bulb.
Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that Fmr1 regulates local network activity in the bulb by controlling inhibitory
synaptic connections.
Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that Fmr1 regulates olfactory behavior and bulbar oscillations in awake behaving
mice by controlling inhibitory synaptic connections.
 Our studies will utilize a variety of approaches including patch-clamp recordings in brain slices,
ultrastructural analyses, behavioral experiments, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings. Mouse models
will include whole-animal Fmr1 KO mice, which is the most widely used mouse model of FXS, along with
conditional KO and recovery mice in which Fmr1 expression is selectively and inducibly manipulated in
GAD65-expressing GABAergic interneurons. This multidisciplinary approach will enable us to identify
dysfunction in olfaction that results from altered Fmr1 expression at levels ranging from single synapses to
whole-animal behavior and also link the changes observed at the different levels."
10808930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Caring for an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) patient is a significant responsibility,
involving a commitment to be available 24/7 up to at least 100 days post-transplant to provide emotional and
physical support. Informal family caregivers of HCT patients often experience significant role changes that can
conflict with other responsibilities (e.g., work, child rearing). Caregivers often report high burden and poor
mental health, which can have an adverse impact on patient health outcomes, including increased anxiety,
depression, and decreased patient survival. However, some research suggests that caregivers may benefit
when they receive adequate support and when given the opportunity for growth and meaning-making. Despite
this, few comprehensive and proactive caregiver support programs exist. Mindfulness facilitates the ability to
shift attention to experiences purposefully, with a sense of acceptance (as opposed to trying to change or react
to it). Active mechanisms of mindfulness (e.g., improved attention, emotion regulation, decentering) combined
with the unique circumstances of HCT caregivers, suggest that approaching thoughts/emotions/sensations via
mindfulness may convey benefits above and beyond what is found in other treatment approaches. Our multi-
disciplinary team systematically developed a 6-week mindfulness-based intervention for allogeneic HCT
caregivers – FOCUS (Focusing On mindfulness for Caregivers Under Stress). FOCUS spans the course of
patient treatment, with session 1 occurring prior to transplant, sessions 2-3 taking place immediately following
transplant, and sessions 4-6 occurring post-discharge. Pilot testing revealed that FOCUS was highly feasible
and acceptable for allogeneic HCT caregivers and useful for managing stress. Significant decreases in
negative affect and increases in mindfulness, post traumatic growth, and mental health symptoms were
observed from baseline to end of treatment; findings were maintained through the 1-month follow-up. This
project builds on our pilot study by randomizing caregivers (N=270) to one of three treatment conditions:
FOCUS, Healthy Living (HL), and Usual Care (UC). This three-arm design will allow us to rigorously test if
FOCUS is more efficacious than both HL (attention placebo condition matched to FOCUS on time and contact)
and UC (attention control condition). Self-report assessments will occur at baseline, end of treatment, and 2-
and 6-months post-treatment. Biomarker data will be collected via hair cortisol concentrations, and daily diaries
will assess fluctuating variables (e.g., affect, state mindfulness). We anticipate mindfulness to ultimately reduce
caregiver burden (primary outcome) via measured mechanisms (e.g., reduced stress). We expect patient
distress and healthcare utilization to be both directly and indirectly impacted via caregiver participation in
FOCUS. This proposal aligns with a recent call from NIH to develop and test interventions for cancer
caregivers that also improve patient health outcomes. If ultimately proven efficacious, future research includes
plans for dissemination/implementation, as well as extension to other cancer caregiver populations."

For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs)
are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component
of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics
of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the
decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments
to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop-
ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems
to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot
clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004.
We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this
simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes,
and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build
the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF
tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which
can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from
human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human
controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a
particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this
problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through
reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control
the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts
BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all,
enabling widespread development of BMIs."
10840320,"ABSTRACT
Earlier recognition of sepsis and improved implementation of best practices have significantly reduced in-hospital
mortality over the past decade. As in-hospital survival has improved, the number of patients who do not fully
recover has dramatically increased; nearly 50% of surgical sepsis patients will never fully recover and nearly
one-third of these patients will die within 6 months. Currently, one important critical question that vexes medical
practitioners is: why do some surgical sepsis patients rapidly recover while others have poor long-term outcomes
despite our best supportive efforts? Why are some of our comorbid (i.e. cancer, end-stage renal disease, etc.)
populations at increased risk of nonrecovery? Our overarching hypothesis is that the consequences of
surgical sepsis (death and poor quality of life) are the result of an unresolving host leukocyte dyscrasia,
similar to other chronic conditions such as cancer and autoimmune disease. Specifically, the
preferential expansion and self-perpetuation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), propagated
in part through epigenetic changes in both bone marrow (BM) progenitors and MDSCs, drives non-acute
infectious and noninfectious complications after sepsis. This Program will investigate in human surgical
sepsis the underlying mechanisms that drive ‘dysfunctional myelopoiesis’, expansion of MDSC populations,
suppressed T-cell quantities/function, and the development of patient’s immunosuppressive/inflammatory
endotypes. We will primarily focus on how MDSC expansion evolves over time in surgical sepsis patients who
do or do not rapidly recover; how myelopoiesis is regulated transcriptionally and epigenetically in the bone
marrow of trauma patients who are at high risk of developing sepsis. There are four specific aims: Aim 1. To test
the hypothesis that perpetuation of host MDSCs after acute surgical sepsis drives poor long-term clinical
outcomes in surgical sepsis, including but not limited to increased secondary infections. Aim 2. To test the
hypothesis that failure to recover from surgical sepsis is driven by modifiable epigenetic alterations in circulating
MDSCs that induce and prolong immunosuppressive endotypes. Aim 3. To identify the distinct
immunosuppressive mechanisms of MDSCs from surgical sepsis patients over time, including
immunometabolism, check-point inhibition, reactive oxygen and nitrogen production, and substrate availability.
Aim 4. To test the hypothesis that in response to an initial inflammatory stimulus, the increased risk of developing
surgical sepsis is secondary to immunosuppression driven by a preferential bone marrow hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) expansion of MDSCs transcriptionally and epigenetically. This will be analyzed in severe blunt trauma
patients at high risk for post-injury sepsis who manifest early changes in bone marrow progenitors and expansion
of immunosuppressive MDSCs. Using the established clinical infrastructure of the Sepsis and Critical Illness
Research Center (SCIRC), a team science approach will be employed with collaborating PI’s coming from
multiple clinical and basic science disciplines. Ongoing regular biweekly meetings currently address program,
resource and professional development, as well as time and effort allocation and conflict resolution."

To what extent is adaptive evolution predictable? Despite its importance in understanding the biology of human diseases,
including the evolution of viral and bacterial pathogens, the dynamics of genetic adaptation are still poorly understood. In
particular, few examples yet exist that have been dissected to the molecular level. Examples of adaptations from natural
systems and the use of model organisms are powerful tools that can be combined to make progress on this difficult
question. We have employed instances of “parallel evolution”, involving assemblages of species experiencing a common
regime of natural selection, to evaluate multiple outcomes of the process of adaptation. With this information, we can
learn about recurrent features of adaptation and infer constraints and regularities in the adaptive process. Our work
focused on the biomedically-important interaction between Na+,K+-ATPases and their regulatory steroidal-glycosides that
a large variety of plants and animals use as toxins to defend themselves from being eaten. Using a diverse set of animals
that have independently evolved resistance to steroidal-glycoside toxicity, including insects and vertebrates, we
discovered these diverse species most often evolve resistance via a small number of possible options (i.e. involving only
three of 41 possible sites in the protein that could be modified to confer resistance). These findings suggest that adaptive
evolution is often path-dependent, implying that the individual components of an adaptation must evolve in a prescribed,
and ultimately predictable, order. They also raise numerous questions about the nature of this path dependency, including
the extent to which it emerges from interactions among residues within a protein, or from the genomic background of the
species; whether it similarly constrains adaptation over short and longer time scales, and how generally it applies in
adaptive protein evolution. Here we propose three aims that address these questions, by combining approaches from
evolutionary genomics and molecular genetics. In Aim 1, we will use genome engineering in Drosophila to elucidate the
path dependence of the steroidal-glycoside resistance adaptation both at the level of its primary target (Na+,K+-ATPase)
and at the level of the whole genome. In Aim 2, we will determine which and how many genomic factors contribute to
naturally occurring variation within Drosophila populations. This information will reveal the relationship between within-
population and between-species genetic variation underlying the same trait, connecting short- and long-term dynamics of
the adaptive process. In Aim 3, we will use principles learned from molecular adaptation at Na+,K+-ATPase to
computationally predict and use genome engineering to functionally validate path dependent adaptation dynamics in
Drosophila for a diverse group of proteins, many of which (like Na+,K+-ATPase) have important roles in neurological
development and homeostasis. Together this work will greatly increase our understanding of the constraints on adaptive
protein evolution and the predictability of the genetic changes by which novel phenotypes emerge."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative condition that impacts 44 million people globally.
It is the most common cause of dementia—accounting for 80% of all dementia diagnoses—and predominantly
affects older people. To date, AD has no cure. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose patients as early as possible to
maximize the efficacy of symptom management strategies. However, existing AD diagnostic and monitoring
options remain subpar, leaving urgent need for sensitive, reliable, and convenient methods to measure AD.
New research suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) -based biomarkers can assess neural degeneration
caused by AD long before tissue loss or behavioral symptoms appear. SPARK Neuro aims to unlock the full
potential of EEG through a novel software platform: SPARK Scan. Combining EEG with the capabilities of
machine learning, SPARK Scan better assesses cognitive health and neurodegeneration, aiding the diagnosis
of AD. In the proposed Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, the company will enhance the existing SPARK platform
by developing a novel Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology Index that tracks patient amyloid and tau burden.
Developed with CSF data collected from Johns Hopkins University, the Pathology Index will be a continuous
score that corresponds to a patient’s pathological disease burden. After updating the software, the SPARK team
will employ Human Factors testing to enhance the usability and utility of the updated platform and clinical report
before submitting findings for FDA De Novo approval. This work will progress the SPARK platform by providing
a granular measure of AD-related pathology, extending beyond current capabilities."

The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrhea and death in immunocompromised
individuals and malnourished children globally. Control of Cryptosporidium requires CD4+ T cells and the
cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ), however there are signiﬁcant gaps in our understanding of the regulation of T cell
responses against the parasite. This is in large part due to diﬃculties analyzing T cell populations in the gut.
By engineering Cryptosporidium to express MHCII-restricted model antigens, I can identify parasite-speciﬁc
CD4+ T cells within the gut. Using this system, I have found that CD4+ T cell responses require type 1
conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) despite their better-studied role in CD8+ rather than CD4+ T cell
responses. In addition, I have found evidence for a Th17 response elicited by infection, pointing to an IFN-γ-
independent but T cell-dependent mechanism of control of the parasite that has remained elusive. I will utilize
a combination of novel transgenic parasites, genetic mouse models, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-
dimensional ﬂow cytometry to test which cDC subset(s) are required for CD4+ T cell responses to
Cryptosporidium (SA1), and to investigate the IFN-γ-independent, CD4+ T cell-dependent mechanism(s) of
control with a focus on Th17 responses (SA2). These studies will provide an opportunity to train in cross-
disciplinary approaches in parasitology and immunology to better understand how immunity to infection in the
gut is regulated. The studies proposed here will impact our fundamental understanding of mucosal
immunology and drive treatment and prevention for an important source of childhood mortality."

Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the sensory cortices is an emerging approach to restore sensation to
people who have lost it due to neurological injury or disease. ICMS of somatosensory cortex has been used in
clinical trials to restore sensation to the hands of people with spinal cord injury and, more recently, was used to
restore vision to a person with blindness. The sensations evoked by ICMS are dependent on the stimulated
electrode and selected parameters. Differences in perception of ICMS are likely the result of differences in the
structure of the recruited circuit. Two inhibitory subtypes, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM), have
recently been shown to play important but often opposing roles in sensory circuits. Understanding the
neurophysiology of somatosensory cortex and how this affects neural recruitment by ICMS is important for both
basic sensory neuroscience and for clinical approaches. With an improved understanding of the underlying
neurophysiology and how it is affected by stimulation, we can create better technologies for brain stimulation
and improve clinical outcomes. Studying neural mechanisms of ICMS evoked activity is difficult in humans due
to limitations in imaging capabilities and current hardware. Mouse models allow for high-resolution imaging of
neural activity in the brain and labeling of specific neuronal types through transgenic lines. I will study
mechanisms of ICMS in mouse somatosensory cortex using two-photon microscopy in transgenic mice with
fluorescent labeling to measure the activation of excitatory, PV, and SOM neurons. This approach will allow me
to measure the activation of the underlying neural circuits by ICMS using high-resolution imaging. In the first
specific aim, I will investigate how stimulus amplitude and frequency of ICMS together affect the intensity of
cortical activation. I expect that at lower amplitudes, responses will be more homogenous due to a decrease in
distant and SOM neuron recruitment. In the second specific aim, I will measure the intensity of evoked activity
in response to different ICMS frequencies across cortex. I expect that responses will vary across cortex based
on the recruitment of PV and SOM neurons. The goals of this proposal align with multiple priorities of the BRAIN
initiative, including understanding cell types and their role in health and disease, understanding neural circuits
underlying cortical function, applying methods for large scale neural recording, and interrogating the brain with
interventional tools. The proposed training and research experience will prepare me to use techniques, including
genetic labeling, two-photon microscopy, and combined in vivo animal electrophysiology, that will complement
my graduate work in human electrophysiology to develop me into an independent scientist who can study
stimulation therapies in the brains of both animals and humans to advance the goals of the BRAIN initiative."
10824373,"More than 80% of adults aged 65 and older in the United States have at least one chronic health condition.
Racial and ethnic minorities suffer more. They often lack high quality care and use hospitals and emergency
departments (EDs) for routine care. Where minorities reside and receive care contribute to health disparities.
They often live in disadvantaged neighborhoods, and social determinants of health (SDoH) lead to disparities.
Minorities also get care in low quality healthcare settings. Health disparities will further widen due to primary
care physician shortages. The growing nurse practitioner (NP) workforce can help reduce health disparities as
NPs disproportionately care for minorities. Yet, practices employing NPs (i.e., NP practices) are often located
in underserved communities and face major structural (e.g., lack of registries) and organizational (e.g., poor
care environments) challenges. The study’s overarching aim is to understand ways in which NP practices
could be leveraged to address SDoH and reduce health disparities. Building on our prior work, we will conduct
the first national mixed-methods study using multilevel models, geographic information system, and a positive-
deviance approach to achieve the aims: Aim 1. Investigate the impact of SDoH (i.e., economic stability,
education, built environment, health care access, and social context) on racial and ethnic disparities in quality
of care processes (e.g., HbA1c testing for diabetes) and outcomes (i.e., ED use, hospitalizations) among
chronically older adults receiving care in NP practices). Aim 2. Assess the extent to which NP practice
attributes (i.e., care environment, structural capabilities) moderate the impact of SDoH on racial and ethnic
disparities in quality of care processes and patient outcomes. Aim 3. Explore barriers and facilitators to
addressing SDoH and health disparities in NP practices with varying care environments and structural
capabilities. We will use existing data on neighborhoods and chronically ill Medicare patients cared for by NPs
in 2021-2022 in minority- and non-minority serving and integrated NP practices (n=2,400). We will also survey
NPs (n=6,960) in these practices on their care environments and structural capabilities using mail and online
methods. All data about patients, neighborhoods, NPs, and practices will be merged and analyzed in multilevel
models. We will also identify practices with favorable and unfavorable care environments and structural
capabilities and interview NPs and practice managers using positive-deviance methods. We will conduct
individual telephone/online interviews with ~50 NPs and ~50 practice managers from practices with favorable
and ~35 NPs and ~35 managers from practices with unfavorable attributes. The interviews will be recorded
and transcribed for content analysis. We will identify modifiable factors in practices to address SDoH. In all
study aims, we will oversample minority-serving NP practices. Our quantitative and qualitative findings will be
triangulated to inform administrators and policymakers seeking ways to leverage NP practices to address
SDoH and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities through practice, policy, and neighborhood interventions."

Difficulties with emotion expression and social behavior characterize multiple psychiatric conditions and
negatively impact child development. However, existing measurement tools for indexing social-emotional
function are imprecise and subjective, or require specialized training that is costly and time-intensive, prohibiting
widespread implementation. The imprecision of existing tools has a major negative impact not only on research,
but on the ability to assess and treat individuals with mental health concerns – especially among underserved
and under-resourced populations. Here, we propose to address this problem by quantifying social and emotional
behavior using novel biobehavioral markers derived from computer vision (facial expression analysis) and
computational linguistics (social/sentiment analysis). Our team has successfully used these markers to predict
the presence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with 91% accuracy. In this proposal, we determine the extent
to which our markers can serve as continuous measures of social behavior and negative emotion to advance
clinical phenotyping and interventions. The proposal brings together two high-bandwidth clinical research
programs at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Baylor College of Medicine to collect data on 750
adolescents (ages 12-17 inclusive) with ASD, a primary anxiety or depressive disorder, or without any
developmental/psychiatric condition. At a single assessment, all youth will participate in an extensive clinical
phenotyping battery consisting of validated clinical interviews and child-/parent-report scales assessing
converging and diverging mental health constructs, and three tasks eliciting positive/negative emotion, social
stress, and mild frustration. A subsample of 150 adolescents will be reassessed 6-10 weeks later to allow
retest/stability analyses. A novel camera apparatus will capture naturalistic synchronized verbal and nonverbal
signals from dyads. Our analytic approach combines state-of-the-art machine learning, computational linguistics,
and computer vision – including facial emotion recognition methods that rival several commonly used
alternatives. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop valid and objective measures of the Social and
Negative Valence Systems using novel biobehavioral markers in a large transdiagnostic sample of youth.
Secondary goals are to develop easy-to-follow methods to widely disseminate our tools and procedures, and to
characterize individual variability in these key RDoC metrics by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis. The
achievement of these goals will provide researchers with sorely needed measures of social and emotional
behavior, and provide clinicians with a new set of tools for identifying and tracking youth in need of mental health
treatment."

My research is focused on two different areas of gene regulation within the context of developmental biology.
One area concerns the molecular mechanisms and functions of non-coding RNAs. Long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are the most ubiquitous of non-coding RNAs, with tens of thousands annotated in the human
genome. Yet, they are also the most poorly understood non-coding RNA, as only a small fraction of annotated
lncRNAs have been characterized at a mechanistic level. Therefore, it is important to obtain a basic
understanding of how these RNAs work, how they are regulated, and what broad biological functions they
have. We focus on studying these questions in the model organism Drosophila because the mechanisms and
regulation thus far discovered in flies are highly similar to humans. The rich genetics of Drosophila enable
functional experiments that would not be possible in mammals. This award will support our efforts to discover
new principles of lncRNA regulation and flush out necessary detailed information about previous discoveries.
The second area concerns the interplay between gene regulatory programs and extrinsic inputs such as cell
metabolism, cell morphogenesis, and physically-based processes. We combine mathematical modeling and
quantitative experiments in Drosophila to define the links between these extrinsic inputs and gene regulation.
We generate substantial technical advances in quantitative approaches including (1) new high dimensional
biological datasets across spatial (cellular to organism) and temporal scales, (2) new conceptual models of
diverse developmental processes, and (3) mathematical models that describe developmental emergence.
Future directions include understanding whether redundant gene activation is a common feature of life
because it affords greater flexibility to regulatory programs to faithfully couple with cellular energy metabolism.
Another direction concerns the inherent stochasticity in biochemical reactions and how that affects the fidelity
of cell differentiation and patterning. Another future direction is to adapt our proven approaches to explore how
mechanical forces experienced by cells within tissues cause changes in their gene expression programs.
Understanding the biophysical nature of tissues will have great benefit for tissue engineering."

Mapping spatiotemporal variation in the burden of infectious diseases is critical for targeting interventions like
vaccines and prioritizing at-risk populations, particularly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), where
such diseases are most prevalent. While many priority pathogens have been mapped over entire endemic
regions, enteric infectious diseases (EIDs) have not, due to a perception that the necessary spatially referenced
data on their prevalence and environmental determinants are not available. However, improvements in
differential diagnosis of EIDs, geostatistical methods, and accessibility and accuracy of environmental data mean
that it is now possible to carry out such a mapping. The long-term goal of this proposal is to provide the research
and stakeholder community with an evidence base for the geographical targeting of enteropathogen-specific
child health interventions such as novel vaccines. The overall objective is to apply a big data approach to the
modeling of EIDs in combination with advanced geostatistical analyses and global earth observation (EO)-
derived datasets, resulting in generalizable estimates of the geographical distribution of these outcomes and of
their associations with environmental drivers disseminated via an interactive web-based dashboard. The central
hypothesis is that the prevalence of many enteropathogens varies spatiotemporally as a function of climatic,
environmental, and socio-demographic factors in a way that can be modelled using global EO datasets and
similar products. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that it will enable the identification of target
populations for interventions. Specifically, building on existing partnerships between epidemiologists,
climatologists, and hydrologists as well as investigators in numerous LMICs, Dr. Colston will: 1) compile and
maintain a large database of georeferenced results from studies that diagnosed EIDs in children in LMICs; 2)
Apply geostatistical models to EID outcome data (aim 1) and spatiotemporally matched, high resolution
environmental covariates to a). draw inferences about underlying biological processes and b). generate
prediction maps to identify geographical foci of transmission risk. 3) Establish a Planetary Child Health
Observatory (PCHO), an interinstitutional initiative consisting of a). an interactive web-based dashboard and b).
an international consortium of investigators. In addition to these research activities, Dr. Colston proposes a
career development plan that includes mentorship, experiential and peer-to-peer learning, coursework,
publications, and presentations with the objectives of: 1) gaining skills and formal training in geostatistical
inference, biostatistics, and large datasets; 2) expanding expertise in applications of environmental and remote
sensing-derived datasets in health research; 3) transitioning to research independence by securing follow-on
R01 funding. His proposal will be supervised by an outstanding, interdisciplinary mentoring team with
complementary methodological and substantive skills. The project will have a positive impact on public health by
providing data inputs urgently needed for targeting EID interventions to priority populations in LMICs."

Sepsis and severe trauma are linked with challenging clinical trajectories as well as dismal long-term outcomes
following hospital discharge. In surgical intensive care units (SICUs), an alarming percentage of sepsis and
trauma patients can develop chronic critical illness (CCI; prolonged acute-care and chronic-care hospitalization
with unresolved organ dysfunction). CCI frequently manifests as a persistent inflammation, immunosuppression
and catabolism syndrome (PICS). SICU survivors suffering from PICS have repeat infections, poor cognitive
performance, physical dysfunction and self-reported poor quality of life. These conditions, at least in part, are
due to an unresolving pathologic myelopoiesis and ensuing prevalence of distinct myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs). The principal investigator (PI) and his collaborators have demonstrated significant productivity
over the last decade, especially in the last five years, in this research field. The PI’s laboratory has conducted
human and murine research to establish that enhanced production of these distinct MDSCs is associated with
poor outcomes in sepsis and trauma. The laboratory has also discovered key distinctions in these MDSCs’
accompanying pathologic myeloid activation; for example, they are potently immunosuppressive towards
macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; while concurrently, they produce inflammatory cytokines, reactive nitric
oxide (NO), oxidation and peroxidation products that damage parenchymal cells and promote inflammation. We
hypothesize that microRNAs and immunometabolism affect each other in relation to the development and
suppressive activity of these MDSCs. Our overarching goal for this application is to build upon this foundation
and expand our understanding of the patient immune response to trauma and sepsis, including rationally
designing prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions aimed at treating or preventing grim clinical trajectories
and long-term outcomes following sepsis or trauma. This includes identifying sepsis and trauma patient
populations at risk of dying or having long-term morbidity. We intend: (1) to examine specific mechanisms,
including epigenetic and metabolic changes, to MDSC pathophysiology that engender or maintain pathologic
myeloid activation. MDSC and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) studies will be both descriptive
and interventional (ex vivo). For example, MDSCs will undergo phenotypic analysis as well as CITE-seq using
10X Genomics, and HSPCs isolated from bone marrow and blood will undergo phenotypic and functional
analysis. With these studies, we will (2) explore the unique biology of pathologic myeloid cell activation in different
cohorts of sepsis and trauma patients (such as different patient age and sex groups); and (3) consider possible
immunomodulative therapies that affect MDSCs and/or pathologic myeloid activation to mitigate or prevent
CCI/PICS. This MIRA would support and enable the PI and his laboratory to determine why sepsis and trauma
patients enter pathologic myeloid activation, and how to work towards resolving this to improve patient outcomes."

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis is a hallmark
of CVD and underlies many adverse events. Increased dietary lipid intake is a major contributor to the increased
CVD disease burden. Elevated plasma lipids, particularly in the form of LDL cholesterol, accelerate
atherosclerosis, the major cause of CVD. Emerging evidence suggests that other lipids, such as triglycerides
(TAG), play a role in the development of CVD, independent of LDL cholesterol. To date, lipid lowering therapies
have mostly focused on lowering LDL cholesterol, yet adverse events continue to rise. In this application we put
forth the framework and hypothesis that modulating bile acids, the body’s natural detergents, can be protective
against the onset of atherosclerosis. Dietary lipids such as TAG and cholesterol ester (CE) are insoluble and
require detergents (bile acids) for absorption. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. There are
many different bile acids which differ in their chemical structure which results in different properties as detergents
and also as signaling molecules. Therefore, the liver is a central hub that coordinately regulates the bile acids,
and by extension, the metabolism of many nutrients, including lipids. We have developed a central hypothesis
that lipid absorption is regulated by the type and amount of bile acid that is secreted into the intestine following
a meal. We hypothesize that bile acids are the key conduits that drive a gut-liver communication axis to regulate
lipid absorption. We have selectively targeted enzymes in the bile acid synthetic pathway to elicit specific
changes to bile acid levels, allowing us to study how changes in bile acid levels and composition alter lipid
absorption in vivo. While much has been studied in recent years about bile acid signaling, the role of bile acids
as detergents that facilitate the absorption of different dietary lipid species has been less well studied. To
determine how bile acids alter the absorption of different lipids, we have developed and validated a novel AAV-
CRISPR strategy to disrupt specific bile acid metabolism genes exclusively in the liver of adult mice. We have
also established a non-invasive and quantitative mass spectrometry approach to measure the absorption of
different dietary fatty acids in the intestine. Using these tools, we show that specific modulations in the total
amount and/or composition of bile acids have profound effects on fatty acid absorption and atherosclerosis
progression. Furthermore, we show that specific changes in bile acids can further accelerate and exacerbate
atherosclerosis. We have designed two specific aims to test the hypothesis that defined changes in bile acids,
mediated by specific disruption of enzymes of the bile acid synthesis pathway are protective against
atherosclerosis. Completion of these studies will further our understanding of the role of bile acids as detergents
and implicate bile acid metabolism as an important contributor in the pathogenesis atherosclerosis and CVD."

Hemoglobin disorders, such as sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, comprise the most common monogenic
diseases of the world and yet, current treatments remain largely supportive and inadequate. Induction of fetal
hemoglobin (HbF) could bypass the fundamental genetic defects of adult hemoglobin that cause these
diseases. Recent gene therapy successes provide proof-of-concept that understanding the molecular control of
adult-stage HbF silencing can identify rational therapeutic targets. However, gene therapy cannot be scaled up
globally to match the scope of the clinical problem for the foreseeable future. Therefore, novel
pharmacotherapies are needed to induce HbF. The major HbF regulators BCL11A, ZBTB7A, and NuRD each
have on-target liabilities that could make therapeutic targeting challenging. Recently ZNF410 was discovered
to be a novel transcriptional repressor of HbF level during adult-stage erythropoiesis. ZNF410 has a narrow
biological action, which is to enhance the expression of CHD4. CHD4 possesses a unique array of 27
reiterated ZNF410 binding motifs at its promoter and upstream enhancer, an assemblage without comparison
in the rest of the genome. This study aims to investigate the: mechanisms whereby ZNF410 controls the
expression of CHD4 through homotypic motif clusters; requirements for ZNF410 and its orthologs throughout
development, homeostasis and hematopoiesis; and potential of targeted protein degradation of ZNF410 by
IMiD congeners as a therapeutic approach. Near-term goals are to define the role of protein-level cooperativity
and chromatin accessibility in binding to CHD4 by ZNF410 and the relationship between ZNF410 binding
events and CHD4 expression. These mechanistic studies will help identify vulnerabilities in this regulatory axis
that might be targeted therapeutically. Furthermore, the roles of ZNF410 throughout mouse development and
adulthood as well as in human hematopoiesis will be investigated. Constitutive and conditional alleles of
Zfp410 and its cognate regulatory elements at Chd4 in mice will be generated and characterized.
Requirements for ZNF410 throughout human erythropoiesis and hematopoiesis will be identified by bulk and
single cell gene expression and chromatin profiling in vitro and in vivo. Finally, tool compounds will be
generated to validate targeted protein degradation of ZNF410 by small molecules as a promising therapeutic
approach. Structural evaluation and systematic exploration of structure-activity relationships will be leveraged
to obtain instructive compounds to evaluate in ZNF410/Zfp410 sufficient and deficient cellular and animal
models the therapeutic premise that ZNF410 is a favorable therapeutic target for HbF induction in the β-
hemoglobinopathies. The long-term goal is to promote the development of drug-like small molecules that
ultimately could be used in clinical trials."

Decades of research have established that gene expression in the nervous system is highly specific and
dynamic. Different types of neurons express dramatically different genes and process RNAs to generate
different isoforms. At each developmental stage, neurons express complements of RNA that together drive
them along appropriate trajectories toward their ultimate fate. Similarly, in mature neurons, differential gene
expression and processing are key determinants of structure, function, and disease susceptibility. However,
although these phenomena are well established, a deep and broad analysis—involving genome-wide, nervous
system-wide data—is not available for any organism. Ideally one would like to know, across all neuron types
and all developmental stages, exactly how the genome is transcribed and processed into functional RNAs.
Such detailed and complete knowledge of differential gene expression within the nervous system would help
elucidate the logic and cellular mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity. Further, by comparing dynamic
differential gene expression across different sexes in all neuron types, the genetic basis of neuronal sexual
dimorphism can be elucidated. The C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN) project
is a multi-lab consortium with the goal of understanding gene expression in the C. elegans nervous system.
Here, using a variety of RNAseq approaches, we propose to understand gene expression as neurons
differentiate and acquire sexual dimorphisms for every neuron type in the C. elegans nervous system, with
these Aims: Aim 1) Build and analyze a gene expression atlas for every neuron type at each stage of the
developmental lineage. Aim 2) Develop a gene expression atlas across sexes, identifying sexually dimorphic
gene expression in sex-shared neurons, as well as gene expression in sex-specific neurons. Aim 3) Describe
splicing patterns for all genes and all neuron types, and use this information to identify all instances of
differential alternative splicing. Aim 4) Generate and distribute analysis tools and data to the scientific
community. CeNGEN represents a paradigmatic advance in neurogenetics, and provides a unique opportunity
to elucidate the global control of neuron-specific gene expression and to relate developmental gene expression
and splicing to ultimate neuronal wiring and function. CeNGEN will also serve as a resource for future studies
in C. elegans neuroscience, and will provide a framework for addressing global differential gene expression in
more complex nervous systems that are currently not amenable to this comprehensive approach."

The goal of this proposal is to understand how transmembrane protein 164 (TMEM164) attenuates
polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and ferroptotic signaling. Ferroptosis is a novel iron-dependent
form of cell death implicated in a broad range of human diseases, including cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). In T2DM, the severity of diabetic state increases risk for renal tubular injury related to iron overload and
lipid peroxidation, two key features of ferroptosis. Characterizing enzymes that regulate the PUFA content of
human cells would not only deepen our understanding of ferroptosis, but also identify therapeutic targets for
treating diseases like T2DM where this form of cell death is dysregulated. Recent genome editing screens have
identified TMEM164, a multi-pass transmembrane protein of uncharacterized function, as a key regulator of
ferroptosis. We hypothesize, based on its Alphafold-predicted structure, that TMEM164 is a novel type of
cysteine-dependent transmembrane enzyme that regulates cellular PUFA content. Here we seek to test this
hypothesis and identify the specific enzymatic functions performed by TMEM164 in PUFA lipid metabolism, as
well as their contribution to conferring ferroptosis sensitivity to human cells. In Aim 1, I will determine the lipid
profiles of cells genetically deleted for TMEM164 and test whether wild type, but not a putative catalytic cysteine
mutant form of TMEM164 can rescue these lipid perturbations. From these data, I will define candidate
physiological substrates for TMEM164, which will be tested in recombinant protein systems. In Aim 2, I will
leverage our lab’s longstanding expertise in covalent inhibitor discovery to identify electrophilic compounds that
block TMEM164 activity through modifying the putative catalytic cysteine of the protein. Successful completion
of this project will broaden our fundamental understanding of the lipid metabolic pathways involved in ferroptosis
and identify new candidate drug targets for suppressing the contribution of ferroptosis to human degenerative
diseases like T2DM."

Continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an important surveillance tool for critically ill neurologic
patients that provides
critical insights on disease severity for guiding medical management
. However,
ICP
monitoring requires a highly invasive procedures that incurs risks for intracranial hemorrhage and infection.24–28
Thus, the clinical indications for ICP monitoring are a topic of debate and up to 50% of traumatic brain injury
patients who fulfill recommendation criteria for an ICP monitor never receive it.22 Moreover, nearly half of patients
admitted to the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) without an ICP monitor go on to later develop elevated
ICP.1 Unfortunately, even eligible patients are only provided ICP monitoring while in the Neuro-ICU. After
adequate recovery, they are transferred to a step-down unit without a monitor even though they are still at high
risk for developing elevated ICPs and potentially fatal brain herniation. Therefore, there is a clear unmet need
for a non-invasive approach to continuous ICP monitoring.
We propose to develop a non-invasive sensing system to continuously monitor ICP by correlating beat-
to-beat carotid artery BP to ICP.
Prior studies have demonstrated that central aortic waveforms detected at
the extracranial portion of the carotid artery closely resemble ICP waveforms.3-10 In our previous work, we
developed highly sensitivity conformal sensors capable of measuring carotid artery BP waveforms with minimal
applanation pressure.
36,37 W
e have also demonstrated a novel pressure estimation algorithm that can sustain
high accuracy radial artery BP measurements in surgical and ICU patients.
13 By combining our highly sensitive
sensors with our generalizable pressure estimation algorithm,
we hypothesize that we can non-invasively and
continuously monitor ICP by developing a parameter estimation model to correlate our sensor's carotid BP
measurements with ICP waveforms using recordings from Neuro-ICU patients for training and validation
.
Studies
have also demonstrated the clinical utility of other ICP waveform-derived indices for assessing intracranial
compliance and prognosticating patient outcomes.14–18 Due to the morphological similarity between carotid BP
and ICP waveforms, we hypothesize that these waveform features can also be applied to our carotid BP
measurements and sensor-derived ICP estimations to gain unique insights on patient neurologic status that can
aid medical decision-making. T
he findings of this project have the potential to form the basis for future
investigations on utilizing the waveform features of carotid BP as a proxy measure of ICP. Moreover, i
f
successful, our proposed non-invasive, continuous ICP monitor has the potential to not only enhance
neurologic monitoring across a broader range of patients, but also create a paradigm shift in existing
clinical protocols in favor of more proactive ICP surveillance."

10841531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Little is known about the role of micromechanical stress in regulating morphology and function of
neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Axonal varicosities (swelling or beading) are enlarged,
heterogeneous structures along axonal shafts, profoundly affecting axonal conduction and synaptic
transmission. They are a key pathological feature believed to represent slow accumulation of axonal damage
that occurs during irreversible degeneration, for example in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis. In the first funding period of this R01, we discovered that fluid mechanical
stress immediately and reversibly induced varicosities in unmyelinated axons of cultured CNS neurons, and we
further visualized varicosity induction in vivo. Most brain regions including the corpus callosum in healthy adults
contain both myelinated and unmyelinated axons, while myelin appears to protect the axon from initial
mechanical injury. Using a mouse model mimicking concussion, our new studies have found immediate
varicosity formation in unmyelinated axons of cortical neurons and delayed demyelination in the cortex after
mechanical impact. Our new results have also indicated that microtubule (MT)-associated protein 6 (MAP6)
regulates axonal varicosity formation through its properties of MT stabilization and Ca2+/calmodulin binding.
Based on our new findings, we hypothesize that mechanical impact immediately induces varicosity
formation in unmyelinated axons, which is restrained by MAP6-mediated MT stabilization and
subsequently promotes adjacent demyelination that increases axon vulnerability to second impact,
leading to a vicious cycle in repeated mTBI and hence worsened behavioral impairment. To test this
original hypothesis, we will use a multidisciplinary approach including mTBI and demyelination mouse models,
cell-type-specific overexpression, knockout and rescue, confocal and electron microscopy, behavioral testing,
electrophysiological recording, a versatile biomechanical assay, myelin coculture and state-of-the-art imaging
techniques. We will determine (Aim 1) whether mTBI-induced axonal varicosity formation and behavioral
impairment can be aggravated by MAP6 deletion and ameliorated by MAP6-mediated MT stabilization, (Aim 2)
how MAP6 regulates axonal varicosity initiation, recovery, location, heterogeneity and long-term fate through
distinct signaling pathways in partially myelinated axons, and (Aim 3) how MAP6 regulates oligodendrocyte
mechanosensation, and whether preexisting demyelination and/or preexisting axonal varicosities increase the
risk of injury from repeated mechanical impact. This project represents an underexplored research field with
many open questions. This research is significant because it will provide novel mechanistic insights into central
neuron mechanosensation and mTBI primary injury."

affluent populations.
socioeconomic
factors with lung cancer is not clear.
. In addition, SES
disadvantaged populations endure a greater acceleration of biological aging. However, how the
individual and
social SES and lifestyle factors
affect DNA methylation, biological aging, and lung cancer risk in AAs and
socioeconomically disadvantaged populations is largely unknown. The ongoing NCI-funded Southern
Community Cohort Study (SCCS), a landmark investigation tracking a cohort of ~86,000 adults, two-thirds AAs
and one-third non-Hispanic EAs, shows a similar low SES among AAs and EAs. Building on these unique
resources, we will conduct the first well-powered prospective social epigenomics study in a cohort at an
elevated lung cancer risk. We will perform genome-wide methylation assays for pre-diagnostic blood samples
from 1,250 incident lung cancer cases (800 AAs and 450 EAs) and 1,700 individually-matched controls (800
AAs and 900 EAs). Using these methylation data, along with rich epidemiological data collected in the SCCS,
we will: identify methylation markers and patterns in association with race (self-reported and genetically
determined), individual and
social
SES, and lifestyle factors (Aim 1) and further investigate whether DNA
methylation markers and patterns identified in Aim 1 are associated with lung cancer risk (Aim 2); investigate
the associations between lifestyle and SES factors with biological aging (methylation-based age and age
acceleration) (Aim 3) and investigate whether biological aging is associated with lung cancer risk (Aim 4). We
will further investigate the potential effect of SES and lifestyle factor changes on DNA methylation and
biological aging. We will also conduct in vitro functional investigation of promising methylation sites and their
regulated genes. Because detailed epidemiological data and biological samples have already been collected in
the parent study, this proposed project is both highly feasible and extremely cost-efficient. Findings from this
study may provide insights into how
individual and social contextual factors
affect DNA methylation and help us
to better understand the mechanistic relationships between SES/lifestyle factors and lung cancer risk. The
findings may also provide useful information which could be used to ameliorate the lung cancer disparities."

α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a protein abundantly distributed in presynaptic terminals. α-Syn pathology is linked to
synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia, and α-Syn missense muta-
tions cause early onset PD. Physiologically, α-Syn functions in synaptic transmission via clustering synaptic
vesicles (SVs) and promoting SNARE-complex assembly. This function strongly depends on binding to SVs.
Pathologically, levels of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and functional monomeric α-Syn
simultaneously decrease with increasing duration of dementia, which implies a potential functional link between
VAMP2 and normal monomeric α-Syn. Preliminary data showed VAMP2 interacts with α-Syn to prevent α-Syn
aggregation. The long-term goal of this project is to define and characterize critical protein factors that stabilize
binding of α-Syn on SVs and test their effect on neuron function and α-Syn induced toxicity. The central hy-
pothesis is that VAMP2 stabilizes α-Syn in its functional conformation on SVs to mediate vesicle clustering and
SNARE-complex assembly, and to prevent pathological aggregation. Guided by strong preliminary data, this
hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine how VAMP2 prevents α-Syn aggregation and
toxicity; 2) Determine α-Syn’s function in SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro; 3) Determine the influence of
VAMP2 on α-Syn’s function and toxicity in vivo. Under the first aim, α-Syn interaction with VAMP2, folding and
oligomerization will be analyzed in solution and on membranes, using NMR, ThioflavinT, CD, FRET and solid-
state nanopore experiments on recombinant α-Syn variants. Under the second aim, the mechanism and kinet-
ics of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion will be analyzed, using single-molecule fusion, vesicle clustering and
NMR experiments on recombinant α-Syn variants. Under the third aim, localization, function, and aggregation
of α-Syn variants will be analyzed, using biochemical and cell biological assays on primary mouse neurons, in
addition to behavioral and pathology readouts in wild-type and heterozygous VAMP2 mice. The study is ex-
pected to show improved function and reduced toxicity of α-Syn with increased SV binding. This research is
significant because it will (1) clarify the importance of SV binding of α-Syn for SNARE-complex assembly and
neuron function, (2) provide novel insights into the function/dysfunction of recently identified PD-mutations of α-
Syn, (3) provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying SV-binding of α-Syn by altering VAMP2
levels, and has (4) translational importance for the targeted development of new strategies aimed at preserving
α-Syn’s function via stabilizing its SV-bound pool through elevating VAMP2 levels. Our study is innovative be-
cause it (1) uses a multidisciplinary approach combining biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological ap-
proaches, (2) uses unique single-particle detection assays to study α-Syn function and early oligomerization,
and (3) tests the novel hypothesis that VAMP2 is important stabilizers of SV-binding of α-Syn and that stabili-
zation of the SV-bound pool of α-Syn prevents its aggregation and toxicity."
10817854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to combat drug addiction, a major public health burden.
Unfortunately, current efforts are hampered by a focus on a very limited range of drug targets. Decades of work
have established that the transcription factor DFosB plays a critical role in drug addictive behaviors in rodent
models, with validation in humans available as well. In response to chronic cocaine or opioids (e.g., heroin)
administration, DFosB mediates aspects of drug seeking, reward, self-administration, and relapse. Due to its
unusual stability, DFosB accumulates to very high levels in the brain in regions critical for reward, making it an
attractive target for addiction therapies. However, critical mechanistic aspects of DFosB function are not known,
making it difficult to pursue DFosB as a therapeutic target. It is not known how DFosB molecules are arranged
in vivo, what molecular features control their ability to bind to DNA and turn genes on or off, and whether these
features can be targeted strategically with small molecules in order to regulate DFosB function in vivo to combat
drug use disorders. We hypothesize that, by modulating ∆FosB with small molecules, we can selectively
regulate key strategic DFosB gene targets, and thereby the long-term neural and behavioral adaptations that
DFosB triggers in response to chronic drug use. To test our hypotheses, we propose to 1) optimize a series of
validated lead compounds into high-affinity chemical probes targeting DFosB in vitro and in vivo; 2) unravel how
key molecular features in DFosB regulate its actions; and 3) determine how targeting these features either with
our chemical probes or novel genetic tools alters behaviors in animal models of addiction. To this end, we have
an outstanding translational research team overseeing a robust and effective experimental platform that draws
on our prior combined work. We have already achieved important milestones. First, we have discovered that
DFosB partners not only with JunD but also with itself in order to bind DNA, and these two species are structurally
and functionally very different. Second, we have uncovered a molecular switch in ∆FosB that controls its binding
to DNA and that works differently in heteromeric vs. homomeric ∆FosB complexes. Third, we have developed a
large panel of lead compounds that target DFosB and that we can leverage to gain both fundamental mechanistic
insight into DFosB function, as well as assess their in vivo effects on addictive behaviors. Together, our work
creates a powerful, previously unavailable, and highly actionable platform to test the utility of DFosB as a
therapeutic target. The positive impact of this work will be to further de-risk DFosB as a therapeutic target by
creating comprehensive, mechanism-based knowledge onto which a drug discovery program will be anchored,
focused on a completely novel target to combat addiction. This innovative proposal will provide novel insight
into the pathophysiology of drug addiction, and novel chemical probes validated in cells and animal models,
which together will serve as a strong platform from which to target DFosB for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes."

 Ethnic/racial minorities (ERMs) are more likely to suffer from short sleep duration and poor sleep quality
relative to Whites. Sociodemographic and environmental stressors disproportionately impact ERMs and have
been implicated in the development and maintenance of race-related sleep disparities. The transition to college
is an especially important time to investigate sleep since young adults encounter a unique configuration of
sociodemographic and environmental stressors linked to sleep. No longer tethered to early high school start
times, college students report later and more irregular bedtimes. College students also sleep less and more
poorly than adults, suggesting a developmental peak in sleep disturbances among young adults.
 Focusing on two sleep-vulnerable groups – ERMs and college students - this 5-year longitudinal study
investigates race-related sleep disparities in a diverse sample of college students during and after the
transition to college; and how race-related sleep disparities forecast downstream health and academic
outcomes through students’ senior year. The study also investigates the risk and protective effects of
ethnic/racial identity as a dynamic and changing moderator during this period.
 The innovative and novel combination of daily diaries and sleep actigraphy, biannual surveys, and annual
assessments of inflammatory biomarkers, telomere length and anthropometric measures offers an unparalleled
opportunity to investigate the daily and longer-term mechanisms, pathways, and consequences of race-related
sleep disparities in a large sample of ERM and White college students. A key innovation of the study is the
intersectional inclusion of ERM, socioeconomic, 1st-generation college, resident and commuter diversity. The
three specific aims of the study are informed by strong preliminary data (R21MD011388), scientific premise,
and the race-based disparities in stress and sleep in context model. The proposed study:
1. Determines the daily and longer-term impact of sociodemographic and environmental stress on race-
 related sleep disparities (duration, quality, regularity) during the college transition and the next four years
2. Identifies race-related sleep disparities as an explanatory pathway for sociodemographic and
 environmental stress to impact health, academic and physiologic biomarker (inflammation and telomere
 length) outcomes
3. Investigates ethnic/racial identity as a dynamic moderator of the daily and longer-term effects of stress on
 sleep, and of sleep on outcomes
Together, these aims advance developmental and health equity science, investigating how sociodemographic
and environmental stress contribute to race-related sleep disparities among diverse college students to
forecast daily and longer-term health and academics over time."
10817752,"Lysosomal dysfunctions have been extensively associated with neurodegenerative diseases, but the
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Mutations in the GRN gene, which lead to the deficiency of
progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal glycoprotein, cause Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Loss of PGRN
impairs lysosomal activity, but the precise function of PGRN in lysosomes is unknown. This is, in part, due
to a lack of high-throughput methodologies to identify and quantify proteins involved in the highly dynamic
and sometimes transient lysosomal activities. The long-term goal is to identify druggable pathways and
therapeutic targets for FTD. The overall objectives of this proposal are to 1) develop mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomic strategies to characterize spatiotemporal lysosomal interaction, composition, and
degradative function in human Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and 2) evaluate how
PGRN deficiency impairs dynamic lysosomal activities and phenotypes in human neurons. The central
hypothesis is that loss of progranulin impairs lysosomal interaction and degradative function in human
neurons, which can be determined by a combination of MS-based proteomic strategies and cell biology
approaches. The objectives will be achieved by the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Develop
spatiotemporal lysosomal proximity labeling methods to determine if loss of progranulin impairs dynamic
lysosomal interaction and composition in human neurons. Aim 2: Develop a dynamic SILAC proteomic
method to determine if loss of progranulin alters the turnover rates of proteins that rely on autophagy for
degradation in neurons. Aim 3: Determine if extracellular addition of progranulin can rescue the proteomic
changes and FTD phenotype caused by progranulin deficiency in human neurons. The proposed research
is highly innovative both in technological and biological aspects. It uniquely integrates innovative MS-based
proteomic techniques with the advanced human iPSC-neuron platform and cell biology approaches to
characterize dynamic lysosomal activities and molecular mechanisms underlying FTD. If extracellular
progranulin does rescue the proteomic changes and FTD phenotype, then increasing progranulin levels
can be a very promising therapeutic method to develop disease modifying treatments for FTD."

 This proposal responds directly to the purpose of the RFA-MD-22-003 STTR Funding Opportunity
Announcement (FOA). Nearly 44 million Americans experience hearing loss, but as much as 86% of adults
who could benefit from hearing aid devices (HAD) do not use them. Untreated hearing loss is almost twice
more prevalent in rural areas. More than 46 million people live in rural America, but these communities face
significant barriers and delays in accessing care and experience a lack of providers for audiology services. The
average retail price of HADs was $4,700, making it prohibitively expensive the rural and minority populations
who have lower incomes. Hearing loss is also highly prevalent in black and Latino/Hispanic communities and
growing, but older black adults were 58% and Mexican American older adults were 78% less likely to use
HADs, due to reasons of high cost and lack of insurance coverage. Aside from cost, concerns about comfort,
effectiveness and satisfaction are the other significant barriers to HAD usage.
 A long-term goal of hearing health professionals, the auditory research community, and HAD makers has
been to reduce these barriers. The current hearing care delivery in the U.S. follows a model of specialty clinic-
based care, through audiologists, which is costly and time-consuming for the rural and minority populations.
The introduction of over-the-counter (OTC) HADs is set to disrupt this model and increase accessibility and
affordability of hearing care for these populations. Automation of HAD fittings and self-adjustments further
enable listeners to pick gain settings according to their individual preferences, which significantly increases
listener satisfaction and acceptance. It is common practice today for an audiologist to follow a time-consuming
process in which she fine tunes the HAD settings to the users’ individual demands, based on verbal
descriptions from the user. This approach is burdensome to both the audiologist and the HAD user and might
not provide the satisfaction and comfort the user truly desires. Allowing users to make these changes easily via
automation can vastly improve their satisfaction and use of HADs.
 This project will develop machine learning (ML) based automatic gain adjustment software in a
smartphone with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), to minimize the effort required for individualized settings in
an OTC HAD. Recent studies of self-adjusted gain have shown consistent within-subject preferences but gain
settings that differ greatly from prescribed settings (up to 20dB), and also shown a great deal of between-
subject variability in gain preferences. We propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based prediction model that
learns the non-linear relationships in the data and outcomes, otherwise difficult to ascertain through normal
statistics. The DNN will be combined with other ML techniques to refine the final gain settings. With
smartphone assistive software and the predictive power of ML, our proposed solution will automate
personalized fittings for OTC HADs, significantly improving their accessibility, affordability and acceptance,
thus benefitting the rural and minority populations the most.
 Automating HAD gain settings with the use of machine learning (ML) techniques will increase the ease of
use and reduce costs while improving intelligibility and comfort. OTC HADs will improve access and cost and
will lead to much higher adoptions of HADs in the rural and minority communities, improving their quality of life."
10824235,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common rhythm disturbance in the US and other developed countries. AF
significantly affects the lives of the afflicted, causing symptoms that range from palpitations to fatigue,
weakness, activity intolerance, stroke, congestive heart failure and death. The impact on public health is
substantial, with more than 450,000 hospital admissions per year and $26 billion in healthcare costs.
Adding to the problems caused by AF is the lack of safe and effective therapies for this rhythm disorder.
Pharmacotherapy for AF has a long history of poor efficacy and potentially lethal side effects. Ablation
strategies have made inroads in paroxysmal AF, but they continue to be long, difficult procedures with less
than optimal success rates and too frequent adverse events. Ablation does not cure AF. We propose
development of gene therapy as a new strategy to eliminate AF. Like many other effective therapies, gene
therapy must focus on disease mechanism as a starting point for development. In the case of AF, electrical
and structural remodeling are critical elements of the disease mechanism that we aim to reverse. We have
previously shown the ability to eliminate the action potential shortening and conduction velocity slowing
elements of electrical remodeling with gene transfer of a dominant negative potassium channel mutation
and connexins. We recently found partial reversal of structural remodeling with inhibition of the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. In this proposal, we hypothesize that calcium and
mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cause AF-related structural remodeling. We explore this
hypothesis in a clinically relevant porcine model of atrial fibrillation and heart failure by using molecular
methods to correlate signaling pathway activation to structural remodeling and specific drug or genetic
blockers of the relevant signaling pathways to more completely connect pathway activation to structural
remodeling. To address our hypothesis, we propose 3 aims: (1) to define and prevent AF-related
structural remodeling caused by calcineurin overactivity; (2) to evaluate ERK1/2 signaling in AF; (3)
to evaluate the effects of multiple signaling pathway blockade on AF-related structural remodeling.
Successful completion of our aims will not only identify critical mechanisms driving AF-related structural
remodeling, but it will also complete a substantial component of the preclinical testing necessary to translate
these investigational agents into clinical therapies."
10786040,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Homebound older adults are often functionally dependent and at risk for placement in institutions such as
nursing homes. The majority of older adults would prefer to age in place in their homes so research is needed
to identify interventions that can help them maintain their autonomy. Frailty is an age-related syndrome highly
predictive of functional decline and mortality, which is very prevalent in our preliminary studies of homebound
older adults (56% frail, 44% prefrail, none were robust) and mainly driven by slow walking speed (88%).
 Because the homebound population is difficult to reach, there have been few studies and no clinical trials in
this population. In our pilot randomized controlled trial of an exercise program administered by Meals on
Wheels (MOW), 9 participants (5 treatment, 4 control) completed the 12-week study which showed that gait
speed and total frailty score improved in the treatment group. The improvement in gait speed is particularly
exciting given its prevalence in homebound older adults. In addition, there were no adverse events and the
participants enjoyed the exercises as well as the convenience of the meal deliveries.
 To further evaluate the clinical changes seen in our trial, we assessed potential novel frailty biomarkers.
These biomarkers could help identify frailty earlier than may be seen clinically and provide valuable information
about the effects of frailty interventions. Inflammatory biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive
protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) have been associated with frailty status but not
correlated with treatments. We preliminarily tested heat shock protein (HSP) 70, which induces muscle wasting
in cancer cachexia, as well as macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and soluble interleukin-6
receptor (sIL-6R) to see if they could be more specific frailty biomarkers. Our exercise group had decreased
HSP70, MIP-1β, and sIL-6R when compared to the control group over 12 weeks.
 Thus we have 2 aims: 1) evaluate the effects of a home-based exercise program administered through
MOW on gait speed and frailty status in frail/prefrail homebound older adults, and 2) assess the association
between novel serum biomarkers (HSP70, MIP-1β, sIL-6R) and established but non-specific frailty biomarkers
(IL-6, CRP, TNF-α) in frail/prefrail homebound older adults before and after the exercise intervention.
 Data from this project will be the catalyst for an R01 or equivalent award involving multi-pronged frailty
interventions, targeting mechanistic and clinical pathways, with the goal of helping homebound older adults
age in place. This career award would also provide training and mentorship for Dr. Jessica Lee to develop into
a physician-scientist with independent funding. UTHealth has provided her with a supportive environment,
individualized career development plan, and expert mentors with long-standing experience in geriatrics, clinical
trials, exercise interventions, biomarkers, and biostatistics. As the medical director of a home-based primary
care service, her goal is to become an expert in interventions to improve resilience in her homebound patients."
10834894,"Little is known regarding the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, and comorbidities of hearing loss and
tinnitus in the military population. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is consequently unable to predict
the risk of auditory disorders in Service members exposed to noise. Compounding this problem, many other
military and non-military exposures can cause auditory injury, including solvents, blasts and other sources of
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and certain other injuries and medical conditions. Non-military (e.g., recreational)
or post-military exposures (i.e., Veterans' occupational exposures) may also contribute to long-term risk. It is
critical to attain a fundamental understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of tinnitus and hearing
loss, as well as their interrelatedness. Such an understanding could help identify individuals at risk for auditory
injury, and ultimately lead toward much-needed rehabilitation methods that target the underlying causes.
In 2012, in response to recommendations made by the Institute of Medicine (IOM; now the National Academies
of Medicine) in their congressionally-mandated report titled, “Noise and Military Service: Implications for
Hearing Loss and Tinnitus,” we assembled a team of audiology, epidemiology, and health services researchers
at the VA Rehabilitation Research & Development (RR&D) National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory
Research (NCRAR) to design a longitudinal study focused on auditory health in recent Veterans. The Noise
Outcomes In Service members Epidemiology Study (“NOISE Study”) was funded in 2013 [Congressionally
Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) grant #W81XWH-12- PRMRP-IIRA]. The study enrolls
Veterans within 2.5 years of military separation, allowing us to measure their military exposures within a
reasonable recall period. In 2014, the Department of Defense (DoD) Hearing Center of Excellence (HCE; San
Antonio, TX) was added as a second site to increase enrollment and to expand our target population to include
active-duty military Service members. Enrollment at the HCE began in June 2015. The present proposal
requests funding to continue study activities for the next 4-year period for the NCRAR site. (Should the HCE
not receive continuation funding from the DoD, their participants will be followed by the NCRAR team.)
Since the NOISE Study's inception, baseline data have been collected on 644 Veterans at the NCRAR and
373 Service members at the HCE (1,017 participants enrolled across the two sites). The baseline examination
includes a full audiologic test battery with an extensive survey component. Participants complete annual follow-
up surveys (online) to capture ongoing exposures and any changes in health and functioning. The in-person
audiologic examination is repeated every 5 years, allowing us to identify changes in auditory function over time
and contrast those changes with Veterans' past military exposures and/or ongoing non-military exposures. For
the proposed continuation study (NOISE Study 3.0), we will expand data collection to address current and
evolving interests in the field of auditory health, to include focusing on blast as a risk factor for outcomes of
auditory functioning, and testing for central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) and cochlear synaptopathy.
These efforts will produce an unprecedented epidemiologic dataset revealing cross-sectional and longitudinal
associations between a wide range of exposures, medical and mental health conditions, peripheral auditory
function, central auditory function, and tinnitus. Deliverables include a series of research reports containing
analyses and recommendations with a special focus on: estimates of incident tinnitus and hearing loss
following military service and identifying sub-populations at-risk; individual and population-level trajectories of
hearing and tinnitus; estimates of the association between cochlear synaptopathy and central auditory
dysfunction with incident tinnitus and perceived hearing ability; and confluence of auditory dysfunction and
mental distress on quality of life in post-9/11 Veterans. Clinical deliverables include validation of surveys for
capturing noise and chemical exposures and distinguishing occasional from chronic tinnitus."

 Little is unknown about the mechanisms involved in the regulation of neuronal network activity by the
microtubule associated protein tau, a key pathogenic protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The long term goal
is to develop an independent career as a neuropathologist and a molecular neuroscientist integrating
observations from human neuropathology with molecular understanding to gain new insights into AD
pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies. This research is initially focused on how tau regulates neuronal
activity and how this regulation relates to mechanisms of AD. Preliminary studies show tau localization is
regulated by homeostatic scaling, a critical form of synaptic plasticity implicated in AD. The overall objectives
for this application are to (i) elucidate the role of tau in homeostatic scaling, (ii) define alterations in the
molecular interactions of tau during homeostatic scaling, and (iii) determine the role of homeostatic scaling in
the post-synaptic alterations of tau and AMPA receptors in culture models of AD. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that homeostatic scaling pathways are regulated by tau and are utilized by Aβ to create post-
synaptic changes in AD. This hypothesis will be tested using live neuron fluorescent imaging of tau and AMPA
receptors, inhibition or knock-down of tau and proteins critical to homeostatic scaling, and mass spectrometry
analysis of tau interacting proteins under homeostatic scaling conditions. The rationale for this project is that
improved understanding of tau functions and their relationship to the pathogenesis of AD may lead to new
avenues of investigation for AD therapies while offering an opportunity to establish the candidate's
independence as a molecular neuroscientist. This effort will directly involve the mentorship of Dr. Richard
Huganir, an expert neuroscientist in the field of molecular mechanisms synaptic plasticity, and will take
advantage of the rich and collaborative environment of Alzheimer's disease research at Johns Hopkins
University. This work will build on the candidate's strong foundation in neurodegenerative disease pathology
and research, which will be supplemented by training in synaptic biology, imaging techniques, human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and biostatistical analysis, areas critical to the proposed work and to future
investigations. The proposed research is innovative because it defines novel roles and interactions of tau
regulated by neuronal activity, and it directly tests the contribution of homeostatic scaling to AD-related
synaptic changes. The proposed research is significant because it will provide insight into novel biologic
functions and interactions of tau, and their relationship to AD pathogenesis. Ultimately, knowledge of these
mechanisms may elucidate of the contribution of tau to sporadic AD and lead to novel therapeutic strategies."

Approximately, 50% of HIV-positive people develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite
being under combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). HAND is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease
characterized by increased macrophage infiltration and persistent HIV replication in the brain of affected
individuals. There are no effective therapies available against HAND. Our laboratory has found increased
expression of cathepsin B, a pro-inflammatory lysosomal enzyme, in postmortem brain tissues of individuals with
HAND. In addition, after HIV-1 infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), secreted cathepsin B
changes interactions with other proteins such as serum amyloid P component (SAPC) and promotes
neurotoxicity. Thus, targeting cathepsin B represents a potential strategy against HAND. In search for new
therapies, it was demonstrated that activation of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) inhibits HIV-1 replication
in macrophages, reduces blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, decreases neurotoxicity to HIV-1 viral proteins,
and diminishes pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Nonetheless, studies have shown increased expression of
CB2R in in vitro HIV-infected macrophages, and in post-mortem brain tissues of HAND patients. Therefore, this
receptor represents a promising target for treatment against HAND. However, the role of CB2R activation in
cathepsin B secretion and neurotoxicity has not been studied previously. The overall objective of this proposal
is to understand the mechanisms of CB2R activation in cathepsin B secretion and neurotoxicity from HIV-infected
macrophages. Our central hypothesis is that CB2R activation will prevent cathepsin B secretion and neurotoxicity
from HIV-infected macrophages by attenuating intracellular inflammation pathways in MDM and preventing
cathepsin B interactions with SAPC. Our hypothesis was formulated based on results that show a significant
decrease in cathepsin B secretion and neurotoxicity from HIV-infected MDM treated with a CB2R agonist. We
will test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this proposal by pursuing the following
specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of CB2R activation in cathepsin B secretion and neurotoxicity from HIV-
infected macrophages. 2) Explore the intracellular pathways and characterize cathepsin B interactome in
supernatants from HIV-infected macrophages after CB2R activation. 3) Understand the mechanisms of chronic
inflammation in HAND. The rationale for this proposed research is that understanding the role of CB2R activation
in cathepsin B secretion and interactions will permit the development of strategies against HIV-induced cathepsin
B neurotoxicity. This contribution is significant because it will provide new knowledge about the mechanisms of
CB2R modulation in cathepsin B-induced neurotoxicity from HIV-infected macrophages, and will contribute to
the development of new strategies against HAND."

While clinical trials remain a critical source for oncology research, their study findings may not be gener-
alizable to the real world due to the restricted patient population. In recent years, due to the increasing adoption
of electronic health records (EHR) and the linkage of EHR with specimen bio-repositories and other research
registries, integrated large datasets now exist as a new source for translational research. These integrated
datasets open opportunities for developing accurate EHR-based prediction models for disease progression
and treatment response, which can be easily incorporated into clinical practice. These models can also be
contrasted with models derived from clinical trials, bridging the gap between clinical trials and the real world.
However, efficiently deriving and evaluating personalized prediction models using such real world data (RWD)
remains challenging due to practical and methodological obstacles. For example, validated outcome
information from EHR, such as development of colon cancer and 1-year treatment response, requires
laborious medical record review and hence is often not readily available for research. Naive use of error prone
surrogates of the outcome, such as billing codes or procedure codes, as the true outcome may greatly hamper
the power of EHR studies and produce biased results. Semi-supervised risk prediction methods, leveraging
noisy surrogates and a small amount of human annotations on the outcome, may greatly improve the utility of
EHR for precision medicine research. Deriving a precise estimate of the risk model becomes even more
challenging when the number of candidate features is not small relative to the number of annotated outcomes.
Another major challenge with EHR risk modeling lies in the transportability. Complex machine learning models
trained in one EHR system often attain low accuracy in another EHR system, due to the heterogeneity in the
patient population and healthcare system. Transfer learning methods that can automatically adjust model
developed for one EHR cohort to better fit to another EHR cohort is of great value. Synthesizing information
from multiple data sources can improve the quality of evidence. However, meta analyzing EHR from multiple
EHR cohorts faces an additional challenge due to patient privacy. We address these challenges by developing
semi-supervised risk prediction methods with high dimensional predictions in Aim 1; semi-supervised transfer
learning methods to enable risk prediction modeling in target populations with no gold standard labels uted
learin Aim 2; and distributed learning methods for high dimensional predictive modeling in Aim."
10847503,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dental plaque and associated periodontal diseases represent a common infectious disease afflicting nearly
half of American adults (CDC). The complex intra- and interspecies interactions regulate the development of
multispecies oral microbial communities called dental plaque. The dental plaque is made of an organized,
highly complex microbial social community and the Gram-negative anaerobe F.nucleatum is a key organism of
this microbiome by virtue of its unique capability to physically aggregate with many early and late colonizers.
Besides its role in periodontitis, F. nucleatum has been linked to several extra-oral diseases including preterm
birth and colorectal cancer. Although the fusobacterial interactions with other bacteria have been widely
studied and four coaggregation adhesins identified, little is known about mechanisms that regulate
Fusobacterium-mediated coaggregation, mainly due to the lack of a robust genetic toolkit for manipulation of F.
nucleatum. To overcome this, we recently developed a convenient gene deletion system for F. nucleatum and
generated a large library of random transposon mutants with ~10-fold genome coverage. Screening of this
library uncovered several coaggregation factors, which include a unique two-component system termed CarS-
CarR and a nine-gene-operon that encodes a lysine-degrading pathway (LDP) that controls the amount and
activity of RadD, respectively. RadD, a type IV autotransporter, is a versatile adhesin that mediates
fusobacterial adhesion with many early and some late colonizers. Based on these findings, we plan to
characterize the two regulatory factors in-depth. We will be the first time to show an oral bacterial two
component signaling component regulates expression of cell-cell adhesin in a cell density-dependent manner
and characterize a lysine riboswitch related to lysine catabolism in bacteria. Upon the successful completion of
this research, we expect to have significantly contributed to the understanding of how the versatile adhesin
RadD is regulated by identifying and deciphering factors and mechanism involved. Because RadD requires F.

10914639,"ABSTRACT. The present competing renewal application proposes to create the next generation NKI-Rockland
Sample (NKI-RS) initiative. The NKI-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) has served as a beacon for lifespan
connectomics research, providing a model for accelerating the pace of psychiatric discovery science. More than
200 publications have used NKI-RS, generated largely by independent investigators and in major journals. Since
2011, it has generated and publicly shared (on a quarterly basis) a large-scale (N > 1400), deeply phenotyped,
community-ascertained, cross-sectional, lifespan sample (ages 6–85 years old) with advanced connectomics-
focused neuroimaging (i.e., diffusion MRI, resting state fMRI [R-fMRI]) and genetic samples. Recently launched
large- scale efforts, such as the HCP Lifespan Studies and the NIH ABCD Study are working to bring to scale
human connectome mapping and brain function across the lifespan, using ‘battle-tested’ imaging technologies
and strategies. These ongoing studies are less focused on mental health. Moreover, technologies and ideas
continue to evolve - often too rapidly to permit timely testing and inclusion in ongoing research. The overarching
goal of the present proposal is to create the next generation NKI-RS initiative that will once again extend the
vanguard in the study of lifespan connectomics by enriching and expanding the landscape for neuroscientific
advancement and biomarker discovery. Three major themes have guided the design of the proposed NKI-RS-II
lifespan resource: 1) multimodal measurement integration across functional domains (e.g., fMRI, EEG, mobile
brain/body imaging [MoBI] framework), 2) ecological sampling (e.g., wearables, sensors, smartphones apps),
and 3) enhanced physiological phenotyping for cardiovascular fitness and obesity. Specifically, in a community-
ascertained lifespan sample (N=600; ages 9-75; M: F = 1:1; age range selected to maximize data yield and
tolerability), the proposed work aims to: 1) Generate and share large-scale multimodal MRI/EEG imaging data
complemented by comprehensive phenotyping of cognition, behavior, and psychiatric status, from human and
sensor-based informants; 2) Optimize brain-age prediction across the lifespan using multimodal data (R-fMRI,
Naturalistic Viewing fMRI [NV-fMRI], dMRI, T2/T1, R-EEG, NV-EEG) and relate deviations from chronological
age to dimensions of psychopathology and cognitive performance; and 3) Identify the relationship of modifiable
health risk factors (e.g., fitness, obesity, physical activity, substance use) to deviations between predicted brain
age and chronological age across the lifespan. Consistent with the model established by the previously funded
NKI-RS initiatives, all data will be shared prospectively, on a quarterly basis, via the International Neuroimaging
Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) and the NIMH Data Archive (NDA)."
10861725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This T32 postdoctoral training program proposes to train 3 postdoctoral trainees annually, totaling 15 trainees
across 5 years. Each trainee will receive funding for two years. We will create a cadre of scholars with
commanding knowledge and experiences across all three translational spheres as well as a deep commitment
to transdisciplinary team science. This T32 will provide the necessary early-career training to produce a
diverse pool of highly trained scientists with the requisite skills to address the nation’s biomedical, behavioral,
and clinical research needs. Our conceptual framework organizes the translational continuum into three
spheres: Discovery, Demonstration, and Dissemination. Scholars undertake and become domain experts
within one sphere and receive training in bridging domains and exposure across the spheres, emerging with a
broad, invaluable perspective of how their research fits within the breadth of translational science and how
discoveries move through the continuum. In addition to domain-specific training overseen by primary mentors,
the T32 program includes training in: (1) core knowledge of translational science research; (2) the value of and
skills needed in team science; (3) how equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) contribute to scientific excellence;
(4) research ethics and reproducibility; (4) community engagement; (5) career and leadership development; (6)
grant and manuscript writing; and (7) bridging domains and scientific and lay communication. We are equally
committed to ensuring a diverse group of scholars in order to ensure the pipeline of scientists are as diverse as
the subjects they research. However, recruiting diverse scholars is not enough to ensure an environment
where diverse scholars can thrive. To create such a space, it is critical to teach to all trainees and mentors the
history of racism in science and medicine and how to be an anti-racist scientist. Thus, all trainees and their
primary mentors will receive this training. During their training T32 scholars will receive holistic mentoring and
career guidance from not only their primary mentor, but also secondary, near-peer, and program leadership. In
collaboration with mentors, we will develop a cadre of scholars who are experts in their domains, with a
commanding knowledge of translational science, who have the ability to innovate and advance translation, and
who are skilled communicators, boundary crossers, and team-players with a deep commitment to
transdisciplinary team science. Our overarching goal is to produce a new generation of scientists with strategic
translational emphases whose breadth of knowledge and ability to communicate across boundaries will
increase transdisciplinary cross-fertilization and accelerate healthcare advances."

 Intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture is the primary cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, a
catastrophic event that carries high rates of mortality (>50%) and permanent disability (>50% among survivors).
When an unruptured IA is discovered, clinicians face the difficult decision of whether or not it should be treated.
Since rupture rates are low (risk of rupture ~ 0.5-1% per year), while complication risks of intervention can be
significant, it is critical to stratify rupture risk such that the dangerous IAs are treated right away while less
dangerous ones can be periodically monitored. In clinical practice, aneurysm size has been the principal criterion
for treatment, but it is not always reliable. Recently, other clinical metrics, such as the PHASES (Population,
Hypertension, Age, Size of IA, Earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, and Site of IA) score, which use IA
characteristics and patient demographics, have been developed and validated in attempts to better stratify risk.
However, like IA size, such risk metrics can only be accurately assessed after the patient has received digital
subtraction angiography (DSA), which is invasive, expensive ($5,000-8,500 per scan), and risky for transient or
permanent complications. Furthermore, these metrics lack information about biological differences underlying
IAs that may better discriminate high- vs low-risk cases. A blood-based diagnostic of dangerous IAs would
enable more informed IA management and could offer a low-cost, non-invasive way to monitor patients
during watchful waiting or after treatment (between follow-up imaging).
 Over the past several years, Neurovascular Diagnostics has been developing a blood-based IA diagnostic
called AneuScreenTM. During development, we found that expression differences of certain genes also stratified
IA cases by IA size in a “dose-dependent” manner, leading us to hypothesize that patients with high-risk IAs
have distinguishable gene expression patterns in their blood. In a successfully completed Phase I SBIR project,
we used whole blood transcriptomes from a modestly-sized dataset of IA patients to develop and test machine
learning classifiers of high-risk aneurysm cases (delineated by PHASES score). This model had 88% testing
accuracy, 78% sensitivity, and 95% specificity. Despite these exciting results, further work is needed to translate
this biomarker into a diagnostic test, which is the focus of this Phase II SBIR project. In Aim 1, we will validate
the genes within the IA risk biomarker in a large dataset of previously-collected blood samples that will be
subjected to RNA sequencing. In Aim 2, we will standardize the assessment of the biomarker on an established
clinical platform that utilizes qPCR and capillary electrophoresis for expression readout. The models will be re-
trained to perform well using this new output data-type. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will test the developed assay, which
we call AneuScreenTM+(or AneuScreenTM Plus), in a prospective cohort of n=400 patients with IA and n=200
controls. Successful completion of this Phase II will determine if our prototype IA diagnostic can expand its
capabilities and increase its value by stratifying IA risk, in addition to identifying IA."
10766706,"Project Summary/Abstract. Approximately 14 million women in the United States will develop posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) during their lifetime following physical or sexual assault or abuse (interpersonal trauma
[IPT]). Posttraumatic shame – an emotion stemming from harsh attitudes about the self after trauma – is
central to PTSD for many women post-IPT. Yet, knowledge of the frequency, intensity, stability, and triggers of
shame in the daily lives of women with IPT histories is lacking. Further, though shame and guilt (an emotion
defined by negative feelings about one’s actions) are studied separately by researchers, no work has assessed
whether women with IPT histories make similar distinctions and see shame and guilt as differentially
influencing their recovery from IPT. While some work has begun to explore shame-specific emotion regulation
(ER), or processes aimed at changing emotional responses to meet specific goals, it remains unclear which – if
any – ER strategies are effective in reducing the frequency or intensity of shame. Other factors likely to shape
posttraumatic shame regulation – including perceived effectiveness of ER strategies, goals of ER, and PTSD
severity – also have yet to be explored. Addressing these gaps could strengthen treatments for shame and
PTSD. This project will use a sequential mixed methods design to explore 1) daily experiences of
posttraumatic shame (including triggers; frequency, intensity, and stability; relations to PTSD symptoms;
changes over time; and factors distinguishing shame from guilt) and 2) regulation of posttraumatic shame
(including use, perceived effectiveness, and adaptiveness of ER strategies and roles of PTSD symptoms and
ER goals in shame regulation). Both aims will be assessed quantitatively (Study 1) and qualitatively (Study 2).
Study 1 will involve secondary analysis of ecological momentary assessment data on shame and ER obtained
5 times per day for 14 days from 60 women with IPT histories and varying levels of PTSD symptoms. Study 2
will involve qualitative interviews on the experience and regulation of posttraumatic shame with 20-35 women
with IPT histories. It is expected that higher PTSD symptoms will predict higher subsequent shame and that
shame will predict more frequent rumination, emotion suppression, and distraction and less frequent emotion
sharing, emotional reflection, and reappraisal within persons and across days. Relations between shame and
ER strategies are expected to be stronger among women with more severe PTSD symptoms, and reverse
models (ER predicting shame) will be tested. Themes regarding triggers, distinctions between shame and guilt,
consequences of shame, and the role of PTSD symptoms are expected and new themes may emerge. Greater
understanding of the experience and regulation of posttraumatic shame could improve treatments for shame
and PTSD among women with IPT histories and will be key to advancing the PI’s research. This training grant
will facilitate the PI’s progression toward an independent, grant-funded research career examining the role of
emotional vulnerabilities in PTSD among women with IPT histories."

The finely tuned production of aldosterone controls blood pressure by regulating water and sodium retention.
The overproduction of aldosterone, however, leads to primary aldosteronism, the major form of secondary
hypertension. This mineralocorticoid hormone is produced by cytochrome P450 11B2 (CYP11B2), also known
as aldosterone synthase. While lowering aldosterone levels through inhibition of CYP11B2 has been established
as a potential therapeutic approach, a few challenges are associated with this tactic. For example, CYP11B2
shares a 93% sequence identity with the cortisol-producing P450 11B1 (CYP11B1). Despite the similarities
between CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, there exist key functional and structural differences. Overall, this research
aims to understand how these subtle differences contribute to the catalytic function of these enzymes in order to
aid drug development."
10908289,"Rotavirus (RV) is a major etiological cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhea worldwide, resulting in the death of more than 200,000 children each year. Current RV vaccines have limited efficacy in endemic countries and no direct antivirals are available. Our overall objective is to better understand the mechanism by which human RVs enter human small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The head region (VP8*) of the RV outer capsid spike protein VP4 is responsible for viral entry. However, the identities of host factors that interact with VP8* and their roles in human RV entry is unclear. In preliminary studies, we conducted a flow cytometry-based genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen and identified several transmembrane host proteins as putative attachment factors. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and classic adsorption assays to functionally examine the role of these candidates in human RV entry into HT-29 cells and primary human IECs. In Aim 2, we will employ chemical labeling and proteomic approaches and identify the VP8*-interacting cellular partners during human RV entry. Using host genetic screens, RV reverse genetics, and human intestinal organoid cultures, we expect that our study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which host molecules facilitate the early replication of human RVs. We ultimately aim to harness that knowledge to develop countermeasures to impede infection and protect against diarrheal diseases."

Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) is a stroke subtype with an incidence of 15 people per million per
year. CVST primarily affects children and young adults, especially young women of child-bearing age and those
who are at risk for hypercoagulability. The most common clinical symptoms at presentation include headaches
(90%) and seizures (40%). In more severe cases, focal deficits, depressed mental status and progression to
coma might occur. Systemic anticoagulation is the mainstay of the treatment, which is used for preventing
thrombus while facilitating recanalization. A substantial subset of patients may further deteriorate and at least
20% die or become disabled, with the highest mortality occurring during the acute phase of the illness. This
epidemiological landscape emphasizes the potential need of alternative acute therapeutic approaches to aid this
high-risk working-age CVST population.
Alternative therapies such as the use of new anticoagulants and/or Intravenous antiplatelet agents are promising
options in refractory patients when instituted early in the disease process. However, given the potential adverse
effects and elevated cost, an optimization of clinical decision tools that permit us to accurately stratify high-risk
CVST patients, represents the mandatory first step. To ameliorate this selection process, research efforts have
focused in the identification of clinical and radiological predictors to build a reliable prediction model.
Unfortunately, initial stratification scores have failed to demonstrate enough accuracy to be implemented into
clinical practice due to several conceptual constraints during model building and selection. A detail description
of the rigor of previous research will be presented in the significance section of this proposal.
After a thorough feasibility analysis of our CVST cohort at the University of Iowa, we are eager to propose a 2-
year study to develop and validate a new, simple, reproducible predictive score that will promptly stratify CVST
patients with poor outcome. The scale will be built on novel clinical and radiological biomarkers that appear
during early pathophysiological stages from two large CVST cohorts. We will also utilize innovative statistical
machine learning methodology to optimize our model selection and scale predictive performance. Finally, we will
evaluate our model in an independent subset of patients for further validation, refinement and generalizability.
Successful completion of this project will optimize the early selection of high-risk CVST patients before secondary
injury expands and perpetuates. Prior to implementation, an external validation of the scale in a larger multicenter
validation study will represent the first necessary critical step to open a window of opportunity to compare new
therapies against current clinical practice through RTCs in a significant group of young patients with otherwise
dismal outcome."
10756077,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Loss of pancreatic β cell function and/or mass is central to the development of type 2
diabetes (T2D). Understanding how β cell function is normally regulated in adult human islets will help
elucidate mechanisms of dysfunction in T2D, which are not well understood. A large body of work in mouse
models suggests that the islet-enriched transcription factor (TF) NKX2.2 is a critical regulator of β cell
development and plays a role in the maintenance of adult β cell function. Further, patients with loss-of-function
NKX2-2 mutations have neonatal diabetes, highlighting an important role of NKX2.2 in human islet
development. However, the role of NKX2.2 in adult human β cells remain undefined. Interestingly, we found
increased insulin secretion from primary human pseudoislets following global NKX2-2 knockdown, suggesting
different roles of NKX2.2 across species and developmental stages. We hypothesize that, in adult human
islets, NKX2.2 regulates insulin secretion via transcriptional repression of β cell-intrinsic pathways. To test this
hypothesis, we will first determine the role of NKX2.2 in adult human islet function in a β cell-specific manner.
Using florescence-activated cell sorting and CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we will perform targeted knockout of
NKX2-2 in adult β cells in primary human pseudoislets. We will assess β cell intracellular Ca2+ signaling events
and function in vitro using an integrated live cell imaging and microfluidic platform. To evaluate the impact of
chronic loss of NKX2.2, we will examine pseudoislet function in vivo following transplantation into
immunodeficient mice. Results of this aim will determine the impact of NKX2.2 on β cell-intrinsic pathways that
lead to insulin secretion. Secondly, we will define molecular mechanisms of NKX2.2 function in adult human β
cells using a single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq+ ATAC-seq multiome approach on the same nucleus. snRNA-seq
will determine if NKX2.2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of insulin secretory machinery in β cells. In
combination, snATAC-seq will reveal how NKX2.2 alters chromatin accessibility to regulate the β cell
transcriptome. To study the impact of chronic NKX2-2 knockout on β cell phenotype and function, we will
analyze harvested pseudoislet transplants for changes in proteins corresponding to top differentially expressed
genes of interest. This aim will provide mechanistic insight into how NKX2.2 regulates adult human β cell gene
transcription and function at the chromatin and transcript level. Overall, these studies will reveal molecular
mechanisms of NKX2.2 function in adult human β cells, with implications for new therapeutic approaches to
improve β cell function in T2D. Training under this fellowship will be enhanced by a rich environment, including
a large community of islet biology investigators under the NIH-funded Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and
Training Center, collaborations with experts in the field, and a variety of opportunities to promote career
development, leadership, and scientific communication. Together, the proposed research, training plan, and
environment will provide a strong foundation on which to base a career as a physician-scientist."
10830981,"The Boston Lung Cancer Survival (BLCS) cohort is a Cancer Epidemiology Cohort of more than 12,000 lung
cancer cases enrolled at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute since 1992.
This rich resource enables research to understand lung cancer heterogeneity that has already identified
valuable prognostic markers and stimulated new treatment strategies. For example, the BLCS supported the
first discovery of the association between EGFR mutations and response to therapy with EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors and enabled research on effective treatments for non-small cell lung cancer patients with ALK and
ROS1 rearrangements. In 2017, the cohort evolved into a survivor epidemiology cohort that is sustained by a
U01 grant until May 2023. Our progress during the first U01 funding cycle (2017–2022) is substantial—we
have published over 100 papers, supported 6 new grants, and worked with 50 collaborators nationally and
internationally. With the U01 award expiring soon, there is an urgency to renew to: 1) maintain this first and
most comprehensive lung cancer survivor cohort with the longest follow-up period—an unmatched source of
data for translational research; 2) establish an innovative, detailed phenotyping database via automated image
analysis of high-resolution computed tomography, as well as a radiomics database; 3) enable the established
infrastructure to facilitate internal and external investigators to pilot methodologic approaches that will turn into
productive multidisciplinary project grants by focusing on survival and treatment toxicity; and 4) leverage the
Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Lung Program resources for creative multidisciplinary collaborations
focused on treatment outcomes. Renewed funding is also critical to recruit 2,500 new cases (for a total of
14,500 cases) to this already large cohort. New cases are vitally important to: 1) facilitate comparison of new
treatments and traditional therapy as well as evaluation of new clinical investigation in an ever-changing
therapeutic environment; 2) allow us to collect more cases with driver mutation data, as well as those treated
with immune checkpoint inhibitors; 3) promote collection of repeated biological samples to support developing
prognostic/predictive biomarkers; 4) allow us to collect detailed data enabling assessment of environmental
determinants as well as racial and socioeconomic determinants of survival; and 5) empower our studies to
identify radiomic, genomic, epigenetic, and other phenomic biomarkers, environmental determinants, and racial
and socioeconomic determinants that are relevant to patient survival to guide improved lung cancer screening
and treatment strategies. The BLCS is one of the largest lung cancer survival cohorts and encompasses a
wealth of biomarker, tumor molecular characterization, imaging, lung function, genetic, epigenetic, traditional
epidemiologic risk factor, and electronic health record data. With continued support, this comprehensive cohort
will provide unique opportunities to explore predictors of lung cancer survival and treatment outcomes,
catalyzing powerful translational research that improves the health of individuals with lung cancer."
10925142,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the many exciting advances in gene editing technologies since the advent of CRISPR-Cas9, the
field has been hampered by an inability to catalyze programmable and predictable insertion of large DNA
payloads without generating double-strand breaks (DSBs). The use of DSB-generating editing tools has
unearthed substantial safety concerns, including the presence of large on-target genomic deletions and off-target
insertions and deletions. Additionally, Cas9-based approaches for editing diseases that are caused by a large
diversity of mutations in a gene, like cystic fibrosis (CF), require individual guide RNAs tailored to each allele,
which makes this technology prohibitive as a broadly accessible clinical tool. For CF, optimizing a gene editing
technology with the ability to perform DSB-independent, programmable, targeted insertion of large cargos would
allow the advent of a universal CF cure regardless of a patient’s mutation(s) by inserting a functional copy of
CFTR cDNA at the endogenous locus.
 The recent discovery and development of CRISPR-associated transposons offers an exciting new
strategy to insert large genetic cargos (>10kb) with high integration efficiencies and virtually no off-target events.
This proposal aims to systematically optimize RNA-guided transposases, referred to as INTEGRATE, in human
cells to achieve therapeutically relevant editing efficiencies, and to apply them for the universal correction of
CFTR gene mutations. Aim 1 will focus on a rigorous optimization of DNA insertion efficiencies by improving
protein delivery and colocalization of the INTEGRATE effector complex. A critical component of this aim will be
comprehensively assessing on- and off-target editing events. Aim 2 will direct the targeted insertion of full-length
CFTR cDNA at the endogenous gene locus in human bronchial epithelial cells, and quantify the production of
mature CFTR and the restoration of physiologic CFTR ion channel activity. This study will pave the way for the
continued development of RNA-guided transposase gene editing technologies for the DSB-independent
universal correction of CF, which carries broad applicability to other genetic diseases."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that is aggressive and difficult to treat, with
limited treatment options beyond traditional chemotherapy. Given the recent approval of treatment of TNBC with
the immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1, combined with nab-paclitaxel, we are evaluating
strategies that prime tumors to be more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Overactivation of the
PI3K/AKT pathway is implicated in about 23.7% of TNBC tumors and is known to contribute to the maintenance
of an immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). This proposal will investigate the hypothesis
that pan-AKT inhibition (AKTi) will enhance the efficacy of treatment with existing immune checkpoint inhibitors
in some but not all preclinical models of TNBC, including mouse models and patient-derived organoid models.
Experiments proposed in aim 1 will investigate how pan-AKTi affects the TIME when used in conjunction with
anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA4, and a combination of anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA4 (ICI). In vivo murine studies will be
performed in AKTi responsive PYMT tumors and AKTi non-responsive EO771, 4T1, and 6DT1 tumors. Multi-
color flow cytometry will allow detailed immunophenotyping of tumor and peripheral sites such as blood,lymph
node, and spleen. Additionally, In vitro studies with T-cells will explore the mechanisms through which AKTi may
enhance ICI efficacy as well as mechanisms of resistance to AKTi. In aim 2, a high throughput screen will be
used to identify potential candidate drugs that enhance T cell-mediated tumor cell killing and therefore have the
potential to enhance the efficacy of existing immune checkpoint inhibitors. A number of pan-AKT inhibitors as
well as candidate drugs identified in the screen will be evaluated in patient-derived organoid models established
from TNBC patients undergoing surgical resection. We will look for synergism between AKTi with immune
checkpoint inhibition, evaluating direct AKTi-mediated tumor cell killing and immune-mediated tumor cell killing.
These studies will enhance our understanding of mechanisms of response and resistance to AKTi in TNBC and
the role of AKT inhibition in priming the tumor immune environment to enhance response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. We will identify alternative inhibitors that enhance TNBC response to ICI for those tumors that do not
respond to AKTi. By examining the response of these therapies in organoid models of human TNBC, we will be
able to predict parameters of response to therapy in a heterogenous population of TNBC patients."
10830326,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than 80,000 births in the US occur annually as a result of assisted reproductive technology (ART). The
success of ART typically requires multiple expensive cycles that together exceed many US families’ yearly
household incomes. The necessity of multiple ART cycles stems in part from an insufficient number of healthy
preimplantation embryos. Healthy embryos are a direct product of the highest-quality gametes, yet limited
methods exist to identify the highest-quality sperm. Within the female reproductive tract, sperm with the highest
fertilization competence are naturally selected based on functional parameters – motility patterns, chemotaxis,
and the acrosome reaction. The best fertilization-competent sperm also have the lowest levels of oxidative and
DNA damage. Unfortunately, current clinical methods for selecting sperm for intracytoplasmic sperm injection
(ICSI) do not leverage these parameters. The broad objective of this application is to define the biochemical
mechanisms by which sperm undergo motility switching and fertilization competence, and results will both
advance the state of basic knowledge and enable optimization of in vitro sperm selection techniques. The
optimization of sperm selection for ART will in turn: 1) increase production of healthy embryos; 2) reduce average
numbers of costly cycles; and thus 3) lessen the cost burden on lower-income families. In Aim 1, we will utilize
complementary comprehensive bioenergetic phenotyping, computer assisted motility analysis (CASA), and a
novel dehydrogenase screen to define the underlying mechanisms through which metabolites predictably
modulate the essential motility patterns of mouse sperm. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that predictable
motility changes in response to metabolites can be used to select the best mouse sperm – those with normal
morphology and low levels of DNA damage, the ability to navigate towards a chemotactic signal and initiate
hyperactive motility, and complete the acrosome reaction. We will then employ in vitro fertilization (IVF) to
determine whether mouse sperm selected based on these metabolism-based motility traits have enhanced ability
to generate healthy embryos. In Aim 3, we will exploit our experience working with mouse sperm to define the
fundamental differences in the metabolism-based motility responses of human sperm. This project is expected
to identify the mechanisms connecting microenvironment to sperm function and thereby provide proof-of-concept
for the rapid development of methods to optimize clinical selection of fertilization-competent human sperm for
ART."
10764814,"ABSTRACT
Maintenance of normal hematopoiesis depends on developmental programs for the hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cell (HSPC). Still, these programs require guidance by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that correctly convey
the dynamically changing needs of the blood cells. Our prior work established that the hepatocyte-specific
Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR), a multimeric endocytic receptor, binds to aged platelets, inducing JAK-STAT
signaling and production of thrombopoietin (TPO), the cytokine responsible for megakaryocyte maturation and
differentiation, platelet production, and maintenance of HSPCs. In addition to regulating TPO production and
removing aged platelets, we uncovered an unexpected mechanism by which the AMR regulates erythropoiesis.
Our preliminary data suggest a role for the hepatic AMR in regulating Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) levels, the specific
ligand for ErbB4 (also known as HER4), the fourth member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR/HER1), ErbB2/HER2, and ErbB3/HER3. A genome-wide
association study (GWAS) shows that NRG4 variants are associated with changes in hemoglobin levels, and
ErbB4 signaling contributes to human and mouse erythropoiesis.
Our data shows that an increase in Nrg4 affects ErbB4 expression and signaling in bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs), leading to defective erythropoiesis and increased expression levels of S100a8 and S100a9,
members of the calcium-binding S100 protein family, known as Calgranulin A and B, respectively. Recombinant,
extracellular, and increased S100a8 expression levels in erythrocyte progenitors induce an erythroid
differentiation defect. We seek to define how Nrg4/ErbB4 affects HSPC homeostasis and erythropoiesis,
including erythroblastic islands (Aim 1). We will interrogate the mechanism by which Nrg4/ErbB4 affect MSC
function, calgranulin expression, and erythropoiesis (Aim 2). We use a multipronged approach of genetic mouse
modeling, inhibitors, transcriptomics, and biochemical approaches to allow mechanistic exploration into the
participation of the Nrg4/ErbB4/calgranulin axis in contributing to erythropoiesis. The proposed investigation will
further drive therapeutic development to ameliorate erythropoietic deficiencies in blood disease, including in
patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndrome."
10837084,"There are well-known sex differences in methamphetamine use disorder (MUD); women initiate use at an earlier age, transition to dependence faster, and exhibit a more severe course of addiction than men. Historically, men have used methamphetamine (MA) at higher rates than women, however this is no longer true among young adults under age 25. Data also show significant increases in MA use among women over age 25 and a five-fold increase in MA- associated overdose deaths in recent years. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand why women are vulnerable to MA use to improve women’s public health. Cyclical fluctuations in female sex hormones are one factor that contributes to sex differences in MUD; estrogen (E2) promotes while progesterone (P4) dampens sensitivity of brain dopamine systems to dopamine agonists (MA). So, clinical studies have probed the efficacy of P4 as a potential treatment for stimulant use disorders in women but with equivocal findings. However, few studies have assessed the influence of synthetic ovarian hormones e.g., progestins, the active component of hormonal contraceptive medications, on sensitivity to stimulant drug reward. This is surprising since a majority of US women use oral contraceptives (birth control pill, BCP) at some point in their reproductive life and the effects of E2 and P4 on brain neurobiology and drug effects are well documented. The long-term goal of this research is to fill the knowledge gap of how synthetic ovarian hormones influence MA effects and use. The first step toward this goal is to systematically determine how synthetic ovarian hormones influence the rewarding and motivational effects of MA in a controlled laboratory setting. The objective of this study is to determine how BCP influences MA subjective experiences and motivation for MA. The rationale is that vital data of how synthetic hormones influence the abuse potential of MA will inform novel women-focused prevention and treatment approaches. The working hypothesis is that progestin mimics the effects of P4 and blunts the rewarding subjective effects of MA and motivation to obtain MA. This hypothesis is based upon the existing preclinical and clinical data of P4 effects on stimulant drug reward and also pilot data from the PI’s lab. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the subjective rewarding effects of MA and motivation to obtain MA among women using BCP tested during active pill weeks vs. inactive pill weeks, in comparison to naturally cycling women tested at two phases of the menstrual cycle, 2) To determine how circulating natural and synthetic hormones are related to the rewarding subjective effects and motivational effects of MA. This research is significant because it will provide fundamental knowledge of how synthetic ovarian hormones influence responses to MA in women. The results will be clinically significant as they apply to a substantial proportion of US women who currently use BCP or cycle naturally. This study is innovative because it is the first systematic study of how natural and synthetic ovarian hormones influence MA reward and motivation, and shifts the focus of clinical research on sex differences in MUD from the effects of natural hormones to synthetic hormones. Finally, positive findings that high stable levels of synthetic progestin blunt MA reward will provide a framework for the development of therapies focused on female mechanisms."

workforce, whereas Hispanic psychologist represent 5% and Hispanic social workers 14% of their
corresponding workforce. Numbers are similar in the research workforce with only 6% of all NIH funds being
awarded to Hispanic investigators. To mitigate this underrepresentation of Hispanic/Latinx investigators
interested in mental health, we propose to partner with the American Society of Hispanic Psychiatry (ASHP) to
enhance their annual meeting with a personalized and highly focused mentoring program. This mentoring
program will take place annually over one and a half days, in which 12 junior Hispanic/Latinx investigators will
be competitively selected out of a larger pool of applicants and invited to present their work. Mentor-mentee
pairs will be formed based on the area of interest, the type of research being done, and the expertise of the
mentor. In addition, several other didactic activities will take place during the program, including a keynote
lecture, a grant writing workshop, a poster session, and a series of lunch tables for networking as well as to
discuss topics relevant to junior investigators. At the end of the meeting, mentor-mentee pairs will determine
career goals for the mentee and will meet virtually every 6 months to discuss the progress of agreed goals and
to discuss any changes in career trajectory. The specific aims of the program are: 1): To identify 12 junior
Hispanic/Latinx investigators interested in mental health research every year and provide them financial
support to attend and present at the ASHP annual meeting; 2) To engage 12 Hispanic/Latinx investigators
every year in mentorship activities during the ASHP conference; 3) To follow up on the outcome of the junior
Hispanic/Latinx investigators in metrics such as peer-reviewed publications, NIH and other agencies grant
support, scientific presentations, and academic advancement; 4) To develop a network of Hispanic/Latinx
mentors and mentees to support the academic advancement of the mentees. We believe that a highly focused
and personalized mentoring program in the context of the ASHP annual meeting will be a great strategy to train
and mentor rising Hispanic/Latinx investigators. We have assembled a group of prominent Hispanic/Latinx
investigators and mentors in the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Social Work, who will not only provide
the best mentorship experience but also serve as role models for junior Hispanic/Latinx investigators.
Therefore, we are confident that this mentoring program will help increase the representation of
Hispanic/Latinx investigators in the workforce."
10917364,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly heterogeneous in that its symptoms are highly varied and, often, non-
overlapping across individuals. In theory, this phenotypic heterogeneity reflects the influence of multiple
underlying causes, or etiologic mechanisms. This etiologic complexity makes AUD treatment very challenging;
researchers have identified AUD’s etiologic complexity as the most critical barrier to progress in developing more
effective, personalized treatments. Addiction theorists have identified a set of alcohol addiction research domain
criteria (AARDoC) functional domains, believed to be important etiologic mechanisms for AUD. Yet, existing
models meant to link these mechanisms to AUD-related behaviors and symptoms fail to consider etiology.
Hence, many basic questions concerning the etiology of problematic drinking and AUD-related symptoms remain
unresolved. The proposed work aims to identify the prospective contributions of functional domain neuro-
behavioral indicators to the etiology of heavy drinking (HD) and AUD-related symptoms during adolescence and
emerging adulthood, the decade of development when HD and AUD-related symptoms are most prevalent. We
will enroll a target sample of 480 adolescents and emerging adults (160 in each of three partially overlapping
age cohorts [50% female], pre-screened for elevated HD risk) to participate in a prospective study using an
accelerated longitudinal design, which will allow us to characterize trajectories of alcohol involvement and AUD-
related symptoms over a 10-year period of development within a five-year study. We will use a neuroclinical
assessment approach to comprehensively characterize four functional domains—cognitive control/disinhibition
(DIS), reward sensitivity (RS), anxiety (ANX), and incentive salience (IS)—using validated and reliable self-
report, behavioral, and neurophysiological measures during each of three waves of data collection (15 months
apart). Alcohol involvement, AUD-related symptoms, and social-environment factors will be assessed at 5-month
intervals. Using this multi-wave, multimodal approach, we will address three specific aims: (1) characterize the
influence of the functional domains on the etiology of alcohol involvement; (2) accounting for the influence of
alcohol involvement, characterize the influence of the functional domains on the etiology of AUD-related
symptoms; and (3) characterize the influence of HD on functional domain neurobehavioral indicators. Analyses
will characterize how various combinations of domain indicators affect latent states of alcohol involvement
(volume of consumption; patterns of use) and AUD-related symptoms (numbers of symptoms; clusters of
symptoms) and transitions across latent states over time. This work will produce a unique and rich dataset, and
its findings will directly inform the development of personalized intervention and treatment strategies that can be
deployed to target the functioning of specific domains during periods when their influence is greatest."

Psychiatric diseases are complex brain disorders associated with maladaptive plasticity of the brain circuit for
which we lack predictive preclinical measures of clinical efficacy. To fill this gap, we need to use molecular
knowledge to inform development of novel probes in order to interrogate the mechanisms that underlie circuit
deficits in these disorders and drive advanced therapeutic design. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) within ion
channel complexes fine-tune neuronal excitability and are emerging as links to the biology of psychiatric
disorders. Their highly specific and flexible interfaces make protein-channel interactions ideal targets for probe
development. Such molecular probes would provide the neuropharmacology community with optimal research
tools to parse out brain disease complexities and enable more effective drug design.
We have identified the PPI between the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) Nav1.6 channel and its accessory regulator
protein, fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) as a functionally relevant regulator of excitability of medium spiny
neurons (MSN) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc); a central component of the mesocorticolimbic circuit whose
dysfunction has been associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. Through a
bioluminescence-based high-throughput screen (HTS) and a round of chemical optimization we have identified
the new brain permeable probe 1028 that modulates FGF14:Nav1.6 channel complex formation and increases
Nav1.6 channel availability and MSN firing. When systemically administrated, 1028 increases accumbal
neuron firing and promotes hedonic states in situations lacking motivation, suggesting the compound can
modulate reward-related behaviors within the mesocorticolimbic circuit. Here, we are proposing to further
optimize 1028 for in vivo use by improving its potency and metabolic stability and determine its mechanism of
action at the molecular (Aim 1), cellular (Aim 2), circuital, and behavioral levels (Aim 3). Outcomes of this
proposed research will generate the first-in-class brain-permeant chemical probes to interrogate the reward
circuit, providing the foundation for pre-therapeutic development of a new class of PPI-based leads for a broad
spectrum of psychiatric disorders."

(SWEHSC) is integral to developing and maintaining the relationships that allow SWEHSC to meet its mission
of determining the human health impacts of environmental exposures among underserved populations in arid
environments experiencing climate change. The CEC addresses structural environmental inequalities by
facilitating multidirectional and culturally-anchored engagement between SWEHSC researchers, the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and Southwestern educators, public health professionals, community
members, and policy makers. The SWEHSC is in the arid Southwest, a region that is home to high proportions
of Indigenous, Latinx, and rural communities living in understudied environmental conditions that include
exposures to unique toxicants. Primary health concerns in these communities include cancer, diabetes,
autoimmune diseases, reproductive disorders, and respiratory disease that can result from exposures to extreme
heat, airborne pollutants, pesticides, forest fire smoke, dust storms, and drinking water contaminants such as
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and arsenic. The CEC vision is to combine respect for Indigenous science,
traditional ecological knowledge, “funds of knowledge,” and citizen observation/inquiry with modern scientific
advances to engage Indigenous, Latinx, and rural communities and to design materials and programs to work
towards environmental justice for these communities. The CEC applies this vision through four aims: 1) using
multi-directional communication strategies to assure that SWEHSC investigators address the environmental
health (EH) issues of greatest concern impacting our target communities; 2) ensuring the dissemination of key
research findings to our target communities so that they may better protect their health; 3) evaluating the
effectiveness of our risk and safety communication and report-back strategies to ensure that these
communications effectively promote public health; and 4) assuring self-determination by training the next
generation of EH scientists from these communities. In realizing these aims, the CEC equips the next generation
of EH scientists with the necessary engagement skills and scientific knowledge to address structural
environmental inequalities affecting the desert Southwest populations and to achieve sustainable EH justice."

themes; and 4) enable the pursuit of innovative new EHS research directions. Funds to the PPP have been used
successfully to recruit new SWEHSC members and dramatically increase funding from NIEHS and other federal
sponsors to Center members. PPP funded Pilot Projects from the last 10 years have resulted in 19 new ES-
designated grants to date. Due to the remarkable success of the SWEHSC PPP, SWEHSC has also received
generous institutional support from the University of Arizona (UA) and each of the colleges to support the PPP.
The PPP application process is designed to maximize support to early-career investigators and established
investigators who are new to EHS research. The PPP also collaborates with the Community Engagement Core

10868760,"This application for renewal seeks to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms of nicotine addiction. A major accomplishment during the previous funding cycle was identifying the critical role played by the habenula-interpeduncular nucleus (habenula-IPn) circuit in regulating the motivational properties of nicotine. We also found that the neuropeptide glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), released from neurons that arise in the nucleus of the solidary tract (NTS), enhances the activity of the habenula-IPn circuit and thereby inhibits nicotine intake. Transcription factor 7-like 2 (Tcf7l2) is considered a core component of the GLP-1 signaling cascade. In exciting new preliminary data, we find that Tcf7l2 is highly enriched in the habenula-IPn circuit. Using a new line of Tcf7l2 knockout (Tcf7l2-/-) rats, we also find that disruption of Tcf7l2 signaling dramatically increases the motivation to consume nicotine. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Tcf7l2 in the habenula of wild- type rats similarly increases nicotine intake. These exciting new findings suggest that habenular Tcf7l2 signaling plays a critical role in regulating the motivational properties of nicotine. In this competitive renewal, we will use cutting-edge molecular, cellular and behavioral approaches to investigate the mechanisms of Tcf7l2 action. In AIM I, we will investigate cellular mechanisms of Tcf7l2 action. First, we will confirm that virus- mediated re-expression of Tcf7l2 specifically in the habenula of Tcf7l2-/- rats rescues their otherwise increased motivation to consume nicotine. Second, we will investigate the role of Tcf7l2 in regulating the responsiveness of habenular neurons to self-administered nicotine. This will be accomplished by expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in the habenula of wild-type and Tcf7l2-/- rats and using in vivo fiber photometry to quantify calcium transients evoked by self-administered nicotine. Third, we will identify the precise population of habenular neurons in which Tcf7l2 acts to control nicotine intake. This will be accomplished by using in vivo CRISPR to delete Tcf7l2 in genetically defined populations of habenular neurons of mice and characterizing their nicotine intake. In AIM II, we will identify transcriptional mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 acts in habenula to control nicotine intake. We will use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq on habenula tissues from wild-type and Tcf7l2-/- rats to identify habenular genes directly regulated by Tcf7l2. In AIM III, we will identify molecular mechanisms by which Tcf7l2 controls nicotine intake. We will use in vivo CRISPR to delete the most promising Tcf7l2 target genes in habenula, or perturb signaling networks in which target genes are enriched, and assess the impact on nicotine intake. This highly innovative renewal builds logically on the substantial progress made during the previous cycle and promises to yield significant new insights into the mechanisms of nicotine addiction."

The lack of biosensors fundamentally limits the reach of engineering into biology. The need to sense and
measure biochemicals is central to applications spanning healthcare, biotechnology, drug development,
environmental management, agriculture, food and water safety, consumer technology. Hormone
measurements, in particular, are essential to fertility planning and assisted reproductive technologies; one
million women in the U.S. suffer from infertility and another 7.5 million women suffer from decreased fertility.
Quantitative measures of hormone levels are also critical to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of
endocrine disorders and hormone imbalances that affect up to 20% of the population. Real-time, low-cost, and
portable monitoring of hormones levels would enable fundamentally new approaches to fertility planning and
the management of endocrine disorders. A critical limiting factor is the lack of adequate hormone biosensors.
Bacteria have evolved over 3 billion years to detect and respond to virtually all classes of stimuli relevant to our
own biology, including hormones. We have developed an approach to identify and isolate bacterial sensing
proteins that recognize a target analyte and to develop these proteins into in vitro biosensors. We have used
this approach to develop a novel hormone sensor for progesterone and we have demonstrated that this sensor
is reproducible, stable, unaffected by interferents in urine, and can provide real-time hormone measurements
using an inexpensive and portable electronic reader consistent with requirements for a point-of-care device.
Our results thus provide proof-of-concept for a novel class of hormone biosensors adaptable to inexpensive
realtime, point-of-care or consumer health devices.
We will apply our approach to develop a novel class of clinically and commercially viable steroid hormone
biosensors for applications in fertility planning, assisted reproductive technologies, and endocrine disorders.
We will demonstrate the utility of our novel sensors by developing a point-of-care microfluidic device for real
time hormone measurements from urine."

 Developing effective cancer therapies remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity of tumor
physiology, cytotoxicity towards non-cancer cells, and the emergence of drug resistance, all of which hamper
positive patient outcome. Thus, there is a critical need for novel anticancer agents with alternate mechanisms
of action. Targeting the DNA replication initiation pathway is an underexplored strategy for cancer therapy.
Origin licensing, the first step of DNA replication initiation during which the replicative helicase Mcm2-7 is
loaded onto replication origins, is of particular interest because its inhibition is selectively cytotoxic towards
cancer cell lines. However, no origin licensing inhibitors have been developed for clinical therapy yet, which is
in part due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding of DNA replication initiation in metazoans. Contrary to
S. cerevisiae, which has been used extensively to study replication initiation both at the biochemical and
structural level, no structures of metazoan origin licensing intermediates containing Mcm2-7 on-pathway to
helicase loading have been solved. How small-molecule origin licensing inhibitors bind and inhibit Mcm2-7
loading factors is likewise unknown. These gaps in knowledge have impeded the development of effective drug
candidates targeting replication initiation. The goal of this proposal is to uncover structural insights into
metazoan origin licensing. A deep understanding of metazoan origin licensing will aid in the
development of small-molecule inhibitors targeting DNA replication initiation complexes and in
defining the mechanisms by which these inhibitors act. These results will contribute to the long-term goal
of developing origin licensing inhibitors as a new class of cancer drugs."

The DLPFC is a true six layered neocortex, and neurons in different cortical layers show distinct expression
patterns, morphology, physiology and patterns of connectivity. Converging evidence suggests that impairments
in the formation or maintenance of synapses may be involved in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric
disorders. Studies in the postmortem brains of subjects have pointed to specific cell types and revealed
differences in neuronal and synaptic structure that are localized to specific layers, suggesting that genetic risk
for schizophrenia may manifest with laminar specificity. Given the close relationship between brain structure
and function, precisely assigning gene expression to the spatial coordinates of individual cell populations within
this cortical cytoarchitecture would significantly advance our understanding of how dysregulation in these areas
contributes to debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders. In this application, we propose to generate detailed
spatial transcriptomics maps of the human DLPFC in patients with schizophrenia (SCZD), bipolar (BPD), major
depressive (MDD) and autism spectrum (ASD) disorders, and contrast these laminar expression patterns to
those derived from matched neurotypical controls (CONT). We will use the 10x Genomics Visium platform,
which combines transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing with detailed high-resolution histology and
immunofluorescence imaging, to generate these spatial transcriptomics profiles. We will combine these
topographic and cell type-specific maps to implicate layer- and cell type-specific populations in psychiatric
disorder genetic risk and illness state that will be validated using complementary quantitative in situ
hybridization techniques. These layer-specific and cell type-specific expression profiles can refine the
molecular causes and consequences of debilitating neuropsychiatric disorders that can be targeted for
prevention and treatment."

Major challenges facing nephrology today are declining interest in the field and lack of innovation and novel
drug and device development. These factors may be related. Students who perceive nephrology as stagnant
may be attracted to other specialties, thereby robbing the nephrology workforce of talented students who could
innovate and advance the field. The R25 Funding Opportunity Announcement by NIDDK to spark interest in
nephrology is therefore timely and an exciting opportunity to address a major need in the evolution of
nephrology and the care of patients with kidney diseases. We propose the development of the Boston
University Kidney and Medical Engineering Program (BU-KIDMEP). Our ultimate goal is to inspire talented
young scholars to improve the lives of individuals with kidney disease through innovative technology solutions.
To accomplish this, we have designed a program that: 1) Identifies students interested in technology and
engineering across Boston University, with an emphasis on undergraduates; 2) Pairs students with a
mentoring team comprised of a research/technology expert and a nephrology expert; 3) Fosters a 6- to 24-
month long education program that includes didactic training, clinical immersion, and technology development;
4) Showcases research at capstone symposia; and 5) Tracks metrics to improve the program's success in
attracting students to technology and kidney disease."
10808921,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chronic low back pain (cLBP), lasting more than 12 weeks, is associated with high monetary (up to $200 billion
annually in the USA) and non-monetary societal and personal costs such as decreased quality of life, lowered
self-worth, reduced productivity, stigma, depression, and accelerated aging. Individuals in the USA who
identify with an African American/Black racial background experience more frequent, severe, and disabling
cLBP compared to other racial groups, particularly Caucasians/Whites. This difference underscores the
substantially higher burden of cLBP among Blacks, which are exacerbated by low socioeconomic status,
stigma, and discrimination. However, there is a gap in knowledge relating to 1) the mechanisms that cause and
sustain racial differences in cLBP, and 2) the relative contributions of these factors for worse cLBP outcomes in
Blacks. Genetic and environmental factors influence chronic pain. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a type of
epigenetic mechanism by which environmental factors alter which genes are turned-on or turned-off without
changing the DNA sequence. Informed by our preliminary data and literature, we propose to prospectively
collect blood samples from an ongoing parent study (R01MD010441) to elucidate the mechanism that causes
and sustains racial differences in cLBP. Our central hypothesis is that Blacks experience more adverse
environmental exposures than Whites in the USA, which may induce DNAm changes that cause and sustain
more severe and disabling cLBP for Blacks. Our primary objective is to uncover novel epigenetic and gene
expression mechanisms that underlie racial differences in cLBP. We will use cutting edge technology, reduced
representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq), to determine DNAm and gene
expression changes. Our specific aims are 1) to determine racial group differences in DNAm and gene
expression between Blacks and Whites with and without cLBP, and 2) to determine if DNAm and gene
expression patterns are associated with stressful environmental exposures as well as severity of cLBP. To our
knowledge, no study has examined psychological, socioeconomic status, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data
in a racially diverse sample of adults with cLBP. Combining rigorous psychosocial data from the parent study,
with molecular information from this ancillary study, represents a paradigm shift in studies of racial differences
in cLBP. This project is significant, as it will increase our understanding of cLBP and may inform intervention
studies to reverse epigenomic changes that drive cLBP outcomes, which will allow a better quality of life for all
patients with cLBP."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as kidney damage or reduction in glomerular filtration rate for three
months or more, irrespective of cause. CKD affects an estimated 276 million people worldwide, leads to reduced
quality of life and increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. For many, CKD progresses to end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) and the need for dialysis and transplantation. Abnormal leak of protein into the urine (i.e.,
proteinuria) is associated with a worse prognosis and greater likelihood of progression to ESRD. While
proteinuric diseases are generally studied as a disease of the glomeruli and resident podocytes, we propose that
the renal tubules may also play a key role in promoting glomerular proteinuria. β-catenin is a transcription factor
active in tubular epithelia during kidney injury. Preliminary data show that tubule-specific β-catenin knockout
mice are protected from glomerular injury and proteinuria, suggesting that tubules can play a role in glomerular
disease. This protection was associated with reduced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-
1), and MCP-1 is known to adversely affect the resident podocytes of the glomerulus. Therefore, we hypothesize
that tubular-to-glomerular crosstalk in response to injury involves the β-catenin-mediated release of MCP-1 from
kidney tubules. This hypothesis will be tested through three aims. First, we will investigate the effect of β-catenin
on inducing MCP-1 expression in renal tubules. Second, we will assess the effect of MCP-1 on slit diaphragm
integrity. Third, we will investigate the contribution of tubule-specific MCP-1 in the development of glomerular
injury and podocyte dysfunction. This proposal will provide Dr. Bondi with the opportunity to acquire additional
experience with rodent models of kidney injury, establishing conditional genetic knockout mouse models, kidney
imaging, performing and analyzing data from both ChIP and ChIP-seq experiments as well as staying abreast of
the rapid, technological advances in molecular technologies. Dr. Bondi will personally interact with and be
mentored by a team of accomplished and experienced mentors, advisors, and collaborators to ensure successful
completion of the proposal. By having the K01 support, Dr. Bondi will be able to take advantage of core
resources, workshops, and courses offered within and outside of the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Bondi will
use this proposal to accomplish the short-term goal of acquiring additional technical and professional training,
and the long-term goal of becoming a leading primary investigator-educator in kidney disease with a fully-funded
laboratory, which maintains productivity, fosters collaborations, and provides mentorship. Overall, the results
from this proposal will not only form the basis for a R01 study but will lead to a new understanding of CKD and
provide important mechanistic data that is critical for the development of future therapeutic interventions for
proteinuric CKD."

Germinal centers (GCs) drive adaptive humoral immunity by selecting for B cells with high affinity antibodies and
producing memory B cells and plasma cells. We previously demonstrated that GC B cells can be subdivided into
three subpopulations that are functionally, spatially, transcriptionally, and epigenetically distinct. Thus, we asked
whether these unique epigenetic states are important for GC B cell function and differentiation. Our lab has also
previously characterized how the epigenetic reader BRWD1 regulates epigenetic states and enhancer
accessibility during the transition from large pre-B cells to small pre-B cells during B cell lymphopoiesis. Because
BRWD1 is highly expressed in GC B cells, we hypothesized that BRWD1 regulates chromatin accessibility in
GC B cells and is important for peripheral B cell differentiation. To study this, we generated Brwd1floxed mice to
delete Brwd1 in different B cell populations. First, deletion of Brwd1 in follicular B cells inhibited GC responses
with fewer GC B cells and smaller GCs observed by microscopy. Second, deletion of Brwd1 in GC B cells
promoted proliferation of GC B cells and blocked differentiation of Brwd1-/- GC B cells into memory B cells without
disrupting GC architecture. Furthermore, loss of Brwd1 caused an epigenetic collapse whereby differential
chromatin accessibility between GC B cell subpopulations was lost. From this preliminary data, we propose a
model where BRWD1 regulates chromatin accessibility at enhancers and transcription factor binding motifs in a
manner critical for the cell fate decisions of peripheral B cells. To test this model, first we will further study how
BRWD1 is important for B cell function and differentiation. In follicular B cells, we will characterize whether
BRWD1 is necessary for either the initial differentiation or early expansion and proliferation of GC B cells (Aim
1). In GC B cells, we will study whether BRWD1 is important for somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation
(Aim 2A). Furthermore, we will determine whether BRWD1 is necessary for development of pre-memory B cells
or memory B cell subsets (Aim 2B). Finally, we will characterize how BRWD1 establishes epigenetic states
between GC B cell subpopulations (Aim 3). We will characterize how BRWD1 binds at different sites and how
the histone marks that recruit BRWD1 change between GC zones. We will identify active and repressed
enhancers alongside our chromatin accessibility data to study how BRWD1 coordinates changes in enhancer
accessibility between GC B cell subpopulations. Completion of this proposed project will provide insight into
fundamental mechanisms central to the humoral immune response, autoimmunity, and lymphoma development
within the GC."
10830392,"Project Summary / Abstract
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are incurable, clinically challenging malignancies that are rising in incidence.
Although tumors grow slowly, they progress relentlessly and lack effective therapies once they become
metastatic. Many patients with advanced NETs will die from their disease. Greater understanding of
mechanisms driving NET progression and metastasis is needed to inform new therapies and improve patient
outcomes.
We discovered a RABL6A-PP2A pathway that promotes pancreatic NET (PNET) pathogenesis. RABL6A
(RAB-like GTPase) is upregulated in patient PNETs and is required for PNET proliferation and survival.
RABL6A acts through multiple mechanisms that are only partly defined, including inhibition of tumor
suppressors (p27, RB1) and activation of oncogenic pathways (MYC, AKT-mTOR). A common regulator of all
those factors is protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a powerful tumor suppressor whose role in NETs has not
been explored. We found that RABL6A activates AKT-mTOR signaling in PNETs by inhibiting PP2A. In turn,
RABL6A is down regulated by PP2A although the molecular mechanism by which these two proteins inhibit
each other's function is unknown. Excitingly, specific `small molecule activators of PP2A' (called SMAPs)
suppress PNET cell proliferation and survival in a RABL6A-dependent manner and abolish tumor growth in
vivo. These findings support a novel strategy for PNET therapy involving PP2A reactivation. However, the role
of RABL6A and PP2A in NET progression is only partly understood and their importance in NET metastasis is
not known. This multi-PI study draws upon the collective knowledge of both PIs and their unique expertise /
resources in NETs (Quelle) and PP2A (Narla) to test the central hypothesis that the RABL6A-PP2A
pathway is a critical driver of NET progression and response to targeted therapies. Aim 1 will determine
the mechanisms of RABL6A-PP2A reciprocal regulation. Aim 2 will define the roles and interdependence of
RABL6A and PP2A in NET progression and metastasis. Aim 3 will establish the importance of the RABL6A-
PP2A alterations in NET pathogenesis and the efficacy of pathway targeted combination therapies.
This project will provide new insights into molecular events driving NET progression and metastasis while
establishing the efficacy of promising NET therapeutics, thus addressing a critical gap in NET research that
may ultimately improve patient outcomes. Moreover, this work builds upon an emerging strategy for anticancer
therapy (i.e., pharmacological reactivation of PP2A), and may have broad cancer relevance beyond NETs
given the importance of RABL6A overexpression and PP2A inactivation in other tumor types."
10811724,"The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and
to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature
infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours.
NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which
reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases
the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.
 The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC,
including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several
classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in-
Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to
identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer
them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial
colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram
negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is
required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining
compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent
activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis
for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human
tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC
research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ
ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4-
dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet
(breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then
manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will
assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut
non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term
complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid
platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ
injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it."

leadership roles in the field of gerontology. To accomplish the proposed objectives and goals of
this research conference grant, we will develop recruitment approaches, training, mentoring,
evaluation, dissemination, and sustainability of the workshops (Aim 1); implement the GSA
MCD TAWs annually for five years and provide travel award support for 100 trainees (Aim 2);
we will regularly evaluate (and modify as needed) the workshops’ curriculum, faculty, trainees
and ongoing educational and mentoring activities delivered via surveys, webinars, focus groups,
and emailed questionnaires (Aim 3); we will facilitate dissemination of the workshops’
curriculum, outcomes, outputs and evaluation results via social media, webinars, lectures, white
paper reports, peer review publications, and presentations at scientific meetings (Aim 4).
We are requesting support from the NIA to assist with the recruitment, inclusion, and training of
talented early career investigators from URM backgrounds to receive travel fellowship awards to
participate in the GSA MCD TAW series. The travel awards will help trainees with hotel,
transportation, registration, and family care (i.e. childcare) expense."
10829372,"Project Summary
Recent large-scale trials have shown no significant benefit of pharmacological interventions in delirium
patients, and non-pharmacological approaches remain the cornerstone of delirium prevention. Among those
strategies, minimizing patient immobility and circadian desynchrony are particularly difficult to implement, as
their assessment is dependent on sporadic human observations. The overall objective of this application is to
develop ADAPT, the Autonomous Delirium Monitoring and Adaptive Prevention system using novel pervasive
sensing and deep learning techniques. It will autonomously quantify patients’ mobility and circadian
desynchrony in terms of nightly disruptions, light intensity, and sound pressure level. This will allow for
integration of these risk factors into a dynamic model for predicting delirium trajectories. It will also enable
adaptive action prompts aimed at increasing patients’ mobility, reducing nightly disruptions, optimizing ambient
light, and reducing noise, based on precise real-time quantification. The rationale is that successful application
of the proposed technology would augment clinical-decision making in the fast-paced ICU environment and
would promote more targeted interventions. The overall objective will be achieved by pursuing three specific
aims. (1) Developing and validating an interpretable deep learning algorithm for precise and dynamic prediction
of the delirium trajectory, to determine if it is more accurate in predicting delirium trajectory transitions
compared to existing tools, while providing interpretable information to the physician. (2) Developing a
pervasive sensing system for autonomous monitoring of mobility and circadian desynchrony, to determine if it
can provide accurate assessments compared to human expert and circadian biomarkers, and if it can enrich
delirium trajectory prediction when combined with clinical data. (3) Developing and evaluating prompts for
adaptive delirium prevention using real-time monitoring system, to determine if the system has acceptable
satisfaction and perceived benefit among ICU physicians. The approach is innovative, because it represents
the first attempt to (1) dynamically predict precise delirium trajectory, (2) autonomously monitor mobility and
circadian desynchrony risk factors in the ICU, and (3) implement adaptive preventions in real time. The
proposed research is significant since it will address several key problems and critical barriers in critical care,
including (1) lack of precise and real-time delirium trajectory prediction models, (2) uncaptured aspects of
mobility and circadian desynchrony, and (3) the need for novel approaches for non-pharmacological
prevention. Ultimately, the results are expected to improve patient outcomes and decrease hospitalization
costs, as well as lifelong complications."
10708089,"Hypoglycemia (HG) is common in the lives of people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and may prevent them from
achieving the benefits associated with optimal glycemic control. Recurrent HG over a few days to weeks may
lead to the condition of impaired awareness of HG (IAH) where the first sign of a low blood sugar is confusion or
unconsciousness. Avoiding HG is associated with a reduced risk of IAH and when strictly done, may restore HG
in some but not all patients with IAH. The reason for this heterogeneity in response remains uncertain.The
purpose of this application is to apply to become part of a consortium that will implement a protocol designed to
restore awareness of HG in persons with T1D and IAH. As instructed by the FOA, we address the following
objectives in our application:
1. Determine if diabetes care with use of the most up-to-date management strategies with T1D and IAH.
2. Determine the physiological factors that are associated with restoration of HG awareness, including but not
limited to age, duration of diabetes and metrics of glycemia.
3. Determine the association of the current self-report questionnaires (or develop new questionnaires or
metrics) for identification of IAH with measurement of CRR using ""state of the art"" metabolic assessments.
To meet objective 1, we propose the consortium enroll 650 subjects with T1D and IAH into a randomized clinical
trial where a 12-month intervention of HG avoidance education and use of a hybrid closed loop system for insulin
infusion is compared to standard care (which includes HG avoidance education, insulin administration via regular
pump or injections, and CGM usage). With epinephrine response during the hypoglycemic clamp at 12 months
as our primary outcome variable, we will test the hypothesis that subjects in the closed loop intervention
arm will have a greater epinephrine response during the hypoglycemic clamp at 12 months of follow-
up than will subjects in the control arm.
To meet objective 2, we will collect information about glycemic variability, food quality and quantity, physical
activity, sleep, stress, mood, and feelings about HG as well as patient characteristics such as HG induced
glucagon secretion, residual C-peptide secretion, and diabetes duration. This information will then be explored
using machine learning techniques to see what exposures and experiences correlate with IAH restoration.
To meet objective three, we will compare the concordance of the Clarke, Gold, and Hypo-AQ questionnaires at
categorizing subjects into IAH and NAH groups. The scores on each of the questionnaires will also be correlated
with objective measures of the counterregulatory response."
10841690,"Exploring mechanisms of cardiac pacemaker cell fate determination
PROJECT SUMMARY
Pacemaker (PM) cells reside within the sinoatrial node (SAN), which faithfully initiates over 3 billion heartbeats
during the human lifespan. PM dysfunction often necessitates device implantation to prevent circulatory collapse
from bradycardia. Despite the critical importance of cardiac PM function, the mechanisms by which PM cells
undergo lineage commitment remain obscure. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand the
mechanistic basis for cell fate determination within the cardiac conduction system. The overall objective for this
proposal is to explore molecular strategies for PM cell lineage commitment. There is an urgent need to elucidate
the molecular underpinnings of PM lineage commitment to understand the fundamental biology of PM fate de-
termination and to inform future development of new therapeutic strategies. My lab recently reported on key
mechanisms by which Hand2 regulates PM formation using conversion of fibroblasts into induced PM myocytes
(iPMs) as a model system. Building upon this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that Hand2 interacts
with AP-1 to promote subtype diversity and cooperatively binds genomic targets to orchestrate PM specification.
To test our central hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the mechanisms by which
Hand2 ensures cardiac subtype diversity, 2) Explore the basis for cardiac PM lineage commitment and alterna-
tive fate restriction, and 3) Boost iPM reprogramming by component annotation and combinatorial perturbation.
In Aim 1, we will use our iPM reprogramming system in conjunction with genomic occupancy analysis, co-im-
munoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry (ICC), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and confocal micros-
copy to define biochemical interactions, perturb cardiac reprogramming, and characterize the resulting cell fates.
In Aim 2, we will use scRNA-seq, cell fate trajectory mapping, ICC, genomic occupancy analysis, and protein-
binding microarrays (PBMs) to analyze lineage regulators, alternative fate repressors, and combinatorial inter-
actions during iPM reprogramming. In Aim 3, we will systematically annotate candidate factors curated from our
preliminary data and the literature. In parallel, we will build PM regulatory networks from the ground-up using
novel combinatorial genomic approaches that we have recently developed. Successful completion of the pro-
posed project will provide critical details regarding the establishment and maintenance of PM cell identity. This
contribution will be significant because it will provide detailed insight into how cell fate is accomplished and
identify potential regulators and mechanisms of PM specification. Furthermore, the proposed research is inno-
vative because our unique experimental approaches and multi-disciplinary research team promise to uncover
new principles in cell fate determination. Taken together, we anticipate that the results of the proposed project
will provide detailed knowledge of the gene regulatory networks that drive PM cell specification and guide future
development of novel strategies to engineer therapeutic replacement cells for sinus node dysfunction."
10814348,"Glioblastoma (GBM) remains incurable cancer with a dismal survival rate despite aggressive multimodal therapy
that can include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and tumor-treating fields. The failure to improve outcome in
GBM patients underscores an urgent need to develop new targeted therapies. Bi-specific T cell engager (BiTEs)
proteins promote specific killing of cancer cells by activated T cells via BiTE binding to both T-cells and tumor
cells. Because this type of therapy is at an early stage of development for solid tumors such as GBM, our
knowledge of tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics, and mechanism of action is limited, which hinders the rational
design of clinical studies for evaluating BiTEs. To advance BiTEs as a strategy for treating GBM, as well as other
solid tumors, we have engineered and characterized a single-chain antibody (scFv) that specifically targets
IL13Rα2, a cell surface receptor that is expressed on GBM cells, but not normal brain cells. We have generated
and tested several configurations of BiTE molecules targeting human or murine CD3 T cells. Our data show that
the IL13Rα2 BiTE i) binds specifically to human IL13Rα2 on GBM cells, ii) specifically activates T cells upon
engagement of the BiTE molecule with these IL13Rα2-expressing GBM cells, iii) mediates T-cell dependent
killing of GBM cells at pM concentrations, and iv) significantly improves the survival of mice bearing syngeneic
intracranial GBM tumors. Imaging data show that BiTEs penetrate through the blood-tumor barrier and also
engage T cells. Preliminary results also suggest that the mechanism of BiTE action is not limited to direct killing
of glioma cells by activated T cells but also affects the tumor microenvironment by activating additional host
immune function. Based on our robust preclinical data, we hypothesize that (i) GBM access of systemically
delivered BiTEs is a T-cell-dependent process, and (ii) BiTEs actively modulate T cell as well as other
host immune response compartments, leading to a robust anti-tumor therapeutic response in preclinical
GBM models. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. SA1 will investigate the dependencies of
IL13Rα2 BiTE on T cells for tumor access and retention, tumor uptake, and biodistribution. SA2 will study the
mechanism by which IL13Rα2 BiTE primes the host immune system to generate durable anti-tumor immunity.
In SA3, we will develop and identify a BiTE treatment regimen using murine and human models of GBM that
could subsequently be translated into a therapy for patients. Upon successful completion of these studies, we
will acquire knowledge regarding factors that influence BiTE anti-tumor activity. These studies will provide a
strong foundation for future clinical application of IL13Rα2 BiTE for GBM treatment and could be broadly
applicable to other IL13Rα2-expressing malignancies."
11083854,"The introduction of recombinant tissue plasminogenactivators (r-tPA, alteplase) 25 years ago, and the recent development of endovascular therapy (EVT), significantly reduced neurologic disability in patients with ischemic stroke. Still, only 20% of stroke patients in the US are eligible for these therapies and 70% of those treated are left disabled. Unfortunately, these therapies are also associated with toxic effects such as brain hemorrhage. For many patients, such as those who would be treated at 4.5-24 hours after stroke without large vessel occlusion, no established therapy exists. We urgently need to develop safer and more effective treatments that can lessen the suffering and enormous costs of disability after ischemic stroke. NINDS-funded research shows that a2-antiplasmin (a2AP) is a molecule that plays a crucial, deleterious role in acute ischemic stroke. High a2AP levels are linked to an increased risk of r-tPA failure clinically, and a2AP increases brain injury in a dose-dependent fashion in preclinical models. a2AP blocks thrombus dissolution ini- tiated by r-tPA and increases microvascular thrombosis. a2AP promotes neutrophil recruitment and matrix met- alloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, which enhances blood brain barrier breakdown to cause intracranial hem- orrhage. Conversely, a2AP deficiency, or a monoclonal antibody that inactivates a2AP (a2AP-I), profoundly reduces apoptosis, MMP-9 expression, microvascular thrombosis, hemorrhage and swelling by comparison to r-tPA or no treatment. Importantly, an a2AP-I has a several-fold longer therapeutic window than r-tPA. Compared to r-tPA, an a2AP-I significantly decreases brain infarction, brain hemorrhage, disability and mortality in preclinical stroke. Robust studies from multiple labs, using different models and tools, show consistent effects. Taken together, these data suggest that an a2AP-I alone has extraordinary potential for safe treatment of human ischemic stroke, particularly in an extended ischemic time window. The monoclonal antibody a2AP-I, TS23, was developed with NIH/NINDS research support. In a Phase I trial of healthy volunteers TS23 induced dose-related a2AP inactivation, amplified endogenous thrombus disso- lution, and was well-tolerated. A randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, Bayesian, dose-finding, Phase II SISTER trial within the NIH StrokeNet will test the central hypothesis that, when compared to standard medical care, TS23 will safely improve neurological outcomes in patients with extended ischemia, without completed infarction. TS23 will be compared to placebo in 300 acute ischemic stroke patients presenting 4.5-24 h after symptom onset with favorable perfusion imaging. If TS23 proves be safe and potentially efficacious, based on reduction of neurological impairment, a future, pivotal clinical trial will be planned."
10904638,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gammaherpesvirus infections are associated with a number of malignancies that include B-cell
lymphoproliferative diseases, gastric carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Immunodeficient individuals such
as HIV patients are more susceptible to γ -herpesviruses-associated cancers. It generally takes several months
to years for cancer to arise after primary infection with the virus. This observation highlights the multistep
process of carcinogenesis that could only be achieved by viral persistent infection. EBV and KSHV are γ -
herpesviruses that establish latent infection in lymphoid cell, which is maintained for the rest of the host’s life.
Intermittent reactivation of these viral reservoirs will lead to more viruses production and spreading. Although
there are antiviral drugs that specifically target lytic replication of γ -herpesviruses, they do not eliminate those
latent viruses that could serve as a risk factor for viral-associated cancers.
Our group recently showed that HIV infection leads to activation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a proto-
oncogene, in B and T-cell lymphocytes. PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that controls G2-M cell cycle
progression and is frequently overexpressed in wide range of cancers. Its inhibitors have been developed as
promising cancer therapy. We further discovered that PLK1 is involved in both regulation of EBV/KSHV latency
and survival of their cellular reservoirs in the host. Protein knockdown as well as chemical inhibition of PLK1
was able to reactivate latent EBV/KSHV and promote cell death of γ -herpesvirus-reactivated B lymphocytes.
These results expose a new viral mechanism that can describe how co-infection of γ -herpesviruses renders
HIV patients an increased risk to cancers, despite the fact that HIV itself is not oncogenic. Our investigations
into this topic will be accomplished by three separate aims that include: (1) Investigation of molecular
mechanism of PLK1 activation by HIV1 in EBV/KSHV-infected lymphocytes. (2) Investigation of how PLK1
regulates EBV/KSHV latency and maintenance of their cellular reservoirs. (3) Inhibition of PLK1 as novel
means to eradicate EBV/KSHV persistent infection by eliminating their cellular reservoirs.
Collectively, our proposed studies will contribute to the understanding of latency in HIV and
gammaherpesviruses infections that underlie various viral-associated cancers. This project will also help to
identify new molecular target for curing HIV and EBV/KSHV infections and their-related malignancies."
10839435,"After intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), phago(endo)cytosis of hematoma components [erythrocytes (RBC),
hemoglobin (Hb) and heme], by microglia/macrophages (MMΦ) is essential for removal/detoxification of the
hematoma, resolution of inflammation, and restoration of brain homeostasis for optimal neurological recovery.
Thus, strategies for protecting MMΦ from injury during engulfment of toxic hematoma components is critical for
the efficiency of MMΦ in clearing the hematoma after ICH.
Upon engulfment of RBC/Hb/heme from the hematoma, MMΦ express heme oxygenase 1 (HO1; encoded by
Hmox1), which catabolizes heme to produce large amounts of bilirubin (BrB) within MMΦ. Normally BrB is a
beneficial and potent antioxidant; however, when intracellular BrB accumulates to very high concentrations, it
may reversibly inhibit HO1 activity, thus reducing MMΦ' function and even precipitate onto biological membranes
or nucleic acids (due to its poor water solubility), causing injury and compromising MMΦ' integrity.
On the cellular level, BrB acts as an endogenous agonist for a pleotropic transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR), a protein that, based on prior research and our preliminary data, plays essential roles in
supporting MMΦ for their integrity and function during hematoma clearance to enhance brain recovery after ICH.
Our preliminary studies established that intracellularly elevated free BrB in microglia (MΦ), during
erythrophagocytosis, activates AhR to promote transcription of BrB handling proteins, ligandins
[(LGN/glutathione S-transferases), which bind fBrB to increase its cytosol solubility] and multidrug resistance
protein 1 [(Mrp1)14, 15, which mediates efflux of BrB from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular space].
Without fast clearance of intracellularly accumulating fBrB, MΦ are injured and function less efficiently, and
produce large amount of proinflammatory factors that could cause severe brain damage. In addition, we
established that BrB-activated AhR promotes phagocytosis and upregulates the expression of nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of cellular oxidative defense for hematoma detoxification,
and a potential therapeutic target for ICH. Furthermore, we established that AhR activity regulates RelB nuclear
translocation, suggesting that AhR may also interact with RelB to transactivate genes involving inflammation
resolution. Ultimately, using the mouse model of ICH, we found very promising therapeutic benefits of AhR
agonist ITE19-21, alone and even more so in combination with the activator of Nrf2 (sulforaphane, SF), regarding
neurological outcome and hematoma clearance.
Our hypothesis is that after ICH, activation of AhR/RelB in MMΦ during hematoma removal by BrB (or other
non-toxic AhR activators) is vital for preserving MMΦ' survival/phagocytic functions, avoiding self-inflicted
damage, retention of reparative phenotype, ultimately leading to a more efficient MMΦ-mediated hematoma
clearance and repair after ICH. Activation of AhR could be a novel therapeutic target for ICH."

In Uganda, HIV prevalence is estimated to be 6.2% among those aged 15-64, and is higher (6.9%) in Kampala,
the proposed study setting. Political and cultural barriers, including limited government funding and HIV stigma,
impede HIV prevention and have led to projections of rapid increases in HIV incidence. The proposed research
will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Game Changers, a 6-session peer-led group intervention that aims
to empower and mobilize people living with HIV (PLWH) to be agents for HIV prevention in their social networks.
By decreasing stigma among PLWH and their social network members, and training PLWH on strategies to
engage social network members in discussions around HIV, Game Changers provides PLWH with the tools to
do prevention advocacy. Game Changers was developed through an NIMH R34 that found high feasibility and
acceptability, and preliminary intervention effects on increased HIV prevention advocacy between PLWH and
their social network members, reduced internalized stigma, and increased HIV-serostatus disclosure to social
network members among PLWH, and medium to large effects on increased condom use and HIV testing among
a subsample of network members. The Specific Aims are: (1) To conduct an RCT of Game Changers, a peer-
led group intervention for PLWH in Uganda, to test intervention effects on the primary outcomes of reduced
condomless sex, increased HIV testing, and decreased enacted HIV stigma among social network members; (2)
To test intervention effects on the secondary outcomes of reduced internalized HIV stigma, increased HIV
serostatus disclosure, and increased viral load suppression among PLWH, and PrEP uptake among social
network members; (3) To examine whether increased HIV prevention advocacy by PLWH mediates intervention
effects on social network members’ increased condom use and HIV testing, and whether increased HIV
disclosure by PLWH mediates intervention effects on social network members’ reduced enacted HIV stigma;
and (4) To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention. We will recruit 210 PLWH, randomizing 105
to the intervention and 105 to an attention control. Each PLWH will be asked to recruit social network members
to complete assessments (736 total, 368/arm), to test intervention effects on social networks. All participants will
complete surveys at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-months post-baseline; PLWH will also complete social network
assessments. The cost-effectiveness analysis will inform policymakers about whether Game Changers is a
feasible intervention in which to invest. Our approach is particularly timely in the era of biomedical interventions,
which require widespread penetration of effective HIV prevention messaging into communities. Positioning
PLWH as central to the solution for controlling (vs. causing) the HIV epidemic has the potential to reduce HIV
stigma and improve prevention outcomes at the individual, household, and network levels."
10836347,"Project Summary
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is characterized by the aberrant osteochondral differentiation of tissue resident
mesenchymal progenitor cells. HO afflicts nearly 20% of extremity trauma, amputation and large surface area
burn patients and is clinically preceded by pain. Currently, no treatments exist to prevent initiation, reverse
disease progression, or limit pain through efficacious, non-opioid mechanisms. In the course of analyzing our
validated trauma-induced HO model, we observed nerve ingrowth as an early response to trauma. Using a
unique human traumatic HO dataset of early and late HO lesions, we have confirmed this early and maladaptive
nerve ingrowth precedes HO. Additionally, we discovered that surgical denervation potently inhibits early stages
of HO formation. In follow up studies, we uncovered the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) as the primary stimulus
of this pre-HO nerve ingrowth and, unexpectedly, that perivascular cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle
cells) appear to be the primary source of this neurotrophin. To elucidate the role of NGF induced nerve ingrowth
on HO, we performed complementary studies which suggest that nerve ingrowth may activate mesenchymal
progenitor cell TGFβ1 signaling to drive aberrant chondrogenic differentiation among local mesenchymal
progenitor HO precursor cells. These observations have led to our central hypothesis that perivascular derived
NGF stimulates TrkA-expressing sensory dendrite ingrowth into the HO site, which in turn releases TGFβ1 to
stimulate mesenchymal progenitor cell osteochondral differentiation. As such, the following aims are proposed:
Aim 1: Define the role of perivascular NGF in controlling sensory nerve ingrowth at sites of HO
initiation and progression. Using established animal models, we hypothesize that tissue-specific deletion of
Ngf in pericytes (Pdgfrb-CreERT2;Ngffl/fl) or vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs; Myh11-CreERT2;Ngffl/fl) will
abrogate peripheral nerve ingrowth and HO formation at sites of trauma.
Aim 2: Test the role of TGFβ1 signaling in sensory nerve-mesenchymal progenitor cell cross talk in
HO. Using established animal models, we hypothesize that sensory nerves positively regulate mesenchymal
progenitor cell osteochondral differentiation through a TGFβ1 dependent process.
Aim 3: Define a potential role for anti-NGF neutralizing antibodies as a novel HO therapeutic
intervention. We hypothesize that Fasinumab (an NGF neutralizing antibody) represents a dual analgesic and
negative regulator of HO disease progression, which blunts pathologic nerve ingrowth."

 Most of the 400,000 Americans living with an above-knee amputation [3] cannot walk at variable speeds and
safely negotiate environmental barriers with their prescribed prostheses [4]. This limited functional mobility
severely affects their independence and results in secondary health problems, such as back pain, osteoarthritis,
and depression [5]. Powered prostheses have the potential to address these problems by providing energy for
climbing on ramps or stairs or standing up from a seated position, and by improving walking stability and foot
clearance. However, available powered devices are designed to accommodate the needs of young, strong
people, who overwhelmingly lose their limb due to trauma and can already achieve full community ambulation
with available passive prostheses.
 The objective of this proposal is to identify key prosthesis technologies required to improve the mobility level
of above-knee amputees form limited (K2) to community (K3) ambulators. Our central hypothesis is that a
lightweight powered prosthesis can facilitate a transition into variable-speed ambulation and the negotiation of
environmental barriers (K3 level) for those amputee patients who currently function at the upper end of the K2
level. Our previous work has produced the first powered knee and ankle prosthesis [11]–[15] to combine the
lightness of a passive device (~5.5 lbs) with the power generation capability of a powered prosthesis (~400 W)
[16]–[18]. In addition, we have developed an innovative control framework that automatically synchronizes the
movement of the powered prosthesis joints with the movement of the residual leg, while modulating energy
injection based on walking speed [19]. These novel lightweight prosthesis technologies have been preliminary
validated with able-bodied subjects and young traumatic above-knee amputees (K3-K4 level) walking on level
[20] and inclined ground at variable speeds, and climbing up and down stairs [12]. Moreover, our preliminary
experiments with three K2 above-knee subjects demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding how lightweight robotic technologies contribute
to functional mobility will enable innovative design and prescription of prostheses that address the specific needs
of dysvascular and geriatric amputees, resulting in better healthcare, mobility, and quality of life.
 This contribution is significant because lightweight powered prostheses have the potential to extend longevity
and to dramatically improve quality of life for up to a million lower-limb amputees—a population expected to
double by 2050. Our approach is innovative because It leverages on a novel prosthesis technology that matches
the lightness of available passive prostheses without sacrificing power and torque generation capability to
address the specific needs of dysvascular patients for the first time. Cumulatively, this work is expected to provide
a comprehensive understanding of the engineering, biomechanical, and clinical factors that contribute to the
improvement of functional gait ability of amputee patients from limited to community ambulators."

The result of birth asphyxia is a huge burden on global health contributing to 1 million neonatal death each year.
The current recommendations by the neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) to provide external chest
compressions when a newborn’s heart rate remains below 60 beats per minute after providing effective external
breaths for 30 seconds. This protocol is based on expert opinion, but not evidence. The objective of this proposal
is to determine the heart rate range for starting external chest compression to optimize blood flow to the brain
and the heart. Low heart rate at birth in a newborn is normally due to impaired gas exchange, and our preliminary
studies show that performing external chest compressions (CC) could be harmful when the heart is still beating.
We hypothesize that continuing external breaths for low heart rate (<60 per minute), along with medications like
epinephrine and only initiating external cardiac compressions if there is a loss of pulse/heart rate. This approach
could improve gas exchange, leading to better cerebral and myocardial perfusion, reducing time to establish a
heart rate of ≥ 100 per minute, and decrease brain and heart injury. Our specific aims will help determine the
best heart rate cut-off (HR 60-40 or 40-20bpm) for initiating external compressions using both a preterm and
term lamb model by evaluating:
 1. Gas exchange and blood flows to brain and heart;
 2. The loss of intrinsic heart beat when external chest compressions are performed and time taken to
 achieve the desired heart rate;
 3. The role of CC on cerebral and cardiac injury.
We can measure coronary blood flow directly which has not been reported before, which will help establish
normal and abnormal blood flow to the heart during transition and the influence of performing external chest
compressions, which is a novel observation. The proposed research is significant to find out, if the current method
of providing neonatal resuscitation, which is not evidence based, could be improved. Using a combination of
hemodynamics, biomarkers and imaging techniques, these data could be translated to direct neonatal
resuscitation. Use of electrocardiogram in the delivery room to detect heart rate has increased the frequency of
providing chest compressions by 3-fold, and may be causing more damage if over used. It is also possible that
resuscitation in preterm bradycardia could require different treatment protocols than at term gestation. It is
important to understand the risk of brain and cardiac damage involved with the current practice. Focusing on
providing external breaths with chest compressions when needed, with the objective to limit cardiac and asphyxia
brain injury will have a great impact globally during resuscitation of 1.4 million newborns each year."

10814922,"ABSTRACT
A fundamental question in immunology lies in understanding how the immune system can mount robust T cell
responses to foreign pathogens, while restricting collateral damage to endogenous tissues, a state often
referred to as ""self vs. non-self discrimination"". Although many self-reactive conventional T (Tconv) cells are
removed from the body by clonal deletion, considerable evidence demonstrates that this process is imperfect.
The control of remaining self-reactive Tconv cells requires suppression by CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg)
cells, which function throughout life to prevent autoimmunity. Efforts to define the mechanisms by which Treg
cells suppress Tconv cells have revealed numerous potential mechanisms, including the masking of co-
stimulatory ligands, the local production of suppressive cytokines, or the hoarding of key accessory factors.
However, these antigen non-specific ""bystander"" mechanisms are not sufficient to explain self vs. non-self
discrimination, especially in the context of innate immune activation during infection, highlighting the
importance of new research examining the mechanisms of Treg-mediated suppression. Previously, we
identified two self-peptides (""C4"" and ""F1"" peptides) that are recognized by naturally occurring Treg cell
populations and are derived from a single prostate-specific protein, Tcaf3. Here, we demonstrate that selection
on the C4 peptide during repertoire formation is critical for the prevention of prostatitis, and that polyclonal Treg
cells of other specificities can not compensate for the shift in the C4-specific T cell pool. This reveals a key role
for Treg-mediated suppression of Tconv cells of matched peptide/MHC-II (pMHC-II) specificity, as opposed to
broad antigen non-specific mechanisms. The objectives of this application are to elucidate mechanisms by
which Treg cells coordinate pMHC-II-specific immune suppression at steady state and during infection. We will
achieve our objectives in close collaboration with Dr. Ron Germain, an expert in advanced imaging techniques,
and Dr. Nancy Freitag, an expert in the genetics of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). In Aim 1, we
will use functional experiments and advanced confocal imaging to define the mechanistic basis of pMHC-II-
specific Treg cell suppression at steady state, testing the hypothesis Treg cells do not prevent the initial
activation of pMHC-II-matched Tconv cells, but instead rheostatically respond to activated Tconv cells to
restrict their subsequent differentiation and expansion. In Aim 2, we will define the role of Treg cell pMHC-II
specificity in coordinating self vs. non-self discrimination during Lm infection, testing the hypothesis that robust
pMHC-II-specific suppression by self-selected Treg cells is imparted by both quantitative (numerical)
advantages and qualitative properties induced by the recognition of peripheral self-ligand prior to infection. In
all, our work is expected to elucidate key mechanisms by which the immune system orchestrates host defense
while limiting collateral damage to self tissues."
10817098,"Abstract: The enduring goal of this T32 application is to support the continued training of surgical
residents to become consequential physician-scientists in Health Services and Translational
Research. In our well-funded laboratories, the translational research training of surgical scientists will
focus on the fields of trauma, burn, wound healing, and regenerative medicine while the health
services research training will be targeted in the critical discipline of clinical outcomes investigation in
order to educate surgeons and to promote evidenced-based medicine. The former emphasizes
translating scientific discoveries from the research bench to the patient’s bedside, whereas the latter
centers on determining the efficacy of therapeutic interventions to improve clinical outcomes. The
purpose of the health services research portion of the training grant is for young surgeons to integrate
clinical experience with training in program development and research methods. The purpose of the
translational scientific portion of the training grant is to provide formal instruction on laboratory
research project design and sound research methods of hypothesis-driven investigation to push the
boundaries of surgical innovation. The curriculum is designed to encourage the participants of the
program to become future academic surgical investigators who will apply this training to find solutions
to the many challenges posed by the U.S. healthcare system. The program will foster a cadre of well-
prepared surgical scientist trainees to ease their transition into academics. Future academic surgical
investigators will benefit from greater knowledge in both important areas as they will be in the unique
position to initiate research that bridges clinical and basic experimentation while also evaluating the
effectiveness of their treatments. Our past trainees have successfully launched careers in academics
and received PhDs using our T-32 grant training as a career defining experience. This newly
structured organization that was initiated as an innovative iteration of this training grant in our last
grant cycle has demonstrated great success over the past 5 years. Building upon the distinguished
achievements of the longstanding history of our T-32 training program at this institution, this novel
programmatic adaptation is particularly well suited toward training the academic surgeons of the 21st
century."
10839992,"Abstract:
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is thought to be caused by a combination of multiple genetic and environmental
factors, and the role of infectious agents has been debated for decades. A recent multi-omic, epidemiological
study of large Alzheimer patient cohorts revealed a specific and significant association of human herpesvirus
6A (HHV6A) with AD. However, these studies could not resolve which HHV6A specific genes were involved or
how HHV6A might affect cells of the central nervous system (CNS) to exacerbate AD. As HHV6A is mainly
present in the brain in its latent form, we asked the question of whether the major latency associated gene
U94A, affects host cells functions that are relevant to Alzheimer disease pathology.
Using a human cell system, we found that U94A expression impairs the migration and maturation of human
glial progenitor cells (OPCs) and leads to synapse loss in human neurons. Preliminary transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis of U94A infected cells showed dysregulation of genes involved in cytoskeletal functions and
synaptic maturation. In addition, we found that expression of U94A increases accumulation of Aβ and
phosphorylation of Tau in cells co-expressing a familial Alzheimer disease (FAD)-linked, mutant APPswe
variant. These phenotypes are particularly relevant for the early stages of Alzheimer disease, as mounting
evidence suggests that synapse and neurite loss, associated with diffuse demyelination precede cognitive
impairment. Based on our published and preliminary data, we propose that the latency gene U94A represents
a disease-modifying factor that renders neural cells vulnerable to Alzheimer disease associated risk factors,
and exacerbates Alzheimer’s pathology in vitro and in vivo. We propose three Aims in which we test the
hypotheses that (i) U94A expression exacerbates Aβ accumulation in iPSC derived neural cells from familial
Alzheimer disease (FAD) patients and will exacerbate neuronal and glial cell impairments, (ii) that U94A
expression in the context of FAD mutations in mice will exacerbate cellular pathologies in vivo and (iii) that the
cellular impairments caused by U94A are sufficient to exacerbate cognitive deficits in familial Alzheimer’s
mouse models. This work will provide insight into the potential role of infectious agents in Alzheimer’s
pathology and will establish that HHV6A viral latency is not merely a benign state of viral infection, but an
important disease modifying factor."
10851761,"The three components of the peripheral autonomic nervous system, the parasympathetic, sympathetic and
sensory nerves, work together to prevent life-threatening fluctuations in glucose homeostasis. They do so in
part by regulating hormone secretion from the pancreatic islet. Stimulating autonomic nerves with electrodes
has recently been recognized as a potential way to treat diseases (neuromodulation). Given its central role in
glucose metabolism and diabetes, the pancreatic islet is considered a primary target for neuromodulation. To
propose electrical stimulation of nerves to treat diabetes, however, it is essential to understand how islet
nerves impact insulin secretion from the beta cell. The objective of this application is to determine the
mechanisms nerves use to control hormone secretion from the pancreas. Recent anatomical studies show in
detail how autonomic nerves innervate the islet, but how exactly autonomic nerves impact hormone secretion
from the islet is not known. We hypothesize that parasympathetic, enteric, and sensory neural pathways act
through intrapancreatic ganglia to modulate local cholinergic control of islet cell function. The rationale for the
proposed research is that there is a need to understand the local mechanisms of autonomic nerve control of
hormone secretion from the islet, which is relevant to the mission of the NIH. Guided by preliminary data, our
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) the role of pancreas sensory innervation in
regulating islet function, and (2) the role of the intrapancreatic ganglion as a signaling hub controlling islet
function. Under the first aim, we will test that the vagal sensory innervation of the islet participates in a
vagovagal neuronal circuit regulating islet hormone secretion. We will selectively stimulate islet cells with a
chemogenetic approach and gain genetic access to activated neurons with the Targeted Recombination in
Active Populations (TRAP) system. We will combine TRAP with tools for labeling, tracing, recording, and
manipulating neurons in the brainstem activated by islet cell stimulation. Under the second aim, we will test
that intrapancreatic ganglia integrate signals from parasympathetic efferent nerves, enteric neurons, and
sensory axons to compute an executive summary of gut and brain inputs to adjust the local cholinergic control
they exert on islet cells. We will stimulate parasympathetic, enteric and sensory innervation of the ganglion ex
vivo and in vivo with chemogenetic and optogenetic tools and measure the effects in intrapancreatic neurons.
We will further study how manipulating intrapancreatic neuronal activity affects islet function and glucose
metabolism (insulin plasma levels and glycemia). We expect that applying our novel approaches to measure
and manipulate pancreas nerve activity will yield important information about how nerves affect islet biology.
This contribution is significant because it will provide fundamental knowledge that will complete and revise
models about the influence of autonomic nerves on endocrine pancreas function. Once a functional map of
islet innervation is available, we will be able to propose neuromodulation to improve islet function in diabetes."

10876293,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE)
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSRACT
The overall goal of the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center's (UCDCCC) Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) efforts is to catalyze, conduct, and lead outreach and engagement for the entire spectrum
of cancer research (basic, clinical, translational, and population sciences) that will reduce the cancer burden
across the lifespan in the UCDCCC's catchment area and beyond. The Aims that contribute to the fulfillment of
this goal include characterizing the cancer burden in the catchment area (Aim 1); mobilizing Cancer Center
research to address cancer disparities and the cancer burden in the catchment area (Aim 2); and deploying
COE-based assets and policy initiatives to mitigate the cancer burden (Aim 3). The catchment area is
comprised of 19 inland northern California counties (23,800 square miles) and is home to 5 million residents,
the majority of whom (57%) are racial/ethnic minorities with higher proportions of every racial/ethnic population
in the catchment area except African Americans. The leading causes of cancer incidence and mortality in the
catchment area are similar to the U.S., but when stratified by race/ethnicity, there are notable differences. Led
by the CCSG PI and the Associate Director for Population Sciences and Community Outreach/Engagement,
the COE is guided by a highly interactive Community Advisory Board and UCD Faculty Expert Panel. COE
activities are implemented by a robust infrastructure of COE faculty leaders and staff. The scope of COE
activities ranges from population-specific cancer prevention and control efforts; special emphasis on tobacco
control; support for the inclusion of minorities in clinical trials throughout the lifespan; and catalyzing policy
change. COE accomplishments include the extensive characterization of the cancer burden through both
primary data (mailed, in-person and online) and multiple secondary data sources (Aim 1); harnessing COE-
CCSG research program collaborations to address the cancer burden through research (Aim 2); and
intervening to decrease tobacco use, increase HPV vaccination rates, eliminate perinatal HBV transmission
and to increase cancer awareness and screening. Of note, the Cancer Center/COE convened a local
educational roundtable that contributed to the statewide ban on the sale of flavored tobacco. The Cancer
Center has also contributed to updated US Preventive Services Task Force cancer screening guidelines for
breast, cervical and prostate cancer. The Logic Model used to evaluate COE reflects the trajectory of current
progress that would lead to outcomes for the next cycle and beyond, reflecting the aspiration to be a national
model for mitigating the cancer burden in a heterogeneous catchment area population."
10872110,"Project Summary
The case for robust support for biomedical research training has never been stronger. During the last two
years, the nation’s translational research enterprise was stress tested by a pandemic, revealing both stunning
strengths and startling weaknesses. While the precise nature of future biomedical and public health challenges
cannot be known, it is clear that the safety and welfare of the country depends on a robust pipeline of scientists
with diverse expertise, who are well trained in core competencies across the full spectrum of clinical and
translational science (CTS). It is increasingly recognized that training researchers outside of their narrow field
of scientific specialization, to include a more varied set of research and professional skills—particularly those
related to later translational phases—is critical to deliver on the promise to transform human health and
respond to new challenges. These areas have long been signature strengths of the Tufts Clinical and
Translational Science (CTS) Graduate Program, the training core of Tufts Clinical and Translational Science
Institute (CTSI). Our MS/PhD program was founded in 1999 as the nation’s first clinical research program
based at a school of graduate biomedical sciences and an academic medical center and we have continuously
evolved to meet the changing needs of CTS training. Our success is evidenced by the productivity of our
trainees, the consistently high rate of retention of graduates in research careers, and our outstanding history of
training leaders in clinical research. The two principal aims of this proposal include the following:
AIM 1: Train the next generation of early career researchers in critical thinking skills and rigorous
methodology to meet the translational science challenges of the coming decades. We will provide
rigorous training in the core knowledge expectations of CTS to clinical and biomedical research fellows with
diverse interests by leveraging our new and longstanding partnerships; by building and expanding upon the
history of excellence in CTS training in our MS/PhD Graduate Program; by enhancing three specialized T32
Tracks, including Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness Research (PACER); One Health; and
Health Policy and Health Disparities (HPHD).
AIM 2: Prepare early career researchers to be effective leaders, team members, communicators, and
innovators in translational science. We will enrich the individualized mentoring and research experiences of
the T32 trainees by leveraging the infrastructure of Tufts CTSI and partner institutions to provide supplemental
training in stakeholder and community engagement, science communication, team science, professional
development and leadership, rigor and transparency, and critical review of research; and by curating and
capitalizing on experiential opportunities within the Tufts CTSI and partner institutions, with an emphasis on
data science and informatics, clinical trial innovation and best practices, and entrepreneurship and innovation."
10873683,"Project Summary
We propose to substantially expand opportunities at the Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences for
predoctoral training in clinical and translational science (CTS). Based on our recent experience integrating
predoctoral students in our established postdoctoral program, we have found that early exposure to CTS
training can profoundly influence the career trajectories of scholars and enrich the learning environment for all
levels of trainees. The Tufts CTS Graduate Program, the training core of Tufts Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI), has a long and distinguished history in training leaders in clinical research and CTS.
Founded in 1999 as the nation's first clinical research program based at a school of graduate biomedical
sciences and an academic medical center, we have continuously evolved to meet the changing needs of CTS
training. Now we seek to build on our successful experience to increase our impact preparing the CTS
workforce by preparing predoctoral trainees to meet future healthcare challenges. As the world emerges from
the COVID-19 pandemic, the case for engaging trainees in CTS research earlier in their careers has never
been stronger. While we cannot fully anticipate the specific healthcare challenges that predoctoral trainees will
face in the coming decades, we can discern emerging themes that will undoubtedly dominate. For example, it
seems certain that future healthcare solutions will increasingly rely on real world evidence emerging from the
convergence of machine learning and routinely collected big data. Also, it is abundantly clear from the COVID-
19 pandemic that interactions between humans, animals, and the environment will be a critical, perhaps
existential determinant of our health and survival. Finally, while the wealthy appear to be reaching our natural
lifespans, durable socioeconomic disparities are estimated to account for roughly one in three premature
deaths even in highly developed countries; substantial health gains undoubtedly depend on addressing social
determinants of health and other causes of disparity. These concerns, aligned with Tufts' strengths, have
shaped our three specialized T32 Program Tracks: Predictive Analytics and Comparative Effectiveness
Research (PACER), One Health, and Health Policy and Health Disparities (HPHD). Thus, responding to the
call of NCATS to train more predoctoral scholars, we have two principal aims: AIM 1: Inspire and prepare
promising professional students as Medical Research Scholars to devote their careers to clinical and
translational science. We will provide pathways for professional students (e.g., MD, DVM, DMD, DPT) to
augment their clinical education with Certificate, MS, or PhD-level training in CTS. AIM 2: Prepare PhD
candidates as Translational Research Scholars to embark on future careers as clinical and
translational scientists. We will recruit and train candidates with prior biomedical backgrounds into our CTS
PhD program; and provide pathways for doctoral students in related fields (e.g., basic science, computer
science, nutrition) to augment their research training with Certificate or MS-level training in CTS."
10916174,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each year, approximately one-third of all hospitalized patients in the US (corresponding to about 12 million
Americans) receive unfractionated heparin (UFH) to prevent clotting during surgical and invasive medical
procedures, such as open-heart surgery and transcatheter heart valve replacement, and to prevent postoperative
clotting issues, such as deep vein thrombosis, and major ischemic events, such as pulmonary embolism, heart
attack, and stroke. UFH is a fast-acting, reversible, and inexpensive anticoagulant drug that indirectly inhibits
several clotting factors, including thrombin and Xa. However, UFH is associated with serious acute side effects,
including hypersensitivity reactions. The non-linear dose response to UFH and a high degree of patient-to-patient
and batch-to-batch variability lead to medication errors related to improper dosing, and these errors are among
the most common and serious in clinical practice. An estimated 1-5% of patients who receive UFH experience
an immune response known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is considered life threatening or
results in death in 20-30% of affected patients. Additionally, up to 26% of cardiac surgery patients experience
“heparin resistance,” where achieving therapeutic anticoagulation requires excessive doses of UFH. As with any
anticoagulant, treatment with UFH carries the risk of excessive bleeding, which can be fatal. UFH is reversed by
protamine, which is also associated with serious side effects, including anaphylaxis and toxicity. Accurate
determination of the dosing ratio of protamine to UFH is challenging, putting patients at risk for protamine
overdose. In the context of medical procedures that require precise (i.e., immediate and titratable) hemostatic
control, such as transcatheter heart valve replacement, these shortcomings are particularly challenging. Thus,
there is a recognized, unmet medical need for new anticoagulant/reversal agent combinations that are safe and
fast acting with a predictable dose response to enable more precise hemostatic control during medical
procedures. Helixomer, Inc. is developing a novel polynucleotide-based anticoagulant/antidote combination for
intravenous anticoagulation. In vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that Helixomer’s anticoagulant drug,
Hex01, and its antidote, Hex02, are highly specific and fast acting, with clear, predictable dose responses. Hex01
specifically binds to and directly inhibits thrombin, the enzyme responsible for fibrin deposition and clot formation.
Hex02 base-pairs with and deactivates Hex01, reversing the anticoagulant effect by releasing thrombin. In this
Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, Helixomer will advance the preclinical development of Hex01 and Hex02 by i)
validating bioanalytical assays for Hex01 and Hex02 in plasma to support preclinical development, ii) establishing
scale-up manufacturing methods for Hex01, iii) determining a dosing strategy for Hex01 and Hex02 in a porcine
large-animal model, and iv) defining safety and toxicity profiles for Hex01 and Hex02 and identifying the
maximum tolerated dose through non-GLP dose range finding studies in rats and dogs. Successful completion
of these critical preclinical studies will support subsequent pivotal GLP toxicology studies and IND submission."
10799605,"Project Summary
Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in resource-poor areas. In order to colonize the
intestine and cause disease, successful bacterial pathogens must sense and respond to intestinal signals by
altering both metabolism and virulence factor expression. We hypothesize that by understanding the critical
intestinal signals and the bacterial regulatory networks they activate, we can devise simple dietary alterations
that prevent or mitigate morbidity and mortality.
We focus on Vibrio cholerae, the agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera. Because the metabolic
pathways we study are highly conserved, these findings also serve as a paradigm for other bacteria that cause
diarrhea. The goal of this work is to elucidate the complex and highly conserved regulatory network that is
activated when V. cholerae enters the intestinal environment.
In the first 4-year funding period of this grant, we explored the role of a global regulator of metabolism and
virulence known as glucose-specific Enzyme llA. We showed that this regulator is membrane-associated
through an N-terminal amphipathic helix and that membrane association is critical for its interaction with
integral membrane protein partners that it regulates. Based on this work, we hypothesize that the inner
membrane of the bacterial cell may act as a platform for regulatory proteins that sense and respond to
nutritional signals in the intestinal environment.
During the previous funding period, we discovered that the subcellular location of the global transcription
factor, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), is regulated in response to environmental conditions. In the current
funding period, we propose to follow up on these observations by investigating regulation of CRP subcellular
localization, the mechanism by which subcellular localization alters CRP activation of gene transcription, and
the functional significance of CRP subcellular localization for V. cholerae virulence. We hypothesize that if the
subcellular localization of CRP can be controlled via host diet, it may be possible to reduce pathogen virulence
and thereby the morbidity and mortality caused by cholera."

Of 46 million people worldwide with active epilepsy, one third are drug-resistant. Emerging neuromodulation-
based therapies have demonstrated great potential to reduce seizure frequency and improve the quality of life
in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy over time. The mechanisms underlying such therapies are thought to
relate to the progressive restructuring of the epileptogenic network toward dynamics that reduce epileptic
activity. Yet, the network properties underlying low and high epileptic potential are poorly understood, and the
management of neuromodulatory therapies thus remains largely empiric with variable outcomes. To move
toward rational approaches rooted in mechanistic understanding, there is a critical need to first fundamentally
understand how network dynamics influence epileptogenic activity. In this proposal, we turn to the rich
relationship between sleep and epilepsy, as sleep-wake states offer a robust and systematic way to cycle
through a wide range of network dynamics that are strongly associated with different epileptic potentials. By
leveraging sleep-wake states as a portal to probing dynamic brain networks, the overall objective of this
proposal is to identify salient network features that represent states of variable epileptogenic potential and to
determine associated network mechanisms that indicate reconfiguration into epileptogenic states. Using a
combination of magnetoencephalography (MEG) imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)/tractography, I will
first identify physiologic network dynamics of sleep-wake states in patients with focal epilepsy (Aim 1). I will
then identify state-dependent network predictors and develop biophysical models of pathologic states
predictive of interictal epileptiform activity (Aim 2). The expected outcome of this work is to gain a deeper
understanding of key network features that augment epileptic potential and insight into their underlying
mechanisms. This proposal combines an innovative research project with translational implications and a
rigorous training and career development plan, which are highly complementary and together will facilitate my
transition into an independent physician-scientist. I have assembled a leading, multidisciplinary mentorship
team that has a constellation of expertise aligned with my research and training goals, including in epilepsy,
sleep, MEG imaging, structural-function network analysis, neural computation, and biostatistics. In addition,
through formal training, coursework, and directed mentorship, I will advance my skills in the areas of signal
processing, machine learning, dynamical models, sleep electrophysiology, and clinical trials, which I will
continue to use throughout my scientific career. The knowledge and training obtained during this award period
will enable me to establish a robust independent research program that leverages multimodal
electrophysiology and imaging in humans and insights from the rich relationship between sleep and epilepsy to
improve therapeutic tools for patients with medically refractory epilepsy."
10756543,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 out of 10 women worldwide. While PCOS is
primarily characterized by menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenemia, it is also associated
with multiple comorbidities – including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and
infertility – that lead to substantial morbidity and health care costs. A complex interaction
between adiposity, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased androgen concentrations
underlies the pathophysiology of PCOS. These signs often first appear in early adolescence,
representing a key opportunity for preventive interventions. While physical activity is a promising
strategy for targeting the factors underlying PCOS development, there is a significant literature
gap regarding effective strategies for use in PCOS prevention. The goal of this proposal is to
identify the time course of changes in insulin dynamics and androgen concentrations in females
from mid-childhood through adolescence and the impact of physical activity during early
adolescence on these endpoints (Aim 1) and use implementation science methods to refine
(Aim 2) and pilot a targeted and evidence-based physical activity intervention in peripubertal
girls ages 8-10 at risk for PCOS while assessing the interventions’ feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary efficacy in relation to physical activity levels, insulin sensitivity, and androgen
concentrations (Aim 3). The findings from this study will inform the development, dissemination,
and implementation of effective and scalable preventive interventions, a high priority area for the
NIDDK. Additionally, by specifically targeting young females at risk for later metabolic disease,
this proposal takes a life-course approach to chronic disease prevention. The PI, Dr. Whooten,
is an early career clinician investigator and pediatric endocrinologist, as well as health services
researcher. She will use this career development award to build her skills in (1) the longitudinal
analysis of epidemiological cohorts, (2) design and implementation of behavioral interventions
informed by an implementation science approach, and (3) collection and measurement of
objective behavioral and physiologic outcomes which will be essential for evaluating intervention
efficacy. Dr. Whooten will work closely with a multidisciplinary mentorship and advisory team
with expertise in epidemiology, objective measurement of health behaviors, measurement of
endocrine physiologic outcomes, implementation science, and biostatistics to carry out her
stated career objectives and specific aims."

Candidate: This resubmission for the NCI K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career
Development Award to Promote Diversity describes Efrén J. Flores, MD as a candidate who is well-
positioned to successfully complete the proposed training objectives and research aims. Dr. Flores’
background as a Hispanic physician and clinical researcher has focused on achieving equity in lung
cancer outcomes through early detection by developing novel interventions to increase LCS uptake
among Hispanic and othervulnerable populations. Background: Lung cancer remains the leading
cause of cancer-specific mortality in theUS, and Hispanics experience worse lung cancer outcomes
and die at higher rates due to advanced stage at presentation. Lung cancer screening (LCS) can
save many lives through early lung cancer detection among Hispanic current and former smokers.
Still, without increasing efforts to improve smoking status disclosure and documentation and tailored
interventions to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers, this underserved
population will continue to demonstrate disparities in lung cancer survival. Study aims: Based on prior
research experience, Dr. Flores has adapted the NIMHD research framework by incorporating
elements from Ford’s evidence-based theoretical model to guide the following proposed study aims:
1) To elucidate barriers and facilitators to consistent identification and documentation of smoking
status to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former smokers; 2) To assess feasibility,
acceptability, and reach of the digital delivery of an educational video to promote LCS uptake among
Hispanic current and former smokers; 3) To explore the effect of the digital delivery of the educational
video to increase interest, intent, and scheduling of LCS uptake among Hispanic current and former
smokers. Training: The career development plan will allow Dr. Flores to develop expertise in tailoring
LCS interventions among Hispanic communities by completing training objectives in three areas: 1)
mixed methods to inform health interventions; 2) community-based participatory research to guide
outreach interventions; 3) digital interventions tailored to promote LCS uptake among Hispanic
communities. Advanced coursework, a resource-rich institutional environment, and the proposed
research study will support these training objectives. Mentorship: A team of expert mentors,
including Dr. Elyse R. Park (primary mentor),Dr. Ruth C. Carlos (co-mentor), and Dr. Kelly E Irwin
(co-mentor), and scientific advisors including Dr. Jennifer Haas, Dr. Nancy Rigotti, Dr. Giselle Perez,
Dr. Jo-Anne Shepard, Dr. Joseph Betancourt, and Dr. Nathaniel Mercaldo will guide Dr. Flores’
training and research efforts for the duration of the award. Impact: The successfulcompletion of this
proposed K08 award will provide Dr. Flores with the rigorous training and research expertise that will
provide high-quality data to inform an NCI R01. It will also serve as a foundation for him to become
a leading independent investigator developing novel interventions to overcome disparities and
advance equity in lung cancer outcomes among Hispanics and other vulnerable populations."

The Neuroscience Colorado Research Experience (N-CORE) is a summer internship and educational
program that gives undergraduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds (URM) authentic
neuroscience research experiences in state-of-the-art biomedical research labs at the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical School Campus (CU Anschutz). N-CORE's overarching goal is to cultivate a better
understanding of neuroscience and biomedical research, engender scientific enthusiasm, and promote
retention in scientific fields. N-CORE accomplishes this through a summer program that combines high-
quality mentored research experiences, educational programming, professional development opportunities,
and longitudinal mentoring. N-CORE interns receive instruction on core neuroscience concepts, scientific
rigor and reproducibility, scientific communication, and professional development. At the end of the summer
internship, all interns present their research at a campus-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Emphasis will be placed on ensuring an inclusive environment that fosters diversity in education and research
and all Program faculty mentors will receive training in mentoring diverse students. After the internship, intern
alumni are automatically enrolled in our Pre-doctoral Mentorship Program, where they will receive customized
guidance on profession development and career opportunities. N-CORE brings together the expertise,
enthusiasm, and institutional support to succeed in its goals. The N-CORE Program Directors bring over a
decade of experience in managing a summer research program for URM undergraduate students and have
built a strong alliance with the CU Anschutz Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP), an NIH-supported T32
training program. Critically, N-CORE also brings on-board NGP graduate and MD/PhD students in the
leadership and operations of N-CORE. These students will help interns quickly integrate into the CU
Anschutz research community. In this proposal, we seek to build on our collective past successes and
expertise to create a well-supported, sustainable summer research experience program for URM
undergraduate students that will foster a better understanding of neuroscientific biomedical and clinical
research and build a community for like-minded individuals interested in continuing along a scientific or
medical career path."
10813086,"Protein synthesis governs if, how fast, and how many times cells divide. Yet how protein synthesis is
linked molecularly with cell division is unknown. We will use budding yeast as a model system to answer
this problem because yeast has unique properties suited for genetic and biochemical studies. In the
previous period, we identified transcripts that engage with the protein synthesis machinery, the
ribosomes, in the process of translation in synchronously dividing cells that maintained the physiological
coupling of protein synthesis with their division. We will leverage these findings to tackle the long-
standing problem of protein synthesis requirements for cell division. In Aim 1, we will identify how
translational control of lipogenesis impinges on nuclear morphology. We propose experiments to test the
idea that translational control of lipid synthesis, together with lipid-transfer proteins, impact specific parts
of lipid metabolism, to control the morphology of the nucleus in the cell cycle. We will also measure the
changing levels of lipids in the nucleus during cell division. In Aim 2, we will determine how outputs of
one-carbon metabolic pathways change in the cell cycle and respond to translational control. Our data
point to the critical roles of enzymes that are part of the folate-based, one-carbon metabolism. We will
identify how protein synthesis controls the expression of enzymes of one-carbon metabolism. We will
also measure how the different metabolite inputs and outputs of one-carbon metabolic pathways are
allocated at distinct points in the cell cycle. Overall, the research we propose will reveal fundamental
links between cell growth, protein synthesis, and cell division, enabling novel therapeutic interventions in
proliferative diseases."
10885928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Radiolabeled peptides are emerging as a very valuable class of radiotracers that are seated in a unique chemical
space, exploiting many of the advantages of small molecules and large biomolecules. To date, they have mostly
been used in the oncology field for imaging and treatment. Important to note that peptides are widely sought in
drug development for the same reasons. This mass appeal is mostly in part to the high density of chirality and
functionality that peptides possess as well as their ease of synthesis which has significantly benefited from
automation. In addition, several technologies exist, like one-bead-one-compound libraries and phage display
approaches that render discovering biologically-relevant, target-specific peptides quite easy. A new twist on
some very old chemistry has paved the way for a new technology in the radiolabeling of peptides that yields high
purity, high molar activity tracers in biologically compatible formulation without need for costly reconstitution and
purification steps, and can potentially be fully integrated into existing automated peptide synthesis.
A technology like this would tremendously benefit the synthesis, evaluation and clinical translation of peptide
radiotracers. Beyond this, however, this technology offers new opportunities to integrate positron emission
labeled molecules in drug discovery and pharmacology. A robust and automated platform to radiolabel a richly
diverse class of molecules could be used to assess collections of molecules in single molecular interactions, in
cells and in living biological systems.
The goal of this proposal is the development of a new radiolabeling technical platform for peptides and apply it
to a group of phage-selected antimicrobial peptides. The study of this group of labeled compounds will be
conducted in parallel to assist in the discovery of new biologically-relevant, target-specific peptides, as well as,
gaining fundamental understanding of the structure and function relationships of groups of peptides. The
information gathered from this project will play in important role in the development of new imaging agents and
therapies."

Due to their clinical and research training and expertise, physician-scientists are poised to provide new unique
insights into disease, ultimately leading to advances in treatments. However, there has been a long-recognized
shortage of physician-investigators. While combined MD-PhD programs have helped address this shortage,
there are substantially more physicians without PhD degrees graduating from medical schools who form a
substantial pool of potential investigators to overcome this shortage. Physician-scientists are especially needed
to explore infectious diseases and immune-related diseases to derive new therapeutic advances. Here, the
applicant and his team propose to meet this challenge by focusing on non-PhD physicians with a new R38
Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) Program in Infectious Disease and Immunology
research (ID/IMM StARR) at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). The ID/IMM StARR Program
is designed to provide protected time for mentored research, didactic training, and career development that will
allow residents to fulfill board requirements and take advantage of the robust environment at WUSM for
physician-scientist training and in ID/IMM research. The Specific Aims are to:
Aim 1: Provide Dermatology, Medicine, Neurology, Pathology and Pediatric residents high quality, competency
 based, rigorous training in basic or clinical/translational ID/IMM research
Aim 2: Provide 1-2 years of mentored research training, didactic training and other scientific enrichment
 activities, and Individual Development Plans for career development to ensure the success of residents
 in the StARR Program through close interaction with outstanding scientific mentors, career advisory
 committees and program directors
Aim 3: Expand the number and diversity of well-trained residents ultimately performing research, and pursuing
 subspecialty fellowships to become independent research faculty in infectious disease and immunology
Aim 4: Perform robust evaluation and tracking to demonstrate the impact of the StARR Program
Thus, R38 residents will be well-prepared for an ultimate career as independent investigators in ID/IMM
research."

 Our objective is to develop a multi-stage microscale cyclone technology that will serve as an efficient and scalable
platform for bioaerosol fractionation, enabling more effective studies of fundamental and applied viral aerobiology. The
microcyclones will be designed to isolate selected aerosol size fractions collected from exhaled breath samples,
enabling the distribution of respiratory virus within these samples to be evaluated with high size resolution. Significantly,
the technology will be designed to overcome the limitations of existing aerobiological instruments by enhancing the
dynamic size range, maximum number of collected fractions, resolution, throughput, and bioefficiency. The platform
will take advantage of a high resolution stereolithography-based 3d printing technique to pattern large arrays of
complex microcyclone structures in a monolithic substrate, with multiple arrays placed in series to allow selected
aerosol size ranges to be isolated from the sample flow. The system will further support the integration of a hydrogel
layer within each microcyclone array to allow the capture of live virus for infectivity studies. The microcyclone arrays
will be combined with an established exhaled breath collection system and employed to study the distribution of
influenza virus from infected subjects. To support these goals, individual microcyclone elements will be designed,
fabricated, characterized, and optimized for isolating at least five distinct aerosol size fractions ranging from 200 nm to
10 µm, followed by the development of full microcyclone arrays integrating hundreds of individual separation elements
in a single device. A set of cascaded arrays will be assembled into a reusable cartridge to enable collection of all target
fractions within a single integrated unit, and the resulting cartridge will be interfaced with the existing system for high-
volume exhaled breath collection (the G-II sampler developed in the Milton laboratory). The integrated instrument will
be used to collect exhaled breath samples from at least 15 individuals with active influenza infection for the evaluation
of virus distribution across all size fractions. The study results are expected to validate the technology as a powerful
tool for enhancing our understanding of aerobiology and improving modeling, risk analysis, and mitigation strategies
for a wide range of airborne diseases. Successful completion of these aims will offer a clear view of the potential of the
microcyclone array technology for collection and high resolution fractionation of bioaerosols from exhaled breath
samples. For future steps we envision optimizing bioefficiency of the technology to support culture of collected virus,
scaling the arrays to support environmental sampling at higher flow rates, and extending application of the technology
to the characterization of aerosolized bacteria and fungal spores."
10746134,"Many of major autoimmune diseases are sexually dimorphic. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),
scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, Sjogren’s syndrome, and some forms of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) are primarily
occurring in females. It has been attributed to multiple factors including expression of the genes encoded by
sex chromosomes, hormonal regulation of gene expression, and lately to unexpected regulation by commensal
microbiota. Thus, understanding of sexual dimorphism of diseases requires that the problem be approached by
a combination of different strategies. In this proposal, we take advantage of our abilities to perform state of the
art experiments using genetically modified and gnotobiotic animals with original and constantly developing
computational methods. Our preliminary data demonstrates the efficiency of such an integrative approach to
the problem. We have suggested a ‘dual signal’ model of autoimmunity involving regulation by microbes and
sex hormones. Accordingly, hormonal and microbial influences do not have to be simultaneous: they may be
important at different stages of development or disease progression. We are focusing on T cell-intrinsic and T-
cell-extrinsic effects of Androgen Receptor (AR) and the mechanisms of microbiota’s effect on T1D
development. Given the complexity of the problem, we plan to pursue several carefully selected goals that will
continue to lay foundation for the future expansion of research in this important area.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the input of T cell-intrinsic and T cell-extrinsic mechanisms in the sexual
dimorphism of T1D.
1.1. Determine whether all cells involved in AR-mediated protection from T1D are of bone marrow origin;
1.2. Define the role of myeloid cells in male protection from T1D;
1.3. Test the contribution of myeloid cells in T cell transfer experiments;
1.4. Test a role that transcription factor AIRE plays in sexual dimorphism of T1D.
Specific Aim 2. Investigate the influence of AR signaling on T cell selection and function
2.1. Determine the influence of AR on the TCR repertoires;
2.2. Determine how the properties of the TCR affect the influence of AR on repertoire selection;
2.3. Study the role of AR in regulation of interferon gamma (IFNg) related to autoimmunity;
2.4. Study the role of AR in regulation of the IFNg locus;
Specific Aim 3. Determine where and when the microbiota amplifies AR effects on T1D development.
3.1. Test T1D development in GF animals with conditional AR deficiencies;
3.2. Determine whether microbes contribute to changes in immune cells properties during their development;
3.3. Establish the timeline to imprinting males to become resistant to T1D by the microbiota;
3.4. Determine which immune-related pathways are affected by the microbiota."

Presentations of respiratory failure can vary from mild requiring supplemental oxygen to more severe
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS). Early in
respiratory failure patients often have abnormalities in gas exchange, control of breathing, and/or pulmonary
mechanics. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, some studies have demonstrated that increased
respiratory drive is associated with worse clinical outcomes while others have demonstrated contrary findings.
We have also demonstrated that a noninvasive assessment of gas exchange using the alveolar gas meter
(AGM) is predictive of who will require supplemental oxygen from COVID-19 infection. Additional studies
predating the COVID-19 pandemic showed that increased inspiratory effort, large transpulmonary pressure
changes, and elevated dead space were all associated with worse outcomes in ARDS. However, many of
these studies focused on patients already intubated and mechanically ventilated. Less is known about the
relevance of these parameters in spontaneously breathing individuals. For a few years now the notion of
patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) has been gaining traction in the medical literature. The basic concept is
that patients with impending respiratory failure from existing lung injury can cause worsening damage to their
lungs. If patients are spontaneously breathing with excessively high respiratory drive, then they may generate
excessively negative inspiratory efforts leading to major transpulmonary pressure changes. The results of
these abnormalities are large tidal volumes like mechanically ventilating someone with injurious tidal volumes
prior to the advent of low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV). Also, retrospective review of large cohort studies and
randomized controlled trials of ARDS patients have demonstrated that spontaneously breathing patients prior
to intubation often generated excessively large tidal volumes. Whether their subsequent lung injury was
entirely due to their underlying ARDS pathology or partially due to superimposed P-SILI is not known. If a
physiological signature of impending respiratory failure in spontaneously breathing individuals exists and it is
associated with elevated respiratory drive, steps can subsequently be taken to mitigate the increased drive and
study the longitudinal effects of these variables in patients who develop respiratory failure. Moreover, if such a
signature exists and intervention abrogates some of the subsequent lung injury, this is a strong proof of
concept for P-SILI in vivo. We aim to test three independent but related hypotheses. First, the AGM is a novel
and simple technique which can be used to identify patients at increased risk for respiratory failure better than
traditional metrics. Second, the breath hold maneuver is a validated technique to assess control of breathing
that can identify patients with poor respiratory prognosis. Third, the airway occlusion pressure will provide
additional predictive value in identifying high risk patients. This proposal will lay the groundwork for the PI to
gain experience and training for a long and productive academic medical career."
10937996,"Abstract
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by inappropriate immune cell infiltration within the colon and
incidence of this disease grows annually. With currently no cure, patients can only mitigate symptoms through
surgery and immunosuppressants. An extracellular matrix component, hyaluronan (HA), is synthesized into
cable-like structures during inflammation that act as attachment sites for recruited leukocytes. Platelets bind to
these cables and degrade the HA and this capability to metabolize HA is lost during IBD. These HA fragments
have pro-inflammatory effects when released into circulation. How platelets recognize HA, however, is unknown.
Our long-term goal is to determine a potential drug target for non-invasive treatment in IBD patients by targeting
HA receptors on platelets. We have previously found that, contrary to what would be expected, the predominant
HA receptor on platelets is not CD44, but the understudied receptor, layilin. The objective of this proposal is to
utilize both human IBD patients and murine platelets to determine the role of the hyaluronan receptor, layilin, in
platelets. This receptor is downregulated in IBD patients, correlating to the well-documented platelet dysfunction
in patients. Preliminary results show that inhibiting this receptor results in loss of platelet aggregation, spreading,
and HA degradation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dysregulation of platelet-driven HA
metabolism enhances recruitment and activation of CD44-expressing cells, such as leukocytes, into the intestinal
microvasculature. The rationale for this project is that layilin could be a novel target for treatment of platelet
dysregulation in chronic inflammatory diseases. It may be acting as a negative regulator for platelet activation
based on our preliminary results. The central hypothesis will be tested by examining two specific aims: 1) to
determine how layilin mediates cell signaling driving platelet activation and 2) to determine the mechanism by
which layilin influences inflammation in a murine model of colitis. This approach is innovative because it targets
the understudied receptor in hyperactive platelets, a cell type not extensively investigated in disease progression
of IBD. In the final aim, we will also be utilizing platelet specific LAYN KO (PF4-Cre LAYNfl/fl) and WT mice to
produce a novel murine model for ulcerative colitis. The proposed research is significant because we anticipate
this research to develop a non-invasive treatment for thromboinflammatory diseases."
10757055,"ABSTRACT
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and highly disabling psychiatric disorder. Pathological
fear is at the core of PTSD, and accordingly, neural accounts of PTSD have emphasized dysfunctions of
the fear system (primarily, the amygdala-prefrontal-cortex fear circuit). Motivated by recent expansion of
the fear circuit into the sensory cortex and growing recognition of rich sensory anomalies in PTSD, we
have proposed a neurosensory account of PTSD, integrating basic sensory cortical pathophysiology with
amygdala-prefrontal-cortex dysfunctions into a tripartite Sensory-Prefrontal-cortex-Amygdala (SPA)
pathology of PTSD. Specifically, we propose that PTSD involves sensory cortical disinhibition that
exacerbates amygdala-prefrontal-cortex dysfunctions, which in turn impairs top-down regulation, resulting
in a vicious cycle of SPA pathology.
The current project seeks to elucidate three specific mechanisms in this account: (Aim 1) Intrinsic (tonic)
sensory cortical disinhibition that maintains SPA pathology in PTSD (by sustaining intrinsic amygdala-
prefrontal-cortex dysfunctions with excessive spontaneous sensory afferents); (Aim 2) Novelty-related
(phasic) sensory cortical disinhibition that drives SPA pathology in PTSD (by heightening sensory cortical
reactivity to novel cues, resulting in excessive sensory output that drives amygdala-prefrontal-cortex
dysfunctional response to novelty); and (Aim 3) Threat-related sensory cortical disinhibition that
exacerbates SPA pathology and threat biases in PTSD (by heightening sensory cortical reactivity to threat
stimuli and synergizing with biased sensory cortical encoding of threat, resulting in excessive, threat-laden
sensory output that exacerbates amygdala-prefrontal-cortex dysfunctional response to threat). This
project will leverage our fully-developed cutting-edge methodology of simultaneous EEG-fMRI combined
with non-invasive neuromodulation (specifically, transcranial alternating current stimulation/tACS to
enhance sensory cortical inhibition), thereby permitting integrative spatial and temporal assays and causal
inferences. This mechanistic investigation has the potential to break new theoretical ground by revealing a
tripartite SPA pathology of PTSD. Clinically, identification of sensory cortical disinhibition as a
fundamental mechanism that is malleable (via neuromodulation) would open a new line of mechanism-
based treatments for PTSD."

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for ~75% of kidney cancers and is the 8th leading cause of
cancer death in the United States. After completion of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project, clinically
actionable mutations were identified in virtually every solid tumor. One major exception, however, is RCC,
where the current standard of care, checkpoint inhibitor and anti-VEGF therapy, does not take into account that
~50% of RCCs have mutations in chromatin regulators. After first-line therapy, response rates are 20% and
there are no FDA-approved therapies that target chromatin regulators, highlighting the need to identify how
loss-of-function genotypes can be therapeutically targeted. The epigenome is profoundly disrupted in cancers
including ccRCC. Aside from the near ubiquitous loss of VHL, the mutational landscape of ccRCC is dominated
by loss-of-function mutations in epigenetic regulators, including SETD2, BAP1, and PBRM1. SETD2 loss has
now been firmly linked to poor outcome and metastasis. The molecular phenotype of H3K36me3 deregulation
in SETD2-mutant ccRCC makes this an ideal scenario to study from the angle of synthetic lethality because it
induces global epigenetic changes that must be compensated for, creating unique vulnerabilities. Targeting
factors that exhibit genetic epistasis with known cancer mutations to drive a synthetic lethal phenotype is a
proven therapeutic approach. We performed an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify factors that exhibit
synthetic lethality with SETD2 loss-of-function. The epigenetic factor NSD1, a writer of H3K36me1/2 acting
through the H3K36 pathway, was identified. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that suppression of the
H3K36 axis in the form of its epigenetic writers (NSD1 in a SETD2 loss context) drives a synthetic lethal
phenotype mediated by distinct enhancer remodeling accompanied by expression defects incompatible with
cell viability. Identification of NSD1, which is part of a larger family of three related proteins (NSD1/2/3) within
the H3K36 signaling axis in turn, will lead to novel approaches for individualized therapeutics to target SETD2
loss-of-function, classically defined as ‘undruggable’. We will address this hypothesis with three aims. In aim 1
we functionally characterize the synthetic lethal phenotypes associated with H3K36 writers NSD1, NSD2, and
NSD3 in isogenic SETD2 ccRCC cell lines. In aim 2 we demonstrate the utility of pharmacologic inhibitors of
H3K36 signaling in driving synthetic lethality in SETD2-mutant cells and elucidate their biological
underpinnings. Finally, in aim 3 we validate the efficacy and specificity of genetic and pharmacologic targeting
of the H3K36 signaling axis to induce SETD2-mutant synthetic lethality in vivo using mouse models. Our
studies will shed new light on how epigenetic regulators and the H3K36 axis specifically, drive cancer and
metastasis when deregulated. This is expected to positively affect human health by generating preclinical
evidence for new ways to treat SETD2-mutant ccRCC that will minimize off-target side effects, and enhance
survival for patients with ccRCC, particularly those with more aggressive/metastatic disease."
10813857,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with high co-
morbidity for intellectual disability. This includes difficulties forming episodic, personal narrative, memories that
are critical for orderly thinking and organizing future behaviors. Episodic memory deficits are thus thought to be
major contributors to cognitive difficulties associated with autism. Many brain changes underlying abnormalities
in ASD appear in childhood suggesting the possibility for effective therapeutic strategies targeting brain
maturation. One candidate therapeutic is the hypothalamic peptide Oxytocin (OXT). Postnatal OXT treatment
improves social behavior in animal models of ASDs and recent work indicates that treatment in childhood
improves social interactions in autistic individuals. OXT acutely facilitates forms of synaptic plasticity, but there
has been little experimental consideration of possible enduring effects of postnatal OXT treatment on learning
and no analyses of effects on episodic memory. We examined this possibility using intranasal OXT (iOXT)
treatment in the Fmr1 KO mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome, and novel paradigms for analyses of `What,
When and Where' encoding. Our preliminary results show that in Fmr1 KOs iOXT treatments during the
second postnatal week (P7-13) fully rescue hippocampal field CA1 long-term potentiation, object location
memory, object identity (What) learning, and social recognition as assessed in adulthood (i.e., >40d after the
last treatment). These findings raise the exciting possibility that a limited period of early life OXT treatment can
effect a life-long rescue of a critical element of cognitive function in ASD. They also raise questions as to the
breadth of effects iOXT has on behavior and the mechanisms involved; these questions will be addressed in
the proposed studies. Aim 1 studies will test if postnatal iOXT treatment of male and female Fmr1 KO mice
rescues encoding for the three major components of episodic memory, social recognition and stereotypic
behavior as assessed in adulthood, and if effects depend on native OXT efflux. We will also determine if there
is a critical period for enduring iOXT effects on behavior. Aim 2 will use electrophysiological recordings of
evoked responses and network activity, analyses of synaptic proteins and signaling, and measures of neuronal
arbors to test if postnatal iOXT treatment normalizes neurobiological processes in the distinct hippocampal
subdivisions related to episodic memory encoding. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that early life iOXT
leads to activation of synaptic trophic factor receptors (EGFR, TrkB) in hippocampus, thereby suggesting a
direct route for OXT effects on maturational changes in the structure. Overall, the proposed studies will greatly
expand our current knowledge of OXT actions in the young brain, including potentially critical roles in
regulating hippocampal development and synaptic function. Moreover, the results will lay the groundwork for
designing novel, early life regimens to optimize hippocampal maturation and function, and to rescue the
encoding of episodic memories in ASD and related developmental disorders."

The leading cause of end stage renal disease among children under 5 years is congenital abnormalities of the
kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). Among the several genetic mutations that have been linked to CAKUT are
mutations in Notch signaling pathway genes, JAG1 and NOTCH2. Mutations in these Notch pathway genes are
predicted to reduce the level of Notch signaling activity, and are associated with Alagille Syndrome (ALGS). One
component of ALGS is the variable occurrence of kidney disease including that of small multicystic, dysplastic
kidneys. For instance, a retrospective study determined that 40% of ALGS patients with JAG1 mutations had
some form of kidney disease with dysplastic kidneys with or without cysts occurring in 60% of ALGS patients
with kidney disease. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Notch signaling ensures
normal kidney development and maintenance are poorly understood. We know that JAG1 can function as a
ligand to activate NOTCH2, and assume the canonical Notch signaling pathway prevents kidney disease
associated with ALGS. However, mutations in the other canonical Notch signaling pathway components have
not been associated with ALGS. Additionally, the high degree of variability in the manifestation of kidney disease
among ALGS patients is puzzling. In our mouse models the severity of multi-cystic kidney disease increases
with increasing number of Notch1 and Notch2 alleles inactivated in the developing renal epithelium. Here we
propose to determine the Renal Epithelial Notch Signaling Network (RENSN) and perform whole exome
sequencing of ALGS patients to determine if additional variations in RENSN genes in addition to JAG1 and/or
NOTCH2 determine the occurrence of multicystic/dysplastic kidneys in ALGS. Additionally, we will test if
NOTCH2 mutations associated with ALGS alter the orientation of renal epithelial cell division, primary cilia
structure and expression of renal epithelial Notch target genes in different renal epithelial cell cultures. We will
also determine the proximal interacting proteins of wild type versus ALGS associated NOTCH2 variants using
BioID. Additionally, we will apply three strategies to molecularly intervene and prevent the Notch-signaling-
deficient kidney defects. These studies will establish the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of kidney
disease associated with ALGS and identify methods to increase Notch signaling specifically in kidney cell types
by determining the molecular interface between Notch signaling and renal epithelial functions."

 Central functions in DNA biology and biotechnology are carried out by nucleoprotein
machines. In these dynamic macromolecular assemblies, the DNA duplex is bound and
distorted in complex with protein and sometimes RNA. Biophysical measurements and
models are needed to understand the mechanisms of these machines, in which coordinated
conformational changes in protein and nucleic acid components are coupled with chemical
steps such as backbone cleavage or nucleotide hydrolysis. This is a renewal application for
a grant in which we previously developed high-resolution and multimodal single-molecule
approaches and applied them to elucidate mechanochemical coupling in the ATP-dependent
supercoiling motor DNA gyrase from E. coli. Here, we propose to leverage our methods and
insights to dissect the dynamics and mechanics of additional nucleoprotein machines,
focusing on the RNA-guided nucleases Cas9 and Cas12a and comparing DNA gyrase motors
across species. We will characterize substeps in DNA interrogation and DNA supercoiling,
molecular determinants of energy landscapes and kinetics, and the effects of mechanical
strains experienced in the genome. If successful, the project will determine the physical
mechanisms of DNA interrogation by RNA-guided nucleases in dynamic and mechanical
detail, providing a quantitative description of the target search process for enzymes that are
currently being exploited for gene editing and for a rapidly expanding set of other applications
involving specific targeting of activities to sites in the genome. New DNA gyrase
measurements will further elucidate biophysical specializations, structural properties, and
mechanical regulation of enzymes that are important targets for antibacterial drugs. Finally,
single-molecule methods development driven by these biophysical questions will have broad
applications in systems ranging from transcription to nucleosome remodeling."

Acquired disorders of language, such as aphasia, can have devastating effects on an
individual’s quality of life and livelihood. Up to 2,000,000 people in North America have aphasia
making it a significant public health concern. The goal of Project 4 is to improve our ability to
diagnosis, treat, and predict recovery from aphasia using quantitative and theoretical models of
how language works and how it is implemented in the brain. As part of the Center for the Study
of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR), this project has three specific aims: (1) to apply our MPT model
to treatment outcome evaluation and recovery prediction, (2) to extend our quantitative and
neural model of word production, and (3) to extend our theoretical scope to include syntax.
Although Project 4 has a bit more theoretical slant that the other three Projects, we have made
a concerted effort to also emphasize the clinical application of the project."
10817181,"Summary (Neuroimaging Core)
The purpose of the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR) is to better understand how aphasia
therapy and factors such as genetics, serotonin, and brain health influence aphasia recovery. The proposed
work acquires brain imaging data in multiple modalities at different time points following stroke. The mission of
the Neuroimaging Core is to integrate data from each of the clinical sites to optimally support the objectives of
the research projects. First, the neuroimaging core will receive, deidentify and archive neuroimaging and
behavioral data from each clinical site. Second, the Neuroimaging Core will be responsible for processing
these data using state-of-the-art tools. Third, the Neuroimaging Core will support and refine the tools we have
developed to better allow each research team to analyze their data and address specific research aims.
Fourth, the Neuroimaging Core will provide tools that aid in visualization of brain data. The Neuroimaging Core
will make it possible for outside investigators to leverage the tools and data associated with this project. The
proposed work will allow the neuroimaging team to continue to refine, validate, showcase, and disseminate the

10839834,"The long-term objective of the Mouse Cardiac Physiology Core is to consolidate the scientific and technical
expertise and the specialized equipment necessary to provide: a) standardized, high-quality, and appropriate
microsurgery for the induction of chronic heart failure in mice; and b) rigorous, reliable, and accurate in vivo
assessment of mouse cardiac physiology. All four projects proposed in this Program Project Grant rely heavily
on mouse models of heart failure to test hypotheses about regulatory mechanisms of cardiomyocyte calcium
channels in health and cardiac disease. Excitation-contraction coupling, contractility, and cardiac remodeling
all require the intricate regulation and coordination of cardiomyocyte calcium channel subunits and their
interactomes. Even as investigators focus on studying human loss of function variants, genetically modified
mice are indispensable to deciphering the regulatory function of the gene variants. Given that, at times, cardiac
genotype-phenotype associations are evidenced only under stress conditions, it will be imperative to examine
cardiac structure and function of transgenic mice under baseline conditions and following chronic cardiac
stress. As such, the Mouse Cardiac Physiology Core will address three specific aims:
 1. Performing survival microsurgeries on mice to induce either chronic pressure-overload or chronic
 ischemic stress upon the left ventricle. This will be accomplished through transverse aortic constriction
 and left coronary artery ligation, respectively.
 2. Assessing in vivo cardiac structure and function of experimental mice over time via serial
echocardiograms.
 3. Determining the left ventricular pressure-volume relationship using in vivo invasive conductance
 catheter measurements.
By streamlining these essential procedures and analyses, the Mouse Cardiac Physiology Core will accelerate
the pace at which our Investigators obtain invaluable insights into the structure and function of calcium channel
complexes in cardiac physiology and disease. Thus ,our work in the Mouse Cardiac Physiology Core will be
synergistic with that of the four individual program projects and the Human Phenotyping Core. We expect that
our cumulative findings will identify clinically relevant regulatory mechanisms and structure-function
relationships that can then facilitate novel therapeutic developments and interventions."
10834125,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dramatic effects on the
affected individuals and their families. While the characterization of the genetic contribution to AD and
underlying molecular mechanisms have advanced the understanding of the disease in recent years, studies
show that sex differences account for much of the observed differences in risk, progression, and severity
across individuals. Here, we directly dissect the contribution of sex-specific variation down to the region-
specific and cell-type-specific molecular basis by systematic profiling, computational integration, and
experimental validation of the transcriptional, epigenomic, and genetic signatures across individuals, brain
regions, and cell types. In Aim 1, we use genetic, epigenomic, and transcriptional profiles, generating millions
of single-cell (sc) level maps using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq across human and mouse samples of varying
ages and genetic risk status. In Aim 2, we analyze the resulting datasets in the context of known AD genetic
risk variation and underlying molecular mechanisms, enabling us to discover and converge variants, regulatory
regions, genes, pathways, cell types, and brain regions to functional, causal mechanisms that drive sex-related
differences. In Aim 3, we use our well-established mouse and iPSC models to test our predicted mechanisms
with both high-throughput and cell-type specific assays. The resulting datasets, computational predictions, and
experimentally-supported mechanisms will shed light on the sex-related differences of AD and will help deepen
our understanding the disease in general as we develop more personalized therapeutic approaches in treating
AD."

that multiple immunologic strategies will need to be explored and combined to achieve long-term, ART-
free virologic control or complete virus eradication, with the goal of selecting combination regimens to
advance into clinical development by the end of the proposed period of support. We propose three

10815547,"Abstract: Opioid analgesics are commonly used to manage children’s postoperative pain. Under-medication of
children’s postsurgical pain can have significant consequences including reduced quality of life, respiratory
issues, dehydration, and nausea, which can increase health care costs due to emergency department visits,
provider phone calls, and readmissions. In contrast, a proportion of parents may over-medicate children’s
postsurgical pain, potentially leading to greater respiratory depression and other opioid side effects. Given (a)
the potential repercussions of under- or over-medicating postsurgical pain in children, (b) uncertainty regarding
level of opioid analgesics needed for optimal postsurgical pain management, and (c) increasing societal focus
on the negative consequences of opioid medications, further understanding the patterns and predictors of
home opioid use and pain management following surgical procedures in children is necessary to guide
development of interventions to enhance appropriate analgesic use for pediatric postsurgical pain. The
proposed project is designed to address this gap in understanding by prospectively examining parent and child
predictors of the extent of opioid analgesic use following tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) procedures in
pediatric patients aged 7 to 12 years. Parents and youth will complete preoperative measures regarding opioid
medication beliefs, pain-related beliefs and emotional responses, and history of painful experiences and opioid
use. At the time of IV placement for surgery, blood will be collected to assess children’s circulating
endocannabinoid levels. Following surgery, parents and youth will complete electronic diaries regarding pain,
emotions, medication use, and side-effects 3 times a day for 7 days and a 3-month follow-up survey assessing
additional opioid use and opioid disposal. The central aims of this proposal are to understand parent and child
factors that may predict opioid analgesic use following T&A procedures in order to inform predictive models for
opioid-related outcomes following pediatric surgeries more broadly. A key innovation of this project is the
examination of joint influences of parent and child factors on postoperative opioid use patterns. We
hypothesize that parents and children who tend to catastrophize more about painful experiences, have positive
beliefs regarding opioid efficacy, and less negative beliefs regarding opioid side effects will be more likely to
use opioid medications and be less likely to dispose of opioid medications. Identifying these parent and child
predictors could allow for the development of targeted screening and patient education in order to identify
potentially modifiable targets for interventions to improve pediatric postsurgical pain management and reduce
opioid-related risks. Further, this project provides critical career development support for a young investigator
focused on developing expertise in pediatric acute pain, opioid guidelines and clinical opioid use patterns,
advanced statistical modeling skill, leadership skills, and biological mechanisms related to pain and opioid use
which will inform an overall program of research focused on improving pain management practices for children."
10830273,"ABSTRACT
Exosomes are lipid-encapsulated small vesicles secreted by cells to the extracellular milieu, and are recently
recognized as a novel and highly effective means of cell-cell communication. Exosomes carry bioactive molecules
such as signaling proteins and microRNAs that potently affect the behavior and function of their recipient cells.
Studies in recent years have implicated the exosomes in a wide range of pathophysiological processes such as
organogenesis, viral propagation, tumor metastasis and immune suppression. Despite the great interest in
exosomes in various fields, the basic cell biological understanding of exosomes is disproportionally lacking. The
biogenesis of exosomes starts when the limiting membrane of endosomes invaginates to form intraluminal
vesicles (ILVs). These endosomes, called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), are then transported to the cell periphery
for the release of the ILVs–the exosomes. While the biogenesis of MVBs is mostly mediated by the ESCRT
complex, the molecular machinery that mediates the transport of MVBs to the cell periphery, and their subsequent
docking and fusion with the plasma membrane for exosome release, remains elusive. In addition, how the
biogenesis and intracellular trafficking of the exosomes are regulated by signaling molecules is largely unknown.
The goal of our research is to identify the basic machinery that mediating the intracellular trafficking of the
exosomes, and to elucidate how oncogenic signaling control these processes for tumor progression. First, we will
study several classes of proteins including the Rab family of small GTPases, the octameric exocyst complex, and
microtubule motor proteins, and understand how they function in concert in the transport, docking and fusion of
MVBs to the plasma membrane. These work will lay the foundation for the basic cell biological understanding of
exosome secretion. Second, we will identify and characterize oncogenic signaling pathways that regulate various
aspects of exosome trafficking, from exosome protein cargo selection, to exosome release at the plasma
membrane. At the functional level, we will study how tumor cell-intrinsic signaling pathways such as the Mitogen-
Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) axis, through the exosomes, influence tumor microenvironment and the immune
system to promote tumor growth and immune evasion. A multidisciplinary approach that combines biochemistry,
cell biology, tumor biology, and immunobiology will be taken to address these questions. Our study will bridge
basic exosome cell biology to cancer biology. It will not only lay the cell biological foundation for the molecular
and mechanistic understanding of exosomes, but also open new venues for therapeutic targeting of exosomes in
cancer."
10834195,"Project Summary
The plant hormone auxin regulates virtually all aspects of plant growth and development. We and others have
demonstrated that auxin promotes degradation of transcriptional repressors called Aux/IAA proteins, via a
family E3 ligases called SCFTIR1/AFB. Auxin is perceived by a co-receptor consisting of a TIR1/AFB protein, the F-
box subunit of the E3, and the Aux/IAA protein. The formation of this complex promotes degradation of the
Aux/IAA protein and transcription by ARF transcription factors. Although this basic pathway is well
established, it is not clear how auxin regulates such a wide range of developmental and physiological processes.
Currently in the second year of our RO1 grant, we are investigating this broad question using two
complementary genetic systems; the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the basal land plant
Physcomitrella patens. Our focus has been on the function of the TIR1/AFB proteins, regulation of Aux/IAA
level, and the architecture of the auxin signaling network. We recently demonstrated that 5 of the 6 member
TIR1/AFB family in Arabidopsis act in an overlapping fashion. The 6th member, AFB1, functions in a novel
transcription-independent auxin response pathway. Further, our recent ChIPseq experiments indicate that
TIR1/AFB proteins (excluding AFB1) are recruited by auxin to chromatin adjacent to auxin-regulated genes.
We speculate that this mechanism permits rapid de-repression of auxin responsive genes. We also made
significant advances in our understanding of Aux/IAA proteins and their regulation. We recently discovered
that Aux/IAA are substrates of E3 ligases called CRL3-BPM, in addition to SCFTIR1/AFB. The BPMs are orthologs
of the human SPOP proteins. In addition, we showed that the Aux/IAA genes are regulatory nodes that
integrate environmental signals with the auxin gene regulatory network. For example, we have shown that
certain Aux/IAA proteins confer drought tolerance by regulating the levels of secondary products called
glucosinolates. These compounds promote stomatal closure and drought tolerance. In the next 5 years we will
continue to investigate the molecular basis of auxin signaling and to characterize the auxin-based regulatory
networks that control plant growth and development. We are very interested in the novel rapid auxin response
pathway and its role in growth. We will also investigate the regulation of Aux/IAA levels by both SCFTIR1/AFB
and CRL3-BPM. One of our long-term goals is understand the specificity of the AFB, Aux/IAA, and ARF
proteins in collaboration with Joe Ecker's lab at the Salk Institute. This effort will include the investigation of
AFB recruitment to chromatin. These studies address a number of key issues in cellular regulation and will
have important implications for human health."

Research: Insulin resistance is a major cause for type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and is implicated in many life-
threatening complications of T2D. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms for insulin resistance is
essential to develop potent and safe insulin sensitizers, which could reduce the social and economic burden of
metabolic diseases. Our lab discovered a novel class of anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic lipids, Palmitic Acid
Hydroxy Stearic Acids (PAHSAs). PAHSA levels strongly correlate with insulin sensitivity in humans and are
down-regulated in adipose tissue (AT) from insulin resistant subjects. PAHSAs are potent hepatic and systemic
insulin sensitizers in obese T2D mice. This project will identify the mechanisms for the regulation of PAHSAs in
altered metabolic states in vivo and the enzymes mediating their biosynthesis and degradation, providing novel
strategies to prevent or treat T2D. Specific Aim1: To determine the mechanisms that regulate PAHSA levels in
vivo. Specific Aim2: To identify candidate enzymes for PAHSA biosynthesis and degradation in our unique
genetic mouse models of altered glucose homeostasis. Specific Aim3: To identify natural genetic drivers of
PAHSA metabolism using the established profiling of the natural genetic variation among 8 mouse strains to
mimick human variation. These studies will uncover novel pathways at the crossroad between AT lipogenesis
and insulin sensitivity that can be manipulated to prevent or treat T2D.
Candidate’s career development plan and career goals: I am highly committed to elucidate the mechanisms
for insulin resistance and T2D with the ultimate goal of expanding the therapeutic armamentarium for T2D. During
my postdoctoral training in Dr. Barbara’s Kahn lab, I became interested in the connections between AT
lipogenesis and systemic insulin sensitivity. During the K01 award, I will acquire the necessary skills to study
lipid metabolism in vivo combining innovative and powerful multiomic approaches and molecular biology. The
studies in this K01 proposal will be conducted under the mentorship of Drs. Kahn and Saghatelian with the
guidance of an outstanding scientific advisory committee (Drs. Alan Attie, Joshua Rabinowitz, and Evan Rosen),
who are highly committed to my development into an independent scientist. Periodic meetings with these experts
will center on experimental design, discussion of results, future directions, and preparation of R01 and R03
grants. My long-term career goal is to become an NIH-funded independent scientist. The training received during
this K01 award is necessary for my successful transition to independent investigator in the Academia.
Environment: The BIDMC Endocrine Division is the ideal site for training of young scientists towards a path of
independence because it offers unparalleled opportunities for interactions with leaders in the fields of diabetes
and metabolism. Graduates from this Division have made transformative discoveries that open new trajectories
for diabetes and metabolism research."

Esophageal stratified squamous epithelia comprise proliferative basal cells that undergo terminal differentiation
in the suprabasal cell layer. This homeostatic proliferation-differentiation gradient is regulated by Notch
signaling that is impaired in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by
mucosal eosinophilic infiltration, basal cell hyperplasia (BCH) and subepithelial fibrosis. BCH contributes to a
barrier defect that facilitates lamina propria remodeling, culminating in fibrotic esophageal strictures that
severely affect patients’ quality of life. While food allergen-activated immune cells and cytokines mediate EoE
pathogenesis, the relationship between esophageal epithelial biology and EoE pathogenesis remains elusive.
The ongoing project (R01-114436) has established the role of autophagy, a highly conserved cellular stress
response, as a fundamental mucosal defense mechanism in EoE. Epithelial autophagy activation involves
mitochondrial stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by proinflammatory EoE-relevant cytokines
such as IL-13, which in turn stimulate BCH. BCH features depletion of CD73+ basal cells and reciprocal
expansion of CD73- cells with low Notch activity, thereby limiting terminal differentiation. IL-13 promotes BCH
by inhibiting Notch while inducing ROS-mediated mitochondrial (mt) damage marked by mtDNA depletion.
Moreover, CD73- cells may maintain BCH via Notch-independent epithelial renewal. The overall objective in
this competing renewal application is to elucidate the nature of basal cell fate regulation in EoE pathogenesis.
The central hypothesis is that EoE-related inflammation influences basal cells’ activity to promote esophageal
tissue remodeling. This hypothesis has been formulated based upon strong preliminary data and publications
from the applicant’s laboratory and will be pursued through the following interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To
elucidate how autophagy activation limits BCH in the EoE inflammatory milieu; (2) To delineate the role of
mitochondrial damage in EoE-related BCH; (3) To unravel how Notch signaling protects against tissue
remodeling in EoE. The present proposal utilizes a robust murine model of EoE with squamous epithelia-
specific autophagy impairment, mtDNA depletion, or Notch inhibition with concurrent basal cell lineage tracing.
These approaches are coupled with ex vivo esophageal 3D organoids from EoE mice and patient biopsies to
define the mechanistic and functional role of autophagy and mitochondria in basal cell homeostasis. These
innovative studies will reveal novel insights into esophageal basal cell biology and tissue remodeling. With
genetically engineered mice, 3D organoids and patient biopsies, we will build a comprehensive platform for the
development and validation of novel translational applications related to EoE therapy (autophagy activation
and mitochondria-targeted antioxidants). These findings may have direct clinical impact in EoE, and potentially
other diseases (e.g. GERD) where autophagy, epithelial barrier defects and fibrosis have been implicated."

10842227,"Despite the clinical importance of the right ventricle (RV) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), surprisingly
little is known about the molecular and structural mechanisms of RV adaptive and maladaptive remodeling and
the transition to RV failure. This is particularly important when the RV is not the primary cause of RV failure,
but when a temporary support of the RV would be desirable until the primary cause can be fixed.
Approaches that normalize pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and reduce RV afterload would improve RV
function and reverse RV failure. Unfortunately, no currently available medical therapy is able to significantly
reduce PVR long-term in chronic PAH or thromboembolic PH (CTEPH). As RV failure is the most common
cause of death in PAH, approaches to support the RV to better adapt to an increased afterload are highly
sought after. In this proposal, we will focus on two pathological features that put the RV uniquely at risk for
failure: (1) cardiac fibrosis, that reduces RV systolic/diastolic function, disrupts the myocardial architecture, and
impairs the exchange of oxygen/nutrients and (2) impaired microvascular adaptation (= capillary rarefaction)
that results in RV ischemia. Both are controversially debated as to their role in RV adaptation, failure as well
as in recovery. We use a novel mouse model of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) and de-banding (de-PAB) to
quantitatively capture histological changes in the RV using 3-D deep tissue imaging and to link them to cardiac
function with cardiac MRI (CMR). As a deficiency in Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) signaling
is thought to put the RV at risk for failure, we evaluate whether two repurposed drugs, Tacrolimus (FK506)
and Enzastaurin, previously shown by our group to increase BMPR2 signaling, assist the RV by reducing
cardiac fibrosis and improving vascular adaptation and accelerate recovery. Moreover, we have identified early,
RV specific expression of SNAIL1 in cardiac fibroblasts as a promising and druggable target to improved
cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize that Inhibiting Snail and increasing BMPR2 with FK506 and Enzastaurin will
reduce cardiac fibrosis, improve capillary density and improve RV function in the pressure overloaded murine
RV. Our proposal has three significant parts, which are represented by our three specific aims: First, we will
target molecular events that govern RV fibrosis in the pressure overloaded RV with genetic tools and
repurposed drugs to improve RV function and strain as assessed by CMR in PAB mice. Second, we will
characterize the adaptation of the RV microvasculature in PAB mice and human RV PH tissue, construct a 3-
D model of the RV microcirculation to predict how structural changes in the RV influence fluid and diffusion
dynamics and third, we will study histological and functional recovery of the RV in a novel de-banding mouse
model. By studying and targeting RV adaptation and failure, we not only address the most important
cause of mortality in PAH but also help improve other diseases, in which the RV is uniquely at risk for
failure such as in chronic lung and left heart disease, CTEPH as well as congenital heart disease."

Lentiviruses such as HIV-1 are uniquely efficient in their ability to infect non-dividing cells through the hijacking
of cellular nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways. Nuclear import of primate lentiviruses is inhibited by the
interferon inducible GTPase Mx2, which localizes to the nuclear pore complex. However, the process by which
HIV-1 utilizes cellular nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and how nuclear entry is inhibited by Mx2 remain poorly
defined. Furthermore, the relationship between Mx2 and other cellular proteins that affect the pre-integration
stages of HIV-1 infection is not understood. We have previously demonstrated that the antiviral activity of Mx2
is affected by cellular nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways in a cell-type, cell-cycle, and HIV-1 capsid-
dependent manner. We further determined that Mx2 inhibits nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of non-viral cargo in a
cell-type dependent manner, indicating that it may have broader functions in antiviral interferon responses. Here,
we aim to determine how Mx2 is localized to the nuclear pore complex, the nuclear import pathways that are
inhibited by Mx2, how Mx2 is affected be heterogeneity in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, and how Mx2 affects
the interaction of HIV-1 with other antiviral proteins."

10884169,"Advances in imaging technology lead to discoveries in science and medicine. Conversely, pressing questions in
science and medicine drive innovation in imaging technology development, underscoring the fundamental
symbiosis between imaging and biomedical research. The necessity to connect imaging and biomedical science
is particularly salient in cardiovascular research, where imaging the heart and vascular system, from whole organ
to molecular levels, figures prominently in the translation of discoveries to bedside diagnosis and treatment. As
such, imaging scientists must understand what questions are important in biomedical research, while biomedical
scientists must be fluent in the imaging technologies that can facilitate discovery. Our inaugural T32 program
(2016)– the first in Cardiology at University of Pittsburgh – was motivated by the recognition that there is a paucity
of scientists who can adeptly commute between the imaging science and biomedical research spheres,
ultimately compromising the translational relevance of research efforts, and contributing to the “Valley of Death”
separating basic discovery and clinical application. To bridge this chasm, our new T32 Program used an
innovative educational paradigm to train clinical and basic researchers in a broad spectrum of cutting-edge,
multimodality imaging platforms as they pursue hypothesis-driven research, with an emphasis on translational
cardiovascular research. While T32s at other institutions focus on traditional cardiovascular imaging tools (e.g.,
MRI, Echo), our T32 is unique in integrating biological imaging within the biological and physical sciences. Our
program was designed such that post-doctoral trainees (MD or PhD) acquire “core competencies” in imaging
methods spanning molecular to whole organism (“imaging tool kit”), and translational research methods spanning
basic to population levels (“translational tool kit’) – accomplished through a co-mentorship structure, with each
trainee having one mentor from imaging sciences and another from the biomedical science arena. Our approach
is structured around Individualized Development Plans that have quantifiable milestones, e.g., presentations,
publications, grants, didactic courses, or completion of Master’s degrees. Now 4.2 years into our first funding
cycle, we seek competitive renewal of our program based on its compelling premise and unmet training need;
its occupancy of an important niche in the NHLBI portfolio (only 2% of NHLBI T32s are imaging-focused); the 37
excellent, scientifically diverse, well-funded training faculty; and the successful outcomes of our nascent program
thus far. In our 2019 Cardiology Fellowship match for 8 positions (>700 applicants), 4 were filled by MDs
committed to our T32 program, highlighting our mandate to train future MD scientists. Dr. Villanueva, a
cardiologist, imaging specialist, and researcher with extensive mentoring experience, has ably led our young
program alongside 3 seasoned co-Directors and Advisory Boards. Our T32 is enhanced by institutional

In humans, an age-related decline in neuromuscular function is associated with loss of muscle mass
(sarcopenia), increased frailty and a degradation of both health and quality of life. The only known treatments
are life-style based, including exercise and diet. Rodent models have been used to demonstrate age-related
changes at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) including the fragmentation, remodeling and eventual
denervation of muscle. As eloquently stated by Joshua Sanes and Jeff Lichtman, “A key feature of the adult
NMJ is that it is remarkably stable under ordinary circumstances yet capable of remodeling” when perturbed by
injury or age. “This combination of stability and malleability implies that synaptic maintenance is controlled
actively, yet little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms”. This is where we have recently
advanced the field. In a recently published paper we demonstrate the power of homeostatic plasticity to
preserve neuromuscular anatomy and function with dramatic effects on organismal health, behavior and
lifespan. We refer to this as “Homeostatic Neuroprotection”. We propose to determine whether homeostatic
neuroprotection counteracts the insidious effects of age-related neuromuscular decline over the normal
lifespan of mice. This will be achieved by characterizing three independent mouse strains across the lifespan.
We provide strong preliminary data supporting an evolutionarily conserved role for all three genes in the
mechanisms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity and accelerated aging in the mouse neuromuscular system.
Age is one of the most important risk factors for nearly all neurodegenerative disorders. This line of research
may underscore the general relevance of homeostatic neuroprotection as a future therapeutic avenue to
ameliorate the adverse effects of age and neurological disease."

The IMPACT (Innovative Mentoring and Professional Advancement Through Cultural Training) Program is a
multi-dimensional, inter-institutional, collaborative mentoring program for underrepresented minority (URM)
students who are interested in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This program is a collaboration
between Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), a top US research university, and Hampton University
(HU), a top ranked Historically Black College and University (HBCU). CWRU is known for its innovation in
CSD, and it is located in a predominately Black neighborhood. HU has the oldest graduate program in
speech-language pathology (SLP) at an HBCU and has graduated more Black SLPs than any other US
program. CWRU and HU, along with their corporate and institutional partners and many peer supports, will
provide structured mentorship and professional development resources to build broad and diverse
developmental mentorship networks for the 42 and 24 undergraduate and graduate students, respectively, who
will participate in the IMPACT program throughout the five-year grant cycle. The aims of this proposal are to: 1)
build developmental networks for URM students in CSD, and 2) successfully transition students in CSD into
clinical and research graduate programs. By achieving these aims, URM students in CSD will be more likely to
pursue a career in research and the foundation will be laid for a successful research career. IMPACT Fellows
will be paired with academic, research, affinity, and peer mentors, along with writing, wellness, and career
coaches; they will meet regularly with these mentors and coaches throughout each academic year.
Undergraduate Fellows will complete at least 150 hours of learning experiences, while graduate Fellows will
complete a minimum of 50 hours. Work from this five-year proposal will be used to create both a model and a
manual for collaborative CSD mentoring programs between other minority-serving-institutions (e.g., HBCUs)
and research-intensive universities. Long-term outcomes of the IMPACT program include the achievement and
retention of URM students in CSD careers. This in turn is expected to support the broader mission of NIDCD
by improving outcomes for communication disorders in URM populations by fostering diversity of thought,
inclusive assessment, and equitable treatment in clinical CSD research."

The overall objective of the Pilot Project Core in Phase III is to sustain the research environment developed in
the first two phases by providing support for pilot research projects, career guidance, and enhancement activities.
As part of the Administrative Core in prior phases, we have awarded 25 investigators with 29 pilot projects from
multiple disciplines. These Pilot Project awardees, guided by experienced mentors, have developed new
research collaborations, published 280 manuscripts, received 93 independent extramural awards with a total
amount over $33.9 million, served as mentor for over 170 trainees, and presented at 343 invited sessions,
including 47 international, 100 national, and 196 local venues. Building on our past success, the Pilot Project
Core in Phase III, along with support from the Administrative Core, is poised to meet the needs of the Pilot Project
Investigators in the area of CPVB with professional development activities and pilot funding to test out new,
novel, innovative ideas, obtain preliminary data for grant submissions, develop techniques or scientific
approaches, and establish new collaborations. Moreover, our pool of potential pilot project applicants remains
strong and is anticipated to grow with key faculty recruitment in cardiovascular and pulmonary divisions ongoing
at Ocean State Research Institute/Providence VA Medical Center and at our affiliated hospitals and universities.
Congruent with the overarching goals of CPVB COBRE, the Specific Aims of the Pilot Projects Core are to: i)
award high-impact pilot projects in area of cardiopulmonary vascular biology; ii) promote professional
development and extramural funding of early career faculty pilot project awardees through structured
programming, mentorship, and exposure to leaders in the field; iii) facilitate new collaborations and research
teams through prioritization of interdisciplinary, interinstitutional, and bench to bedside collaborations; and iv)
enhance the user base for technical core services and leverage stakeholders to sustain pilot funding in CPVB.

COBRE technical core expertise and services and professional development activities, will be critical to retain
early career faculty and faculty focused on vascular biology in RI."
10868442,"Project Summary/Abstract
The broad, long-term objectives of this proposal are to enhance the utility of cellulose-based biomaterials for
tissue repair by developing and evaluating a new and innovative composite that address current limitations.
Bacterial cellulose hydrogels and extracellular matrices have shown excellent regeneration capabilities in
multiple tissue types. However, these materials lack mechanical strength and degradation features needed for
specific applications such as bone repair, and have limited options for storage, handling, and sterilization. Plant-
derived cellulose in its derivative cellulose acetate (CA) form is capable of creating mechanically competent
porous scaffolds that are effective in bone regeneration. However, premade CA scaffolds with defined sizes,
shapes, and pore properties present challenges in adapting to complex bone defects. Additionally, the relatively
slow degradation rate of cellulose/CA can limit its ability to control factor release and heal bone. Combining CA
with CA phthalate (CAP) and nanoclay (NC) has the potential to address some of these weaknesses. This
cellulose-based composite forms a putty that can be molded into complex shapes and becomes strong as it
hardens, making it adaptable to diverse bone defects. Under physiologic conditions, CAP erodes before the
slower-degrading CA matrix, enabling a dynamic system that generates interconnected pores and tunable
growth factor release profiles and degradation. A CA/CAP/NC composite allows flexible incorporation of multiple
bioactive factors for varied effects: within CA for early, sustained release; within CAP for pulsed release; and/or
into NC embedded within the CA/CAP for delayed, sustained release. This also allows factors to be released in
parallel and/or sequentially. Detailed, long-term in vitro and in vivo characterizations of this cellulose biomaterial,
including its ability to balance strength and porosity and the effects of osteoclasts on its degradation, remain
knowledge gaps for advancing this transformative and natural biomaterial platform. Based on current knowledge,
it is hypothesized that this dynamic cellulose-based putty will impart composition-dependent changes of strength
and erosion in 3D microenvironments leading to varied bioactive factor release rates, vasculature development,
and tissue ingrowth during bone repair. This will be tested in four Specific Aims: Aim 1: Characterize
physicochemical and release properties of novel cellulose derivatives and compositions in vitro. Aim 2: Evaluate
biocompatibility and bioactivity of released molecules in an in vivo subcutaneous implantation model. Aim 3:
Evaluate cellular effects of putty formulations with early to long-term release profiles on a cranial flat-bone healing
defect. Aim 4: Assess putty formulations with early to long-term release profiles on bone healing at a load-
bearing site in a critical-sized long-bone defect in rabbit ulna. These studies will address several knowledge gaps
for using cellulose biomaterials in bone healing. If this enabling putty technology is successful, it may be
transformative to the field and adapted for other repair challenges in bone as well as a coating for biomedical
implants."

Brain Injury Training Grant
The continuing aim of the Brain Injury Training Grant (BITG) is to provide an excellent mentoring environment for
highly motivated clinician and basic scientists to prepare them for careers in nervous system injury research.
Our trainees acquire basic science research skills that address the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment,
and prevention of injury to the nervous system, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebral ischemia (stroke),
and brain repair. Since its inception in 2003, the training program has flourished. For former BITG trainees who
have finished all career training, 23 have obtained faculty positions (10 neurosurgeon academic clinicians and 13
Ph.D. academic scientists). In addition, 3 trainees joined US government biomedical research administration
(respectively, NIH, DARPA and Defense Veterans Brain Injury Center), 1 trainee is a scientific journal editor, and
3 trainees have gone on to positions in the biomedical research industry with 1 a CEO and 2 Directors. For this
competing renewal of the BITG, we request continued funding for 4 postdoctoral fellowship slots (simultaneous)
for individuals with a strong interest in studying injury to the nervous system. These positions are anticipated to
be filled by a combination of neurosurgical residents (during their strictly protected research training) and highly
qualified Ph.D. graduates. The BITG program administration will continue to be democratically governed by
group vote of faculty mentors. Day-to-day management will be entrusted to an Executive Committee. An External
Advisory Committee will evaluate the program annually providing insightful suggestions for areas of
improvement. For training, the research project will typically be based in an individual laboratory. Trainees will
actively participate in selecting the mentor and laboratory. To become integrated with the greater BITG
community and research program, trainees will engage in multiple activities, such as mandatory and optional
course work, seminars and scientific retreats. New to this application, is the addition of a dedicated BITG
statistician that will provide a series of lectures, one-on-one instruction and be available for consultation. Unique
to this program, trainees will also participate in patient outreach events and they will perform community service.
In addition, we have established a plan to continue and enhance our successful efforts on diversity recruitment.
This includes a designated Diversity Recruitment Liaison as a member of our Executive Committee and
employing strategies to increase awareness and engagement with diversity opportunities. Considering the
growing understanding of the impact of nervous system injury on society, the well-established BITG program
plays an important role in training well-rounded future leaders in this area of research."

This is the second renewal application for a T32 grant, “Research Training in Biobehavioral
Disturbances of Eating Disorders.” The primary goal of this training program is to train
postdoctoral (MD, MD/PhD, and PhD) fellows for careers as independent researchers in Eating
Disorders. An intensive three-year program is outlined in which fellows learn how to identify
key research questions, formulate hypotheses, and design and execute experiments that
effectively test those hypotheses. In the course of training, fellows acquire a range of skills
relevant to research methodology, including expertise in experimental design and statistical
analysis relevant to clinical research. Graduating fellows are able to present research projects
clearly in both written and oral forms as evidenced by publications and presentations. The
training program outlined, utilizing the outstanding faculty at Columbia University offers a
unique opportunity to future researchers in the field of eating disorders. The Columbia Eating
Disorders Research Unit has a long track record of recruiting and successfully training clinical
researchers with its success reflected in high rates of its trainees receiving K awards and
pursuing full-time academic careers. Also, the Columbia program has been successful at
recruiting MD researchers into the field of eating disorders, making it an unusual training
program in this specialized area. Prior to the start of this T32 program in 2013, research fellows
specializing in eating disorders at Columbia used other, more general research training
programs available within the department. As these programs became more focused on basic
science and neurobiology, they grew reluctant to accept candidates with interests in the field of
eating disorders whose interests may have been more clinically, behaviorally, and
translationally focused. The T32 program for eating disorders research has gotten off to an
excellent start, offering a comprehensive clinical research education program, for outstanding
candidates interested in eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge
eating disorder. The NIMH has identified eating disorders as an understudied area in need of
research initiatives. This application outlines a training plan for future researchers in this
important clinical area."
10861748,"Researchers have challenged the notion of women’s health universality, an idea that essentializes women’s
health care needs regardless of their race/ethnicity, cultural background, age, social class, geographical
locations, and sexual identity (social determinants of health). These researchers subsequently assert the need
to consider the intersectionality of these multiple forms of discrimination in women’s health research. Intersecting
forms of social disadvantage and marginalization are frequently associated with adverse health outcomes.
Nurses, who have long been at the forefront of women’s health initiatives, are in an ideal position to participate
in and lead teams of researchers, health care providers, policymakers, and the lay public in a contemporary
commitment to strengthen women’s health. However, lack of significant training in data science (DS) and
emerging health information technologies (HIT) reduces the effectiveness of nursing scientists in women’s health
research. The use of DS and HIT can improve research effectiveness in reducing health disparities among
disadvantaged groups of women by providing various strategies that were not possible without these
methodologies (e.g., increasing access to hidden populations, improving the precision of measurements).
The purpose of this T32 program is to prepare nurse scientists who have knowledge and skills to employ DS
and/or HIT in order to improve women’s health while considering the intersectionality of multiple social
determinants of health. This is in agreement with the overarching goals of Healthy People 2030, the NINR
strategic plan (especially research lenses on health disparities and social determinants of health), the Trans-NIH
Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research, the IOM Report on Women’s Health Research, and the American
Academy of Nursing’s Women’s Health Research Agenda. This training will build on the strengths of the Emory
University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing’s currently funded research studies, faculty expertise, and
supporting infrastructure. It will address women’s health issues with a conceptual focus on intersectionality
among social determinants of health. Trainees will also develop knowledge and skills in interdisciplinary research
methods related to women’s health, understand and apply DS and/or HIT, and/or develop and test interventions
using DS and/or HIT in women’s health. The program comprises: 1) specific courses related to women’s health,
DS, and HIT; 2) electives to individualize training, develop an area of specialization, and facilitate trainees in
interdisciplinary courses; 3) biweekly T32 seminars to foster trainees’ integration of course content with other
program experiences; 4) 15 hours a week of work on faculty research over several semesters; 5) at least one
semester of individualized research practicum with center internships; and 6) participation in an interdisciplinary
center on campus that relates to the trainee’s research area. Fifteen nurse scientists will be trained over 5 years.
The program will engage 17 mentors and 6 Interdisciplinary co-mentors. Over 10 research
centers/institutes/departments have agreed to collaborate, making this a fully interdisciplinary training program."

Recognizing the critical need for a broad range of expertise in biomarker analysis at several levels of analysis,
we propose a unique postdoctoral training program titled “Training for the Multiscale and Multimodal Analysis of
Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease” (AD). USC is home to leading experts who utilize biomarkers in their work
investigating AD through a myriad of methods and analyses. Drawing from USC’s eminent resources and
expertise, this proposal will focus on preparing investigators for independent research careers in the multiscale
and multimodal analysis of biomarkers in AD, by integrating molecular and cellular methods, imaging tools and
informatics, quantitative methods for clinical trials research, and large-scale population analyses. Our proposed
training program draws preceptors and faculty from 12 schools, departments, institutes, and centers at USC,
fulfilling these methodological areas of expertise: USC Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics
Institute (INI) in the Keck School of Medicine (KSoM); Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute (ZNI) in the KSoM;
Department of Neurology in the KSoM; Department of Neurological Surgery in the KSoM; Department of
Radiology in KSoM; Alzheimer's Therapeutic Research Institute in the KSoM; Department of Population and
Public Health Sciences at the KSoM; Department of Economics in the Dana and David Dornsife College of
Letters, Arts and Sciences; Center for Economic and Social Research in the Dana and David Dornsife College
of Letters, Arts and Sciences; Institute for Technology and Medical Systems Innovation (ITEMS), a joint initiative
between Keck School of Medicine and Viterbi School of Engineering; Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health
Policy and Economics, a unique collaboration between the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy and School of
Pharmacy; and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. Trainees will complete coursework, lab rotations, and
career development activities, such as seminar series, instruction for problem solving, communication, time
management, and leadership skills, and instruction and training in grant writing. Trainees will become conversant
in all thematic areas and will be able to effectively collaborate outside of their own particular area of expertise.
Specifically, the USC Training for the Multiscale and Multimodal Analysis of Biomarkers in AD will aim to: equip
trainees with a combination of skills to conduct multiscale and multimodal analyses of biomarkers in AD by
providing tailored, didactic research education opportunities to further the research potential of trainees; facilitate
eminent research in the multiscale and multimodal analysis of biomarkers in AD by trainees, including the
development of research ideas, execution of research projects, and dissemination of research findings; establish
among trainees a collaborative and multidisciplinary team approach to advance research in the multiscale and
multimodal analysis of biomarkers in AD; and successfully transition trainees to independent research careers,
including securing their own research funding."

The urgency and importance of training critically needed basic, translational, and clinical scientists in women's
health and reproductive research is well recognized by the leadership of NIH, the national government, and the
scientific and medical communities. The UCSD Training Program in Reproductive Sciences takes a distinctive
multidisciplinary approach to training postdoctoral scholars as physician-scientists and reproductive biologists in
the mechanistic investigation of reproductive processes and diseases. The combination of clinical, physiological,
coputational, and molecular approaches to studying reproductive processes and disorders creates exceptional
training for basic scientists and physician-scientists, producing well-rounded reproductive researchers who are
extraordinarily qualified for future careers. The program supports both fellows seeking advanced research
experience post-Ph.D. and/or M.D., including those seeking research and clinical training to become board-
certified OB/GYN subspecialists. Thus, the leadership and mentor team are well balanced between clinical and
basic researchers. We have an exceptional 40-year track record as recognized by an NIH Mentor Award (10 yrs
2003-2012) and a perfect score of 10 awarded by the study section for the 2013-2018 application. Review panels
have approved 4 positions for many years, however, NICHD has funded only 3. We primarily support trainees
for their first research year, after which they seek F32 or K awards. A cohesive group of NIH-funded faculty from
the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences and the Departments of Medicine and
Pathology at UCSD with common interests, shared grants, and joint publications, provides basic, translational,
and clinical training, and fosters the careers of the trainees. The majority of the faculty are members of the UCSD
Center for Reproductive Science and Medicine, the Center for Perinatal Discovery, and/or mentors in the UCSD
Women's Reproductive Health Research Program. Thus, this training program is integrated with multiple centers,
allowing the faculty and fellows to interact at many levels, creating an atmosphere of collaboration, mentoring,
and career support. Our research ranges from computational and molecular to patient-oriented research utilizing
bioinformatics, in vitro analyses, cell culture models, whole animal, and clinical research methodology. The
breadth of the research opportunites for our trainees covers the lifspan: germ cells, placental growth and function,
gonadal physiology and development, pituitary/hypothalamic development and neurophysiology, puberty, pelvic
floor muscle biology, vaginal, urinary, and gut microbiome, metabolism and stress, and epidemiology of infertility
and preterm birth. The program of training includes group meetings and presentations, journal clubs, seminars,
national meetings, clinical and lab training, independent research, career development workshops, grant writing,
Independent Development Plans, and coursework in biostatistics, rigor and reproducibility, ethics, and an
innovative “Thesis Committee” team mentoring structure. Our aim is to continue to prepare exceptional
physician-scientists and basic scientists to become the future leaders in academic reproductive research."
10815751,"Abstract Summary
 Obesity and the associated metabolic complications including metabolic syndrome and diabetes significantly contribute
to cardiovascular morbidities. The overall goal of this proposal is aimed at identifying cellular mechanisms that link
activation of the G-protein coupled receptor 75 (GPR75) to obesity-driven metabolic and cardiovascular complications. In
the last funding period, we provided strong evidence that GPR75 is the receptor to which 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
(20-HETE), a vasoactive and pro-inflammatory lipid mediator, binds and through which it triggers its actions. 20-HETE
has been implicated in the development and progression of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases including hypertension,
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Our recent studies clearly demonstrated that 20-HETE-
mediates vascular dysfunction in hypertension and diet-driven metabolic (e.g., insulin resistance) and cardiovascular (e.g.,
hypertension) complications through its pairing and activation of GPR75. The adipose tissue and the vascular endothelium
are key to the ensuing cardiometabolic disorders in obesity. They both express GPR75 and are prime targets for 20-HETE
bioactions. In the endothelium, 20-HETE, through its binding to GPR75, uncouples eNOS, induces ACE and activates the
NF-κB inflammatory program. 20-HETE stimulates adipocyte hypertrophy and interferes with adipocyte insulin signaling,
glucose homeostasis and mitochondria function. Endothelial dysfunction in hypertensive subjects and obesity in humans
and animal models are accompanied by several fold increases in circulating 20-HETE levels. Accordingly, it is reasonable
to assume that 20-HETE through its actions on the vascular endothelium and adipose tissue acts as a significant determinant
of obesity-driven cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Importantly, in a large-scale exome sequencing of ~600,000
individuals, we revealed that loss of function GPR75 variants are associated with leanness and protection from obesity
(Science, 2021). This finding, which has been validated in Gpr75 null mice (Science, 2021 and Preliminary Results),
compellingly implicates the 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing in the pathogenesis of obesity and its cardiometabolic complications
and calls for identification of the underlying mechanisms. Consequently, we hypothesized that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
promotes diet-driven cardiometabolic complications (e.g., hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypertension) by a
mechanism that impairs endothelial and adipocyte function. We further argue that 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing
governs a crosstalk between adipocytes and endothelial cells which contributes to cardiovascular and metabolic
complications in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims that assess the contribution of endothelial-
and adipocyte-specific Gpr75 to diet-driven obesity and examine potential mechanisms governing endothelial-adipocyte
crosstalk that are dependent on 20-HETE-GPR75 pairing."

Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide. Microbial dysbiosis in the gut
and lungs has increasingly been associated with the incidence and severity of asthma, indicating the potential
of the microbiome to be a determinant factor in asthma pathogenesis. However, as the most likely connection
between the gut and lungs, the role of the blood microbiome in the “gut–lung axis” is still unclear for asthma
pathogenesis due to the lack of cost-effective and high-throughput sequencing methods. Indeed, it is either
impossible, or prohibitively expensive, for conventional sequencing methods to handle microbial DNA
samples that are in trace amounts, heavily degraded, or dominated by host DNA, e.g., in human blood. We
hypothesize that the presence of microorganisms in the blood is related to the risk of asthma occurrence,
and these microbial blood biomarkers can be captured by a reduced metagenomic sequencing method for
diagnosis or even early detection of asthma with the help of a deep learning framework. In this application, a
strain-resolved computational pipeline for the reduced metagenomic sequencing will be developed to profile
the blood microbiome in the “Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial” --- an ongoing randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 881 pregnant women with both questionnaires and maternal, cord,
and child blood samples available. Meanwhile, a deep-learning framework will be developed to optimize the
accuracy of diagnosis and prediction models for asthma using blood microbiome data. Finally, with the aid of
the new computational pipeline and deep-learning framework, the role of the blood microbiome in the gut–
lung axis and asthma pathogenesis will be investigated. Dr. Sun’s trainings in molecular biology,
bioinformatics and metagenomics have prepared him well for this proposed research. However,
understanding the molecular basis connecting asthma through the analysis of blood microbiome data is a
challenging task that requires further training in specific areas. Dr. Sun will leverage the excellent intellectual
environment of Harvard Medical School (HMS) and its teaching hospital Brigham and Women’s Hospital
(BWH). He will have access to extensive computational resources at BWH and HMS. Through formal
coursework and workshops, and with the help of a strong mentoring team and a world-class advisory
committee with complementary expertise, Dr. Sun will immerse himself in a training program focusing on
advanced programming, statistical modeling, deep learning, respiratory pathophysiology, and clinical
translation. Dr. Sun will meet with his two mentors and advisory committee members on a regular or needed
basis to present his progress and get prompt feedback and advice. Altogether, Dr. Sun’s training and research
plan will enable him to expand his current skill set to include the ability to address the challenges of low
microbial biomass sequencing in blood sample, deep learning in microbiome study and identifying the role of
blood microbes in asthma pathogenesis, and ultimately contribute to the precision medicine of lung diseases."

The purpose of this application is to continue the University of Vermont’s highly successful 30-year T32 training
program in the human behavioral pharmacology of drug use disorders. During the past 15 years, we trained 16
predoctoral and 22 postdoctoral fellows. Among those 38 fellows, all but two remain involved in research-related
careers. Twenty-five have completed the training phase of their careers. Among those 25, 14 (58%) have
primary university faculty/research-institute positions, six (24%) have been principal investigators (PI) on one
or more NIH research awards, seven (28%) are employed by government agencies, two (8%) work in industry,
and collectively they have more than 500 peer-reviewed publications on addiction. In addition to being a
productive training program, the training our fellows receive in human behavioral pharmacology fills a unique
niche in addiction research. Our fellows learn to identify basic behavioral and pharmacological processes
underpinning addiction and to translate that knowledge into effective clinical interventions and policy. We
propose to continue our emphasis on human behavioral pharmacology in the next funding period, continuing
our expansion into tobacco regulatory science and the impact of addictive behavior on health outcomes. Since
the last T32 renewal, we renewed our U54 Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science (TCORS) and P20 Center
of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) awards in behavior and health, and obtained a new UD9 Center
Award in Rural Addiction. These Centers add value to our training program via access to additional seminars,
guest lectures, interactions with additional fellows and guests, and new research and career opportunities.
Indeed, three of our T32 fellows have taken research scientist positions with FDA’s division on tobacco
regulation. We propose to continue supporting four predoctoral and four postdoctoral training slots with this T32
award. The eight members of the proposed training faculty consist of seven PhDs and one MD. These faculty
members are PIs on three NIH/HRSA center grants, five R01s, two R33/34s, two R21s, and one private-
foundation award creating a rich range of training opportunities in addiction research. All faculty and fellows are
located at a single, on-campus site composed of 8000 sq. ft of newly renovated space. Fellows are selected
based on scholastic excellence and commitment to a career in addiction research. Predoctoral fellows are
enrolled in the Department of Psychological Science PhD programs in experimental or clinical psychology
where they complete required coursework including those developed for this training program, and complete
master’s and doctoral theses. Postdoctoral fellows primarily focus on conducting and supervising independent
research, with additional opportunities to further their education via coursework. Each fellow has a primary
mentor from the training faculty. Fellows attend weekly seminars in addiction research and ethics. Additionally,
they present their research at two or more national scientific meetings annually. The training period is generally
4-5 years for predoctoral and 2-3 years for postdoctoral fellows. The overarching goal of the proposed training
program is to continue developing productive, independent, state-of-the-art addiction researchers."
10807019,"Project Summary
 Bilateral loss of vestibular sensation is disabling, with affected individuals suffering chronic disequilibrium,
increased risk of falls, and inability to maintain stable vision during head movements typical of daily life. While
most individuals with milder loss compensate through rehabilitative strategies enlisting other senses, those
with severe loss who fail to compensate have no good therapeutic options. When the vestibular nerves are
anatomically intact, as is true in most such cases, electrical stimuli encoding head rotation can drive nerve
activity and partially restore vestibular sensation, much as a cochlear implant partially restores auditory
sensation. In an on-going first-in-human early feasibility study of six adults disabled by bilateral vestibular
hypofunction after ototoxic hair cell injury, we found that vestibular implantation and motion-modulated
prosthetic stimulation targeting the implanted ear's three semicircular canals is a feasible, safe and effective
treatment for ototoxic loss, as evidenced by directionally-aligned vestibulo-ocular reflexes reliably elicited
during >3 years of continuous use, improvements in objective measures of posture and gait performance, and
improvement of patient-reported dizziness handicap and vestibular-related disability. On the strength of those
results, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has invited a request for humanitarian device
exemption for treatment of ototoxic loss; however, FDA advised that additional data would be required to
support expanding availability of this treatment to individuals with idiopathic loss, who make up the largest
proportion of bilateral vestibular hypofunction cases. Drawing on a well-established design, intact study team,
and protocol that yielded highly impactful results in the early feasibility study of subjects with ototoxic loss, the
proposed research program will extend this approach to adults disabled by idiopathic adult-onset bilateral
vestibular hypofunction. Results of this research are highly likely to yield broad, sustained impact, either
through support of early regulatory approval (if results of vestibular implantation for treatment of idiopathic loss
are as favorable as the results already obtained for ototoxic loss) or by providing the necessary foundational
data to support design of a subsequent, large-scale pivotal trial of vestibular implantation for idiopathic loss."
10812238,"ORIGINAL ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a period when many individuals begin to experiment with alcohol, with some progressing
rapidly to abusive drinking. The acute problems associated with heavy adolescent alcohol use (e.g.,
alcohol poisoning, sexual victimization, automobile accidents) have been well documented; less certain is
whether adolescent alcohol use also has long-term consequences. Three recent reviews of the relevant
literature have come to similar conclusions: adolescent drinking is associated with adult functioning, but
the existing literature does not tell us whether these associations are causal or whether the consequences
of adolescent drinking are long-lasting. We propose to address these limitations with a prospective study
of a unique cohort of twins. These twins were initially assessed at age 17, at the early stages of alcohol
use, and again at age 20, the period in adolescence when alcohol use peaks. They were subsequently
assessed at ages 24 and 29, a period characterized by life-role transition. We now propose to assess
them at mid-life (average age of 42 years), a developmental period characterized by stability and for most
a moderation of youthful patterns of heavy drinking. The in-person assessment will cover 4 major domains
of functioning: 1) mental health, including substance use and abuse, 2) physical health and behavior, 3)
neurocognitive function, and 4) psychosocial outcomes including educational and occupational
achievement and relationship quality. We estimate that 1130 twins will participate (greater than 90% of the
surviving members of the original cohort) in the in-person assessment and that 910 of their
spouses/partners will also complete a brief mail survey. Analysis of the data will document the range of
adult outcomes associated with adolescent drinking and evaluate three alternative models to account for
these effects: 1) the factors that lead to early and heavy drinking in adolescence also increase the
likelihood of deficits in adulthood (i.e., confounding), 2) adolescent heavy drinkers tend to become adult
heavy drinkers (i.e., drinking persistence), and 3) adolescent drinking upsets the normal course of adult.
The innovative cotwin control design, which controls for genetic and shared environmental factors on
outcomes, will help isolate possible causal effects of adolescent drinking on midlife functioning. The
extensive earlier assessments of this cohort will provide a wealth of information for propensity score

 The project follows a large cohort of twins from age 17 to age 36-44 to identify the consequences of
 heavy and abusive drinking in adolescence for functioning in mid-life. The project seeks to determine the
 extent to which adolescent drinking impacts mental health, physical health, cognitive and social
 functioning in mid-life and the extent to which any effects can be ameliorated by drinking desistence."

The primary goal of the MARC program at UC Santa Cruz is to recruit and prepare underrepresented
(UR) students for entry into biomedical PhD programs. This is initially achieved by increasing the rate at
which UR undergraduates become involved in cutting-edge research at our institution. An important
component of our MARC program is to create a larger community of UR and first-generation-in-college
students who identify as biomedical researchers and who help promote each other towards PhD-level
graduate training. Until this year, this community at UCSC included the 14 MARC scholars and the 23
undergraduates supported by the IMSD program. As the IMSD undergraduate program has ceased and
IMSD graduate training transitioned to a T32 program, we are requesting a total of 26 slots for the MARC
program to allow us to maintain the core of this larger community of undergraduate STEM Diversity
scientists. The aims of this training program proposal are to:
1 - develop a program for a larger MARC cohort of 26 students that fuses the strongest
components of our current MARC and IMSD programs. This program will incorporate recruitment,
rigorous laboratory training, placement with faculty, and professional development. The challenges will
be in how to scale up from the current 14 MARC trainees, however there are important lessons from the
success of our IMSD program. The director of that program, Prof. Melissa Jurica, has joined MARC as
co-PD so that best practices that she developed working with the larger IMSD undergraduate cohort can
be incorporated.
2 - ensure that 100% of graduating MARC fellows develop strong independent research skills.
We are approaching this challenge from two perspectives. First, we will develop a team approach to
ensure adequate measurable progress in student development of research independence. Second, we
will launch a program to have all students write an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)
application so that they can learn the skills of experimental design and grantsmanship.
3 - ensure that 100% of MARC fellows who are admitted into PhD programs are capable of
persisting through to completion. We are developing a program to prepare students for the new types
of social and professional challenges they will face in graduate school. MARC students will make contact
with our alumni mentor network and from them learn the social and professional challenges to anticipate
in their new environment. The members of the MARC fellow's mentoring team and alumni network will
remain available after graduation to provide them with personalized mentoring and coaching as needed."
10830953,"Adult brain angiogenesis is required for adaptation to low energy conditions e.g. hypoxia and ischemia, and for
recovery after brain injury. Decreased brain angiogenesis may cause brain ischemia, neurodegeneration, and
damage during aging while increased angiogenesis is linked to tumorigenesis including glioblastoma among
other pathologies. Thus, an understanding of the mechanisms regulating adult cerebral angiogenesis has both
basic neuroscience and clinical/translational importance to therapeutic vessel modulation for these diseases.
The present basic neuroscience project is designed to investigate a previously unrecognized mechanism for
brain angiogenesis regulation through a novel endogenous pro-angiogenic factor, adenylosuccinate (AdSucc).
Our preliminary studies have revealed that AdSucc has an important cellular signaling role in the brain rather
than functioning just as a metabolic intermediate metabolite. We demonstrated, for the first time, that AdSucc
activates angiogenesis in assays both in vitro and in vivo, and that AdSucc induces phospholipase C
dependent increase in cytoplasmic calcium, suggesting a receptor dependent action. Both of these effects
were activated under AdSucc endogenous concentrations found under low energy conditions in the brain,
which are conditions that require angiogenesis for long term compensation. Based on our preliminary data, our
central hypothesis is that AdSucc is a brain endogenous pro-angiogenic factor. Our long term objective is to
better understand metabolic regulation for brain angiogenesis, and determine if AdSucc is a valid therapeutic
target for treating conditions where aberrant angiogenesis is involved. To test our hypothesis, we have
established and characterized a novel AdSucc synthase (ADSS) conditional knockdown (KO) mouse model
that allows for spatial and temporal control of AdSucc attenuation. We have also established in our laboratory a
minimally invasive assay to quantify brain angiogenesis in a living animal in vivo using two photon microscopy.
Our central hypothesis will be tested via the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the role of AdSucc in brain
angiogenesis under chronic hypoxia. We will use brain vascular imaging in vivo to determine angiogenesis in
wild type and ADSS conditional KO mice under normoxia and chronic hypoxia, and confirm data with
histochemical and functional assays. 2. Determine the role of AdSucc in brain angiogenesis under normoxia.
In this aim, we will determine if AdSucc induces brain angiogenesis independently of oxygen availability.
Successful completion of these aims will test a novel mechanism for regulation of brain angiogenesis."

Episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) are associated with an increased risk for chronic kidney
disease (CKD); a permanent loss of kidney function. Following AKI, crosstalk between epithelial
and interstitial cells is critical for kidney healing (adaptive response) but if prolonged fosters CKD
(maladaptive). Evidence suggests that epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and microRNAs (miRs), can become deranged leading to pathological conditions. For
example, activation of kidney HDACs following AKI is hypothesized to exacerbate injury; however,
we and others have demonstrated that HDACs are also necessary for epithelial repair. A gap in
our knowledge exists in the kidney cell type specific, HDAC isoform-dependent mechanisms of
repair or chronic injury in response to AKI. We identified that following AKI, HDAC1 is significantly
increased in the kidney cortex including in fibroblasts and pericytes. Utilizing inducible, fibroblast-
specific HDAC1 knockout (KO) mice, we found that fibroblast/pericyte HDAC1 results in
myofibroblast activation and fibrosis. One potential target of HDAC1 may be miR-215-5p
(miR215). miR215 is reduced by in vivo HDAC inhibition, and is increased by HDAC1 in kidney
fibroblast/pericyte cells. We provide data that fibroblast miR215 is profibrotic. From these data,
we propose to test the following hypotheses: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that AKI-mediated
fibrosis is dependent on activation of fibroblast/pericyte cell HDAC1. Aim 2: To test the
hypothesis that AKI promotes miR215 dependent interstitial fibrosis in the kidney. The
experiments proposed in this R01 will provide deep molecular evidence of epigenetic regulation
of the kidney fibroblast/pericytes following AKI and we will determine the dynamic epigenetic
patterning during CKD transition. Using both biased and unbiased approaches will result in the
identification of novel pathways that likely be of therapeutic value to help attenuate AKI-CKD
transition."
10886501,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric disorders represent a leading cause of disability, affecting nearly 19% of the US population.
Only 9% of neuropsychiatric drugs entering clinical trials reach the market, which is one of the lowest success
rates across all therapeutic areas. Fundamental differences between the neurobiology of rodents and humans
have been proposed to account for translational failures in development of effective therapeutic strategies to
mitigate neurological or neurodegenerative diseases or disorders. Rodent behavioral assays are also variably
effective in predicting clinically effective neuropsychiatric drugs. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are recognized as
a valuable, clinically relevant alternative to span the gap between rodents and humans in the development of
therapies designed to advance brain health. Among NHPs, the common marmoset [Callithrix jacchus (cj)] affords
a highly tractable option because of its small size, short lifespan, production of multiple offspring/year and
accurate recapitulation of human neuroanatomy. However, the ultimate utility of the marmoset model remains in
its infancy due to the paucity of efficient tools to facilitate studies requiring genetic modification, especially those
needed to recapitulate complex aspects of brain health. To address this urgent need, we propose an innovative,
more efficient approach to achieve gene editing and transgenesis in marmosets based on the novel use of highly
manipulable induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated to form male germ cells that can
ultimately be used to produce transgenic offspring carrying precisely edited alleles of genes relevant to brain
health and disease. Specifically, we will combine 1) close proximity to one of two NIH-designated Marmoset
Breeding Colonies, maintained at the Southwest National Primate Research Center, 2) experience with NHP
pluripotent stem cells, iPSC derivation, and CRISPR/Cas9 editing, 3) a novel strategy to produce transplantable
male germ cells from edited cjiPSCs, 4) documented expertise transplanting NHP germ cells into testes to
produce sperm, 5) published experience in the use of cutting-edge single-cell genomics and multiparametric
integrative epigenomics to assess normality of any cell type, and 6) leading expertise in brain health and disease
in general and the neurogenetics of epilepsy in particular. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR editing to generate
mutant ARX alleles and reporter transgenes in cjiPSCs. In Aim 2, we will optimize derivation and transplantation
of male cjiPSC-derived germ cells into recipient testes and grafts to foster development of transgenic sperm. In
Aim 3, we will assess the impact of ARX mutations on marmoset cortical neuron development and migration.
Together, these aims are designed to advance the utility of the marmoset model for brain research based on
CRISPR/Cas9 editing of cjiPSCs, male germline-mediated transgenesis, development of cjiPSC-derived brain
organoids, and specific knowledge of the neurological impact of ARX mutations."

Vanderbilt Antibody and Antigen Discovery for Clostridioides difficile Vaccines VANDy-CdV
Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is the leading cause of hospital-
acquired gastrointestinal infection in the United States. The rising incidence of community-
acquired C. difficile infection (CDI) in otherwise healthy adults is linked to increased antibiotic use
and the emergence of new strains. CDI symptoms and pathology are mediated by two large
homologous toxins, TcdA and TcdB, and therefore the toxins represent attractive targets for
prevention and therapeutic strategies. While efforts centered around the use of toxoids for
immunization have shown promise in reducing the severity of symptoms, the toxoid approach has
not resulted in a decreased incidence of CDI in clinical trials. There are several opportunities to
improve upon existing vaccine strategies. First, large scale genomic studies show that TcdB is
undergoing rapid evolutionary change; the identification of conserved toxin epitopes can be used
to direct the immune response toward the production of broadly neutralizing responses. Second,
the identification of conserved antigens on the surface of the vegetative bacteria or spores that
can serve as immunogens will allow the host to elicit mucosal immune responses that prevent
bacterial colonization. The inclusion of mucosal immunization routes is expected to further
enhance vaccine efficacy and durability. The overarching goal of the VANDy-CdV program is to
identify toxin subunits and novel cell surface antigens that, when combined, promote durable
protection against C. difficile infection and symptoms. Among many innovative strengths, the
approach includes the use of human CDI patient samples as a resource for understanding what
antigens promote IgG, IgA, and sIgA responses in natural infection. The approach also includes
the use of powerful single B cell sorting and sequencing methods. The ability to identify paired
heavy and light chain sequences from individual memory B cells binding toxins and/or bacteria
allows for the production of unique antibodies that can then be used as tools for epitope mapping
and novel antigen discovery. A third highlight of the approach involves the use of a newly created
C. difficile transposon library which will be used to identify novel antigens in an in vivo
vaccination/challenge experiment. Other innovations include a structure-guided approach to
identifying potent, neutralizing epitopes and a systematic evaluation of how intestinal lymphocyte
responses vary with routes of immunization. Vaccine efficacy and the mucosal correlates of
protection will be evaluated in pre-clinical models of colonization, infection, and recurrence. At the
end of five years, we expect to have the pre-clinical data needed to advance a novel antigen
cocktail and immunization strategy forward into human safety and efficacy trials."
10800714,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Administrative Core for the Vanderbilt Antibody and Antigen Discovery for Clostridioides difficile
Vaccines (VANDy-CdV) program will serve to integrate and facilitate the broad range of activities that will be
undertaken within the program. This core will benefit from considerable administrative leadership experience
among the team members as well as strong institutional support. Four specific aims/responsibilities are
proposed. The first aim will be to coordinate program activities. The success of VANDy-CdV will depend on
frequent and meaningful interactions between all investigators. A Local Steering Committee composed of project
leaders, core directors, and key personnel will meet monthly to monitor progress, guide scientific directions, and
to monitor finance- and compliance-related issues. In addition, a full team meeting will occur quarterly to foster
productive and collaborative research. All VANDy-CdV members will be invited to share progress and solicit
constructive feedback. The Administrative Core will plan, coordinate, and document the activities from these
meetings. The second aim will be to interface with NIAID Program Officers and ensure that NIH reporting
requirements are met. In addition to official reporting requirements, the Administrative Core will notify the NIH of
all VANDy-CdV monthly and quarterly meetings. The Core will generate reports following each meeting and
distribute these reports to Local Steering Committee leaders and NIAID Program Officers. The Administrative
Core will also coordinate travel for VANDy-CdV members to attend and participate in Annual Programmatic
Meetings. The third aim is to provide fiscal oversight. Vanderbilt University Medical Center is ultimately
responsible for all spending decisions involving VANDy-CdV; however, the initial level of fiscal oversight will be
the responsibility of the Administrative Core. The fourth aim is to manage intellectual property, resource and
reagent distribution, and transmittal of data to public databases. Opportunities relating to intellectual property
across the projects and cores will be handled by the Administrative Core in conjunction with the Vanderbilt Center
for Commercialization and Technology Transfer (CTTC). The Administrative Core also will ensure that all
reasonable requests for reagents from any VANDy-CdV program are satisfied within a timely manner."
10800716,"Project Summary- CORE 1
 Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the United
States and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with CDI have high rates of recurrence
of disease, with 20-30% of adults and children having additional infections. Evaluation of the immune response
to CDI has focused primarily on the antibody response to CDI toxins. Unfortunately, CDI therapeutics and
toxoid vaccines focused primarily on the immune response to toxins have produced disappointing results in
CDI prevention to date.
 Additional evaluation of the host immune response to CDI is critical and best evaluated through basic and
translational research as outlined in the Vanderbilt Antibody and Antigen Discovery for Clostridioides difficile
Vaccines (VANDy-CdV) project. The Clinical Data and Biospecimen Repository Core (Core 1) will support the
goals of the VANDy-CdV through a rich source of patient biospecimens and linked clinical data. Core 1 will be
responsible for all elements of patient recruitment, enrollment, biospecimen collection, database integration,
and patient retention. Trained research personnel will identify patients with CDI at a large tertiary care medical
center through clinical microbiology laboratory records which process over 450 samples for C. difficile testing
per month. After consent, residual stool samples will be obtained. At two weeks and two months after CDI,
serum, whole blood, and saliva will be obtained. Clinical data and CDI-related outcomes will be measured at
two weeks, two months, and six months after initial infection. Core 1 will enroll 40 CDI case patients identified
through laboratory records and an additional 40 healthy controls recruited through primary care clinics. Core 1
will process, aliquot, and log all biospecimens for future use to support the aims of the VANDy-CdV team. Core
1 will also establish and maintain a repository of clinical data elements pre-determined to be essential to the
aims of the VANDy-CdV project. De-identified data with linked biospecimens will be provided to VANDy-CdV
members through a standardized and tracked approach. The end result of these efforts will be a carefully
curated and maintained database of clinical data and biospecimens that will directly support the efforts of the
VANDy-CdV team to investigate the critical role of host immunity in patients with CDI."
10892778,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over 230 million people undergo surgery annually. The experience of postsurgical pain varies among
individuals, but a significant proportion (20-30%) of patients experience surgical site pain lasting at least a year
postoperatively. Such Persistent Post-Surgical Pain (PPSP) causes physical and mental suffering and
disability and lengthens exposure to opioid analgesics, potentially placing patients at risk of addiction. Despite
excellent research in basic research indicating potential mechanisms involved in the transition of acute to
chronic pain, little success at translating these findings to actual prevention of persistent postoperative pain in
human patients has been realized. My research program has developed a working human model of this
transition, by systematic and longitudinal studying pain before, during and after a variety of surgeries. We have
identified several patient-level risk factors that predict who is high-risk for developing PPSP, allowing more
efficient study of this problem, as well as insight into relevant mechanisms, in humans.
 A crucially important factor in determining the trajectory of PPSP appears to be the tendency for the
pain signal to be amplified. While pain amplification may be protective in the short term, it becomes
dysfunctional if excessive or persistent. In our psychophysics lab, we study measures that indicate excessive
amplification response of the nervous system in some individuals in response to standardized pain testing. We
also measure psychosocial factors such as stress, sleep disruption, and catastrophizing (a mental process by
which rumination, magnification, and worry increase salience and importance), which can also amplify the pain
signal. Importantly, pain amplification is more prominent in some individuals, and accounts for a sizeable
amount of the variation in pain resulting from surgery (and far more than the surgical extent). We have
developed a system to easily and non-invasively test this “amplification phenotype” in individuals BEFORE
surgery, using modified bedside quantitative sensory tests, and brief, validated psychosocial questionnaires.
 My research program has optimized measurement of our patients’ preoperative amplification
phenotype, to help target both known and novel non-opioid preventive treatments to these high-risk individuals.
Our goals for the next 5 years of this R35 award are: (1) to efficiently target the prevention of persistent pain
and opioid use after surgery in high-risk individuals, (2) to understand and target the underlying mechanisms
contributing to the development of PPSP, including understanding how pain amplification relates to the
inflammatory response to surgery, (3) to more widely apply preventive strategies, understanding their
differential efficacy among diverse samples of patients. As an Anesthesiologist with formal training in pain
neuroscience, psychophysical and psychosocial assessments, and practical experience in conducting
translational studies, I am well-situated to conduct such well-designed mechanistic studies."

The Biostatistics Core provides centralized and state-of-the-art support to meet the data management and
analytic needs of the Program Project Grant. Core personnel have the necessary expertise in statistics to
optimize the quantitative demands of the aims outlined in each project. Core centralization fosters bonds and
communication between project leaders and statisticians, and facilitates matching of investigators with the most
appropriate quantitative collaborators. In addition, centralizing this resource ideally positions the Core to initiate
and promote interdisciplinary interactions among projects, and thus contributes to accelerating the bi -directional
exchange between basic and translational science. Core personnel can also help investigators design new
studies and test new hypotheses that may arise by cross-fertilization among related projects. The Core will be
staffed by two statisticians, Dr. Hong Li (Core Leader) and Mr. Kent Armeson. Core biostatisticians are housed
in the Biostatistics Shared Resource in the Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) at the Medical University of South
Carolina (MUSC), an active and committed group of biostatistics faculty members broadly skilled in statistical
methods in oncology research. By situating key Core personnel in MUSC’s HCC, all projects are guaranteed
access to a robust tool kit to support quantitative needs. All Projects require support with respect to: experimental
study design, including power analysis and sample size justification ; data collection, storage, and analysis;
interpretation of output from complex statistical methods; and abstract and manuscript preparation. By providing
research expertise and logistical support to the quantitative needs of each project, the Biostatistic s Core will
contribute to professional, efficient and rigorous procedures for the generation, analysis and interpretation of
data, which will be critical to the success of the Program Project Grant."

 Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding,
assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We
propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building
health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning
and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address
NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical
research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas
including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and
intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in
the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies
through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with
automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early-
career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate
students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional
multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to
the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating
youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome
research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource-
limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple
information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable
explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the-
loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance.
Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its
influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD
interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed
contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a
person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been
investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of
researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs
in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs."
10830416,"ABSTRACT
Significant morbidity and health care costs are associated with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Mycoplasma
genitalium (MG) infections. Each is associated with male and female reproductive tract syndromes, yet each
presents unique challenges for control. CT is the most commonly reported nationally notifiable condition in the
US and is a known cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility. Despite longstanding control
programs, CT rates are at an all-time high and the utility and cost-effectiveness of CT prevention efforts are
debated. As most CT infections are asymptomatic, our current understanding of the epidemiology and the
effectiveness of CT control programs has depended entirely on case detection through screening, which is only
targeted to select populations (women <25 years and other high risk persons). Much less is known about CT in
women ≥25 who are infrequently screened, and screening is not recommended for men who have sex with
women (MSW). These major gaps in our understanding have limited our ability to effectively target CT prevention
programs to men and women at highest risk of infection. MG is a more recently emerged pathogen, responsible
for 20-30% of male urethritis. There is no national MG surveillance and, despite general agreement that MG
causes male urethritis, there is no consensus about whether it causes sequelae in women. Limited population
based estimates of urogenital MG prevalence exist, yet prevalent infections are often a poor predictor of lifetime
experience of PID and infertility and permit only partial understanding of population-level epidemiology.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in MG is rapidly expanding - MG is one of three bacteria on the CDC's 2019
Watch List of AMR threats - but AMR prevalence estimates are derived from high-risk STD clinic populations
and there are no nationally representative data. A better understanding of the population-level epidemiology of
CT and MG is critical to improving control efforts for each. To achieve this, we will conduct a seroepidemiologic
study in the National Health and Nutrition Examinations Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 cycle, using a novel
serologic assay for CT that differentiates IgG isotypes to distinguish recent from distant infection, and a more
sensitive and specific seroassay for MG. We will also identify AMR in urine specimens from MG-positive persons
in NHANES 2017-2018. Finally, we will develop an individual-based CT and MG transmission dynamics model.
Using these outputs, we will (1) estimate the lifetime prevalence of CT in US men and characterize factors
associated with recent versus past infection among men and women; (2) estimate the seroprevalence and
correlates of MG infection in US men and women, determine the association between prior MG infection and
self-reported PID and infertility, and estimate prevalence and correlates of macrolide and quinolone resistance
in MG; (3) evaluate the impact of CT and MG screening scenarios on reproductive health and treatment
outcomes in mathematical models. These data will provide critical information to either support or change current
CT screening guidelines, and to inform nascent national testing and treatment recommendations for MG."

This study will investigate the epidemiology, clinical implications, and immunologic and infectious determinants
of aging-related diseases and outcomes in older people with HIV (PWH) in Brazil. In part a result of the long-
term effects of HIV infection and ongoing inflammation, older PWH experience high rates of non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) and early onset of geriatric syndromes including frailty, disability, and cognitive decline.
However, HIV is not alone as a chronic infection that can cause inflammation and other immunological
changes associated with these outcomes. Our knowledge of how other chronic infections endemic to low-and
middle-income countries affect the pathogenesis and epidemiology of geriatric syndromes in is lacking. A
middle-income country with a large population of older PWH, Brazil has a history of comprehensive HIV care
as well as endemic chronic infections. This diverse, longitudinal study will recruit PWH on antiretroviral therapy
≥50 years of age in three Brazilian cities (n=360 ages 50-64years and n=340 ages ≥65 years) to evaluate the
ways coinfections such as TB, HTLV-1, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and others affect the epidemiology
and immunologic pathways of aging-related morbidity. We will examine the association of syndemics of
coinfections and social determinants of health with validated NCDs. We will prospectively evaluate how
individual and cumulative burden of coinfections predict incident geriatric syndromes. We will evaluate a novel
screening tool to assess vulnerability of older PWH for adverse clinical outcomes including death,
hospitalization, and new disability. This study will also investigate how coinfections affect biologic pathways of
inflammation which contribute to development of NDCs and geriatric syndromes Building upon established and
productive collaborations in HIV observational research in Latin America, this study is uniquely positioned to
provide urgently needed, high-quality data to understand aging with HIV in a global context. It will offer novel
insights into a diversity of infectious contributions to cellular mechanisms of aging experienced by PWH around
the globe."

The application for Xavier University of Louisiana's Mobile Outreach for Laboratory Enrichment (XULA-
MOLE) proposes a comprehensive training and mentoring program for high school students and
teachers. This project is a partnership between Xavier and participating local high schools. The long-term
objective of this collaboration is to stimulate science interest in high school students in the New Orleans
area as a precursor to them pursuing careers in the biomedical sciences or STEM fields. The XULA-
MOLE project also aims to better support science teachers with pedagogical and research project design
training and mentoring to increase their impact in the classroom. The introduction of mobile inquiry-based
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) centered laboratory experiences will
encourage high school students in this resource poor setting to pursue further education and careers in
scientific fields. This program is especially important to the New Orleans area high schools, which after
Hurricane Katrina have struggled to find synergy between curriculum design and education reform
implementation. The general strategy for this proposed work will be carried out via a four-pronged
approach involving (i) inquiry-based laboratory experiences, (ii) professional development and research
design training for teachers, (iii) establishing near-peer mentoring programs between Xavier
undergraduates and their pre-college peers and (iv) high school field trips to biomedical research labs at
Xavier. The XULA-MOLE project participants include Xavier faculty and undergraduate STEM students
who will design inquiry-based guided laboratory modules for the participating high schools aligned to the
NGSS science processes. The specific activities for XULA-MOLE will be designed with inspiration from
previous SEPA-funded programs such as BEST Science!, which focused on professional development
workshops for teachers, and the long-sustaining CityLab, which most recently is piloting an after school
science education program impacting students' science identity.
By using a multi-pronged strategy to inspire science teaching and learning, the XULA-MOLE Program
aims to develop a model system that can be applied to multiple schools and grade levels."

 Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is the most common form of hereditary ataxia, affecting ~1 in every 50,000 people
in the US. FA is an autosomal recessive condition caused by the inheritance of a GAA trinucleotide repeat
expansions in the frataxin (FXN) gene, which results in reduced levels of FXN in mitochondria. Clinical
manifestations appear between the ages of 8 and 16 as a multisystem disorder, primarily affecting cardiac and
nervous system. FA is steadily progressive and is characterized by diminished quality of life (QOL) and
premature death, usually caused by ventricular arrhythmia. There is currently no effective treatment.
 Gene replacement using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV) carrying the human FXN gene
is a promising therapeutic strategy for FA as shown by our group and others. Our group has conducted
toxicology and biodistribution studies in support of the first-in-human gene therapy study for the treatment of
FA. The IND will be submitted in 2020 Q2 and we expect to enroll the first patient immediately after approval.
 However, a critical unresolved challenge for the success of gene therapy is the host immune response to
the vector capsid. Administration of rAAV vectors carrying a transgene elicits cellular and adaptive immune
responses against the vector capsid. Exaggerated immune responses can lead to safety concerns and impact
longevity of expression, as well as contribute to loss of the therapeutic effect. In addition, preclinical data from
our lab and others suggest that prior natural exposure to AAV (pre-existing immunity), can lead to severe
infusion reactions and diminished therapeutic efficacy with subsequent AAV exposure. Current AAV-mediated
gene therapy trials must consider a single exposure to the therapeutic vector at a dose below the toxic level
and exclude subjects with pre-existing AAV immunity. Our hypothesis is that a more effective dose could be
achieved safely by incremental dosing of AAV with multiple lower AAV doses over time. Our extensive
preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that B-cell depletion with rituximab and sirolimus in association with
AAV delivery prevents formation of antibodies and confirm our hypothesis. However, prolonged use of
rituximab has been associated with rare but devastating adverse events. In this U01 application, we propose to
improve the overall efficacy and safety of the planned FA gene therapy program by identifying an optimal
immunomodulation regimen to prevent immune responses against the AAV capsid, which will allow for safe
repeated administration of AAV (Aim 1) and therapeutic AAV administration in subjects’ with pre-existing
immunity (Aim 2). We anticipate that the proposed studies will have a major impact on the application of gene
therapy approaches not only for FA, but for a wide array of neuromuscular genetic disorders."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are an emerging epidemic in the United States (U.S.).
Black and Hispanic men and women are particularly vulnerable to ADRD. Without effective prevention
strategies to target and optimize resilience to ADRD, 14 million U.S. adults will be living with ADRD by 2060,
with an associated financial burden of $511 billion by 2040. While physical activity has been consistently
identified as a modifiable, protective factor to prevent cognitive decline and delay age of dementia onset, the
majority of this evidence is based on reported estimates of leisure-time moderate to vigorous intensity physical
activity (MVPA), which provides an incomplete characterization of this complex behavioral phenotype.
Approximately 95% of waking hours are spent sedentary or in light intensity physical activity; however, there is
limited research exploring the health impacts of these different intensity categories. Also, less than 10% of
adults accumulate sufficient MVPA to meet recommendations, and this prevalence is even lower in minority
groups. Studies have also demonstrated that sleep disturbances, particularly sleep duration and sleep-
disordered breathing may increase risk of cognitive impairment. However, this body of evidence is still
emerging. Further, Black and Hispanic adults have a higher prevalence of disordered sleep compared to
Whites. Despite the potential importance of both waking and sleep behaviors to optimize cognitive resilience,
their impacts are often studied in isolation. To address these critical research gaps, we propose the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 24-Hour Activity Cycle Study (MESA 24H-ACT), a four-year ancillary study to
MESA. The overall goal of the MESA 24H-ACT Study is to quantify the impact of physical activity and sleep via
the 24-hour movement paradigm to preserve cognitive function and prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Participants
who meet eligibility criteria and agree to participate (estimated n=2,125) will be included. As part of MESA
24H-ACT, we propose to augment MESA with a 7-day accelerometer and sleep actigraphy protocol to
objectively measure the 24-hour activity cycle (sedentary behavior, light intensity physical activity, MVPA, and
sleep). To accomplish these goals, this study will examine the associations of 24-hour activity cycle behaviors,
ascertained via device-based measures, cross-sectionally with cognition; markers of cerebrovascular disease,
neurodegeneration, and amyloid burden; and the prevalence of MCI and dementia (AIM 1); examine self-
reported 24-hour activity cycle behaviors with prospective changes in global cognitive function,
cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration (AIM 2); and elucidate the bidirectional relationship between
impaired cognitive function and 24-hour activity cycles over 12 years. MESA 24H-ACT will address current
evidence gaps and provide empirical evidence to accelerate a paradigm shift towards an integrated model that
incorporates all 24-hour movement behaviors to optimize brain health across racially/ethnically diverse
populations."

This T32 proposal will establish an innovative transdisciplinary postdoctoral training program focusing on
transdiagnostic, neurodevelopmental mechanisms of psychopathology, with an expanded focus on
developmental and environmental influences - program title: Northwestern University Mental Health, Earlier:
Transdiagnostic, Transdisciplinary, Translational Training Program in Neurodevelopmental Mechanisms
of Psychopathology (NU-MHE). Specifying malleable neurodevelopmental mechanisms of psychopathology at
key developmental inflection points has proven elusive, suggesting that innovative methods and frameworks are
necessary in order to advance intervention and prevention efforts. Approaches like NIMH’s Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) initiative, frame mental disorders as neurodevelopmental phenomena which emerge during an
unfolding sequence from vulnerability to clinical symptomatology. This has led to novel research heuristics and
designs which move away from conventional, discrete disease-based models towards more multi-level,
transdiagnostic, transdisciplinary, approaches. However, the field is lacking training paradigms that effectively
capture this dynamic, multi-faceted nature. This T32 thus proposes a novel training paradigm that bridges
research in neurodevelopmental mechanisms of mental disorder with adjacent domains of high translational
significance. Fellows will develop expertise in neurodevelopmental mechanisms of psychopathology, taking into
account developmental and environmental contexts. Additionally, fellows will acquire foundational knowledge in
the following core competencies: (1) computational psychiatry and other data science applications to mental
health, (2) intervention/prevention/implementation science, (3) intersection of mental health and pediatric
physical conditions – as well as the following professional development competencies, (4) translational team
science, (5) ethical and responsible conduct of clinical research (which includes attentiveness to diversity), (6)
grantsmanship, supporting a K or R-level grant submission, and (7) leadership and other career development
skills. To achieve these competencies, at least 85% of the fellows’ time will be spent in mentored independent
research. All fellows will have two co-mentors: A co-mentor with expertise in neurodevelopmental mechanisms
of psychopathology; and a co-mentor in one of the following areas: (a) prevention, intervention, or
implementation, (b) computational psychiatry and data science, or (c) the intersection of mental and pediatric
health. These research experiences will be complemented by seminars in neurodevelopmental mechanisms of
psychopathology, data science/computational psychiatry, as well as experiential learning (e.g., research in the
context of real world care). Fellows will also make use of the rich educational resources available at NU, including
professional development training in grant writing, team science skills, mentoring others, rigor and reproducibility,
and other resources dedicated to career development. NU-MHE is well-positioned to launch the next generation
of neurodevelopmental clinical scientists and leaders poised to accelerate the pace of clinical translation."
10854934,"Project Summary
Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a disorder of adolescence and young adulthood with a poor prognosis.
Patients with medical instability and malnutrition are hospitalized to begin nutritional rehabilitation, or “refeeding”.
Despite long hospitalizations, ~45% of patients are readmitted and only 18-55% recover in one year. Further,
AN has the highest mortality of all psychiatric disorders (5.1%), similar to childhood cancers. These challenges
make eating disorders a “common and costly” pediatric diagnosis 15. The overall goal of our research program
is to improve these outcomes through novel approaches to refeeding. Our early work showed that the decades-
old lower calorie refeeding approach was overly cautious and contributed to poor weight gain and protracted
hospital stay. We developed and tested a Higher Calorie Refeeding (HCR) approach in preliminary studies
showing improved outcomes with no apparent increase in risk. Clinical practice was eager to adopt HCR, an
RCT was imperative. Our parent trial, StRONG, was the largest and only RCT of refeeding in the U.S.
(R01HD082166; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02488109). HCR restored medical stability 3.0 days earlier, with no
increase in electrolyte abnormalities, and saved ~$20,000 in charges/participant.
Proposed project: Since we began this research, “atypical” AN (AAN) was recognized as a new diagnosis
describing AN at normal weight. This rapidly growing patient population comprised 42% our StRONG cohort. At
baseline, they were equally malnourished and medically unstable as AN. The major finding motivating the
proposed trial is that participants with AAN gained weight 40% slower and required >2 additional days
in hospital to restore medical stability on HCR, as compared to AN. These signs of underfeeding were due
to a suboptimal caloric “dose”. We have developed an Individualized Caloric Refeeding (ICR), which doses
calories to weight consistent with other pediatric treatments (e.g. medication).
Purpose, hypotheses and design: The primary purpose of the proposed trial (AIMs 1&2) is to compare the
efficacy and safety of ICR to the new standard of care (HCR) in hospitalized patients with AAN. We hypothesize
that ICR will restore medical stability faster than HCR with no increase in electrolyte abnormalities. After
hospitalization, there is no consensus on clinical remission in AAN and controversy over whether these formerly
overweight patients should gain weight to recover. We will examine metabolic, hormonal and psychological
markers over 12 mo. (AIM 3), toward the goal of developing a definition of clinical remission in AAN. Based on
our finding that Weight Suppression (WS) was a significant predictor of illness severity in AAN at admission,
we hypothesize that WS during follow-up represents incomplete recovery from AAN. Design: RCT in N=74
patients with AAN, age 12-24 years, consented upon hospital admission, randomly assigned to ICR or HCR, and
followed daily in hospital and at 3,6,9 and 12 mo. Significance: AAN is a rapidly growing diverse patient
population in urgent need of individualized treatment approaches and recovery goals."
10881656,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death among veterans, and the Veterans Health Administration
estimates that there exist >170,000 cancer patients within in the VA system. Moreover, approximately 50,000
new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year. With the aging of the veteran population, this number is expected
to increase causing a concomitant encumbering of healthcare resources. Lung cancer, which is the leading
cause of death in both men and women in industrialized countries (an estimated 28% of all cancer deaths in the
USA), is also the leading cause of cancer death in the veteran population. Indeed, many veterans continue to
acquire tobacco addiction during their military service even though tobacco abuse is currently discouraged by
the military. Hence, there exists a very large percentage of high-risk current and former smokers cared for in the
VA health care system that would benefit from advances in therapeutic molecular targeting in the treatment of
lung cancer. Also, lung cancer is also linked to the well-established lung carcinogens, Agent Orange, Asbestos,
and Ionizing Radiation, which exposure to these agents are often are service-connected disorders.
 To address this issue, the research of the Chalfant Laboratory focuses on non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), which represents the majority of lung cancers, carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of less
than 12 months, and has a cumulative five-year survival rate of approximately 15%. The research of the Chalfant
Laboratory is tailored to identify new cellular targets for the development of new treatments for this deadly
disease, which are thus, directly relevant to the patient care mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Indeed, biomedical research investigating new strategies for the development of lung cancer therapeutics has
tremendous potential benefit to veterans, many of whom no longer smoke, yet remain at high risk for NSCLC.
 The Chalfant Laboratory focuses on two major, but diverse areas of basic science in regard to Cell
Biology, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology. Specifically, the Chalfant Laboratory studies mechanisms of cell
signaling associated with both bioactive lipids and RNA splicing with a focus on both basic science mechanisms
as well as in many cases clinical translation. In regard to RNA splicing research, the Chalfant Laboratory has
identified key RNA splicing events and signaling mechanisms mediating the tumor maintenance of NSCLC cells.
The applicant is further merging these finding with novel lipid signaling events linked to cell survival.
 The applicant, Dr. Chalfant, has been very productive with >100 peer-reviewed publications, and he has
been a distinguished member of the VA system for 17 years. His research work is supported by several NIH/VA
funded projects and currently, he has one VA Merit Review award and three NIH funded projects (2-R01 and 1-
U01). He has trained more than 40 trainees at very levels with a number of them currently faculty members at
various institutions with funded research programs. The applicant is an unselfish mentor of young investigators
allowing them to act as co-corresponding authors on numerous publications for the betterment of their careers.
The applicant continues to be a leader in his scientific field as shown by appointments to several Editorial Boards
and National Committees, which include: the editorial boards of the Journal of Lipid Research. Molecular Cancer
Research, and the Journal of Biological Chemistry, formal membership on the Cancer and Molecular
Pathobiology Study Section of the National Institutes of Health, and formal membership on the Oncology A Study
Section of the Veterans’ Administration. These areas of research also led to the communication of the 2011
ASBMB Avanti Junior Investigator Award for Lipid Research to Dr. Chalfant. The applicant has also extensively
collaborated with numerous investigators in funded program projects and scientific publications.
 In summary, the applicant’s scientific contributions are vitally important to the VA mission. He has made
ground breaking discoveries in the field of NSCLC, RNA Splicing, Lipidomics, and Lipid Signaling and has also
provided significant resources to the scientific community and the VA system."
10833557,"Influenza A viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family, and have a negative-sense, segmented RNA
genome, which can cause seasonal or pandemic flu with high morbidity and significant mortality.
Vaccination is the most prevalent prophylactic means for controlling influenza infections. However, an
effective vaccine usually takes at least six months to develop. Furthermore, vaccination has limited
effectiveness in the treatment of immunocompromised patients, and its effectiveness is also limited
during a pandemic. The current therapeutic options for flu infections are all based on the neuraminidase
inhibitors (NAIs; oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir), while the influenza M2 ion channel blockers
(amantadine and rimantadine) are not now recommended since all of the circulating influenza strains
have acquired resistance. (Xofluza, a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor, has just been approved
in 2018 and is yet untried during a flu season.) The rapid emergence of the NAI-resistant strains of
influenza A viruses strongly suggests that NAIs alone may not be sufficient as effective therapies, and
thus new treatment options targeting the other viral/host factors are urgently needed. This application
defines a plan to develop potent, small molecule inhibitors, which block entry of influenza A viruses. We
have identified compounds that inhibit entry of infectious influenza A viruses, with IC50 values in the
nanomolar range. We have synthesized structurally diverse analogs of the anti-influenza hit series using
structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve potency and selectivity; validated the lead inhibitor
candidates in the infectious assay and investigated the mechanism of action (MOA) of the these
inhibitors; and selected anti-influenza inhibitors with excellent in vitro potency and selectivity values and
druglike in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. In this Fast Track STTR Phase I &II application, we propose
four specific aims: (1) optimize the lead scaffold and select development candidates; (2) investigate the
mechanism of action (MOA) of the advanced lead compounds with HA proteins; (3) evaluate the
pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics of the advanced lead compounds; and (4) preclinical development."
10847355,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of healthcare-acquired infections worldwide. Many globally-
distributed high-risk strains are emerging due to an increase in antibiotic resistance and acquisition of novel
virulence traits. With diminishing treatment options for many of these severe P. aeruginosa infections, studies
aimed at uncovering the virulence strategies used by these aggressive clinical strains should help to identify new
targets for therapeutic intervention. Our research program aims to elucidate virulence strategies that enhance
the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa. We recently employed a comparative genomics approach to interrogate the
accessory genomes of 100 clinical isolates for potential factors that augment the virulence of P. aeruginosa. By
comparing virulence in a mouse infection model with the presence or absence of genes in the accessory genome,
we identified several virulence determinants enriched among highly virulent P. aeruginosa strains that were
absent from less virulent strains. From this work we identified an accessory virulence factor that spanned a
portion of two genes encoding products involved in contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI). CDI is one type
of competitive mechanism microorganisms use to antagonize their immediate neighbors by delivering protein
toxins directly into targeted cells. This antagonism is executed by CdiA, a large multidomain exoprotein that sits
at the surface of an attacking cell and delivers a self-contained toxin domain into the targeted cell. The
importance of this proposal stems from our discovery that: (i) CdiA contains a toxin domain that has tRNAse
activity against prokaryotic and eukaryotic substrates, (ii) mutations that abrogate the in vitro tRNAse activity
attenuate both CDI and virulence in mice, (iii) the CdiA-toxin domain has cytopathic effects on eukaryotic cells
dependent upon its tRNase activity. To our knowledge this dule role for CdiA in both interbacterial completion
and virulence within a mammalian host has not yet been investigated for P. aeruginosa. From this preliminary
work we hypothesize that P. aeruginosa can utilize CdiA to intoxicate host cells for overcoming barriers to
infection. Our proposal seeks to answer a number of outstanding questions at the molecular (Aim 1), cellular
(Aim 2), and organismal (Aim 3) level. Successful completion of these aims will provide detailed insight into how
CdiA contributes to P. aeruginosa pathobiology."

This core is central for all experiments in this program project and capitalizes on the Pakistan Genomic Resource
(PGR) that has established the largest biobank of “Human Knockouts”. Specifically, PGR has leveraged high
levels of consanguinity in Pakistan and has conducted whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies in
80,000 participants and has already identified complete KOs for >5000 genes and heterozygous KOs for >18,000
genes. PGR has also found rare homozygotes for many missense variants, many of which have now been
characterized to be loss of function (LoF) or gain of function (GoF). Moreover, PGR has also recruited > 45,000
cases with myocardial infarction, > 20,000 cases with echo-confirmed heart failure, > 6,000 cases with imaging
confirmed stroke – all of these participants have undergone genotyping for GWAS and whole-exome sequencing
studies. Services that will be provided by the core will include: (i) for high priority genes across the four projects,
deep phenotyping of KOs / mutant probands and their consanguineous family members. Such phenotyping
studies will include: detailed clinical exams, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms, assessment of
any rhythm disorders through Biotel patch heart monitors, exercise stress test, and detailed biochemical exams;
(ii) analyses of large-scale genomic data in relation to cardiovascular traits and outcomes (i.e., myocardial
infarction, stroke, heart failure, ECG traits and other risk factors) recorded in PGR, UKBiobank and other
population-based resources in up to 1 million participants."
10839838,"SUMMARY
Heart failure (HF) affects >6 million people in the United States and accounts for 400,000 deaths each year.
Deepened fundamental insights into molecular mechanisms that underlie normal cardiac physiology, and how
their dysregulation contributes to heart disease is essential for identifying new drug targets and developing new
therapeutics to combat heart disease. Ca2+ cycling is indispensable for heart function, and derangement of
cardiomyocyte (CM) Ca2+ signaling is a prominent hallmark of heart disease. The L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.2)
is the dominant pathway for Ca2+ entry into CMs and initiates excitation-contraction coupling, regulates action
potential duration, and controls other essential Ca2+-dependent. The overall hypotheses motivating this proposal
are: that there is spatial and functional heterogeneity of CaV1.2 in heart cells that is critical for normal cardiac
physiology; that derangement of CaV1.2 molecular and functional organization caused by chronic stress or
genetic mutations contributes prominently to cardiac pathophysiology; and that posttranslationally regulating
CaV1.2 functional expression is a prospective approach for treating heart diseases. There is foundational, but
preliminary, evidence in the literature to support these hypotheses. However, the capacity to build on these initial
observations to forge a more complete understanding of the molecular and functional heterogeneity of CaV1.2
signaling complexes in heart cells in physiology and disease is hampered by a dearth of methods to visualize
and selectively manipulate such distinctive Ca2+ signaling complexes. We have developed several novel tools to
bridge this gap including; a transgenic mouse expressing a YFP-fused pore-forming α1C subunit with an
extracellular epitope tag in the heart, and engineered nanobodies that permit bi-directional regulation of CaV1.2
functional expression. We combine these tools with two unique resources - a catalogue of proteins located in
CaV1.2 nanodomains in heart defined using a proximity-labeling proteomics assay, and the Pakistan Genome
Resource, which contains gene sequence and extensive phenotype data from >80,000 individuals with high
rates of consanguinity that result in a prevalence of genetic mutations including heterozygous null and missense
mutations in α1C. We propose three Aims: 1) Develop novel tools to probe dynamic trafficking, organization, and
regulation of CaV1.2 signaling complexes in live CMs in physiology and disease; 2) Develop engineered
nanobodies that increase functional expression of CaV1.2 and evaluate their efficacy in preventing progression
to HF after myocardial infarction. 3) Assess functional impact of α1C loss-of-function mutations in humans."
10839843,"The overarching goal of this PPG is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate local Ca2+ signaling in
normal and failing hearts with unprecedented precision. There are three subaims shared by the four projects:
1) explore the precise role of adrenergic signaling in modulating calcium in normal and failing hearts; 2) define
novel mechanisms of interactions between t-tubule and SR calcium channels; 3) develop new understandings
of genetic based mechanics of inherited forms of CV disease involving calcium. Our long-term goals are to
elucidate mechanisms underlying the progressive decompensation towards advanced HF, and to identify novel
cellular targets and signaling pathways to prevent and treat the symptoms of HF, and to prevent arrhythmias.
Project 2 focuses on the regulation of the Ca2+ channel by the adrenergic nervous system, both under
physiological and pathological conditions. Recently, we identified the mechanism by which -adrenergic
agonists stimulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We expressed 1C or 2B subunits conjugated to ascorbate-
peroxidase in mouse hearts and used multiplexed, quantitative proteomics to track hundreds of proteins in
close proximity to CaV1.2. We observed that the Ca2+ channel inhibitor Rad, a monomeric G-protein, is
enriched in the CaV1.2 micro-environment but is depleted during -adrenergic stimulation. PKA-catalyzed
phosphorylation of specific serine residues on Rad decreases its affinity for auxiliary -subunits and relieves
constitutive inhibition of CaV1.2 observed as an increase in channel open probability. We created knock-in
mice with alanine substitutions of the four PKA phosphorylation sites. The stimulatory effect of isoproterenol
or forskolin on Ca2+ current is completely eliminated when Rad can no longer be phosphorylated in atrial and
ventricular cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, loss of PKA phosphorylation of Rad markedly diminished the
adrenergic stimulation of the Ca2+ transient and sarcomere shortening. One of our goals is to investigate the
relevance of RRAD in humans through analyses of common and rare variants in 20,000 cases with HF, 45,000
cases with MI and equivalent number of controls for each outcome, and to understand the consequences of
RRAD deletion and missense mutations through deep phenotyping of carriers and non-carriers of these
mutations in consanguineous families in the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR). Three specific aims are
proposed: (1) To determine the impact of -adrenergic stimulation of CaV1.2 in HF. We will use knock-in mice
with PKA phosphorylation sites of Rad mutated to alanine, and mice lacking the Rad-subunit interaction in
heart. (2) To determine upstream and downstream regulatory pathways modulating adrenergic stimulation of
CaV1.2 in physiological and HF states. (3) To explore the role of Rad in regulating cardiac function in humans.
We anticipate that this multi-pronged approach will yield novel mechanistic insights into adrenergic signaling in
HF and more specifically the adrenergic regulation of Ca2+ channels in HF."

To initiate molecular characterization of the CaCC calcium-activated chloride channels that have been found
in multiple neuronal types since 1980s, we first showed that CaCC is formed by TMEM16A or TMEM16B in
2008. The mammalian TMEM16 family with ten members turns out to be surprisingly diverse, with family
members acting as calcium-activated ion channels and/or calcium-activated lipid scramblase. The TMEM16
family members provide a variety of activities in central neurons to serve important functions such as
modulation of neuronal excitability and thermoregulation. Indeed, some of the mammalian TMEM16 family
members have been associated with human diseases such as febrile seizure and neurodegeneration as well
as Scott syndrome, a bleeding disorder. Therefore, it will be important to conduct molecular and cell biological
investigations to learn about the mechanisms that underlie the functions of these TMEM16 family members.
To ask how the calcium-activated chloride channel works, we solved cryo-EM structures of calcium-free and
calcium-bound TMEM16A and carried out structure-inspired site-directed mutagenesis to identify 10 pore-
lining residues important for anion selectivity and 7 pore-lining residues near pore constrictions important for
channel gating. We then showed that TMEM16B modulates action potential waveform and firing patterns in
multiple brain regions. To ask how TMEM16F fulfils the dual functions of calcium-activated ion channel and
calcium-activated lipid scramblase, we examined cryo-EM structures of TMEM16F and conducted structure-
inspired site-directed mutagenesis to provide evidence for separate pathways in TMEM16F for ion permeation
and lipid scrambling.
To establish the physiological importance of TMEM16 family members, we generated knockout (KO) mice to
show that they provide mouse models for human diseases, such as the bleeding disorder Scott syndrome
(TMEM16F), febrile seizure (TMEM16C), and the progressive neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar
ataxia (TMEM16K). To monitor endogenous TMEM16C in various cell types in the brain, we modified the split
GFP approach by using CRISPR mediated knock-in to fuse the FLAG tag along with the 11th beta strand of
GFP to the C-terminus of TMEM16C, and expressing GFP1-10 (the rest of GFP) in a Cre-dependent manner
in specific cell types. This approach will allow visualization of fluorescently tagged endogenous proteins as
well as identification of their associated proteins for better understanding of their physiological functions."
10896918,"Summary
Investigators at the University of Minnesota have teamed up to engineer novel protein activators of the Notch
family of cell surface receptors, which are master regulators of T-cell differentiation from induced pluripotent
stem cells. This technology will accelerate the development of engineered T cell therapies for treating cancer as
well as a range of diseases including auto-immune disorders, infectious disease, immune-deficiencies, graft vs.
host disease, and organ transplant rejection. Existing FDA approved engineered T cells are powerful
therapeutics yet major challenges remain, including difficulty in differentiating T cells from precursor cell types
and difficulty in editing and validating precursor cells prior to differentiation. To overcome these limitations and
to enable a transformative jump in T cell engineering approaches, the research team is developing reagents that
target and trigger conformational opening of the proteolytic switch NRR domain of Notch1. The Notch NRR
buries a cryptic protease site that is normally only exposed to its protease physiologically by tugging forces
generated during binding of its ligand on a neighboring cell. The project aims to develop soluble nanobody
reagents that functionally pry open the domain and remove the requirement for co-culture with Notch ligands
during T cell differentiation. In Aim 1 of the project, phage-display protein engineering is used to identify and
optimize nanobodies that selectively bind structurally distinct states of the Notch1 NRR. In Aim 2, these
nanobodies are strategically linked together in arrays for creating potent Notch1 activators by inducing
conformational “opening” of the NRR. In Aim 3, iPSC cell lines that report Notch1 signaling and T cell commitment
will be developed, characterized, and then used in assays monitoring differentiation of iPSCs into T cells under
induction by engineered Notch1 activators. In the final stage of the project, the reporter cell lines will be used in
benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of Notch1 activators developed in Aim 1 and 2, to
industry standard technologies. The milestones of this project are: (a) generating a tool set of molecules that
bind selectively to the Notch1 NRR; (b) developing a panel of iPSC reporter systems that monitor commitment
and differentiation of iPSCs to T cells that have normal physiologic function including cell killing potential; (c)
creating potent and selective Notch1 activators that induce iPSCs to differentiate into T cells with a marked
improvement in the efficiency differentiation and expansion over current approaches. This will enable
development of improved cancer treatments, and improve health disparities by increasing access to treatment
with a standardized iPSC-based cell source that can be frozen and banked for multiple doses while significantly
bringing down cost per product."
10808936,"In 2011 the National Academy of Medicine convened a panel to explore the paradox of why the US spends
more on healthcare than other Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries yet
has inferior outcomes. It concluded that “Data are simply lacking to fully understand the causal factors
responsible for each of the diseases and injuries that disproportionately affect the US population.” Although
aggregate measures of health systems performance such as life expectancy and infant mortality rates suggest
that US health care system performance lags, a limited number of direct comparisons of medical treatments
suggest that the US may have better outcomes than OECD peers for acute conditions including hip fracture
(HF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Modestly improved US outcomes, however, come at the expense
of extraordinarily high utilization of cardiac catheterization for AMI and other costly procedures. Moreover,
disadvantaged populations in the US may fare worse than disadvantaged populations in other countries.
It is a convenient narrative to simply conclude that the US spends more and gets less from an underperforming
healthcare system. Yet, there may be a more nuanced story. Some research supports the notion that
differences in where money is spent (acute care vs. social services) might explain part of the differences in
health outcomes. Thus further rigorous research is needed to understand better the contributions of the health
care system to outcomes. We propose to update a disjointed, incomplete and outdated literature by
systematically studying patterns of utilization, outcomes, and treatment intensity for older adults with specific
acute conditions treated in wealthy countries with vastly different healthcare systems. Our research will inform
the debate about whether more intensive treatment practices in the US also lead to better outcomes.
The overarching objective of our study is to compare treatment for older adults from five OECD countries (US,
Canada, Netherlands, Israel and England) hospitalized with one of 5 carefully selected tracer conditions: hip
fracture (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI); ischemic stroke, elective aortic aneurysm repair (AAA), and
congestive heart failure (CHF). Our proposal has five specific aims that assess: (1) differences in the
epidemiology of the conditions; (2) differences in treatment intensity; (3) differences in outcomes, including
mortality at 90 days and one year; (4) differences after stratifying by socioeconomic status and overall health;
and (5) differential changes in treatment patterns over time. Our proposed work will provide a nuanced
understanding of the effectiveness of treatment approaches in the five countries and will provide insights into
the functioning of their health care systems. The scientific premise of our proposal is that granular information
is needed to inform the study of comparative health systems. In addition, the international collaboration that
we form for this proposal will serve as the basis for developing research methods and expertise in using
nationally representative data to compare healthcare across countries."
10828733,"ABSTRACT
Currently no cure exists for the autoimmune disease Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The Juvenile Diabetes Research
Foundation estimates ~80 individuals are newly diagnosed with the disease, daily. Due to immune-mediated
destruction of the insulin-producing β cells, current treatment of T1D is limited to daily exogenous insulin
administration. What is needed are immunotherapies that selectively suppress  cell autoimmunity for the
prevention and treatment of T1D. One approach is the administration of  cell autoantigen to suppress and
tolerize diabetogenic effector T cells. Importantly, this approach avoids effects on protective immunity seen with
other T1D immunotherapies tested in the clinic. Although promising, antigen-based immunotherapy for T1D has
shown only modest clinical results. We have been studying biodegradable, acetalated dextran microparticles
(Ac-DEX MPs) as a polymeric vehicle to deliver antigen and immunomodulatory drugs. Ac-DEX MPs have a
number of properties well suited for suppressing T cell-mediated autoimmunity and reestablishing self-tolerance.
Notably, Ac-DEX MPs can be manipulated to release cargo in vivo in a tunable manner. We have shown that
timing of cargo release has marked effects on the nature and magnitude of the immune response that is elicited.
Furthermore, using this platform, we have recently shown that delivery of Ac-DEX MPs encapsulating a tolerizing
agent (rapamycin) and a  cell-derived peptide effectively prevents diabetes in an adoptive T cell transfer model
of T1D. Accordingly, the focus of the current proposal is to develop and characterize the tolerogenic properties
of Ac-DEX MPs encapsulating immunomodulatory drugs and  cell-derived peptides as a means to selectively
suppress the diabetogenic response. We hypothesize that the rate of MP degradation plus the co-encapsulation
of immunomodulatory agent enhances the tolerogenic potency of our peptide-based vaccine. To test this
hypothesis, we have proposed two Aims: Specific Aim 1: Encapsulation of rapamycin and antigens in
tunable Ac-DEX particles and optimization of particle system. Here we will establish drug, dosing, and
degradation rate of the microparticles for optimum inhibition of the autoimmune response. Specific Aim 2:
Evaluation of Ac-DEX particle formulation and mechanism of tolerance in animal models of T1D. In this
Aim, we will evaluate the trafficking of the MPs as related to immune cell uptake, characterizing the underlying
tolerogenic responses generated by the formulation, evaluate the protective and therapeutic efficacy of the
platform, and confirm that the therapy has no effect on acquired immunity."
10834924,"Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element and Cu imbalance is the underlying etiology of several human diseases, including Menkes disease, Wilsonʼs disease, myeloneuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. Menkes disease, caused by mutations in the ATP7A Cu transporter, leads to organismal Cu deficiency that results in connective tissue defects and severe lethal neurodegeneration. Menkes patients also exhibit hypothermia, suggesting a link between Cu metabolism and mammalian thermogenic pathways. Thermogenesis is supported by several layers of metabolism coordinately regulated in multiple tissues. The major location for heat generation is adipose tissue, which responds to hormones generated by the sympathetic nervous system. For example, noradrenaline (NE) stimulation activates β3 adrenergic receptors expressed in adipose tissue, which in turn upregulates lipolysis, mitogenesis, and uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), culminating in a thermogenic response. It has generally been assumed that the hypothermia observed in Menkes patients is at least partly due to Cu deficiency in adipose tissue, where inadequate levels of any metal cofactor for the electron transport chain would impair the mitochondrial activity required for heat generation. However, the underlying mechanisms linking Cu homeostasis to adaptive thermogenesis have not yet been elucidated. The current proposal seeks to clarify the nature of this connection and improve our understanding of how Cu metabolism and adipose biology intersect. We plan to use genetic, pharmacological, and cell biological methods to study parallel thermogenesis models, including adipose-specific knockout mice, and cultured primary and immortalized adipocytes. Preliminary studies have shown a unique role for Cu in adaptive thermogenesis, as mice exposed to cold or adrenergic stimulators specifically import Cu (rather than both Cu and iron) into adipose tissue and mice lacking adipose expression of the high affinity Cu importer Ctr1 are more sensitive to cold exposure than mice lacking the iron importer Tfr1. We outline three specific aims to uncover how Cu homeostasis pathways intersect with thermogenic pathways in adipose tissue, and in doing so, uncover how Cu metabolism interacts with global energy regulation: (1) Establish a role for Cu in adipose thermoregulation and systemic energy homeostasis using tissue-specific Ctr1 and Atp7a mutant mice, (2) Determine how coordinated regulation of Ctr family proteins controls Cu availability in adipocytes upon β3-AR stimulation, and (3) Uncover mechanisms for CTR1-mediated thermogenesis and adipocyte browning."
10881882,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the top ten most common cancers worldwide and is comprised of multiple
distinct histologies. One particularly aggressive subtype of RCC is translocation renal cell carcinoma (tRCC), a
devastating and aggressive neoplasm that is defined by a gene fusion involving a transcription factor in the
MiT/TFE gene family, most commonly TFE3. Currently, there are no approved therapeutic agents that are
specifically targeted to the biology of tRCC. In addition, we have an incomplete understanding of how TFE3
fusions drive this cancer, which represents a major unmet medical need. We recently applied genomic discovery
approaches to identify genes and/or pathways that may represent novel therapeutic targets in tRCC. These
studies revealed activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway – a master regulator
of a cell’s response to oxidative stress – to be a defining feature of tRCC. Interestingly, in tRCC, NRF2 activation
occurs without the activating somatic alterations in this pathway that are usually found in other cancers, such as
amplification of NFE2L2 (the gene encoding NRF2) or inactivation of KEAP1 (a negative regulator of NRF2),
suggesting a novel mode of NRF2 regulation in tRCC. In this project, we will explore the molecular mechanisms
by which NRF2 signaling is activated in tRCC and will also establish the therapeutic potential of targeting the
NRF2 pathway in this cancer. In Aim 1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which TFE3 fusions regulate
NRF2 signaling in tRCC. We will test the hypothesis that TFE3 fusions and NRF2 coordinately regulate the
expression and function of critical antioxidant genes. We will also use unbiased functional genetic and chemical
proteomic approaches to identify critical redox-sensitive effectors of TFE3 fusions in tRCC. In Aim 2, we will test
the functional consequences and therapeutic potential of NRF2 pathway inhibition in tRCC. We will assess
protein markers of NRF2 pathway activation in tRCC tumor tissue. We will then use both genetic and small
molecule approaches to determine whether NRF2 inhibition represents a dependency in tRCC cells both in vitro
and in vivo. This project leverages innovative biochemical and functional genetic approaches to clarify the basic
mechanisms by which NRF2 signaling is regulated by TFE3 fusions. More broadly, these studies may have
implications for understanding how the NRF2 pathway is regulated in other cancers. This project also seeks to
credential the NRF2 pathway as a therapeutic target in tRCC, thereby advancing a mechanism-driven
therapeutic hypothesis with the potential to improve outcomes in a cancer that represents an unmet medical
need with no established standard of care."
10847369,"Abstract
Up to two-thirds of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) will not respond to standard
pharmacological and psychological interventions, suggesting a need to develop novel therapeutics. Decreased
reactivity to positive stimuli, indexed by low amygdala reactivity to positive autobiographical memory recall,
may be a causal mechanism interfering with recovery from MDD. Previous work suggests that individuals who
do respond to antidepressant medications show increased amygdala activity to positive stimuli that is
indistinguishable from controls, while those who do not respond fail to show this increase in amygdala activity.
In several small studies we have shown that MDD participants are able to increase their amygdala response
during positive memory recall via real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf) training, and that this increase is
associated with large and rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. Here, we propose to evaluate the efficacy
of this intervention in a large-scale confirmatory R01 clinical trial. N=200 MDD individuals will be randomly
assigned under double-blind conditions to the amygdala rtfMRI-nf intervention or to a control rtfMRI-nf
intervention where they receive yoked sham neurofeedback (instead of their own brain activity they see the
signal from another participant who underwent amygdala rtfMRI-nf). We propose to use the same
neurofeedback paradigm as our prior studies, with one critical difference. Rather than using a control condition
that involves training another brain region, we will adopt a yoked sham control group in order to demonstrate
that our findings are robust to the type of control condition used. We additionally aim to determine whether we
can use self-report mechanisms to assess who might need the proposed neurofeedback intervention and
whether they are likely to be successful in using it. Finally, we will work with implementation scientists to obtain
feedback from end-users and clinicians to understand contextual influences on outcomes and increase
intervention acceptability. Success will confirm a new non-pharmacological, non-invasive intervention for MDD
individuals."
10837804,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration, and other diseases that lead to dementia are one of
the 21st century’s major public health problems. This family of neurodegenerative diseases involves the
disruption of functional brain circuits and ultimately the death of brain cells. In living people, the standard
measure of neurodegeneration is derived from brain MRI scans, which can quantitatively measure the location
and amount of atrophy. This is traditionally done, and continues to be done in many studies, over intervals of
one year, with one or two scans collected one year apart, estimating annualized rates of brain atrophy. In some
clinical trials, scans may be collected more frequently, but in one recent failed phase III trial aiming to slow
neurodegeneration they were collected 80 weeks apart. The goal of this work is to demonstrate that new
methods we and our colleagues have developed are able to improve the sensitivity to detect atrophy within
individuals over short intervals of time, down to as little as 3 months. This is done by making a large number of
extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements at each time point for each individual. We aim to
demonstrate the reliability and validity of these new MRI measures of neurodegeneration against traditional
MRI measures and externally validated against PET and clinical measures in individuals with Early-onset
Alzheimer’s disease or behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia. If successful, this work could revolutionize
the field and open the door to a new means to track neurodegeneration, potentially greatly facilitating clinical
trials."
10823324,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs
throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS-
CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases
were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus,
there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number
of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ
dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical.
Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently
funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical
informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds
on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the
effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing,
machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use
novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the
identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system,
Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a
state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will
recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term
outcomes after recovery (Aim 3).
This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of
clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies,
computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester-
long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team
of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of
epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling.
After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children
affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary
infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical
epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics."

Project Summary
Clinically significant hearing loss is present in at least 1.9 per 1,000 infants at birth and affects nearly half of the
population at some time in their lives. Nearly 70% of congenital or prelingual deafness is genetic in origin, and
of these up to 93% are monogenic autosomal recessive traits. Some forms of genetic deafness can be
recognized by their associated syndromic features, but in most cases, hearing loss is the only finding (NSHL).
DNA variants in currently recognized deafness genes are not detected in more than one-third of affected
individuals with autosomal recessive NSHL, leaving large number of families without a molecular diagnosis.
We established a repository that contains biological samples and clinical data on about three thousand families
with NSHL. Of these, over a thousand include at least two affected members and are consistent with
autosomal recessive NSHL. The most common forms of NSHL have been excluded in all families; all known
deafness genes were excluded in over four hundred families. We will use genome sequencing to identify
underlying coding and non-coding variants in families with autosomal recessive NSHL that remain unsolved in
our Repository. Availability of a large number of inbred families will facilitate analysis within autozygous
regions. To support the role of identified variants in pathophysiology, we will perform functional experiments
utilizing in vitro and mouse models. We have successfully applied this strategy to discover novel deafness
genes during the previous cycles of this application. Detected variants and associated audio-vestibular
phenotypes will be stored in a database that will be accessible by outside researchers. The outcomes of this
proposal will be discoveries of novel coding and non-coding variants in genes and pathways involved in the
pathophysiology of deafness, foundation of molecular diagnostic tests for etiological diagnosis, counseling, and
candidacy for molecular treatments of affected individuals.

The goal of this proposal is to train the next generation of scientists that will advance our understanding of
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) at Yale University, and to fulfil the promise of developing
disease-modifying therapeutics for these debilitating conditions. The rationale of this program is to take an
integrated approach to understand the diversity and similarities of ADRD conditions as well as their co-morbidity,
using cell biology, structural biology, pathology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Twenty nine (29) faculty from
twelve (12) basic and clinical departments at Yale School of Medicine and Yale College are participants in this
multidisciplinary program. The program offers both depth and breadth. The depth derives from the expertise of
the faculty investigating ADRDs and the many institutional resources that can be brought to bear including, an
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), a Parkinson’s Foundation Research Center, three Aligning
Science Across Parkinson’s (ASAP) teams, a recently instituted Center for Human Brain Discovery brain bank,
and a new research building where most mentors will co-locate. The breadth of the program derives from the
diversity of approaches being used to tackle these diseases ranging from genetics to drug development. Mentors
are Ph.Ds. and M.D.s. with substantial NIH support and NIA/NINDS related research foci. Faculty investigate all
major forms of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTLD), Lewy Body
Dementia (LBD), and Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Methodologies
include deep sequencing; transcriptomics; proteomics; cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture;
immunohistochemistry; electron and advanced light microscopy; biochemistry and molecular analyses; structural
biology; rodent, monkey behavior; and fMRI and PET imaging in human subjects. Six predoctoral positions are
requested. Trainees are selected by the Executive Committee from an outstanding pool of advanced
Neuroscience and Biology graduate students (3rd and 4th year), which are amongst the best in the country and
come from a variety of backgrounds in the sciences. Trainees are selected based on their potential for
excellence, leadership in research as well as their diverse backgrounds. Training includes focused coursework,
instruction in experimental design and statistical methods, Clinicopathologic correlation (CPC) conferences,
thoughtful mentorship through advisory committees with oral and written feedback, structured seminar programs,
career skills development, and numerous opportunities for written and oral presentation of research progress."
10908997,"Funds are requested to support the Rochester Toxicology Training Program. There are pressing societal
demands to identify and evaluate the impact of an ever-increasing array of environmental chemical, physical,
and social stressors on human health. The overall objective of this Program is to provide pre- and postdoctoral
training for the next generation of talented, independent toxicologists and environmental health scientists with
critical thinking skills who will conduct novel research and actively transform their findings, and findings from
others, into new information. This information will then be translated for use by scientists, public health and
medical professionals, governmental and other agencies, and the public to improve overall human health and
well-being. This Program is distinguished by its exceptional environment for training in toxicology, as evidenced
by the success of prior trainees, the remarkable collegiality and extensive collaborations amongst faculty and
trainees, a broad base of research support, and its strong leadership and institutional commitment. The Program
is dedicated to meeting the needs of trainees from diverse backgrounds and supporting their individualized goals
for careers in academia, government, and industry. The Program’s framework is based on the philosophy that
training for the future workforce requires multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches, close working
relationships between trainees and their mentoring teams, and a culture that supports diversity, autonomy, and
career development. The Program takes advantage of extensive expertise and resources that are available at a
major academic medical center by reaching beyond a single department. The Program is housed in the
Department of Environmental Medicine, yet the 31 faculty mentors come from 13 basic science and clinical
departments and divisions within the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Faculty research
spans the entire spectrum of toxicology, from molecular mechanisms and cellular processes to whole animals
and human populations. There are 7 keystone research areas (Neurotoxicology and Behavioral Toxicology,
Pulmonary & Cardiovascular Toxicology, Developmental & Reproductive Toxicology, Immunotoxicology,
Musculoskeletal Toxicology, Dermal Toxicology and Endocrine Toxicology) that are rooted in contemporary
themes that include particles and air pollution, molecular-genetic modifiers of toxicity, developmental origins of
health and disease, epigenetic regulatory systems, and social determinants of disease. The Program is also
tightly integrated with other training programs, as well as research and professional development support centers
at the University. During the current cycle of this training grant, refinements to the didactic curriculum were
adopted, new environmental health research expertise was added, equity and diversity initiatives were launched,
and strategies to recruit and retain trainees from diverse backgrounds were revised. Continued support of the
Rochester Toxicology Training Program will ensure that a reliable stream of exceptionally well-prepared PhD-
level toxicologists will be ready to meet the growing demands of the today’s health science workforce."

We propose a renewal of our long-standing training program in Neurocognitive Approaches to Communication
Disorders (now in its 15th year), which currently supports 5 pre-doctoral trainees. This training program is
designed to educate clinically sophisticated scientists who will apply their research skills to the study of
language and communicative disorders, and who will, likewise, apply their clinical acumen to their research
endeavors. The program takes advantage of the rich intellectual resources available in the San Diego region,
and in particular, the SDSU/UCSD Joint Doctoral Program in Language and Communicative Disorders (JDP-
LCD). San Diego has an active research community in this field, with 25 faculty members from SDSU and
UCSD participating in this training program, including 6 new faculty members since the last renewal.
 Our interdisciplinary training program, for the next five years, will be headed by our Training Grant
Executive Committee of senior investigators. Our mentor team, drawn from faculty in SLHS, Psychology,
Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Psychiatry and Neuroscience across both universities, has conducted
impactful research on clinically relevant topics, with expertise in a wide range of research methodologies and
clinical populations. The faculty mentors, including rising stars and distinguished leaders in the field, have the
requisite research backgrounds and mentoring skills to support a rich training environment.
 The training program will continue to be focused on research with or directly applicable to clinical
populations, while at the same time appreciating basic science underpinnings. To this end, trainees are
required to work with mentors who investigate clinical populations and are required to conduct such research.
Further, trainees are required to get direct experience with two different clinical populations, through
laboratory rotations with their mentors and other faculty. Importantly, for those trainees who chose to become
clinically certified speech-language pathologists, a special clinical track is available.
 In support of the growing enrollment in the JDP-LCD, we request 6 pre-doctoral trainees per year for
two-year appointments in this renewal. This would bring us to the original number of trainees provided in
years 1-10 of our program. Our training program has already provided predoctoral training to a substantial
number of highly qualified, diverse scientists. Adding to our existing training program (optional clinic track,
pathway to funding), we propose novel value-added activities to train the Whole Academic. These activities
include professional development seminars and roundtables to encourage clinical and research trainings that
facilitate vertical interactions among students from different years in the program and greater collaboration
amongst researchers with overlapping interest. With rich existing resources and broad commitments from the
program faculty and other university stakeholders to providing advanced training in clinically relevant
research, this training program offers a springboard for future leaders in communication disorders."

fellows in biochemical, chemical, biological and structural approaches for cancer research. The
training program integrates contemporary cancer biology (e.g., oncogenes and tumor
suppressors, signal transduction, oncogenic transcription factors, DNA modifications, cell cycle
control, genomic surveillance) with the allied fields of chemical biology, chemical-genetics, and
structural biology. Over the past 35 years, this Training Program has an outstanding training
record and seeks to continue this multidisciplinary training program that is composed of 29
preceptors from nine academic departments and programs representing the Vanderbilt University
School of Medicine, School of Engineering, the College of Arts and Sciences and the Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. The training program is conducted within a vibrant academic
environment and is supported by close interactions with the Vanderbilt-Ingram NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, and the Vanderbilt
Center for Structural Biology, all of which offer resources for trainees and preceptors. In addition
to departmental and preceptor-specific laboratory instruction, each trainee receives cancer-
related training in the form of three courses focused on cancer biology and experimental cancer
research. An Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP), the Chemical and Physical Biology
Program (CPB), and an independent graduate program in Chemistry all academically support
predoctoral trainees. This renewal applications continues several recent enhancements to our
training program including a Precision Cancer Medicine course that provides an immersive clinical
experience. In the COVID era, we have also lauched 15 bioinformics micro-training courses for
large datasets. We have an active mentoring program that includes former student trainees,
postdoctoral mentors, and faculty mentors, which ensures the continued development of
academic skills for cancer research and career development. Significant institutional investment
in training programs, core facilities, state-of-the-art laboratories and equipment that provide
technology resources applicable to cancer biology and molecular structures also enhance trainee
development. The institution has also made additional investiments to provide an inclusing
training environment that his free of any form of harassment or discrimination while emphasizing
rigor, reproducibility and transparency. This integrated training in biochemistry, chemistry,
structural biology, and cancer biology is critical to the molecular understanding of cancer and the
development of new approaches to molecularly targeted therapeutics."

This application requests funding to support eight predoctoral students in the University of Oregon’s Genetics
Training Program (GTP). The students will train with one of 27 faculty mentors whose expertise collectively span
the subdisciplines of molecular, developmental, and evolutionary genetics. The mission of the GTP is to provide
PhD students with rigorous, well-rounded, and individualized training as geneticists that enables them to develop
their own scientific identities and pursue fulfilling careers in diverse scientific professions. The cohort of trainees
will share required coursework in foundational genetics, biostatistics, computer programming, and responsible
conduct of research. Trainees will conduct mentored research and individualized courses of study to deepen
their domain knowledge and grow their identities as scientific experts. Through a Career Development Program,
trainees will develop an understanding of the landscape of career opportunities available to them and will
examine their own talents and passions to identify career trajectories of interest. As members of a learning
community that values honesty, transparency, and rigor, our trainees develop into responsible scientific leaders.
The programmatic goals of the GTP are to: 1) Train graduate students to be fluent in foundational genetic
concepts, modern experimental techniques, and quantitative analytical approaches, enabling them to make
scientific discoveries that advance the field of genetics; 2) Prepare graduate students to be independent
professionals with the knowledge and skills to pursue fulfilling careers within the biomedical research enterprise
that build on their foundational knowledge of genetics; 3) Empower graduate students to be conscientious
citizens of the scientific community who uphold high standards of scientific rigor and reproducibility, safe
practices, and ethical conduct, and who shoulder the responsibility of communicating genetic concepts to the lay
public. We propose a robust evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of our training activities in
achieving these goals and to implement programmatic changes to best serve the training needs of a diverse
cohort of students. The impacts of this program will be to advance new knowledge in genetics, contribute to a
diverse and productive research workforce, and promote a culture of ethical, responsible, and trustworthy
science."

A creative, innovative biomedical workforce depends on diverse teams lead by PhD scientists trained in technical
skills and culturally-aware people skills. The United States’ population of historically excluded groups, which
include those from underrepresented minorities (URMs), disadvantaged backgrounds, and/or those with
disabilities, is growing, corresponding to an increased interest in STEM fields. However, barriers to equity and
access have led to lower rates of entry into PhD programs and scientific careers by minoritized groups. With the
growing complexity and urgency of the health and well-being challenges facing our country, we simply cannot
afford to continue to exclude underrepresented groups from the research enterprise. Here, we propose to support
16 Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) scholars at San Diego State University (SDSU) with
research-validated supportive programming and faculty-mentored research experiences to develop critical
thinking, communication, leadership, interpersonal, technical, and resiliency skills. All MARC experiences are
developed through a culturally aware lens that seeks to build scholars’ sense of belonging, support their mental
health and wellness, and provides a culturally congruent and scientifically stimulating academic home. Here, we
are building on 33 successful years of our SDSU MARC program by introducing new partnerships with campus
Cultural Centers and disability services for recruitment and programming synergy, introducing a new near-peer
mentoring program to combat barriers to success in graduate programs, providing dedicated mentor training
within a cultural context that empowers faculty mentors to promote the development, self-efficacy, and
independence of their MARC scholars, and responding to scholar needs with new programming. We continue to
use evidence-based evaluation data to improve our MARC and pre-MARC programming to prioritize student
success and support, which we intend will only grow our success of scholars entering and completing PhD
programs. Our workshops, panels, seminars, coursework, and socials have been developed to build critical
thinking and quantitative skills, oral and written communication, ethics, reproducibility and rigor, leadership,
mental health and resiliency, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging. We assess all programming through
evaluation methods to ensure our program is always improving in terms of rigor, support, efficiency, and success
so that MARC scholars are prepared to enter and complete graduate programs. By leveraging key partnerships
at SDSU, we are able to synergize our infrastructure, programming, coursework, and mentorship relationships
so that we may expand our impact far beyond the requested 16 slots to provide instruction, discussion, and
inspiration for historically excluded STEM students and their allies across campus."

The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) Medical Student Training in Aging and Injury Research is a 10-
12-week summer research training program with the goal of training 12 medical students per year in aging
and injury prevention research during the summer between their first and second years. The long-term goal is
to increase the pool of students who will pursue and apply aging research, with an emphasis on the risks for
and impact of injury through the life stages. The experience focuses on risk factors and outcomes associated
with injury, and research aimed at improving safety, health and quality of life for older individuals.
Specific objectives are to: 1) provide early exposure to injury research at a critical time in medical students’
career decision-making; 2) increase medical student knowledge regarding current investigative frontiers in
injury prevention, treatment and policy; 3) train students to apply a “geriatrics approach” in their research,
therapy and injury control efforts, emphasizing the special risks, needs and circumstances of the elderly; and
4) to stimulate and sustain medical students’ interest in research, injury control and aging by providing on-
going connection to the scientific community and future research pursuits throughout medical school training.
Trainees collaborate with experienced research faculty and research teams on aging research and injury-
related projects relevant to aging and the aged, such as falls prevention, neuromuscular and cognitive
function, depression/ suicide, toxicology, patient safety, chronic disease management and quality of
life after trauma. Faculty mentors bring expertise across the spectrum of Translational Science, from the
laboratory to clinical, community-based, and population health research, making it unique among MCW’s
funded research training programs. Students will participate in enrichment activities including: 1) seminars
offered to all summer research students, including training in ethical conduct in research, career development
and presentation skills; 2) weekly core seminars on injury and injury prevention across the lifespan, with
attention to the special needs and considerations of the elderly, including Falls, Abuse, Poisonings, the System
of Care for trauma; 3) clinical experiences related to injury prevention, such as home safety and functional
assessments, 4) presentation of their work at an Annual Medical Student Research Poster Day; and 5)
continued research through on-going mentorship, our required longitudinal Scholarly Pathways program, and
an optional Research Honors track.
The program builds on a highly successful institutional summer research program infrastructure, and strong
collaborations among MCW’s Comprehensive Injury Center and Center for Advancement of Population
Science, the Medicine Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Departments of Family and Community
Medicine, Emergency Medicine and Surgery, and affiliated faculty from basic, social and clinical sciences to
address injury prevention at every level, in a rich, collaborative learning environment."
10870073,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy is ubiquitous, deadly, and results from mutations in the
dystrophin gene. Dystrophin is an essential component of cardiac mechanotransduction (MT) and distributes
mechanical stress across the sarcolemma. In DMD, the absence of dystrophin results in cardiomyocytes that
are vulnerable to contraction-induced damage, which accelerates disease progression. Our understanding of
the early progression of DMD cardiomyopathy is limited due to models that do not fully recapitulate human
disease, thus limiting development of effective therapies. Given the essential role of dystrophin in connecting the
contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for MT, it is critical to augment DMD cardiomyopathy
models to include cell-ECM engagement with applied physiological force to recapitulate early changes at the
organ level necessary to test novel therapies. The human chambered muscle pump (hChaMP) can do just that.
The hChaMP is generated by 3D printing human induced pluripotent stem cells and bio-ink to yield a pump that
can be pressurized to impose progressive strain. The long-term goal is to determine mechanisms by which DMD
cardiomyopathy progresses to develop novel disease specific therapies to prevent cardiomyopathy. The overall
objective is to assess the role of altered MT and ECM dynamics in the absence of dystrophin on DMD
cardiomyopathy disease progression and to test dystrophin gene editing in a DMD hChaMP with volumetric
loading. The central hypothesis is that the loss of dystrophin leads to increased vulnerability to mechanical stress
resulting in early altered cardiac MT and ECM dynamics that promote disease progression and that early
dystrophin replacement will limit contraction-induced injury by restoring MT and ECM homeostasis and thereby
rescue DMD cardiomyopathy. Our central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) To evaluate the
impact of altered MT on DMD cardiomyopathy disease progression using the hChaMP model system with
progressive volumetric loading; 2) To determine the impact of dystrophin restoration with DMD precise gene
editing on cardiac remodeling mechanisms dictating disease progression in DMD cardiomyopathy. In aim 1, we
will generate a DMD hChaMPs to assess the physiologic impact of increased volumetric pressure on the human
DMD phenotype early and later. In aim 2, we will introduce DMD precise gene editing to restore dystrophin both
early and late in DMD hChaMPs with volumetric loading and assess the physiologic and transcriptional changes.
At the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes of our study is the
characterization of early DMD cardiomyopathy progression with loading and the underlying molecular
mechanisms. The proposed research is innovative as it combines enabling technologies to develop a 3D
preclinical model of human DMD cardiomyopathy that mimics disease progression and correction with precise
gene editing. These findings will have a significant impact on human health by increasing our understanding of
disease progression and a strong basis for treating and preventing DMD cardiomyopathy."

Exploring novel and unfamiliar foods, friend groups, and activities during adolescence critically shapes our
preferences and personalities in adulthood. Conversely, for adolescents who engage in underage drinking,
such novelty-seeking can be maladaptive and lead to the development of chronic alcohol use problems. Cross-
sectional studies suggest that individuals become more strategic in their use of goal-directed exploration to
optimize choice during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. The core hypothesis of the
proposed study is that the maturation of directed exploration is blunted or lagged in adolescents who
experiment with alcohol and go on to develop increased alcohol use problems. Specifically, we will conduct an
accelerated longitudinal fMRI study of N=135 participants (recruited at 13-21 years), merging clinical assays of
alcohol use severity, computational modeling of novelty-driven exploration across multiple tasks, model-based
decomposition of fMRI data at three longitudinal timepoints, and smartphone-based daily diary assessments to
probe alcohol- and novelty-related decision making in vivo outside of the laboratory. In Aim 1 we will test the
hypothesis that the normative maturation of novelty-driven exploration—i.e., expansion of strategic, goal-
directed exploration to optimize choice—will be negatively modulated by increased alcohol use severity.
Further, we will use longitudinal model-based fMRI to determine whether this expansion of directed exploration
is driven by age-related increases in neural encoding of the latent value of exploring new options in
frontoparietal (i.e., frontopolar cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and intraparietal lobule) and motivational
(i.e., striatum, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex) neural circuits. In Aim 2 we will contrast novelty-driven
exploration to maximize gains versus minimize losses, hypothesizing that the presence of potential
punishments should decrease exploratory behavior as individuals are motivated to avoid potential losses.
Differentiation between reward- and punishment-evoked neural responses is blunted in adolescents with
alcohol use problems, therefore we hypothesize that differential gating of novelty exploration across gain
versus loss contexts will be diminished in adolescents with higher alcohol use severity. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will
use daily diary prompts delivered via smartphone to determine the ecological relevance of our laboratory-
based decision making assays for predicting real-world alcohol- and novelty-directed behaviors. This
triangulation of computational phenotyping, neuroimaging, and ecologically-situated assessments has not been
performed in existing studies, and could identify a new novelty-driven exploration dimension to be considered
in future iterations of the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment framework. In line with the Katz Early Stage
Investigator mechanism—this computational developmental science approach will represent an innovative
advance that will launch the PI in a new research direction: leveraging his skills and expertise in adolescent
neuroimaging to focus on the development of decision making neurocircuitry and risk for alcohol use problems
in adolescence."

The specific aim of the resubmission of this training grant's competitive renewal proposal is to continue the
development of research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering
and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the detection, diagnosis and
assessment of treatment of disease. While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology
in Medicine Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of
Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging
track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer
Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers, Radiomics and many
Machine Learning/Deep Learning approaches (detection and diagnosis of disease) all of which seek to extract
additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The
Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined
imaging modalities, microfluidics, theranostics, development of personalized dosimetry for radionuclide therapy
and others, all of which focus on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and
pathological using Molecular Imaging technologies and processes. This includes investigations with applications
in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other
conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related
effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from investigating normal tissue responses to
radiation and mitigation of radiation effects on such tissues, tumor biology with special reference to cancer stem
cells, imaging cancer stem cells and responses to radiation therapy, combining radiation and immunotherapy
approaches and others. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment
delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion
models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods, real time MRI imaging and therapy
(using the ViewRay system) and brachytherapy techniques. This program has been training primarily Ph.D.
students for more than 60 years, and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with
investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a
common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications. This program has the faculty,
students, infrastructure and backing of its supporting Departments (Molecular and Medical Pharmacology,
Radiological Sciences and Radiation Oncology) as well as the Graduate Programs in Biosciences to continue to
achieve its goals of training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists."

The formation of the central nervous system (CNS) involves a fundamental cell fate diversification—the
generation of neurons and glia. The timed, sequential appearance of neurons followed by glia is critical for
properly organizing CNS cytoarchitecture and physiology. In support of this, perturbations of the neurogenic-
to-gliogenic timer have been demonstrated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, an understanding
of the mechanisms that control this cell fate decision is of utmost importance.
Although the gliogenic switch is a mechanism conserved from flies to humans, the primate cortex has undergone
significant cellular and molecular evolution that has contributed to the >1000 fold increase in cortical surface
area compared to rodents. These evolutionary changes include the expansion of a unique progenitor population
called outer radial glia, along with significant changes in the molecular, functional, and morphological features
of astrocytes. These observations support the hypothesis that outer radial glia are the cellular progenitors of
human astrocytes and that this population exhibits human-specific gliogenic drivers. This proposal aims to
address two key fundamental questions about human gliogenesis: (1) In which human progenitor cell(s) does
the gliogenic switch occur, and (2) what are the intrinsic mechanisms that drive glial competence?
In this proposal, we are utilizing human iPSC-derived cortical organoids as a reductionist model system to ask
what drives human gliogenesis. The organoid model system is ideal for addressing this question because (a)
gliogenesis occurs consistently and reproducibly within a narrow temporal window, and (b) it is genetically
tractable and amenable to precise temporal studies that are not possible in other platofrms. We have developed
two aims that systematically test (Aim 1) the origins and molecular drivers of human astrogenesis, and (Aim
2) the ability of human-specific pro-glial transcription factors to initiate gliogenesis. We propose a set of
experimental approaches that will trace lineage trajectories of individual cells throughout the gliogenic swtich
and also test the mechanistic impact of impaired gliogenic drivers. We also propose a set of innovative
experiments to test distinct activation schemes of candidate transcription factors tailored to their specific
temporal and spatial binding patterns during human development."
10868536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rare forms of familial Alzheimer disease (fAD) are known to be caused by life-long, genetically determined
perturbations in the production of the amyloid ß-protein (Aß), but the cause(s) of the vast majority of so-called
sporadic AD (sAD) cases remains remarkably poorly defined. This proposal will use state-of-the-art mouse
models of sAD together with several highly innovative approaches to address key temporal and spatial aspects
of sAD pathogenesis for the first time, with critical implications for the development of effective therapies.
Whereas fAD is attributable to chronic perturbations in the production of Aß, we hypothesize that sAD is triggered
by impairments in the clearance of Aß—specifically by transient impairments in Aß clearance. This hypothesis
is consistent with evidence showing that several established risk factors for sAD, such as brain trauma, stress,
or poor sleep, lead to short-lived or episodic increases in cerebral Aß levels due to reduced Aß clearance. To
model this novel mechanistic hypothesis, we employ innovative methods to inhibit Aß clearance transiently and
reversibly by blocking either blood-brain barrier transport of Aß or its proteolytic degradation. Because we aim
to define the triggers for sAD, we require an animal model that does not develop AD-type pathology on its own,
as most AD mouse models do. To this end, we will use an innovative new sAD mouse model, the APPNL-F/hAß
mice, which expresses wild-type human Aß only, under the control of the endogenous murine App promoter,
with the minimal genetic mutations needed to model sAD. As is true for normal humans, this sAD mouse model
develops diffuse deposits of human Aß in an age-dependent manner, and forms very minimal dense-core
plaques only at very advanced ages. Accordingly, these mice are ideal for investigating the pathophysiological
mechanisms responsible for triggering the conversion of “normal” Aß deposition to the pathological type in sAD.
We hypothesize further that the Aß-dependent pathological mechanisms most relevant to sAD occur much
earlier than the ages studied in clinical trials, with clinical symptoms emerging only much later, specifically in the
context of aging. Accordingly, we will define the temporal window most relevant to the emergence of AD by
increasing Aß levels in APPNL-F/hAß mice transiently at various ages, then evaluating the consequences for the
development of AD-type pathology longitudinally, up to and including old age.
Finally, we will test the novel hypothesize that spatially distinct pools of Aß (e.g., extra- vs. intracellular) impact
the pathogenesis of AD in qualitatively different ways. Specifically, we postulate that intracellular Aß is more
relevant than extracellular Aß to the neurodegeneration and memory loss that characterize AD. To test this, we
will selectively increase extra- vs. intracellular pools of Aß by reversibly downregulating Aß-degrading proteases
that, as our preliminary results show, selectively regulate these distinct pools of Aß. Collectively, these
experiments will allow us to investigate, cleanly and for the first time, many critical temporal and spatial aspects
of AD pathogenesis, yielding novel insights that will inform improved approaches to the treatment of sAD."

The U-RISE program at the University of Puerto Rico Cayey (UPR-C) provides research training to i) broaden
exposure to biomedical research careers, ii) strengthen science identity, and iii) enhance scientific information
literacy, learning, research, and quantitative and computational skills of undergraduate Hispanic students at
UPR-C. The U-RISE program will directly impact 24 undergraduate students through a wide range of activities.
Five program components have been designed employing evidence-based approaches to provide training to
undergraduate students: Research Seminars and Workshops (RSW), Learning and Research Skills (LRS),
Undergraduate Research Experiences (URE), Quantitative and Computational skills (QCS), and Evidence-
Based Teaching and Mentoring (EBT/EBM). The evaluation of each component will be monitored by an external
evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program directors, and an Advisory Committee. In the RSW
component, visiting alumni scientists will serve as role models and offer seminars and workshops to all science
students at UPR-C to broaden their exposure to biomedical research careers and strengthen their science
identity. In the LRS component, 12 sophomore college students will start engaging in research by participating
in scientific literature, learning, and laboratory research activities. In the URE component, the trainees will
engage more extensively in research by participating in an off-campus research project during the summer (24
students) and an on-campus research experience during the academic year. In the QCS component, the
junior/senior students will enhance their skills to analyze and present numerical data, reduce problem complexity,
think in terms of computational algorithmics, and automate tasks computationally within the natural sciences.
The LRS and QCS educational activities use collaborative learning to accommodate differences in preparation
among trainees. The EBT/EBM component will facilitate faculty training in evidence-based teaching and
mentoring using Blended Learning Modules in EBT and Lesson Study cycles. In the EBT/EBM component, the
fundamental aspects of multiple teaching and learning areas will be explored and implemented over one year.
This long-term faculty training program will provide the sustained and lasting efforts required for faculty to change
their teaching practices. These five integrated program components of the U-RISE at UPR-Cayey are designed
to facilitate the completion of baccalaureate degrees and the transition into and completion of biomedical
research-focused higher degree programs."

There is a national need to advance the understanding of hearing in both healthy patients and those with various
causes of hearing loss, which contribute to reduced quality of life and are correlated with much poorer health
outcomes. The objective of this continuing training program is to train the next generation of faculty who will
populate colleges of science, engineering, and health sciences, as well as to send graduates into industry
prepared to work toward creative solutions for treating hearing loss. Specifically, in order to advance auditory
neuroscience training, this graduate training program leverages faculty expertise in both basic hearing science
and technology development, from three Purdue University colleges (Science, Engineering, and Health & Human
Sciences) and 8 doctoral admissions programs. Two types of investigators are included: 10 hearing scientists
with focused research programs related to auditory-system neuroscience, and 12 technology innovators trained
in other disciplines (e.g., biomedical and electrical engineering, computer science). Collectively and
collaboratively, the program expands knowledge about mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, and systems
levels that underlie auditory information processing. This fundamental knowledge can then be applied to better
understand the changes that lead to pathologies of the auditory system due to damage, disease, aging, and
congenital disorders, as well as understanding how hearing evolved and influences behavior and natural
selection. Technological approaches to these questions include, but are not limited to, super-resolution
microscopy, biological implants for neuromodulation, high-resolution four-dimensional calcium imaging deep in
the mammalian brain, optogenetics and robotics (automated patch-clamping) for brain circuit analysis, and
multimodal brain imaging methods, coupled with advanced approaches in statistical and data analysis and model
development. TPAN is unique in that it is specifically designed to serve students with undergraduate degrees in
the disparate disciplines of life science, physical science or engineering, and merge them into a unified cohort
focused on auditory neuroscience. Four fellows are selected for a 2-year term on the training grant, beginning at
the start of their second year. The training curriculum includes 4 core courses (one each in neuroscience, the
auditory periphery, central/behavioral auditory science, and signal processing), a required grant-writing course,
a weekly Hearing Science seminar series where students and faculty present, and yearly attendance at
extramural training courses and/or auditory-neuroscience conferences. Vertical and horizontal mentoring provide
training and support at all levels, to enhance scientific networks, and to foster a sense of community among all
hearing-science students (current and recent TPAN fellows, plus TPAN affiliates) that promotes success in the
PhD and afterwards. Support is provided, in collaboration with Purdue's Institute for Integrative Neuroscience,
for an individual data-management consultant for each Fellow, individually budgeted training-related expenses,
diversity recruiting by both faculty and students, as well as for admininstrative support."
10876910,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Delivery via cesarean section (CS) now makes up roughly one third of all births in the United States.
After CS delivery, newborns experience lower levels of several ‘birth signaling hormones’ such as oxytocin,
vasopressin, and corticosteroids. Birth is a sensitive period for the signaling of these hormones, and so
changes in their levels at birth can affect their regulation throughout development. Besides being involved in
birth, these same hormones also regulate metabolism behavior in later life. We hypothesize this is why delivery
by CS is associated with substantially higher rates of childhood obesity. We have begun to explore the
connections between birth mode and subsequent metabolic regulation using the prairie vole (Microtus
ochrogaster). The prairie vole is one of the few rodent models that allows us to examine the physiology
underlying energy regulation without the burden of chronic cold stress brought on by conventional, room
temperature housing. Our recent findings suggest that prairie voles delivered via CS experience changes in
their thermoregulation, social behavior, and metabolic regulation sufficient to produce increased weight gain
across development. In the present study, we will investigate this further to assess whether voles delivered by
CS are at increased risk for visceral adiposity -one of the most dangerous aspects of obesity in humans. We
will fully characterize subjects’ energy budgets as well as the brain functioning that underlies metabolism in
terms of anatomy, connectivity and the regulation of the birth signaling hormones. Finally, we test whether
replacing the missing hormone surge in CS newborns can avoid the metabolic outcomes typically seen in
children and voles delivered by CS. In so doing, we hope to offer a simple, straightforward, and cost-effective
strategy to reduce childhood obesity in this population. We hypothesize that a CS delivery represents delivery
without the full complement of birth signaling hormones and as such will result differences in
neuroendocrinology and metabolism throughout development."

Action selection computations are at the core of goal-directed behavior. Models of action selection suggest that
appropriate actions are selected through competition between potential choice options. Choice competition is
thought to occur across a multi-regional network that span frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and their downstream
circuits where neuronal population encoding potential choice options mutually inhibit each other to provide
opponent control of choice activity. Yet, how these brain regions interact to mediate this process and the loci of
choice competition remain unresolved. We recently identified a frontal cortico-basal-ganglia-superior colliculus
network responsible for action selection of directional licking during decision-making. Distinct neuronal
populations in this multi-regional network encode opposing choice options for lick direction and exhibit push-pull
dynamics prior to a licking movement, reflecting choice competition. Remarkably, activating or suppressing the
superior colliculus is sufficient to bidirectionally control the push-pull choice competition dynamics within the
network, implicating the superior colliculus as a key network node that can mediate choice competition. These
data suggest a working model in which circuits within frontal cortex and basal ganglia encode competition choice
options and they influence downstream superior colliculus in a topographically confined fashion to drive opponent
control of choice activity for specific actions. Leveraging a suite of recently developed technologies, this proposal
aims to precisely define a mesoscale cortico-basal-ganglia-colliculus network for action selection (Aim 1 and 2)
and directly probe the interactions of frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and superior colliculus to resolve the loci of
choice competition (Aim 3). The outcome will test longstanding theories of action selection and elucidate their
neural circuit implementations."
10840302,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Over 10 million students in the US attend schools with police but no counselor, nurse,
psychologist, or social worker. Yet, more than a third of the low proportion of adolescents who receive the
substance use treatment they need (6%) access it only at school; they are disproportionately Black and low-
income. Schools are thus crucial public health intervention targets for substance use and mental health
treatment, prevention, and health equity therein. But instead, many adolescents experience school as a school-
to-prison pipeline; a set of policies and practices that criminalize adolescents and ensnare them in the legal
system rather than provide support for underlying educational and developmental needs. School-based arrests
increased 300-500% and exclusionary school discipline (suspensions and expulsions) doubled over the past 40
years. Black students are more than three times as likely to be suspended or expelled as white students, all else
equal, and students removed from school are more than twice as likely to be arrested in the same month than
those not removed. Our preliminary evidence suggests that the school-to-prison pipeline is a previously
unidentified population driver of adolescent substance use and mental illness. Moreover, the pipeline coincides
with rises in aggressive community policing in schools’ surrounding communities. However, there is no research
on the public health implications of these intersecting trends. In the proposed R01, we will collaborate with the
New York City Office of School Health (OSH) to quantify relationships between aggressive community policing,
school discipline, and student substance use/mental illness in NYC. We will create a unique geocoded 2000-
2022 dataset linking all police stops/arrests; school- and student-level exclusionary discipline; restricted school-
level Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, other drug use); and OSH’s
database of student health services records (e.g., nurse, counselor visits, referrals to mental health/substance
use treatment). We will (Aim 1) characterize direct and mediated relationships between community policing and
school discipline on school-level and (Aim 2) student-level substance use and mental health outcomes; and test
(Aim 3) whether the intensity of policing around schools modifies the relationship between school discipline and
student substance use/mental health. In all aims, we will test whether structural and institutional racism in policing
and school discipline modify hypothesized relationships. This high-impact project responds to NIDA’s interest in
improving SUD treatment for vulnerable populations in schools and the juvenile justice system, as well as
leveraging data science to improve SUD prevention. Our diverse, interdisciplinary team, led by an early-stage
investigator PI, has expertise in substance use, psychiatric, and social epidemiology; school health; the sociology
of racialized disparities in population health, education, and policing; spatial epidemiology/health geography; and
data science. Findings will be utilized by policymakers and project stakeholders (including city, state, and federal
policymakers) working to end the school-to-prison pipeline and prevent adolescent substance use/mental illness."

Current intensive care unit (ICU) care delivery for acute respiratory failure fails to meet the needs of patients
near the end of life, their families, and their interprofessional ICU teams. Efforts to improve end-of-life ICU care
have focused on communication between families and clinicians. Yet, poor end-of-life outcomes for patients,
families, and ICU teams remain intractable, in part because of the system-level processes and norms that drive
ICU care delivery. Time-limited trials have promise to disrupt system-level drivers of poor quality end-of-life
care and establish processes of care delivery that better support patients, families, and ICU teams. A time-
limited “trial” is an agreement among patients, their surrogate decision makers, and clinicians to attempt life-
sustaining treatment for a predefined period and then re-evaluate its utility. This patient care model was
proposed by palliative care experts to address prognostic uncertainty, and navigate competing desires
simultaneously held by many patients—to extend life when possible and to avoid prolonged life-sustaining
treatment if the chance of recovery is low. Time-limited trials have been described in the literature, endorsed by
palliative and critical care professional societies, and are currently used in ICU practice. Yet, time-limited trials
remain poorly formalized in practice with little evidence to guide ICU clinicians in how to conduct trials.
The central objective of this study is to define the optimal care delivery processes of a time-limited trial in acute
respiratory failure. This application responds to NHLBI’s Notice of Special Interest in Palliative Care (NOT-HL-
20-737), including the focus on models of ICU-based palliative care for acute respiratory failure and on how
ICU structure and culture influence palliative care delivery. This project is a sequential mixed methods,
prospective observational study in five ICUs where time-limited trials are currently used. In Aim 1, focused
ethnography of 50 time-limited trials in patients with acute respiratory failure will be used to map current
processes of time-limited trial care delivery for patients with acute respiratory failure. In Aim 2, a prospective,
observational cohort study in 5,810 patients with acute respiratory failure will be used to elucidate the
relationships between time-limited trial processes and end-of-life outcomes for patients, surrogates, and ICU
teams. Aims 2a and 2b will test whether time-limited trial processes are associated with better end-of-life
outcomes and Aim 2c will characterize mechanisms by which processes influence end-of-life outcomes.
This work will transform time-limited trials from a promising model into a clearly defined and optimized care
delivery process. This process will be immediately actionable to guide frontline ICU teams currently using or
considering time-limited trials. This study will also establish the necessary foundation for the design and testing
of complex health interventions that support time-limited trials and safeguard against unintended harms."
10756572,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background: Children with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) experience significant morbidity due to
inadequate pulmonary blood flow from insufficient pulmonary vascular development. Options to diagnose and
treat this pathologic pulmonary vascular development remain limited. Endothelin-1 (ET1) and both arginine/nitric
oxide (NO) and tryptophan metabolites have been linked to pathologic pulmonary vascular development.
Preliminary data from our group demonstrate alterations in circulating ET1, arginine metabolites, and tryptophan
metabolites at the time of Stage 2 palliation. Persistence of these pathway abnormalities between Stage 2 and
Stage 3 palliation and their association with outcomes have not been studied.
Hypothesis: Increased ET1 and dysregulation of the arginine/NO and tryptophan pathways in SVHD patients
undergoing staged palliation disrupts pulmonary vascular development, leading to decreased pulmonary blood
flow, worsened hypoxemia, and cardiorespiratory morbidities during the critical pre-Stage 3 growth years, the
immediate post-operative period, and throughout childhood.
Aims: Quantify serum concentrations of ET1, arginine/NO metabolites, and tryptophan metabolites in SVHD
subjects immediately prior to and following both Stage 2 and Stage 3 palliation, and at the time of post-Fontan
cardiac MRI to: 1) determine the association between biomarker abnormalities at Stage 2, persistent pathway
changes at Stage 3, and pulmonary vascular growth by Stage 3, 2) evaluate the association between biomarker
abnormalities at Stage 3, pulmonary vascular adequacy for the Stage 3 operation, and post-operative
complications, and 3) determine the relationship between a pro-angiogenic metabolic signature, changes in
aorto-pulmonary collateral burden, and altered pulmonary arterial flow dynamics before and after Stage 3.
Methods: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study in children undergoing staged SVHD palliation combined with
a cross-sectional study of older SVHD patients.
Impact: 1) First longitudinal study of ET1 exposure early in SVHD palliation to support future development of
ET1 as a clinical diagnostic test and biomarker-directed clinical trials of ET1 receptor antagonist. 2) First
comprehensive pathway mapping of arginine/NO and tryptophan metabolism as markers of pathologic
pulmonary vascular development in CHD. 3) Novel metabolomic approach to understanding AP collateral
phenotype and identification of new markers of disease/potential therapeutic targets.
Career Development: The proposed study will allow me to gain the data, skills, experience, and publications
needed to support my transition to independent research. I will augment this with a Master of Science degree in
the Clinical Sciences (MSCS) specifically targeting advanced data analysis and clinical trial design. Combined,
these development aims will position me to achieve my goal of becoming an R01 funded expert in pulmonary
vascular development in children with congenital heart disease."
10813880,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable autism spectrum disorder and is associated with
auditory features such as hypersensitivity to sound (hyperacusis). FXS is caused by the absence of Fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is known to bind specific mRNAs and repress their translation. Little
is known about how FMRP impacts the central auditory pathway. We will study FMRP effects on gene
expression in the auditory brainstem, using the well-established fmr1-knockout (KO) mouse model, which
exhibits auditory hypersensitivity and seizures in response to loud noise. Although the well-established role of
FMRP is translational repression, it has been shown recently in neurons that FMRP can also change the level
of many mRNAs. Whether this occurs in the auditory brainstem is unknown. We have novel transcriptome data
(unpublished) showing that the levels of many mRNAs that are known to be bound by FMRP, and to function in
synaptic pathways, are decreased in the fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. How this occurs is not known. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that direct FMRP binding stabilizes the bound mRNA, but in the absence of FMRP, these
mRNAs have decreased stability (and, therefore, decreased level). We will also determine if decreased
stabilization of mRNA leads to decreased protein level or if it is offset by the loss of FMRP-mediated
translational repression so as to manifest as increased protein level. Another possibility is that FMRP acts
indirectly through translational repression of factors, such nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor,
UPF1. Unpublished data from my research mentor’s lab has shown that induced pluripotent stem cells derived
from FXS-patient fibroblasts manifest an abnormally high level of UPF1 (whose mRNA is bound by FMRP),
resulting in hyperactivated NMD and, as a consequence, reduced levels of cellular NMD target mRNAs. Based
on these data, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that NMD is hyperactivated in fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus, leading
to gene downregulation. Lastly, it is known that FMRP is involved in activity dependent processes. For
example, dendritic localization of FMRP is increased with glutamatergic signaling and loss of afferent activity
can blunt translational repression by FMRP. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the FMRP effects on gene
expression are dependent on afferent activity. We will examine an inducible deafness mouse model to
determine if it can phenocopy the fmr1-KO, indicating that afferent activity is required for FMRP function. The
PI has extensive molecular biology experience, and with the guidance of a primary mentor who is a respected
RNA biologist. The PI will master current RNA techniques and work towards becoming an independent
investigator. Results will reveal how FMRP regulates genes important for auditory development and plasticity.
The ultimate goal is to reveal potential therapeutic targets to treat auditory hypersensitivity and processing
disorders. The mechanism leading to hyperacusis is poorly understood, and because it is not limited to FXS
and affects up to 15% of the population, the study is relevant to the general population."
10798202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of melanoma has doubled in the last three decades and is projected to exceed 100,000 cases in
the US in 2020. Almost 7,000 people died of melanoma in the US in 2019. Melanoma has a strong propensity
to spread both via lymphatic and hematogenous routes. The most common sites of metastasis include lymph
nodes, lung, liver and brain. Although novel therapies, such as immunotherapies have improved survival of
patients with metastatic disease, metastatic patterns can influence responses to such therapies. In particular,
patients with metastases to the liver have a lower response and survival rates in response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors compared to patients with metastases to other organs. The molecular underpinnings of liver metastasis
development and the impact on drug response and resistance are poorly understood. This is in part due to limited
pre-clinical models that resembles metastatic patterns seen in patients, and a sparsity of genomic
characterization of human liver metastatic lesions. The goal of this proposal is to determine drivers of melanoma
liver metastasis (MLM) and mechanisms of associated resistance to immunotherapies. For this purpose, we
characterized and used a novel syngeneic mouse model that faithfully recapitulates genomic, metastatic and
response patterns seen in patients. We performed a large-scale in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified
perturbations that promote development of MLM, but not primary tumor growth or metastasis to other organ
sites. In the first aim of this proposal, we elucidate the cell intrinsic signaling mechanisms promoting MLM. Next,
using integrated high-plex imaging, immune-profiling and single-cell sequencing, we determine the immune
infiltrates of MLM and concurrent lung metastases and how the immune compartment impacts the response to
clinically used immunotherapies. Finally, we assembled a large cohort of patient biopsies from liver metastases
and concurrent metastases from other organ sites as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for
genomic and immune profiling. Together, these studies will provide a landscape of genomic determinants,
signaling mechanisms and immune environments of MLM and their impact on responses to immunotherapies
and have the potential to identify novel avenues for rationale drug development."
10831397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goal of this project is to determine how morphogens control organ growth. During development, each
body part grows to full size and differentiates complex cell patterns under the control of morphogens, secreted
signaling molecules that spread through developing tissues and organize gene expression, pattern and growth.
The major superfamilies of morphogens are conserved in all multicellular animals, from sponges to man.
Understanding how they work has enormous implications for human health, as genetic and environmental
perturbations of their activities and signal transduction pathways cause diverse developmental and physiological
disorders as well as a wide range of cancers. Research on morphogens is thus critical for developing diagnostic
and therapeutic tools to treat human disease, a central mission of the NIH. Our past studies, using Drosophila,
established that members of two superfamilies of secreted proteins, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and
Wingless/Ints (Wnts) function as bona fide morphogens. Initially we focused on the logic and molecular
mechanisms by which these molecules control gene expression and patterning. Here we turn to the fundamental
and enduring mystery of how they control growth. In the proposed research, we will fill three key gaps in
understanding. First, we will consolidate and extend a new “feed-forward” model for growth based on our recent
discoveries unifying the roles of Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg) in the developing Drosophila
wing, a classic paradigm for morphogen action. In this model, Wg and Dpp act together to induce and sustain
expression of the selector gene, vestigial (vg), which encodes a transcription factor that “selects” the wing state
and programs wing cells to grow in response to Wg and Dpp. We identified a single enhancer element in
the vg gene that integrates Dpp and Wg input, as well as a “recruitment” signal, the protocadherin Fat. We will
now combine genetic, transgenic and molecular approaches to determine how this integration occurs and to
identify downstream effectors that govern wing growth in response to Dpp and Wg. We will also test a key axiom
of the model—that Dpp and Wg are required continuously, at long-range, to sustain growth—and determine how
these molecules move through tissue. Second, we will apply the approaches and principles that have emerged
from our analysis of the fly wing to elucidate how Dpp and Wg control the growth of other organs. We will focus
on the fly leg in which Dpp and Wg as well as their downstream selector genes and signaling molecules are
deployed in a manner that is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, but distinct from the wing. Our
analysis will build on our preliminary evidence that leg growth is governed by the ranges of Dpp and Wg—as in
the wing—but by different regulatory circuits and logic. Third, we will determine the role of receptor dimerization
or higher order oligomerization in Wg reception by Frizzled (Fz) family GPCRs based on our discovery of
unexpected functional complementation between three of the four Drosophila Fz proteins. This analysis should
provide insight into how Wnts are transduced by the ten Fz proteins in humans."

Biological membranes create compartments within cells and demarcate the outsides of cells from their insides.
Beyond their role as physical barriers, lipid membranes also are used as platforms to organize biological
processes essential for life: Membrane surfaces are unique for the exceptional ability to coalesce, organize, and
regulate biological complexes necessary to transmit information between cells and among cellular
compartments. Certain of these biological complexes are core nodes that coordinate diverse inputs into
conserved outputs. One such core node is organized and orchestrated by the phospholipase C gamma (PLC-)
isozymes in response to diverse transmembrane receptors including a host of receptor tyrosine kinases and
immune receptors. We will study this core node as a “Rosetta Stone” to learn the inherent and emergent
properties of signaling at biological membranes. By systematically and quantitatively comparing how properties
of this core node and associated cellular responses are altered for different classes of input receptors and in
different cell types, we will derive fundamental and guiding principles about how cells and tissues execute precise
signaling within the physical-chemical constraints of their biological membranes. This goal will be accomplished
using a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary approach: Detailed structural, biophysical, and biochemical
studies of purified proteins and complexes will guide complementary studies of reconstituted nodes on self-
assembled lipid bilayers or re-engineered in cells to be controlled and imaged with light. Data from these studies
will inform computational models based on a newly-developed frameworks describing core nodes operating at
membranes that will be used to predict signaling kinetics, efficiency, and dynamics in response to changes in
core components, inputs, and feedback regulation. Together, these studies will reveal critical insights into the
function and regulation of the PLC- isozymes downstream of multiple receptor types. These studies will also
advance our overall goal of a deeper, yet more parsimonious, understanding of signaling at biological
membranes."
10929300,"Project Summary
My research takes a unique approach in which the development of next-generation microscopy methods
progresses in parallel with fundamental discoveries in cell biology. On the method-development front, besides
earlier success in achieving sub-10 nm resolution for super-resolution microscopy, my recent work has
pioneered the concept of multidimensional and multifunctional super-resolution microscopy, in which
intracellular functional parameters, including local chemical polarity, pH, diffusivity, and protein activity, are
mapped out at nanometer resolution and single-molecule sensitivity. Empowered by such capabilities, my lab
has been highly successful in unveiling hidden subcellular structures and processes, as well as their underlying
biophysical rules, for diverse systems ranging from the mammalian cytoskeleton, intracellular transport,
organelle morphology and biogenesis, to membrane biology. Our future research continues to push forward the
synergy between method development and biological discoveries. Major directions include charge-modulated
protein interactions and effects on diffusion inside the organelle lumen, superdiffusion and subdiffusion in the
living cell, organelle pH dynamics and role in protein trafficking, and the structure and physical properties of the
ER exit site in relationship with the biogenesis of transport carriers. Moreover, by integrating super-resolution
microscopy with FIB-SEM, we will obtain holistic pictures of the unusually thin tubular organelles we recently
discovered and further substantiate their functions and biogenesis. Separately, we are developing a new tool,
single-molecule electrophoresis microscopy, to quantify protein charge states at the super-resolution level.
Together, through the continued development of empowering microscopy tools and their tactical application to
fundamental biological questions, we will continue shifting the paradigms of how we understand the complex,
dynamic behavior of the cell."
10818420,"Program Summary
Our research is aimed at understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the faithful
inheritance eukaryotic chromosomes. Our primary focus is on elucidating the events required for the orderly
segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, the crucial process by which diploid germ cells
generate haploid gametes. These events are of central importance to sexually reproducing organisms, since
failure to execute them correctly leads to chromosomal aneuploidy, one of the leading causes of miscarriages
and birth defects in humans. During meiotic prophase, chromosomes undergo a dramatic and dynamic program
of structural reorganization in preparation for the meiotic divisions. Moreover, chromosome inheritance during
meiosis relies on the formation of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and repair of a subset of these DSBs as
inter-homolog crossovers (COs). Because the DSBs that serve as the initiating events of meiotic recombination
pose a danger to genome integrity, the success of genome inheritance during meiosis requires cells to maintain
a balance between the beneficial effects of COs and the potential harmful consequences of the process by which
they are generated. A major goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms that operate during meiosis
to achieve this crucial balance. An inter-related goal is to understand how meiosis-specific chromosome
organization is established, maintained, and remodeled to bring about successful segregation of homologous
chromosomes. We are approaching these issues using Caenorhabditis nematodes, simple metazoan organisms
that are especially amenable to an integrated application of powerful cytological, genetic, genomic, and
biochemical approaches, and in which the events under study are particularly accessible. Our goal under the
MIRA program is to pursue a systems-level understanding of meiosis, based on the recognition that multiple
distinct aspects of the meiotic program are intimately interconnected, and that robustness of the system is an
emergent property of this interconnectedness. Our approach will build on recent technical advances and new
discoveries in the well-established C. elegans experimental system, in combination with opportunities afforded
by a newly-introduced Caenorhabditis interspecies hybrid model, to interrogate the meiotic program at multiple
levels. Planned areas of investigation will include: Elucidating mechanisms that ensure reliable formation of CO-
based connections for all chromosome pairs; Exploring how different events and developmental transitions in
the meiotic program are temporally and spatially coordinated; Investigating the functional organization of
meiosis-specific chromosome structures that promote and regulate meiotic recombination and enable
chromosomes to sense and respond to events occurring at distant positions; Pursuing a new approach aimed at
understanding the fundamental basis of homolog recognition."
10834172,"SUMMARY: My lab studies circadian-regulated processes and their contributions to health and disease.
Circadian regulation refers to daily oscillations in biological functions and is an evolutionarily conserved feature
from bacteria to humans. At its core, circadian regulation is governed by a transcriptional negative feedback
loop called the circadian clock. Circadian clocks generate 24-hour oscillations in the expression of hundreds of
genes in almost every tissue examined and drive the daily oscillation of cellular, tissue-specific, and behavioral
functions. Chronic disruption of circadian regulation due to jetlag or night-shift work is associated with multiple
defects in innate immunity, metabolism, and sleep. Many disease states are also associated with loss of
circadian regulation, including bacterial infection, metabolic diseases, and neurological diseases. Despite the
known profound effects of loss of circadian regulation on human physiology, a major gap in knowledge is the
identification of circadian-regulated functions that contribute to the pathogenesis of specific diseases.
 In the last funding period, our MIRA supported the development of tools to enhance or inhibit Drosophila
circadian clocks; the investigation of glial function in both Drosophila and mice; and the investigation of a core
function for sleep in Drosophila. In the current proposal, we focus on circadian-regulated metabolism, which has
emerged as a major theme in our work. We describe two projects involving circadian-regulated metabolism in
Drosophila: sensitivity to oxidative stress due to chronic short sleep (Project 1) and metabolic regulation of host
tolerance of bacterial infection (Project 2).
· Project 1: One of the most obvious manifestations of circadian rhythm is sleep. Sleep, or obligate rest
 during the 24-hour circadian cycle, is evolutionarily conserved. Yet the physiological function of sleep
 remains unclear. Our published MIRA-funded results support the hypothesis that a key function of sleep is
 defense against oxidative stress. Our more recent preliminary data suggest that chronic short sleep causes
sensitivity to oxidative stress due to underlying changes in metabolism. We will investigate this in Project 1.
· Project 2: There are two types of defense mechanisms against infection: resistance and tolerance.
Resistance mechanisms kill pathogens, while tolerance mechanisms limit the pathogenic effects of infection.
Tolerance is much less well understood than resistance. In NIGMS-funded research, my lab previously
identified a circadian-regulated, TORC2-mediated mechanism of host tolerance against B. cepacia infection.
In preliminary data, we found that Sting mutants also have increased tolerance against B. cepacia infection.
The Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is a conserved innate immune response and known
resistance mechanism. STING also has a second distinct function in both mammals and Drosophila:
regulation of lipid metabolism. We will investigate whether STING’s roles in immunity and metabolism
intersect during infection in Project 2."
10842452,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and
higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women
and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s
criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant
proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months,
increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse
health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV
treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide
a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV
recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and
microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV,
and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI
functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic
community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes
associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that
BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria.
This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal
Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be
assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune
markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an
epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ
supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers
of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women
with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are
women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training
in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long-
term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome
to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of
Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of
this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator."
10835895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Caspases are cysteine proteases that control apoptotic cell death. Caspases are activated to kill cancerous
cells, but inhibiting caspases can prevent deleterious cell death in diseases like heart attack and stroke. Thus,
there has been significant interest in caspases as drug targets. This interest heightened further with the finding
that caspase-6 plays a central role in neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, no caspase-directed therapies are
on the market, primarily because research has focused on the active site, the most conserved region of the
family. It is clear that each caspase is regulated in a unique manner. A comprehensive understanding of which
is essential to achieve caspase-specific inhibition. Thus, our long-term project goal has been to define and
exploit unique regulatory features for each apoptotic caspase.
Our pursuit of that goal has been successful. Due to our understanding of the unique features of each apop-
totic caspase, we developed an allosteric caspase-6 inhibitor that is more potent than any reported (33 nM)
and is also by far the most selective, preferring caspase-6 500-fold or more over all other caspases. This
selectivity was possible because the allosteric site we targeted is unique to caspase-6, locking it into a helical
conformation not attainable by any other caspase. It is gratifying that our intense and systematic study of
caspase regulation - cleavage state, conformational change, zinc binding and phosphorylation - culminated
in a structural understanding that enabled us to meet our goal of caspase-selective allosteric inhibition. Thus,
we propose research that will further extend our understanding of the regulation of the apoptotic caspases in
new key areas - substrate selectivity by caspase isoforms, core unfolding and aggregation of caspase-9 by
phosphorylation, and interactions between caspase core and prodomains to achieve substrate selection. In
addition, we are currently moving this caspase-6 inhibitor forward toward clinical use.
While we are thrilled at the success of developing an inhibitor that can block the function of just one of the
twelve human caspases, the substrate-selective inhibitors proposed here promise to be even more invaluable.
For example, preventing caspase-6 cleavage of Tau would have a major impact on preventing the formation
of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s Disease. On the other hand, cleavage of DJ-1 (PARK7) by caspase-
6 is important for preventing Parkinson’s Disease. Thus, an ideal caspase-6 inhibitor for treatment of Alz-
heimer’s disease would block Tau cleavage, but would still cleave apoptotic substrates and DJ-1, without
promoting cancer or Parkinson’s disease. The proposed studies identifying exosites for Tau and DJ-1 will
enable us to develop substrate-selective inhibitors (nanobodies) that can block cleavage of Tau, but not of
DJ-1. Together this work plan increases both our fundamental understanding of the biology and regulation of
caspases and enables development of a novel highly tuned class of caspase-directed therapies."
10843104,"Inflammasomes sense an array of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) generated during infection and trauma and
represent the first line of defense against infections. In the canonical form, inflammasomes consist
of a sensor protein that recognizes PAMPs, an adaptor molecule ASC, and an effector protease,
caspase-1. In the noncanonical form, inflammatory caspases related to caspase-1, namely
caspase-11 and caspase-4, directly sense cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-
negative bacteria and their outer membrane vesicle. Inflammasome signaling culminates in the
post-translational activation of IL-1β, IL-18, gasdermin D (a pore-forming protein), and pyroptosis,
a lytic and inflammatory form of cell death, and the simultaneous release of DAMPs. Despite the
profound implications of inflammasome responses in infections, cancer, and autoimmunity, the
regulatory modules that fine-tune the initiation and termination of inflammasome signaling remain
mostly unknown. This proposal seeks to comprehensively address this critical knowledge gap in
three specific aims by focusing on galectins, a family of β-galactoside-binding proteins. Owing to
their capacity to bind to N- or O-glycan termini of various glycoproteins and regulate their
membrane localization and signal transduction, galectins have diverse functions in various
physiological and pathological processes. Aims 1 and 2 of the proposal will investigate galectins'
role in noncanonical inflammasome signaling in murine and human cells and in vivo. Aim 3 will
explore how galectins control canonical inflammasome signaling in vitro and in vivo. In summary,
the findings from this project would reveal new players in inflammasome signaling with significant
implications for human infectious diseases and sepsis."
10850563,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Integration of the jaw with the surrounding musculature is essential for speech and mastication. A
fundamental step in jaw integration begins in development, with formation of stable tendon-bone attachments
that are zonally organized into tendon, fibrocartilage, mineralized fibrocartilage, and bone. The gradient of
skeletogenic cell types within the attachment arises from attachment progenitors (APs) that, through unclear
mechanisms, interpret chondrogenic versus tenogenic signaling to acquire distinct cell fates along the tendon-
bone axis. Even less is known about APs of the jaw which, unlike their counterparts in the limb and trunk, are
derived from neural crest cells (NCC). This study tests the idea that jaw APs differentiate into a gradient of
skeletogenic cell types through a series of binary switches that are regulated by an NCC-specific mechanism.
We have found that jaw APs express graded levels of Scx, Runx2, and Sox9 depending on their position along
the tendon-bone axis. We also found that during AP differentiation a novel intermediate Scx+/Runx2+
population emerges. In Runx2+/- mice this intermediate population fails to form, and APs differentiate into
tendon over cartilage/bone. While this suggests that tripotent APs differentiate through lineage-restricted
intermediates, how APs spatially interpret signals for tendon vs. cartilage/bone to make these cell fate
decisions and whether APs always choose between one fate or the other (e.g. tenocyte vs. osteoblast) or acquire
hybrid properties (e.g. osteofibrogenic) is unknown. We recently showed that an Fgf-Notch signaling axis is
regionally deployed along the tendon-bone interface and promotes AP differentiation into tendon over
cartilage/bone. This mechanism appears NCC-specific, as loss of Fgfr2 in mesoderm-derived APs does not
alter limb attachment development. In this study, we use mouse genetics along with cutting-edge genomics to
test that, during AP differentiation, integration of Fgf and Notch signaling promotes tendon cell fate in a series
of binary switches by regulating levels of Scx, Runx2, and Sox9 transcription. In Aim1 we will use clonal lineage
tracing and scRNA-seq to determine the lineage relationship between APs and the skeletogenic cells in the
tendon-bone attachment. In Aim2, we will use conditional mouse genetics to determine how differences in
Notch signal strength along the tendon-bone axis alter AP cell fate decisions. In Aim3, we will use a
combination of mouse genetics and CUT&RUN-seq to test that Erk signaling integrates Fgf and Notch
signaling through linear and parallel mechanisms. In the linear mechanism, Erk activates Notch2 signaling by
initiating Dll1 expression. In the parallel mechanism, Erk and Notch2 independently activate the same
downstream targets genes for tendon fate including Scx. Completion of these aims will reveal a developmental
mechanism that establishes a gradient of skeletogenic cell types in tendon-bone attachments of the jaw.
Knowledge gained will guide future developmentally inspired strategies for jaw attachment repair and may
inform how jaw abnormalities develop in the FGFR2-and NOTCH2- related congenital disorders."

Undertaking innovative cancer research requires input from teams of scientists with a mixture of backgrounds,
including molecular biology, oncology, medicine, epidemiology, biostatistics, genomics/genetics,
bioinformatics, computer science and artificial intelligence. Researchers with interdisciplinary training across
these fields are extremely valuable to such teams, as they can act as conduits for the integrated work
necessary to accomplish some of the most promising and forward-looking cancer research. Due to the
exclusive nature of training within these fields, however, there are limited opportunities for investigators to
obtain the knowledge that bridges these disciplines. To help remedy this problem, we propose here the
continuation of this T32 program to provide postdoctoral training in the Computational Genomic Epidemiology
of Cancer (CoGEC) at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center. The CoGEC training program defines a novel,
transdisciplinary area of training at the intersection of cancer research, epidemiology, biostatistics, genetics,
and computer science. The program’s structure is defined by three key requirements. First, all trainees will
have the opportunity to take a specialized core curriculum of five courses to fill in the gaps of their previous
training if necessary. Second, the trainees will undertake additional didactic experiences selected to
complement their educational and research background. Third, all trainees will obtain research experience by
collaborating with multiple mentors on high-level computational genomic epidemiology of cancer projects. As
an extension of this research experience, each trainee will be required to write and defend an NIH grant
proposal. Cancer researchers obtaining training in this program will have the skills vital to deciphering the
complex pathways comprising genetic and environmental risk factors for disease. In doing so, their knowledge
and findings will be translated into improved cancer understanding, prevention and treatment."
10781968,"Summary:
 Properly allocating metabolic resources is crucial for mounting energetically costly T cell mediated-immune
responses. In addition, cellular metabolic programs interact with cell-surface receptor signaling pathways by
providing metabolites as ligands. This proposal aims to understand the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in
regulating T cell inflammation and explore the potential therapeutic value of targeting GABA in animal models of
inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. An integrated analysis of the extracellular metabolome, stable isotope
traced metabolic pathway analysis, and metabolic transcriptome revealed that GABA is one of the most abundant
metabolites produced through glutamine and arginine catabolism in CD4+ T effector cells. Expressing 4-amino-
butyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) funnels GABA as an anaplerotic substrate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle to
maximize carbon allocation in promoting TH17 cell differentiation. By contrast, the absence of ABAT activities in
iTreg cells enables GABA exporting to the extracellular environment and acting as an autocrine signaling metab-
olite to suppress T cell inflammation. Accordingly, genetically or pharmacologically ablating ABAT activity in T
cells suppresses inflammation in vivo. Conversely, genetically ablating GABA(A) receptor in T cells deteriorates
inflammatory responses.
 Hence, we hypothesize that GABA functions as a metabolic and signaling gatekeeper in coordinating carbon
assimilation and receptor signaling response to governing CD4 T effector cell proliferation and inflammatory
response. The aims of this proposal are to 1) decipher the molecular and signaling mechanisms that control
GABA metabolism in T cells; 2) determine the outcomes of modulating GABA metabolism and receptor signaling
in regulating the effector function of T cells; 3) develop and test complementary enzymatic, genetic, and meta-
bolic strategies to modulate inflammatory response and autoimmunity in animal models of multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis. Collectively, the expected outcomes of this project are significant as it will reveal the funda-
mental principles of the emerging connections between cell metabolism, immune signaling, and T cell differenti-
ation. These studies are critical to developing novel approaches and therapeutic interventions that improve clin-
ical outcomes of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."
10839841,"Abstract
Mammalian G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a vast array of biological responses and have been
implicated in numerous diseases. GPCRs are highly druggable and the target of about one-third of all FDA
approved drugs. Currently, all drugs targeting GPCRs have been developed to modulate signals transduced at
the plasma membrane. However, we and others have shown that GPCRs remain active inside the cell and signal
from endosomes. The orchestration of GPCR signaling from the plasma membrane and endosomes is essential
for achieving proper cellular responses, dysregulation of these pathways, through either aberrant increases or
decreases in signaling drives disease progression. Our laboratory has long focused on understanding the
regulatory mechanisms that control GPCR signaling. In recent projects funded by MIRA, we discovered that
ubiquitination of a subset of GPCRs drives p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) endosomal signaling
and vascular inflammation. The molecular mechanisms by which key regulators and mediators of ubiquitination
regulate GPCR-p38 endosomal signaling is not known and a gap in knowledge. In the next 5 years, our
laboratory will focus on understanding how two key deubiquitinases regulate GPCR-stimulated p38 signaling by
identifying key substrates and elucidating the mechanisms of regulation and function in vascular inflammation.
We also discovered that the α-arrestin arrestin-related domain containing protein-3 (ARRDC3) is an endosomal
multi-functional adaptor protein that controls GPCR signaling and trafficking via distinct mechanisms in projects
funded by MIRA. Unlike classical arrestins, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms that regulate α-
arrestin activity and how α-arrestins govern mammalian GPCR function and a major gap in knowledge. In the
next 5 years, we will define the molecular mechanisms that control GPCR-stimulated ARRDC3 activity and
elucidate the mechanisms of regulation and function in cancer progression. We will integrate hypothesis-driven
and unbiased systems approaches to interrogate the mechanisms that control ubiquitin-driven GPCR endosomal
signaling and ARRDC3 activity and function utilizing innovative and cutting-edge technologies. A thorough
understanding of the spatial-temporal regulatory mechanisms that control GPCR signaling is critical for improving
the development of novel drugs targeting GPCRs."

 The fundamental objective of our Trauma Research Center Training Program is to inspire the next
generation of surgical trainees to pursue a career that includes basic science and translational
investigation. At a time when surgical scientists are becoming rare, this training grant is critical to maintain the
participation of clinically active surgeons in basic research. While our Center’s primary focus is Trauma-Induced
Coagulopathy and Inflammation, we believe the diversity of opportunities within our Program, and general
applicability of the coagulation/inflammation process to other disciplines, ensures relevance to any surgical
trainee. Our secondary objective is to recruit capable surgeons to the field of academic trauma surgery in which
lack of research has become a national crisis. Trauma remains the leading cause of death in the US for
individuals younger than 46 years of age with bleeding the primary cause of these preventable deaths.
Hence the need for basic and translational investigation in this area is essential and remains our inspiration.
 The design of our Program is a two-year full-time commitment to basic investigation conducted
primarily in well-established surgical research laboratories within the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical
Campus, supplemented by patient data generated from prospective clinical studies at our regional Level I Ernest
E Moore Shock Trauma Center at Denver Health. Experimental work will focus on the mechanisms disrupting
coagulation-inflammatory homeostasis, and includes investigation with proteomics, metabolomics, and
genomics.
 The major funding for this basic research will be the 1RM1GM13968 “Resuscitation Strategies for
Achieving Thrombo-inflammation Homeostasis” funded by NIGMS, UM1HL120877 TACTIC funded by NHLBI,
and DOD-W81XWH – 12-2-0028 “Acute Coagulopathy of Trauma” funded by the Department of Defense.
Clinical studies will be funded dominantly by the DOD W81XWH–12-2-0028 W81XWH-16-D-0024 “Linking
Investigation in Trauma and Emergency Service Clinical Research Network” (LITES) as well as a number of
institution and industry supported trials. The surgical research fellows will commence participation in the
Program after the second or third year of general surgery residency (PGY 2 or 3) for two consecutive years.
We encourage pursuit of advanced degrees, e.g. MS, MPH, and PhD, with training in the School of Graduate
Medical Education.
 As in the past, we are requesting funding for four positions annually, sequenced so that first and second

with obesity have ~1/2 the risk of CHD as obese men. The risk of CHD goes up with menopause, but by
mechanisms distinct from obese men. The protection conferred by estrogen signaling in females is lost with
diabetes due to undefined mechanisms. The liver plays an important part in estrogen-regulated metabolism. Our
goal is to therapeutically target the beneficial hepatic actions of estrogens in males and females and discover
the mechanisms by which diabetes interacts with liver estrogen signaling to put females at high CHD risk.
 In the last funding cycle of this project, we used mouse models and metabolic tracers to discover that estrogen
signaling through hepatic estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) protects against several key aspects of obesity-
associated metabolic disease. We showed that, 1) whole body and liver insulin sensitivity are improved; 2) fatty
liver is diminished by increasing fatty acid oxidation and increasing liver VLDL output; 3) atherosclerosis is
reduced by improving HDL’s cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory properties, and by increasing liver
cholesterol delivery (reverse cholesterol transport). While examining the pathways by which hepatic ERa confers
protection for females, we made the surprising observation that it has protective effects in obese males also.
Hepatic ERa in males, 1) decreases liver fat; 2) improves liver and whole-body insulin sensitivity; 3) improves
HDL cholesterol efflux capacity. The goal of AIM1 is to amplify the beneficial effects of the hepatic ERa in male
and female mice by defining approaches to therapeutically target estrogen signaling in the liver.
 Diabetic women have the same elevated CHD risk as diabetic men. We found that hyperglycemia induces
hepatic stress, negating the benefit of hepatic estrogen signaling. Whether hyperglycemia or some aspect of
glycemic control is the mechanism by which diabetes negates the protective effect of being female remains to
be determined. We will explore mechanisms for this important biology in AIM2. Our overarching hypothesis is
that targeted hepatic estrogen signaling will benefit glucose metabolism, fatty liver, HDL function, and
atherosclerosis in obese males and females. In contrast, hyperglycemia leads to accumulation of liver glucose
metabolites that activate Carbohydrate Response Element Binding Protein and counters the benefits of ERa.
 Our hypothesis is innovative because we propose that targeting ERa in hepatocytes will limit many aspects
of obesity-associated disease in both females and males without unfavorable estrogen actions on other tissues.
We will also define a critical mechanism for the sex-specific impact of diabetes on CHD risk factors in females.
 Our techniques are innovative because we are applying isotopic tracers and tissue-targeted, sex-based,
therapeutics to distinguish estradiol action and glucose metabolism at the liver from profound whole-body effects.
 Our studies are significant because we will use knowledge of sex differences physiology to develop targeted
treatments that benefit both sexes. We will define a pathway that links diabetes to severe outcomes in women."
10845616,"ABSTRACT
Diversification of our immune system requires two primary DNA recombination pathways: V(D)J and class
switch recombination (CSR). Both V(D)J and CSR have several poorly understood intermediate steps. These
intermediate steps are the basis for the most disease-relevant aspects of these pathways because they are
inherently unstable. Static structural biology approaches alone are not sufficient to understand the instability of
these intermediates. The dynamic approaches described here permit us to understand these unstable
intermediates that are key to both inherited and acquired (neoplastic) diseases of the V(D)J and CSR pathways.
From an applied standpoint, the understanding gained in this proposal positions us to eventually use
biochemical systems to generate improved antibodies against pathogenic viruses and bacteria. Important for
the current proposal, over 85% of human lymphoid malignancies are B cell in nature, and we have shown that
the breakage phase at the two chromosomes arises by a confluence of failures in the V(D)J and Ig CSR
mechanisms. The chromosome break at the immunoglobulin locus is typically due to failures during the
synapsis steps as the RAG complex prematurely releases the ends. Failures can also occur in the RAG hand-
off to the NHEJ pathway (for joining the ends). We study all of these aspects of RAG function in this proposal.
The other chromosome break arises due to the off-target behavior of the CSR enzyme called activation-induced
deaminase (AID), which we study in the second Project of this proposal. The Lieber lab has done key
biochemistry on all of the enzymes mentioned above. We are the first and only lab to reconstitute the entire
V(D)J pathway using fully purified enzymes. Despite beautiful recent atomic structures of RAG and AID
proteins, the dynamic action of these enzymes and how they fail is the gap that remains. In addition to
neoplasms, diseases caused by RAG and AID enzymes are responsible for over one-third of inherited human
immune deficiencies called SCID. My lab has used the current funding period to develop in-lab capability to use
our unique purified proteins for V(D)J and CSR in high resolution single molecule assays, specifically cryo-EM
and sm-FRET. In 2019 and 2020, we published the first sm-FRET in which not only the proteins but also the
dynamic sm-FRET were done in my lab. My lab also now has full cryo-EM abilities, which would be relevant at
the later stages of the current proposal. We also can carry out the relevant biochemical steps in this proposal
on mono- and polynucleosomal substrates in addition to naked DNA. In Project 1, we dissect the key vulnerable
points in the RAG synapsis steps and their hand-off to the NHEJ pathway. In Project 2, we study the
independent process of Ig class switch recombination (CSR). The Lieber lab was the first to discover kilobase
length chromosomal R-loops at switch sequences. We are the only lab able to reconstitute the entire CSR
pathway using purified substrates and proteins. We apply our cumulative technologies to ask key questions
about how CSR occurs and how it fails in disease states."
10874398,"Hearing loss affects over 28 million Americans and is the second most common disability in the Veteran
population. For hearing loss too severe to be helped by hearing aids, cochlear implants have become the
standard of care. Though they can restore the ability to understand speech for many, current electrodes have
poor selectivity for neuronal excitation. This limits fidelity leading to difficulty with background noise, talking on
the phone, and music appreciation. Researchers at the Center for Neurotrauma, Neurodegeneration, and
Restoration (CNNR) at the CMC-VAMC have pioneered biologically-based neural interfaces with neuron-
specific stimulation that have yet to be applied to hearing restoration. This project utilizes transplantable living
scaffolds for the rehabilitation of hearing through biohybrid neural interfaces.
Biohybrid neural interfaces will be developed that allow transplanted spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) to remain
accessible to stimulation while their axons interact with neurons of the central auditory pathway or cochlea –
creating a “living electrode”. SGN will be harvested from neonatal rat temporal bones and the cells’ ability to
stimulate a distinct population of SGN (cochlear implantation), and centrally derived neurons (brainstem
implantation) will be confirmed in culture. Light activated opsins will also be induced to allow for optical
stimulation. SGNs will then be grown on two distinct scaffolds in vitro. The first directs transplanted SGN axons
to the inferior colliculus in the brainstem, and the second directs them from the round window of the cochlea to
the native spiral ganglion. Both designs allow for electric and optical stimulation of the transplanted SGN cell
bodies. Once transplanted into living rats, cell survival and integration are evaluated with
immunohistochemistry at various timepoints for up to 6 months. Electrophysiologic recordings from the auditory
cortex will be obtained in deafened rats implanted with either the brainstem or cochlear scaffolds, while being
stimulated either electrically or optically. Behavioral models will then used to evaluate the auditory perception
induced via stimulation of the living scaffolds.
The final product of this project will be two form-factors of living electrodes for hearing rehabilitation, one for
implantation into the inferior colliculus and one for implantation into the cochlea. It is expected that the neuron-
specific simulation permitted by this technique will allow for precision in stimulation of the auditory system that
cannot be approached by current implant technology.
This is a resubmission of a new proposal.
This work is directly translatable to improved implantable hearing devices for those with hearing loss too
severe to be adequately rehabilitated with traditional hearing aids. Improvement in the rehabilitative options for
these veterans will have a significant impact on their quality of life and well-being.
Not only does the proposed work advance a next generation, biologically based interface to restore the ability
to interpret sophisticated auditory inputs in our Veterans, as a Career Development Award, it will also serve as
vehicle to expand my technical skills in tissue engineering and regenerative therapies. This CDA will form the
foundation of a career in pushing the boundaries of hearing restoration."
10881648,"70 million Americans suffer from some sort of sleep disorder. Behavior, mood and memory deteriorate
with sleep loss and it gets worse with continuing sleep deprivation. Sleep disturbance is a frequent and
common complaint among our Veterans. Lack of sleep due to hyperarousal is one symptom of PTSD, but it is
not known why Veterans with PTSD cannot fall asleep. My research focuses on identifying and mapping the
brain neurons that induce sleep. The overall impact of my research is that it will provide the first direct
evidence linking specific phenotypes of neurons and their circuits responsible for inducing sleep. This will make
it possible to induce sleep in conditions where the arousal drive is very strong, such as in the insomnia of
PTSD, or to maintain wakefulness when there is excessive sleepiness, such as in patients with obstructive
sleep apnea or atypical depression.
 One series of experiments uses optogenetics and pharmacogenetics to identify functional circuits in the
brain. The brain contains many different types of cells and through optogenetics and pharmacogenetics it is
now possible to disassemble the brain to identify the culprit neurons responsible for complex behaviors, such
as sleep. My lab was the first in the area of sleep neurobiology to use optogenetics to induce sleep
(Konadhode et al., 2013, attached). We activated a specific phenotype of neurons in the hypothalamus and
discovered that it induced sleep at a time of day when the mouse should have been awake. We have now
shown the same effect in rats, indicating that activating these neurons drives sleep across mammals. We now
want to test the sleep-inducing effect in conditions of high arousal, such as fear-conditioning (PTSD) or anxiety.
 In conjunction with optogenetics and pharmacogenetics, I am using the deep-brain imaging method to
image the activity of phenotype-specific neurons in the brains. This method measures changes in
fluorescence of a genetically encoded calcium indicator in individual neurons. The fluorescence signal is
captured via a microendoscope attached to a miniature microscope (2g). The microendoscope can be placed
anywhere in the brains of mice providing unprecedented record of neuronal activity. I am using it to obtain
visual evidence of the activity of specific neuronal circuits during sleep and waking.
 Another series of studies uses the CLARITY method to map the circuit activated by optogenetics.
CLARITY is a new neuroanatomical method that makes postmortem tissue, such as the brain, transparent.
The PI collaborated with RHJVAMC researchers to acquire a Zeiss Lightsheet microscope and used it to
produce a 3D reconstruction of brain neuronal circuits (see Shiromani and Peever, 2017 attached). My intent is
to use CLARITY to visualize postmortem brains in rodent models of TBI, and also image a transparent heart,
liver and kidney. The goal is to provide a visual record of the break in a circuit in diseased tissue.
 The fourth series of experiments use the gene transfer approach to fix defective circuits and restore
behavior. I have used it to successfully to correct behavioral symptoms in a mouse model of the
neurodegenerative sleep disorder, narcolepsy. We are now using the gene transfer method to block triggering
of abnormal behavior, for example in fear-conditioning. Overall, these neuroscience methods and tools aid the
collective research effort at RHJ VAMC."
10881638,"Dr. Vemuganti’s current research is to find therapies for preventing secondary brain damage and to promote
neurological recovery following either traumatic brain injury (TBI) or ischemic stroke. TBI and stroke are leading
causes of disability in service personnel and Veterans and they suffer the effects of these for decades after the
initial events.
Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that starts within hours and continues for days promotes
neuronal death that lead to long-term neurological deficits after TBI. Hence, the currently funded Merit Review
Grant of Dr. Vemuganti will test the hypothesis that an antioxidant combination therapy (to prevent the formation
of ROS and induce the disposal of ROS) protects the brain and promotes long-term functional gains in both
sexes at different ages after TBI. We further test the hypothesis that preventing oxidative stress and ER stress
together is more efficacious to protect the brain and to promote neurological recovery after TBI. We will also test
the hypothesis that controlling oxidative stress decreases the propensity of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathology
after TBI. The studies will use a well-developed mouse model of TBI known as controlled cortical impact injury.
Motor function, cognitive function and neuropsychiatric function will be studied as well as cortical contusion in
mice subjected to TBI and treated with the combo therapies. Overall, the present project will help us to find a
drug combo that minimizes secondary brain damage and neurologic dysfunction after TBI by curtailing oxidative
stress and ER stress after TBI. The long-term goal is to provide a therapy to help service personnel and Veterans
who suffer a TBI.
Stroke promotes significant motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. However, there is no efficacious
therapy to prevent post-stroke brain damage and neurologic deficits. Recent studies showed that modulating
specific microRNAs (miRNAs) leads to neuroprotection and better functional recovery after stroke in rodents.
The miRNA miR-21 is anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory. We observed that miR-21 levels in the brain
increases by treatment with a miR-21 mimic without any toxicity. Hence, in a Merit Review Grant that is currently
pending, Dr. Vemuganti will test the hypothesis that miR-21 mimic is a potent neuroprotective therapy to prevent
post-stroke brain damage using a mouse stroke model called transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) stipulated many criteria for testing new therapies.
Following those, we will test the window of therapeutic efficacy, long-term motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric
outcomes, effect of sex, age and diabetes (comorbid condition for stroke) on miR-21 mimic-induced
neuroprotection following transient MCAO. Recent studies showed that gut microbiome influences inflammation
in the post-stroke brain. Hence, we will further test the hypothesis that miR-21 mediated post-stroke
neuroprotection is due to prevention of gut microbiome dysbiosis leading to curtailed inflammation. The overall
goal is to establish miR-21 as a neuroprotective miRNA with potential to decrease post-stroke brain damage and
improve functional recovery by rectifying gut dysbiosis and inflammation. If successful, these studies leads to
establishment of miR-21 as a new therapy to help service personnel and Veterans who suffer a stroke."
10848305,"Abstract
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy. Emerging data indicate that a substantial percentage of SUDEP is due to seizure-induced respiratory
arrest. There is a gap in knowledge about how seizures cause apnea, who is at highest risk and what can be
done to prevent it. We have found that postictal death is due to seizure-induced apnea in two genetic mouse
models of human SUDEP (Scn1aR1407X and Scn8aN1768D mice). Our data indicate that seizures activate
projections from the amygdala to the brainstem causing central apnea, and transient defects in CO2
homeostasis and serotonin (5-HT) neuron function. This is supported by data showing that 5-HT neurons,
which are central CO2/pH chemoreceptors that stimulate breathing, are inhibited during seizures. The central
hypothesis of the current proposal is that seizures impair CO2 chemoreception, in part by inhibiting 5-HT
neurons, which increases the risk of a seizure becoming fatal. We have also found that a diet supplemented
with milk whey causes a large reduction in the risk of SUDEP, and this may be due to an increase in 5-HT.
This proposal will use Scn1aR1407X and Scn8aN1768D mice to carry out the following specific aims. 1) Determine
the role of impaired CO2 chemoreception in fatal post-ictal apnea. Working hypothesis: Seizures inhibit CO2
chemoreception, which increases the risk of fatal apnea. Our preliminary data indicate that generalized
seizures cause a large post-ictal decrease in ventilation, a decrease in the hypercapnic ventilatory response
(HCVR), and a transient drop in body temperature. All three of these homeostatic brainstem functions are
controlled by serotonin neurons. We will use 24-hour monitoring of EEG, EMG, EKG, plethysmography, body
temperature and video in a mouse epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) to study changes due to spontaneous
seizures. 2) We will define the contribution of 5-HT system dysfunction to postictal hypoventilation and apnea.
Working hypothesis: Impairment of the 5-HT system worsens ictal and post-ictal hypoventilation. A decrease in
brain 5-HT has been shown to decrease the HCVR. We will increase or decrease brain 5-HT in mice and
measure the frequency of spontaneous sudden death, and postictal changes in the HCVR. 3) Define the
mechanisms by which whey prevents SUDEP. Working hypothesis: SUDEP risk is reduced by whey via an
increase in brain 5-HT and/or CO2 chemoreception. We propose to examine whether whey is effective in
preventing seizure-induced death in Scn8aN1768D, Kcna1-null and DBA/1 mice. We will examine whether whey
prevents inhibition of the HCVR with seizures. We will examine which components have a protective effect on
survival, and whether they act through changes in 5-HT. The expected outcome is that CO2 chemoreception
will be established as central to the mechanisms of SUDEP and to how whey protects against it. The broader
impact is that whey may be a new and safe approach to prevent SUDEP that targets mechanisms underlying
postictal respiratory arrest."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an asymptomatic, multifactorial, chronic liver fibrotic disease that
drastically impairs hepatic function and affects a large proportion of the US population. NASH is caused by a
diet-related fattening of the liver that progresses with inflammation, hepatocyte degeneration, and a pro-fibrotic
response that ultimately results in cirrhosis and liver failure. There are no FDA-approved treatments for NASH
and the only options for disease management are changes in lifestyle, bariatric surgery, or liver transplantation.
The need for therapeutic measures to combat NASH is thus enormous, especially considering that the number
of patients diagnosed worldwide is increasing dramatically due to the growing epidemic of obesity and
diabetes. This proposal identifies the EphB receptor tyrosine kinases and their transmembrane EphrinB ligands
as molecules to target for the treatment of NASH. Cell-cell interactions of EphB receptors with EphrinB ligands
initiates bidirectional signaling cascades that can affect diverse biological processes relevant to NASH
fibrogenesis including cellular remodelling, angiogenesis, migration/proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-
transition, and inflammation. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a potent inhibitor of EphB/EphrinB
signaling for the treatment of NASH. We will leverage our early work that shows EphB2 promotes hepatic
inflammation and fibrosis in mice with our recent discovery of a potent small molecule EphB/EphrinB receptor-
ligand chemical antagonist/inhibitor. The objective of this application is to optimize our prototype lead
compound to maximize its inhibitory and pharmacological properties for the treatment of NASH. Using in vitro
assays, our preliminary data indicates the prototype lead compound reduces TGF-β1-driven trans-
differentiation of primary human hepatic stellate cells into pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts, a process known to
contribute to liver fibrosis in NASH. Furthermore, early tests of our lead compound in vivo indicates it reduces
steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in clinically relevant NASH mouse models. Guided by strong early-stage
preclinical data on the efficacy of our prototype lead compound to resolve liver fibrosis and metabolic
dysfunction associated with NASH, Aim 1 will focus on medicinal chemistry efforts to better understand the
structure activity relationship of our lead compound and to identify and characterize more potent related analog
chemicals that exhibit improved antagonist activity and drug-like pharmacological properties. In Aim 2 we will
test and validate the efficacy of our lead compound and the resulting new and improved analogs for their ability
to reverse liver fibrosis and metabolic dysfunction in established NASH models. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting EphB/EphrinB signalling for the
treatment of NASH. The proposed research is highly significant because it will advance for the treatment of
NASH novel compounds that target a signaling axis not currently in the interest or forefront of the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries."

CRISPR-Cas loci provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids. By
remembering and destroying foreign genetic elements, CRISPR-Cas systems also restrict
horizontal gene transfer, a frequent route for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes
and toxins. To balance defense with genetic exchange, CRISPR-Cas systems likely undergo
spatiotemporal regulation; however, little is known about the ways in which CRISPR-Cas loci
interact with their bacterial hosts or changing environments.
My laboratory studies type II CRISPR-Cas systems, which encode the gene-editing tool cas9.
CRISPR-Cas9 systems are frequently found in human pathogens like S. pyogenes, and we are
focused on understanding how CRISPR-Cas9 activities are intertwined with and often defined
by the biology of their bacterial host cell. We recently discovered that S. pyogenes Cas9
performs a novel autoregulatory function. A non-canonical guide RNA repurposes Cas9 from a
nuclease into a transcriptional repressor that silences its own promoter. This finding helps
explain how CRISPR-Cas9 systems prevent autoimmunity against the bacterial chromosome,
but it remains unclear how CRISPR-Cas expression can be induced as needed, for instance
during or preceding a phage infection.
In this proposal, we explore two new directions in CRISPR-Cas biology. First, we investigate the
non-canonical regulatory roles of Cas9. Specifically, we characterize the conditions and
mechanisms that allow Cas9 to transiently relieve its repression and induce CRISPR-Cas
expression, and we ask whether Cas9 evolved to regulate other bacterial genes outside the
CRISPR-Cas locus. These studies will establish a new foundation for understanding the role of
Cas9 in the physiology of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, our studies on
non-canonical guide RNAs will lead to new strategies for the development of controllable Cas9
technologies and therapies. In our second project, we establish an innovative imaging platform
to observe live CRISPR-Cas immunization events for the first time. This project will illuminate a
fundamental unanswered question in CRISPR-Cas biology: why are new memories successfully
formed in only one in a million infected cells? The answers will provide new clues into the ways
in which heterogeneity within bacterial populations enables survival. Furthermore, these insights
and tools will be valuable for the development of phage therapies, which are offering promise in
combatting the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens."

All eukaryotes harbor host-associated microbiomes. Determining what regulates host-microbiome function has
the potential to revolutionize our approaches towards maintenance of host health. Host genetics and the
environment are two key factors that contribute towards host-microbiome composition and function. We aim to
advance our understanding of the relative roles of these two factors in regulating assembly of microbial
communities, short-term changes in these communities through ecological succession, and long-term changes
through evolutionary processes. Further, microbiomes are complex biological networks. Understanding the
underlying structure of ecological interactions within these networks can improve predictions for when and how
microbiomes might confer beneficial versus deleterious functions associated with disease. Our lab aims to
advance fundamental understanding of host-microbiomes by leveraging the microbiomes of microbes.
Specifically we employ single-celled eukaryotic phytoplankton as a highly-tractable experimental system. To
further these goals we will focus on the following three themes over the next five years. (1) We will couple the
unparalleled diversity of phytoplankton with bacterial –omics approaches to test how microbiomes assemble in
response to host genetics. By assessing bacterial gene expression responses to host genetics, in tandem with
fluctuating environmental conditions, this work will lend insights in to the host genetic x environmental forces
that drive microbiome assembly of eukaryotic microbiomes. (2) We will evaluate mechanisms of microbiome
change for maintenance of host homeostasis in fluctuating environments, including ecological shifts in bacterial
taxonomic composition, shifts in bacterial gene expression, and bacterial strain evolution. It is important to
understand the relative roles of these mechanisms because each occurs over different timescales and their
effects can have varying degrees of permanence on their host. (3) We will leverage classical community
ecology theory in biological networks with recent advances in flow cytometry bacterial fingerprinting to
characterize traits of transient versus stable microbiome networks. We will quantify bacteria-bacteria
interaction strengths within naturally assembled and engineered microbiomes to understand how network
structure contributes to transitions between host health and disease states. Additionally, our research program
will elucidate the implications of declining microbial diversity on eukaryotic host health. We will study host-
microbiome co-evolutionary mismatches, such as those caused by humans consuming processed diets and
living in human-built environments that differ from those of our evolutionary history. Ultimately, our work will
leverage a highly tractable experimental system to advance our understanding of the microbiomes that
modulate human health."

Heart transplantation (Tx) remains the therapy of choice for patients with end-stage heart failure. However, long-
term graft and patient survival remains suboptimal due to chronic rejection and high rates of morbidity and
mortality associated with life-long immunosuppression (IS). IS-resistant memory T cells (Tmem) play a major
role in chronic rejection and are considered a major barrier to graft survival. To date, no immunotherapy has
been clinically proven to be effective in the prevention or treatment of Tmem-mediated rejection.
Post-Tx inflammatory milieux promote cytokine-mediated pathogenic donor-reactive Tmem (darTmem) function
and are equally detrimental to donor-reactive regulatory T cells (darTreg). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
promote interleukin (IL)-6 mediated graft injury and dysfunction. Concomitantly, IL-6 prevents T cell regulation,
promotes IS-resistant T cells, and abrogates long-term graft acceptance. Our preliminary data suggest that ROS
and IL-6 promote graft endothelial cell dysfunction in recipient monkeys. It is known that IL-7 and IL-15 jointly
orchestrate Tmem generation and persistence. IL-7 prevents T cell regulation, while IL-15 augments clonal
expansion of IS-resistant darTmem. Our preliminary studies demonstrate increased IL-7 and IL-15 mediated
pathogenic darTmem percentages and function at the time of rejection in recipient monkeys. Adoptive Treg
therapy remains at the forefront of innovative cell-based therapy in Tx. Treg engineered with chimeric antigen
receptors (CARTreg) that recognize specific donor MHC molecules home and reside in target tissues of
humanized mouse models, with superior suppressive function compared to conventional Treg.
In this application, we propose to test the unifying hypothesis that early post-Tx cytokine modulation and donor-
specific T cell regulation will induce durable high darTreg-to-darTmem ratios, promote long-term graft
protection, and maintain protective immunity. We propose to test this hypothesis, through combined (i) cytokine
modulation using newly developed rhesus-specific (rh) mAbs and (ii) administration of novel monkey Bw6-
specific CARTreg, in heart allograft recipient monkeys. We have 3 specific aims:
Aim 1: To investigate the impact of IL-6 neutralization on early post-Tx ROS-mediated graft injury and darTmem
development, using rh anti-IL-6 neutralizing mAb. Aim 2: To Attenuate the persistence of IS-resistant darTmem
through dual targeting of IL-7 and IL15 receptors in allograft recipients, using rh blocking mAbs. Aim 3: To induce
durable T cell regulation through combined administration of Bw6-specific CARTreg and cytokine modulation
conducive of prolonged graft acceptance.
The proposed research will define inciting molecular and cellular mechanisms that promote IS-resistant rejection
and provide the foundation for the development of novel and clinically relevant therapeutic strategies amenable
to rapid clinical translation."

Surgical patients expect to return to their pre-morbid state after the procedure for their underlying condition;
unfortunately, perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNDs) may complicate their recovery resulting in a
spectrum of conditions ranging from early-onset delirium to dementia in the longer term. The surgical populations
that are most at risk for developing PNDs are the aged and those with existing cognitive decline, which most
often is due to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The proportion of surgical patients with these risks is rising steadily.
While neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the development of PNDs, it remains unknown which
inflammatory cytokines are acting on which cell types to produce the clinical syndrome. Recently, interleukin 6
(IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, has come to the fore as a leading candidate for provoking PNDs. Our central
hypothesis to be tested, using animal models of aging and AD, is that vulnerability to PNDs is due to an increase
in hippocampal (hc) neuronal IL-6 trans-signaling, which can be assessed perioperatively and can be attenuated
with sgp130Fc, a selective blocker. We will test this hypothesis by addressing 5 questions in three Specific Aims
(SA). (1) Is the vulnerability to PNDs in aged and AD mouse models associated with upregulation of IL-6 trans-
signaling/neurodegeneration in a part of the brain that contains circuitry involved in memory (SA 1a)? (2) What
are the antecedents and/or surrogates of postoperative upregulated IL-6 trans-signaling (SA 1b)? (3) What are
the genetic consequences of postoperative IL-6 trans-signaling in hc cells (SA 1c)? (4) Can vulnerability to PNDs
be overcome prophylactically, and therapeutically, with blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling (SA 2)? (5) Is blockade
of IL-6 trans-signaling safe for perioperative use (SA 3)? These questions will be answered using validated
preclinical mouse models in which aged, AD transgenic, and IL-6 overexpressing mice, with control littermates,
will be subjected to orthopedic surgery, resulting in disrupted spatial memory, and inattentiveness (i.e., ‘cognitive
impairment’), that will be assessed with behavioral assays. Levels of the components of IL-6 trans-signaling,
blood brain barrier disruption, neurodegeneration, and hc neuronal phosphorylated signal transducer and
activator of transcription (pSTAT3), will be longitudinally assessed perioperatively. The genetic consequences
of pSTAT3 upregulation will be assessed by single cell RNA sequencing to establish whether cognate proteins
of genes affected by IL-6 trans-signaling can be a therapeutic target. Using sgp130Fc, a selective blocker of IL-
6 trans-signaling, either prophylactically or therapeutically, the effects of blockade on cognitive impairment and
IL-6 trans-signaling, as well as its genetic consequences, together with its safety profile, will be investigated.
Results from these aims will inform on critically needed therapies for safe prevention and/or reversal of
postoperative cognitive impairments in older adults and subjects with neurodegenerative disorders and possibly
for treating delirium and cognitive impairment associated with neuroinflammation in non-surgical settings."
10839851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CaV1.2 channels and their modulation are fundamentally important for the normal function and
pathophysiology of the heart. Disruption of CaV1.2 function and regulation results in electrical and
Ca2+ disturbances that underlie life-threatening cardiac diseases including arrhythmias,
cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. CaV1.2 serves as the primary portal for Ca2+ influx into
cardiomyocytes that initiates excitation-contraction coupling, sculpts the action potential
morphology, underlies inotropy, and supports activity-dependent gene transcription. To fulfill
diverse cellular functions, CaV1.2 channels recruit a rich repertoire of regulatory proteins, yielding
heterogeneous macromolecular complexes. In this regard, the CaV1.2 auxiliary subunits (α2δ and
β2) and various regulatory proteins have emerged as key players in orchestrating trafficking,
gating, and adrenergic regulation. Recent work using proximity proteomics suggests that the
CaV1.2 neighborhood extends beyond these well-studied subunits. Yet, how the non-canonical
interacting proteins tune CaV1.2 function, and how alterations in channel regulation contribute to
pathophysiology are largely unknown. This gap impairs forward progress in our understanding of
CaV1.2 in cardiac physiology and thwarts the development of new therapies. Thus, the overall
objective of this project within the PPG is to construct a next-generation blueprint of functionally-
relevant cardiac CaV1.2 modulators, and to determine the contribution of channel mis-regulation
by non-canonical regulators in heart failure. We develop a novel functional screening approach
to systematically identify potential CaV1.2 modulators. We further undertake extensive
mechanistic analysis of two non-canonical CaV1.2 modulators―Leucine rich repeat containing
protein 10 (Lrrc10) and Junctophilin-2 (Jph2), both linked to cardiomyopathies and heart failure.
In addition, we leverage the Pakistan Genome Resource which provides genome sequencing
data and deep cardio-metabolic phenotyping of individuals with loss-of-function mutations in both
Lrrc10 and Jph2 to discern the function importance of the proteins to human physiology. The three
specific aims are: (1) Identify functionally-relevant non-canonical modulators of CaV1.2. (2)
Elucidate the mechanism of Lrrc10 modulation of CaV1.2 and effects of DCM-linked mutations.
(3) Identify mechanism of Jph2 modulation of CaV1.2 and effects of human mutations."

The overarching goal of this PPG is to define the molecular mechanisms that regulate local calcium (Ca2+)
signaling in normal and failing hearts with unprecedented precision. There are three goals shared by the four
projects: 1) explore the precise role of adrenergic signaling in modulating calcium in normal and failing hearts;
2) define novel mechanisms of interactions between T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium channels;
3) develop new understandings of genetic based mechanisms of inherited forms of CV disease involving calcium.
Project four provides the essential link to SR calcium release by studying the structure-function relationships of
the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2)/calcium release channel present on the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic
reticula (SR/ER) of many cell types in the context of heart failure (chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction,
HFrEF). RyR2 channels are required for Ca2+ release from intracellular stores that triggers excitation-contraction
(EC) coupling in the cardiac muscle. Inherited RyR2 mutations can cause arrhythmias including exercise-induced
sudden death or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and stress-induced post-
translational modifications of RyR2 contribute to heart failure (HF) progression. In both cases RyR2 channels
are leaky either due to inherited mutations (CPVT) or acquired post-translational modifications (HF). Unanswered
questions include: 1) can (and if so how) RyR2 mutations can cause HF; 2) what is the precise mechanism by
which PKA phosphorylation activates RyR2 and plays a role in HF? Preliminary data using cryo-EM to solve the
structure of human RyR2 at ~2.4 Å show that a human CPVT mutation RyR2-R2474S puts the channel into a
“primed state” from which it can be readily and pathologically activated at low, normally non-activating [Ca2+]cyt
explaining why these channels are leaky and cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias during exercise or stress. The
Rycal drug ARM210 binds to RyR2 and restores the mutant channel back to a stable closed state preventing
leak and arrhythmias. The applicant hypothesizes that RyR2 missense mutations, 14 of which are found in
patients with a ClinVar prediction of cardiomyopathy in patients from the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR), a
unique cohort of individuals with extensive phenotype data and high rates of consanguinity, (Core A), may be
gain of function (GoF) mutations that also put the channel into a primed state which is even more sensitive to
activation compared to the CPVT mutations. Thus, these patients have leaky RyR2 channels and develop HF
due to depletion of SR Ca2+ resulting in impaired cardiac contractility. These questions will be addressed using
functional and structural assays and using a novel drug, Rycal (ARM210), that fixes the RyR2 mediated SR
Ca2+ leak via a well-defined mechanism. Three aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate changes in the function and
structure of RyR2 GoF missense variants linked to heart failure (HFrEF); 2) Evaluate the effect of Rycal on the
structure/function of human RyR2 and disease related variants; and 3) Examine the molecular mechanism by
which adrenergic signaling regulates RyR2 function in normal and failing hearts."
10841515,"Obesity (body mass index, BMI >30) afflicts millions of people in the United States and
other countries, and is a major risk factor for heart disease, type II diabetes mellitus,
stroke, hypertension, and morbidity. The G-protein coupled melanocortin-3 receptor
(MC3R) is expressed in the central nervous system (brain) and is part of the
melanocortin pathway involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. The specific role
of the MC3R in the regulation of obesity has not been clearly defined due to a lack of
receptor specific ligands and a complex metabolic phenotype of the MC3R knockout
mouse. This project is focused upon the discovery of MC3R selective molecular probes
(peptide and small molecules), in vitro lead candidate selection, and use of wild type and
knockout mice for further molecule lead selection. The working hypothesis of this project
is that the MC3R is directly involved in the regulation of food intake, satiety, and
energy/metabolic homeostasis. It is anticipated that MC3R ligands have the potential to
become therapeutic ligands for obesity related diseases that bypass the human
melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist associated side effects of male erectile activity
and hypertension."
10837696,"ABSTRACT
Nuclear structure-chromatin interactions underlie spatial genome organization and gene regulation during
development and disease. However, the mechanisms by which distinct nuclear structures control these
processes remain poorly defined. Understanding these mechanisms is critical, especially given that the
changes in the nuclear structure can propagate to alterations in cell signaling, cell division and genome
stability. The nuclear structure is in part composed of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and lamina. Proteins
that are the building blocks of the NPCs, called Nucleoporins (Nups), have been implicated in transcription
and chromatin regulation by directly binding to chromatin. The NPC provides a nuclear compartment that
accommodates subnuclear organization of genes, transcription factors and chromatin regulatory proteins.
However, we still have very limited understanding on the molecular determinants and mechanisms of Nup-
mediated transcription and chromatin structure in mammalian cells, and how these processes are governed
during early development. Work to date suggests functional roles for Nups in cell type-specific gene
regulation. Findings of this proposal will fill remaining gaps in knowledge regarding the exact mechanisms of
how the NPCs influence binding of chromatin regulatory proteins at different genes, and how this mechanism
influences transcription, peripheral chromatin organization and spatial positioning of genes. We recently
provided new evidence that a particular Nup, NUP153, influences transcription and chromatin structure of
developmentally regulated genes by mediating POL II pausing and binding of chromatin architectural
proteins, CTCF and cohesin, at cis-regulatory elements. Towards dissecting the molecular basis of NUP153-
mediated CTCF binding, we identified the catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex,
BRG1, as an NUP153 interacting protein. We hypothesize that the NPC-chromatin interactions through
NUP153 mediate transcription, chromatin structure and peripheral chromatin organization by controlling
BRG1 and CTCF binding. We propose that this mechanism in coordination with POL II pausing is necessary
for cell type-specific gene regulation during early development. We will test this hypothesis by utilizing human
HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and performing genome-wide and genic assays. In Aim
1, we will determine the functional significance of NUP153-BRG1 interactions in NPC-mediated chromatin
structure and transcription. In Aim 2, we will define regulatory function of NPC in spatial chromatin
organization across the lamina. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the functional relevance of NPC-chromatin
interactions in early development. Collectively, findings of this study will provide critical insights into the
functional role for the NPC in integrating transcriptional regulation with chromatin remodeling, and spatial
organization of chromatin, and how POL II pausing and activity participate in these processes during cell
type-specific gene regulation in early development."
10851718,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio A Disease) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a
deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS). GALNS catalyzes
the degradation of the glycosaminoglycans: keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). MPS IVA
patients develop a characteristic skeletal dysplasia due to the progressive storage of KS and C6S. Patients
appear healthy at birth, although some patients present with abnormal skeletal dysplasia even at birth. Patients
usually come to medical attention within two years of life because of short trunk dwarfism, odontoid hypoplasia,
pectus carinatum, kyphosis, genu valgum, or hypermobile joints. Patients with severe phenotype often do not
survive beyond a few decades of life because of cervical instability/stenosis, tracheal obstruction, and
cardiopulmonary compromise. Patients require multiple orthopedic surgeries (cervical decompression/fusion,
osteotomy, hip reconstruction and replacement, etc.) throughout their lifetime. Enzyme replacement therapy
and hematopoietic stem cell therapy are available clinically. Gene therapy and enzyme degradation substrate
therapy are under development. In 1998, we began collecting medical information from patients in the Registry
Database. The database contains around 400 patients and has established a growth chart that indicates
marked poor growth with the imbalance and consequent poor health in MPS IVA. However, since these data
are based on responses to a self-completion questionnaire, there are inherent limitations to the data and their
interpretation. Current clinical assessments of therapies for MPS IVA patients are a 6-min walk test, a 3-min
stair climb test, and forced pulmonary function test. These endurance tests are difficult for small children,
patients in wheelchairs, and patients undergoing surgical procedures. Methods used to assess skeletal
dysplasia disorders can be expensive, time-consuming, and exhausting for the patients. Better methods for
assessment, including in-home evaluations, are needed to evaluate clinical efficacy and to provide optimal
clinical treatments for MPS IVA patients. The proposed project will assess multiple domains non-invasively,
which includes pulmonary function, bone mineralization, gait pattern, laxity of joints, tracheal function, and
hearing function. Proposed non-invasive assessments will provide an effective and innovative way of
characterizing the disease and evaluating the benefits of therapies even in small but diverse patient
populations despite age and physical handicaps. Over 100 MPS IVA patients have been enrolled in our clinic,
making our institution the most popular site in the world and ideally suited to complete this project. The
assessment program with non-invasive methods will have a significant impact on science and health by
detailing the progression and pathogenesis of major skeletal problems in MPS IVA. The outcome of this project
will also define clinical endpoints to measure the efficacy of future clinical products and interventions and may
apply to other skeletal dysplasias.

10846595,"Amputation is a devastating but preventable complication of diabetes (DM) and peripheral arterial disease
(PAD); it serves as a marker for severe cardiovascular disease and for disparities in quality of care.
Although rural populations have multiple risk factors for amputation, there is a critical gap in amputation
research in rural communities, with very little data available on amputation prevention interventions
designed to meet the needs of these communities to improve health outcomes. West Virginia (WV), a
highly rural state with some of the highest national prevalence rates of DM and cardiovascular disease,
is a location in great need of innovative solutions to prevent these complications. My long-term career
goal is to become a clinician-investigator in health disparities research focused on designing and
implementing community-engaged interventions that will reduce amputation rates in patients with DM
and PAD. My preliminary work in this area demonstrated that DM and PAD-related amputation rates in
WV are up to 6 times higher than the national average. Moreover, despite adjusting for multiple risk
factors, the risk of amputation is clustered in certain high-risk geographic regions in WV. This Mentored
Career Development Training Award (K23) is the ideal opportunity for me to obtain the skills, training and
mentorship needed to achieve this goal. The objective of this study is to develop, implement and assess
an amputation prevention intervention designed for use in high-risk rural areas using community
engagement approaches. I will test the central hypothesis that an amputation prevention intervention
developed and implemented in a community-engaged fashion will be feasible and acceptable for use in
high-risk rural areas. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) develop a provider-based amputation
prevention intervention appropriate for high-risk rural areas using community engagement approaches,
2) implement and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the collaboratively-developed, provider-based
amputation prevention intervention using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) and refine the intervention based on these findings, and 3) translate and disseminate findings to
community Stakeholders, and then widely to other high-risk rural areas to prepare for implementation of
a multi-area intervention effectiveness study. Guided by a strong multidisciplinary mentorship team and
an active Community Engagement and Outreach Core with an established Provider-Based Research
Network through the WV Clinical and Translational Science Institute, I am poised to successful conduct
this research plan in rural WV. The training and research plan for this K23 award will enable me to
achieve my long-term career goal, to become a leader in vascular surgery with both expertise in limb
preservation and designing and implementing community-engaged interventions to address vascular
disease-related health disparities."

This is an application for a 5-year renewal of an institutional training grant in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics
of Aging, funded by NIA since 1996. This interdisciplinary program's goals are to train outstanding predoctoral
and postdoctoral candidates to lead the next generation of quantitative research scientists addressing the
health of our aging population. This program is conducted jointly by epidemiologists and biostatisticians with a
strong commitment to bringing together students in both disciplines to develop expertise in the content areas
and methodologies that are essential to advancement of the field. Students are trained to conduct leading-
edge research that can inform the development of prevention programs to compress morbidity in the aging
population. The program is based in the Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Mental Health. It
further involves faculty from departments throughout our Schools of Public Health, Medicine, and Nursing. A
Program Director in Biostatistics, Co-Directors from Epidemiology and Mental Health, 6 other Associate
Directors, and 19 other core faculty members will serve as mentors for the trainees. We propose to maintain
our current program size of 8 predoctoral / 2 postdoctoral positions, in numbers balanced across sponsoring
departments. We will support postdoctoral fellows at experience level 0, and those with clinical backgrounds
seeking advanced research degree training, at level 5. We will target a 3-4 year duration for each predoctoral
trainee and a two-year duration for each postdoctoral trainee. A core curriculum is expected of predoctoral
trainees and customized to postdoctoral trainees. Trainees will continue to participate in biweekly research in
progress meetings, seminars on aging, practica specific to this program, and training to build skills
interdisciplinary collaboration. Research experiences and mentors are selected to ensure high quality findings
worthy of peer-reviewed publication. We will continue to train students in epidemiologic and biostatistical
methods and their application to aging, with topical emphases of data-intensive measurement and analysis in
aging; the epidemiology of frailty, resilience, disability and chronic disease; statistical design, modeling and
inference for gerontology; and cognitive, sensory and psychosocial aging. Longstanding content and new
content (resilience; massive cohorts and health records) is to be combined within these emphases. Trainees
have been highly productive, gained substantial recognition for their research, and launched their careers in
appealing positions with aging focus. Graduates will be effective leaders of multidisciplinary research teams
tackling the health problems associated with the aging US population."
10852891,"Project Abstract
Household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel combustion is a major contributor to poor ambient air pollution and
health. Global efforts to address HAP in low- and middle-income countries have focused on provision of clean
cookstoves. Household waste burning, especially of plastics, is a major, but unaddressed environmental and
health hazard in countries that lack infrastructure to properly dispose of waste. In rural Guatemala, 95% of
households use solid fuels for cooking and 71% burn waste as the primary means of disposal. Burning plastic
releases bisphenols and phthalates, which may disrupt neurodevelopment, endocrine, and reproductive function.
No studies have examined biomarkers of exposure to chemicals in women of reproductive age who are
disproportionately exposed to airborne burning plastic, likely at higher levels than in high-income countries. There
are no emissions estimates of air pollutants from plastic waste incineration in Central America. This proposal will
implement community working groups that will improve air quality by reducing household plastic waste burning,
reduce exposure, and improve health-related quality of life in women of reproductive age. Using a randomized
cluster trial design, we will randomize 20 rural villages (10 intervention; 10 control) in Jalapa, Guatemala and
randomly select 400 women of reproductive age (20 in each village) who report burning plastic trash as a primary
form of waste disposal to participate in urine biomonitoring and personal air monitoring. In 10 intervention
villages, we will invite community members to participate in 12-week working groups to implement alternatives
to burning plastic and determine achievable interventions over the subsequent 9 months. We will use the
Behavior Change Wheel and RE-AIM, two implementation science frameworks, and a mixed-methods approach,
to refine, implement, and evaluate community-initiated interventions that address plastic waste. We will assess
opportunities, capabilities and motivations that determine behaviors, as well as the reach, effectiveness,
adoption, implementation fidelity, maintenance and sustainability of interventions. At baseline, 4 and 12 months,
we will measure personal exposures to fine particulate matter and black carbon, and urinary biomarkers of
exposure (e.g., bisphenols, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds) in
400 women of reproductive age (15-44 years). We will use filter-based antimony and 1,3,5-Triphenylbenzene,
known tracers of plastic incineration, to quantify emissions estimates of air pollutants due to plastic burning.
Based on plastic waste reductions in intervention villages, we will assess regional impacts of pollutant emissions
reduction, using a 3D chemical transport model. This is the first study to use an implementation science approach
to implement and evaluate fidelity to intervention strategies to reduce plastic waste burning. Our findings will be
incorporated into community-driven public health actions with policymakers to develop programs in other local
contexts. This project has direct benefit not only to those residing in Guatemala, but also in other areas where
open waste burning contributes to air pollutants both regionally and globally."

The mechanical balance between the elastic properties and tension in the cornea plays a critical role in
normal vision, refractive corrective surgery, glaucoma screening, and the management of keratoconus.
Several experimental and commercial instruments are available, and they have provided clinical data that
suggest the potential values of biomechanical analysis. However, these devices offer limited quantitative
resolution and cannot characterize corneal elastic properties that are highly anisotropic, nonlinear, and
nonuniform. The overarching goal of this project is to advance optical coherence elastography (OCE) and
use this technology to measure the mechanical parameters in human corneas with unprecedented details.
Built on strong preliminary data, the new OCE harnesses extensional and flexural elastic waves guided
along the cornea and determines tensile modulus and shear modulus, as well as tension, from the profiles
and velocities of the waves. The first specific aim will develop wideband OCE using porcine and human
cadaver eyes ex vivo. Algorithms to quantify elastic moduli and tension with high precision and resolution
will be verified. The second specific aim will apply wideband OCE to obtain detailed mechanical data from
human corneas in vivo. The study will involve healthy subjects across the lifespan, ocular hypertension
patients, keratoconus patients, and subjects undergoing refractive surgeries. The potential impact of this
project is immense, as the expected data will improve our understanding of corneal biomechanics in
relation to the various natural, pathological, and interventional processes, and the technological advance
may lead to a new clinical tool that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus, the accuracy
of tonometry, and the safety and visual outcome of refractive surgery."
10878753,"This study will target a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying upper
limb poststroke spasticity, by directly assessing the descending motor and ascending sensory pathways in
hand function. Spasticity is one of the major motor impairments after stroke that typically begins to emerge
several weeks poststroke, impedes upper limb functional recovery, and gives rise to complications such as
weakness, contractures, and pain. It is traditionally characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle
tone (hypertonia) and increased spinal stretch reflex (hyperreflexia). Although the peripheral and spinal
signatures of spasticity have been extensively studied, its underlying brain mechanisms and brain-spinal
pathways are still controversial. This understanding is critically needed for resolving the current limitations in
clinical management of spasticity related to its early diagnosis, identification of prognostic factors, and lack of
effective treatments targeting the origin of the impairments rather than its symptoms. Preclinical studies have
shown that lesions of descending motor pathways including the reticulospinal tract (RST) may lead to spastic
hypertonia after stroke. In contrast, changes in the spinal sensory-motor circuits and the ascending sensory
projections may underlie hyperreflexia after stroke. Yet it is unclear how brain lesions after stroke lead to these
remote changes in the spinal cord circuit. Several theoretical models backed by early electrophysiological work
in cats propose that an imbalance of inhibitory and excitatory projections from the dorsal and medial RST plays
a critical role in spasticity. However, emerging evidence in primates suggests that the type of RST projections
(inhibitory/excitatory) does not follow a dorsal/medial organization, as presumed in current models of spasticity,
but depends on the laterality of projections. In this proposal, we aim to translate these new findings to humans,
and examine their relevance in poststroke spasticity. Our central hypothesis is that in stroke survivors with
spasticity, the imbalanced activation of ipsilateral vs contralateral RST is directly related to spastic hypertonia,
while the hyperactivity of dorsal column somatosensory projections is related to spastic hyperreflexia. To test
this hypothesis, we will employ a powerful neuroimaging method using simultaneous spinal cord–brain
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in chronic hemiplegic stroke patients with and without upper
limb spasticity, as well as healthy controls. Using this method, we will assess the function of major descending
(corticospinal, RST) and ascending (dorsal column, anterolateral tract) pathways during hand motor and
sensory functional tasks. We will determine how these neuroimaging markers relate to spastic hypertonia and
hyperreflexia, as evaluated by reliable biomechanical and electrophysiological measurements. Overall, the
proposed projects will advance our understanding of the neurobiological basis of poststroke spasticity, offer
new quantitative neuroimaging markers for accurate prognosis of spastic complications, and provide outcome
measures for evaluating what treatments most directly target the neural origins of spasticity."
10928696,"The objective of the proposed Summer Program for Academic Research in Cancer (SPARC) at the Indiana
University Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center (IUSCCC) is to provide cancer research career pathways for
undergraduate and medical students. This objective will be achieved by providing mentored, high-quality, cancer-
focused research experiences along with didactic and professional development workshops to undergraduate
and first year medical students to prepare them for cancer-related fields. Twenty-five trainees (15 undergraduate
and 10 first-year medical students) will be recruited every year to spend 10 weeks performing cancer research
and attend didactic and professional development workshops, clinical shadowing with physician-scientist
mentors in case of medical student trainees, and networking events. SPARC is open to any eligible student
across the country with a residential option for some, but we anticipate the majority of undergraduate students
to come from major universities in Indiana including Indiana University, University of Indianapolis, Indiana State
University, Purdue University, and the University of Notre Dame, whereas medical students are likely to be from
IU School of Medicine, the only allopathic medical school in Indiana, and potentially from Marian University
College of Osteopathic Medicine. While undergraduate trainees will potentially become graduate students in the
new translational cancer biology PhD program, medical trainees can become part of our recently established
Scholarly Concentration in Cancer Biology Research and Practice. Sixty five IUSCCC investigators with previous
history of productive mentoring of undergraduate and medical students during summers and active extramurally
funded research programs will serve as mentors. Project trainees will gain enhanced laboratory and research
skills, including appreciation of the cancer research enterprise and patient care, understanding of career
opportunities, and a long-term academic relationship with mentors. Didactic lectures include basic cancer
biology, immuno-oncology, and precision therapy, and professional workshops include career opportunities,
communicating science, manuscript writing, and tumor board to round out the summer experience. An
administrative structure consisting of a principal investigator with administrative and mentoring experience, co-
investigators with program implementation, mentoring, and program evaluation experience, and a program
manager with recruitment and community outreach experience has been established along with program
assessment/refinement by internal and external advisors. A virtual summer research experience in cancer, which
we designed and implemented in 2020, will be implemented in years where public health emergencies preclude
hands-on training. SPARC continues the success of IUSCCC in administering summer research programs for
the past 20 years and expands the scope to fulfill the mission of the IUSCCC to educate students from a diverse
educational spectrum who will become ambassadors for cancer knowledge and research in their communities
and eventually become biomedical professionals who help in reducing cancer burden."

CSHL Laboratory Course in Single Cell Analysis
The proposed Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) course Single Cell Analysis to be held annually
in July 2023– 2027, is part of the CSHL’s postgraduate training program in cell and molecular biology.
This is a short, intensive 2 week hands-on course which prepares students to enter directly into
research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized molecular techniques in contemporary
aspects of singe cell-based research. General themes to be covered during the course include
quantitative single cell analysis by RNAseq, genomic DNA analysis, proteomics, and metabolomics.
Specific experimental techniques taught in the course include: 1) Droplet- and microwell based single
cell isolation; 2) Single cell RNA seq library preparation; 3) Single molecule FISH; 4) Single cell
peptidomics; 5) Single cell western blot; 6) Photoactivatable single cell probes; 7) Single cell mass
spectrometry; 8) Soft X-ray tomography; 9) Introductory single cell sequencing analysis. Experimental
techniques are taught in the context of the broader conceptual advances that they may provide. The
course invites lecturers who have made significant contributions in their fields to give up-to-the-minute
reports on current research. The trainees are chosen by the course faculty from larger pools of
applicants and range from graduate students to senior investigators and research physicians. Because
of the short duration of this course, senior, as well as junior individuals can attend and receive a short,
intense period of training in an environment remote from other demands on their time and attention.
The course also provides an unusual opportunity for established scientists to apply these advanced
techniques to their own research interests, or to retrain in an important specialty within neuroscience
with which they may not be familiar. Methods and concepts taught in the course are disseminated to
the wider research community through the publication of laboratory manuals and online resources."

Population projections made by the US Census Bureau indicate that ~20% of the population will be >65 years
old by 2030; if correct, this demographic change will have a major impact on the economy and health of our
nation. The mechanisms underlying normal and pathological human brain aging are still poorly understood,
and safe and effective therapies have yet to be developed. Therefore, the primary aim of this T32 program is to
provide students with basic, translational, and clinical research training in the Neuroscience of Aging,
Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease. The proposed T32 will provide annual support for 5 predoctoral
students and 3 postdoctoral fellows, and represent an educational cornerstone of the Healthy Aging Alliance at
Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) – an organization that involves basic and clinical researchers,
health care providers, elderly representatives from the local community, as well as an educational cornerstone
of Oregon Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (OADRC) and the OHSU Parkinson Center. Our program will
provide trainees with a “bench-to-bedside” framework in which to conduct research and better prepare them for
future research and clinical careers that focus on the development of safe and effective therapies for aging-
related neurological disorders. Based on the experience of our 21-member faculty, who have previous trained
69 pre-doctoral students and 104 postdoctoral fellows in the last 10 years, we expect that a total of 12 PhD or
PhD/MD students and 8 postdoctoral fellows will be trained during the proposed 5-year funding period.
Importantly, our program is expected to make a significant contribution to a national effort ensuring that there
will be a sufficient number of trained researchers available in the ensuing decades, with expertise in normal
and pathological human aging. Importantly, our program does not duplicate any other training program at
OHSU, and it is the only mechanism by which students can obtain comprehensive research training in the
Neuroscience of Aging, Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease in the Pacific Northwest. The T32 training
faculty bring an average of $990,772 in direct research funds as PI to OHSU each year, in support of basic,
translational, and clinical aging/neurodegeneration research. The faculty have primary appointments within the
Schools of Medicine, Nursing, and Engineering, the OADRC, the Oregon Institute of Occupational Health
Sciences (OIOHS), the Vollum Institute, the Jungers Center for Neuroscience Research, and the Oregon
National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). Thus, our program offers training using a broad spectrum of
animal models, including invertebrates, rodents, and nonhuman primates, as well as humans. It also provides
extensive Research Core support and access to a wide range of cutting-edge resources and methodologies.
The breadth of the training will be further enhanced by requiring all of our trainees to attend a comprehensive
2-term Neuroscience of Aging graduate training course, a monthly Neuroscience of Aging journal club and a
monthly Responsible Conduct in Research class, and participate in OHSU science outreach efforts."
10907428,"Project Summary:
Both warfarin and direct-acting anti-coagulants (DOACs, i.e. apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and
rivaroxaban) are widely used to prevent thrombosis due to atrial fibrillation and other clotting disorders.
Individuals receiving anticoagulants often have multiple comorbidities requiring other medications, and
exposure to multiple therapies increases the risk of bleeding due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Current
electronic health records (EHR) systems can provide warnings (i.e. alerts) about potential interactions, but
these warnings are text-based, are non-specific beyond stating the interaction is “major” or “contraindicated”;
and lack any medication or patient attributes that affect the likelihood of harm. Our team has developed and
tested a novel share decision making (SDM) tool called DDInteract, designed to reduce exposure to
anticoagulant DDIs. This tool is interoperable within existing EHR systems. Our project uses a practical,
implementation science-based approach to promote the sustainable uptake of DDInteract to reduce exposure
to clinically important anticoagulant DDIs. Through an implementation science framework, we will enable
prescribers and patients to better understand the risk/benefit calculus so they can work together to minimize
the risk of harm. Our approach is preferred over standalone web-based SDM tools because 1) DDInteract can
be seamlessly launched within the EHR without having to open and authenticate against a separate
application; 2) it automatically pulls relevant data (e.g., age, history of bleeding, other medications) from the
patient’s record to calculate a patient-specific risk; 3) it writes medication orders back to the EHR; and 4) it
automatically produces documentation for clinical notes and tailored patient instructions explaining the risk and
shared decisions made during the visit. In essence, this tool is a scalable out-of-the-box solution to the issue of
anticoagulant DDIs. The central hypothesis of this project seeks to evaluate whether DDInteract affects
exposure to potential DDIs and risk for bleeding among patients receiving an anticoagulant from before to after
implementation of DDInteract compared to providers from usual care sites. We will accomplish our objectives
and test our hypothesis by pursuing the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Examine contextual factors and define
relevant implementation strategies to facilitate integration of DDInteract within 3 University-based healthcare
systems; Specific Aim 2: Evaluate DDInteract in production/real-world situations to identify barriers and
facilitators to adoption and use of DDInteract and develop solutions to overcome those barriers; and Specific
Aim 3: Conduct a cluster randomized, multi-system trial to evaluate the effectiveness of DDInteract to mitigate
exposure to drug interactions involving oral anticoagulants. This project will greatly improve SDM for DDIs by
implementing this novel tool (DDInteract) in the participating clinics."

This postdoctoral training program based at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is in its 29th
year. The program develops researchers in substance use disorders (SUD) treatment and services to conduct
impactful research, using rigorous methods, to address the most pressing challenges in the SUD field. Our
individually-tailored and mentorship-based training model is complemented by a core curriculum and course
options to enhance trainees’ skills in clinical trials (including behavioral and pharmacological interventions) and
health services research. To date, we have trained 70+ doctoral-level psychologists, physicians, nurses, public
health, epidemiology and policy professionals for academic and research careers; 85% of those trained in the
past 10 years remain in research. In our current 5-year cycle, we have achieved a successful transition to new
PI/PD leadership, integrated a new cohort of diverse and well-funded faculty mentors working in high-priority
areas, and enhanced the research training we provide. This enables us to build on past successes while also
moving into new directions. Specifically, during the next five years, our training themes will focus on: 1) the
most current, pressing aspects of SUD/HIV prevention and care, e.g., populations most at risk of HIV infection
and poor outcomes as well as overdose; 2) strategies for advancing health equity and reducing health
disparities in populations who have been most disproportionately affected by SUD; 3) testing digital health-
based SUD treatments such as cognitive therapeutics and social media interventions in clinical trials; 4)
integrated care models and use of electronic health record (EHR) data from public and private health systems;
and 5) emerging opportunities in innovative therapeutics and delivery models, including studies to prevent
opioid overdose and to examine the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted treatment. Accordingly, the program has
integrated a range of training innovations and resources supporting these themes. The program environment
provides outstanding training resources with linkages to diverse sites, academic centers and activities that
supplement the training experience, including Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the new UCSF Weill
Institute for Neurosciences, the San Francisco VA Health Care System, the Zuckerberg San Francisco General
Hospital, and the NIDA Clinical Trials Network. The program is led by 2 Directors and 2 Site Directors, an
Executive Committee of investigators, and has guidance from a Scientific and Training Advisory Committee of
national leaders. Core faculty members include experts in psychology, psychiatry, neurology, biostatistics,
nursing, public health, and epidemiology. Faculty have strong histories of collaboration and mentorship,
extensive experience in obtaining extramural funding, and outstanding productivity in SUD treatment and
services research. Our program is ideally placed to continue its track record of success, with strategic
integration of new innovations and faculty, to train the next generation of treatment and services researchers to
conduct high-impact SUD research."

the role of ASIs in tissue architecture and responses as an under-explored dimension of cell-cell interactions.
Based on our data and the literature, we hypothesize that close-range ASIs (< 1 µm) are governed by
electrostatic charge interactions between membrane glycoproteins, while long-range ASIs (1-20 µm) function
through primary cilia which extend up from the cell surface to organize signaling pathways.
 To develop accurate methodologies to measure and characterize the forces arising between whole
sheets of cells with geometrical separation, we have designed a novel method called Bilayer Intermolecular
Force Microscopy (BIFM) to induce and measure ASIs between two opposite surfaces. BIFM will be applied to
measure the force generated between two cell layers as they approach each other from opposite sides.
 For close-range ASIs, we predict that chemicals affecting electrostatic charge interactions will modulate
force-response. Cell sheets with knockout mutations in PODXL, encoding an apical sialomucin (podocalyxin)
with proposed anti-adhesive properties, will exhibit lower resistance force in proportion to reduced electrostatic
charge repulsion. Antibodies targeting podocalyxin, in therapeutic development, will also be assessed.
 For long-range ASIs, we will determine the role of primary cilia, antenna-like organelles with sensory and
signaling functions. Using our BIFM device, we will induce ciliary ASIs and assess their effects on signaling. As
a negative control, we will employ cell lines that we have genetically engineered to ablate primary cilia (KIF3A-/-
or KIF3B-/-). We will furthermore modify our device to enable microfluidic flow to perfuse between two sheets of
cells within the BIFM at adjustable speed, to assess flow start/stop in a physiological context, and monitored for
changes in signaling activity. These studies will reveal how cilia serve as ASI sensors.
 To validate findings in vivo, we will analyze physiological tissue structures exhibiting a range of apical
surface interactions, focusing on arborized networks such as ductal trees and blood vessel plexi. Expression of
podocalyxin or cilia will be correlated with geometric properties and differential gene expression patterns.
 In summary, our project will provide novel conceptual and technical advances for understanding ASIs as
a novel dimension in tissue architecture and physiology. Cross-cutting impact includes (1) revealing functional
roles for both close-range and long-range ASIs; (2) establishing a novel biophysical device to measure
interactions between cell sheets; and (3) testing mechanisms of cell adhesion and signaling. Our prior experience
in modeling and developing biophysical tools positions us well to succeed. Collectively these activities will
establish an innovative new area for future investigation, with fundamental importance."

In 2020, there were nearly 24 million Asian Americans and 1.6 million Native Hawaiians and other Pacific
Islanders in the U.S., representing 8% of the total U.S. population, and these groups represent the fastest
growing U.S. population group over the past decade. Yet, few data exist about the contemporary epidemiology
of major cardiovascular diseases and explanatory variables between different Asian American, Native
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) subgroups in large, representative U.S. populations and compared
with non-Hispanic Whites. As highlighted in NOT-HL-23-001 (Epidemiologic studies in Asian Americans, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders), there is a pressing need to fill these key knowledge gaps given the
substantial heterogeneity between these different subpopulations in a variety of exposures that may potentially
contribute to differential rates of cardiovascular diseases and reflect opportunities to improve care and
outcomes. We propose to address many of these knowledge gaps through the PAcific Islander, Native
Hawaiian and Asian American Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology (PANACHE) Study which will leverage
collaborations between the Kaiser Permanente Northern California and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii integrated
healthcare delivery systems whose collective AANHPI adult population is >800,000 and non-Hispanic white
population of >1.7 million between 2012 and 2021. The specific aims of the PANACHE Study are (1) to
delineate the contemporary incidences of heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and myocardial infarction (MI)
among different AANHPI subpopulations compared with non-Hispanic Whites; (2) to develop and validate
novel predictive models for incident HF, AF and MI within AANHPI subpopulations; and (3) to characterize self-
reported sociocultural, behavioral, dietary and environmental factors across AANHPI subpopulations and their
association with clinical cardiovascular risk factors and overall predicted risks of incident HF, AF and MI, along
with establishing a linked data and specimen biorepository using remote blood collection methods. Overall, the
PANACHE Study brings together a highly experienced multidisciplinary team with complimentary expertise in
cardiovascular disease and evaluating ethnic differences, use of electronic health records and other data
sources, and advanced predictive analytics; as well as access to and success in engaging large populations of
AANHPI adults in Hawaii and Northern California. The PANACHE Study will increase our understanding of the
epidemiology and contributing factors to major cardiovascular diseases in support of the goal to improve the
quality of care and outcomes for these understudied patient subgroups."

Vestibular dysfunction becomes more prevalent with age and it is estmated that more than 80% of people over
80 years old experience dysfunction5. Furthermore, approximately 8 million adults in the US suffer from
balance impairment due to damage to the peripheral vestibular system, but effective treatments for balance
dysfunction are virtually non-existent. Vestibular hair cells within vestibular canal and otolith organs convert
hair bundle motion into receptor potentials and sensory information is relayed to the brain by action potentials
in vestibular afferent nerves. Afferents in central zones of vestibular neuroepithelia exhibit different responses
to vestibular stimuli than afferents in peripheral zones. There are three types of vestibular afferents: calyx-only
afferents innervate one or more type I hair cells, bouton dendrites innervate type II hair cells and dimorphic
afferents contact both hair cell types. Calyx-only afferents are present only in central zones and have irregular
firing patterns, whereas dimorphic afferents exist in both zones and have regular firing patterns. We will study
age-related dysfunction in calyx-bearing afferents in gerbil vestibular organs using novel preparations
developed in the laboratories of the principal investigators. We will use electrophysiological, hair bundle
stimulation, immunohistochemical and behavioral approaches to address age-related changes in mature and
aged vestibular epithelia. In Aim 1 we will determine if functional changes in vestibular hair cell
mechanotransduction and/or basolateral currents occur with age. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that synaptic
degeneration of calyx terminals will manifest as morphological uncoupling of type I hair cells from their
associated calyces and deficits in vestibular evoked responses and behaviors. In Aim 3 we will directly
investigate changes at the type I hair cell/calyx synapse by recording spontaneous activity and responses to
hair bundle stimulation in mature and aged calyx afferents. Our investigative team is uniquely positioned to
carry out the proposed studies. Results from this work will provide new information on how the aging process
impacts peripheral vestibular signals and may inform development of vestibular neurotherapeutics targeting
afferent nerves in order to restore normal vestibular function."
10814148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) still is the leading cause of death in the United States. The demand for novel
treatments lead to the recent discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), which promotes the
degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to increase atherogenic lipoprotein LDL cholesterol (LDL-
C) levels. Many treatments targeting PCSK9 have been developed but have limited efficacy in lowing LDL-
C. This proposal fills the critical knowledge gap by challenging the underlying presumption that RXRα is essential
to regulate the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD) patients. RXRα is
the core nuclear receptor, which always is considered to constitutively forms heterodimerization with other
nuclear receptors. Our preliminary data showed that hepatic depletion of RXRα leads to hepatic lipid
accumulation and PCSK9 induction, which can be abolished by AAV8-mediated hepatic overexpression of RXRα.
Consistently, we observed the increased cholesterol and LDL-C in the plasma of RXRα hepatocyte-specific
knockout (hepKO) mice, and hepatic overexpression of RXRα can significantly reduce the plasma cholesterol
and LDL-C levels. These preliminary data bring two scientific questions needed to be determined in this proposal:
1) why RXRα deficiency has primary effects on the PPARα signaling pathway; 2) how RXRα regulates PCSK9
expression in the liver. To find answers, we focus on elucidating the effects of RXRα protein post-translational
modification (PTM) on managing the partnership with PPARα and regulating PCSK9. Recently, we identified a
previously unrecognized acetylation residue of RXRα, which controls the heterodimerization between RXRα and
PPARα. The inhibitory effects of RXRα constitutively acetylated mutant further indicate that acetylation of RXRα
is essential for preventing the induction of PCSK9 in the liver of RXRα hepKO mice. Our data are the first to
show that RXRα is acetylated by CBP, and TNFα, the inflammatory cytokine presented in the NALFD liver,
impairs the CBP-mediated acetylation of RXRα. Interestingly, we also observed the decreased acetylation of
RXRα in the liver of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and human NAFLD patients. These results suggest a central
hypothesis that RXRα acetylation is required for regulating the PPARα-mediated transcription of PCSK9 in the
liver, and impaired RXRα acetylation in the NAFLD liver results in the increased cholesterol and LDL-C. We will
test this hypothesis with the following two aims: Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanism by which RXRα
regulates the transcription of PCSK9 in the liver; Aim 2: Determine if and the extent to which RXRα acetylation
is a resilience factor to prevent the induction of PCSK9 and cholesterol in the fatty liver. Successful completion
of studies proposed in this proposal will identify the mechanisms by which acetylated RXRα coordinates with
PPARα to regulate PCSK9 transcription and prevent obesity-promoted hypercholesterolemia. This identification
will allow for the development of new alternative strategies for attenuating PCSK9 induction in the NAFLD liver,
which will help mitigate CVD risk, an NIH's mission directive."

Gestational diabetes is characterized by chronic maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy without a prior
diagnosis of diabetes. It is a very common obstetric complication affecting ~10-25% pregnant women globally.
Because women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have other pregnancy complications, deliver large
for gestational or premature babies, and develop type II diabetes, gestational diabetes poses a serious threat
to the health of mother and baby. Although some risk factors have been defined, the underlying mechanisms
are complex and the precise etiologies are poorly understood. Recent studies show that pancreatic serotonin
signaling plays a critical role in maternal glucose homeostasis. Increased serotonin synthesis in the pancreatic
islet is a critical event that promotes beta cell proliferation and increased insulin secretion that are needed to
prevent maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy. Dietary and genetic factors that reduce islet serotonin
synthesis are causatively linked to gestational diabetes in mice. Our preliminary studies show that low dose
exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is associated with reduced abundance of serotonin and its critical
cofactor vitamin B6 in the pancreas from pregnant C57BL/6 mouse. These results are consistent with
epidemiological findings that PFOA exposure in pregnant women is linked to maternal hyperglycemia, insulin
resistance, and glucose intolerance. Interestingly, DBA/2J mice exposed to PFOA do not develop gestational
diabetes. The C57BL/6 and DBA/2J mice differ in their abilities to metabolize vitamin B6 due to differences in
activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). These results suggest that environmental exposure-induced
gestational diabetes is modulated by genetic background and higher endogenous vitamin B6 level confers a
protection. The overall hypothesis is that PFOA exposure in pregnant mice is causatively linked to gestational
diabetes through mechanisms that perturb serotonin metabolism in maternal pancreatic islets and the effects
are modulated by genetic differences in vitamin B6 bioavailability. We propose to investigate beta cell
proliferation and serotonin abundance in control and PFOA-exposed pregnant C57BL/6 mice to determine
whether the gestational diabetes is causatively linked to reduced beta cell expansion and reduced insulin
secretion. We also wish to investigate whether treatment with an ALP inhibitor in the DBA/2J pregnant mice will
reduce vitamin B6 in pancreatic islets and result in loss of protection to gestational diabetes. Finally, to
determine how pregnancy and gestational diabetes influence islet programming, we will perform RNA
sequencing and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation followed by sequencing to study changes in the
transcriptome and epigenome in response to physiological changes and disease. The proposed research will
provide knowledge on mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes that benefit public health."
10846776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myeloid cell-mediated immune suppression is one of the major factors responsible for resistance to anti-
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. Glioblastoma (GBM), a brain tumor with a dismal prognosis
with current standard-of-care therapy, is enriched with immune-suppressive myeloid cell subsets in its tumor
microenvironment and shows resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop
strategies to overcome myeloid-derived immune suppression in order to provide durable clinical benefits of anti-
PD-1 therapy in patients with GBM. Epigenetic machinery plays a key role in myeloid cell differentiation and
establishing specific functional profiles. However, the impact of epigenetic regulation of intra-tumoral myeloid
cells on resistance to immunotherapy has remained unexplored. The overall objective of the current proposal
is to identify key epigenetic factors regulating immune-suppressive pathways and develop a novel strategy
targeting the epigenetic regulator(s) to reverse myeloid-derived immune suppression in GBM.
In our preliminary studies, we noted that immune-suppressive myeloid cell subsets in human GBM tumors have
high expression of an epigenetic enzyme - histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase (KDM6B). GBM tumor-bearing mice
carrying myeloid-cell specific Kdm6b deletion demonstrated improved survival. Additionally, the absence of
Kdm6b increased chromatin accessibility and expression of genes associated with proinflammatory pathways
including interferon response, phagocytic ability, and antigen-presentation in intratumoral macrophages and
dendritic cells. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of KDM6B with GSK-J4, a small molecule inhibitor,
enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in GL261 tumor-bearing mice with increased infiltration of effector T
cells. Based on the preliminary findings, we hypothesize that KDM6B inhibition reprograms immune-
suppressive myeloid cells into a proinflammatory phenotype, thereby enhancing T cell-mediated anti-tumor
immunity to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in GBM. In the current proposal, we will test our hypothesis
using three specific aims: 1) To determine the mechanism of KDM6B-mediated functional and epigenetic
regulation of phagocytosis and antigen presentation; 2) To identify the role of KDM6B in myeloid cell-mediated
regulation of T cell function and localization; and 3) To evaluate the therapeutic potential of KDM6B inhibition in
reversing the resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The research is innovative in the applicant’s opinion because this
proposal will be one of the first to provide systems-level understanding of the role of epigenetic regulation of
myeloid cell biology at a single-cell resolution in GBM. The proposed research is significant since it will
investigate a novel strategy of targeting the epigenetic machinery to overcome myeloid cell-derived immune
resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in GBM. The long-term goal of this research endeavor is to develop
personalized immunotherapies with epigenetic modulators in a tumor-specific manner."
10829414,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure is widespread. Drinking water is considered a primary
source of exposure, and high levels of PFAS are found in many communities, sparking concerns about health
impacts on these populations. We have demonstrated high PFAS levels in drinking water in Pittsboro, NC. The
residents in this city are currently experiencing disparate exposures of PFAS. However, the potential health risks
associated with these exposures are not well understood. In addition, very little is known about the toxicity of
“emerging” PFAS, including perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), which are increasingly detected in the
environmment and within humans. We have demonstrated the reproductive toxicity of PFBS. Epidemiological
studies, supported by findings from toxicological studies, provide strong evidence that humans exposed to the
PFAS legacy compounds are at risk for immunosuppression, including reduced antibody response to vaccination
in children. Notably, there are lack of relevant data assessing the effects of exposure to emerging PFAS
chemicals or PFAS mixtures and immunotoxicity in early life such as during pregnancy and lactation. In this
proposal, we will test our hypothesis that maternal PFAS exposure results in reduced immune response to
vaccination, during pregnancy in dams and in offspring after birth through altered cellular immunity and gut
microbiota; decreased antibody transfer from dams to offspring through placenta and breast milk by disrupting
endocrine signaling and antibobdy transfer receptors. Our specific aims are to: 1) Investigate maternal PFAS
exposure and its effects on immune response to vaccination in dams and placental transfer of IgG from maternal
to fetal compartment; 2) Examine the effects of maternal PFAS exposure on offspring through breastfeeding and
antibody transfer and identify underlying mechanisms; 3) Determine the impact of maternal PFAS exposure on
the establishment of gut microbiota and immune response to vaccination in offspring. This study is novel because
we will address health impacts of PFAS mixtures mimicking highly contaminated community drinking water and
an emerging PFAS compound, whereas most previous studies focused on legacy compounds; Although rodents
are a commonly used model for immunotoxicity studies, rabbits are a more suitable animal model for
investigating both maternal transfer of antibodies to the offspring and the development of the immune system
during early life, including establishment of gut microbiota and immune response to vaccination. This study will
provide new insights into the impact of perinatal PFAS exposure from breast-feeding and the subsequent health
effects in offspring. Feasibility: The combination of expertise and preliminary studies provide a strong foundation
for this proposal. Dr. Feng’s lab has established the perinatal PFAS exposure rabbit model; this proposal is an
extension of her K01 project. Drs. Staats and Landon have extensive experience working with rabbits, such as
immune responses to a variety of vaccinations in rabbits. Dr. Fenton has three decades of experience with
mammary gland development, lactation, and toxicity in animal models, most of which pertains to PFAS exposure.
Dr. Ji is an expert in analyzing single-cell sequencing and metagenomics data. Our study will make significant
contributions to our understanding of the health impacts of PFAS and provide evidence to support regulations."

Candidate: I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Richard White at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center. My research career has focused on how cells interact and communicate, beginning with my
PhD research into how skin cells coordinate rapid wound healing in the embryonic epidermis, and continuing
into my postdoctoral research on how tumor and microenvironment cells interact during melanoma invasion.
My recent publication uncovered a novel “interface” cell state adopted by both tumor and microenvironment
cells at the tumor boundary, distinguished by upregulation of cilia. The objective of this proposal is to determine
the contribution of the cilia-enriched interface cell state to melanoma invasion. Ultimately, my long-term goal is
to lead an independent group studying how tumor and microenvironment cells cooperate to promote
melanoma progression. To accomplish these goals, I have developed a career plan to: (1) develop new
scientific and technical skills; (2) become an effective leader and mentor; (3) extend my professional network of
advisors and collaborators; (4) successfully transition to an independent role.
Research: Recent advances in treating melanoma, including targeted therapies and immunotherapy,
demonstrate how an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of melanoma progression and the role of the
tumor microenvironment (TME) can lead to novel therapeutics. Interactions between tumor and TME cells
often promote melanoma progression. My recent work identified a novel cilia-enriched “interface” cell state
adopted by tumor and microenvironment cells at the tumor boundary, and found that cilia are required for
melanoma invasion. This indicates that the interface cell state may have a critical role in melanoma
progression. To investigate the role of the interface in invasion, I will accomplish the following specific aims: (1)
determine the mechanism by which cilia promote invasion; (2) investigate how cilia gene expression is
regulated; (3) identify the mechanisms that establish the interface cell state.
Environment: During the mentored phase, the proposed work will be completed at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC), one of the world’s leading cancer centers with a history of major discoveries in
cancer biology. The research will be performed in the White laboratory within Sloan Kettering Institute, the
research arm of MSKCC, led by Dr. Joan Massagué. The White laboratory is a member of the Cancer Biology
and Genetics Program within Sloan Kettering Institute, a program led by my co-mentor Dr. Scott Lowe.
Between my mentor, co-mentor, advisory committee, and collaborators, I have assembled an outstanding team
of experts in basic and translational cancer research who will guide this work and assist with achieving my
scientific and professional goals during the transition to independence."

This is a 5-year mentored K08 award to facilitate the transition of Dr. Neel Pasricha, an ophthalmologist with
cornea subspecialty training, to an independent investigator in ocular surface eye translational research. A
strong group of experienced mentors at UCSF, scientific advisors, and didactic work will assist Dr. Pasricha’s
research skills transfer, including training in ocular surface electrophysiology, human corneal epithelial cell
culture models, high-throughput screening for small-molecule drug discovery, experimental mouse models,
and human subject clinical studies.
The research is focused on dry eye disease (DED), a major unmet need in ophthalmology characterized by
impaired tear film homeostasis accompanied by ocular symptoms. There are currently just four FDA-approved
therapies for DED, each targeting only the inflammatory pathway and having limited efficacy. The ocular
surface, comprised of the cornea and conjunctiva, is lined by stratified epithelial cells expressing ion transport
proteins that facilitate active fluid secretion or absorption to regulate tear fluid volume and osmolarity. The goal
of the proposed research is to discover and advance drug candidates to promote tear fluid secretion
by epithelial cells lining the ocular surface.
This research utilizes a novel ocular surface potential difference (OSPD) method introduced in animal studies
and advanced for use in humans during my residency at UCSF. OSPD measures the electrical potential
difference generated across epithelia from apical and basal membrane ion transporters. In Aim 1, in vivo
OSPD measurements in mice will investigate the role of ion transporters in ocular surface fluid transport, with
particular focus on chloride and potassium channels. Aim 2 will use ex vivo high-throughput screening in
primary human corneal epithelial cell cultures and in vivo experimental mouse studies to advance potential
drug candidates that target calcium-activated chloride channels to increase tear fluid secretion for treatment of
DED. Aim 3 will use in vivo human OSPD measurements in healthy adults to test a pro-secretory drug
candidate in phase 2 clinical trial that activates the CFTR chloride channel. The long-term career
development goal is to build a robust cross-disciplinary research program that advances the
fundamental understanding of ocular surface ion transport and translates that knowledge into novel
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ocular surface diseases, including DED."
10761796,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 REM sleep is accompanied by dreams characterized by vivid visual experience, which evidently indicates
that our brain holds a generative model of the world. Converging studies suggest that we perceive the world
through such a generative model and the abnormal expression of the model could underlie some psychiatric
disorders. Thus, it is important to understand how our brain supports the generative model. The goal of this
project is to elucidate the neurophysiological basis for the generative model by focusing on the neuronal
activity during REM sleep, during which the brain’s generative model is detached from the external world.
 In the mentored phase of the award, I first propose to investigate rapid eye movements as a readout of the
generative model during REM sleep. Rapid eye movements during REM sleep are proposed to represent
active sampling of the virtual visual environment of dreams. However, this hypothesis is poorly supported by
physiological evidence. To provide physiological evidence to test the hypothesis, I will focus on the activity of
the head direction (HD) cells, which code for the animals’ HD relative to the environment. The activity pattern
of HD cells during REM sleep is similar to what is observed during wake. This makes it possible to decode
virtual HD during REM sleep. I will test whether rapid eye movements during REM sleep can predict changes
in HD decoded from HD cells recorded in the anterodorsal thalamus. To achieve this goal, I will combine large
scale electrophysiological recordings, advanced decoding methods, and miniaturized eye tracking systems.
 In the R00 phase, I propose to investigate the superior colliculus (SC) as the neuronal substrate for virtual
head orienting and rapid eye movements during REM sleep. The SC is an important hub for head and eye
orienting in awake animals. I will test whether spontaneous activity in the SC during REM sleep predicts
changes in virtual HD by simultaneously recording neuronal activity in the SC and in the anterodorsal thalamus
as well as monitoring rapid eye movements. I will further test the causal impact of the SC activity on virtual
head orienting and rapid eye movements by activating and inactivating the SC during REM sleep.
 In summary, this project will provide new insights into the neurophysiological understanding of how the
generative model of the world and our interaction with it is organized during REM sleep. This will constitute the
critical step to understand how we see the world through the internal model and how the abnormal expression
of the model could underlie the pathogenesis of some psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.
 The technical and scientific expertise that I will acquire during the training period of the award will be crucial
for setting the basis of research programs in my own independent laboratory focusing on the role of the SC in
orchestrating the generative model during REM sleep. In addition to this, intense career development training,
the guidance from the mentoring team, as well as the collaboration and the rich intellectual interaction in the
UCSF neuroscience community will ensure my successful transition into an independent investigator."

In this K23 proposal, Dr. Andrea Jakubowski, an addiction medicine physician, describes a 4-year mentored
research project and a rigorous career development plan that will help establish her as an independent
clinician investigator who uses implementation science (IS) to design and study interventions to improve the
health of people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Injectable buprenorphine (iBUPE) is a safe, evidence-based
treatment for OUD that provides continuous levels of buprenorphine for 4-6 weeks. Clinical trials with iBUPE
demonstrate high treatment retention, reductions in illicit opioid use, and improvements in quality of life for
persons with OUD. iBUPE may be especially useful for patients with psychosocial barriers to self-administering
daily sublingual buprenorphine, the most commonly prescribed formulation. However, there is limited iBUPE
uptake in real-world settings, likely due to health systems and patient level barriers. Thus, in a rigorous
implementation study, over a 30-month period, we will use well-established IS methods to implement iBUPE in
one primary care clinic and one ""low-threshold"" clinic (based in a syringe services program) with the following
aims: Aim 1: To identify iBUPE pre-implementation determinants and develop implementation
strategies; Aim 2: To pilot, refine, and evaluate iBUPE implementation strategies; Aim 3: To examine
gaps in care following iBUPE implementation. For Aim 1, guided by Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research, we will use data from focus groups with staff and persons with OUD to identify
iBUPE pre-implementation determinants. We will then develop and select implementation strategies that
address these determinants. For Aim 2, we will use rapid cycle testing to pilot and refine implementation
strategies. We will then use the Proctor framework to evaluate implementation outcomes (acceptability,
adoption, feasibility and fidelity) using staff focus groups and data from study logs and the electronic health
record (EHR). In Aim 3, we will use EHR data to establish ""cascades of care"" for iBUPE treatment, identifying
gaps in iBUPE delivery beginning with interest in iBUPE and ending with treatment retention at 6 months. We
will examine patient-level barriers that contribute to gaps in the care cascade by conducting 40-80 qualitative
interview with patients who are offered iBUPE then experience different outcomes (decline iBUPE, interested
but do not initiate, initiate but are not retained in treatment at 3 months, initiate and are retained at 6 months).
We will use these data to develop generalizable iBUPE implementation manuals that we will test in a future
R01 study of scaling iBUPE implementation in a network of LT and PC clinics. To accomplish these aims, Dr.
Jakubowski will pursue training in application of IS frameworks, qualitative methods for IS research, and
stakeholder-engaged research. In doing so, she will achieve her goal of becoming an independent clinician
investigator who uses IS to design and study interventions to improve the health of people with OUD."

The goal of our project is to finalize, validate, and prepare for regulatory approvals a device and probe for
delivering localized, controlled therapeutic hypothermia to the inner ear. The device safety and efficacy will be
tested for residual hearing preservation in cochlear implant surgeries by comparing pre- and post-operative
hearing outcomes and intra-operative electrophysiological measurements. Extensive preclinical research was
enabled by a NIDCD R21 and industry support that allowed development of a protocol for hypothermia delivery
using a device and probe suitable for a rodent model. We propose here to re-engineer the device and probe for
clinical implantation in the operating room, and prepare it for regulatory approval. We will also carry out first-in-
patient studies for the therapy by implementing localized, therapeutic hypothermia for protection of hair cells and
neural substrate during cochlear implantation. This approach brings a non-pharmaceutical therapy for residual
hearing preservation to the market. Furthermore, hypothermia localized to the inner ear avoids challenges with
systemic cooling or with delivery of drugs to the inner ear. The device and probe do not require alteration of the
surgical approach or the implant electrode. The specific aims are motivated by our preclinical studies that have
shown that hypothermia can preserve residual hearing long-term post-cochlear implantation. Ensuring the
survival of sensitive hair cells and neural structures in the cochlea will lead to improved residual hearing
preservation, which in the long-term can improve speech perception outcomes."

modified mRNA vaccines (Project 1 – Vaccine Development). This effort is accelerated and guided by
projects exploring strain diversity and microbial ecology (Project 2 – Antigen Discovery) and the mucosal
adaptive immune response to natural infection (Project 3 – Immunology). Supporting these three projects are
two scientific cores that will provide expertise, technical skills, and analysis of large deep-sequencing datasets
(Core B - Genomics Core), and collect samples for a patient cohort (Core C - Clinical Core). Core A
(Administrative Core) is the logistical and organizational component of the program that will handle regular
inter-project communication and ensure seamless exchange of data and information. Core A (Administrative
Core) is co-led by the mVACS program directors Dr. Bushman and Dr. Weissman. Their primary objectives will
be to monitor the scientific progress of the program, oversee distribution of resources, stimulate project

and genetic variation, and associate these with outcomes. Core B will support analysis of protein structure to
allow expression of well-folded domains as mRNAs. Core B will characterize DNA inversion systems and other
mechanisms of DNA modification and alterations in gene activity that may impact vaccine efficacy. Core B will
also carry out transcriptional profiling on C. difficile isolated from the intestine of vaccinated and immunodeficient
mice, to assess how C. difficile responds in vivo to effective and ineffective immune responses. The Aims of
Core B are: (1) C. difficile genomics to identify optimal targets for modified mRNA vaccines. Long read and short
read data will be merged to generate complete assemblies, as in our previous work. Gene content will be
enumerated and compared with clinical outcomes. (2) To assess variation in sequence and abundance of C.
difficile vaccine targets. C. difficile isolates are known to encode considerable variation in their surface proteins.
In addition, DNA inversion systems encode on-off switches affecting surface proteins and transcription factors,
resulting in extensive population heterogeneity. This Aim will thus carry out deep assessment of proteins relevant
as modified mRNA vaccine targets, and guide antigen design. (3) Transcriptional profiling and microbiome
sequencing for mechanistic investigation. Projects 1-3 and the Clinical Core will generate murine and human
fecal samples associated with successful or unsuccessful responses to C. difficile infection; Core B will quantify
microbiome composition and metatranscriptomic analysis of C. difficile positive samples by RNA-seq. This core
will oversee sequence acquisition and analysis is support of these studies. (4) Data management and archiving.
Core C will work with Core A for standard statistical analysis and will archive and manage the diverse data types
generated by the U19 team."

rates, based on metabolic demand to maintain homeostasis. Continuous fulfillment of this energy
demand depends on sufficient nutrient supply, sensing nutrient availability, metabolizing and
converting into chemical energy. In eukaryotic cells energy, in the form of ATP, is mainly produced
by mitochondria. Not only how much total ATP is generated, local energy level is also important
for cells to carry out critical functions, such as neuronal activity, cell migration, tumor cell invasion,
wound healing, and immunity. Intracellular transport and positioning of mitochondria shape
spatiotemporal heterogeneity in ATP distribution. My overall goal is to understand the molecular
pathways regulating the interplay between cellular metabolism, mitochondrial positioning and
function. The estimated mitochondrial protein number is ~1,300 for mammalian cells. Post-
translational modifications can further magnify the functional diversity of proteins. Metabolic flux-
sensitive post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, uniquely couple nutrient status to
cellular metabolism and signaling pathways. While my research will be focused on O-
GlcNAcylation-dependent regulation of mitochondrial functions and inter-organelle
communications, systematic analysis of metabolic enzyme functions within the intracellular space
will add extra dimension to our understanding of metabolic pathways. Our experiments will
decipher the metabolic biochemistry and metabolite kinetics within the context of cellular
architecture. My interdisciplinary research program is poised to reveal fundamental insights into
the mechanisms that orchestrate the nutrient and energy supply, and pinpoint the underlying
causes of energy impairments that lead to diseases."
10833538,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the proposed MIRA-funded research portfolio is to discover how dynamic interactions between
individual biomolecules at the nanoscale influence their collective function and organization in complex
biophysical processes. The proposed research program integrates continued development of 6D single-
molecule (SM) imaging (3D positions and 3D orientations) with mechanistic studies of the organization of
biomolecular interactions at the nanoscale. Importantly, the proposed scientific goals synergistically spur the
development of impactful imaging capabilities, and these new capabilities will in-turn overcome barriers to enable
novel significant scientific trajectories to be pursued. Four broad research thrusts will be pursued.
Thrust 1 will develop smart adaptive 6D nanoscopy. Previous studies have shown that fixed imaging systems
cannot measure all possible molecular rotational motions with the best-possible quantum-limited precision. Thus,
dynamic illumination and fluorescence modulation hardware will be integrated to enable the imaging system to
adapt as data is collected. Fusing model-driven design algorithms with data-driven deep learning methods will
yield smart microscopes that enable measurements that are not possible even with current state-of-the-art
nanoscopes. Thrust 2 will develop high-speed 6D SM tracking to map spatial heterogeneities in molecular
interactions between biomolecules. These heterogeneities govern important processes like phase separation,
but current techniques have sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to resolve mechanistic details. Time-varying
illumination, single-photon counting, and direct pupil imaging will be integrated to visualize these dynamics using
10x fewer emission photons and thus 10x faster speed than state-of-the art methods.
Thrust 3 will leverage developments in 6D nanoscopy to elucidate dynamic molecular architectures of self-
assembling peptides and natural amyloidogenic proteins. Critically, scientists must disentangle the effects of
peptide sequence, secondary structure, assembly architecture, and aggregation conditions to create new
biomaterials for diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as to elucidate the mechanisms of cytotoxicity in amyloid
diseases. The 6D positions and orientations of transiently binding fluorophores will visualize the dynamic
organization of individual peptide assemblies both in vitro and as they interact with living cells with nanoscale
resolution. Thrust 4 will leverage developments in 6D SM tracking to visualize heterogeneous network
architectures within biomolecular condensates that ensemble measurements fail to detect. The 6D positions and
orientations of fluorogenic probes will be used to characterize the network architecture of stickers and spacers
within the condensate, thereby visualizing the driving forces of phase separation. Six-dimensional SM nanoscopy
will also directly observe how proteins are recruited and reorganized throughout the phase separation process,
leading to mechanistic insights into the formation and spatiotemporal evolution of biomolecular condensates."
10849794,"Abstract
The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply state-of-the-art machine learning and
molecular modeling tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for
therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and biological
networks, and their mis-regulations lead to diseases states. Thus PPIs are biologically compelling targets for
drug discovery. Despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain
challenging for therapeutic intervention. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural
features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often
transient and involve multivalent contacts. One of the most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategies is to
use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature.
PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of
contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the
total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often
lower than the cognate full-length proteins. In last five years, we have significantly advanced a pocket-guided
rational design approach based on AlphaSpace to tackle this challenge. We have successfully optimized a
PDM to target the KIX domain of the p300/CBP coactivator by introducing non-natural amino acids to improve
pocket-fragment binding; rationally designed a novel NEMO coiled coil mimic that disrupts virus-induced NF-κB
signaling and induces cell death; and successfully targeted a new binding pocket on MDM2 and MDMX with a
potent dual inhibitor by elaborating hydrogen-bond stabilized alpha-helix mimetics. Meanwhile, we have
developed state-of-the-art scoring functions for protein-ligand docking as well as virtual screening, advanced
deep learning models to predict molecular properties and chemical reactions, and established strong and
fruitful collaborations with several outstanding experimental labs in chemical biology and biophysics to discover
new modulators of biomolecular interactions. These significant advances set the stage for us to further push
the frontier of integrating machine learning and molecular modeling for rational drug design. Our focus in the
next few years will be to establish a robust pocket-guided design platform based on AlphaSpace and machine
learning for PPI orthosteric inhibitor optimization, provide physical/chemical insights and develop novel
computational strategies for allosteric modulator discovery, and explore chemical space with deep
sequence/graph/geometric representation learning for multi-objective molecular design. Our modulator design
efforts in close collaborations with our experimental colleagues will not only rigorously test predictive power of
our developed methods in real life applications, but also result in highly specific and potent modulators towards
several important but challenging therapeutic targets, providing new leads for drug development."
10833623,"Project Summary
 Bacteria frequently encounter stresses including nutrient starvation, temperature changes, and
antibiotic assault, which could easily throw their intracellular environment into chaos. To survive and
to adapt, bacteria developed diverse stress responses to regulate intracellular processes
accordingly. While the transcriptional networks governing stress responses have been extensively
characterized, there are major gaps in our knowledge beyond transcription regulation. The theme of
my research is to elucidate stress signaling mechanisms that are transmitted by rapid changes in
concentration of ‘alarmones’ – signaling nucleotides which are instrumental for alerting cells about
stresses in a timely manner. My laboratory has extensive experience in characterizing the conserved
alarmone (p)ppGpp. (p)ppGpp is induced by stresses and mediates profound, pleiotropic
physiological changes in almost all bacteria to allow fitness, survival, and evolution. We identified
multiple purine synthesis enzymes, a replication enzyme and a transcription repressor that are
directly regulated by (p)ppGpp in Gram-positive Bacillus species. These regulations were further
found to be conserved in many pathogens and are critical for homeostasis, starvation resistance,
antibiotic persistence, and genome integrity. Currently, we are also investigating how (p)ppGpp
regulates the switch between distinct bacterial lifestyles: planktonic growth and biofilm formation.
Additionally, we detected other nucleotide alarmones including AppppA, pGpp, ppApp, and c-di-
AMP, which are induced by different stresses including temperature and cell wall stress, to form a
robust protective network. Our future research will answer the following fundamental questions: How
are the different alarmones triggered by different stresses, and how do bacteria synthesize them?
What are the direct interaction targets of different alarmones, and how do they promote bacterial
fitness and influence bacterial development such as biofilm formation and sporulation? How do
bacteria integrate multiple cues from different alarmones for rapid and appropriate adaptation to
diverse environments? We combine metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics with
biochemical and cell biological approaches to answer these questions. We obtained a list of
alarmone targets from systematic screens performed with the proteome of the pathogen Bacillus
anthracis. We will study these processes in the related non-pathogenic bacterium Bacillus subtilis
for which we have extensive experience. B. subtilis grows fast and is highly amenable to genetic
manipulation. The nucleotide signaling mechanisms we characterize in Bacillus are applicable to
other, less tractable, pathogenic bacteria, and can be used for developing antimicrobial strategies
by targeting their stress responses."

Research in the PI’s laboratory focuses on metabolism, with applications in systems and synthetic
biology. The lab has two main goals: to study and model metabolic dynamics and regulation, and
to develop minimal-equipment biosensors for nutritional deficiencies for deployment to resource-
poor environments. The biosensor work has broad potential global utility and impact, and also
motivates some of the systems biology analyses they perform. Those metabolic studies lie at the
interface of computation and experiment, and are unified via their use of metabolomics. His group
uses temporal metabolomics measurements to capture the metabolic dynamics of biological
systems, and then uses these data for analysis, understanding, and engineering of those
biological systems. In parallel, they develop computational tools to better exploit metabolomics
data, with an aim towards applying those data to new metabolic modeling frameworks.
In the next five years, the PI will tackle some of the most significant yet understudied challenges
in cell-free systems, the group’s current platform of choice for the development of field-deployable
biosensors. In the past five years he has been a trailblazer at the interface of systems biology and
cell-free synthetic biology, discovering that residual endogenous metabolism in lysate-based cell-
free systems is critical in determining the total productivity of a given reaction. He will expand
upon that discovery to fully characterize the impacts of endogenous metabolism on cell-free
systems, and to move towards solving what is currently the key challenge to broader adoption
and use of cell-free systems: early termination of expression in reactions. He will use a host of
systems-scale tools, including metabolomics, proteomics, and fluxomics, to create a
comprehensive (and the only) systems-scale characterization of metabolism in cell-free systems,
and will complement these efforts with metabolic modeling and analysis to gain greater insight
into the inner workings of the system.
The PI’s overall vision is of a deeper understanding of cell-free systems that allows them to go to
the next level in terms of adoption, applications, and impact. He also envisions significant
biological insight coming from these cell-derived but cell-free systems, including the ability to
discover regulatory interactions that might otherwise be masked by epistatic effects in vivo. He
envisions the results of his work being exploited by biologists and bioengineers to enable more
effective in vitro models of biological systems as well as biotechnological advances that were
previously either scientifically or economically infeasible."

Sciences Training Program (PSTP). The goal of the PSTP is to develop a diverse pool of well-trained biomedical
scientists who have the technical, operational and professional skills to conduct pharmacological research in an
ethically responsible and rigorous manner, and to enter diverse careers in the biomedical research
workforce. Annual support for 12 trainees (6-Year 2 and 6-Year 3 Trainees in any one year) is requested
throughout the five years of funding. The U-M PSTP is a long-standing collaboration between the Medical School
and the College of Pharmacy that provides synergistic, translational education, research training, and career
development for pre-doctoral trainees in four degree-granting programs: Pharmacology, Biological Chemistry,
Medicinal Chemistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The new, competency-based PSTP curriculum, which
includes an experiential program in Real-World Drug Discovery, is designed to provide trainees with a strong
foundational understanding of the pharmacological sciences, to provide training in the performance of rigorous
and reproducible research, and to provide career development, teamwork, and leadership training, all under the
direction of well-trained and dedicated faculty mentors. An extensive and successful alumni base provides
career mentorship, networking, and future employment opportunities. PSTP mentors encourage trainees to think
broadly about research problems in human disease while focusing their thesis research on a critical, unmet gap
in knowledge using rigorous experimental design and methods. This re-designed strong, interdisciplinary, yet
individualized, training in the pharmacological sciences will give trainees a distinct advantage in that they will be
rapidly employable and well positioned to contribute to the NIH mission to discover new medicines. The
development of novel and effective therapeutic agents is a critical, on-going global need that requires rigorously
trained, innovative team players to solve critical problems in health care. It is essential that the US continue to
produce doctoral-level scientists from diverse backgrounds with broad training in pharmacological sciences and
experimental therapeutics who understand basic science and translational medicine. U-M is a premiere
institution in research and training of graduate students in the biomedical sciences on a global scale. Although
U-M has individual graduate programs in the Departments associated with this training program, the PSTP is
the only program at U-M that draws upon the expertise of faculty, alumni, the Michigan Drug Discovery Institute,

career development, and team-based approaches to innovation and translation in target discovery and
development of experimental therapeutics."
10820437,"Project Summary
Lentiviruses including HIV-1 infect both activated/dividing CD4+ T cells and terminally-
differentiated/nondividing myeloid cells (e.g., macrophages and microglia) during the course of their
pathogenesis. The reverse transcription of lentiviruses consumes dNTP substrates provided from the infected
host cells. However, it was predicted that nondividing cells such as macrophages should contain limited dNTP
pools. Indeed, we previously reported that human primary monocyte derived macrophages harbor extremely
limited dNTP levels (20-40 nM), compared to activated CD4+ T cells (1-5 µM), and this limited dNTP level in
macrophages restricts HIV-1 replication. We also reported that the host SAM domain and HD domain
containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), which hydrolyzes dNTPs and is abundant in macrophages, is responsible for
the low dNTP levels and the restricted HIV-1 replication in macrophages. Recently, we discovered two novel
regulatory circuits of SAMHD1 mediated dNTP metabolism that can operate in nondividing myeloid cells
for dNTP depletion and HIV-1 restriction. In this proposal, we propose to elucidate virological, molecular and
structural natures of these regulatory circuits of SAMHD1-mediated dNTP depletion in nondividing myeloid
cells. In Aim 1, we will explore our hypothesis that SAMHD1 not only hydrolyzes dNTPs but also directly
suppresses the RNR-mediated dNTP biosynthesis by binding to RNR in macrophages. Our hypothesis
predicts that Vpx can rapidly elevate dNTP levels in macrophages following SAMHD1 degradation by
simultaneously removing a suppressive regulator of RNR mediated dNTP biosynthesis. Indeed, we recently
observed the direct binding of SAMHD1 to RNR R1 subunit, supporting this hypothesis. Here, we will
investigate this negative dNTP metabolic regulatory circuit mediated by the SAMHD1-RNR interaction for
dNTP depletion and HIV-1 restriction in nondividing myeloid cells. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that cellular PP2A-
B55 phosphatase is a key positive regulator of SAMHD1 in nondividing myeloid cells that can keep SAMHD1
un-phosphorylated and enzymatically active for dNTP depletion and HIV-1 restriction. Indeed, we observed the
interaction of SAMHD1 with B55 regulatory subunit of PP2A in nondividing myeloid cells, supporting this
hypothesis. Here, we will investigate the roles of SAMHD1-PP2A interaction in the negative regulation of dNTP
metabolism and HIV-1 restriction in macrophages. In Aim 3, we propose to investigate the structural and
molecular natures of the SAMHD1 interactions with RNR and PP2A that contribute to dNTP depletion and HIV-
1 restriction in nondividing myeloid cells by employing cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. Overall, we will
explore the unique SAMHD1-mediated dNTP metabolic regulatory circuits in nondividing myeloid cells, which
are engineered by two distinct regulators, and this proposal aims to discover new and better antiviral concepts
specifically targeting HIV-1 in long-living myeloid reservoirs that contribute to HIV-1 persistence."
10774281,"Abstract: Wnt7a-mediated competence to resist osteoarthritis progression
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating disease that currently has no effective therapy. OA has
many risk factors, such as joint injury and aging. However, many people with these risk factors do not develop
OA or develop it to a lesser extent. Individual responses to the same treatment are often also highly variable,
hampering the testing of therapy in a reasonable-sized population. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand
the basis for the diverse manifestations of OA. One driving factor of OA is proposed to be local inflammation.
As prolonged inflammation elicits catabolic changes in the joint, the ability of each individual to resist
inflammation could be directly linked to the trajectory of disease progression. Identifying factors that provide
the competence to resist inflammation may be key to elucidating the cause of OA progression in individuals.
Our long-term goal is to investigate OA pathogenesis to improve its treatment. The goal of this grant is to
investigate the competence to resist inflammation and joint destruction conferred by an underexplored
molecule (Wnt7a) from the Wnt signaling family. This proposal is based on our study that showed a striking
negative-exponential relationship between Wnt7a and catabolic genes in individual human cartilage
specimens. When Wnt7a expression was below a certain threshold, the samples were almost always of OA
background, as if low levels of Wnt7a signify a higher risk of OA. In this way, Wnt7a may be a key factor
associated with OA variability. Ectopic expression of Wnt7a under normal conditions did not impact cartilage
matrix levels, but strongly halted joint destruction in experimental OA, suggesting that Wnt7a provided the joint
with a certain ability to resist OA. Thus, we hypothesize that the level of Wnt7a within articular cartilage
determines the competence against inflammation and impacts the trajectory of OA in each individual,
forming the basis for OA variability. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims by 1) investigating
whether Wnt7a alters the course of inflammation and the trajectory of cartilage loss and joint destruction in OA
and 2) identifying downstream pathways and upstream regulators of Wnt7a. We will use gain- and loss-of
function approaches on mouse OA and human cartilage specimens. The novelty of this study lies in the
concept of Wnt7a as a competence factor for OA resistance in individuals to explore the mechanism of
heterogeneity in OA, and in the use of advanced imaging technologies to test these concepts. These studies
will define the role of Wnt7a in curtailing prolonged inflammation and the propensity for degenerative changes
in OA. Furthermore, it will identify fundamental mechanisms for enhancing or preserving endogenous Wnt7a
function in cartilage for joint protection. Thus, this work will provide important mechanistic insights into OA
progression and its variability and the design of strategies to treat this disease."
10896131,"The Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) include
engineering, technology and applications of science as an important part of students’ learning how science is
utilized. However, very few K-12 life science curriculum materials address this important component. As a
result, students are not introduced to the full range of biomedical workforce careers, leading to missed
opportunities to spark their interest in bioscience and health-related occupations.
 To address this need, the Genetic Science Learning Center (GSLC) at the University of Utah will utilize the
experience it has gained over the past 8 years in developing NGSS-aligned curricula to produce, test and
disseminate two innovative curriculum supplement modules that focus on new and emerging technologies that
are not yet included in biology textbooks. The biomedical engineering module for middle school (grades 7-8)
will focus on computational thinking and engineering design applications that connect to the organ and sensory
system units taught at that level. The genetic technologies module for high school (grades 9-10) will focus on
ways that new and emerging technologies can be used together to diagnose and treat complex human health
conditions. The goals for the Engineering Solutions for Better Health: Genetic Technology and Biomedical
Engineering for Secondary Science project are to:
 GOAL 1: Promote biomedical workforce development by engaging secondary-level students with
engineering and technology applications in healthcare via new curriculum replacement modules so
they can make informed choices related to careers. Approach: Involve teachers at schools with a majority
of students who are underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR) in drafting each module, testing activities
with their students, and refining it. Produce curriculum-embedded videos of UBR students interacting with UBR
individuals in the biomedical workplace who are developing or using the featured technologies. Conduct a RCT
with UBR students to evaluate each module’s efficacy for student learning and increased career interest.
 GOAL 2: Support biomedical workforce development through professional development courses
and workshops that educate teachers about genetic technologies and biomedical engineering and
prepare them to implement the curriculum supplement modules with their students. Approach: Offer 4
online courses, recruiting at least 120 teachers from across the US, focusing those at schools with a majority of
UBR students. Present at least 5 workshops at state, regional and national science teacher conferences.
 The project will take advantage of the GSLC’s award-winning expertise in developing effective, interactive,
multimedia learning experiences; its published methods for involving teachers in curriculum development; and
its extensive experience in teacher professional development. The modules will be broadly disseminated via
our Learn.Genetics and Teach.Genetics websites, which are used annually by >16 million visitors worldwide."
10842349,"Project Summary
 Progressive lung fibrosis is a feature of systemic diseases and chronic injury but can also occur in the
absence of any known etiology as with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a devastating disorder with a
median survival of ~4 years from time of diagnosis and current medical therapy only modestly slows disease
progression. Even fibrosis from known causes can lead to a difficult progressive course, thsu it is vital that the
pathogenesis of fibrosis is more precisely elucidated in order to identify novel therapeutic targets.
 Recent studies from both human fibrotic diseases and animal models have identified a critical role for type II
alveolar epithelial cell (AEC2) injury and apoptosis in the initiation of interstitial scarring. However, the
downstream pathways that translate AEC2 injury/death into fibrosis remain undefined. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that an array of AEC2 insults drives their expression of CCL2/CCL12, chemokines involved in
pro-fibrotic monocyte/macrophage recruitment. The importance of this response was confirmed by
demonstrating that mice deficient in AEC2-derived CCL12 developed attenuated fibrosis in a murine model.
 AEC2 injury can also progress to apoptosis with an accompanying oxidation of their abundant phospholipid
stores, and we discovered that uptake and accumulation of oxidized phospholipid (oxPL) derived from
apoptotic AEC2s (either released or retained within apoptotic bodies) induces a pro-fibrotic phenotypic switch
in the ingesting lung macrophage. Administration of apoptotic AEC2s or oxPL into the lungs of uninjured mice
is sufficient to drive lung fibrosis and this uptake is mediated by CD36. The accumulation of oxPL within
macrophages is also determined by its catabolism which we have shown is regulated primarily by lysosomal
phospholipase A2 (LPLA2). Our preliminary results indicate that the rapid intracellular degradation of oxPL by
LPLA2 in alveolar macrophages can minimize macrophage activation. Compared to resident macrophages,
monocyte-derived macrophages that are recruited to the injured lung exhibit a greater pro-fibrotic response to
oxPL accumulation due to their decreases expression of LPLA2.
 These preliminary data motivate our central hypothesis that AEC2 injury/apoptosis results in a coordinated
response in which the elaboration of CCL12 from injured AECs attracts monocyte-derived macrophages to the
alveolar space where they engulf and accumulate oxPL resulting in robust pro-fibrotic activation. We will
pursue a multifaceted approach using in vitro studies of primary murine and human macrophages with in vivo
mouse experiments using novel transgenic mice, bone marrow transplant chimeras, and complementary
models of lung fibrosis. We have formed a synergistic team with expertise in lipids, monocyte/macrophages,
and AEC2s. Our research project specifically addresses a recognized knowledge gap in fibrosis pathogenesis.
Importantly, the results of these studies will define previously unexplored mechanisms that critically regulate
fibrosis and will inform the development of novel therapies."

Project Scientist is being established to, ""understand the physiology of the weight reduced state
and the mechanisms of individual variability in weight maintenance.” In their applications, the
Clinical Centers will have proposed a behavioral/lifestyle weight loss intervention for adults with
overweight and/or obesity and a design for a weight maintenance phase of at least 12 months
during which participants who achieve successful weight loss will be followed longitudinally. To
accomplish the consortium`s overarching scientific objective, a (presumably) common clinical
trial of a behavioral/lifestyle intervention will be designed and implemented and participants who
meet a to-be-determined definition of successful weight loss will be followed prospectively for at
least 12 months to evaluate weight loss maintenance. During both phases, data and
biospecimens will be collected “to determine the extent, duration, and potential behavioral,
metabolic, cellular and molecular mechanisms for” maintaining a reduced weight (i.e., factors
affecting regulation of both energy intake and metabolic adaptation/regulation of energy
expenditure). There will be common outcomes, assessments, and biospecimens but there could
also be site-specific, particularly highly mechanistic, measures. Ancillary studies will be
encouraged to “leverage collected data and biospecimens, as well as the recruited cohort to
expand the scientific output of the group.”
Our DCC will support study design, study implementation, monitoring, data analysis. We include
experts in weight loss and maintenance intervention, weight regain assessment, omics, and
statistics who will collaborate with experts at the clinical centers. We will develop a secure
distributed data entry system and maintain a secure central database of clinical, laboratory, and
other information. To facilitate the ancillary study process, we will maintain the biospecimen
inventory. The DCC will develop safety and efficacy analysis plans. We will prepare materials
for the single Institutional Review Board (sIRB), presentations for the Steering Committee, Data
and Safety Monitoring Board, and scientific conferences, for publications and for other purposes
as approved by the Steering Committee. We will provide logistical support and coordinate
consortium activities, including meetings and conference calls, ancillary study and publications
and presentations processes. We will archive documentation and all data, intervention
materials, and coordinate archiving all specimens at the end of the study. Dr. Belle's and King's
extensive expertise in conducting, analyzing, and evaluating results of multi-center clinical trials

Obesity has been steadily increasing in prevalence and now affects more than 4 in 10 U.S. adults, leading to
many adverse health outcomes including myocardial infarction, stroke, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension,
sleep apnea, arthritis, and others. Effective surgical, pharmaceutical, and behavioral treatments for obesity are
available, and the evidence to support the broad use of these treatments for obesity is very well established.
However, active management of obesity defined as prescribing or referring adults with obesity for lifestyle,
pharmaceutical, or surgical treatment of obesity, is greatly underused. Major underlying reasons for
underutilization of effective obesity treatments include: (a) both patients and primary care clinicians (PCCs)
frequently underestimate the effectiveness and potential benefits of obesity treatments; and (b) both patients
and clinicians typically lack access to evidence-based, patient-specific estimates of the potential benefits and
risks of appropriate patient-specific obesity treatment options.
To address this problem, we integrate externally validated prediction equations that estimate benefits and risk
of various obesity treatment options in adults with T2DM into a widely-used and successful clinical decision
support system in order to deliver appropriate patient-specific obesity treatment suggestions at the point of
care. We implement a scalable, web-based point-of-care decision-support intervention in a randomized trial in
40 primary care clinics with 15,814 eligible patients, and assess intervention impact on the following primary
outcomes: (a) appropriate referral of eligible patients for evaluation for metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS); (b)
appropriate initiation of FDA-approved medications for weight loss; (c) weight trajectories; and (d) patient-
reported conversations with their PCC about weight loss and intentions to engage in weight loss. In addition,
we collect and analyze clinician-reported and patient-reported data to identify factors that may impede or
facilitate broad dissemination of this intervention strategy to other care delivery settings.
This innovative project will (a) provide state-of-the-art scientific evidence on obesity treatment to large numbers
of obese American adults with T2DM and their PCCs at the point of care; (b) help PCCs identify appropriate
patient-specific obesity treatment options; (c) implement in primary care a web-based EHR-linked obesity
treatment clinical decision support model that uses state-of-the-art HIT standards, is broadly scalable, easy to
update as evidence changes, and optimized for clear communication of information to patients and PCCs; and
(d) improve the clinical return on ongoing massive private and public investments in outpatient health
information systems."
10881690,"Numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that circulating levels of testosterone
decline with age in men. Likewise, human aging also results in a gradual decline in ovarian steroid production,
a dramatic decline in adrenal androgens (DHEA, DHEAS), and alterations in cortisol and aldosterone
production and secretion. Similar to humans, aging in experimental rodents is also associated with profound
changes in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones, particularly testosterone. For the past 33 years or
so (with almost continuous support through Merit Review funding), my laboratory has been actively involved in
delineating cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the age-related decline in steroid hormone
biosynthesis and secretion, with a particular emphasis on testosterone. Our work during the past several years
has established a causal link between increased reactive oxygen species formation/excessive oxidative stress
and oxidative damage to the cellular machinery involved in cholesterol transport to mitochondria resulting in
attenuated cholesterol transport with consequent impairment of steroidogenesis during aging. Currently, we
are investigating the impact of aging-induced excessive oxidative damage to cytosolic and mitochondrial
superoxide dismutase-peroxiredoxin (SOD-PRDX) antioxidant axes on the functional expression of crucial
proteins involved in cholesterol transport (SNAREs) to and within the mitochondria (StAR) for the production of
steroid precursor, pregnenolone. Over the years, a second major research effort of my laboratory has been
and continues to be to understand how cholesterol from lipoproteins, particularly, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), is transported, processed intracellularly, and metabolized by steroidogenic tissues and cells. We are
also studying how this process affects steroid hormone synthesis, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and
atherosclerosis. Our work on HDL metabolism (funded by NIH since 1984), have led to the demonstration that
the cellular delivery of HDL-cholesteryl esters (CE) into steroidogenic cells does not involve the endocytic
pathway as typified by the LDL (B/E) receptor pathway. Rather, CE is taken into the cell via a `selective'
pathway in a process that did not require the internalization of the entire lipoprotein particle. This selective
pathway has been extensively characterized by us and it is especially important in liver and steroidogenic
tissues where it delivers CE in bulk for product formation (steroid and bile acids) and biliary cholesterol
secretion as a part of RCT. Scavenger receptor, class B type 1 (SR-B1) is an HDL receptor that mediates
selective delivery of HDL-CEs in steroidogenic and hepatic tissues and is also implicated in the
pathophysiology of RCT and atherosclerosis. At present, we are investigating the transcriptional and
posttranscriptional regulation of SR-B1 and its relevance to steroidogenesis, RCT, and atherosclerosis.
Currently, we are working on two additional projects. One project is focused on defining the lipid lowering and
anti-hyperglycemic actions of creosote bush-derived nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Previous work from
our laboratory has shown that NDGA, has profound effects on the core components of the metabolic syndrome
(MetS) including lowering of blood glucose, free fatty acids, and triglyceride (TG) levels in several models of
dyslipidemia, as well as improving body weight (obesity), insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, and
ameliorating hepatic steatosis. The current focus of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanism by
which NDGA exerts its hypolipidemic actions in the major insulin-sensitive tissues, liver, skeletal muscle, and
adipose tissue, and improves dyslipidemia, insulin sensitivity and hepatic steatosis. In another project, efficacy
of several dual function apoA-I mimetic peptides (Artery Therapeutics, Inc.) engineered to mimic anti-
atherosclerotic and anti-diabetic functionalities, is being evaluated using several mouse models
atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity."
10846761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the success of standard antiretroviral therapy (ART), the need for an HIV cure remains compelling, both
to improve the lives of PWH and to bring about the end of the pandemic. Strategies for an HIV cure fall under
two categories: those that seek ART-free ‘remission’, and those targeting a classical cure or ‘eradication’. While
precedents exist for both scenarios, the latter have only been achieved with bone marrow transplantation. In
contrast, although naturally occurring immune-mediated control of HIV (remission) is relatively rare, many such
cases have been described. Our proposed “Martin Delaney Collaboratory for HIV Cure Research” program is
entitled “REACH” - Research Enterprise to Advance a Cure for HIV. The central theme of REACH is that cellular
immune responses (NK and T-cells), combined with next generation virus-neutralizing biologics, can be
harnessed to achieve durable remission and eradication of HIV reservoirs. The proposed research focuses on
closing gaps in our understanding of the fundamentals of the system that we are trying to perturb, i.e.: the HIV
reservoir in relation to cellular immunity, as the means to achieve real progress towards effective and viable HIV
cure strategies. Our approach centers around three research foci, which emphasize back to basics science, but
connect this with discovery to translational pipelines directed towards both remission and eradication. The
proposed objectives, broadly defined, aim to: (1) redefine the three-way relationship between the persistent HIV
reservoir, CD8+ T-cells, and rebound virus at the levels of: single cells, individuals, and diverse populations, (2)
harness conventional and unconventional (bNAb-induced) CD8+ T-cells responses, in combination with bNAbs
and ‘next generation’ biologics, to achieve durable control of HIV replication, and (3) develop a discovery-to-
translation pipeline to overcome multiple barriers to the eradication of HIV reservoirs by CTL/NK cells. These
studies will be rooted in a strong basic science program that will contextualize results with novel insights into
barriers to immune-mediated reservoir elimination, including the role of the proviral integration site and of viral and
host factors influencing immune susceptibility. Our program prioritizes the study of diverse populations, including
African populations infected with non-B subtype virus, and women – both to advance towards a cure for all, and
to benefit from diverse perspectives as a source of fundamental insights. These objectives will be realized by a
group of accomplished investigators of diverse expertise and with strong collaborative histories, along with
community and industry partners."

Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of the periodontium and is the
leading cause of tooth loss in adults. It is driven by a dysbiotic microbial biofilm that colonizes the gingival sulcus.
We seek to identify and characterize the local immune response to the microbial biofilm that leads to periodontitis.
Recently, CD69 engagement on T regulatory cells was reported to induce immunosuppressive activities. A
natural ligand for CD69-mediated activation of Tregs is calprotectin (CLP; S100A8 complexed to S100A9;
S100A8/A9; MRP8/14). When expressed in stratified squamous epithelia, this divalent cation-binding complex
appears to contribute to intraepithelial antimicrobial defense. When released from infected or desquamating
keratinocytes or neutrophils, however, CLP may interact with CD69+ T regulatory or T helper 17 cells, ultimately
suppressing the immune response. If so, CLP may function during the initiation of
periodontitis contrary to its postulated function as a proinflammatory “alarmin”. Using a global CLP null mouse,
our preliminary data suggest that the net effect of CLP dampens the recruitment of an acute inflammatory infiltrate
and limits periodontal bone destruction in a ligature-induced experimental periodontitis model. We will now
explore a modified mouse model of ligature-induced periodontitis primed with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg).
and in the resolution phase
We hypothesize that CLP signals through CD69 during the initiation
and resolution phases
of experimental
periodontal inflammation to dampen the destructive cellular infiltrate in the gingiva. To test our hypothesis, we
will: 1: Characterize the differences in the inflammatory cell infiltrate attributable to CLP during the initial
and resolution phases
 of experimental periodontitis. 2: Determine how Pg-primed Treg cells modulate
the recruitment of the initial inflammatory cell infiltrates through CD69 signaling
and CLP. 3: Determine the contribution of Pg-primed Th17 cells to modulating recruitment of the initial
and resolution phase
and resolution phase
inflammatory cell infiltrates attributable to CD69 signaling and CLP. To our
knowledge, we are the first group with data suggesting that CLP dampens the innate immune response in a
CD69-dependent manner. We have the tools to explain how CLP contributes to recruitment of innate immune
cells by affecting Treg and Th17 cells in vivo using a murine model of periodontitis. Ultimately, we will
characterize how CLP and CD69 signaling in Treg and Th17 cells shapes the immune cell environment in the
gingiva to drives either protection of periodontal tissues or destruction of alveolar bone. The results obtained
here will be used to design therapeutic interventions directed at boosting or inhibiting the activity of CLP. Critical
steps will be identified that might be amenable to targeted therapeutic intervention in humans. Ultimately we
aim to reduce the economic and personal burden of periodontal diseases."

Overall: Abstract
Since its original description by Hans Chiari in the 1890s, Chiari type I malformation (CM) has been defined as
caudal displacement (ectopia) of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum. This definition oversimplifies
the complex range of craniovertebral junction pathology affecting more than 1% of the population and has little
relevance to the neurological effects of CM. However, current clinical practice continues to rely heavily on this
oversimplified and outdated definition of CM, with most management decisions based on a single, static 2D
sagittal MRI image, failing to consider the dynamic pathophysiology at the interface of the cerebellum, brainstem,
and spinal cord. Investigations from our group and others implicate a hyperdynamic pathophysiological state in
CM, with turbulent CSF flow patterns, exaggerated pulsatile motion of the tonsils and brainstem, and dysfunction
or injury to the cerebellum, brainstem, or spinal cord. The relationship of these changes at the CVJ to patient
experience (pain and/or neurological deficits), cognitive or behavioral outcome, and CM-associated
syringomyelia (SM, spinal cord cavitation), remains unclear and under-investigated.
The Park-Reeves Chiari & Syringomyelia Center (PRCSC) at Washington University was established in 2011
and has become the international leader and vibrant focal point for research into CM. The Overarching Theme
of this PRCSC Program Project Proposal is “Redefining Chiari Type I Malformation and its Impact on
Neurological Outcome.” This proposal will leverage key strengths and scientific advances at Washington
University to investigate the largest and most refined cohort of CM patients in the world. Four Cores
[Administrative (AC), Clinical (CC), Genetic (GC), and Radiology (RC) Cores] will support 4 Projects: Genetic
Underpinnings of CM and Effect on Brain Development [Haller, Project Lead (PL); Solnica-Krezel, Co-Lead (CL)];
Functional Connectivity, Brain Development, and Outcomes in CM [Dosenbach, PL; Roland and Marek, CL];
CSF-Mediated Pathophysiology and Microstructural Injury Determines Outcomes in CM [Strahle, PL; Song, CL];
and Redefining CM Using Genotype-Phenotype Relationships and Impact on Outcome [Limbrick, PL; Greenberg
and Lu, CL]. Although these Cores and Projects each address unique Specific Aims, they will generate a wealth
of multidimensional data from PRCSC participants to permit a cohesive, synergistic, and comprehensive
examination of the overarching Aims of this application. Indeed, PRCSC as a whole is much greater than the
sum of its Cores and Projects.
 Overall Specific Aim 1. Determine the genetic factors contributing to CM, brain development, and
 neurological function.
 Overall Specific Aim 2. Determine the pathophysiological basis for CM-related neurological effects.
 Overall Specific Aim 3: Create a novel CM framework to enhance treatment response and outcomes."
10840002,"Rates of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality are disproportionately high and increasing among racial/ethnic
minorities and women and in rural areas. Almost 90,000 Americans die annually from alcohol use. Despite the
health consequences, fewer than 10% of those with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive evidence-based
treatment, and racial/ethnic minorities and women are less likely to access treatment. Barriers to treatment
include stigma, treatment setting appeal, and health insurance benefit design. Medicaid programs are among
the most important payers for AUD treatment and rates of AUD in the Medicaid population are especially high.
Medicaid provides health insurance for more than 77 million Americans, including a large and disproportionate
share of racial/ethnic minorities, women, and rural Americans. Almost all state Medicaid programs contract with
Medicaid managed care organizations (MMCOs) to deliver and manage health care services and nearly 70%
of Medicaid enrollees are now in managed care. MMCOs must adhere to state requirements and policies, but
have considerable discretion over polices that may influence access, treatment appeal, and cost. However,
there is almost no information or transparency on MMCO polices related to alcohol treatment services. This
study systematically examines AUD treatment policies in MMCOs, an under-explored level where important
decisions are made that influence access and outcomes. We will conduct a national survey of MMCOs and link
their responses to patient-level Medicaid data. The specific aims are: 1) Examine Medicaid MMCO alcohol
treatment policies (e.g. coverage, utilization management, provider networks, innovations) across MMCOs that
contract with the 50 states and District of Columbia; determine whether there are differences in MMCO alcohol
treatment policies by state Medicaid policies. 2) Assess the relationship between MMCO policies and access to
AUD treatment (e.g. initiation and engagement in treatment, follow-up after hospitalization) by race/ethnicity,
gender, and rural/urban geography. 3) Assess the relationship between MMCO policies and alcohol treatment
outcomes (i.e.. treatment retention, pharmacotherapy duration, hospitalization, ED visit) by race/ethnicity,
gender and rural/urban geography. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely qualified with experience conducting
four previous commercial health plan behavioral health studies, and conducting rigorous disparities and
Medicaid analyses. Findings will provide valuable information on MMCO policies and their associations with
access, treatment appeal and cost for racial/ethnic minorities and other Americans. This information can be
used by plan administrators as they develop and implement policies, state Medicaid directors as they contract
with and regulate MMCOs, and federal policy makers making determinations about Medicaid waivers and other
efforts to improve access to alcohol treatment in the US."

The increasing rates of suicide among adolescents is an urgent public health concern. In parallel, emergency
department (ED) visits and psychiatric hospitalizations due to youth suicide risk have also been on the rise.
Although psychiatric hospitalization provides critical stabilization, discharged adolescents remain at elevated
risk for recurrent suicidal crises (e.g., suicide attempts, rehospitalizations). New approaches are urgently
needed to alter risk trajectories and prevent suicidal behavior among adolescents transitioning from inpatient
care. Bridging an adaptive intervention (AI) strategy—wherein type, intensity, and timing of treatment can be
individualized to address suicidal adolescents’ changing and heterogenous treatment needs—together with
mobile technology to reach adolescents during the high-risk post-discharge period, our goal is to identify an
optimal AI for reducing youth suicidal behavior after inpatient care. We build on promising evidence from our
recently completed NIMH-funded pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) of a multi-
component intervention comprised of: a Motivational Interview (MI)-enhanced safety plan delivered to
adolescents and parents during hospitalization (MI-SP); post-discharge booster calls provided to youth and
parents; and text-based support (Texts) delivered to adolescents daily for a month after discharge. In addition
to feasibility and acceptability, the pilot SMART results suggested that certain intervention sequences improved
key mechanisms of change (self-efficacy, safety plan use, coping) and were, preliminarily, associated with
lower suicidal behavior 3 months after discharge. In this application, we propose to conduct a full-scale
SMART to address the following specific aims: (1) Compare the AIs that begin with MI-SP alone or MI-SP plus
Texts on the primary outcome of suicidal behavior (actual, interrupted, or aborted attempts) within 3 months
post discharge and the two secondary outcomes of time-to-suicidal behavior and severity of suicidal ideation
over 6 months; and (2) Determine the optimal sequence of intervention components by comparing four AIs
embedded in the SMART on primary and secondary outcomes. Adolescents (N=300), ages 13-17, hospitalized
due to suicidal ideation and/or attempt will be initially randomized to MI-SP alone or MI-SP with Texts. Based
on adolescents’ responses to daily surveys, those classified as non-responders within 2 weeks post discharge
will be re-randomized to added low-intensity booster calls (one call with adolescent and one call with parent) or
high-intensity boosters (six calls with each). Secondary aims are to: (1) Identify moderators of initial
intervention options and of augmentation strategies for non-responders; and (2) Examine whether mechanisms
of change (self-efficacy, safety plan use, coping) mediate the impact of MI-SP plus Texts and that of high-
intensity boosters. The proposed research will have significant public health impact by testing different
sequences of continuity of care strategies within an innovative SMART design to identify an optimal
technology-augmented AI targeting suicidal behavior reduction among youth transitioning from inpatient care."
10862549,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is growing need to understand mechanisms and treatment options associated with vascular contributions
to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other forms of dementia and cognitive dysfunction. Early brain changes
associated with AD and other forms of cognitive dysfunction, such as white matter lesion (WML) burden,
hypoperfusion and metabolic mismatch have vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, aging and smoking).
Such structural and functional brain changes are often considered secondary to intracranial cerebral small vessel
disease. In contrast, our preliminary data indicate that extra-cranial carotid artery disease (ECAD) contributes
to brain pathology and its treatment with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) (to surgically remove the plaque)
decreases accumulation of WMLs and neurofibrillary tangles, increases structural connectivity, and most
importantly, improves cognition.
ECAD primarily signifies atherosclerosis of the carotid bifurcation, where plaque accumulation is uniquely
prevalent compared to other cerebrovascular locations. Carotid arteries play a major role in brain physiology
because they bring the majority of blood and nutrients to the brain. We hypothesize that mechanisms of ECAD
contribution to Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive dysfunction are likely multifactorial and include embolic
phenomena, decreased blood flow, and endothelial activation/inflammation. Interplay between these modifiable
factors and non-modifiable risks (ie, age, sex and ApoE status) likely contribute to neurodegeneration that can
lead to cognitive dysfunction. Our Aims 1 and 2 use cross-sectional studies to evaluate potential mechanisms of
ECAD contribution to AD-related brain structure and function changes. Subject evaluation includes
neurocognitive testing and quantification of MRI-defined structural parameters, WML accumulation, Alzheimer’s
disease blood-based biomarkers, and systemic, cerebral and carotid markers of inflammation. Aim 3 employs a
prospective, controlled cohort study evaluating the treatment of ECAD with CEA to determine which patients
show improved cognitive function (responders) and what factors are drivers of this response.
This project will define quantifiable measures of brain structural changes leading to neurodegeneration and
cognitive dysfunction in subjects with ECAD. This should further build the impetus for clinical trials that change
management of patients with ECAD. In addition, our study offers the exciting opportunity to reveal novel insights
of early Alzheimer’s disease risk and specific mechanisms of vascular contributions. Understanding the unique
contribution of ECAD to AD/cognitive dysfunction risk is particularly compelling because effective
treatments exist for ECAD yet are not currently offered for the treatment/prevention of cognitive
dysfunction."
10851802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with
no current therapies that significantly alter disease progression. Cigarette smoke (CS) is a major causative factor
in COPD that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Alveolar epithelial type 2
cells (AEC2s) are essential progenitor cells for normal lung homeostasis (cell renewal) and epithelial repair after
CS injury and in COPD. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest, have been
implicated in COPD and may reduce AEC2 cell progenitor function and epithelial repair. The causative
mechanisms and functional consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction on AEC2 senescence and
epithelial repair in COPD remain major knowledge gaps and may provide new insights for the
development of therapeutic approaches. The major goal of this proposal is to determine how mitochondrial
dysfunction mediated by adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) contributes to cellular senescence and
abnormal epithelial cell repair in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adenine nucleotide translocase
2 (ANT2) is a mitochondrial ATP transporter critical for cell metabolism and fate. We have shown that ANT2
gene expression is reduced in lung tissue from patients with COPD and that ANT2 knockdown in human
bronchial epithelial cells results in reduced mitochondrial respiration (Kliment et al, J Cell Sci 2021). Our
preliminary data show that human ANT2 is specifically reduced in AEC2s from COPD lungs. Knockdown of
ANT2 in epithelial cells in vitro results in increased p21 and p16 (markers of senescence). In a mouse CS model
of COPD, loss of ANT2 in alveolar epithelial cells results in enhanced lung destruction (emphysema), increased
p21 and p16 in AEC2s, and increased ROS. This proposal will determine how ANT2 protects against
emphysema by modulating ROS production, mitochondrial metabolism and senescence in AEC2 cells
and epithelial repair after CS. Our study will determine the following: 1) To test the hypothesis that loss of
ANT2 in AEC2 cells drives senescence by increasing ROS and the DNA damage response (DDR). 2) To test
the hypothesis that loss of ANT2 shifts AEC2 metabolism and decreases repair capacity to promote COPD. 3)
To test the hypothesis that therapeutic restoration of ANT2 or removal of senescent cells can protect against
emphysema. The outcome of this proposal will define the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction and
shifts towards glycolytic metabolism due to loss of ANT2 drives senescence and dysregulated epithelial repair
in AEC2 cells in COPD. Elucidation of ANT2 as a major regulator of lung epithelial repair and senescence through
mitochondrial dysfunction provides critical knowledge connecting these processes and will inform the discovery
of new COPD therapies."
10824370,"ABSTRACT
Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) recommendations, and minorities are less
likely to meet these recommendations than non-Hispanic Whites. Physical inactivity and obesity are major risk
factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to
preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an
important impact on PA, yet social contexts remain understudied in intervention research. The goal of the
proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-month behavioral dyadic intervention to promote
positive and sustained change in PA among inactive predominantly Latina and African American women in
Houston, TX. Dyads will first be randomly assigned to the dyadic intervention or to an individual condition.
Within the individual condition, one woman from each dyad will subsequently be randomized to the individual
intervention and the other woman to a health education control. The dyadic and individual interventions will
consist of telephone-based health coaching, a Fitbit, and health education newsletters to enhance motivation
and behavioral skills for increasing PA. The health coaching for the dyadic intervention additionally focuses on
building participants' capacity to be a supportive partner by training dyads in positive communication strategies
and offering support in a non-judgmental and empathetic way. The health education control will consist of a
Fitbit and health education newsletters. Study participants will include 500 predominantly Latina and African
American inactive women recruited and enrolled as dyads (e.g., family or friends; n=250 dyads). The
intervention expands upon a pilot randomized trial conducted by the investigative team that showed preliminary
evidence of support and also identified areas for improvement. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6
months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. The primary
outcome is change in minutes per week of moderate-intensity PA. Lower body strength, anthropometric
measures (i.e., BMI, waist circumference), sedentary behavior, mean daily steps, and blood pressure are
secondary outcomes. Autonomous motivation, social support, autonomy support, self-efficacy, and outcome
expectancies will be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA. The proposed research is innovative
in its comparison of a dyadic intervention against an individual intervention and in its emphasis on dyadic social
processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets existing social
networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change that will persist beyond the
intervention period. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding whether and how features of
social contexts can be modified to support healthy lifestyle change as a means of addressing disparities in
cancer and chronic disease risk among predominantly Latina and African American women."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older adults and occurs in all ethnic and racial groups.
Genetic studies of AD have mostly been performed in non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) of Northern European (NE)
ancestry. Only recently have efforts in AD started to expand into other populations, such as African-Americans
(AA) and Hispanics (HI), and have a ready demonstrated differences in both risk effect size (e.g., APOE in AA
and HI) and risk loci (e.g., ABCA7 in AA). Further evaluation demonstrates that genetic ancestry (as opposed to
environmental/cultural factors) likely underlie at least part of this heterogeneity. Individuals with the Amerindian
(AI) ancestry remain one of the most underrepresented groups in AD. Importantly, the NHW datasets did not
differentiate among the Europeans (EU), whereas recent investigations showed that these pan-European results
only partially overlap with the findings from populations from the Iberian Peninsula (IP) with Southern European
(SE) ancestry. Caribbean and South American Hispanic populations are admixed with both AI and SE, thus
making their study a critical scientific objective. Our proposed study enables testing the generalization of findings
from NHW to these other ancestries, as well as identify AD risk/protective factors correlated specifically with AI
and SE ancestry. Our results will allow for a better and more complete understanding of the genetic architecture
of AD which will help improve disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in AI, admixed Hispanic
populations, and beyond. To accomplish these goals, we propose three aims. In Aim 1 we will characterize
known AD loci in admixed populations with AI and SE ancestry. This includes expanding collections, generalizing
known AD loci to AI/SE populations, and variant discovery through admixture mapping and fine-mapping. In Aim
2 we will extend our Puerto Rican dataset by expanding PR multiplex families. This will allow more powerful
linkage analyses, longitudinal neurocognitive and biomarker data, and the initiation of a brain donation program.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform functional follow-up of variants using bioinformatics approaches, assessment of
AD biomarkers, and assessment of cellular function using IPSc."
10828834,"Spermatogenesis is a carefully orchestrated process in which spermatogonial stem cells differentiate into
spermatids and eventually motile sperm. This process requires a series of changes in epigenetic changes,
chromatin reorganization, dynamic changes in mRNA 3’UTR length, and temporally regulated patterns of
translation. Emerging evidence suggests that precise stage-specific alterations in the epitranscriptome are
also required for proper spermatogenesis. For example, spermatocyte-specific depletion of “readers,”
“writers,” or “erasers,” of N6-methyladenosine, a modified nucleotide that impacts long noncoding RNA
(lncRNA) function and mRNA stability, translation, and splicing, are all associated with stage-specific arrests in
spermatogenesis. Additional data suggests that spermatogenesis is also affected by N6, 2’-O-
dimethyladenosine (m6Am), a modified adenosine that is found exclusively at the first transcribed nucleotide
position of certain mRNAs. Based on these studies, it is clear that epitranscriptomic modifications are
required for spermatogenesis. However the mechanisms by which m6A and m6Am regulate spermatogenesis
remain unclear. In order to decipher the role of the epitranscriptome in spermatogenesis, the specific aims of
this project are: (1) To map m6A in a cell-type specific and quantitative manner during spermatogenesis. We
will develop new methods to selectively map m6A in animals, and determine if dynamic changes in m6A control
mRNA 3’UTR length. These methods will reveal the dynamics of m6A levels throughout spermatogenesis and
if m6A function is involved in orchestrating 3’UTR length dynamics that is characteristic of spermatogenesis.
(2) To determine the role of m6A in controlling the epigenome during spermatogenesis. m6A is often enriched in
lncRNAs, and it can affect their ability to induce epigenetic gene silencing. We will identify chromatin-
associated lncRNAs that contain m6A and determine how m6A affects epigenetic dynamics during
spermatogenesis. (3) To determine how YTHDC2 and m6Am regulate spermatogenesis. YTHDC2 is required
for meiotic progression by binding and regulating m6A mRNAs. However, YTHDC2 shows relatively weak
binding to m6A. We find that YTHDC2 shows high-affinity binding to m6Am. We will map m6Am during
spermatogenesis, and determine the function of m6Am by depleting its biosynthetic methyltransferase. We will
also determine if the function of YTHDC2 is to regulate the stability or translation of m6Am mRNAs during
spermatogenesis. Together, these experiments will reveal the cell-type specific dynamics of the
epitranscriptome and will reveal how these epitranscriptomic modifications affect epigenetic states, mRNA
stability, mRNA 3’UTR processing and mRNA translation during spermatogenesis."
10825528,"ABSTRACT
The complexity of cell-cell interactions in the tumor represents one of the biggest barriers to understanding
cancer and to developing effective therapeutics. Cancer cells constantly interact with fibroblast cells, endothelial
cells, immune cells, signaling molecules and the extracellular matrix in the tumor microenvironment (TME).
The interactions between host and cancer cells are complex, with effects that may be tumor-suppressive or
tumor-promoting. For example, macrophages are first recruited to fight cancer; however, interactions with cancer
cells can render them tumor-supportive. Thus, enabling a greater understanding of the complexities of the
interaction between cancer cells and their microenvironment can lead to a better understanding of mechanisms
of drug resistance, identification of new molecular targets and help address the large unmet needs in treating
cancer. Quantitative technologies, such as ours, that integrate ex vivo drug treatments and assess
pharmacological responses with cellular and molecular phenotypes in native tissues, should accelerate the
discovery and development of novel therapeutics.
Yet present tools to study drug responses and the TME have not kept up with drug testing needs. Given the
nearly infinite number of potential combinations and limited resources to actually test them, there is a great need
for testing platforms that use human, intact tumor tissue ex vivo to predict in vivo responses to combination
immunotherapies in miniaturized, multiplexed formats that retain as much of the TME as possible.
In our first R01 cycle, we developed a microfluidic platform (called Oncoslice) that allows for selective
spatiotemporal exposure of organotypic cultures to dozens of drug conditions, and we demonstrated its utility
with cell death assays on xenograft and patient GBM slices. In this second R01 cycle, our goal is to apply our
Oncoslice platform to evaluate combination immunotherapies and their interaction with the TME. The
platform will be applied to two difficult-to-treat solid tumor types – pancreatic cancer (PCa, mouse, and human)
and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, mouse). Our recent finding that intratumoral migration of CD8+ T cells
is a necessary precursor to anti-tumor activity in response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in pancreatic
cancer lends credence to our assertion that developing a micro-scale understanding of cell-cell interactions in
the TME is critical. Both PCa and TNBC are extremely heterogeneous and respond poorly to current immune
checkpoint inhibitors. New developments to our platform will include live imaging of dynamic changes in the
immune TME, tissue and cytokine sampling, selective transcriptomics, and protein pathway profiling. We will
integrate phenotypic responses in slices with molecular data to build predictive statistical models. Together,
these approaches will establish an innovative platform for immuno-modulatory drug discovery designed to
provide insights into the drug's mechanism of action and the TME's role in cancer treatment."

The objective of the Multi-Disciplinary Training Program in the Mechanisms of Cardio-metabolic Disease is to
provide pre-doctoral scholars with balanced, interdisciplinary training for a successful research career in
integrative cardiovascular research related to minority health. The focus of this training will be on mechanisms
of cardiovascular disease in compromised metabolic and endocrine states. An emphasis in this program
is cardio-metabolic disease common in minorities – hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. The specific goals are:
1) To train the next generation basic and translational scientists in cardiovascular pathophysiology, especially in
states of metabolic dysfunction directly relevant to health problems of minorities, through course work and state-
of-the-art research opportunities; 2) To provide pre-doctoral students with the necessary tools for effective
scientific communication, including networking, grant writing, and formal training in responsible conduct of
research (RCR) to build a competent and ethical research careers; and 3) Actively recruit and train minority
candidates in cardio-metabolic disease research, in part, by leveraging our established connections with
historically black colleges through our prior trainees. These goals will be achieved through the highly integrated
research programs within the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) at Augusta University. MCG-AU has
established itself as a leading national center for basic and clinical science research in cardiovascular disease.
Mentors in the Program come from a variety of basic and clinical research units, including the Departments of
Physiology, Pharmacology & Toxicology, and Cell Biology & Anatomy, Medicine and Pediatrics, including
members of Nephrology, Cardiology, Hematology and Anesthesiology sections. Major interdisciplinary research
units, the Vascular Biology Center (basic science) and the Georgia Prevention Institute are also prominent in the
program. The goal of Program Leadership is to provide expert oversight characterized by excellence in research,
commitment to training and leadership experience both internal and external to the institution. A shared
governance model has been adopted that provides a mechanism of consensus leadership to keep the Program
at the high level we expect for training at MCG-AU. Overall leadership is shared between two co-directors, Drs.
David Stepp and Jennifer Sullivan. Internal Advisory and Admission Committees along with an External Advisory
Committee provide an experienced team of leaders for the program. Pre-doctoral (PhD or MD/PhD) will be
selected based on interest in cardiovascular biology, previous academic performance and research experience.
All students will be required to participate in didactic coursework and a comprehensive set of professional skills
courses including responsible conduct of research, effective scientific communication and networking,
knowledge of technology transfer, scientific writing and review of the literature, preparation and presentations at
local, national, and international conferences, grant writing and review, and leadership skills for subsequent
career stages."
10867376,"Fall-related injury in the elderly carries a 20% mortality rate, and is the sixth leading cause
of death in this population. Age-related dysfunction of gravity receptors within the vestibular
system is highly correlated with these elderly falls, and significant age-related degeneration is
associated with nearly all types of vestibular cells. The overarching goal of this study is to analyze
human and mice genome-wide association studies (GWAS), vestibular-specific human and mice
genomic expression, and single-cell sequencing of specific sites in the vestibular system, then
test identified genes and related pathways in the lab. Our objective is to characterize the genomics
related to age-related imbalance for future prevention and treatment. The central hypothesis is
that by this analysis, we can identify anatomic and physiologic sites relevant to the balance system
that is common to both species. Our rationale is that by this analysis, we can better focus on
relevant genes and pathways for lab testing and ultimate therapeutic intervention. Building upon
a small GWAS on elderly falls that correlated human DCC and PTK2 genes in the same pathway
as Dcc identified in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) GWAS, our specific aims will be:
1) a. Perform GWAS in humans based on a dizziness/falls phenotype in a meta-analysis of large
datasets; b. GWAS in mice based on a behavioral and gravity sensor function phenotype in the
HMDP; 2) a. Perform RNA-Sequencing on vestibular tissues from mice and human surgical
specimens; b. Single-cell RNA-Seq on individual tissues; c. Compare identified genes and
pathways via computational methods to assess translation of pathways from the mouse to human
balance system; and 3) Perform functional testing for the top candidates defined in Aim 2 using
knock-out/knock-in mice. Multiple innovations of this project include: 1) the first GWAS of gravity
receptor function in aged mice and in elderly humans, 2) a comprehensive catalogue of genes
and pathways involved in vestibular functional variation with inter-species comparison, as part of
FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) Compliance, 3) in vivo validation in mouse
models and an analysis of these candidates in available human cohorts, and 4) future potential
for targeted therapies. Our outcome is the first comparative GWAS of the balance system
between animal models and humans. The impact of this work will be to lay a firm foundation for
development of targeted treatment of the balance system to diminish falls in the elderly."
10837740,"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes osteoarthritis as a serious disease with an
unmet need for therapies that slow, stop, or reverse joint damage. A challenge to testing new therapies is the
lack of a comprehensive definition of disease progression that incorporates multiple structural changes.
Another challenge is not knowing how much change in a structural measure would reflect meaningful benefit or
worsening to a patient. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has great potential to address these critical gaps.
However, no-one has developed an MR-based composite outcome that reflects multiple structural aspects
(“whole-knee”) of knee osteoarthritis progression and is sensitive to change. This remains a critical
technological obstacle to testing and developing new therapies. We recently tackled these barriers and found
that structural measures of knee osteoarthritis progression can be summarized as: 1) cumulative damage
(quantitative articular cartilage damage throughout a knee; relates to radiographic progression), and 2) disease
activity (quantitative bone marrow lesions and effusion-synovitis volumes; relates to pain progression). The
critical next steps are to demonstrate these outcomes are valid and useful predictive biomarkers of KOA
progression by determining 1) how much change in each measure translates to indicators of clinically
meaningful improvement or worsening and 2) the discriminative performance of each composite measure. We
will accomplish this by assessing annual MR images in 3 nested case-control samples to determine the
magnitude of change in cumulative damage and disease activity that predict changes in patient-reported
outcomes (Aim 2) and walking speed (Aim 3), and knee replacement (Aim 4) across biological factors (e.g.,
sex). To achieve our goal, we will quantify 1- or 2-year change in articular cartilage as well as bone marrow

of change in cumulative damage or disease activity that relates to these outcomes during the same time
period. We will also test how much change in these measures differentiates adults who will receive a knee
replacement. Finally, we will test whether cumulative damage and disease activity will reliably predict changes
in patient-centered outcomes across sex, body mass index, radiographic severity, and duration of observation
period. This study will support an application for approval of these structural endpoints as predictive
biomarkers for KOA progression, which could greatly improve the chance of success for clinical trials testing
disease-modifying therapies for knee osteoarthritis."
10850665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One novel approach to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity comes from the recognition that parental
obesity or diabetes can increase risk of metabolic disease in offspring via non-genetic effects. This perspective
raises the exciting possibility that treatment of parents to improve their metabolism before conception could
interrupt vicious intergenerational cycles of obesity and diabetes, thus improving offspring health.
In the prior funding cycle, we developed evidence for the impact of paternally-focused interventions on the sperm
epigenome and offspring health. We recently demonstrated in humans that paternal obesity is associated with
altered DNA methylation in cord blood of offspring7. Our new data in mice indicate (1) paternal obesity and
hyperglycemia are key determinants of offspring health, (2) improving paternal metabolism - by treatment with
either SGLT2 inhibitors or caloric restriction - can reverse age-associated weight gain, insulin resistance, glucose
intolerance, and fatty liver in F1 offspring, (3) paternal metabolism potently modifies the transcriptome in fetal
and adult offspring, including oxidative and lipid regulatory genes, and (4) paternal metabolism alters the
epigenome in both sperm and offspring tissue. For example, DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) at enhancers
adjacent to differentially expressed genes is reduced in sperm of HFD-fed males, and reciprocally increased in
males treated with SGLT2i or the AMP kinase activator AICAR.
In this revised application, we will utilize this innovative mouse model to identify the mechanisms by which
paternal health and its treatment modulate the paternal germ cell epigenome to improve offspring health, and to
test the hypothesis that the AMPK-Tet2 pathway, a mediator of glucose-mediated epigenetic regulation,
mediates observed differences in sperm 5hmC and offspring metabolic disease. In Aim 1, we will define the
impact of paternal obesity and hyperglycemia, and its reversal, on the germ cell epigenome (5mC/5hmC, small
RNA), and identify key cis-regulating elements. In Aim 2, we will determine the pathogenicity of germ cell
epigenetic changes by evaluating offspring outcomes after in vitro fertilization and sperm-derived ncRNA
injection. Aim 3 will determine whether paternal effects on offspring are mediated via direct effects on the embryo,
or on extraembryonic lineages affecting placental development, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis of
blastocysts at a single-cell level and detailed morphometric analysis of placentae derived from control, HFD, and
HFD+CANA-treated fathers. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that the AMPK-Tet2 pathway, a mediator of glucose-
mediated epigenetic regulation in somatic cells, also mediates glucose-induced changes in the germ cell
epigenome. We will analyze the impact of AMPK activation in vivo on 5hmC in sperm from wild type or Tet2-null
mice and on offspring phenotypes. In summary, identification of causal mechanisms in response to paternal
hyperglycemia and obesity - and its reversal - will provide critical new information to guide development of new
paternally-focused translatable approaches to reduce disease burden in future generations."

Genome-wide association studies have now discovered tens of thousands of noncoding variants associated with
human diseases and traits. It has proven challenging to interpret these associations. A majority of causal variants
lie in the noncoding genome and appear to affect DNA cis-regulatory elements, which control the logic of gene
expression and could point us to new cell types, genes, and pathways for disease. However, we have lacked
the tools needed to systematically characterize how these cis-regulatory variants and elements impact genome
function and phenotype.
Our team at Stanford University has now developed innovative single-cell, CRISPR mapping, and computational
technologies that will enable identifying and functionally characterizing many thousands of elements and variants
directly in the human genome. These tools include single-cell ATAC-seq to identify candidate elements in cells
and tissues; sensitive CRISPR tiling methods to connect thousands of elements and variants to effects on gene
expression and cellular phenotypes; and the ABC and BPNet models to predict how disease variants regulate
gene expression. Together, these technologies suggest a new strategy to systematically connect DNA variants
and elements to function and phenotype.
Here we will apply these new technologies in collaboration with the NHGRI Impact of Genomic Variation on
Function Consortium. We will use four cardiovascular cell types derived from human pluripotent stem cells as
model systems. First, we will leverage single-cell maps of cardiac differentiation and development to select
elements and risk variants for adult and children’s heart diseases likely to control cardiovascular cell function.
Second, we will apply single-cell CRISPR tools to measure the effects of thousands of unbiased elements and
variants on gene expression, and connect prioritized disease variants to target genes, cellular phenotypes, and
tissue phenotypes. Third, we will leverage these experimental datasets to calibrate and refine computational
models to build a variant-element-phenotype catalog across many human cell types and diseases. Fourth, we
will enable future studies by sharing data, protocols, and software, and by conducting systematic evaluations of
CRISPR technologies and computational models to connect variants to phenotypes. Together, these studies will
advance our understanding of how DNA variants and elements impact genome function and demonstrate a novel
strategy to leverage high-throughput genomic tools to understand biological mechanisms of human diseases."

 The DRCR Retina Network is a consortium dedicated to facilitating multicenter clinical studies of
diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal diseases. The Network’s
mission is to conduct high quality, collaborative clinical research that improves vision and quality of life for
people with retinal diseases. The Network operates through a highly collaborative framework comprised of a
Coordinating Center, two Network Chairs, over 100 clinical sites, and other central resource groups such as
image reading centers. This standing infrastructure, along with the substantial clinical and scientific expertise
of its investigators, allows the Network to be highly efficient and effective in the design, implementation, and
reporting of large-scale, ophthalmic clinical studies of major public health priority.
 In the United States, it is estimated that over 20 million people have retinal pathology from DR, AMD,
retinal vein occlusion, and other retinal disease. The US economic burden from retinal disorders totals as much
as $20 billion per year. The Network is uniquely prepared to make impactful contributions to the fight against
vision loss from retinal diseases. Since its inception in 2002, the Network has successfully made numerous
and substantial contributions to the improvement of visual outcomes in diabetic patients. Network studies have
addressed novel therapies, cost effectiveness, patient quality of life, novel methods of retinal imaging and
multiple aspects of visual function with major direct impact on clinical care guidelines and practices worldwide.
The uniqueness of the Network and its efficiencies of scale allow the performance of protocols using money
from the NIH, industry, and foundations. These protocols often involve trials that would not be done by
industry and would not be feasible with solely NIH funding. Such protocols have included comparative
effectiveness studies, trials supportive of new indications for approved drugs, and studies testing new
therapies. The major goals of the Network over the next 5 year period include 1) conducting studies in retinal
disease of high public health importance by completing the 7 ongoing studies and continuing to develop and
implement protocols with scientific rigor and integrity, 2) maintaining a transparent and open collaborative
Network that mentors and encourages diverse clinical reserachers and 3) growing collaborations with external
research groups, foundations and industry. Given its previous accomplishments, robust organization, high
visibility community and strong enthusiasm of its investigators and personnel, the Network is poised for
success in designing and implementing clinical studies over the next five-year period that will substantially and
positively impact our ability to preserve and improve vision in patients with retinal disease in the US and across
the globe."

The goal of the Tumor Cell Biology Training Program (TCB-TP) is to equip the next generation of cancer
biologists and clinician scientists with the tools required to drive innovative biomedical research during their
careers. Despite dramatic improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of certain cancers, an intensified effort
on multiple fronts is required to continue progress toward long-term survival or cure for all cancer types. The
TCB-TP uses two complementary approaches to provide trainees with the knowledge, analytical tools, and
critical thinking skills they need to integrate diverse and rapidly evolving fields of biology and technology, as well
as insights generated by clinical researchers: 1) Training in the mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression,
and the techniques available to study these processes, and 2) Providing opportunities to directly connect insights
from basic tumor biology with the rapid evolution of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. These objectives are
achieved through the participation of trainees and faculty with a wide range of scientific interests and expertise
in both basic and translational research. Trainee mentors are drawn from 25 Ph.D. and M.D. faculty members in
15 different UCLA departments; areas of research include cancer-initiating cells, transcriptional regulation, tumor
micro-environment, metabolism, computational biology and ‘omics analyses, and cell cycle control, as well as
disease-specific investigations, diagnostics, and drug discovery. Eight predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are
typically supported for two-three years while they conduct mentored laboratory-based research projects. The
TCB-TP provides several additional unique training and career development opportunities for its trainees. The
centerpiece of the program is a monthly seminar course that brings together trainees and faculty to critically
discuss research data presented by each trainee, culminating in an annual symposium. Trainees are also
introduced to the multiple paths leading to new cancer diagnostics and therapeutics through the Career
Opportunities Forum in which invited speakers from industry or science publishing join the trainees for weekly
discussions during summer quarter. The New Technologies Seminar series brings invited faculty together with
trainees to discuss cutting edge technologies, with topics chosen by trainees. Trainees connect with leaders in
their field by inviting and hosting external speakers for the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center
(JCCC) seminar series. One-on-one meetings between program leadership and trainees provide feedback on
seminar presentations and Individual Development Plans. Courses on grant writing, ethics, and reproducibility
in research are mandatory for all trainees. The TCB-TP is jointly directed by Dr. Gay M. Crooks and Dr. Owen
N. Witte, academic leaders at UCLA with well-established programs in basic and translational research. Internal
and external advisory committees assist with program evaluation and strategic planning. As the only cancer cell
biology training program at UCLA, the TCB-TP represents an essential and highly-connected node in the network
of cancer research on campus, the UCLA medical center, and Southern Californian biomedical research."

There is a dire need in developing new molecular paradigms for pharmacotherapy to address problems of poor
drug selectivity, causing side effects, drug resistance, and environmental toxicity. Currently, over 85 % of the drugs
in clinical research are discarded due to poor selectivity. Increasing drug selectivity is a major concern of modern
drug development. Photopharmacology increases drug selectivity by using controlled light-activation of drugs at
a given time and location in the body. Recently, a light-driven molecular nanomotor has been developed (García-
López et al., Nature, 548, 7669, 567, 2017), that is capable of disrupting biological membranes, inducing cell
death in eucaryotic cells. This mechanism has potential applications in drug delivery through lipid nanoparticles,
cancer treatment, and combating infectious diseases. Besides chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, mechanical
action of nanomotors on a molecular level could become a fourth modality in the treatment of patients. However,
being still at a developmental stage, a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process is
required to advance this technology towards clinical applications. We will use computer modeling to study the
molecular mechanism of the membrane disruption by the recently developed nanomotor. Based on the gained
insight, we will design and optimize new nanomotors by introducing functional groups to improve molecular prop-
erties. The ﬁnal goal is to develop a next generation of nanomotors that can be applied in clinical studies. To
reduce phototoxicity, it is necessary that the motor operates with a high quantum yield, converting a high percent-
age of the absorbed photons into mechanical work to displace membrane lipids. Furthermore, tissue applications
require the irradiation wavelength to occur in the 600–1000 nm region, which penetrates deeper than the initially
used ultraviolet light, that also has higher phototoxicity. We will employ computational methods based on quantum
mechanics, molecular mechanics, and machine learning. Core of our study will be the real time simulation of the
photoinduced dynamics of the nanomotor in the membrane, yielding atomistic information about the membrane
disruption process. To this end we will use machine learning driven molecular dynamics. The machine learning
algorithm will be trained using quantum mechanical simulations. Based on the gained insights, several molecular
properties will be enhanced by modiﬁcations of the functional groups: a) binding afﬁnity to the membrane; b)
light absorption in the near infrared or visible region; c) absorption cross section and quantum yield. To obtain
candidate molecules we will employ in silico high-throughput screening based on exhaustive molecule generation
and machine learning of quantum mechanical properties. Candidates with improved properties will be synthe-
sized by the García-López lab and studied experimentally to gauge the validity of the predictions. The results
of this combined computational/experimental study will give a detailed atomistic picture of the dynamics of the
nanomotors membranes. The proposed molecular modiﬁcations will lead to a next generation of nanomotors,
opening this technology for clinical studies, leading to highly selective light-activated drugs."

A defining feature of cognitive flexibility is the ability to exert control over how information is
treated when acting upon it. This is important for decision making, which often involves
evaluating information from one's surroundings to select appropriate choices. Corticostriatal
circuits have been suggested to play critical roles in these decision processes, but their exact
contributions remain unresolved. Our long-term goal is to understand how corticostriatal circuits
contribute to flexible control of evidence evaluation and decision selection. Studies in rodents
have identified the frontal orienting field (FOF) in the cortex and the anterior dorsal striatum
(ADS) to which it projects as playing important roles in evidence evaluation and decision
selection. However, little is known about how this circuit controls the timescale of evidence
evaluation that guides decision selection, which is important for any situation where evidence is
acquired sequentially in time. Building on previous work, our overarching hypothesis is that the
ADS plays a role in controlling the period of influence of evidence on choices and that the FOF
plays a role in decision selection that is guided by information routed via the ADS. Here, we train
rats to perform a novel change detection task that we have developed to address these
questions. In Aim 1, we will identify contributions of the ADS to control the timescales of
evidence evaluation. We will use a combination of neural recordings and optogenetic
perturbation to study neural representations and associated circuit mechanisms. In Aim 2, we
will identify contributions of the FOF to free response decision selection with a parallel approach
as Aim 1, again combining neural recordings and optogenetic perturbations. In Aim 3, we will
measure the influence of the ADS and FOF on each other with simultaneous neural recordings
to inform mechanistic models of corticostriatal circuit contributions to evidence evaluation and
decision selection. The approach we take is innovative because the lab has developed novel
techniques, important refinements of cutting edge techniques, and extensions of established
techniques to previously unexplored questions. The contribution of this work is significant
because it will fill multiple major gaps in our knowledge about this critically important function
and clinically relevant circuit. Furthermore, because corticostriatal circuits and the functions
studied here are impacted by multiple brain disorders, an improved understanding of the
connection between the two will be useful for developing new mental health treatments and
avoiding side effects of treatments targeted to these brain circuits."

Long-term treatment with dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonists (neuroleptics) often causes
involuntary orofacial movements (lip smacking, tongue protrusion), termed tardive dyskinesia
(TD). Once established, TD is often irreversible. Given the crucial role these medications play in
the treatment of psychiatric disease, as well as their common usage in gastrointestinal disorders,
migraine, and other conditions, TD is unfortunately quite common. However, we know very little
about the physiological underpinnings of its induction or expression. Longstanding theories focus
on D2 receptor blockade and upregulation, but many tools used to develop these theories cannot
distinguish between D2 and D3 receptors, nor the role of receptors expressed in multiple cell
types. For this reason, it is unclear which dopamine receptors are critical to the induction of TD.
In addition, existing studies implicate dopamine signaling in both acute and chronic responses to
neuroleptics, but few if any studies have measured dopamine release or the physiological activity
of its striatal targets in freely moving animals experiencing TD. To address some of these gaps in
our understanding of TD, the proposed project will use an established mouse model of TD, based
on chronic administration of haloperidol, in conjunction with cell type-specific genetic and
physiological tools. First, we will test the necessity for D2 or D3 receptors in the induction and
expression of TD, through targeted deletion in specific cell types. Second, we will test the role of
striatal dopamine release in the induction and expression of TD in freely moving mice, monitoring
dopamine with the fluorescent dopamine sensor, dLight and manipulating dopamine with
chemogenetics. Third, we will test the role of striatal projection neurons in TD by monitoring or
manipulating neural activity with cell type-specific electrophysiology and photometry, or
optogenetics. In these latter components, we will use a head-mounted selfie-cam and automated
behavior detection to identify individual dyskinetic mouth movements at high temporal resolution.
This last innovation will permit alignment of dyskinetic movements to striatal dopamine release
and neural activity. Through these efforts, we hope to test longstanding hypotheses regarding the
origins of TD, but moreover to identify the physiological correlates of individual dyskinetic
movements. We hope these findings will point to new areas for therapeutic development, but also
deepen our understanding of how striatal microcircuit function contributes to the control of
voluntary (versus involuntary) movement."
10846561,"Background: Cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) are increasing in the US population, and adults
aged 50 and older are among the fastest growing groups of cannabis users. While cannabis use is increasing,
it is often perceived as harmless and marketed to patients as helpful for several conditions despite a lack of
evidence. There is no data on past month cannabis use, daily cannabis use, and CUD among Veterans using
primary care, but there is evidence that cannabis use is common in specific Veteran subgroups (11% to 25%)
and that CUD identified using administrative data is increasing.
Significance: There are reasons to be concerned about the potential under-identification of cannabis use
among Veterans. Smoking cannabis is the most common form of cannabis use among Veterans, and there is
evidence that cannabis use is associated with respiratory symptoms and cancer. Comorbid mental health
conditions are prevalent among Veterans, and these conditions are commonly reported as motivation for
regular cannabis use. Cannabis use negatively impacts treatment outcomes of Veterans with anxiety,
depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and use is associated with psychosis and suicidal
ideation. Symptoms of cannabis withdrawal can frequently be confused with symptoms of mental health
conditions by patients which can perpetuate use. Finally, there are effective behavioral treatments available for
CUD and several medications that have shown benefit in treatment of CUD and withdrawal from cannabis in
trials. It is important to identify cannabis users to ensure access to effective therapies.
Innovation and Impact: This proposal will address important gaps in the priority areas of women’s health,
substance use disorders, and mental health. This proposal will lay the foundation for the validation of a simple,
frequency-based screening measure for cannabis use that could be feasible in the primary care setting.
Specific Aims: We propose to improve our understanding of at-risk populations and determine whether
cannabis treatment services in the Veteran population are being underused. We also propose to determine if
certain use patterns are associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes, placing individuals at
higher risk. Such individuals (if identified) may also require brief intervention, referral, and/or treatment.
 Aim 1: To examine the patterns of cannabis use (past month use, daily use, CUD, persistent use),
behaviors (e.g., alcohol use) associated with use, and characteristics associated with use among a nationally
representative sample of Veterans 50 and older who receive VA primary care.
 Aim 2a: To determine whether Veterans discuss cannabis use with their providers and whether providers
document use and/or intervene upon use or CUD.
 Aim 2b: To explore provider experiences assessing cannabis use and initiating CUD-related treatment
and referrals in the primary care setting.
 Aim 3: Using the cohort created in Aim 1, we will prospectively examine the association of cannabis use
with depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, emergency department use, and all-cause hospitalization.
Methodology: We will construct a nationally representative cohort of Veterans 50 and older using VA data,
chart review and phone interviews. We will conduct qualitative interviews with primary care providers to
understand gaps in care.
Next Steps/Implementation: As with alcohol and tobacco, regular cannabis use may be effectively monitored
and managed with identification and brief intervention. This proposal will improve our understanding of the
prevalence of unidentified cannabis use and gaps in care in the primary care setting, the need for screening,
and improve our understanding of the harms associated with use. This proposal will lay the foundation for
addressing gaps in care related to cannabis use and CUD among older Veterans."
10848220,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is the major risk factor associated with chronic neck and low back pain,
ubiquitous health conditions that affects millions of people world-wide. There is an incomplete understanding
of the pathogenesis of disc degeneration partially due to lack of an appropriate animal model. Current animal
models primarily use traumatic insults to promote degeneration differing from most human cases of disc
degeneration. While, a few animal models of spontaneous disc degeneration are reported, several limitations
prevent their wide-spread use. Thus, there is a great need for small animal models that are more representative
of human disc pathology. Previous studies have investigated inbred strains of mice including SM/J and LG/J
for their regenerative ability. In contrast to LG/J, a “super healer” strain, SM/J was found to be a “poor healer”.
However, there no studies have investigated the disc health status in these strains of mice. We show for the first
time that SM/J mice exhibit spontaneous disc degeneration that captures important features of human disc
pathology. Based on our novel pilot data, we hypothesize that this degenerative phenotype has a strong genetic
basis and driven by early changes in cell phenotype, metabolism and senescence. We will investigate the
cellular and genetic mechanisms that underlie disc degeneration in SM/J mice in three Aims. In Aim 1 we will
test the hypothesis that disc degeneration in SM/J mice is characterized by compromised cell survival, altered
cell phenotype, metabolism and senescence. We will perform RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analysis of NP tissue of
SM/J and LG/J mice. We will also perform metabolomics to determine metabolic status of cells. These studies
will provide unbiased insights into temporal alterations in transcriptome and metabolism to delineate
pathways and mechanisms central to the pathogenesis of disc degeneration in SM/J mice. In Aim 2 we will
test the hypothesis that removal of senescent cells from the intervertebral disc slows down the progression of
disc degeneration in SM/J mice. Pilot studies have shown that there is an accumulation of senescent cells in
SM/J discs. We will treat ex vivo organ cultured discs and SM/J mice in vivo during early and established
stages of disc degeneration with well-characterized senolytic drugs and analyze metabolic, histopathological
and genetic changes. Lastly in Aim 3 we will delineate the genetic mechanisms that contribute to cell
senescence and disc degeneration in SM/J mice. We will perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
using LG/J x SM/J Advanced Intercross Lines (AILs) to discover regions of the mouse genome contributing to
differences in disc degeneration. For this purpose, AIL mice will be genotyped at 143,000 GIGAmuga chip
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discs from several mice will be used for RNA-Seq analysis.
Together, these data will be used to identify high-resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disc traits ~5 genes
per support interval. The genes responsible for these QTL will be identified. This aim will generate candidate
genes likely contributing to variation in the senescence and disc degeneration between LG/J and SM/J strains."

The overarching goal of the Asahina lab is to understand the neurogenetic mechanisms by which animals ad-
just tactics during social behaviors in a context-dependent manner. To this end, they study agonistic interac-
tions between Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. Flies choose between different types and intensities of social
behaviors based on both internal and external conditions (e.g., feeding status, mating status, outcomes of pre-
vious interactions). Powerful tools for manipulating gene and neuronal function in Drosophila with high preci-
sion provides a unique platform for understanding the neurogenetic mechanisms underlying this rich behavioral
flexibility. One major finding from the Asahina lab during the past 4 years is that a specific subset of octopamin-
ergic neurons suppress aggression, and that the transcriptional regulator nervy controls the expression of
genes necessary for these neurons to function as an aggression “brake”. They also characterized the genetic
origins of the functional differences between three male-specific aggression-promoting neurons. With the ability
to genetically control previously characterized aggression-promoting neurons and their development of novel
computational methodologies for characterizing agonistic interactions at fine resolution, goals of the Asahina
lab over the next five years are to: 1) elucidate how animals establish dominant-submissive hierarchies based
on experience, and 2) characterize the neuronal and genetic mechanisms by which deficits in specific nutrients
modulate behavioral tactics during competition for food. The first goal will be pursued by building upon their
recent finding that the dominant-submissive relationship can override experimental activation of aggression-
promoting neurons. They will test the prediction that experience-dependent modulation of aggressive behav-
iors is implemented by an uncharacterized neuronal or molecular mechanism. The second goal is inspired by
their finding that amino-acid deprivation dramatically increases aggression in both male and female flies, but
only when live yeast is present in the environment. They will elucidate how specific nutrition deficits alter the
function of aggression-controlling neuronal and genetic modules. These studies build upon strengths of the lab
in genetics and advanced behavioral quantification, plus their ingenuity in developing novel behavioral para-
digms for addressing longstanding questions in the field of animal behavior, most importantly: how do animals
strategically choose between behavioral options? Theoretical analyses have predicted that animals must have
evolved sophisticated mechanisms to integrate information and calculate costs and benefits associated with a
particular behavior during agonistic interactions. However, experimental systems to quantitatively characterize
the neural bases of these behavioral choices have remained elusive. The proposed experiments provide entry
points for solving this problem by re-defining functions of genes and neurons from the perspective of cost/ben-
efit calculations during competition. Proposed research will bridge this critical gap by illuminating operational
principles by which genes and neurons control context-dependent adjustment of social behaviors."

This proposal comprises a three-year research and career development program for Rachel Niec, MD, PhD to
achieve independence as an investigator at the intersection of immunology and intestinal epithelial biology. Dr.
Niec completed her doctoral training in immunology at Sloan Kettering Institute and Internal Medicine Residency
and Gastroenterology Fellowship at Weill Cornell Medical College. The research and career development
activities will occur at Rockefeller University. Dr. Niec will engage in career development activities including
didactics, workshops in grant writing and lab management, acquisition of technical skills and scientific expertise,
conference presentations, and a comprehensive mentorship program through her dedicated mentoring team.
Dr. Niec has a strong background in cell biology and, over the course of this K08 award at the Rockefeller
University, aims to expand her skills in advanced microscopy, transcriptomics and stem cell (SC) biology to study
how features of the intestinal SC (ISC) niche interpret diverse cues to direct SC activity in health and in disease.
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are inflammatory conditions focused within the intestinal epithelium and
driven by genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. Intestinal epithelial maintenance is dependent on ISC
which in turn rely on their niche for local signals to direct their activity. While many niche factors emanate from
local sources, intestinal epithelial tissues is subject to systemic changes suggesting vascular features may
regulate ISC activity. While lymphatics abnormalities have long been appreciated as a feature of IBD, the
vascular features of the intestinal niche that control ISC behavior are unknown. The central hypothesis is
vasculature is a key regulator of ISC function, through direct signaling between vasculature, ISC and other niche
cells. Two specific aims are proposed: (1) Define the contribution of lymphatic capillaries to the cellular network
comprising the intestinal stem cell niche; (2) Determine the impact of lymphatic derived Reln and lymphatic:stem
cell interactions on ISC maintenance and function. These aims will be addressed using tissue clearing and
advanced 3D imaging, established and newly developed single cell and spatial resolution transcriptomics, and
novel in vitro coculture and in vivo molecular genetic approaches. The significance of this proposal lies in its
relevance to fundamental mechanism of epithelial maintenance and regeneration and to pathogenesis of IBD.
The proposal is innovative in the combination of advanced methods in imaging and transcriptomics and their
application to SC niche biology and intestinal inflammation. Long-term, Dr. Niec aims to apply the expertise
gained to identify environmental and inflammatory signals that maintain and regulate the intestinal SC niche in
homeostasis and disease to improve prevention and treatment of IBD."

 Our long-term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms of telomerase regulation and telomere
homeostasis during development. Telomerase elongates telomeres to compensate for their loss during cell
proliferation. Its regulation is critical for human aging and susceptibilities to cancer and many age-related
degenerative diseases. The TERT gene, encoding the human telomerase reverse transcriptase, is regulated
primarily at the level of transcription. It is highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells, but stringently repressed in
most somatic cells. Recent progresses on telomerase regulation in cancer cells have greatly improved our
understanding of TERT gene activation during cancer development. However, the mechanisms of its repression
in most differentiated cells and expression in certain somatic cells remain to be elucidated. Regulation of
transcription during development and differentiation often involves distal elements and chromatin reorganization.
We previously reported that the endogenous TERT gene was embedded in a condensed chromatin domain and
stringently repressed in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner in somatic cells. To identify distal regulatory
sequences required for establishing the repressive chromatin of the TERT locus and to understand its regulation
in vivo, our laboratory has developed two innovative technical platforms in the past decade. The first is
recombinase-mediated BAC targeting or RMBT method, for targeted integration of single-copy BAC reporters
into specified chromosomal sites. This technique, together with the new CRISPR-mediated gene editing, enables
us to study distal regulatory elements of the TERT gene in their genomic contexts. Consequently, we have
discovered that a polymorphic tandem DNA repeat in intron 2 (VNTR2-1) functions as an enhancer for TERT
transcription. In addition, we have engineered a humanized mTert allele (hmTert) for studying human-specific
telomerase regulation in mice. In the next funding period, we plan to use these tools and focus on the following
three directions: (1) Identify transcription factors that regulate TERT gene via VNTR2-1; (2) Identify key distal
regulatory elements responsible for TERT repression; and (3) Study the roles of these distal elements in
regulating telomere homeostasis in vivo using our mouse model with humanized telomeres. In short, using our
unique tools, we will address some of the fundamental mechanisms critical to telomerase regulation and
telomere homeostasis in humans, and ultimately telomere-associated human diseases."

 Messenger RNA splicing is carried out by a large macromolecular machine, the spliceosome,
which undergoes dramatic rearrangements as it assembles onto a pre-messenger RNA. Our
understanding of this elegant ribonucleoprotein machine has advanced significantly with the
availability of cryoEM structures and an extensive “parts list” of splicing components. However, many
questions remain about how spliceosome assembly takes place in the cell, where the spliceosome
machinery assembles onto a nascent transcript that is being actively transcribed from a chromatin
template, i.e. co-transcriptionally. Moreover, assembly of the spliceosome and splicing catalysis is
tightly regulated and, in fact, there are widespread examples across eukaryotes of intron retention.
Nonetheless, the regulatory consequences of this phenomenon remain obscure. Guided by strong
preliminary data, we explore both of these outstanding challenges and address the following
questions: (1) How does chromatin influence spliceosome assembly and vice versa, i.e. how does
co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly affect the state of the chromatin? (2) How does intron
retention contribute to gene regulation? (3) How does mis-regulation of intron accumulation lead to
cellular toxicity and disease?

Transposable Elements (TEs) make up a large fraction of vertebrate genomes, including half of the
human genome. The mutagenic properties of TEs are well documented and they are important drivers of
genetic variation between and within species. However, how this enormous source of genetic variation
has shaped the evolution and biology of species remains poorly understood. Our MIRA project is
designed to yield transformative insights into the biological significance of TEs in evolution and disease.
Our previous research has focused on the long-term impact of vertebrate TEs in driving genetic
innovations. Notably, we showed that TEs have been a recurrent source of raw sequence material co-
opted during vertebrate evolution to create new cis-regulatory elements driving changes in gene
expression and new protein-coding genes underlying the emergence of novel cellular functions. Most of
these events involved ancient TEs long inactive transpositionally. In this next funding cycle, we are turning
our attention to young TEs -- those recently or currently mobile. We focus on the developmental impact
of young TEs in humans and in zebrafish, a powerful model organism for studies of vertebrate
development. By focusing on the functional impact of young retroelements in embryonic development we
will uncover the molecular underpinnings of evolutionarily recent biological innovations. Notably, we will
investigate the regulatory contribution of TEs in defining features of the human placenta, such as its deep
invasion into maternal decidual tissue, and the functional significance of endogenous viral-like particles
produced in the early stages of human embryonic development. Our work will also uncover general principles
that lead to the cooption of specific TE sequences for cellular function. Specifically, we will test a new
provocative model of host-TE interaction in which organismal development becomes dependent on TE-
encoded products. We will test this ‘addiction model’ by studying the trans-regulatory activities of Gag (capsid)
proteins encoded by endogenous retroviruses in human and zebrafish for which we have obtained preliminary
evidence they modulate embryonic developmental processes. The outcomes of this project are expected to
shift our view of host-TE interactions from conflicting to mutualistic. Our studies will also yield new mechanistic
insights into poorly understood disease processes, such as pregnancy loss by preeclampsia and
neurodevelopmental disorders, implicating the dysregulation of young TEs."

 Our lab is dedicated to the mechanistic understanding of macromolecular function through the visualization of
structure, dynamics, and regulatory interactions. Towards that goal, we use cryo-EM, together with biochemical
and biophysical assays. Our areas of study are centered on the characterization of the regulatory molecular
mechanisms governing the function of microtubules and of human transcription/epigenetic complexes.
 Microtubules (MTs) are essential polymers in eukaryotic cells s built of -tubulin dimers. Dynamic instability,
the switching between growing and shrinking phases due to the coupling of the assembly process to the exchange
and hydrolysis of GTP in -tubulin, is an essential property for MT function. Many MT cellular partners modulate
MT dynamics or utilize it to carry out specific functions. In the past. In the last 5 years, we confirmed and
complemented our past studies, which used non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs to characterize conformational
changes in MTs that accompany GTP hydrolysis, now using of GTP-hydrolysis tubulin mutants. We also defined
the mode of binding and action of cellular factors that regulate MT assembly, dynamics and organization in the
cell and described the effect of tubulin acetylation on MT structure and function. We will continue this work with
the central theme of adding complexity to our studies in order to bring us closer to the regulated function of
microtubule cellular systems as we also add techniques complementary to our major tool, cryo-EM.
 Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is critical for growth and survival, and of obvious significance to
human health. Its initiation involves RNA polymerase II (Pol II) together with TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and
TFIIH. Regulation is achieved by sequence-specific activators or repressors, co-factors, and chromatin
remodeling/modifying complexes. During the last funding period we defined the structures of human TFIID[17] and
TFIIH[18], as well as other large transcriptional coactivators like the human SAGA[19], and the yeast NuA4 (in
preparation) and RSC complexes[20]. We will now characterize the human TIP60 complex, the binding of
transcriptional co-activators to chromatin substrates, and pursue the dynamic visualization of TFIID engagement
with promoter DNA to gain further knowledge of how these complexes work in the nucleus to regulate gene
expression.
 Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is an epigenetic gene silencer that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3
and is essential for cellular differentiation and development. After obtaining the structure of human PRC2 with its
cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 and its interaction with a di-nucleosome, we have now defined how PRC2
recognizes mono-ubiquitylated nucleosome, the substrate created by the other major Polycomb complex, PRC1.
We will now further characterize the regulatory landscape of PRC2 looking into other histone modifications,
different forms of PRC2 (i.e., other cofactors), the role of PRC2 auto-methylation, and binding of PRC2 to RNA."

Native Hawaiians have the highest prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases of any population in Hawai‘i. Diet is
strongly implicated as a cause of these disparities. Native Hawaiians historically consumed a diet rich in fish,
fresh fruits, and vegetables, but Westernization led to profound shifts in food systems. The Hawaiian Homes
Commission Act established a land base for Native Hawaiians to engage in subsistence living and practice their
culture. However, today only 20% of Native Hawaiian homesteaders consume at least 1 serving of vegetables
per day compared with 73% of other Native Hawaiians. Homesteaders also have twice the prevalence of diet-
related diseases (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) than other Native Hawaiians. We have
developed a multilevel intervention to promote healthy eating, weight loss, and cardiovascular health for
overweight/obese Native Hawaiian adults entitled “PILI ‘Āina.” At the individual-level PILI ‘Āina provides 3 months
of culturally tailored education based on the Diabetes Prevention Program’s Lifestyle Intervention. The education
aims to improve self-management of prevalent cardiometabolic disease (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia) and to reduce risk factors for developing new diet-related illness. PILI ‘Āina also includes a 6-
month household-level component that provides home garden materials and training as a means of connecting
with traditional NH culture, values, and lifestyle in the home environment. A pilot study of PILI ‘Āina was well-
received by participants, with 100% retention over 9 months and promising results for cardiometabolic outcomes.
We will now conduct a group-randomized controlled trial of PILI ‘Āina on 7 O‘ahu homesteads. First, we will
interview the past PILI ‘Āina pilot participants to refine the intervention to better support year-round home
gardening and a traditional Native Hawaiian diet. Second, we will conduct a group-randomized controlled trial
to test the efficacy of PILI ‘Āina compared to a control group among 180 adult homesteaders with
overweight/obesity who have at least 1 other cardiometabolic disease. Data collection will occur at baseline and
3, 9, and 12 months. Primary outcomes are diet quality, adiposity, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and lipids.
Secondary outcomes are behavioral and psychosocial factors (e.g., physical activity, self-efficacy) that might
mediate effects on primary outcomes. Third, a community-level program will feature traditional cooking and
tasting events on all 7 homesteads. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Refine the PILI ‘Āina intervention to optimize
its effectiveness for improving diet and managing diet-related cardiometabolic diseases on Native Hawaiian
homesteads; 2) Test the efficacy of PILI ‘Āina compared to a control group for improving diet, biomarkers, and
behavioral and psychosocial risk factors among homesteaders with diet-related cardiometabolic diseases; and
3) Evaluate the ability of community-wide food demonstrations to promote traditional diets and improve social
cohesion on Native Hawaiian homesteads. Results will address the American Heart Association’s call for
evidence-based programs to improve diet at the household level for preventing cardiovascular disease."
10830279,"Cilia are microtubule-based cellular extensions that play key roles in sensing the extracellular environment,
processing developmental signals and generating propulsive force and fluid flow. They also act as secretory
organelles releasing bioactive vesicular ectosomes involved in cell-cell communication and other processes.
Cilia are ancient and complex; in humans, ~5% of all genes are involved in their formation/activity and defects
result in complex syndromes or ciliopathies. For many years, my laboratory has been broadly interested in the
assembly and function of motile cilia, and has a strong record of identifying new opportunities and pursuing them
to reveal novel aspects of ciliary biology – most recently we demonstrated that cilia act as a source of peptidergic
signals. For most studies, we utilize the biciliate unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas as a model due to the
ease of biochemical analysis and large array of molecular genetic approaches available. Over the next five
years, we will pursue two broad areas of focus to address what I consider key questions in ciliary biology.
Although superficially distinct, these two areas are intimately connected, and I anticipate we will be able to
integrate them to yield novel insights into conserved and essential cilia-based pathways.
1) Ciliary Motility: dissecting the dynein motors and control systems that generate ciliary beating and power
retrograde intraflagellar transport (IFT). We plan to focus on three major issues. We will dissect the complex
pathways by which axonemal and IFT dyneins are synthesized and assembled in cytoplasm employing our
newly devised biochemical fractionation methods. Building a cilium is an immensely complex problem in
macromolecular assembly and we will examine how assembly factors control the axonemal incorporation of
outer dynein arms at precise locations on doublet microtubules. We will also study axonemal dynein motor
regulation to a) determine how responses to alterations in Ca2+ and redox poise are combined with curvature
sensing to yield integrated changes in motility, and b) assess how cells sense imposed changes in ciliary beating
and respond by increasing intraciliary levels of the dynein regulator Lis1.
2) Cilia Formation and Peptidergic Signaling: studying the peptide amidating enzyme (peptidylglycine -
amidating monooxygenase; PAM) and its amidated bioactive products in ciliary assembly and cilia-based cell-
cell communication. We recently demonstrated that active PAM occurs in cilia and that PAM loss leads to the
failure of ciliogenesis and disrupts dynein-driven retrograde IFT. Furthermore, PAM-generated amidated
bioactive products are released in cilia-derived vesicular ectosomes and one acts as a chemotactic modulator.
We will build on these observations to identify novel amidated PAM products involved in cilia formation. We will
dissect the pathways leading to regulated amidated product release in ciliary ectosomes and determine
where/when processing of the precursors occurs. We will also pursue the amidated product receptors and their
downstream signaling pathways, which lead to differential regulation of the two motile cilia and chemotaxis."
10824415,"TRANSLATIONAL PATHOLOGY CORE LABORATORY SHARED RESOURCE (TPCL) 
ABSTRACT 
The Translational Pathology Core Laboratory (TPCL), a UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) 
Shared Resource since 1998, provides pathology services critical for basic, translational, clinical, and population 
cancer research. TPCL provides a College of American Pathologists accredited human tissue biobank, histology 
(animal/human; frozen/formalin-fixed paraffin embedded), laser capture microdissection, immunohistochemistry 
and in-situ hybridization services (established/new antibody optimization), and pathology consultation services. 
TPCL connects cancer researchers with subspecialty pathologists and was an early adopter of digital pathology, 
assisting with custom digital image analysis algorithms for complex evaluations of tissue sections. 
TPCL provided essential services and materials for numerous, recent high-impact studies, including work 
demonstrating that a sodium-glucose transporter is a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in early-stage 
lung adenocarcinoma, and that therapy-induced tumor secretomes promote resistance and tumor progression. 
TPCL supports many clinical trials, including a recent UCLA-led investigator-initiated clinical trial of dual-cell 
immunotherapy, combining a NY-ESO-1 specific T cell receptor adoptively transferred with NY-ESO-1 peptide- 
pulsed dendritic cell vaccination, with or without ipilimumab-induced CTLA-4 blockade. 
During 2013 – 2018, TPCL developed four-color multiplexed immunofluorescence (MIF) staining for the 
Leica/Aperio slide scanner, which is a unique scanner capability, introduced nine-color MIF with a Perkin-Elmer 
Polaris system, created processes to identify and retrieve remnant biofluids with customized clinical variables, 
initiated a video universal electronic consent for biobanking, built research blood draw order capabilities within 
routine clinical lab orders, collaborated on a UC Virtual Biobank, and added biofluid acquisition, processing and 
storage. TPCL fees are similar to or lower than those of other cancer centers within Los Angeles County. During 
the prior project period, 153 JCCC members from all six Research Programs used TPCL representing 69% of 
overall usage. Their usage resulted in 334 publications, 49% of which were in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field 
leading) journals. TPCL is centrally located to most JCCC labs and occupies ~6,400 sf. 
TPCL Director Sarah Dry, MD (ZY), and Co-Directors Samuel French, MD, PhD (ZY) and Dawn Ward, MD, are 
board-certified, practicing pathologists who conduct basic, translational, and clinical research. Since 2013, Dry 
co-led the UCLA biobanking consent effort, with 39,700 consents in 24 months, using a novel video e-consent 
process. Dry also initiated efforts leading to current TPCL collaborations with UC Davis on a University of 
California (UC) Virtual Biobank. 
Exciting future TPCL directions to support and benefit JCCC research include: (1) Automated IF/combined 
IF/RNA-ISH staining; (2) Increased clinical variable searches for remnant biofluids; (3) Facilitated use of research 
blood draw requests by non-clinicians; and (4) Continued development of the UC Virtual Biobank."
10809686,"Desmosomes are adhesive intercellular junctions that play critical roles in epidermal
homeostasis by mediating robust cell-cell adhesion and by modulating signaling pathways that
regulate epidermal differentiation. The importance of desmosomes is highlighted by numerous
autoimmune and inherited skin diseases that compromise desmosome function and cause epidermal
fragility. These diseases include pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a severe autoimmune epidermal blistering
disease caused by autoantibodies (IgG) directed against the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein-3
(Dsg3), and severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome caused by
DSG1 loss of function mutations. Our previous studies of PV revealed that desmosomal proteins are
associated with lipid rafts, and our recent findings indicate that a mutation in the Dsg1TMD that
abrogates lipid raft association, compromises desmosome formation, and causes SAM syndrome.
Lipid rafts are important for a variety of cellular functions, including signaling, endocytosis and
membrane domain formation. The important role of lipid rafts in regulating Dsg function in different
skin diseases underscores the importance of Dsg association with lipid rafts in normal desmosome
function and epidermal homeostasis. We hypothesize that Dsg association with rafts is required for
desmosome assembly, segregation from adherens junctions, and for Dsg adhesive and signaling
activities necessary for epidermal homeostasis. The experiments outlined in this proposal are
designed to reveal the raft targeting features of desmosomal cadherins, how raft association
regulates desmosome and adherens junction membrane domain formation, and how loss of Dsg raft
association leads to SAM syndrome. The outcome of these studies will produce fundamentally new
conceptual models for desmosome regulation and will form a foundation for the treatment of skin
diseases associated with loss of desmosome function."
10824419,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gram-negative bacteria constitute the majority of antibiotic resistant organisms identified as urgent threats to
human health by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A major reason why Gram-negative bacteria
are resistant to modern antibiotics is the impermeable nature of their outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
layer. This impermeable nature is due to the strong lateral interaction between neighboring LPS molecules that
includes lipid A, the core saccharide, and the O-antigen. Nanotherapeutics capable of overcoming this barrier to
successfully deliver antibiotics to Gram-negative bacteria will be of immense importance for human health. It is
our intent to develop such nanotherapeutics by using the knowledge attained from delineating the mechanism
by which a Gram-negative bacteriophage fuses its external bacterial phospholipid (BPL) membrane with the
LPS of its host for initiating infection. Embedded into the Cystovirus BPL are multimeric protein complexes,
referred to as spikes, that recognize the Gram-negative host and perform fusion. These proteins are analogous
to, but different from, the better studied eukaryotic proteins responsible for membrane fusion (e.g. HIV env, West
Nile Virus glycoprotein E, and Herpesviridae gB protein). The intent of this proposal is to investigate the
mechanism by which spikes from three different members of the Cystovirus family recognize their hosts and
drive membrane fusion. The goals of this proposal are to determine the structure of the spikes for establishing a
structural scaffold for biochemical and biophysical studies (Aim 1), determine the mechanism of cellular
recognition (Aim 2), and determine the biochemical determinants responsible for LPS- BPL fusion (Aim 3). The
long-term goal of this project is to use the spikes for delivery of antibiotics to specific strains of pathogenic Gram-
negative bacteria."

Immunotherapy has become an emerging standard-of-care (SOC) for many different cancer types. However,
only 15-20% of patients receive durable benefit. Other limitations include the toxicity of systemically-delivered
immunomodulators which may require frequent, high doses and lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
The risk of severe, and potentially fatal, irAEs increases as the field moves towards immune/immune and
immune/SOC combination therapies. As the “front line” of tumor/immune interaction, the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is a critical locus of immunomodulation, where the kinds of immunocytes in the TIME
predict the likelihood of response to diverse immunotherapies. One strategy to favorably modulate the TIME is
to localize multiple immunotherapeutics at the tumor through direct intratumoral delivery, reversing the
immunosuppressive TIME while promoting anti-tumor effector cell immunity. This can enhance local
concentration of drugs while minimizing systemic exposure and likelihood and severity of irAEs. The use of
biomaterials as platforms for cancer immunotherapy provides the potential to intelligently direct and modulate
immune cells in situ. Our drug-mimicking, peptide nanofiber hydrogel called “SynerGel” is at the forefront of this
field, with the ability to deplete suppressive immune cells while simultaneously releasing diverse factors in a
controlled manner within a specific volume. These multiple abilities allow for reduced off-target toxicity, dose-
sparing, and targeting of multiple immune pathways to address the heterogeneous nature of cancers. The overall
hypothesis of this proposal is that intratumoral injection of SynerGel renders immunologically refractory tumors
sensitive to immune-mediated killing through multiple mechanisms including: 1) optimization of local
effector/suppressor immunocyte ratios, 2) prolonged release of immune-stimulating agents, and 3) enhanced
activation of recruited effector immunocytes. We propose to improve on the efficacy of our “first generation”
MDP-based hydrogel system by designing a unique injectable, combinatorial immunotherapy platform based on
the drug-mimicking next-generation MDP hydrogel called SynerGel in three aims: Aim 1 will evaluate SynerGel
as an injectable, highly customizable cancer immunotherapy platform able to perform sustained delivery of
multiple immunotherapeutics to the TIME. Aim 2 will explore the immunologic mechanisms contributing to
SynerGel-mediated amelioration of the adverse HNSCC tumor microenvironment. Aim 3 will investigate the
combination of SynerGel immunotherapy with standard-of-care radiotherapy (RT), looking to identify specific
immune mechanisms induced by the combination of RT and immunomodulation, and allowing for effective
therapy de-escalation by eliminating the need for chemotherapy, thus decreasing toxicity. By successfully
accomplishing these aims, we hope to clarify the molecular/cellular mechanisms by which SynerGel can reverse
resistance to both standard-of-care RT and immunomodulatory therapy in solid tumors and provide insights into
how the adverse tumor microenvironment can be rendered more susceptible to immunotherapy."
10833042,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Alzheimers disease (AD) clinical trials have primarily been anti-Aβ and anti-tau centric, however this
single-target therapeutic approach has not been successful so far. The idea that AD can be stopped, or
delayed by targeting a single pathological event, needs revision and a multi-level therapeutic approach is
needed for AD. Limited multi-level approaches have been tested for AD but have failed primarily due to
inappropriate time of treatment, side-effects and lack of brain penetration. A promising multi-level therapeutic
approach is to target TNF-α which plays a central role at multiple stages of AD pathology. Existing biologic
TNF-α inhibitors (TNFIs) are thus a potential treatment for AD, however, do not cross the blood-brain barrier
(BBB). No study still date has developed a BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI for AD and this application aims to
fill this gap, and focuses on the development of a BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI for AD. The model biologic
TNFI in the current application is etanercept, which is a type-II TNF-α decoy receptor (TNFR)-Fc fusion protein.
We have fused TNFR to a chimeric antibody against the mouse transferrin receptor (cTfRMAb), wherein the
cTfRMAb domain acts as a molecular Trojan horse to ferry the TNFR into the brain non-invasively via the
transvascular route. We have recently shown that this BBB-penetrating cTfRMAb-TNFR fusion protein results
in better therapeutic indices than etanercept (non-BBB-penetrating TNFI) in AD mice, underscoring the need
for brain delivery of the biologic TNFI. Our central hypothesis is that systemic administration of cTfRMAb-
TNFR, which modulates both peripheral and neural TNF-α, intervenes at multiple levels of AD pathology and is
thus therapeutic in AD. In the proposed studies, we will utilize two different AD mice (APPswe, PSEN1dE9
double and 3xTg triple transgenic mice), ages 4- and 12-months to mimic early- and late-stage AD, and treat
with vehicle, cTfRMAb-TNFR, etanercept or cTfRMAb systemically 3 days/week for 12-weeks. The following
specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: Optimize dose-response and therapeutic time-window of the BBB-
penetrating biologic TNFI. The effect on neuropathological hallmarks (Aβ and tau), and clinical hallmark
(cognitive deficit) will be studied using three doses (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg and 6 mg/kg). Aim 2: Characterize the
mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of the BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI. The effects on
markers of inflammation, BBB function, oxidative stress and synaptic/neuronal loss will be determined. Aim 3:
Evaluate the adverse effects associated with chronic dosing of the BBB-penetrating biologic TNFI. Both
cTfRMAb- and TNF-α inhibition-relevant adverse-effects will be studied. These studies will help optimize the
lowest dose that results in a high efficacy to toxicity ratio, outline the therapeutic time-window for TNF-α
inhibition, identify mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of cTfRMAb-TNFR which may enable the
identification of new targets, and will provide the necessary pre-clinical results that will advance the
development of cTfRMAb-TNFR for AD in humans."

Cross-coupling reactions provide the most reliable and modular means to diverse chemical space, enabling the
discovery of novel pharmaceuticals and elucidation of critical biological pathways. Seminal efforts spanning the
last century have led to the development of a variety of metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions that allow
efficient chemical bonds formation. However, these powerful chemical transformations still have shortcomings.
Endeavors in developing novel coupling methodologies could address the identified challenges in the chemical
literature. More importantly, they can be deployed to rapidly synthesize structurally and topologically complex
compounds from accessible starting materials. Our research laboratory is seeking to invent new synthetic
approaches to address this identified gap in the cross-coupling literature, specifically focusing on methodology
development with the nonmetal element sulfur, one of the most abundant and inexpensive starting materials with
versatile oxidation states (–2 to +6). We propose high valent sulfur complexes can enable diverse coupling
modes in either stoichiometric or catalytic fashions. This proposal is organized into three sections with the goal
of addressing current limitations in synthetic methodology and affording the ability to rapidly generate diverse
and complex small molecule libraries. The first portion of this proposal illustrates a plan for sulfurane-mediated
hindered C(sp2) and C(sp3) coupling via S(IV) to S(II) reduction. The second section illustrates how nonmetal
sulfur (S(VI) to S(IV)) can provide a general and practical solution to alkyl boronate synthesis, especially for
unprotected alkyl boronic acids. The last part of this proposal argues that persulfuranes have the potential to
mediate synthetically valuable C–F bond formation, even possibly in a catalytic manner (S(VI) ↔ S(IV)). These
described methods will enable facile access to scaffolds of interest for medicinal chemistry and biological
evaluation. The biological properties of several families of compounds will be further investigated through our
already established collaborations. Taken together, these innovative new synthetic modes could address the
synthesis of challenging and medicinally relevant chemical scaffolds."

 Ulcerative colitis is a complex disease caused by a combination of genetic risk factors,
childhood exposure to environmental risk factors and a poorly defined microbiota component.
Ulcerative colitis is associated with imbalance in the microbiota (dysbiosis) characterized by
increased Enterobacteriaceae and reduced Clostridia abundance. Ulcerative colitis can respond
to antibiotic treatment, which suggests that dysbiosis exacerbates intestinal inflammation, thus
raising the question as to how microbiota homeostasis can be restored. Our preliminary data
suggest that epithelial hypoxia and epithelial release of hydrogen peroxide represent host control
mechanisms that maintain homeostasis in the colon and that facultative anaerobic
Enterobacteriaceae exacerbates colitis when these host control mechanisms become weakened
by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. Our central hypothesis is that
increased epithelial oxygenation drives an expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae
that exacerbate colitis because members of this family are not excluded by growth conditions
encountered in close proximity to the epithelial surface. In specific aim 1 we will test the working
hypothesis that rebalancing the gut microbiota by reinstating epithelial hypoxia represents a
feasible approach for restoring gut homeostasis. In specific aim 2 we will determine how
Enterobacteriaceae exacerbate colitis in mice carrying a genetic risk factor while being exposed
to a combination of environmental risk factors. Successful completion of the proposed work will
be of broad significance for research on microbial ecology in the gut, the dynamics of gut-
associated microbial communities during inflammation and the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis."

Background: VA's Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation's Whole Health (WH)
Implementation Guide states: ""Whole Health should not be isolated to one specific service line, but instead is
the transformation of care in every service line within a VA facility."" Yet, the current implementation efforts are
focused on primary and mental healthcare service lines. Specialty care plays an important role in the WH
System of Care, particularly for Veterans who receive a preponderance of care outside primary care. HIV
specialty care is a case in point. Because of the history of HIV, many Veterans with HIV get both specialty and
primary care consolidated in their HIV clinics, thus potentially limiting their exposure to WH. Further, a WH
approach may be particularly valuable for these Veterans because of their combined challenges of aging,
comorbidities and unique social circumstances, including living with a disease intertwined with blame, stigma
and marginalization. Thus, HIV specialty care clinics provide an exemplary case to further develop WH
implementation guidance for specialty care services.
Significance: Implementation guidance on specialty care’s role in the WH System of Care has yet to be fully
developed. Primary care-based implementation relies on WH champions, training, leadership support and
system strategies to address Veterans’ unique care plans, including coordination across services. Like other
specialty care services, the structure of HIV care is vastly different from large, integrated primary care teams. A
plan for WH implementation in specialty care settings is thus needed.
Innovation & Impact: Implementation plans, co-developed with end users, attend to contextually situated
needs and are more likely to be successful. This proposal leverages the expertise of Veterans with HIV, HIV
providers and leadership to co-design implementation of WH in HIV specialty care. Co-design is a novel
participatory method that goes beyond traditional engagement strategies, like research interviews, by including
end users as equal members of the team. We will identify and work with key stakeholders in HIV specialty care
(e.g., Veterans, HIV providers and leadership) to co-design a WH implementation blueprint, detailing core
implementation features (e.g., the actors in implementation efforts, the actions they take, the targets of their
actions, the timing of these actions). Moreover, because the intersection of aging, vulnerability and stigma are
emblematic of challenges to caring for many Veteran populations, our blueprint can serve as an exemplar to
coordinating a WH approach across VA primary and specialty care settings, truly offering the systems
approach envisioned by VA.
Specific Aims: We will develop a WH implementation blueprint through the following aims: 1) Understand the
extent to which Veterans with HIV are currently receiving WH care at the 18 WH Flagship sites. 2) Examine
providers’ and Veterans’ perspectives on WH Clinical Care to learn how they think WH can be implemented in
HIV specialty care settings. 3) Working with key stakeholders - Veterans with HIV, HIV providers and
leadership - co-design a blueprint for WH implementation in HIV specialty care settings.
Methodology: This three-year study uses a mixed-methods design. Aim 1 uses administrative and survey
data to quantitatively describe the receipt and use of WH by Veterans with HIV. Aim 2 uses semi-structured,
qualitive interviews to explore HIV providers’ and Veterans’ views of WH with attention to strategies that might
support or undermine a WH approach to HIV clinical care. Aim 3 uses co-design methods to bring together an
expert panel of Veterans and HIV providers, identified in Aims 1 and 2, and leadership.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our blueprint will provide the Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural
Transformation a pragmatic guide to help VA facilities determine how to implement WH in specialty care."

COVID-19 has had major mental health impacts across the United States. The economic, livelihood, social and
other effects brought on by the pandemic have affected most of the national population, regardless of COVID-
19 infection. New York City (NYC) has had one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates, and it has
disproportionately affected NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations (e.g., Black, Latinx). In
humanitarian crisis such as this, there is a need for delivery of psychological interventions by non-specialists
when specialists are unable to meet the increased service demand. In the U.S., training staff at community-
based organizations (CBOs) to deliver psychological support has been highlighted as a way to increase
availability of mental health services and increase access to mental health care, particularly for underserved
populations. We propose to employ a mental health task-sharing model by partnering with CBOs in NYC to
train CBO staff without professional mental health training to deliver mental health services. We will examine
the impact of CBO staff delivering mental health services to (a) reduce the negative mental health
consequences of the pandemic, and (b) improve public health behaviors to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
We propose a cluster randomized control trial (cRCT) in NYC comparing Services as Usual (SAU arm) and
delivery of mental health services with Problem Management Plus (PM+) (Intervention arm) among
participating CBOs within the ThriveNYC consortium. The target condition will be depression. In Aim 1, we will
evaluate mental health outcomes of COVID-19 vulnerable populations served by CBOs integrating PM+ into
their other activities compared to CBOs delivering SAU. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the difference between the
Intervention and SAU arms on COVID-19 risk prevention adherence among populations served by the CBOs.
In Aim 3, we will evaluate implementation science outcomes to inform policy recommendations for of
community-based delivery of psychological interventions and inclusion of mental health within the infectious
disease response measures. Successful completion of these aims will contribute to the 2020 NIMH Strategic
Plan. Specifically, a) employing implementation science to maximize the public health impact of research for
improving effectiveness and reach of mental health services, especially for minority groups and other
underserved populations, b) strengthening research-practice partnerships to expedite adoption, sustained
implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services, and c) developing
innovative service delivery models to dramatically improve outcomes of mental health services received in
diverse communities and populations."

Dr. Deepika Slawek’s overall goal is to improve health outcomes in people living with HIV (PLWH), with a focus
on determining the impact of medical cannabis. PLWH have a high burden of pain, and most commonly
experience neuropathic pain. It is associated with significant disability, including functional impairment, poor
antiretroviral adherence, and virologic failure. Neuropathic pain in PLWH is related to persistent systemic
inflammation despite virologic suppression and is deeply interrelated with psychological symptoms. It is
frequently managed with opioids, despite a high risk of misuse and use disorder, prompting interest in
alternative therapies for pain like medical cannabis. Medical cannabis use is explosively increasing in the
United States, and pain and HIV are qualifying conditions in most states. Though medical cannabis
successfully reduced pain in the few randomized control trials completed to date, there remain gaps in our
understanding of how medical cannabis affects neuropathic pain in PLWH. No studies have evaluated how the
main active components of medical cannabis, ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) impact
neuropathic pain in PLWH; none have occurred with products comparable to those dispensed at medical
cannabis dispensaries; none have examined the impact medical cannabis has on inflammation; and none have
studied how medical cannabis impacts adverse events (e.g., psychological symptoms, antiretroviral
adherence, and virologic failure). Federal policies make conducting a randomized trial of medical cannabis for
the management of chronic pain in PLWH infeasible. Therefore, this study will employ two coupons that
provide deep discounts to medical cannabis products that are legally dispensed in New York. This K23
mentored patient-oriented career development award will train Dr. Slawek in skills necessary to be successful
in the fields of HIV and cannabis research. These are: 1) design and conduct of randomized trials, 2)
translational cannabis research, 3) causal inference, and 4) mediation analysis. These skills will be applied to
an innovative study to test how coupons that provide deep discounts for high THC medical cannabis products
or high CBD medical cannabis products affect neuropathic pain, inflammation, and adverse events in PLWH.
Through a multidisciplinary mentorship team, formal coursework, and the proposed research project, Dr.
Slawek will achieve the professional growth needed to become an independent investigator contributing critical
findings that will be integral to the care of PLWH."
10821359,"Heart failure progression is a complex biological process that is precipitated by the maladaptive myocardial
response to injury, compounded by failure of the adult heart to replace lost or damaged cardiomyocytes.
Conceivably, identifying common pathways that regulate these two seemingly unrelated processes would
profoundly impact therapeutic strategies to prevent, and even reverse heart failure progression. Numerous
observations by members of the proposed consortium and others support the notion that the endogenous
capacity of the neonatal mammalian heart to proliferate fades in the early postnatal life as a switch from
hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes takes place. Members of the proposed consortium and
others have also previously demonstrated that mechanisms linked to activation of innate immune response may
play a role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, death and even stimulation of new cardiomyocyte
generation. However, whether mechanisms involved in cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest also play a role in the
maladaptive cardiomyocyte response to injury is not known. Indeed, critical components of the inflammatory
response appear to underlie both cardiac rejuvenation after injury through positive effects on healing, as well
as stimulating cardiomyocytes to proliferate. Therefore, the current proposal brings together 5 groups with
expertise in myocardial remodeling, regeneration and immunology with the overall goal of determining the role
of immune response signaling in regulation of cardiac growth and regeneration. The 4 Project Leaders are
cardiovascular biologist, and thus having a strong immunology presence in the network is paramount for its
success, not only to provide technical expertise and reagents, but also to play a crucial consultancy role. Core
B will be led by Dr. James Chen, a renowned immunologist, who will play the critical role of providing technical
and logistic support to Project Leaders in all matters pertaining to immunological studies. This is a critical and
innovative design of the current Program Project as it will allow the 4 Project leaders to seamlessly integrate
complex immunological assays and concepts into their research program. As such, Core B will provide a
number of essential support services including isolation and characterization of immune cells, performing gene
expression analysis studies, providing critical reagents for immunological assays and providing consultation on
study design and interpretation. The immunology goal will serve an invaluable role within the network that will
enhance synergy, and maximize productivity of all Network Projects"
10840879,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current treatment for HIV infection requires strict adherence to daily antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART has
greatly reduced mortality and morbidity but is not a cure. The main barrier to a cure is the pool of latently
infected CD4+ T cells that carry integrated HIV provirus and are capable of reactivating and causing
recrudescence of viremia if ART is stopped. A leading strategy to eliminate this persistent reservoir is termed
“shock and kill” or “kick and kill” and consists of two interventions used with continued ART: first, a latency
reversal agent (LRA) to reactivate latent virus and second, an approach to enhance clearance of infected cells.
In this proposal, we will build upon our preliminary data indicating that activation of the non-canonical (nc) NF-
κB signaling pathway with a mimetic of the second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspases (SMACm)
results in systemic latency reversal in animal models. Using the highly relevant SIV/RM/ART model, we will
answer three important questions regarding the biologic effects of SMACm treatment. First (Aim 1), we will
determine the anatomic and cellular origin of the viremia produced during ART upon treatment with SMACm
and its relationship with rebound viremia after ART interruption. In this study, we will utilize barcoded
SIVmac239M to extensively sequence SIV RNA in sorted CD4+ T cell subsets from blood and tissues in
comparison to plasma virus. We will also apply single cell transcriptomic methodologies to answer this
question. Second (Aim 2), we test a novel “kick and kill” approach that combines latency reversal with SMACm
plus venetoclax, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, that has been shown to cause preferential apoptosis of HIV-
expressing cells. We will determine whether this combined treatment reduces total, intact, and replication
competent reservoirs in memory CD4+ T cells from multiple tissues and/or modulates viral recrudescence after
ART interruption. Third (Aim 3), we will model the immunovirologic factors predictive of virus reactivation on
ART with SMACm treatment and during ART interruption following therapeutic targeting of the ncNF-κB and
BCL-2 pathways. This model will further reveal the potential of this cure approach and inform the design of
future “kick and kill” studies.
This work will allow us to elucidate the full potential of targeting the ncNF-κB pathway for latency reversal and
to evaluate an innovative strategy to reduce virus persistence. We hope these results will contribute to a cure
for HIV infection."

Significance: Nanostructure formation by supramolecular self-assembly primarily involves the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic equilibrium of amphiphiles within aqueous environments. The biocompatibility and
chemical versatility permitted by block copolymer amphiphiles have allowed the fabrication of a wide range of
nanoscale biomaterials (NBMs). Despite these advances, considerable challenges remain. Self-assembled
NBMs experience substantial difficulties with the encapsulation of molecules, with many (often difficult to express
or expensive) proteins and hydrophilic small molecules achieving low encapsulation efficiencies well below 20%.
Furthermore, the multicomponent structure of these amphiphiles often requires employment of complex block
copolymer chemistries, which can present difficulties when scaling up synthesis and purification for practical
clinical testing and translation.
Innovation: A novel means of supramolecular self-assembly that employs a single, simple, water-soluble
homopolymer that achieves >90% encapsulation efficiency universally for multiple hydrophilic (and hydrophobic)
small molecules and biologics simultaneously will be modeled, optimized and validated. The unique network
self-assembly of poly(propylene sulfone) (PPSU) homopolymers, which are simultaneously both soluble and
crystallizable in water, has not been previously reported. By adjusting solvent polarity, intra- and interchain
segments of noncovalent sulfone-sulfone bonds form along the PPSU backbone, biomimetic of DNA
hybridization and leucine zippers in proteins. Preliminary experiments and simulations of this process revealed
dynamic sulfone-sulfone interactions to form an interconnected physical gel network that can solidify into either
macroscale hydrogels or collapse into nanogels of diverse morphologies. Using this rapid and scalable
methodology, uniform populations of diverse nanogel morphologies can be specified, including spheres, vesicles
and filamentous bundles. Importantly, drugs (regardless of their physicochemical properties) are efficiently and
universally captured within PPSU nanogels during network collapse. This novel mechanism of molecular
encapsulation demonstrates an exceptionally high loading efficiency for all molecules tested and combinations
thereof, including proteins, DNA, RNA, fluorophores, contrast agents and small molecule drugs.
Two independent aims are proposed to optimize and validate PPSU NBMs as a novel controlled delivery platform
for biomedical applications. Aim 1: Employ molecular dynamics simulations and analytical nanoscale
microscopy to mechanistically understand PPSU self-assembly and therapeutic loading. Aim 2: Develop
universal molecular encapsulation by PPSU as a tool for the optimization of a model NBM vaccine formulation."

 Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally and poses an enormous public health and economic
burden. In the United States, prevalence and mortality due to heart failure have even increased in recent years,
underscoring the need for a greater understanding of pathophysiological signaling mechanisms that underlie
cardiac maladaptation. The cardiac myocyte is a highly specialized cell-type with a complex and unique
cytoarchitectural landscape. However, mechanisms that topologically orient intracellular signaling events in
cardiomyocytes remain ill-defined. While the roles of phosphorylation in cardiac signal transduction have been
studied for decades, very little is known regarding regulation of signaling by lipid modifications. Palmitoylation
or S-acylation, the reversible attachment of fatty acids onto protein cysteines, is an optimal mechanism to
regulate dynamic association of proteins with signaling complexes that nucleate at intracellular membranes. We
found that protein palmitoylation modulates localized signaling in cardiomyocytes and participates in cardiac
hypertrophy and failure. Specifically, our recent data indicate that palmitoylation of Ras-related C3 botulinum
toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) exerts profound spatiotemporal control of cardiomyocyte Rac1 signaling in vivo. The
small GTPase Rac1 is a critical regulator of pathogenic signaling and oxidative stress in cardiac hypertrophy,
heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmia that functions in part through regulation of the NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2)
complex that regionally generates reactive oxygen species in response to hypertrophic stimulation. Here, we will
exploit regulation of localized Rac1 signaling in cardiomyocytes by palmitoylation to reveal the microscale
intracellular signal transduction landscape in cardiac hypertrophy. This proposal will test the central hypothesis
that palmitoylation of Rac1 targets signaling activity to discrete cardiomyocyte membrane microdomains to elicit
activation of unique effector pathways and pathophysiologic responses. In this application we will manipulate
Rac1 palmitoylation status in vivo in the context of cardiac hypertrophy to achieve the following aims: (1)
determine the role of Rac1 palmitoylation in cardiac hypertrophy, compartmentalization of Nox2 activity, and
oxidative stress and (2) uncover effectors and signaling pathways regulated by palmitoylated versus
depalmitoylated proteoforms of Rac1. We will achieve these aims in part using a novel mouse model with
inducible knock-in mutation of the Rac1 palmitoylation site (Rac1 Cys178Ser). These studies will establish a
paradigm for palmitoylation as a lipidation switch mechanism for spatially encoding cardiomyocyte signal
transduction circuitry and will identify pathogenic microdomain signaling events that may provide more targeted
vantage points for treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure."
10884883,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are significant gaps in our understanding between well-established, evidence-based guidelines for
detection and treatment of glaucoma and effectively applying those guidelines within the high-risk populations
that continue to develop blindness. As outlined by the National Academy of Medicine, great opportunity exists to
incorporate principles of population health and community engagement to close this observed glaucoma
detection gap. The overall objective of this study is to design and implement a faith-based, community health
worker-delivered (CHW) support program for individuals at high risk for glaucoma, specifically Black Americans.
The central hypothesis is that a personalized faith-based support program will result in increased eye care
utilization in Black Americans at high risk for glaucoma who currently underutilize eye care. The rationale is that
increasing appropriate eye care utilization in high-risk individuals and beginning treatment at earlier stages of
the disease will decrease the risk of unpreventable blindness. The candidate will reach the overall objective by
achieving the following 2 specific aims: 1) Use implementation science framework and community-engaged
methods to adapt an existing glaucoma coaching program and develop a multilevel intervention that addresses
the key determinants of successfully increasing eye care utilization in Black Americans; and 2) Implement and
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the Community-Based Treatment for Glaucoma program (ComBaT
Glaucoma), for Black Americans. In Aim 1, the Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD)
implementation science framework will be used to guide semi-structured interviews with community members,
leaders, and local eye care providers to identify barriers and potential facilitators of increasing eye care utilization
in Black Americans; and b) adapt the Support, Educate and Empower (SEE) Program to the needs and culture
of the community to develop and the faith-based CHW-delivered program that uses implementation strategies
and behavior change techniques linked to community-identified determinants for optimal success. In Aim 2, the
ComBaT Glaucoma program will be implemented by conducting a single-arm pilot study with 50 Black
Americans. The candidate will use mixed methods to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the ComBaT
Glaucoma program. This study is significant because it addresses a gap between well-established guidelines for
glaucoma and high-risk individuals that continue to go blind despite these data. It is innovative because it
employs implementation science framework, a community-engaged, faith-based tailored approach to create a
support program to increase eye care utilization in Black Americans at high risk for glaucoma. Dr. Elam will use
the skills acquired during this training award to become one of the few ophthalmologists trained in implementation
science and community-engaged health disparities research to improve glaucoma care for all people in the
United States."

 Mutations of gap junction gene Cx26 (GJB2) cause the most of hereditary deafness, ranging from profound
congenital deafness at birth to mild late-onset hearing loss in childhood. Mouse models show that Cx26
deficiency can induce cochlear developmental disorders, hair cell degeneration, endocochlear potential (EP)
reduction, and active cochlear amplification declining. We further found that the cochlear developmental
disorder rather than hair cell degeneration is a primary cause for congenital deafness, whereas late-onset
hearing loss is associated with reduction of outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility even hair cells have no
connexin expression. We also evidenced that K+-recycling hypothesis is not the deafness mechanism of Cx26
deficiency. However, detailed mechanisms of these pathological changes induced by Cx26 deficiency remain
unclear. Moreover, little is known about pathological changes in the human cochlea. Recently, gene therapy
with viral-expression of Cx26 in the cochlea was failed to restore hearing. The main reason is lack of required
knowledge of Cx26 function in the cochlea and deafness mechanisms by Cx26 deficiency.
 In this proposal, we will continually investigate Cx26 function and cellular and molecular mechanisms of
Cx26 deficiency-induced congenital deafness and late-onset hearing loss. Cx26 deficiency causes the
cochlear developmental disorder, indicating that gap junction (GJ) channels as an intercellular communication
conduit are crucial for the cochlear development. Many factors, such as promoters, transcription factors, and
miRNAs, can regulate gene expressions during development. However, none of these regulators is permeable
to GJ channels except miRNAs. miRNAs can regulate gene expression broadly and have a critical role in the
organ development. Deficiency of miRNAs can cause cochlear developmental disorders. In this study, we will
first test whether Cx26 deficiency can disrupt miRNA expression and intercellular communication in the
cochlea to affect cochlear development in the congenital deafness. Secondly, we will define how Cx26
deficiency decline OHC electromotility leading to late-onset hearing loss, which patients are good candidates
for administration of preventive and therapeutic interventions due to normal hearing in their earlier life.
Recently, connexin non-channel function has been emerged. Besides forming GJ channels, connexins can
participate in cell cytoskeleton formation. We will test whether Cx26 deficiency can impair cytoskeleton
formation in the OHC’s supporting cells, thereby changing OHC-loading (membrane tension) and declining
OHC electromotility and active cochlear amplification. Finally, we will use backward-mutation screening
approach to screen Cx26 mutations in the archival human temporal bones from patients with nonsyndromic
hearing loss, whose pathological changes in the cochlea have been diagnosed, to identify mutation-induced
pathological changes in the human cochlea. Apparently, these studies will reveal detailed deafness
mechanisms by Cx26 deficiency. Such information is urgently required for developing efficient therapies."
10847360,"ABSTRACT Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a leading cause of disability and affects ~1.4 billion
people globally, including different age groups and ethnicities. Although around 150 genes have been identified
for SNHL, the Hispanic population remains understudied for SNHL, with most Hispanic studies focused on a
single gene GJB2. A few countries studied – Chile, Mexico/Hispanic-American, Nicaragua, the Philippines –
have a low prevalence of GJB2 variants, suggesting that SNHL cohorts from these countries have novel genes
or variants for discovery. Additionally, Hispanic children are at risk for environmental exposures to chemicals
that may lead to epigenetic modifications and cause SNHL. Our overarching hypothesis is that SNHL has a
unique, population-specific allelic and epigenetic spectrum in Hispanic-descent populations. We
assembled an international group of researchers with complementary expertise in otology, genetics,
epigenomics and functional genomics, with previous collaborative experience that signals this project will be
highly productive. In our previous studies, we identified novel variants in Hispanic-American and Filipino patients
with SNHL, including genetic variants that were associated with temporal bone anomalies and predictive of
cochlear implant outcomes. Nicaraguan families were submitted for exome sequencing and were negative for
variants; these families likely harbor non-coding variants or have epigenetic mechanisms of SNHL. We have in
place efficient pipelines for the identification of novel SNHL genes in families and differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) in case-control cohorts, as well as validation methods in animal models and epithelial cells. Our goal is
to determine genetic and epigenetic risk factors in Hispanic children with SNHL. For Aim 1, we will identify
SNHL variants from next-generation sequence data using a tiered approach, which includes Sanger sequencing,
filtering, homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis and transmission disequilibrium tests. We will recruit 500
Hispanic families, including large families sufficient for genome-wide significant linkage, and submit DNA
samples to sequencing and analyses. Novel SNHL genes and variants identified in these families will be followed
up with protein localization and hearing studies in mouse and zebrafish models and mutation constructs in
epithelial cells. For Aim 2, we will perform an epigenome-wide association study by profiling the methylome of a
well-powered cohort of 500 SNHL probands and 500 hearing children matched by age, sex and population, in
order to identify DMRs that are associated with SNHL. For the top identified DMRs, we will utilize CRISPR-dCas9
technology on epithelial cells to determine if targeting the methylation site will affect gene expression. Integration
of methylation profiles and genetic data using methylation quantitative trait locus analysis will aid in
understanding genetic vs. environmental contributions to SNHL. Overall this project will impact genetic screening
protocols and genetic counseling particularly in Hispanic populations, as well as improve understanding of the
hearing mechanism and lead to new targets for the development of treatment of SNHL."

Level 2 hypoglycemia (blood glucose <54 mg/dL) is a medical emergency that can lead to confusion, cardiac
arrhythmias, and even death. This dangerous condition occurs frequently in patients with type 1 diabetes
(T1D), including those using continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). In prior studies of patients not
using CGMs, researchers identified patient beliefs that interfere with hypoglycemia treatment. However,
treatment interfering beliefs in CGM users remain to be evaluated, and an intervention to impactfully address
these beliefs among CGM users is needed. The goal of this project is to comprehensively evaluate beliefs that
interfere with hypoglycemia treatment in adult T1D CGM users, and to develop a novel behavioral intervention
program to address these beliefs and minimize hypoglycemia. Mixed methods techniques can guide
identification of hypoglycemia treatment interfering beliefs, and determine those predictive of level 2
hypoglycemia for targeted intervention development. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can be linked to
CGM data to develop widely accessible, patient-centered, real-time interventions to address treatment
interfering beliefs. Central hypothesis: An mHealth-CGM behavioral intervention program can mitigate beliefs
that interfere with hypoglycemia treatment and reduce hypoglycemia in T1D CGM users. Aims: (1) Acquire an
in-depth understanding of CGM users’ beliefs that interfere with hypoglycemia treatment; (2) Develop
an mHealth text messaging program that generates automated, real-time behavioral interventions to mitigate
beliefs that interfere with hypoglycemia treatment; (3) Assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary

goal of becoming an independent investigator, identifying and developing interventions to mitigate barriers to
hypoglycemia management and prevention in diabetes patients. He has a successful history of designing and
conducting hypoglycemia survey studies and biomedical clinical trials, but needs more training in advanced

10845494,"Project Summary
Within a cell, though the sequence of the genome is essentially ﬁxed, its state is constantly changing. Two aspects
of this changing state at a given point in time are the speciﬁc arrangement of myriad protein complexes along the
genome in the form of chromatin, and the rate of transcript production for each gene. Each of these inﬂuences
the other, and each also changes in response to the cell's internal or external environment, setting up a complex
dynamical system that undergirds cellular function and adaptation. A fundamental research objective is to
understand the dynamic relationship between these two, genome-wide: how transcription is inﬂuenced by the
chromatin landscape, and how the chromatin landscape is inﬂuenced by transcription.
A central goal of our research group is to develop models capable of predicting a cell's genome-wide transcription
state from knowledge of its genome-wide chromatin state. To build such models requires simultaneously proﬁling
a cell's genome-wide chromatin and transcription states at different times and under different conditions:
Observing how the two change together as they respond to a changing environment, particularly in the context
of directed perturbation, provides the statistical leverage needed to build predictive models capable of providing
causal and mechanistic interpretations. Our models will initially be developed and validated by monitoring
dynamic chromatin occupancy and transcription in budding yeast under various conditions: as they progress
through the cell cycle (a temporal series of highly regulated events controlling cell proliferation, aberrations of
which can lead to cancer), in response to environmental stresses, and across genetic strains, including mutants
that disrupt chromatin remodeling or TF expression. We also have access to massive amounts of data assaying the
dynamics of transcription and chromatin in the context of human hormone response and chromatin remodeling.
The distinct yeast and human contexts offer an opportunity to develop methods that are broadly applicable
across this spectrum and provide mechanistic insight into foundational questions in genomic regulation.
The proposed research will produce computational and statistical methods based on Bayesian probabilistic
graphical modeling approaches that can (1) more accurately, comprehensively, and scalably proﬁle both chromatin
occupancy and transcriptional regulation as they change over time, and (2) infer mechanistic links between the
two that elucidate how the cell dynamically regulates its genome-wide transcription program and chromatin
organization in response to changing conditions.
More generally, as advanced experimental technologies and assays continue to be pioneered at a rapid pace, we
need to concomitantly develop sophisticated new computational and statistical methods, not merely to store
or process the ever-growing amounts of data, but to formulate models that provide mechanistically grounded
explanations of the data, to develop algorithms that use the data more effectively to reveal deeper biological
insight, and to make causal predictions that can be experimentally tested to advance our scientiﬁc understanding."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is
increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to
vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the
predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to
cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively
implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal
disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been
considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the
main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been
increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal
neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or
ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood,
and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal
neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM.
DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal
disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in
retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she
proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of
DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR
or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and
DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications
and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational
research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate
pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her
research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the
largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an
independent clinician-scientist."

 Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of non-genetic neurodevelopmental
disability worldwide. Clinical symptoms of FASD can vary, but include facial dysmorphology, cognitive deficits
and behavioral abnormalities. The variable clinical presentation of FASD makes diagnosis a challenge. Delayed
diagnosis is associated with negative clinical outcomes, while early intervention can improve patients’ quality of
life.
 Deficits in gross and fine motor development are some of the earliest identifiable clinical signs of FASD in
patients. However, the mechanism by which prenatal alcohol exposure contributes to deficits in early motor skills
is not yet known. Functional maturation of neurons within the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is
closely associated with onset of complex movements in neonatal mice. The experiments outlined in this F30
proposal will investigate how aberrant development of GABAergic interneuron circuitry within the striatum may
relate to developmental motor delays after prenatal alcohol exposure. My preliminary data suggest that prenatal
alcohol exposure results in deficient formation of synaptic connections to striatal GABAergic interneurons during
the first two postnatal weeks. Specific Aim 1 will leverage whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, optogenetic
and trans-synaptic viral approaches to identify the source of deficits in the formation of functional synaptic
afferents to striatal GABAergic interneurons. Specific Aim 2 will establish how observed prenatal alcohol
exposure-induced deficits in striatal GABAergic interneuron signaling may relate to altered morphological and
functional maturation of striatal projection neurons, and neonatal motor development as measured by a series
of brief behavioral tasks assessing the onset of gross, fine, and complex motor abilities during the first two
postnatal weeks.
 This F30 proposal will allow me to fulfill my long-term objective of contributing to a better understanding of
the physiological changes underlying the earliest clinical symptoms of FASD in order to improve efforts to identify
FASD patients and provide targeted treatment. My goals in completing the proposed work are to develop the
intellectual foundations and technical skills necessary to conduct research as physician scientist in the FASD
field, with a focus on how prenatal alcohol exposure can affect the development of neural circuits and result in
changes in early behaviors."
10843734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Post-treatment relapse is one of the most unpredictable limitations of orthodontic therapy. Relapse results in
patient's teeth reverting towards their pretreatment positions, which increases the susceptibility to functional
problems, dental disease, and substantially increases the financial burden for retreatment. Currently, patient
compliance-based retention is the primary method for maintaining post-orthodontic tooth stability, which due to
its variable use results in a significant proportion of patients experiencing relapse. Therefore, the objective of
this application is to address the clinical need for a translational and clinically relevant approach to increase
post-orthodontic tooth stability using approaches that minimize the need for patient compliance. Orthodontic
relapse is strongly associated with increased bone-resorbing osteoclast activity and immature bone quality
surrounding the teeth. As such, a promising approach to this adverse outcome is to produce a response of net
bone accretion by synergistically inducing osteogenesis and inhibiting osteoclastic activity. However, a strategy
to produce such synergistic responses in bone has never been explored for this purpose. Our group has found
that multiple and single submucosal injections of anti-osteoclastic recombinant OPG protein (OPG-Fc) reduced
relapse by 60-70% in a rat model of orthodontic relapse. These biological methods have not been adopted for
clinical use presumably due to the lack of effective drug delivery systems that mitigate the need for large bolus
doses over long durations that may produce systemic effects. This application aims to develop a clinically
relevant osteoconductive hydroxyapatite (HAP)-based drug delivery system for local and sustained release of
OPG to mitigate post-orthodontic relapse that will also enhance our understanding of bone
regeneration/maturation following mechanically mediated bone turnover through modulation of these
responses by HAP and OPG.
This project will test the central hypothesis that sustained release of recombinant OPG from hollow
hydroxyapatite (HHAP) microparticles will inhibit orthodontic relapse by decreasing osteolysis and promoting
bone anabolism. Aim 1 will build on our preliminary data to engineer HHAP microparticles for sustained release
of OPG at desired concentrations and validate this system in vitro with OPG and osteoclast activity assays. Aim
2 will validate the use of OPG administered for local and sustained release via HHAP drug delivery microparticles
to mitigate relapse in our animal model of orthodontic relapse with minimal systemic effects. Furthermore, this
study will characterize potential molecular pathways by which the periodontal tissues and cellular responses
result in enhancing bone regeneration and maturation. The successful completion of this project will lead to a
translatable method to improve post-orthodontic tooth stability outcomes and provide significant insight into
enhancing bone regeneration/maturation following mechanically mediated bone turnover."
10819506,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prenatal period is regarded as one of the most sensitive phases in human development. Events that occur
during gestation can alter the course of development with lasting impact. Presently, the COVID-19 pandemic is
exerting wide-spread impact on the lives of expectant mothers around the world. Particularly salient pandemic-
related stressors that are being experienced by pregnant women are social isolation and uncertainty stress.
There is ample physiological and behavioral literature showing that social isolation and uncertainty stress affect
typical human and animal psychobiological functioning, but there is an absence of knowledge about how these
conditions might impact the physical and psychological health of a pregnant woman, and what the
consequences of those changes might be for her developing child. The central objective of this proposal is to
build foundational knowledge about the effects of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal
psychobiology and infant neurobehavior. We will explore several candidate physiological systems in the
mother to elucidate mechanisms that underlie associations between maternal stressors and child outcomes.
To achieve these goals, we will recruit 200 women from a large New York City cohort established at the height
of the pandemic into a prospective, longitudinal study that will include pre- and postnatal biospecimen
collection and child neurobehavioral assessments at 6-, 12- and 24 months. Multi-modal neuroimaging
strategies, including infant EEG and quantitative MRI, and innovative remote biophysical data collection
strategies will be employed. The primary aims of this project are to (i) examine the impact of prenatal social
isolation and uncertainty stress on maternal biology and postnatal mental health; (ii) evaluate the influence of
maternal prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on infant neurobehavioral development; and (iii)
examine the role of prenatal social isolation and uncertainty stress on mother-infant bi-directional interactions.
We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate whether, and how, prenatal social isolation and uncertainty
stress modify maternal biology and affect, and the neurobehavioral consequences of those impacts on infants.
Such work would constitute a substantial advance in our understanding of the longitudinal effects of prenatal
psychosocial stress exposures, the underlying mechanistic pathways, and the origins of child neurobehavioral
disorders."

In the nematode C. elegans as in other animals, sickness is associated with reduced movement, reduced
feeding, and increased sleep. Sickness behavior in worms is induced by environmental stressors including
heat shock, ultraviolet light, and infection. This behavioral program during sickness is regulated by worm
central neurons that are activated by the cytokine epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF causes reduced activity
in worms, flies, fish, and mice, but the mechanisms of EGF activation itself during sickness are not clear. We
will use C. elegans to study the mechanism of EGF regulation during sickness. In Aim 1, we will determine
where (from which cells) and when EGF is released to promote sickness behavior. To identify other regulators
of EGF activation, in Aim 2, we will perform genome-wide discovery screens for genes required for sickness
behavior. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that sickness behavior supports survival during sickness. A long-
term goal of these studies is to identify candidate signaling molecules for developing diagnostics and
treatments of sleepiness during sickness and to understand the importance of sleep in promoting recovery
from illness."
10833053,"With over 100,000 patients now on the waiting list for a kidney transplant, it is obvious that there is a critical
shortage of available donor organs. Xenotransplantation represents a promising solution. While pigs are
viewed as the optimal non-human source of organs, the potency of the human immune response to pig organs
has prevented the clinical application of pig-to-human kidney transplantation. In this application we propose
using cutting-edge genetic engineering approaches in combination with novel, clinically relevant immune-
suppressants to reduce both the humoral and cellular immune response of nonhuman primates undergoing
kidney xenotransplantation as a preclinical model to inform future human trials. With recent advances in
genome editing techniques we and others have created novel pig donors with multiple genetic alterations and
resultant improvements in xenograft survival. In addition, we have developed and applied strategies to avoid
early antibody mediated rejection by using a pre-transplant antibody screen similar to the crossmatch used in
clinical transplantation. We further identified CD4+ T cells as a critical subset in xenograft rejection and
demonstrated consistent long-term survival in the pig-to-primate kidney transplant model. These results
represent a major advance on the road to clinical translation of xenotransplantation. Here we propose to study
three major barriers to the clinical translation of xenotransplantation: (1) All long-term xenograft survival has
been dependent on antibody blockade of the CD40-CD154 pathway and there is currently no clinically
approved reagent. We will evaluate the only two clinically relevant CD40-CD154 pathway antagonists that are
in development and have shown efficacy in human patients: a) Iscalimab, a novel anti-CD40 antibody and b)
VIB4920, an innovative CD154-targeting protein. Neither of these new reagents has been tested in
xenotransplantation previously. (2) We will determine the impact of two novel desensitization treatments as
well as transient complement inhibition on early antibody mediated rejection. We will test imlifidase (IdeS, an
IgG degrading enzyme recently approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of antibody mediated
rejection) as well as an innovative desensitization strategy combining costimulation blockade and proteasome
inhibition. In addition to addressing early antibody mediated injury we will test a novel complement-directed
therapy, tesidolumab, an anti-C5 antibody that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. We present
exciting data using the novel anti-C5 antibody tesidolumab, suggesting that targeted complement inhibition
mitigates early antibody rejection. (3) Lastly we will address the important issue of late antibody mediated
injury. Given our success we are uniquely positioned to study this important problem. Similar to clinical kidney
transplantation, we have new data that late kidney xenograft injury is directly related to the development of
anti-SLA class II antibody. We will test the importance of this finding by deleting the genes for SLA class II DQ
and DR in the porcine donor tissue and assessing the impact on rejection and protective immunity."

10854836,"SUMMARY
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that underlies heart attacks and stroke. The disease
preferentially occurs in arterial regions exposed to disturbed blood flow (d-flow), in part by altering expression of
flow-sensitive genes. While looking for flow-sensitive long non-coding RNAs, we identified the flow-sensitive
heart of glass (HEG1) gene as a potential target. Previous studies using HEG1 knockouts in zebra fish and mice
have demonstrated its critical role in cardiovascular development and vascular integrity, but its role and
mechanisms of action in vascular biology and atherosclerosis are far from clear. Recently, we generated exciting
preliminary data, including a single-cell RNAseq study using the mouse partial carotid ligation (PCL) model,
demonstrating that HEG1 expression is increased by stable flow (s-flow) and decreased under disturbed flow (d-
flow) conditions. HEG1 knockdown in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) induces inflammation, barrier
dysfunction, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), key pro-atherogenic processes. HEG1 has a long
N-terminal extracellular structure containing two highly glycosylated (Gly) domains (potential flow sensing
domain), three EGF-like (EGFL) domains containing highly conserved Cys clusters (potential redox-sensitive,
flow-sensing domain),a transmembrane (TM) domain, and the cytosolic C-terminal (C-term signal transduction)
domain. Our preliminary results show that HEG1 1) can be pulled with a HEG1 antibody or sheared to induce
Ca++ flux, and 2) is redox-sensitive in a Poldip2-dependent manner. Based on these exciting data, we
hypothesize that HEG1 protein is a redox-sensitive mechanosensor, mediating the atheroprotective effects of
stable flow, while HEG1 loss and malfunction by d-flow induces endothelial dysfunction leading to
atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of HEG1 in flow-
dependent EC function (inflammation, EndMT, and permeability) using siRNA-mediated knockdown or
overexpression of HEG1 (using AAV-HEG1 expressing WT or 3 truncation mutants ΔGly, ΔEGFL or ΔTM+C-
term) in HAECs and immortalized mouse aortic ECs (iMAECs). EC-targeted HEG1-null mice (HEG1-EC-/-) will
be used without or with the AAV-HEG1 constructs for in vivo validation of EC function. Aim 2 will test if HEG1 is
a redox-sensitive mechanosensor by focusing on immediate changes (seconds) in intracellular calcium, acute
activation (seconds-minutes) of signaling proteins, and slow (>hours) cell changes in response to shear stress
or tensional force using magnetic beads coated with HEG1 mAb. For these studies, HAECs and iMAECs treated
with siHEG1 or the same AAV9-HEG1 constructs described in Aim 1 will be used. Aim 3 will determine the role
of HEG1 in atherosclerosis using HEG1-EC-/- mice injected with AAV-PCSK9. We will further test if transduction
with the AAV-HEG1 constructs can prevent atherosclerosis in HEG1-EC-/- mice. These studies will define if
HEG1 mediates the atheroprotective effects of stable flow by serving as a redox-sensitive mechanosensor and
may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is one of the primary reasons for
memory dysfunction and dementia after 60 years of age. Neuronal dysfunction and death in the frontal cortex
and hippocampus, along with glia-mediated neuroinflammation and formation of aberrant protein aggregates
and fibrils are hallmarks of AD. Sporadic and familial forms of AD have an overproduction and/or decreased
clearance of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides and intraneuronal tangles of twisted tau protein fibers.
Neuroinflammation is known to occur in AD, and when associated near Aβ plaques there is a greater
neurodegeneration. Furthermore, peripheral immune activity and inflammation can affect inflammation in the
CNS. T regulatory cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells that have inherent anti-inflammatory and
immunomodulatory properties. Tregs are found in the CNS under steady state conditions and increase trafficking
to regions of CNS inflammation. Less active or decreased numbers of Tregs has been found in AD patients and
depletion of Tregs can accelerate cognitive defects in murine AD models. We hypothesize that Tregs expressing
chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with specificity to amyloid-beta (Aβ) will have immunomodulatory activity and
improve cognitive function of the 5xFAD B6 mice, a murine AD model. The aim of this proposal is to test the
innovative concept that Tregs engineered to express CARs against amyloid-beta will demonstrate
immunomodulatory effects in the CNS and in the peripheral tissues resulting in improved cognitive behavior. The
data generated will provide key proof-of-concept data to develop this novel therapeutic idea forward."

Transposable elements have generated the majority of the sequence in the human genome, and all of human
biology has evolved in the ever-present DNA, RNA, and protein made by these self-replicating pieces of
selfish DNA. The replication of transposable elements constitutes a major source of new mutations in humans
which drive genome instability and a variety of genetic diseases. Our group previously discovered the rapid
evolution of several restriction factors of Long Interspersed Element-1 (L1), the endogenous retroelements most
active in humans. This pattern of evolution suggests that L1s have evolved to evade these restriction factors,
driving rapid host evolution to keep pace. However, it is unknown how sequence variation in L1s impacts
their ability to evade and replicate in the presence of host restriction factors.
We are specifically interested in understanding – have transposable elements evolved to evade the defense
mechanisms of the human genome? What are the mechanisms of transposable element evasion? What are the
consequences to human health of evasive transposable elements replicating at times and places they are
normally repressed? To answer these questions, our lab employs non-traditional combinations of approaches
including retrospective analyses of genomes to understand what has happened and prospective experiments to
ask what could happen. We propose to leverage the lab’s recently generated, diverse panel of more than 130
young human L1s to search for variation in the ability of L1s to replicate in the presence of otherwise effective
host restriction factors. This variation could indicate adaptation of an L1 to evade host restriction or adaptation
of the host to restrict evasive L1s. In addition to this retrospective analysis of evolutionary history, we propose to
‘speed up’ evolution by building an in vitro evolution system to select for L1s that evade a defined restriction
factor. Comparison of these historical and prospective evolutionary approaches will help us decode the
selective pressures that drove L1 and human evolution. This research will address a fascinating basic
science question about the mechanisms of L1 evolution in the face of the host innate immune system with impact
on our understanding of sporadic autoimmune diseases without a clear genetic contribution.
Our lab combines a dedication to mentorship and scientific outreach with effort to build a communicative
and accommodating space to enable creative, daring science. Our diverse and experienced team of scientists
integrates expertise in comparative genomics, genome evolution, L1 biology, in vitro evolution, and protein
evolution and function to bring an evolution-driven approach to the proposed projects. With our record of pushing
conceptual and technical boundaries to bring new understanding to the fields of protein evolution and
restriction factor biology, our team is uniquely poised to bring about a new understanding of L1 evolution and
biology with implications for genome evolution and numerous disease states with clear L1 involvement. (30 lines)"

The FAVOR T32 titled “Filling a Void of Research Training for Transplant Surgeons” will prepare surgical
residents for translational research careers in abdominal and thoracic transplant surgery. This program will
train and inspire a unique cadre of surgeon-scientists to translate astute observations at the bedside, in the
operating room, and in the clinic into novel hypotheses that can be interrogated through immunology-focused
translational research. This program is uniquely focused, serving a growing need to train the next generation of
transplant surgeon-scientists that can contribute to the burgeoning field of translational and personalized
medicine. FAVOR is structured to reverse the dismal trend resulting in only 1.8% of ASTS trained surgical
fellows successfully competing for NIH-K series awards, despite 76% being motivated to spend more time in
research (Englesbe et al., AJT 2010:10, 191-193; Kirk & Feng, AJT 2011, 11; 191-193). The training includes
core courses in Designing Clinical Research, Statistical Computing and Database Management in Clinical
Research, Scientific Writing, and Biostatistical Methods for Clinical Research. The FAVOR T32 also includes
specialized training electives, which will be tailored to each trainee based on long-term goals and interests. A
small cadre of surgical trainees from within UCSF, all training grant eligible and highly diverse (~40% URM,
50% female), will be selected for FAVOR. We will also invite trainees from other academic institutions by
competitive application for training slots, where trainees will dedicate two full-time years, without significant
clinical responsibilities, towards research education and training. One trainee slot/year will also be eligible to
enroll in a 1-2 year degree course in Clinical/Translational Medicine. Trainees will be prepared to apply their
training to deepen understanding of the immune system, as well as developing new, immune-based
diagnostics, prognostics, therapeutics and clinical approaches that are relevant to surgical procedures and
outcomes. While in the program they will also learn how to develop and draw upon clinical databases that
integrate surgical outcomes with data from pathology and immunology. FAVOR's NIH-funded faculty, with
distinguished track records in immunology and translational research, have been specially selected to inspire
and guide trainees in translational mentored research, with selection of 2 mentors/trainee from each of the
clinical and scientific mentor pools. Post-training career advice and guidance will facilitate placement into
prestigious fellowships and academic faculty positions for FAVOR trainees. The national impact of the FAVOR
program will be realized through the scientific maturation of a trainee group with comprehensive clinical
expertise and outstanding translational science, with the ability to apply translational immunology to benefit
organ transplant recipients."

 As animals transition from relying on their mother’s milk to foraging and consuming foods, they experience
a large variety of new tastants. These experiences regulate their taste preferences later in life through a process
that likely relies on plasticity in neural circuits associated with taste and feeding. The gustatory cortex (GC) is
involved in processing taste information. It is required for taste-motivated behaviors and for learning about the
chemosensory and affective dimensions of gustatory stimuli. The effects of early experiences with tastants on
the development of taste preferences or the maturation of GC circuits has not been investigated.
 Our previous work in a different sensory cortex demonstrated a central role for inhibitory neurons in
experience-dependent plasticity and postnatal circuit refinement. In this proposal, we will take advantage of our
previous work and set out to investigate how the maturation of inhibition in GC contributes to the expression of
taste preferences.
 The first part of the proposal will determine how taste preferences mature over the course of postnatal
development and assess the role of experience with tastants on the modulation of taste preferences. Our
preliminary observations suggest that there is a sensitive period for the experience-dependent modulation of
taste preferences that is restricted to the weeks between the time weaning and young adulthood.
 We will also assess the time course of maturation of inhibitory circuits in GC and their sensitivity to
experience with tastants. Finally, we will assess the relationship between the maturation of inhibition and the
development of taste preferences using a variety of approaches including enzymatic and chemogenetic
manipulations of inhibitory circuits’ maturation.
 These studies will determine the role of inhibitory circuit in GC in the behavioral expression of taste
preferences. While mechanisms underlying learning about the value or physical cues associated with tastes has
been investigated in adulthood, the mechanisms leading to such a refined circuit in postnatal development have
not been described. The results of these studies will indicate the role of early food experiences in determining
taste-based choices throughout life."

Neurulation is a crucial stage in human development when the nervous system is patterned, and the neural tube
is shaped. A large fraction of severe birth defects as well as post-implantation spontaneous abortions occur at
this stage. Despite its importance, this stage of human development is almost completely inaccessible as IVF
embryos cannot be cultured until this point, and recovery of tissue samples from these early stages is rare. Even
if such methods were possible, they present ethical dilemmas. A powerful emerging alternative is to create self-
organizing models of these events starting from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We have created a two-
dimensional system that mimics the early patterning of the ectodermal medial-lateral axis and is ideal for studying
self-organization of ectodermal fates which include the nervous system, skin, neural crest, and sensory organs.
We have also built upon this system to create a controlled three-dimensional system that undergoes reproducible
morphogenesis reminiscent of neural tube closure. Here we propose to refine these models, as well as to create
new models of the anterior-posterior axis, and to use these models together with live cell reporters to probe the
interplay between morphogen signaling through the Wnt, BMP, and FGF pathways, patterning along the anterior-
posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) axes, and neural tube morphogenesis. We will address key questions
about how spatial patterns of morphogen signals are organized and how they are interpreted by cells to give rise
to patterns of fates and the physical movements that shape tissues. Taken together, these experiments will
provide insight into ectodermal patterning and morphogenesis and establish a system for studying birth defects
associated with this stage of development."

This collaborative grant application proposes (a) to conduct a multicenter single-arm pivotal clinical trial of the
Jarvik 2015 left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge-to-transplant in 22 hospitalized children with severe
heart failure (HF) refractory to medical therapy; and (b) to generate the safety and effectiveness data necessary
to support regulatory review and potential FDA approval of the Jarvik 2015 LVAD under the Humanitarian Device
Exemption (HDE) pathway. The HDE pathway is FDA’s approval process for high-risk medical devices intended
to treat rare and/or orphan diseases.
The need for safe, reliable, and dischargeable LVADs for smaller children with HF is well-established. Currently,
the Berlin Heart EXCOR Pediatric VADis the only FDA-approved durable VAD for smaller children. While
outcomes have improved, the Berlin Heart has important limitations: (1) patients cannot be discharged on VAD
support (2) the paracorporeal design, with large-bore cannulae traversing the abdominal wall, results in a high
incidence of wound complications; and (3) the high pump thrombogenicity (especially around the valves) requires
intravenous anticoagulants and intermittent pump exchanges to preempt the risk of stroke. There is an enormous
technology gap between contemporary adult VADs (continuous flow [CF], magnetically-levitated, and safely
dischargeable) and contemporary pediatric VADs (pulsatile, pneumatically driven, non-dischargeable). In recent
years, the Jarvik 2015 LVAD, a fully implantable CF device has emerged as an alternative to the Berlin Heart.
Data from the FDA’s Early Feasibility Study (EFS) suggest the Jarvik 2015 LVAD can support smaller children
successfully for up to a year or longer as a bridge to transplant. However, systematic data in a 22-subject
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) pivotal trial is required for FDA review and approval. The safety endpoint
is freedom from device-related stroke. The effectiveness endpoint is survival to transplant or 180 days in the
absence of severe stroke. The IDE received conditional FDA approval on June 4, 2021 (IDE# G160185).
The trial will be conducted at 14 centers in the US and Europe with a Clinical Coordinating Center at Stanford
University and a Data Coordinating Center at HealthCore, Inc. The investigator group has a strong history of
collaborative research and multicenter clinical trials, facilitating smooth execution of the proposed study. In
accordance with FDA’s requirements for approval of humanitarian devices, a pre-specified performance goal will
demonstrate safety and effectiveness (≥17 of 22 subjects free of stroke, and ≥17 subjects surviving to transplant
or 180 days free of severe stroke: with central review of clinical events and neuroimaging studies.
While safe, reliable, and dischargeable LVADs are widely available for adults, pediatric VAD technology lags
behind by multiple generations of technology. Moreover, children who safely survive their VAD course have a
substantially longer potential life expectancy making evaluation of newer pediatric VADs an urgent priority for
the heart failure community. This trial has the potential to take a crucial step in achieving that goal."
10812470,"Applying ethical standards and norms to research both improves its quality and advances the research, in
addition to protecting the rights of research participants. Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and
North Africa suffer from a low level or non-existent availability of training in research ethics despite a growing
research profile and level of activities in most of these countries. Our program, The Research Ethics Education
Program in Jordan, was able in the past 5-year cycle to make an impressive impact on addressing this lack of
training by achieving its proposed goals and more. There were 118 faculty and researchers trained during this
period in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) from across 25 institutions in 12 different countries in
the region. Those who graduated are strongly committed to continue their career in this field. In addition, more
than 2,175 other graduate students, researchers, and faculty across the MENA region received training in RCR
by our fellows and instructors through 45 different workshops during this period. Fellows have also led the
publication of 40 peer-reviewed papers. In at least five academic institutions fellows are leading the
establishment of ethics committees for the first time, and many are now members or leading existing ethics
committees. We also achieved a three-fold higher representation of women among our fellows than currently
found in academia in Jordan and many of the MENA countries, with 4 of our female fellows assuming
administrative academic positions as deans and one as department chair. Our goal is to continue these
achievements and take this program to the next level by establishing the first Master of Bioethics for the MENA
which would be provided locally by the host research-intensive University, the Jordan University of Science
and Technology (JUST). JUST will also establish a comprehensive Center for Research Ethics that will carry
on the program’s training at multiple levels and offer certification and workshops in RCR. Arabic language
certification in RCR will also be made available to universities in the MENA. If funded for renewal we will be
able to transition the activities of the current program from the US-based-institution to the LMIC-based
institution represented by JUST. Both the master’s, the proposed center, and the Arabic language RCR
certification will provide vital capacity building in the region. It is being offered by a local university to graduate
highly qualified trainees ready to lead the region in bioethics and responsible conduct of research, and expand
the breadth of RCR training at the individual and institutional levels in the MENA. We have created a paradigm
shift in the social norms associated with research and research ethics among our fellows, and at JUST. In this
next phase we will expand on our success by adding more in-depth training offered through the Master of
Bioethics and increase the breadth of dissemination of our activities through a greater number of MENA
research and academic institutions."

 Currently, most nanotechnology cancer therapies focus on the treatment of primary tumors, but it is important
to leverage the potential of nanomedicine to combat cancer spread at each stage of the metastatic process.
Lung metastasis is a highly aggressive, complex, and heterogeneous disease. There is no effective treatment
for metastatic lung tumors and chemotherapy is the only option to prolong patients’ clinical prognosis. Alternative
strategies, including targeted therapy and immunotherapy have been proposed, but they failed to successfully
treat metastatic lesions.
There is an urgent need to accelerate progress toward curing lung metastases and
reduce patients’ mortality. Our goal is to develop a new therapeutic approach that carries more drugs to the
metastatic lung tumors and retains on-site to release a broad-spectrum antitumor medication. In this project, we
propose to use peptide-based nanofiber (pNFP6) with preferential lung-targeting properties to overcome the
barrier of selective drug delivery to metastases. The pNFP6 is innovative as multiple nanofibers can rearrange
into a large interfibril network to prolong the local retention and offer a long-term treatment. The nanofiber
technology will be combined with ionizing radiation therapy to enhance the drug post-delivery antitumor efficacy.
Our central hypothesis is that the combinatorial therapy will cooperatively and synergistically inhibit the disease
progression leading to an effective treatment of lung metastases. For proof-of-principle studies, we will use
pNFP6 to carry and deliver doxorobucin (Dox), a standard cytotoxic agent and radiosensitizer. The nanofibers
will favor the drug accumulation and retention on-site while radiotherapy will promote the overall anticancer effect
through direct tumor cell killing and radiation-mediated immunogenicity. The spatiotemporal-controlled drug
release will be essential to ensure the therapeutic success. To establish the potential of this antimetastatic
multiplexed approach, two specific aims will be pursued: (1) evaluate the local drug release and its impact on
the therapeutic efficacy; and (2) define the therapeutic and survival benefit of Dox-pNFP6 when combined with
radiation therapy. To achieve Aim 1, we will synthesize a panel of Dox-loaded pNFP6 analogues using different
cleavable linkers sensitive to tumor microenvironment stimuli to release the drug. We will study the in vivo drug
delivery, release, and tumoral uptake using Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy and MALDI-imaging. and
identify the optimal release mechanisms in response to metastatic lung tumors. To complete Aim 2, we will
assess the therapeutic efficacy (tumor inhibition and survival benefit) and toxicity profile of Dox-pNFP6 combined
with radiation therapy in several animal models bearing metastatic lung tumors. The treatment outcomes will be
compared to free Dox and Doxil, the FDA-approved liposomal formulation of Dox. We will also investigate the
molecular and immune pathways activated by this new therapeutic strategy to better understand the mechanisms
responsible for the enhanced anticancer activity. Successful completion of this project will provide an effective
therapeutic solution with clinical impacts on the treatment and management of lung metastases."
10839430,"This project addresses the mechanisms of the gut-brain axis by which animals interact with bacterial
pathogens and their microbiota. The focus is on mechanisms by which the nervous system detects the
presence of distinct microbes, and communicates with the intestinal epithelium to elicit host defense
responses. Also of interest is how the intestinal epithelium communicates back with the nervous system to
modulate host physiology and behavior. Over the past ten years, our research program has used C. elegans
as a whole-animal, in vivo model. The advantages of C. elegans include its relative anatomical simplicity and
conserved signaling mechanisms, which enable sophisticated in vivo approaches to dissect inter-organ
communication during infection. In this period, we have made fundamental discoveries including the outsized
roles of TFEB-related transcription factors, acetylcholine-WNT brain-gut signaling, and pathogen-induced
neurodegeneration (PaIN), all of which are conserved in mammals. Thus, our prior research has contributed
to the fundamental understanding of host-microbe interactions and opened new avenues of research. The
present project builds on our prior success and on our new insights into the involvement of sensory neurons
and neurodegeneration in the host-microbe interaction. The goals for the next five years are to elucidate the
neuronal mechanisms of microbial sensing in complex environments, understand the mechanisms of PaIN,
and elucidate the mechanisms of regulation of intestinal host defense genes via TFEB-related transcription
factors by the nervous system, in vivo. Longer term, the overall vision is to produce a comprehensive
understanding of organismal, cellular, and molecular events that take place during initiation and resolution of
infection by pathogens and pathobionts in C. elegans, and to capitalize on the present and future success of
this project by continuing to translate our fundamental findings to murine and human model systems of
infection and inflammation. Because of its focus on the gut-brain axis and the evolutionary conservation of the
mechanisms that we have uncovered, the project is relevant to a broad range of human diseases and
conditions, including infections, immune-mediated diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic
syndrome, and cancer. We anticipate that the knowledge gained from the proposed work will advance the
field and be generally applicable to higher organisms, and thus inform the search for better therapeutics and
diagnostics for human infections and inflammation."

ABSTRACT
Ribosomes are a central hub for controlling gene expression. They not only synthesize proteins, but also regulate
bacterial stress responses, human neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Understanding how ribosomes
control gene expression requires high-resolution structural and accurate biochemical characterization of
ribosome dynamics and interactions, both in vitro and in complex cellular environments. We are uniquely
positioned to address these key challenges by investigating the following questions:
 How do ribosomes regulate bacterial stress responses? In bacteria, ribosomes sense cellular stress via
several pathways, which control the transcriptional adaptation to stress. The direct and indirect pathways that
couple translation with transcription are promising antibiotic targets. We will dissect the structural and cellular
mechanisms of using novel biochemical approaches and ensemble cryo-EM.
 How do ribosomes sense functional and dysfunctional mRNAs? Translation is a major pathway for
sensing problematic mRNAs in eukaryotes, and dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms leads to disease.
To determine how the ribosome recognizes dysfunctional mRNAs with premature nonsense codons, we will use
cellular, biochemical and structural (time-resolved cryo-EM) methods to visualize ribosome interactions with
problematic mRNAs.
 How does translation regulate neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity and contribute to neurological
disorders? Translation regulation in neurons is essential for neurodevelopment, memory consolidation, and
learning, whereas translation dysregulation drives neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
The synaptic proteome—far from the nucleus—is controlled by local translation and requires brain-specific
translation factors and auxiliary proteins. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuronal translation
regulation, we will use genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches, including cellular EM at Ångström-level
detail in functional neurons."
10857162,"The dystonias overall are a rare neurologic disorder. Cervical dystonia (CD), sometimes called
“spasmodic torticollis”, is one of the most common forms of dystonia. CD is characterized by the partial
loss of voluntary control of the neck musculature producing abnormal postures and/or movements of
the head in the form of head tremor. In addition to these overt motor abnormalities, the disorder is also
associated with non-motor symptoms including pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Treatment
options for CD are suboptimal. Many oral medications have been tried but their efficacy is minimal and
limited by dose-dependent adverse side effects. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections repeated every
3-4 months are the primary treatment of choice. Although BoNT is highly efficacious for many patients,
for a variety of reasons about 1/3 of patients discontinue BoNT treatment, and of those who continue
treatment about 1/3 are unsatisfied with the response.
 Because treatment options are suboptimal, there is an active effort to find better strategies for
treating CD, as evidenced by dozens of active trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. However, the most
common clinical outcome assessment used to measure motor abnormalities – the Toronto Western
Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) – does not capture head tremor. Also, as with most
clinical rating scales, the TWSTRS is an intrinsically subjective assessment and therefore suffers from
inter-rater variability. This reduces our power to detect treatment effects in clinical trials.
 Technology-based objective measures have the potential to circumvent this variability.
Advances in computer vision technology have enabled the measurement of head orientation/rotation
from 2-D images of the face in conventional video recordings. One of the long-term objectives of our
group is to leverage these advances to develop software that can capture and quantify motor
abnormalities across multiple types of focal dystonia. We are calling this system the Computational
Motor Objective Rater (CMOR). In this project specifically targeting CD, our aims are 1) to evaluate
CMOR’s convergent validity with patient reports of severity of abnormal head posture and head tremor
and 2) to determine CMOR’s sensitivity to changes in severity associated with interventions. To
accomplish these aims, we will conduct CMOR analyses of motor symptoms from video recordings of
100 CD patients enrolled in a separate Dystonia Coalition project to evaluate the variability of efficacy
of BoNT. That project will also acquire patient reports in the form of a patient centered outcome with
specific questions about the two motor features of CD and the patient’s global impression of change
(PGIC) in response to each BoNT treatment. Collectively the results will provide important information
about CMOR’s validity and a quantitative basis for sample size estimates for future clinical trials in CD."
10813814,"Project Summary/Abstract
The discovery and manufacture of new life-saving medicines necessitates the development of new and
improved synthetic tools that can access complex, bioactive chemical structures in a selective and sustainable
manner. The proposed research program seeks to address this need by devising novel chemical reactions and
elucidating new principles of catalysis in the fields of transition metal and visible light photoredox catalysis.
The addition of saturated carbon atoms into chemical structures has been shown to confer improved bioactive
properties to drug candidates, prompting a need for the invention of improved C(sp3)–C bond-forming
reactions. Early work from our laboratory and others demonstrated that Ni and Ni/photoredox catalysis
present a versatile platform to generate and functionalize carbon-centered radicals in C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-
coupling. These reactions are being increasingly adopted by chemists in academia and the pharmaceutical
industry. Nevertheless, important challenges and opportunities remain, which the current proposal seeks to
address. These include: 1) the development of cross-selective C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reactions, with the
ultimate goal of affording a route to joining two saturated ring systems that is as versatile as traditional cross-
coupling for the assembly of biaryl architectures; 2) the identification of modular chiral ligand frameworks for
enantioselective and catalyst-controlled diastereoselective coupling reactions; and 3) the design of strategies
that overturn common site-selectivity for C(sp3)–H/O/N functionalization of small bioactive molecules.
Whereas most effort in the field of Ni and Ni/photoredox catalysis has focused on reaction discovery, our
program will also advance the field through ligand design and mechanistic studies. We will study the impact of
novel and established ligand classes on the structure and reactivity of catalytically relevant oxidation states of
Ni (0/I/II/III) with the goal of improving the efficiency of existing methods and enabling the design of new
reactions. Finally, despite numerous advances in the field of chemical catalysis, direct homolytic activation of
strong and redox-inaccessible C–O, O–H, and N–H bonds present in abundant feedstock chemicals and late-
stage bioactive compounds remains an outstanding challenge. Our program is addressing this gap by
developing a strategy that makes use of visible light photoredox catalysis and the single-electron redox
processes of phosphines for the activation of N–H heterocycles and aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic alcohols in
new bond-forming reactions. Taken together, these efforts will provide valuable new reactions and
understanding for the chemistry communities engaged in the discovery and synthesis of biologically active
small molecules. This program will also provide a platform for the scientific training and professional
development of a team of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate research assistants."
10819491,"ABSTRACT
The 2009 Tobacco Control Act (TCA) gave the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public
health but initially extended only to cigarettes. By the time other products were deemed under FDA authority in
2016, the tobacco landscape had changed dramatically, making modern tobacco surveillance increasingly
complex. Unfortunately, the cigarette-centric tobacco surveillance systems in the US have been slow to
respond to these changes. Even after formal calls for improvements in smokeless tobacco and cigar
measurement more than 20 years ago, standardized measures of these products remain sparse and
insufficient. Moreover, despite numerous early warning signals, questions about JUUL did not appear on major
national surveys such as National Youth Tobacco Survey until 2019, two full years after it became the top-
selling ENDS brand on the market and ENDS use among youth had reached concerning levels. Indeed, rapid
assessment and response to changes in the tobacco market are essential to informing and evaluating FDA’s
current and pending regulatory actions, including proposed product standards (e.g., banning menthol), pending
marketing authorizations for e-cigarettes, and the modified risk tobacco products (MRTPs) pathway. Therefore,
informed by a conceptual framework which draws upon a traditional public health surveillance perspective as
well as FDA’s Sentinel Initiative, this U01 proposal assembles a large collaborative network, which includes a
network of six sentinel states that triangulates multiple data sources to establish the Center for Rapid
Surveillance of Tobacco (CRST). The CRST aims to perform rapid surveillance of: 1) tobacco product
marketing, to generate signals of interest; 2) the tobacco product marketplace, to generate and refine signals
of interest; and 3) changes in tobacco product use behaviors, to generate, refine, and evaluate signals of
interest. We will implement an optimal rapid surveillance system of tobacco that will enhance FDA’s regulation
of tobacco products using a range of methods and subject matter experts to rapidly assess meaningful
changes in tobacco marketing, the tobacco marketplace, and tobacco use. The team assembled has deep
experience with tobacco regulatory science, surveillance and analyses of these data. We also have extensive
experience overseeing multi-site projects in collaboration with federal partners that support our ability to carry
out the administrative aspects of CRST. Our ongoing engagement with FDA CTP, federal partners, and
CASEL and deep knowledge of FDA’s regulatory authority and processes ensure that we will not only conduct
rapid surveillance, but anticipate changes in the market via early signal detection, and deliver meaningful data
to inform FDA’s activities and support a substantial public health impact. In doing so, we will establish a new
paradigm of tobacco surveillance, serve as a resource on surveillance methods and measures, support
evolutions in traditional surveillance measures, and meaningfully advance the field of tobacco regulatory
science."
10818436,"Transport, substrate specificity and regulation mechanisms of the ZIP transition metal transporters
Abstract
Some d-block transition metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Co, Mo and Ni) play key roles in catalysis, structural stability of
macromolecules, gene expression regulation and cell signaling. Living organisms have evolved systemic and
cellular mechanisms to harness the unique chemical properties of beneficial trace elements and meanwhile to
avoid toxicity upon overdose or mislocalization. The long-term goal of this research program is to clarify structural
and molecular basis of transition metal biology with a current focus on zinc, the second most abundant trace
element after iron in human body. Intracellular zinc concentration and subcellular distribution are tightly regulated
by coordinated action of zinc buffers/mufflers, zinc storage proteins, zinc-utilizing macromolecules, zinc-
responsive transcription factors and two specific zinc transporter families – the zinc transporter (ZnT, SLC30A)
family and the Zrt-/Irt-like protein (ZIP, SLC39A) family. In this MIRA application, our research focuses on the
ZIP family which is not only a central player in zinc homeostasis and zinc signaling but also critically involved in
Fe and Mn metabolism in humans. As an ancient protein family, the ZIPs are almost ubiquitous in living
organisms and play fundamental roles in transitional metal acquisition from environment and
distribution/redistribution within the body. In humans, a total of fourteen ZIPs exert distinct biological functions
and are associated with a variety of diseases, including several types of cancer. Albeit important biological
functions and critical roles in human health, much less is known about the ZIPs when compared to that of the
ZnT family. The last several years have witnessed rapid progress in research of the ZIPs made by metal biology
community including this research program. In the next five years we are planning to tackle the following three
important questions to further the understanding of the ZIPs at molecular level: (1) What is the structural basis
of substrate transport through the transporter? (2) Given the distinct substrate preference among the family
members, what are the key factors determining substrate specificity? Can substrate preference be fine-tuned
through adjusting the identified key factors for potential applications in agriculture and environmental protection?
and (3) What is the molecular basis of zinc-regulated post-translational regulation of human ZIPs? Through a
combination of structural, biochemical, biophysical and cell biological approaches, we are going to work on
representative family members, including a prokaryotic ZIP, the structure of which has provided a structural
framework for the entire family, a couple of human ZIPs associated with diseases and undergoing zinc-
dependent post-translational regulation, and a plant ZIP critically involved in cadmium uptake from soil and
accordingly a potential target for protein engineering. Success of this project will improve the understanding of
transport, substrate specificity and regulation of the ZIP transporters, and also shed light on mechanistic studies
of many other membrane transporters, particularly those involved in transition metal homeostasis and signaling."
11143550,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 8% of the human genome is composed of sequences directly derived from germline infections of
diverse retroviruses, which have accumulated over the past ~100 million years of mammalian evolution. None
of these human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are known to represent fully functional retroviruses, but most
have retained noncoding regulatory sequences that can control expression of cellular genes acting as promoters
or enhancers, and some still encode proteins with various functional activities. While HERV sequences are often
ignored as merely inconsequential ‘junk’ DNA, there is evidence that a subset of these elements play crucial
roles in human physiology and disease, including cancer. Our previous work, as well as that of others, have
shown that both HIV and EBV infections activate certain HERV families that have oncogenic activities, and our
preliminary data reveal an overlap between these elements. Given that diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DBCL)
are frequently associated with EBV infection in people living with HIV, we hypothesize that there is a complex
intercellular regulatory crosstalk between AIDS related (AR)-DLBCL, HIV-infected T cells and the tissue
microenvironment, that is in part mediated by a specific subset of HERVs and their derived products that are
synergistically activated and promote oncogenesis. We will study DLBCL obtained from patients with or without
EBV (and with or without HIV) from the USA and Brazil, which will be comprehensively characterized
pathologically and molecularly using single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics. We will analyze these data
using computational tools we have tailored to profile and link HERV and gene expression. Furthermore, we will
establish in vitro models to dissect with precision the functional impact of HERV on the crosstalk between T cells
infected by HIV and B cells with or without EBV. We will also determine if differential HERV expression creates
neoantigenic epitopes, a feature that can be exploited for immunotherapy. This will be accomplished through
three specific aims: 1) Characterize and profile HERV regulation and expression within single cells in DLBCL
and AR-DLBCL; 2) Establish in vitro models to dissect the interaction between cellular and endogenous and
exogenous viruses in AR-DLBCL; 3) Identification of neo-antigenic HERV epitopes in DLBCL and ascertain if
cloned HERV specific CTL can lyse lymphoma cells in vitro. Our team consists of specialists in lymphoma biology
and medicine, transposable elements and HERVs, HIV and EBV viral immunology. Together, we will generate
understandings of how HERVs contribute to the pathogenesis of AR-DLCBL, and identify new antigenic targets
for novel therapies."
10832547,"Project Abstract
Approximately 80% of early stage head and neck tumors undergo surgery of curative intent at some point in their
treatment course. The success of this oncologic surgery primarily depends on obtaining clear surgical margins.
Despite best efforts to obtain wide margins, the surgeon always struggles with removal of healthy, functional
tissue. This resulting tension often results in close (<5mm) or positive (tumor at cut surface) margins in 30% of
head and neck cancer resections. We have developed a strategy that could improve both intraoperative and ex
vivo margin assessment using a fluorescently labeled therapeutic antibody as a targeted imaging agent. We
hypothesize that fluorescence imaging of a systemically injected fluorescent anti-epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) antibody (EGFR is over-expressed in 80-90% patients with head and neck cancer) will direct
the attention of the surgeon and pathologist toward areas that are more likely to be tumor-positive and reduce
sampling error. This will lead to improved identification of tumor-positive margins, and thus improved surgical
outcome.

 There is an acute need to develop neuroprotective drugs to prevent or/and protect neuronal cell
damage and death caused by ischemia/reperfusion, hypoxia or cytotoxic agents in the brain. Plant-
based expression system can be used to produce asialo-rhuEPO, a non-hematopoietic
recombinant human EPO derivative lacking sialic acid, which could be used as a neuroprotective
agent for preventing and protecting brain damage from ischemia/reperfusion injury. In our previous
studies, we found that plant-produced asialo-rhuEPO (asialo-rhuEPOP) is non-erythropoietic and
displays excellent neuroprotective effects in a young mouse model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) I/R injury. Our previous studies have set the stage for the current proposed

 2 Brucellosis is one of the world’s most frequent zoonotic diseases with over 500,000
 3 new human infections every year. Human brucellosis in Brazil represents an additional
 4 economic burden due to health care costs and has a major social impact due to
 5 decreased productivity and quality of life and occasionally incapacitation or death.
 6 Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine is the principal vaccine used to prevent transmission
 7 of brucellosis from cattle to humans worldwide and in Brazil and it is not a select agent.
 8 The mechanisms that mediate protection by strain 19 are poorly understood. Host
 9 mechanisms of innate immunity induced by the vaccine that control infection remain
10 obscure. Additionally, the vaccine contains several properties that are inhibitory to host
11 immunity. We have demonstrated that B. abortus, bacterial DNA and LPS leads to
12 inflammasome activation via STING/GBP (guanylate-binding protein) axis that limits
13 Brucella replication. In contrast, B. abortus induces the Unfolded Protein Response
14 (UPR) that favors Brucella survival in the host. Therefore, our long-term goal is to
15 resolve the black box of how Brucella activates innate immune components that
16 results in host resistance versus bacterial subversion of the immune response.
17 Based on these compelling preliminary data, we propose to test the central hypothesis
18 that Brucella abortus strain 19 activates protective innate immune mediators via
19 STING/GBP pathway and triggers the UPR to secure intracellular replication. Our
20 specific aims are: 1) To define which STING-mediated guanylated-binding proteins
21 (GBPs) are important to release bacterial DNA and LPS into host cells to activate
22 inflammasome receptors; 2) To determine whether the Unfolded Protein
23 Response (UPR) induced by Brucella regulates macrophage polarization to
24 facilitate bacterial persistence; 3) To determine whether the transcription factor
25 HIF-1α-dependent metabolic changes in macrophages induced by Brucella affect
26 inflammasome activation and bacterial clearance. We believe that our approach will
27 shed light on the mechanisms of immunity and/or pathogenesis of this important
28 human and animal pathogen. Finally, the investigators on this proposal have a strong
29 track record in brucellosis research and a unique combination of key expertise in
30 microbiology, innate immunity and cell biology."

The Preclinical Models of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Cancer Core provides major resources to the three Program
Project Investigators, including viral mutants and strains, EBV+ and EBV- nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
gastric carcinoma cell lines; human gastric cancer organoid cultures; patient derived xenografts and other in vivo
models of EBV-associated cancers; compound testing; and recombinant viruses. Core C has acquired a large
repository of EBV+ and EBV- epithelial (gastric and nasopharyngeal) and lymphoid cell lines that have been
fingerprinted and are routinely verified by microsatellite/short terminal repeat (STR) testing to exclude cross-
contamination. In collaboration with Dr. Calvin Kuo (Stanford University), gastric cancer organoid cultures that
are now continuously available through Core C at The Wistar Institute. Organoids are superior to standard cell
culture because they recapitulate many features of the organs that they are derived from, including organ
ultrastructure, and mimic the tumor microenvironment. These organoid cultures will provide important tools for
studying viral and cellular determinants of Epstein-Barr virus-associated cancers (Project 1) and for drug
screening (Projects 2 and 3). Importantly, these organoid cultures are genetically tractable and TP53 and
ARID1A knockout organoid cultures are already available in Core C.
In addition to cell culture models, Core C routinely performs studies using several murine models of EBV-
associated cancers. Patient-derived xenografts that are exclusively maintained in vivo are available for all three
Projects. Cell line-derived models of EBV associated gastric carcinoma and NPC have been adapted for
bioluminescent imaging studies. These murine models will be used for compound testing (Projects 1-3) in
collaboration with Core B. Finally, Core C will provide high-titer, recombinant EBV (Projects 1-3) using a
bacterial artificial chromosome system to interrogate the specific contributions of EBV genes to the development
of cancer."
10839463,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
There is substantial evidence in virologically-suppressed people with HIV (vsPWH) that HIV persists in
monocytes and macrophages from blood and tissues. However, despite the likelihood that monocytes and
macrophages contribute to the size of the HIV reservoir, and may derail cure-based efforts, limited studies
exist investigating whether HIV within monocytes and macrophages can be reactivated to produce functional
virus in vsPWH. Additionally, despite known sex-based differences in the CD4 reservoir and immunological
response to HIV, there are no reported studies that have assessed sex-based differences in the myeloid
(monocyte/macrophage) reservoir in vsPWH. The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine if the myeloid
reservoir is a significant concern for cure-based efforts. The overall objectives are to (1) determine if there are
sex-based differences in the myeloid reservoir, (2) determine the stability of the myeloid reservoir in the blood
(monocyte derived macrophage, MDM) and brain (CNS) of vsPWH and SIV-ART macaques and (3) further
develop an easily deployable method to assess the myeloid reservoir in vsPWH. The central hypothesis of this
work is that there will be significant differences in the male and female MDM and CNS reactivatable reservoirs
in both HIV and SIV, and that these myeloid reservoirs will be stable throughout ART suppression. The
rationale for the proposed study is that delineating the size and stability of the MDM and CNS myeloid
reservoirs, and potential sex-based differences, will allow for the development of cure-based strategies that
appropriately target the myeloid reservoir in men and women with HIV. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursing two specific aims: 1. Define sex-based differences in the MDM HIV reservoir in vsPWH, and 2.
Define sex-based differences in the MDM and CNS reservoirs in SIV-ART macaques. These aims will
utilize novel HIV or SIV specific techniques, the monocyte derived macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth
assay (MDM-QVOA), the CNS macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth assay (CNS-QVOA) and a myeloid
adapted intact proviral DNA assay (mIPDA), to measure the replication-competent and intact viral reservoirs in
MDM (vsPWH and SIV-ART model) and the CNS (SIV-ART macaques). This research proposal is innovative
because it focuses on replication-competence rather than DNA, will elucidate potential sex-based differences
and address the stability of myeloid reservoirs in vsPWH and SIV-ART macaques. Finally, this proposal is
significant because it will provide essential insights into the monocyte and macrophage reservoir and help to
determine if HIV establishes true latency in cells of myeloid origin. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential
to alter cure-based efforts and therapeutics in men and women with HIV as the majority of current efforts are
entirely T cell focused."
10846618,"Project Summary:
Adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) is a neurological voice disorder characterized by laryngeal spasms. A
secondary symptom is increased vocal effort, likely related to compensatory increases in laryngeal tension.
Voice symptoms significantly impact psychosocial well-being and quality of life. Gold-standard management
requires repeated injections of botulinum toxin (BTX) into laryngeal muscles, each of which provides temporary
reduction in symptoms. New approaches for long-lasting treatment are under development, but can only be
translated to clinical practice if they are evaluated using robust outcomes of vocal function. Unfortunately, there
is a dearth of outcomes that are sufficiently sensitive and specific to the voice symptoms of AdLD. In fact,
clinicians often have difficulty differentiating AdLD from muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), a functional voice
disorder in which there is increased global laryngeal tension without laryngeal spasms, since the two voice
disorders can have shared auditory-perceptual characteristics. To address this gap, objective measures
reflective of both the primary and secondary voice symptoms of AdLD are needed. In our previous grant cycle,
we validated two automated estimates of laryngeal tension (a secondary symptom of AdLD): the kinematic
measure, kinematic stiffness (KS), and the acoustic measure, relative fundamental frequency (RFF). We also
developed a new, automated spectral acoustic measure designed to capture laryngeal spasms in AdLD (a
primary symptom) via detection of pitch breaks (high-passed spectral power of the pitch contour; HSPC).
Combining HSPC and RFF measures, we were able to predict the overall severity of dysphonia in AdLD with
R2=85%. While these results are promising, they must be validated in a larger sample. Thus, we propose an
observational study to construct and validate automated kinematic and acoustic measures of the primary and
secondary symptoms in AdLD. We will assess the physiological and discriminant validity, sensitivity to
change (pre/post treatment), test-retest reliability, and ability of these measures to predict voice severity in
AdLD. In Aim 1 we will compare acoustic estimates of the primary and secondary symptoms of AdLD with
kinematic measures in individuals with AdLD and individuals with MTD. Results will determine the sensitivity
and specificity of these measures and provide the physiological validation of the acoustic measures. In Aim 2
we will assess the sensitivity to change and test-retest reliability of the acoustic and kinematic measures,
validating their use as clinical outcome measures in future assessments of treatment efficacy. Finally, in Aim 3
we will construct and evaluate a statistical acoustic model of overall severity of dysphonia in a large cohort of
speakers with AdLD. Completion of these aims will result in validated, objective, and automated measures of
vocal function that are specific to AdLD, with the potential to be translated immediately to clinical practice."

BRCA1 is an established tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in the development of both sporadic and
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Considered a “master regulator” of genome integrity, BRCA1 has been
linked to nearly all aspects of chromatin biology. Loss of BRCA1 is embryonic lethal and leads to cellular
defects in stress signaling, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, chromatin condensation, and gene
expression. Each of these processes involves dynamic changes in chromatin architecture that regulate spatial
and temporal access to genomic DNA. Although implicated in various mechanisms of chromatin modification
and remodeling, a mechanistic understanding of BRCA1’s role in regulating chromatin dynamics has been
difficult to establish due to the global consequences of its dysfunction. Recently, we established a cell-free
system that supports transcription of naturally chromatinized plasmid substrates in Xenopus egg extract.
Transcriptional activity in extract is tightly coupled to changes in chromatin modification and structure,
providing a powerful tool to study how regulation of chromatin dynamics controls gene expression. By coupling
this system with established approaches used to elucidate mechanisms of DNA replication and DNA repair, we
are now poised to examine the interplay between these fundamental processes. Indeed, BRCA1’s role as a
sensor for genomic stress places it at the center of genome utilization, maintenance, and repair. In this
proposal, we seek to understand how BRCA1 and other chromatin regulators control access to DNA in
response to different cellular events. Together, these studies will provide new mechanistic insight into the
complexities of chromatin signaling that remain an essential, but poorly understood regulator of genome
integrity."
10772164,"The age-related processes that contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, particularly in the
prodromal period, are incompletely understood. Age-related reduction in gut microbiome alpha-diversity is
apparent in the majority of older adults, and is suspected of contributing to brain changes, including the
development of neurodegenerative disease. Our team published the first comprehensive report describing
differences in the gut microbiome observed in AD dementia, including reduced diversity in gut microbiota and
altered composition in people with AD dementia compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, we found that
differentially abundant genera were associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of AD, even among
individuals who were cognitively unimpaired. Several studies in mouse models of AD indicate that gut microbiota
play a role in the development of AD neuropathology, however to date, the mechanisms underlying these effects
are virtually unknown. Recently it has also become clear that the innate immune response in AD plays a critical
role in mediating the pathology associated with AD; however the interplay between systemic changes and the
innate immune response in AD are not well understood, nor is it known how these factors impact the progression
of AD pathology. Our overarching goal is to determine the extent to which alterations in the composition of gut
microbiome exacerbate and/or accelerate the development of AD pathology. This proposal is based on the
central hypothesis that age-associated gut dysbiosis and inflammation weaken gut barrier function, which in turn
leads to the systemic dissemination of microbial components, driving an immune response and system wide
changes that worsen AD pathology. To test this hypothesis we propose to study well-characterized participants
enrolled in the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center as well as conventional and gnotobiotic
APPPS1 mice, to address the following specific aims: 1. Determine the longitudinal relationship between gut
microbiome (metagenome), gut inflammation and permeability, and the development of AD pathology in
human participants, and 2. Determine the effects of modifying gut permeability on AD pathology in mice.
We expect that alterations in gut microbiome composition and gut permeability exacerbate AD pathology in
humans, and that impairment of intestinal barrier function and increased gut permeability alters brain
homeostasis and exacerbates AD progression in mouse models of AD. Our research group has been working
to determine the role of gut microbiome in the development of AD pathology for the past 5 years, and we are
perfectly poised to address the proposed aims. We will leverage our expertise in clinical AD, neuroimmunology,
and gut microbiology/gnotobiotic mouse models to successfully carry out the proposed project. Completion of
the proposed experiments is expected to lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for AD and
related dementias."

Patients with concerning breast masses require diagnosis, triage, and management. This proposal seeks to
combine three recently developed technologies to provide rapid diagnostic support for patient breast tumor
evaluation. Currently, this process consists of biopsy, standard histology, phenotype determination via im-
munohistochemistry, and increasingly, molecular assays. In well-served areas, the challenges involve obtain-
ing appropriate and representative biopsies, waiting for slide preparation, review by a pathologist, then im-
munostaining (IHC), and optionally, submission for nucleic-acid based studies.
We propose a simple tissue-direct-to-digital slide-free imaging solution (FIBI, fluorescence imitating brightfield
imaging, UC Davis) coupled with a virtually hands-off millifluidic specimen handling device (CoreView, UW).
Images, intrinsically digital, are of diagnostic quality, and can be interpreted locally by trained pathology per-
sonnel, or streamed anywhere in the world for real-time evaluation. Eventually, on-site or cloud-based com-
puter-assisted tools will be available. An additional goal is to achieve same-session multiplexed immunostain-
ing and imaging, based on rapid-quench click chemistry approaches developed by Dr. Ko (Univ. Penn.)
We will build and test versions of the combined imaging and automated sample handling of needle-derived
specimens initially using excess fresh or recently fixed human breast tissue, and subsequently clinically ac-
quired core-needle biopsies. Tasks involve optimization of staining, imaging, image display, reproducibility
demonstration, and sample integrity assessments. Incorporation of single-step immunostaining with far-red la-
bels will be included, and methods for rapid probe cycling (for multiplexing—ER, PR, HER2) will be applied and
tested. Subspecialty pathology review will ensure that the FIBI images and immunostains are reliable and of
diagnostic quality. The goal is to implement a context-appropriate, automated instrument that can capture his-
topathology images from core-needle biopsies, while retaining their integrity for downstream processing as
needed. Results will be available within minutes and allow for informed patient triage or even immediate on-site
treatment, especially valuable if the patient has had to travel long distances to reach the clinic.
Statement of Potential Impact: Current biopsy evaluation interposes at least 1-3 days delay, and involves
consuming some or all of small tissue specimens. Immunostaining contributes additional delay. The situation is
more challenging in poorly served areas, as histology laboratories and the pathologists capable of interpreting
the results are rare outside major urban centers. The CoreView-FIBI approach could dramatically improve pa-
tient-level care velocity, but also enterprise-level efficiency, allowing for same-day disease treatment planning.
For biospecimen applications, preanalytical variables will be under complete control, the non-destructive nature
of the imaging means that more tissue is available for storage and research, and imaging of the specimen prior
to banking provide assurance of tissue content and abundance estimates of relevant components."

10835983,"HCV Vaccine Program Project 1 Summary
Evidence from chimpanzee and human studies support critical roles for CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte responses
in the control HCV infection, yet defining the correlates of protective HCV immunity has been challenging.
Identifying CD4 and CD8 T cell memory that protects against infection from multiple different HCV genotypes
and subtypes is a cornerstone in prophylactic HCV vaccine design. Our groups at Johns Hopkins University and
Massachusetts General Hospital have contributed many key findings to the current understanding of HCV-
specific T cell immunity, based on the combination of large and well documented patient cohorts with robust and
sensitive experimental tools for the assessment of both CD8 and CD4 responses targeting HCV.
We will build on this expertise and employ newly developed approaches to study the metabolism and
transcriptional landscape of HCV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in order to assess T cell immunity in unique
patient cohorts. We previously demonstrated that clearance occurs more often in reinfection than in primary
infection, with reduced peak and duration of viremia associated with broadened T cell responses vs. initial
infection of the same person. This suggests induction of memory that protects against infection from multiple
different HCV genotypes and subtypes - a central goal of prophylactic HCV vaccine design. Using a population
of patients who have cleared as many as six distinct HCV infections, we plan to better define the specific
correlates of T cell mediated protection from chronic HCV infection. In addition, we will leverage access to
research specimens from the only prophylactic HCV vaccine regiment tested in an at-risk human population.
This regimen, consisting of a ChAd3NS prime followed by an MVA-NS boost, did not protect against chronic
infection, but did induce T cells specific for vaccine NS antigens and suppressed geometric mean peak HCV
RNA vs. placebo recipients. Specimens from this trial provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of vaccine-
induced T cells on incident HCV infection, allowing us to further validate T cell properties associated with control
of HCV, but also to identify the reasons for failure of this potent T cell based vaccine. Specifically, we propose:
Aim 1: To define the critical characteristics of HCV-specific CD8 T-cell responses in spontaneous recovery from
repeated HCV infection as determinants of protective immunity. Aim 2 To determine if specific CD8 T cell
characteristics are associated with vaccine induced suppression of peak viremia in subsequent HCV infection.
Aim 3: To define effective CD4 T cell responses in acute infection and HCV-specific CD4 memory T cells in
patients with multiple episodes of successfully controlled HCV infection. Aim 4: To characterize the HCV-specific
CD4 memory T cell population post vaccination and its response after HCV exposure.
We build on our combined extensive expertise in studying both CD8 and CD4 T cell responses in order to define
the effector and memory T cell responses that control diverse HCV infections, defining goals for T cell induction
in HCV vaccines to be tested in Projects 3 (non-human primates) and 5 (mice) and, ultimately, in humans."
10835990,"Project Summary
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) block infection by diverse HCV strains in vitro, and infusion of bNAbs
is protective against HCV infection in animal models. In contrast to some other chronic viral infections like HIV-
1 where bNAbs do not appear to influence disease outcome, early development of high plasma bNAb titers is
associated with spontaneous clearance of primary HCV infection in humans. Although it is clear that bNAbs
can play a critical role in clearance of primary HCV infection, detailed analysis of antibody titers, epitopes
targeted, and B cell phenotypes associated with clearance of infection are still lacking. Individuals who clear
multiple reinfections may be the ideal study subjects to further define protective antibody responses. Of those
who clear their first infection, 80% clear subsequent reinfections with a rapid rise in neutralizing antibody (NAb)
titers, shorter duration of infection, and lower peak viremia, demonstrating protective adaptive immunity that
can serve as a model for a desired vaccine response. It is not known which parameters of the B cell response
are most critical for repeated clearance of infection, or what antigenic stimuli are necessary for induction of
these responses.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will define plasma anti-HCV antibody binding and neutralizing activity associated
with repeated clearance of reinfection. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanistic basis for changes in
neutralizing activity by characterizing the dynamic interplay between the circulating B cell repertoire and HCV
sequence changes during reinfection. In Aim 3, we will define phenotypes of HCV-specific B cells associated
with repeated clearance of reinfection.
Because reinfections are generally cleared very efficiently, these immune responses can serve as a model for
responses that should be induced by a vaccine. By characterizing plasma antibody responses, B cell
repertoires, viral antigenic variation, and B cell phenotypes in human subjects with repeated spontaneous
clearance of infection, we will inform HCV vaccine development."
10836000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic HCV infection is a leading cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet no vaccine has been
developed against HCV due to its extremely high genetic diversity. Despite the high variability of the virus, 30%
of HCV-infected individuals clear the viral infection by developing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that
bind to conserved epitopes in the receptor binding site of HCV glycoprotein E2 and conformational epitopes
spanning the E1E2 heterodimer. If we could stimulate the production of such HCV bNAbs along with protective
T cell responses by vaccination, a rising epidemic of HCV might be stopped.
We recently identified several E2 proteins from different HCV isolates that bind to germline precursors of human
bNAbs, suggesting vaccine development using these variants. However, it is not yet clear which would make a
more effective vaccine candidate: E2-based or E1E2-based immunogens. In this proposal, we aim to evaluate
both sets of vaccine candidates along with different methods of immunogen delivery in non-human primates that
include germline gene segments capable of targeting E1E2 neutralizing epitopes. The work is organized into
three major Specific Aims. Aim #1: Develop immunization strategies that elicit bNAbs to conserved HCV E1E2
epitopes. Working together with Project 5, we will test different immunization platforms in mice, evaluating both,
the development of neutralizing antibodies to E1E2 conformational epitopes (this Project), and multi-specific T
cell responses (Project 1). Next, the best vaccine candidates with respect to both T cell and antibody induction
will each be tested in non-human primates, which utilize an ortholog of an antibody gene segment frequently
used by the most potent human HCV-specific bNAbs. Aim #2: Generate high-resolution structures of E2-specific
bNAbs elicited after vaccination in non-human primates and after clearance of natural HCV infection in humans.
In addition to analyzing serum responses from immunized animals in Aim 1, we will generate high-resolution
crystal structures of vaccine-induced bNAbs or human antibodies isolated from individuals who cleared their
infection (Project 2). We will sort and sequence antibody genes in E2-specific macaque B cells after immunization
and express antibodies from these sequences. We will then determine the structures of vaccine-induced bNAbs
in complex with immunogens and compare them to structures of human bNAbs bound to E2 proteins (Project 4)
to elucidate the structural determinants of broad neutralization of HCV. Aim #3: Determine a structure of the full-
length E1E2 heterodimer in a membrane environment using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). To expand
upon bNAb-E2 structures from Aim 2, we will use cryo-ET with sub-tomogram averaging to examine bNAb
recognition of the E1E2 heterodimer in its intact membrane form. Together, the results of these aims will lead to
the comprehensive characterization of novel vaccine candidates that elicit HCV-specific bNAbs and strong T-
cell responses, facilitating the development of an effective HCV vaccine."
10836009,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects more than 71 million people and causes liver scarring and cancer. An effective
vaccine to prevent infection is urgently required. This should be an achievable goal, since 25% of individuals
spontaneously resolve (SR) primary infection generating anti-viral immunity. An effective vaccine may need
to mimic the immune responses associated with SR including the induction of anti-HCV neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs) and HCV-specific T cells. One method to achieve this, is through the use of viral vectored
vaccines (both chimpanzee Adenoviral [ChAd] and modified vaccinia Ankara [MVA]), which have emerged
as powerful tools to generate immune responses against an encoded immunogen, including HCV. However,
viral genetic diversity is a major challenge for the development of HCV vaccines, with at least eight distinct
genotypes (gt) and multiple subtypes between and within HCV infected people. Recently, a viral vectored
vaccine encoding a single gt-1b sequence failed to prevent chronic infection, highlighting the need to develop
new approaches with novel HCV immunogens that generate NAbs and T cells against multiple gts. Project 5
tests the hypothesis that an optimized viral vectored HCV vaccine strategy can generate anti-HCV nAbs and
cross-reactive T cells. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims. Aim 1 uses bioinformatic
analysis and generates novel T cell immunogens encoded in ChAd and MVA, designed to generate broad T
cell coverage to all HCV gts assessed in inbred, outbred and (HLA-2) humanised mice. The most promising
T cell immunogen(s) will then progress to aim 2. Aim 2 will increase viral vectored vaccine generated T cell
responses using genetic adjuvants (including variants of class II invariant chain) and assess alternative
adenovirus vectors to overcome potential anti-vector immunity, that may be present in humans. Aim 3 will
develop new vaccine strategies to generate both anti-HCV Abs and also T cells. This will be achieved through
assessing: i) Different B cell immunogens (identified in project 2 and 3) encoded in viral vectored vaccines;
ii) Combining promising T cell vaccine candidates with strategies designed to generate bNAbs including Viral
Like Particles (VLP) or nanoparticles that present the HCV envelope (E2) from Project 3 or with a ChAd
expressing E proteins; and iii) developing a single ‘bivalent’ viral vectored vaccine that encodes the optimal
B cell and T cell immunogens together. Importantly, the project will also take account of findings in partner
projects should T cell profiles (project 1) or viral sequence motifs (project 4) linked to SR be identified.
Together the aims will contribute to developing an optimized viral vectored HCV vaccine strategy for
assessment in Rhesus monkeys with a view to future human clinical trials."
10843200,"Project Summary
Pregnant women are highly vulnerable to influenza A virus (IAV) and are at increased risk for maternal death,
preterm birth and stillbirth. Universal influenza vaccines (UFV) are thought to be possible if conserved regions of
influenza virus are targeted and appropriate immune responses generated. However, relevant animal models are
lacking in which to test such a vaccine, particularly for pregnant women. This proposal is focused on investigating
maternal and placental immune responses to IAV in a pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) model to understand the
viral-host factors driving enhanced maternal disease. Our central hypothesis is that an aberrant Th17 response
during an acute IAV infection leads to a broadly dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune response that
prevents viral clearance and enhances risk for maternal death and stillbirth. Th17 cells produce high levels of
the inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-2218,19 with early Th17 polarization considered to be critical for IAV
resolution; aberrant and/or late activation of the Th17 pathway by IL-23 in murine models is thought to impair viral
clearance and promote lung injury.20,21 Our preliminary data in a pregnant NHP model of an acute IAV H1N1 infection
demonstrates pneumonia in all animals by Day 5 post-IAV inoculation. In pregnant NHP, influenza disease scores
were higher than non-pregnant animals with notable extra-pulmonary organ injury (myocarditis, white matter injury).
Pregnant NHP demonstrated a nearly absent early Th17 CD4+ T cell response in whole blood and PBMC coupled
with a marked increase in Th17 cells in the lung at peak immunopathology compared to non-pregnant animals.
Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) were also greater in
pregnant versus non-pregnant animals. In Aim 1, non-pregnant and pregnant pigtail macaques will be challenged
with either IAV H1N1 A/CA/04/09 or H3N2 A/Texas/71/2017 (N=8, each group) and undergo blood and BAL
sampling until necropsy at Day 5 (peak immunopathology). In Aims 1A and 1B, we will determine pregnancy-
specific immune correlates of IAV disease by evaluating the frequency of Th17 CD4+ T cells and a broad spectrum
of innate/adaptive immune responses (i.e. immune cell subsets, cytokines/chemokines, Type I/III interferons) in the
blood, BAL and lung. In Aim 1C, we will evaluate antiviral responses in the placenta linked to adverse pregnancy
outcomes (e.g. cytokines/chemokines, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, CD8+ T cells). In Aim 2, we will use bulk
and single cell RNA-sequencing to define changes in the transcriptome within PBMC, BAL, lung and placenta with
a focus on Th17 transcriptional networks and antiviral innate immune pathways. In summary, the preliminary data
indicates an aberrant Th17 response in pregnant animals, which is critical to promoting viral clearance and
preventing lung injury. These studies will be the first to comprehensively analyze innate/adaptive immune responses
during an acute IAV infection to elucidate the pathogenesis of severe lung disease in pregnant women. Results from
these studies are critical for IAV pandemic preparedness to enable testing of efficacy and safety of new UFV."

The WHO approved 3 months weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) has been found non-inferior to 6H in
preventing TB reactivation and achieves higher completion rates. The National TB program in Uganda is
currently transitioning from 6HP to 3HP which will be scaled up starting in Jan 2021. Rifapentine has not been
widely used in Uganda outside clinical trials and therefore its safety profile in programmatic setting in adults and
children is still uncertain. Accurate profiling of patients likely to experience 3HP related adverse drug reactions
(ADRs) has the potential to improve TPT completion rates, and in turn improve TB control. Our proposal seeks
to describe safety profiles of 3HP, completion rates and the clinical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic
determinants of 3HP-related ADRs for people receiving TPT at programmatic level. This study will take place in
five health facilities in Uganda in collaboration with the National TB program and the National Drug Authority.
We will conduct a cohort study where 614 adults and children >2 years, who have been initiated on 3HP for TPT
by the facility clinician according to standard of care will be enrolled. Participants will be both HIV-infected and
HIV-uninfected. Participants will be followed up monthly for evaluation for ADRs using a standardized
questionnaires, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests (liver function testing). For a subset of 300 patients (150
cases who develop grade 2 and above ADRs and 150 controls who do not experience ADRs), we will conduct
pharmacokinetic sampling to measure rifapentine and isoniazid concentrations and selected genotyping (for
examples N-Acetyl Transferase, Cytochrome 2E1) and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. We will use
pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenetic-pharmacodynamic models and stochastic gradient boosted machine learning
together with conventional statistical methods to determine factors associated with ADRs and simple prediction
rules for the identification of patients at high risk for ADR. We will also determine the effect of the ADRs on TPT
completion rates. Patients will subsequently be followed up for up to 3 years and assessed for TB reactivation
according to standard of care to determine the incidence of TB reactivation in patients who have received 3HP
and the risk factors for this.
This study will provide data on the safety of 3HP during national roll-out and provide information on who is likely
to develop ADRs which can affect treatment completion and therefore may benefit from alternative regimens."

 The increasing pervasiveness of highly lethal fentanyl and fentanyl analogs in the illicit drug supply in
the United States, including Ohio, has posed a substantial challenge for public health officials seeking
interventions to reduce unintentional overdoses. Rapid fentanyl test strips, designed to test for the presence of
fentanyl and some fentanyl analogs in urine samples, are increasingly being used off-label by people who use
drugs to test illicit drugs for fentanyl before consumption. Recent research indicates that when people who use
drugs receive a positive fentanyl test result, they are more likely to perform overdose risk reduction behaviors
(e.g., using less of the drug). However, due to the emergent nature of this harm reduction strategy, peer-
reviewed published research on this topic is very limited. We propose to test an intervention to provide fentanyl
test strip education and distribution to people who use drugs in a subset of opioid overdose education and
naloxone distribution sites in rural and urban counties in Ohio. The long-term goal of this research is the
reduction of overdose-related morbidity and mortality in Ohio and nationally. The research objectives of this
study are: 1) Determine the feasibility and acceptability of providing fentanyl test strip education and testing
materials distribution in existing opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution programs; and 2)
Determine if adding fentanyl test strip education and distribution to opioid overdose education and naloxone
distribution programs decreases opioid overdose rates among people who use drugs. Using a two-arm cluster-
randomized trial design, we will answer the research objectives by testing the following 3 specific aims: 1)
Determine the perceived barriers and facilitating factors associated with incorporating fentanyl test strip
education and distribution in existing opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution programs in rural
and urban counties; 2) Test the hypothesis that people who use drugs who receive fentanyl test strip education
and testing materials as part of an opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution program will have
improved knowledge and self-efficacy regarding how to test drugs for fentanyl and strategies for lowering their
risk of an opioid overdose; and 3) Test the hypothesis that individuals who receive fentanyl test strip education
and testing materials as part of an opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution program will have a
lower opioid overdose rate than individuals who receive opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution
only (“usual practice”). Fentanyl test strip use is becoming more common, but research supporting the practice
is limited. We will investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and associated benefits and harms of integrating
fentanyl test strip education and distribution into existing opioid overdose education and naloxone distribution
programs in rural and urban communities."

Despite significant advances made in understanding the genetic basis of the more than 10,000 estimated
Mendelian conditions in recent decades, further scientific collaboration and discovery is required to identify the
full set of Mendelian diseases and their underlying genetic causes. To build on the success of the Centers for
Mendelian Genomics by using further technological, methodological, and data-sharing innovations, NHGRI is
establishing a new Mendelian Genomics Research Consortium. As Data Coordinating Center for this
Consortium, we propose to further the discovery and characterization of Mendelian conditions by achieving
four main aims. (1) Managing the release of molecular and phenotypic data generated or collected by the
Consortium's Research Centers, featuring semi-automated and scalable quality control procedures that will
validate incoming data against collaboratively-established standards and requirements. We will facilitate data
sharing within the Consortium and the broader scientific community by ensuring that curated data are
submitted to appropriate repositories including AnVIL, ClinVar, and Matchmaker Exchange. (2) Supporting
program outreach through a Consortium website that highlights program progress and discoveries and
enabling connections among researchers, clinicians, and families. We will also oversee education, training,
and mentorship opportunities. (3) Coordinating logistics for the Consortium, including organization of virtual
and in-person meetings and administrative support for all Consortium-wide activities. (4) Overseeing an
Opportunity Fund, administering up to 5 awards in each of years 2-5 of the Consortium, to support novel and
scalable approaches to functional follow-up on candidate variants. To achieve these four main aims, we
propose innovative approaches, including leveraging emerging cloud-based systems for the storage and
analysis of human genetic data and integrating international data sharing standards to ensure that data is
findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we bring a unique blend of expertise
across the fields of data science, cloud systems, biostatistics, bioethics, clinical genetics, and Mendelian
discovery to the Consortium, and our application rests on 13 successful years of experience and expertise
serving as Coordinating or Analysis Centers for 7 large-scale genetic and biomedical projects. Through support
and coordination of this Consortium, we will help yield the benefits of identifying the genetic basis of Mendelian
conditions to support diagnosis, therapy, and further delineation of syndromes. Further public health benefit will
accrue via biological insights into Mendelian diseases that also advance our understanding of related common,
complex diseases."

The long-term objectives of the proposed short-term training program are: 1) to inspire commitment to research
careers in vision science among optometry students, including women and underrepresented groups, and 2) to
foster a better understanding of vision research and evidence based clinical practice. The specific aim is to
increase the number of clinician scientists who can do basic, clinical, and translational investigative work on
vision and vision disorders through early exposure to research. The program has operated successfully since
1985. Almost 390 optometry students have been trained, including students from underrepresented groups, and
students from 11 optometry schools other than the University of Houston. The program provides opportunities
for academically qualified and motivated students to spend three months learning to formulate testable vision-
research questions and to develop research skills by doing a research project mentored by 1 of 19 experienced
vision scientists. The mentors' research programs fall into the following broad areas: 1) visual development,
plasticity, repair, and aging of structure and function, 2) visual optics and refractive error, 3) ocular surface and
anterior segment, 4) oculomotor systems, 5) structure and function in normal and diseased eyes, and visual
pathways, 6) visual cell and molecular biology and immunology, 7) spatio-temporal vision, and 8) binocular
vision. Twelve students will be recruited each of the next five years for NEI fellowships, with another two or more
supported by local funds for the program. Selection will be based on scholarship, particularly in sciences, as well
as on research interest, potential, and experience. Trainees will be first year optometry students. In addition to
research, trainees will participate in: 1) a 2-hr course on responsible conduct of research, research design,
reproducibility, methodology and communication of findings, 2) a 1-hr weekly seminar given by local and visiting
vision scientists, and 3) lab meetings and journal clubs. Trainees will have access to first-rate facilities and
resources, including well-equipped basic and clinical/translational research space, a full scope of technical
services (bio-imaging, research computer programming, instrumentation, biostatistics), animal viviarium, and a
vision and health science library with full electronic access – all in modern buildings on a major university
campus.
Public Health: The proposed short term training program for optometry students will improve visual health by
increasing the number of clinician scientists doing basic, clinical and translational research on vision disorders.
The program encourages participation by underrepresented groups in vision care and science."
10848187,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cells have numerous strategies to cope with the consequences of stresses that cause protein
misfolding and aggregation and lead to formation of plaques, fibrils, and other aggregated
species encountered in aging cells, cataract, and neurodegenerative diseases. The protein
chaperones known as small heat shock proteins are the cell’s first responders and are therefore
key to maintenance of cellular health. Ocular tissues are subjected to stresses such as
exposure to UV light, smoking, hypoxia, and ischemia. sHSP function is linked to three of the
most prevalent ocular pathologies leading to blindness worldwide: cataract, age-related macular
degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy which together account for 65% of world blindness. In
lens, sHSPs perform the critical task of maintaining lens transparency and failure to do so is
directly linked to cataract. sHSPs are expressed constitutively in retinal cells and are
upregulated following injury or stress. Mechanisms used by sHSPs to delay the onset of
aggregation of proteins remain enigmatic due to technical challenges posed by sHSPs and the
aggregate-prone proteins they protect. Recent developments in the study of disordered proteins
and breakthroughs made during the previous period of this long-standing project promise to
overcome this critical barrier to mechanistic understanding. Techniques such as NMR,
hydrogen-deuterium exchange/mass spectrometry, and covalent cross-linking/mass
spectrometry can provide fine-grained information regarding disordered regions of sHSPs that
have largely gone uncharacterized but are known to be essential for sHSP activity. The goal of
this renewal application is to develop a holistic (“characterized by comprehension of the parts of
something as intimately interconnected and explicable only by reference to the whole”)
understanding of sHSP structure and function. The effects of stress conditions, modifications,
and mutations will be assessed and interpreted in the context of the resultant novel models."

Summary
The paracrine factors that drive prostate development and disease are still unknown. We recently discovered a
population of interstitial fibroblasts that surround the prostatic urethra of the normal prostate and are sparse in
the transition zone. We showed that the characteristic nodules that form in human benign prostatic hyperplasia
(BPH) are an expansion of interstitial fibroblasts in the transition zone. Key preliminary spatial transcriptomic
analysis of interstitial fibroblasts inside BPH nodules revealed the enrichment of mitogens and morphogens that
are normally only expressed during organogenesis. These data represent a breakthrough in our understanding
of stromal-epithelial interactions in human BPH and could help solve the long-held hypothesis that BPH is a
reawakening of the embryonic signaling that induces prostate development.
We will test the hypothesis that paracrine signaling from interstitial fibroblasts drives prostate branching
morphogenesis in development and disease with three critical lines of inquiry: 1) spatial transcriptomics analysis
of interstitial fibroblasts in human prostate development and BPH; 2) mechanistic analysis of paracrine
morphogens and mitogens on adult prostate epithelial proliferation and branching ex vivo; and 3) in vivo analysis
of autocrine regulation of prostate epithelial proliferation by the receptors of interstitial fibroblast ligands.
Successful completion of our aims will establish a new mechanism of prostate growth that is actionable in clinical
trials.
Relevance
Establishing the paracrine factors responsible for prostate growth holds great promise for identifying novel
approaches to medical therapy for the reversal or prevention of hyperplasia."
10884882,"Germline mutations in BRCA2 predispose carriers to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and other cancers. The gene
encodes a very large protein that plays critical roles in genome integrity control by promoting homologous
recombination (HR)-mediated repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), DNA damage-induced cell cycle
checkpoint, and stability of stalled DNA replication forks, etc. Besides, BRCA2 may play a direct role in DNA
replication, as its mutant cells have long been known to have the so-called radio-resistant DNA synthesis
(RDS) phenotype, which reflects a defect in the intra-S phase checkpoint, a mechanism that slows down DNA
replication after DNA damage presumably to allow time for DNA repair and prevent replication of damage
DNA. However, the potential role of BRCA2 in DNA replication initiation or elongation has not been defined. In
our preliminary studies, we found that BRCA2 interacts with an essential DNA replication factor, MCM10, and
that this interaction restrains replication fork progression, promotes fork stalling and sustains origin firing after
DNA damage. We hypothesize that BRCA2 regulates DNA replication kinetics after DNA damage through its
interaction with MCM10 and that a dysregulation of replication kinetics after DNA damage, or intra-S phase
checkpoint defect, leads to increased mutation rate, cancer development and therapy resistance. We propose
3 specific aims to test the hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms of BRCA2 function in DNA
replication kinetics after DNA damage. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of the BRCA2-MCM10 interaction in
DNA replication fidelity and cancer cell response to DNA damaging therapies. In Aim 3, we will determine the
role of BRCA2-MCM10 interaction in spontaneous and radiation-induced tumor development. Our findings and
proposed studies will elucidate key mechanisms of BRCA2 function in DNA replication, provide new insights
into the regulation of replication kinetics after DNA damage, and define the impact of RDS and replication
kinetics dysregulation on cancer development and tumor relapse after radiation and chemotherapy."
10839907,"The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is an important regulator of bone, and may contribute to bone
pathology during aging. SNS activity is also heightened in post-menopausal women, causing reduced bone
formation by osteoblasts and increased bone resorption by osteoclasts, which leads to bone loss. Large meta-
analyses, osteoporosis cohort studies (preliminary data from co-I Dr. Lary) and new prospective trials,
consistently show that β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) antagonists (i.e. β-blockers) are associated with reduced
fracture risk, increased bone mineral density (BMD), and reduced bone resorption. However, mechanistic
studies have focused largely on the osteoblast as the target of SNS activity. Humans and mice have three
βARs: β1AR, β2AR and β3AR. The gene encoding β2AR (Adrb2) is highly expressed in bone, which also
expresses lower levels of Adrb1, but does not express Adrb3. In mice, Adrb2 deletion in osteoblasts improves
bone formation and prevents receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-mediated osteoclast
recruitment after stimulation with a β-agonist. In humans, β1-selective β-blockers are used most often, but their
selectivity is not absolute, and many still bind β2AR. Propranolol, a non-selective β-blocker, increases BMD in
the majority of preclinical studies. Results from our laboratory show that propranolol can limit bone resorption
directly in vitro, and in vivo without changing RANKL levels. This is in contrast to the established dogma that
osteoblast expression of β2AR regulates osteoclasts only indirectly via RANKL. Our proposed work will resolve
the outstanding mechanistic questions of how β1AR and β2AR directly influence osteoclast differentiation and
what their contributions are to age- and SNS-related bone loss. We propose a novel hypothesis that βAR
signaling in osteoclasts promotes differentiation and resorption and contributes to bone loss in vivo. To fully
characterize βAR receptor subtypes and novel signaling mechanisms in osteoclasts, and to determine the
contribution of βAR subtypes to in vivo phenotypes of bone density and bone remodeling, we propose a
combination of genetic and pharmacologic in vivo and in vitro approaches in the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: We will identify signaling mechanisms activated by specific βARs in osteoclasts. We expect
that we will identify novel and established target pathways to test in vivo for efficacy in modulating bone
resorption. Specific Aim 2: We will test the relative contributions of osteoclast β1AR and β2AR to SNS-
mediated and aging-related bone loss in vivo. The SNS has been implicated in osteoporosis, but the role of
βARs in osteoclasts has never been investigated in this condition. We hypothesize that both deletion of β1AR
and β2AR, specifically in the osteoclasts, will attenuate βAR agonist-induced and aging-related bone loss in
mice. Our work will provide a more complete understanding of the role of SNS signaling in age-related bone
loss in vivo, and will lead to studies targeting specific osteoclast βARs and downstream signaling pathways for
treatment of bone diseases."

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that affects the lung in greater than 90%
of cases. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of activated CD4+ T cells in the lung and other sites
of disease activity. Evidence suggests that these T cells are intimately involved in the pathogenesis of
sarcoidosis. In the previous version of this proposal, we identified lung CD4+ T cells from HLA-DR3-expressing
Löfgren’s syndrome (LS) subjects expressing related T cell receptors (TCRs) and determined that these TCRs
recognized peptides derived from NAD-dependent protein deacetylase (NDPD) expressed in a common airborne
mold species, Aspergillus nidulans. Using HLA-DR3-NDPD tetramers and IFN-γ ELISPOT, we validated those
findings and showed that a significantly greater number of NDPD-responsive CD4+ T cells exists in the lungs of
LS subjects; thus,we have identified a potential causative agent in the genesis of LS. This study of Swedish
subjects with LS serves as a “proof of concept” for the current renewal whose focus is to identify T cell epitopes
for CD4+ T cells derived from the lungs of sarcoidosis subjects expressing HLA-DRB1*11:01, the HLA allele
strongly linked to sarcoidosis in Caucasians and African-Americans in the US. Thus, we hypothesize that
expanded CD4+ T cells in the lungs of HLA-DRB1*11:01-expressing US sarcoidosis patients are
accumulating in response to etiologic sarcoidosis antigen(s) and recognize those antigens in an HLA-
DRB1*11:01-restricted fashion. This proposal harnesses the strengths of a multidisciplinary research team
and focuses on a sarcoidosis cohort in the US. Using a single cell RT-PCR approach, Aim 1 will characterize
αβTCR pairs expressed on CD4+ T cells derived from the lungs of US sarcoidosis patients and generate
hybridomas expressing disease-relevant TCRs. The second specific aim will determine the peptides that
stimulate the CD4+ T cell hybridomas expressing the TCRs of interest. The final aim will use functional assays
and HLA-DR11-peptide tetramers to identify and enumerate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in the lungs of
sarcoidosis patients and determine if the frequency of these T cells can serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and/or
prognosis. Thus, using a novel yet proven scientific approach, we will address critical knowledge gaps in the
etiologic T cell antigens involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis in US patients, further advancing our
understanding of this enigmatic disease."

The fungus Candida albicans is a ubiquitous member of the human gut microbiota, yet also
causes mucosal disease and life-threatening disseminated infections. The research program
that I describe here seeks to understand the links between the fungus' facet as intestinal
commensal and its ability to proliferate in disparate organs. The program is built upon recent
findings from my laboratory which ¾ through systematic genetic screens conducted in mouse
models of gut colonization, oropharyngeal candidiasis and disseminated infections ¾ reveal
that fungal genetic determinants of fitness in the gut also shape the interactions of the fungus
with other tissues. The proposed study encompasses three specific directions: (i) elucidating the
mechanisms of activation and inhibition of a regulator of fungal sphingolipids which is active in
the gut and inside human neutrophils; (ii) defining the effector genes and extracellular cue(s) of
a regulator that promotes binding to intestinal mucus; and (iii) identifying C. albicans gene
products that enable the fungus to inhabit the intestinal mucus layer. The proposed research is
expected to reveal basic principles underlying the interplay between mammalian host and the
most prominent fungus residing in humans."
10896138,"Project Abstract:
Most (75%), individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are found in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where
the condition accounts for about 16% (150,000 deaths) annually of under-5 mortality. In high income
countries, evidence-based strategies to control mortality and morbidity due to SCD, reduced by 68% the
mortality of children 0 – 3 years with SCD from 1983 and 2002. This success was achieved through four
interventions: Detection of SCD as early as possible in life, through screening; aggressive prevention,
detection and treatment of fatal complications, especially infections; The use of hydroxyurea as a disease-
modifying agent; comprehensive care programs. Uganda is one of the SSA countries with a high overall
sickle cell (HbS) gene prevalence of 13%. SCD accounts for 18% of child mortality in Uganda with
estimates that 50-80% of children with the condition die before their fifth birthday. The Department of
Pediatrics & Child Health, Makerere University College of Health Sciences established a sickle cell clinic in
1968. The clinic has a sickle cell database with over 10,000 unique patient records that increases by 1000
new registrations annually. The team has developed local guidelines for management of patients with SCD,
trains students, in addition to conducting high-quality research projects and NIH funded studies. There are
however remaining challenges that include: 1) Inadequate comprehensive care to all patients that has
resulted in high burden of SCD-related morbidity and mortality. Research done in Uganda has documented
high prevalence of stroke, neurocognitive impairments, acute chest syndrome, and micro-albuminuria
among children with SCD. 2) due to a lack of a comprehensive newborn screening program, many children
are diagnosed later in life or die before diagnosis, and 3) Low use of hydroxyurea despite the findings that it
is safe and effective for use in this setting. The team at Makerere University is applying to join the Sickle
Pan-African Research Consortium (SPARCO) as one of the Collaborative Consortium new sites, with a
goal of improving the health outcomes of individuals with of SCD disease in Uganda, through
implementation of evidence-based interventions. We shall leverage the resources and lessons learnt from
NIH investments in Uganda including the H3Africa biorepository (UH2 HG007051; Joloba), MEPI project
(R24TW008886, Sewankambo) and other ongoing grants including the HEPI project (1R25TW011213-01,
Kiguli) to achieve this. The project goal will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
develop a centralized, electronic, patient consented haemoglobinopathy registry at Mulago National
Referral Sickle Cell Clinic. Aim 2: To improve SCD patient outcomes in Uganda by establishing SCD
standards of care. Aim 3: To advance SCD related research by conducting cohort studies and
implementation science studies on patients enrolled in the SCD registry; and an additional study on
additional study on the transition from pediatric to adult care by SCD adolescents. MakCHS has well-
established, efficient mechanisms for coordinating and managing research grants. By the end of this 5-year
support, we anticipate having a system to support the sustainability of high quality SCD research and
clinical care that is scalable in Uganda and SSA."
10804703,"The purpose and objectives of the training program proposed for continued support remain to prepare
bioengineers for an impactful career in orthopaedic research as part of a focused program leading to the Ph.D.
degree in Bioengineering. Training a diverse cohort of bioengineers side-by-side with orthopaedic surgeons
and life scientists at various levels of training, will continue to foster an environment conducive to research and
education in the orthopaedic arena. Indeed, this has been the formula that has been very successful in our
training program thus far and, in today's complex and interdisciplinary research world, this approach is more
essential than ever. Trainee research areas represent a wide range of musculoskeletal problems including, but
not limited to, the cellular and molecular biology of bone growth, repair, ossification, and maintenance; the
etiology and pathogenesis of tendon and ligament injury, repair, and regeneration; mechanical loading effects
on articular cartilage; and biomaterials to promote tissue repair and regeneration. In addition to formal didactic
coursework outlined in our enhanced Orthopaedic Bioengineering curriculum, training opportunities include
seminar series, journal clubs, and other enrichment and outreach activities.
 The primary participating departments in this training program are the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery
in the Perelman School of Medicine and the Department of Bioengineering in the School of Engineering and
Applied Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Both departments have grown significantly over the past
five years in terms of numbers of faculty, grant funding, and trainees.
 Six predoctoral trainees are requested in this continuation grant. It should be noted that the predoctoral
trainees work in a structured, yet flexible environment while completing course requirements toward the Ph.D.
degree in Bioengineering. Despite the fact that the Ph.D. program is typically five years in total duration,
typically, only two years, and not the first year, will be supported by this training grant so that positions can be
made available for new trainees to grow the program.
 There are three primary training sites for this training grant. The first primary site is the McKay Orthopaedic
Research Laboratory in Stemmler Hall in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, the second is the
Translational Musculoskeletal Research Center at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center, and the third is the
orthopaedic research unit in Skirkanich Hall in the Department of Bioengineering. These facilities represent
>85% of the dedicated training space for the program. Finally, it should be noted that the University of
Pennsylvania operates a large number of state-of-the-art, sophisticated core facilities that are available to
faculty and trainees."
10849642,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Institutional data from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) has uncovered that our underrepresented (UR)
undergraduate students are less likely to participate in research activities because of their lack of laboratory
training, lack of familiarity with biomedical careers upon college entry, and overall inability to volunteer their time
to research because of their need to work for pay. Despite strong research participation from our overall
undergraduate population, we are unable to garner the same representation from underrepresented minority
(URM) students, students with disabilities, or financially challenged students even though UTD is a diverse
STEM-focused, research-intensive university located in the fourth largest metropolitan area of the US. We
designed the MARC at UTD program to address our shortcomings and promote equity in biomedical research.
We anticipate a 500-1000/yr pool of STEM undergraduates who would be eligible to apply to the MARC at UTD
program. Our research strengths include imaging, computational approaches, engineering, neuroscience,
molecular biology, and entrepreneurship development aimed at scientists. The specific objectives of this three-
year (per cohort) program are to: 1) To equip a select group of carefully identified undergraduates (i.e., MARC
fellows) who do not need previous research experience with the necessary skills to thrive in a biomedical
research laboratory; 2) To financially support this cohort of select MARC fellows who would otherwise need to
work to allow them the necessary time to engage in continuous, productive biomedical research; and 3) To
provide career mentorship and professional skill development to these MARC fellows. In order to equip MARC
fellows with laboratory skills, they will initially enroll in an Introduction to Biomedical Research Skills Course. This
course will train students in techniques commonly utilized in biomedical research, in safe and ethical laboratory
practices and statistics, and in scientific communication prior to starting research. Following this, our MARC
fellows will complete biomedical research with a final objective of presenting at a national research conference,
preparation of a manuscript for publication, and successful application to a biomedical graduate program. This
extensive 2.5 years of research will include academic year research, one summer at UTD, and one summer with
an external partner. The MARC program expects to support 30 students over five years (three separate cohorts).
MARC participants will be matched with a faculty research mentor, a career mentor, and a near-peer mentor to
guide them through the various facets of scientific discovery and professional development. Of particular
importance is the creation of an individual development plan (IDP) that will fit the needs and experiences of each
participant. Upon program completion, MARC fellows will be prepared to excel in graduate research in
biomedicine."
10816493,"U-RISE at the University of North Dakota
This application seeks funding for an Undergraduate Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (U-
RISE) program at the University of North Dakota (UND). The goal for this program is to increase the number of
undergraduate, underrepresented honor students in the biomedical or bio-behavioral sciences who will go on to
successfully complete doctoral study and begin a research career. UND has high numbers of underrepresented
students enrolled in the biomedical sciences. However, a paucity of underrepresented ethnically prepared
investigators exists. Given that no U-RISE program resides in any of the Northern Plains states, the need for the
U-RISE program at UND is profound.
The objectives for the U-RISE research training program are: 1) Enroll a cohort of 4 U-RISE eligible trainees for
each of the sophomore, junior, and senior year classes in the UND U-RISE program in each year of the program;
2) Sixteen (80%) senior U-RISE trainees will graduate with a B.S. degree from the UND U-RISE program within the
2024 to 2028 timeframe; and 3) 60% of the U-RISE trainees will matriculate into MS, PhD or MD/PhD programs
within three years of graduating from UND with a BS degree; and 50% of these students will go on to earn a PhD
or MD/PhD.
Culturally responsive recruitment efforts will be used to generate a high-quality pool of perspective U-RISE
trainees. After selection, U-RISE will provide the trainees with a structured research training program that
includes: 1) Training in the Responsible Conduct for Research and Rigor and Reproducibility of Research; 2)
Coursework in the Utilization of Library Resources; Scientific Writing and Research Presentation Techniques,
Computation Methods and Statistics; 3) Mentored research experiences through matched placements in
investigators’ research laboratories; 4) Intense Summer Research Experiences in a major research lab with a T 32
equivalent research program; 5) Research-focused service learning opportunities (e.g. Science Cafes or Science
Fair judging for middle school and high school students); 6) Training and opportunities for scholarly
presentations or publications; 7) Seminars on gaining entrance into graduate studies and research courses; and
8) Planning for a Research Career. Students will meet weekly and as needed with advisors and research
mentors. It is expected that U-RISE trainees will become contributing members of their research groups as they
begin to be groomed for research careers.
All programmatic, mentor, and mentee activities will be evaluated with reports provided to the Advisory
Committee for determination of program improvement and future planning. Our goal is to have 60% of U-RISE
trainees matriculate into a MS, PhD or MD/PhD program, and 50% of these students will graduate and pursue

10834966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given the aging of the population and concerns over the physician-scientist workforce, it is imperative to
inculcate the next generation of physicians with the desire to understand and improve care for older adults
through pursuit of scientific discovery in the basic, clinical, and social sciences. The purpose of this application
is to renew support for the successful Short-Term Aging-related Research (STAR) T35 program which has
provided summer training in basic, clinical, and social science research for medical students at the Pritzker
School of Medicine to inspire and prepare them to pursue careers in aging research for the past 15 years. The
STAR T35 program supports a culture of scientific inquiry throughout the school, and inspires its trainees to
pursue additional years for research significantly more often than their peers. The proposed program will
continue to be led by Dr. David Meltzer, a physician-economist who is a member of the National Academy of
Medicine and an NIA-funded investigator, including PI of an NIA funded P30 Center on Healthy Aging
Behaviors and Longitudinal Investigations (CHABLIS), and Dr. Vineet Arora, Dean for Medical Education at
Pritzker and an NIH funded researcher who studies sleep in older persons. They will be joined by two
accomplished assistant directors, including Dr. Stacie Levine, Section Chief of Geriatrics and Palliative Care,
and Dr. Sangram Sisodia, an NIA-funded basic science researcher in Alzheimer’s disease. Building on the
established processes of the successful long-running Pritzker Summer Research Program (SRP) and the
Scholarship and Discovery (S&D) 4-year research infrastructure, we request funding to appoint ten T35
sponsored students each year with an additional ten supported by Pritzker. A cadre of nationally prominent
NIH-funded principal investigators in basic, clinical, and social science relevant to aging who together have
more than $23 million in funding will mentor individual trainees. In addition, trainees will take part in didactic
instruction in responsible conduct of research, statistics, clinical geriatrics and an innovative course called
Scholars in Translational Aging Research Training (START) Program which will expose them to concepts in
biology, clinical geriatrics, and the social sciences that are central to the study of aging. For nearly 15 years,
the START course has consistently increased interest in aging research careers among participants (both NIA
T35 funded and other). Through rigorous evaluation and long-term tracking, we will be able to determine if
participants show a greater propensity to continue pursuing research as a career. This program supports the
imperative to inculcate the next generation of physicians with the desire to understand and improve care for
older adults through pursuit of scientific discovery."
10618359,"Abstract
This is a revised competitive renewal application for a NIH R01 grant entitled “Structures and Interactions of
Chemokine Receptors” that has been continuously funded and very successful for 22 years. The long-
standing goals of this project are to understand the mechanisms of chemokines and their receptors in various
pathologies and to translate this information into the development of new intervention strategies. During the
past funding period, we have made significant progress toward these goals. Specifically, we have de novo
designed and chemically synthesized novel agonist molecules of CXCR4 receptor and completed a series of
studies to characterize their in vitro and in vivo biological activities in eliciting site-specific migration and
distribution of human neural stem cells and exerting significant and selective therapeutic effect in mice with
neurodegenerative disease. The molecular mechanisms of action of these agents have been analyzed with a
panel of point mutations at 24 residues located in each of the seven transmembrane domains of CXCR4 to
map critical sites for CXCR4-agonist recognition and signaling. To further advance these peptide agonists
toward potential therapeutics, we have developed a new strategy for peptide optimization with a small
molecule mimicry approach. A novel small molecule with potent biological activity in itself has been discovered
to mimic and to replace a large portion of the peptide agonist, resulting in a new prototype small molecule-
peptide conjugate agonist with much higher CXCR4 affinity, smaller size, and lower synthetic cost that are
advantageous for therapeutic development in the new grant period. These exciting discoveries and results
have laid a solid foundation for continuing translational research in regenerative medicine and basic research
to understand the mechanisms underlining stem cell migration and signaling."
10881947,"Abstract
Centered in the Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery at the University of Michigan Medical School, this
longstanding training program in Translational Neuroscience includes additional stakeholders across the
University. The program’s preceptors train basic scientists and clinician-scientists to conduct research in
neurological diseases across the translational continuum, from basic mechanistic work through preclinical and
clinical research. While mentored research under the direction of established investigators is the central pillar
of this program, a new “mentoring the mentor” initiative will support promising younger preceptors with
guidance from a paired senior investigator. In addition, a new mentor training program will be instituted, as
designed by the NIH-funded National Research Mentoring Network, that will benefit junior and senior mentors
alike. Our trainees’ mentored research experiences are complemented by appropriate formal education and a
Core Program designed to provide rigorous quantitative and biostatistical training, expand the trainees’
knowledge beyond their narrower research focus, and ensure successful career progression. One of the
strengths of this program is its integration of clinical and basic science training: laboratory scientists are
exposed to clinical issues via their colleagues and mentors in the program, and clinical researchers gain a
better understanding of the mechanisms of disease via their basic science exposures. Laboratory-based
research training follows a project-oriented approach, with careful mentoring by the preceptors. Trainees in
clinical science programs are able to complete a Master’s Degree, such as the School of Public Health’s
Master’s Program in Clinical Research, but a formal degree is not required of all participants. Trainees include
both biomedical PhD scientists who seek training in disease-oriented neuroscience, and clinicians – principally
neurologists and neurosurgeons - who have completed clinical training and have chosen to pursue a
laboratory-based or clinical research career. They are selected competitively by the program’s Executive
Council. The recruitment process includes a strong diversity outreach initiative connected by a bridging
program to NINDS-sponsored programs aimed at increasing diversity in Neuroscience graduate and
postgraduate student education. This training program is embedded within the University’s rich research
environment which includes a highly collegial and interdisciplinary neuroscience research community, excellent
core resources for biomedical research, and strong resources for translational and clinical research. Our prior
trainees have been very successful in moving on to and establishing productive careers in neuroscience, and
we are forced to turn away excellent applicants every year. We propose to continue our trainee number at five
postdoctoral fellows per year, with each trainee in the program for 1-2 years depending on their success in
obtaining external funding."
10867279,"Humans make rich inferences about the relationships between entities in the world from scarce information. For example, we can find a novel destination after seeing a few street numbers, or find a page in a dictionary by glancing at a few words in other pages. Theoretical considerations suggest that the brain makes such inferences by constructing ""internal models"" of the relationships in the environment (relationships between actions and states of the world), and by mentally simulating those models. However, the neural substrates and mechanisms of mental simulation are not understood. Our overarching goal is to integrate insights from theory and modeling with behavior and electrophysiology in awake, behaving monkeys to understand how mental simulation of internal models support relational inference. We will develop a behavioral task for monkeys in which they have “navigate” mentally from one stimulus to another along a one-dimensional abstract space of discrete stimuli (i.e., a sequence of images). We will assess whether animals’ behavioral characteristics exhibit hallmarks of mental simulation. We will then create a large library of neural network models to generate hypotheses for alternative computational strategies (including mental simulations) that the brain might employ for navigating abstract spaces. Next, we will record from candidate brain areas in the parietal and entorhinal cortex of monkeys, and analyze the data at single cell and population levels looking for signatures of mental simulation. Finally, we will adopt an iterative approach involving model-based data analyses and data-driven model revision with the ultimate goal of creating models that simultaneously succeed in performing task-relevant computations (i.e., behavior) and account for observed neural responses. Finally, we will validate our framework by evaluating the predictions of our models for both behavior and electrophysiology in new behavioral tasks."
10792940,"In this multi-PI R21 application, we propose to advance the anti-cancer efficacy of a tumor targeting and
cell-penetrating antibody (3E10) that directly inhibits the DNA repair factor, RAD51, and thereby suppresses
homology-directed DNA repair (HDR), sensitizes cancer cells to radiation, and is synthetically lethal to BRCA2-
and PTEN-deficient cells. We will do so by a combination of structural, biochemical, cell-based and animal
tumor studies. This proposal will leverage complementary expertise of the two PI’s in structural biology of DNA
binding proteins and macromolecular machines (Bleichert) and in DNA repair, tumor biology and pre-clinical
development of cancer therapeutics (Glazer). 3E10 was derived from a mouse model of systemic lupus
erythematosus and was initially characterized as an anti-DNA antibody that could penetrate cells and localize
in the nucleus. Our subsequent work further defined 3E10 as an inhibitor of the RAD51 recombinase via direct
binding, providing a mechanistic explanation for its effect on DNA repair. Importantly, we have also established
that 3E10 targets solid tumors in vivo in mice with extraordinarily high specificity compared to healthy tissues.
This targeting specificity is due to the mechanism of cell penetration, which depends on engagement with the
ENT2 transporter, which is highly over-expressed in human cancers compared to healthy tissues, and the
presence of extracellular DNA in the tumor microenvironment, which promotes 3E10 interaction with ENT2.
 The ability of 3E10 to target tumors and directly penetrate cells and nuclei distinguishes it from all other
antibodies currently approved for cancer therapy; as such, 3E10 potentially represents a totally new class of
cancer therapy agents. In recent work studying variants of 3E10 with specific amino acid substitutions, we
have discovered that the DNA binding, cell penetration, and tumor targeting properties of 3E10 are separable
from RAD51 binding. This has led us to hypothesize that it should be possible to generate variants of 3E10 that
have increased RAD51 binding affinity while retaining the cell penetration and tumor targeting properties. We
further hypothesize that such a 3E10 variant would be an even more potent RAD51 inhibitor and a superior
anti-cancer agent for DNA repair inhibition, radiation sensitization and synthetic lethal approaches. With
increased synthetic lethality against BRCA2- and PTEN-deficient cancers, such a second-generation antibody
would be particularly useful against the wide range of human cancers in which these factors are deficient.
 In this application, we propose to conduct structural studies of the 3E10 antibody to gain insight into the
molecular basis of its DNA binding and RAD51 inhibition. This work will guide the design of novel 3E10
variants that will be tested for DNA binding, cell penetration, RAD51 inhibition, synthetic lethality, and tumor
targeting, with the goal of identifying an optimized second-generation antibody to advance for clinical
development. Consequently, the proposed work has a very high potential for translation into the clinic and
could have a direct and substantial impact on human health."
10849670,"Bone loss and impairment in energy metabolism with aging prevalently lead to fractures and diabetes. As an
organ, the skeleton is one of the largest consumers of energy needed for bone remodeling and maintenance of
bone homeostasis. Bone remodeling is under control of osteocytes, which constitute 90-95% of bone cells, and
which bioenergetic program is largely unknown. New evidence indicates that nuclear receptor PPARG, which
is a global regulator of energy metabolism and pharmacological target to treat hyperglycemia, regulates
osteocyte energy metabolism and their function including production of sclerostin, an inhibitor of WNT pathway
activity and a key protein regulating bone remodeling. Research proposed in this application will provide an
insight into the connection between osteocyte bioenergetics, its function in bone metabolism and systemic
energy metabolism, and whether bone acts as the body “energostat” via osteocyte endocrine activities. The
leading hypothesis is that changes in PPARG activity with aging alter osteocyte function and bioenergetics
resulting in simultaneous decrease in bone formation and decrease in energy metabolism. This hypothesis will
be tested in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how fuel choice and aging affect osteocyte function and
whether these processes are PPARG dependent. With the use of aged C57BL/6 and γOTKO mice, bone organ
cultures, and osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells with down-regulated PPARG, in combination with transcriptomics,
quantitative proteomics, and coculture experiments, PPARG contribution to osteocyte aging will be defined.
Aim 2 will contrast the PPARG protein interactome of osteocytes with the interactome of adipocytes, in
response to either full agonist rosiglitazone or the inverse agonist SR10171, in order to define an optimal
PPARG modulator for its beneficial effects on bone and metabolism. The analysis will be done on osteocyte-
like MLO-Y4 cells using quantitative Tandem Mass Tag Proteomics. Aim 3 will define dynamics of PPARG
interactome on PPRE sequences present in Sost promoter as a function of aging and in response to
pharmacological modulation of PPARG activity. The premise of this application is to set a stage for precise
pharmacologic manipulation with PPARG activities in osteocytes to simultaneously improve skeletal and
metabolic dysfunction in elderly."

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are the most common medical condition affecting pregnancy and a
leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the Unites States. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
increase lifetime cardiac disease risk in women and infants exposed during pregnancy and are considered an
independent, gender-specific cardiovascular risk factor by the American Heart Association. Current
interventions to prevent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are extremely limited and minimally effective.
Mindfulness-based interventions hold significant promise as a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; mindfulness-based interventions significantly reduce blood pressure in
adults with hypertension and prehypertension. However, prenatal clinical trials of mindfulness-based
interventions have excluded women at risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy from participating, and
have not examined effects of mindfulness on maternal cardiovascular parameters. Our pilot RCT of prenatal
mindfulness training for women at risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy demonstrated medium to large
effects on maternal cardiovascular parameters of risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including lower
ambulatory blood pressure and accelerated fetal growth velocity. However, the mechanisms explaining effects
of prenatal mindfulness training on indicators of risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are unknown.
Building upon these promising preliminary findings, the proposed RCT will harness subjective and objective
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodologies (in vivo repeated assessments) in combination with
wearable biosensor technology to capture rich epochs of ecologically-valid psychological (Aim 1), physiological
(Aim 2), and interpersonal (Aim 3) processes through which mindfulness training may lead to improved
maternal cardiovascular parameters and reduced risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. N=150
pregnant women at risk for HDP will be randomized to an 8-week phone-delivered mindfulness intervention or
usual care. For every participant, we will measure maternal cardiovascular parameters (24-hour blood
pressure and uterine artery resistance values by ultrasound Doppler) before and after the RCT. All participants
will complete EMA for 2 weeks ‘bursts’ before and after the RCT to evaluate mechanisms of mindfulness
training on maternal cardiovascular parameters. EMA will include smartphone-app based experience sampling
of psychological processes; smartphone-app based ambient audio sampling (i.e. the Electronically Activated
Recorder [EAR] method) and wearable wrist-worn biosensor monitoring (heart rate and heart rate variability) of
physiological responses to everyday experiences. Results will provide new insights into 1) effects of
mindfulness training on cardiovascular parameters in pregnancy, 2) pathophysiological mechanisms of
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and 3) new targets for prevention strategies."
10841582,"Project Summary
Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor and the major acyl group carrier in mammalian cells. CoA plays a
central and regulatory role in energy metabolism, as its acyl-CoA derivatives are substrates for hundreds of
metabolic reactions and the posttranslational modification of histones and key metabolic enzymes. CoA-
dependent processes occur in multiple subcellular compartments, and major pools of CoA are found in the
mitochondria, peroxisomes and cytosol. At the whole tissue level, the concentration of CoA is tightly regulated
and dynamically adjusted to changes in the metabolic state. The importance of such a tight control over CoA
levels is underscored by the fact that genetic manipulations that force the concentration of CoA outside of its
homeostatic range result in loss of metabolic regulation and organ function. For example, the inability to increase
CoA levels during a fast blunts fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis in the liver, causing fasting
hypoglycemia. On the other hand, an abnormally high concentration of CoA in skeletal muscle is associated with
decreased muscle mass, ATP levels and exercise performance, highlighting the importance of mechanisms that
prevent the accumulation of this cofactor to toxic levels. The concentration of CoA is regulated by balancing its
synthesis and degradation. The process of CoA degradation is poorly characterized. Furthermore, the
mechanisms that regulate the different subcellular CoA pools are incompletely understood. During the previous
funding cycle, we have characterized the biochemical and regulatory properties of two CoA-degrading enzymes,
Nudt7 and Nudt19, which reside in liver and kidney peroxisomes, respectively. Our published and unpublished
observations support the conclusion that these enzymes regulate peroxisomal lipid metabolism. Furthermore,
deletion of Nudt19 leads to the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA in the kidneys, suggesting a
connection to cholesterol synthesis. We also identified the first mammalian CoA-degrading enzyme, Nudt8,
which resides in the mitochondria, and we have recently generated Nudt8-/- mice. The existence of CoA-
degrading enzymes in both peroxisomes and mitochondria suggests that these enzymes contribute to the
regulation of the CoA pools within these organelles. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand
the mechanisms that regulate tissue CoA levels and to harness them to manipulate the metabolic network for
the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders. To move toward this goal, we propose to 1) determine the
mechanisms through which Nudt19 regulates kidney lipid metabolism and kidney function and 2) determine the
role played by Nudt8 in the regulation of the mitochondrial CoA pool and mitochondrial metabolism. This research
program will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the peroxisomal and mitochondrial
CoA pools. Furthermore, identifying the processes regulated by each CoA-degrading enzyme will aid in the
development of strategies to target and correct specific CoA-dependent pathways in metabolic disorders."

capacity is adjusted to meet cellular demand. It is important to understand how cells regulate this adjustment as
many stress conditions occur upon aging and in human diseases, like neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
Diverse cellular responses have been observed depending on the type of stress, and the overarching goal of
this proposal is to gain mechanistic insight into different proteasome responses following stress. The
upregulation of proteasomes is one such response, which not only involves transcriptional regulation, but also
the assembly of newly synthesized subunits in proteasome complexes. A surprising complexity exists in early
steps of assembly where it is unclear how various proteasome associated factors, like Pba1-Pba2/PAC1-PAC2,
Fub1/PI31, and Blm10/PA200, contribute to sequential steps or parallel pathways of the assembly process.
Understanding these pathways is a focus of this proposal because it impacts the amount and type of
proteasomes that form and thereby the cells' degradative capacity. The relocalization of proteasomes is another
stress response which involves either cytosolic condensate formation or autophagic targeting (proteaphagy).
Condensate formation occurs via liquid-liquid phase separation and functions to store proteasomes, protect them
from proteaphagy, or concentrate them with substrates in degradation centers. The formation of such
condensates generally depends on the formation of multivalent interactions. The interactions that drive this
process for the proteasome, however, are not well understood. To gain new insights into the process, the
proposed research will utilize newly identified conditions and factors that regulate proteasome condensates in
yeast. Finally, the proposal will test the hypothesis that under conditions of limited proteasome capacity,
proteasomes prioritize the degradation of certain substrates over others. This is an original and important
concept that will be analyzed using in vivo degradation assays. The goal is to determine how proteasome-
associated proteins contribute to this prioritization.
 The proteasome responses to stress have been described in yeast as well as human cells, indicating
evolutionary conserved responses that are intricately connected to various cellular processes and changing
conditions. Using both budding yeast and mammalian tissue culture, the biochemical and cell biological assays
proposed here will provide original and new insights into the processes that determine the levels, composition,
and substrate prioritization of proteasomes in the cell. Such insights will provide fundamental knowledge about
these important cellular complexes and create a foundation for efforts to identify targets and drugs that increase
or decrease proteasome levels and localized activity in cells. The ability to manipulate proteasome in vivo has
been shown to be of therapeutic value."
10762450,"ABSTRACT
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals”, are emerging contaminants of
concern due to their prevalence (in 99% of blood samples in the U.S.), long half-life, and adverse health effects
in humans. PFAS can be released, mobilized, and redistributed in the environment during emergencies such as
fires, industrial incidents, hurricanes, and flooding, thus enhancing human exposures and health effects. A major
challenge associated with these emergencies is protecting vulnerable populations including first responders,
frontline personnel, and communities at the impacted sites. There is a critical need for the development of
practical strategies to minimize dietary exposures to PFAS from drinking water and food, which account for 90%
of human exposures. Mitigation strategies using edible sorbents in the diet are safe for human consumption. The
long-term goal is to establish therapeutic sorbent interventions that will reduce oral and inhalation exposures to
complex environmental contaminants and microbes. The overall objective of this project is to develop edible,
multicomponent sorbents that will effectively reduce PFAS exposures from the diet. In this project, six
representative PFAS and their mixtures have been selected for complementary in vitro, in silico, and in vivo
studies. In Aim 1, multicomponent sorbents including processed and nutrient-amended clays will be derived from
materials that are naturally occurring, or generally recognized as safe. The in vitro adsorption studies will be
conducted in simulated gastrointestinal tract models to characterize surface interactions. The detoxification
efficacy of sorbent treatment will be validated in mammalian cell models and a living organism (Hydra vulgaris).
In Aim 2, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, energetic analysis, minimalistic MD simulations, and data-driven
models will be used to study complex systems containing mixtures of PFAS and multicomponent sorbents.
Computational studies will validate sorption mechanisms and thermodynamics and integrate with Aim 1 for
sorbent selection and characterization. In Aim 3, the efficacy and safety of selected sorbents will be tested in
vivo. Male and pregnant female rats will be exposed to PFAS and sorbents will be included in the diet at varying
doses for 3 weeks. The 3 sorbents that most effectively reduce the PFAS bioavailability and show no interference
with nutrients will be included in a 6-month safety study. Parameters to be determined include 1) PFAS
bioavailability in blood, urine, and breast milk, 2) nutrient levels, 3) body weight, relative organ-to-body weight,
and infant birth weight, 4) feed conversion efficiency, and 5) clinical blood biochemistry. It is expected that
therapeutic sorbents developed in this research will be field-practical and easily delivered orally to neutralize
PFAS mixtures from dietary exposures to protect and treat vulnerable populations during emergencies."
10748402,"The accumulation of oligomeric tau (oTau) is known to drive the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders. We recently discovered that oTau functions as part of the translational stress response, forming a complex with methylated RNA (N6-methyl adenosine, m6A) through adapter proteins, such as HNRNPA2B1, which is itself a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. m6A is known to regulate RNA degradation and utilization, and the m6A modification is “read” by adapter proteins. This complex accumulates in stress granules along with other RNA binding proteins (RBPs), many of which are also risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. We observe a strong increase of m6A in AD which highlights the importance of epi-transcriptomics in AD. The m6A pathway provides a powerful new path to elucidate mechanisms of neurodegeneration. The m6A axis also provides an innovative, putative therapeutic target for AD because our studies using an iPSC-based model of AD show that reducing m6A levels reduces tau pathology and delays disease progression, suggesting returning m6A to basal levels is beneficial. Multiple stresses (e.g., β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, AD risk genes, vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and aging) converge to drive the pathophysiology of AD. Analyzing stress responses through the lens of RNA metabolism and the translational stress response provides a vast tool of molecules for elucidating the stress response in AD. Some RBPs, such as TIA1, HRNPA2B1, and tau appear to be required for responses to synaptic stress, while other RBPs, such as FUS, appear to respond mostly to genotoxic damage. Many RBPs exhibit genetic changes that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, which emphasizes their disease relevance. The m6A tag links RBPs with RNA metabolism. Sequencing m6A labeled transcripts provides an additional powerful approach to identify the particular m6A labeled RNA species that respond to stresses and disease. Transcripts showing particularly large disease-related changes in m6A could provide the basis for new disease biomarkers or represent potential targets for disease-modifying gene therapy. We hypothesize that increases in m6A occur early in the disease course in response to tau pathology, enhance the translational stress response and accelerate neurodegeneration. The studies below will determine which molecular and pathological changes correlate most closely with m6A levels, and which show the most dynamic response to m6A reduction. Aim 1 will determine how the m6A transcriptome over the disease course in mouse models of AD/ADRD, examining both coding and non-coding RNA. Aim 2 will determine how the m6A transcriptome varies by disease severity and type in human pathological cases. Aim 3 will determine how m6A contributes to the pathophysiology of tau and neurodegeneration in AD."
10934601,"Recent research advances have led to detailed understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and development of new and emerging disease-modifying therapies. Yet effective treatment remains elusive.
Consensus in the field has focused attention on early-stage disease (preclinical AD) that begins with clinically
silent accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain long before onset of cognitive symptoms. Early detection of
preclinical AD is now recognized as a critical prerequisite for effective and enduring AD treatment. Aβ is an
accepted “gold standard” AD biomarker. Currently available methods to assess Aβ burden rely on positron
emission tomography (PET) brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. These methods are expensive,
invasive, cumbersome, not widely available, and difficult to scale. The NIA has prioritized development of new,
safe, sensitive, cost-efficient, noninvasive technology for point-of-care early AD detection. This project addresses
this unmet need by accelerating testing of an innovative FDA Breakthrough Device-designated combination
drug-device eye scanner (Aftobetin-Sapphire II) that detects AD-related Aβ in the lens. This novel approach is
based on our discovery of AD-specific Aβ lens pathology in patients with pathologically-confirmed AD, but not
other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases or normal aging. Moreover, we found that AD-related pathologies and
phenotypes are expressed much earlier in lens than brain. These findings spurred development of the Sapphire
II system lens Aβ scanner that combines a topically-applied fluorescent Aβ-binding tracer ligand (Aftobetin) and
a purpose-designed eye scanner with integrated fluorescent lifetime decay spectroscopy analyzer that reliably
measures Aβ in the lens with high specificity, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratio. Our preliminary data shows
that lens Aβ differentiates mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical AD from normal controls with comparable
or greater sensitivity and specificity than amyloid-PET brain scans. This project leverages the longitudinal Clinical
Core cohort, NIA-funded Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (BUADRC; P30AG-072978)
BUADRC Clinical Core cohort participants undergo annual NACC-compliant comprehensive examinations. This
project proposes to add lens Aβ measurements using the Sapphire II-Aftobetin system for early AD detection
and longitudinal monitoring. In Aim 1, we will evaluate cross-sectional associations between lens Aβ burden, AD
clinical outcomes, and established ATN biomarkers (Aβ, tau, neurodegeneration; ATN framework). In Aim 2, we
will evaluate longitudinal associations between lens Aβ burden, AD clinical outcomes, and the same ATN
biomarkers (as in Aim 1). In Aim 3, we will conduct comparative clinicopathological correlation analysis of ex vivo
Aβ burden and amyloid ultrastructural pathology in postmortem brain and lens from BUADRC participants,
including those scanned during life. We anticipate that project results will identify lens Aβ diagnostic cut-points
and accelerate introduction of the Sapphire II-Aftobetin system to evaluate AD risk, detect preclinical AD, and
assess early AD and progression in individual patients."
10809751,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remains a major obstacle to improving outcomes in hematopoietic
cell transplant (HCT) recipients. There is a paucity of biomarkers that could identify patients before the
development of the disease. Genetic markers of cGVHD identified by the genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), which do not interrogate GM (γ marker) alleles, have not been replicated. There is excellent rationale
for the involvement of immunoglobulin GM genes in the etiopathogenesis of cGVHD. GM alleles modulate an
immunoevasion strategy of cytomegalovirus (CMV), a frequent viral infection after HCT, which, despite
improvements in antiviral therapies, can lead to life-threatening CMV disease in ~10 % of HCT recipients. CMV
expresses three decoy Fcg receptors (FcgRs), which interfere with Fc-mediated effector functions, such as
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potent host immunosurveillance mechanism against viruses.
Interestingly, GM alleles modulate this viral strategy: IgG antibodies expressing different GM alleles bind
differentially to the decoy FcgRs. GM genes also contribute to the interindividual differences in the magnitude
of humoral immunity to CMV. Furthermore, GM genes have been implicated in the immunobiology of
scleroderma, an autoimmune disease whose clinical features resemble that of cGVHD. Based on these
observations—and the results of our preliminary studies that showed higher levels of antibodies to CMV UL70
in non-cGVHD subjects than in those with cGVHD—we hypothesize that GM alleles and antibody responses to
CMV proteins are prognostic markers for cGVHD. The following specific aims will test our hypothesis: (1)
Determine if the distribution of GM alleles differs significantly between cGVHD and non-cGVHD
patients. Serum/plasma samples from HCT recipients who developed cGVHD and from those who did not—
obtained from the BMT CTN 0201 participants—will be genotyped for several GM alleles. We will determine
whether the alleles of the highly polymorphic GM loci serve as prognostic genetic markers of cGVHD; (2)
Determine if the magnitude of anti-CMV (UL70) antibody responses differs significantly between
cGVHD and non-cGVHD patients, and if GM alleles contribute to the interindividual differences in these
responses. The results of our preliminary studies suggest that anti-UL70 antibodies might play a protective
role in the development of cGVHD. It is important to replicate this finding in an independent study population.
We will measure the level of anti-UL70 antibodies in BMT CTN 0201 specimens and determine if the level of
these antibodies is influenced by GM alleles. There is high likelihood that the results of this investigation will
identify much-needed prognostic markers for cGVHD. Furthermore, they may provide targets for
immunotherapy of this disease. Recent studies from a murine model of HCT show that CMV reactivation can
be prevented by the infusion of strain-specific anti-CMV antibodies. Perhaps infusion of monoclonal anti-UL70
antibodies could similarly prevent CMV reactivation, a life-threatening complication in some HCT recipients."
10918047,"Project Summary/Abstract
In eukaryotes, chromatin replication is responsible for the transmission of genetic and epigenetic information
between daughter cells. Interfering with this process can lead to genetic and/or epigenetic mutations, which are
both causative for many human diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Although
epigenetic features like histone variants, histone modifications and DNA methylation need to be properly copied
during chromatin replication, they also serve important roles in regulating DNA replication itself, as well as other
cellular processes occurring simultaneously like transcription and DNA repair. Our research group seeks to
understand the contribution of epigenetic information in regulating these processes during chromatin replication.
We are particularly interested in the roles played by conserved histone H3 variants in maintaining genomic and
epigenomic stability. Recently, we demonstrated that the replication-dependent histone H3.1 variant, which is
conserved in all multicellular organisms, directly regulates TSK/TONSL-mediated DNA repair to resolve stalled
and broken replication forks. This discovery revealed the first protein domain (the tetratricopeptide domain of
TSK/TONSL) that can “read” H3.1 to mediate a specific function at chromatin (i.e., DNA repair). One of our goals
over the next five years is to understand the impact of the H3.1-TSK/TONSL pathway in protecting the genome
against replication-associated mutations. We are also interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by
which TSK/TONSL initiates homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair during replication. Another related
goal is to uncover and functionally characterize other proteins that are regulated by the conserved H3.1 variant.
Finally, we aim to explore if the H3.1-TSK/TONSL interaction plays additional roles during chromatin replication
aside from DNA repair. The proposed research will reveal novel functions for histone H3 variants. In the long
term, our work will provide a better understanding of the multiple roles played by chromatin-based molecular
mechanisms in promoting the maintenance of genetic and epigenetic information. Protecting this information
during replication is critical for proper development in multicellular eukaryotes, and for preventing the occurrence
and accumulation of mutations that can negatively affect human health."

The environment is a primary determinant of bacterial growth and behavior. It impacts not only metabolism and
growth rate, but also morphology, development, and antibiotic susceptibility. Our research centers on the
essential processes that coordinate cell growth and cell cycle progression with the environment. In bacteria
these processes are critical, maximizing proliferative potential across a wide physicochemical landscape.
Defects in these processes can be catastrophic, impairing growth, reducing viability, and rendering cells
hypersensitive to antimicrobials. The increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens provides a
powerful motivation for our work. Understanding how bacteria adapt to the physicochemical environment
should reveal novel approaches for the treatment of bacterial pathogens and identify targets for the
development of next-generation therapeutics. In this this effort we employ evolutionarily distinct organisms
including two Gram-negative Gammaproteobacteria: the model organism Escherichia coli and the pathogen
Klebsiella pneumoniae. In 2019 K. pneumoniae was the third leading cause of global deaths due to or
associated with antibiotic resistance (Lancet, 2022).
 The cell envelope is vital to bacterial viability, required as both a permeability barrier and a buttress
against turgor pressure. Exposed to the environment, essential cell envelope processes must remain functional
across a large range of conditions. Understanding the factors that underlie and preserve cell envelope integrity
is a primary research focus. Extending our finding that functional redundancy amongst E. coli cell wall
enzymes ensures robust growth across pH values, we will use single molecule techniques and biochemistry to
illuminate the impact of pH on the activity of individual PBP transpeptidases in situ. These enzymes play a
critical role in peptidoglycan cross linking and are the target of beta-lactam antibiotics. We will also identify
factors underlying pH-mediated changes in cell wall synthase activity and beta-lactam resistance in K.
pneumoniae. As part of a broader effort to understand the mechanisms coordinating cell envelope biogenesis
with cell growth and cell cycle progression, we will elucidate the essential role of the outer membrane
component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in E. coli biology. Finally, building on our longstanding interest in the
relationship between nutrient availability and cell morphology, we will characterize the mechanisms governing
a newly identified starvation-mediated stress response, cytoplasmic condensation, and identify the effector(s)
responsible for the positive relationship between the starvation-associated alarmone, ppGpp, and cell division.
 We are aided in these endeavors by our multidisciplinary approach that employs a diverse array of
techniques, as well as an extensive network of close colleagues and collaborators with whom we enjoy a free
exchange of reagents and ideas. These advantages allow us to answer previously intractable questions in
physiology and homeostatic control that are relevant to organisms throughout the tree of life."

 This is a resubmission of a competitive renewal application for a Cardiovascular Research Training
Program (CRTP) that was established 27 years ago at the University of New Mexico (UNM). It has served to
provide opportunities for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees from underrepresented backgrounds to gain
research training in cardiovascular biology. This grant has also been a catalyst for the development of an
integrated program of research and training in cardiovascular sciences at UNM. The CRTP has bridged the
basic and clinical sciences and has fostered new productive collaborations between disciplines. This area of
research and training emphasis has particular relevance to the state of New Mexico where the incidence of
cardiovascular-related disease is high, especially in the Hispanic and Native American populations.
 During the tenure of the grant, several new programs have evolved that unify research in the
cardiovascular sciences at the UNM Health Sciences Center (HSC), including the formation of the Vascular
Physiology Group with researchers from the School of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy. In addition,
since the initial funding of the award, the UNM HSC has identified signature research programs including one
focused on Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease (CVMD). This area of research receives special funds from
the Office of Research to support pilot studies and to enhance collaborative projects between its members. All
of the mentors on this grant are members of this signature program with a key member of the T32 serving as
the leader of the CVMD program. Collaborative research is also facilitated by the structure of the Biomedical
Sciences Graduate Program that offers a unified training environment within the UNM HSC. The graduate
program is non-departmental and provides interdisciplinary training over a broad base of biomedical science in
the first year, followed by in-depth training in the chosen discipline.
 The goals of the current application are to build upon the existing framework and continue to improve our
success in research training, career development, retention, and recruitment of URM scientists. To foster this
latter objective, we have designed recruitment strategies that seek to improve integration of our program with
existing minority-based undergraduate programs at UNM and partner institutions in the region. We will also
promote collaborations with clinician scientists in the Clinical and Translational Sciences Center (CTSC) to
provide new opportunities for training in translational research. Leaders of the CTSC are mentors on this T32
and will help to coordinate research opportunities in the CTSC for both pre- and post-doctoral trainees.
 Twenty-five productive and collaborative faculty members from both basic science and clinical departments
will serve as faculty mentors. The CRTP will continue to support six predoctoral and two postdoctoral positions
per year. Planned appointment durations are 2-3 years for predoctoral students and 2 years for postdoctoral
trainees, with subsequent support provided by individual training fellowships or mentored career awards."

Our ultimate goal is to develop a multimodal VIS-OCT platform for retinal imaging to improve patient care and to
advance clinical research. We proposed to develop a visible-light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT)
platform for multimodal multifunctional imaging of the retina. Two novel VIS-OCT based imaging technologies
will be built in this platform: quantitative fundus autofluorescence (FAF) or VIS-OCT-FAF, and retinal nerve fiber
layer (RNFL) spectral contrast OCT or DUAL-OCT-RNFL. The two new technologies will add new tools for
ophthalmologists to make early diagnosis and better monitor retinal diseases. The proposed work is based on
hypotheses that are strongly supported by our theoretical modeling and solid preliminary data. We hypothesize
that 1) Quantification of absolute FAF intensity can be achieved by normalizing raw FAF signals with an
internal reference and an external standard fluorescence reference; 2) RPE OCT signals
simultaneously acquired with FAF can serve as an internal reference; and 3) The spectral contrast of
the RNFL can be used as a biomarker for RNFL damage by elevated IOP. Three Specific Aims are
proposed. Aim 1: To develop a VIS-OCT platform for VIS-OCT-FAF and DUAL-OCT-RNFL imaging. We will
develop and refine the VIS-OCT platform consisting of a VIS-OCT centered at 480 nm, a NIR-OCT centered at
840 nm, and a FAF detection module. A reference target with known fluorescence efficiency and reflectance
placed in the intermediate retinal imaging plane will serve as a reference to normalize raw data to obtain absolute
FAF intensity and quantitative RNFL spectral reflectance. The reference target will use a PMMA slide stained
with A2E as fluorescent molecule. We will introduce the A2E equivalent unit (AEU) as a measure of FAF. Aim 2:
To study VIS-OCT-FAF and DUAL-OCT-RNFL imaging in phantom and animals. We will test the system in
phantom and animals to verify the capabilities of the VIS-OCT platform, to calibrate and obtain feedback for
fine-tuning the hardware and algorithms. Phantom studies will use a model eye with A2E, melanosome and TiO2
to simulate lipofuscin, absorption and scattering in RPE. FAF images from albino and pigmented rats of different
ages will be studied. A2E in each imaged eye will be quantified by mass-spectroscopy to verify the accuracy of
FAF signals. Elevated IOP will be induced on rats by photocoagulation to the trabecular meshwork. RNFL
spectral contrast images from eyes with or without increased IOP will be compared. Aim 3: To study
VIS-OCT-FAF and DUAL-OCT-RNFL imaging in human subjects. Our ultimate goal is to develop a
multimodal VIS-OCT platform for retinal imaging to improve patient care and to advance clinical research.
Studies in this Aim will allow us to learn how the systems behave in a real clinical setting. We will image normal
subjects of 6 age groups to establish age-based normative data. Patients with early dry AMD and Stargardt’s
disease will also be studied. In the RNFL imaging studies, we will image 6 age groups of normal individuals to
establish age-based normative data. Patients with early stage glaucoma will be studied."
10840332,"Computational modeling of genetic variations by multi-omics integration to decipher personal genome
A person’s genome typically contains millions of genetic variants. Understanding these variants by assessing
their functional impact on a person’s phenotype, is currently of great interest in human genetics and precision
medicine. Though Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) studies have
successfully identified variants associated with traits or molecular phenotypes, most of them are in noncoding
regions and hampered by linkage disequilibrium, making the identification and interpretation of casual variants
difficult. Moreover, most of these discoveries are common variants, however, rare and individual-specific variants
in personal genome are underexplored. Understanding these variants will not only explain the missing heritability
from GWAS but also improve the precision medicine. Recently, the advent and popularity of whole genome
sequencing (WGS) and paired multi-omics functional assays provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify
rare and individual-specific casual variants. However, the sample sizes of most WGS studies are modest
compared to GWAS, making the WGS analysis particularly challenging. Nevertheless, statistical and
computational methods for analyzing WGS are underdeveloped. Given these challenges and my unique multi-
disciplinary training, the overall goals of my research program are to develop a novel class of machine learning,
statistical and system biology approaches for the identification, prioritization and interpretation of noncoding
variants by integrating GWAS, WGS and multi-omics functional assays, which will empower precision medicine
by identifying individualized biomarkers for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, in the next
five years, my lab will (i) develop a novel transfer learning approach to improve the prediction of noncoding
casual variants using multi-dimensional omics features (ii) develop a multi-omics integrated omnibus scan test
to improve the identification of rare casual variants from whole-genome sequencing data (iii) develop an
integrative computational framework for scoring impact of noncoding variants in personal genome (iv) develop a
novel class of multi-trait methods to improve phenotype prediction using whole-genome genetic variations.
In
the meantime, supported by Indiana University Precision Health Initiative, we will apply the methodologies to
different studies from Indiana Alzheimer’s Disease Center and Indiana Multiple Myeloma Biobank for novel
scientific findings. We will work close with collaborated geneticists and clinician-scientists to interpret the
discoveries. Importantly, we will work with experimental labs to validate the findings. In line with our previous
work, we will continue to make all developed methods into open-source software tools that are accessible and
useful to the biomedical research community."

The primary goal of this R01 is to determine the computational and functional role of endogenous opioids in
specific dorsal midbrain nuclei on motivated behaviors. The preponderance of mental illness in the United States
results in tens of millions of dollars in healthcare costs. While many neuropsychiatric conditions can be
dissociated based on the presence or absence of specific features, a common theme across mental illnesses is
the dysregulation of affective or motivated behaviors. The endogenous opioid system is known to powerfully
modulate affective and motivational neural circuits. Historically, dorsal midbrain nuclei (including ventrolateral
periaqueductal gray nucleus and the adjacent dorsal raphe nucleus) have been shown to be important sites for
opioid action. More recently, the lateral dorsal raphe nucleus subregion (LDRN) and nucleus accumbens were
shown to be important sites in an opioid-mediated mesolimbic circuit of appetitive motivation. However, while
downstream opioid activity in this LDRNaccumbens circuit specifically enhances appetitive motivation,
convergent studies indicate that endogenous opioids may play a motivationally suppressive role within LDRN
itself. For example, experiments in the 1980s demonstrated morphine microinjections into ventrolateral
PAG/LDRN could suppress food intake. Correspondingly, pilot studies in our lab using a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated
knockdown of opioid peptides oppositely facilitated food intake. Furthermore, local LDRN opioid activity appears
to suppress both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors (e.g., local opioid antagonism in LDRN increases
defensive or escape behaviors). These broad, anti-motivational opioid effects suggest that dysregulation could
affect a wide range of affective or motivated behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this R01 application is to determine
how endogenous opioids regulate appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors in LDRN by multiplexing genetic,
pharmacological, in vivo imaging, and optogenetic technologies. First, we will identify the anatomical
characteristics of opioids within dorsal midbrain nuclei (Aim 1). In tandem we will test the functional localization
of opioids by performing receptor selective pharmacological antagonism via wireless fluidic devices and
CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown of opioid peptides. Next, we will use dual-color 1-photon endoscopic imaging to
examine how local opioidergic and non-opioidergic neurons interact to encode appetitive and aversive behaviors
(Aim 2). Follow up experiments will use simultaneous 1-photon imaging with cell-type selective optogenetic
neuromodulation to augment or disrupt LDRN encoding and expression of motivated behaviors. Finally, we will
multiplex 1-photon imaging, CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown, and cell-type specific optogenetic stimulation to
determine how endogenous opioid peptides casually augment LDRN encoding and expression of motivated
behaviors (Aim 3). Together, these studies may provide insights into how neuropsychiatric disorders are often
characterized by affective and motivational dysregulation, and suggest specific neurochemical targets for
therapeutic intervention."

 The circadian clock, critical to human health and drug metabolism, regulates rhythmic protein production
and thus cell function and metabolism. Many proteins whose levels show robust circadian rhythms are produced
from mRNAs that are not rhythmic. Using the model eukaryote Neurospora crassa, we found that up to half of
this circadian regulation of protein levels is through clock control of the activities of a conserved regulator of
translation initiation (eIF2α), and the protein composition of translating ribosomes. We also made the surprising
observation that the circadian clock controls the probability that ribosomes will read through the normal stop
codon to produce proteins with carboxy-terminal extensions and potentially new functions. In addition, we found
that the clock regulates the levels of tRNA synthetases that charge tRNAs with the appropriate amino acids for
translation, and thus are critical for accurate protein synthesis. Over the next 5 years, we will capitalize on these
findings to test the exciting hypothesis that the circadian clock controls daily changes in translation fidelity and
thus protein diversity beyond what is encoded for in the genome. We will determine if clock control of ribosome
composition is necessary, and which specific ribosomal proteins are required, for rhythmic stop codon
readthrough. In addition, we will test if circadian clock control of binding of the co-chaperone Zuotin to ribosomes
regulates daily rhythms in protein folding. We will determine the impact of circadian rhythms in methionyl-tRNA
synthetase (MetRS) levels, and rhythms in the activities of kinases that phosphorylate MetRS, on three different
MetRS regulatory pathways. These include translation initiation through charging of the initiator methionyl tRNA,
translation elongation through charging of elongator methionyl tRNA, and misincorporation of methionine during
protein synthesis through the mischarging of non-cognate tRNA. This work will significantly impact our
understanding of both how a cell is different at different times of the day, and how the proteome can be more
diverse than what one would predict from the genome sequence."

Treatment options are limited and prognosis is poor for patients with recurrent or metastatic sarcoma. Both soft
tissue sarcoma and osteosarcoma most frequently metastasize to the lungs and are often resistant to cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Novel treatment options such as immune therapy are urgently needed for long-term control and
elimination of metastatic disease. In that regard, both T cell (CAR-T and TILs) therapy and immune checkpoint
blocking therapy have advanced to clinical applications in other types of tumors. In fact, wildtype IL12-armed T
(CAR- or TIL) cells is more powerful in eliminating tumors than T cells alone in both preclinical tumor model or
clinical trial because IL12 polarize T cells to the Th1 phenotype, boost effector T cells, downregulate
angiogenesis, remodel the extracellular matrix, and alter levels of immune-suppressive cytokines. One urgent
challenge for either CAR-T or wildtype IL12-armed T cell therapy is adverse effects. The CAR-T cells causes
severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and wildtype IL12 causes liver toxicity.
To safely use IL12, the key is to target the IL12 gene and its transcribed/translated gene product to the tumor.
To that end, we have invented a novel tumor-targeted IL12 gene (ttIL12 or CHP-IL12) that encodes the p35
subunit and p40-VNTANST fusion subunit. This first generation of ttIL12 received US issued
patent(US9657077B2). Different from wildtype IL12, ttIL12 therapy is also more effective in reducing myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and FoxP3Tregs. High levels of MDSC and FoxP3 expression are
associated with poor survival amongst sarcoma patients.
To address the adverse effect of T cells, the applicant has invented the second generation of ttIL12 therapy—
cell membrane anchored ttIL12 (attIL12)-T cell therapy (PCT/US2017/055645; UTSC.P1424US.P1). Arming T
cells (CAR-T, autologous T, or TILs) with this attIL12 has potential to reduce the risk of CRS because this
attIL12-T cells seems no longer induce CRS cytokine expression and avoids T cells stall in lungs but rather
accumulates in tumors. The safety, efficacy, and the immune mechanism of this attIL12-armed T cell therapy
will be investigated in this application.
This application is novel and impactful because a novel and safe T cell therapy will be investigated."

10848320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - CLINICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH CORE
The Clinical Science Research Core (CSRC) enhances and facilitates leading-edge clinical and translational
nutrition/obesity research through the operation of two distinct but interactive sub-cores that provide an array of
services and unique training through a cohesive, “one-stop” organizational structure that ensures optimal
integration of high-quality services and training.
The Clinical Studies Performance sub-core assists investigators by: i) providing consultation in designing a
clinical research study and in interpreting the results of the data generated by core analyses, ii) providing
biostatistical support to determine adequate sample size and appropriate statistical analysis, iii) measuring
body composition and energy expenditure, iv) developing and preparing study protocol-specific meals for
metabolic testing and take-out meals for diet intervention studies, v) preparing stable isotopically labeled
metabolic tracer and hormone infusates to assess metabolic function, vi) providing high-quality, clinical
laboratory tests used to determine participant eligibility, monitor participants during interventions, and evaluate
metabolic functions, vii) obtaining muscle and adipose tissue biopsy samples and inserting radial artery
catheters for blood sampling, viii) evaluating cardiovascular function, ix) performing exercise and physical
performance testing, x) providing inpatient and outpatient sleep monitoring services, xi) providing assistance in
implementing lifestyle interventions (diet manipulation, weight loss/weight gain, exercise training); and xii)
providing training in specific procedures to aid investigators in the performance of clinical studies.
The Metabolic Kinetics sub-core assists investigators by: i) providing consultation in designing protocols to
evaluate metabolic kinetics (e.g., the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure and frequently sampled
intravenous glucose tolerance test in conjunction with stable isotopically-labeled tracer infusions to evaluate
whole-body and tissue- -cell function) and in interpreting the results of the data
generated by core analyses, ii) mass-spectrometry analysis of biospecimens to determine tracer enrichment in
metabolic substrates and macromolecules, iii) mathematical modeling of tracer and non-tracer data to assess
metabolic kinetics, and iv) providing education and training in specific analyses. The Metabolic Kinetics sub-
core has a long tradition of providing these services and in the past has focused its sample analysis and
modeling on specific metabolites to evaluate specific metabolic pathways (e.g., adipose tissue triglyceride
lipolytic rate, hepatic glucose production rate, VLDL-triglyceride and apolipoprotein B-100 production rate). The
core has now expanded these services to include the new and rapidly evolving discipline of dynamic
metabolomics, which makes it possible to evaluate metabolite flux through entire metabolic networks."
10848326,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY CORE
The Cellular and Molecular Biology Core (CMBC), previously known as the Adipocyte Biology and Molecular
Nutrition Core, was established in 2006 to primarily assist NORC members in the assessment of adipose
tissue morphology and function. Since then, the Core has broadened its scope to meet the changing needs of
the NORC Research Base and advance in scientific focus. The new name of the Core is more inclusive and
reflects these changes. The purpose of the CMBC is to assist NORC investigators in conducting leading-edge
research in the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis and complications of
obesity and the abnormalities associated with disruptive alterations in nutrient intake/metabolism.
Accordingly, services provided by the CMBC are no longer focused only on adipose tissue biology, but also
provide critical infrastructure and technical support to study muscle, liver, and endothelial cell function.
Research supported by the CMBC now also includes crosstalk between different tissues (e.g., adipose to liver
or muscle) and between different cells within a tissue (e.g., stromal vascular cells and adipocytes). The CMBC
enhances and facilitates sophisticated nutrition/obesity research by providing: 1) cellular assessments and
services needed for mechanistic studies, including: i) cell lines (mouse and human pre-adipocytes, adipocytes,
myoblasts, macrophages) with optimized culture and differentiation protocols; ii) adipose tissue morphology
assessments; iii) isolation of preadipocytes and immune cells from stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue
explants/biopsies; iv) standardized preparation of tissue samples for gene expression and protein content; v)
optimized protocols for metabolic studies in cells and tissue explants/biopsies (e.g. glucose and fatty acid
uptake and release); vi) cell/tissue respiration and mitochondrial function; vii) plasma adipokine, myokine,
hepatokine and cytokine concentration using multiplex technology, and viii) isolation and characterization of
extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles); 2) access to specialized equipment; and 3) expert
consultative services in integrative cellular and molecular biology to allow investigators at any level of
experience to conduct mechanistic nutrition/obesity research. Many CMBC services are not available within
other cores and are completely unique at Washington University, providing critical and cost-effective research
support for NORC investigators. In addition, the CMBC interacts closely with both the NORC Clinical Sciences
Research Core (CSRC) and the Animal Model Research Core (AMRC), so that assays performed by the
CMBC on blood and tissue samples collected from research participants and animals are performed in
conjunction with the analyses conducted in the CSRC and AMRC to provide a comprehensive and integrated
assessment of study outcomes."
10848329,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - ANIMAL MODEL RESEARCH CORE
The goal of the Animal Model Research (AMR) Core of the NORC is to facilitate the nutrition and obesity-
related research of investigators using animal models to generate transformational insights into human
disease. Since 1999, the Core has provided sophisticated approaches for characterizing animal models for
nutrition and obesity research to support investigators. The AMR Core has responded to the evolving needs of
NORC investigators by introducing new services, adopting novel technologies, and refinining training programs
to ensure high quality animal phenotyping relevant to issues in nutritional metabolism and obesity in people.
There are several areas of highly utilized services supported by the Core: 1) Consultation and training in the
use of animal models and technical procedures; 2) Biochemical analyses of lipids and glucose in serum and
tissues; 3) Body composition analyses; and 4) Metabolic assessment of energy metabolism and balance. We
are now offering new services based on feedback from NORC investigators and the availabiltiy of new and
advanced instrumentation at Washington University School of Medicine to quantify metabolism in vivo. These
new services include: 1) Treadmill exercise services, 2) Substrate uptake and metabolism, and 3) Exosome
biodistribution. Over this past funding period, the Core has expanded its commitment to training related to
animal care and analytic techniques with a goal of ensuring rigor and reproducibility of the science supported
by the NORC, added new instrumention in addition to upgrading existing equipment, and modified operations
to provide expanded access to Core resources. These procedural changes, in concert with our long term
(since 2003) cooperative agreement with the Diabetes Models Phenotyping Core of the Diabetes Research
Center (DRC) at Washington University, have led to cost savings, shared institutional investments, and more
facile collaborations that have enhanced the scientific productivity of NORC investigators."
10848332,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE CORE
The primary goal of the new Dissemination and Implementation Science Core (DISC) is to provide NORC
investigators with support integrating dissemination and implementation (D&I) science into their nutrition and
obesity-related research programs. The D&I of biomedical discoveries is challenging but an absolute necessity
to ensure all populations benefit from investments in nutrition and obesity research, and close the gap between
biomedical discovery and evidence-based practices, interventions, and policies. The DISC will help NORC
investigators develop the knowledge and skills needed to apply state-of-the-art D&I science to their research
programs through the following two specific aims. Aim 1 will provide individual consultation and training in D&I
scientific methods for nutrition and obesity research through which we will: a) conceptualize and design
implementation science studies, b) develop a dissemination plan for studies, c) ensure efficient use of D&I
web-based toolkits and other resources, and d) conduct manuscript and grant application reviews. Aim 2 will
build team capacity in the broad range of skills essential for D&I research. To accomplish this aim we will: a)
engage NORC investigators in the Washington University Network for Dissemination and Implementation
Research (WUNDIR), a regular (every 6 weeks) event that addresses methodological and conceptual
challenges of research grants and publications that involve D&I science and fosters transdisciplinary team
science; and b) coordinate biannual day-long Next Steps events, in which NORC investigators form
collaborative teams to develop manuscripts and/or grant proposals that incorporate D&I science into nutrition
and obesity research. The application of D&I science to T1 and T2 research provided by the DISC is cutting
edge in support of the earliest phases of translational research, which will accelerate the translation of
knowledge from NORC discoveries to real-world settings, and improve the potential for equitable impact on
population health."
10863965,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a very high risk of fracture: about 2 to 3-fold increased risk of all
fractures and 4-fold increased risk of hip fracture that may be due in large part to their very high risk of multiple
falls. Compared with other patients who suffer fractures, PD patients have more severe consequences of
fractures: they have twice the risk of dying following hip and pelvic fractures and longer and incomplete
functional recovery, with worsening of Parkinson's disease. Crucially, men and women age 65 or older have a
fracture risk that is so high, that even those with normal bone density (BMD) for age would warrant a therapy
that has been proven to reduce fracture risk in patients with PD.
 However, very few PD patients age 65 of older receive a treatment for osteoporosis. There are several major
barriers to treatment of PD patients with drugs for osteoporosis. 1) There is a lack of evidence that treatments
reduce fracture risk in patients with PD whose risk of fractures may be due to multiple and more severe falls. 2)
Standard osteoporosis screening and treatment may also be a barrier. Medical visits to assess fracture risk,
test BMD, prescribe treatment, generally an oral drug, and then follow-up to monitor compliance and response
to treatment, are particularly burdensome for patients with PD. 3) Most patients with PD do not continue taking
oral osteoporosis drugs even for 1 year.
 We propose a randomized trial that addresses all of these barriers. 1) We will test the anti-fracture efficacy of
Zoledronic acid (ZA) a very potent bisphosphonate that inhibits bone loss and decreased fracture risk in
women with osteoporosis and patients with hip fractures. 2) We will give ZA intravenously at home without
clinic visits. 3) ZA inhibits bone loss for at least 2 years overcoming noncompliance with oral drugs. We will
enroll 3,500 men and women PD age 65 years or older from large health systems, patient communities, and
referrals from neurologists in the Parkinson's Study Group. A movement disorders specialist will confirm the
diagnosis of PD by telemedicine. We will then provide calcium and vitamin D supplements. A research nurse
will visit the patient at home, check for potential contraindications to ZA and then administer IV ZA or placebo.
We will then follow patients for 2 years to ascertain and confirm fractures.
 A successful result may revolutionize the care of patients with PD. It may lead to guidelines promoting
home-based ZA treatment of older PD patients. ZA, rather than oral drugs, would become the 1st line treatment
for patients with PD. The trial would demonstrate that home-based treatment with ZA, without other
assessments, could reach all older PD patients without the need for burdensome medical visits. Thus, a
positive result may lead to treatment of many more PD patients and a substantial reduction in the occurrence
of disabling fractures in patients with PD."
10843284,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in improving
fatigue and other outcomes such as sexual function, quality of life, body composition, muscle strength and
physical activity in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in young cancer survivors who report
fatigue and have testosterone deficiency. Fatigue is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms in
men with cancer affecting 70-100% of patients irrespective of their age. Cancer-related fatigue is experienced
by patients not only during active cancer treatment, but is also highly prevalent in cancer survivors who exhibit
persistent fatigue months to years after the end of their treatment with the highest prevalence being in
recipients of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In addition to fatigue, sexual dysfunction is also
highly prevalent in male cancer survivors. Male cancer survivors also have increased fat mass and
decreased lean body mass, a phenotype that predisposes them to reduced muscle strength. This phenotype
of fatigue, sexual dysfunction and adverse body composition is commonly encountered in non-cancer patient
populations with testosterone deficiency, a condition which is also highly prevalent (50-90%) in cancer
survivors. Pivotal trials of testosterone replacement therapy in non-cancer patient populations have shown an
improvement in fatigue, sexual function and body composition in men randomized to testosterone compared
with placebo. However, the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on cancer-related fatigue has not
been studied. We propose a large, 9-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which: 1) we
will compare the efficacy of weekly testosterone injections versus placebo in improving fatigue scores in cancer
survivors who report fatigue and also have testosterone deficiency, 2) we will compare the effects of
testosterone replacement versus placebo on sexual function, well-being, mood and quality of life, and 3) we
will determine the effect of testosterone administration on body composition, muscle strength and physical
activity compared with placebo. With an increase in longevity among cancer survivors and the growing
recognition of the importance of symptom control in the lives of these patients, the proposed trial is likely to
have a significant clinical impact in the management of patient-reported outcomes. If testosterone therapy is
found to be efficacious in alleviating these symptoms, the clinicians will have available to them a therapeutic
option that is relatively inexpensive, convenient to use and has a good safety record in young men."
10813759,"Aging in humans is associated with a host of brain diseases, including tumors of glial progenitor cells
and degeneration of neuronal cells. However, the mechanisms by which age and disease risk interact are
poorly understood. Recent studies from our group have shown that somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNV)
accumulate even in nondividing neurons in the human cortex, resulting in thousands of sSNV per neuronal
genome by old age. Further, the patterns of sSNV that are found can be classified, and normal brains appear
to have somatic variants that were present at birth, variants that accumulate over time, and variants caused by
oxidative damage. Our studies also find a significantly higher rate of sSNV accumulation in neurons from
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain, likely related to increased oxidative damage. These studies relied on new
techniques that allow deep whole genome sequencing of DNA isolated from a single neuron taken from frozen
postmortem brain.
 This new study aims to further characterize the rates and patters of somatic variants that accumulate in
single neurons and glia as an individual ages, and determine how this accumulation of mutations is related to
AD as well as the formation of glial tumors. The first aim will examine neurons form different regions of normal
brain at different ages. This will give us a better understanding of how these mutations accumulate with age,
and the specific mutational forces at work in different brain areas. The second aim will perform a similar
analysis, this time focused on glial cells instead of neurons. In the final aim, we will look at neurons in the
brains of individuals who had AD, and analyze how the rate and patter of mutations differ compared to aged-
matched normal brain. This will provide valuable insight into the causes of somatic mutations in AD.
 There is compelling evidence to suggest that somatic mutations in individual neurons are an important
factor in at least some neurodegenerative disorders, and our data implicate them in normal cognitive aging.
For the first time, the tools exist to examine these questions, and this study is designed to determine how
somatic SNV impact normal aging, brain tumor formation, and AD. This is a crucial step in understanding the
molecular cause of AD, and a prerequisite to the development of treatments and cures."

center providing strategic resources to support innovative, high impact population dynamics research. PRI’s
overarching aim is to advance the scientific understanding of human population dynamics and processes, with
a focus on PRI’s primary research areas. First, through research on communities, neighborhoods and spatial
processes, PRI is contributing to our understanding of human population distribution across neighborhoods
and communities, the social processes that bring about these spatial patterns, and their consequences for the
health and wellbeing of individuals, families and children. Second, PRI scholarship increases knowledge of the
causes and consequences of migration and immigrant integration for health and health disparities across the
life course and generations. Third, PRI researchers address how families and social networks critically mediate
broader social change and social institutions and contribute to observed disparities between advantaged and
marginalized groups. Research assesses the structural and social barriers that prevent families from
supporting children’s health and well-being. Fourth, PRI supports research in population health with a focus on
the social determinants of maternal, child and adolescent morbidity and the important interactions between
biological factors and external environments on later development and health. PRI has historical strengths in
these areas and benefits from its institutional environment at the Pennsylvania State University that
encourages interdisciplinary population research excellence through generous financial and infrastructure
support. Through innovation and investment, PRI plans for integration and cross-collaboration across its
primary research areas in the next five years. PRI will accomplish this through its additional specific aims. First,
PRI aims to develop new leaders in population science, particularly the emerging leaders among junior
scholars. With a successful track record as an incubator of population research, PRI’s Development core will
provide additional mentoring and support for junior scholars and new opportunities designed to build
competitiveness for peer-reviewed external funding and increased impact of population science. Second, PRI
aims to foster novel approaches and methods that will make important and cutting-edge contributions to
population research through its Computational and Spatial Analysis core. Third, PRI’s Administrative core aims
to increase research productivity and collaboration, reducing the barriers and burdens associated with
research administration, and increasing the reach of population science."
10873010,"Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common cause of stroke and results in the highest rates
of stroke-related morbidity and mortality. While ICH can be spontaneous, it is also a well-known feature of
severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Each year 1.7 million Americans sustain a TBI and nearly half of these will
result in long-term disability. In addition, TBI has become the signature wound of recent military operations
and training with 17.3% of veterans meeting criteria for TBI during military service in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Despite intensive research efforts and advances in critical care, the 30-day mortality rate from ICH has not
changed significantly in the last 30 years. Current management remains largely restricted to optimizing
cerebral perfusion pressure and providing supportive care. While the use of recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa)
as a hemostatic agent significantly reduces hematoma growth for patients with hemorrhagic stroke and TBI,
the mortality benefit remains unclear. This is, in part, due to the significant risk of complications from diffuse
inflammation and microvascular dysfunction that can exacerbate hemorrhage and cause secondary neuronal
injury via mechanisms that are not amenable to surgical or hemostatic intervention. In addition, the use of
rFVIIa is limited by a significant risk of thrombotic complications, particularly at higher doses. Therefore, a
molecule with both hemostatic and anti-inflammatory activities could have distinct advantages over existing
therapies by reducing both the primary and secondary complications of bleeding.
 The efficacy of rFVIIa is dependent on binding to activated platelets; however, previous attempts to improve
this drug have failed, in part, because the mechanism of platelet-rFVIIa binding is not well understood.
Therefore, the overall objective of the proposed studies is to elucidate the mechanisms of platelet-rFVIIa
interaction as a means to design rFVIIa variants with enhanced hemostatic efficacy, reduced thrombotic risk,
and potential anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties.
 Studies in the current proposal will focus on how procoagulant platelets store and regulate the surface
expression of a novel protein that contributes to the binding and hemostatic activity of rFVIIa. These studies
will use a combination of confocal microscopy and immunogold staining followed by transmission electron
microscopy to characterize the subcellular localization of this protein and further define its origin, trafficking,
and the potential regulation of its platelet-surface expression. This data will be enhanced by further studies
that will utilize a chemical cross-linking and proteomics approach to identify additional partner(s) that make up
the complex simultaneous interactions required for platelet-rFVIIa binding. Finally, this work will also
determine the therapeutic potential of a novel Protein C-FVIIa chimera designed with the potential for
increased hemostatic efficacy and reduced thrombotic risk relative to rFVIIa while retaining the anti-
inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of Protein C. Flow cytometric analyses and enzyme activity assays
will determine the platelet binding and activity of this chimera in vitro. Hemostatic efficacy and thrombogenic
potential will be determined in vivo using murine saphenous vein bleeding and venous stasis models,
respectively. The potential cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects will also be determined using cell
culture and murine vascular permeability assays.
 When completed, this work will have a positive translational impact by elucidating the interactions necessary
for platelet-rFVIIa binding and providing insights into how platelets regulate the surface expression of
procoagulant proteins. In addition, the PC-FVIIa chimera not only represents a hemostatic agent that could be
developed for clinical use, it also serves as a tool to address basic mechanisms of hemostasis and guide the
design of other potential therapies to address the significant unmet need for better strategies to improve
outcomes in veterans with ICH due to stroke or severe TBI."

10877172,"The mission of the Tufts MD-PhD program is to foster the development of diverse and talented trainees into
successful, resilient, and innovative physician-scientist leaders who will drive solutions to existing, emergent,
and future critical health care challenges. Using the best evidence-based teaching practices, our objectives are
to promote knowledge and skills for conducting and leading rigorous and reproducible research, the
achievement of excellence in clinical medicine, and the development of competencies that promote the
resilience needed to identify, adapt, and sustain efforts to meet evolving unmet healthcare needs in our
society. The rationale for this approach is that ~24% of MSTP trainees nationwide pursue private practice, and
that women and underrepresented minorities tend to spend longer in training and obtain less grant funding,
highlighting the need for training approaches that optimize training outcomes and continued participation in
research. To enhance trainee success and propel them to leadership in academic medicine, we provide
trainees with new and evolving tools for recognizing and coping with the complex stressors of modern
academic medicine. These include novel curricula in: Wellness and Resilience and Physician Leadership;
enhanced, evidence-based mentor training; new computational biology courses; and a clinical and translational
training option for those who wish to focus on patient-oriented research. We continue to provide a highly
integrated approach to training with flexibility built in to accommodate dual degree students. We offer a clinical
clerkship prior to entry into graduate training, and an abbreviated Family Medicine clerkship during graduate
school which allows students to stay firmly connected to clinical medicine providing flexibility in re-entry to
medical training when the PhD is complete. Medical training interfaces with 5 biomedical graduate programs in
Cell, Molecular, & Developmental Biology, Genetics, Immunology, Molecular Microbiology, Neuroscience, and
a new graduate program in Clinical and Translational Science. Our integrated curriculum also includes a
Clinical Implications of Basic Research course, an annual retreat, a career-oriented dinner program, and other
skill-building workshops such as Resilience and Physician Leadership. These include preparation for the
transition from graduate school to clinical medical training, mentoring for NIH applications, a women physician-
scientist group, and a workshop focused on choosing research-focused residencies. Finally, to enhance the
diversity of thought in biomedicine, the Tufts MSTP will leverage new initiatives at TUSM and GSBS that
enhance Diversity, Equity, Inclusiveness and Belonging, increase our number of URG trainees, and promote
an inclusive and welcoming community. With a strong institutional commitment to the MSTP, we have
expanded our enrollment through a Second Portal program for trainees already enrolled in medical school and
have a target size of five entering trainees each year. Our MSTP has graduated 109 trainees, and 38 are
currently enrolled. We request funding for 10 positions in this application."
10829407,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this Maximizing Investigator’s Research Award renewal application is to advance
understanding of how inductive and morphogenetic processes during vertebrate embryogenesis are coordinated
to ensure normal development. Early inductive processes controlled by maternal and zygotic gene products
establish embryonic polarity and germ layers, while convergence and extension (C&E) gastrulation movements
elongate embryonic tissues down the anteroposterior axis and narrow them mediolaterally. The noncanonical
Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (Wnt/PCP) signaling pathway polarizes morphologies and behaviors of mesenchymal
gastrula cells that shape embryonic body. We previously proposed that Wnt/PCP signaling acts as a cellular
compass that orients cells with respect to the anteroposterior embryonic axis, but how the compass is regulated
is not understood. During the previous funding period, we surprisingly found that several pathways work in
parallel to Wnt/PCP to polarize cells during C&E. We also implicated in C&E another conserved regulator of
planar polarity, Dachsous atypical cadherin, which is essential for many processes, including embryonic
cleavages and axis specification, by promoting microtubule dynamics. We invested significant effort in generating
new genetic tools to probe the mechanisms of the Wnt/PCP compass and initiated a genetic screen for new
gastrulation regulators.
 These findings and tools motivate our future studies in three research themes. In the first, we will investigate
how numerous membrane receptors, including Gpr125 adhesion GPCR, which we implicated in the Wnt/PCP
compass, interact during C&E. Using precise mutations and tags in the endogenous gpr125 locus, proteomic
and genetic experiments, we will test whether Gpr125 promotes formation of Wnt/PCP complexes composed of
select components. In the second theme, we will extend our studies of Dachsous and investigate whether it
regulates gastrulation movements by promoting microtubule dynamics. Using Dachsous endogenously tagged
with GFP, we will carry out proteomic studies to isolate endogenous interactors, and genome editing to define
its critical regions. In a parallel unbiased genetic approach, we will continue a promising genetic screen for
maternal and maternal-zygotic mutations that impair embryogenesis and gastrulation. Altogether, our
mechanistic studies of Wnt/PCP and Dachsous regulators of planar cell polarity and unbiased genetic screens,
will both advance the MIRA mission and understanding how inductive and morphogenetic processes are
coordinated during vertebrate gastrulation. As mutations in the components of these pathways cause
miscarriages, birth defects and diseases, our studies will provide insights into their understanding and diagnosis,
and facilitate development of therapies."
10808096,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 How cells dynamically control their proteome in response to stress is a fundamental aspect of
understanding how organisms are able to react to changing environments. Two representative features of the
cellular stress response, which is universally conserved across eukarya and occurs in response to a variety of
different noxious environmental conditions, are 1) the upregulation of the cytoprotective heat shock proteins
and 2) biomolecular condensation of RNA and protein into assemblies. Most translation is shut down, while
proteins involved in the stress response are efficiently produced. How translation is reprogrammed to favor
heat shock protein production post-transcriptionally is poorly understood, but biomolecular condensation has
been linked to translational control. Basic questions are incompletely answered: 1) Which mRNAs condense in
response to stress? 2) What cellular mechanisms are responsible for mRNA condensation? And 3) What is the
functional relevance of mRNA condensation to translational control?
 Herein, we present unpublished work measuring mRNA solubility of >5,000 genes during temperature
stress in S. cerevisiae by biochemical sedimentation followed by RNA-Sequencing. These data inform our
hypothesis that blocking translation initiation triggers condensation of an mRNA through specific binding by
unknown protein factor(s). We also predict that mRNA condensation during stress is an adaptive process
contributing to the preferential translation of stress response messages. To test these hypotheses, we aim to
confirm that blocking translation initiation triggers mRNA condensation both on a transcriptome-wide and
individual message level, to determine protein factors required for mRNA condensation, and to test the role of
mRNA condensation in translational reprogramming during stress. Preliminary data measuring the solubility of
both native and reporter mRNAs support that blocking translation initiation triggers condensation. We have
identified and will interrogate a set of the translation initiation factors as candidates putatively required for
mRNA condensation. We will test whether the candidates are required for mRNA condensation and measure
the translational effect of perturbing mRNA condensation during stress.
 Biomolecular condensates are intimately related to cellular RNA homeostasis, and their dysfunction has
been linked to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
Knowledge of how mRNAs condense and the functional role of condensation informs disease pathogenesis
and may inform future treatments for those affected."
10817008,"Project Summary: Percutaneous devices are often utilized in medicine and serve as a bridge between the
internal and external bodily environments. Dental implants, bone-anchored hearing aids, and percutaneous
osseointegrated (OI) devices for amputees are just a few examples. Although widely used, the soft tissue
interface (in particularly, the epidermis) with these devices commonly fails to heal properly and disintegrates
over time. It is known that immediately following percutaneous implantation; epidermal cells migrate proximally
along the implant surface in an attempt to heal the surgically-created soft tissue defect. This phenomenon,
termed ""epidermal downgrowth,"" creates a sinus tract around the implant and provides a nidus for bacterial
colonization. To improve patient outcomes, our previously funded PRORP study investigated the relationship
between crystallinity and coating stability of fluoridated apatites. The data revealed that sintered fluorapatite
(FA) possessed the ability to enhance epidermal adhesion and differentiation—a transition highly crucial for
preserving the integrity of soft tissue attachment at the implant exit-site—when compared to the current
standards of practice, titanium. These data further revealed that osteoblasts and fibroblasts also have affinities
to this treated apatite surface, implicating a possible wider application of these apatites for promoting
osseointegration as well as skin integration. FA coatings are not currently used in percutaneous
osseointegrated (OI) device applications, and thus considered novel. It was believed that commercial
technologies that use high temperatures for vaporizing the coating materials might not be suitable for
maintaining the optimized crystallinity found within the sintered FA agglomerates. Thus, we used a low-
temperature proprietary coating technique, IonTite™, which worked well in initial animal trials in rats and pigs.
The overall goal of this proposal is to undertake safe and efficacious testing of this coating in a weight-bearing
large animal model prior to assessing its clinical and commercialization potentials. To this end, we
hypothesized that epidermally mediated downgrowth, osseointegration and healing outcomes around
the percutaneous OI devices would be improved by coating the devices with a bioactive, fluorapatite
sintered at 1150°C. Aim 1 will establish an ideal, low temperature, commercial coating technique for applying
FA to titanium surfaces. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of the FA-coated percutaneous OI devices to prevent
epidermal downgrowth and to accelerate osseointegration in a weight-bearing large animal model. Aim 3 will
confirm the completion of wound healing cascades within the periprosthetic tissue of FA-coated devices by
molecular means. The outcome of this proposed study will have immediate clinical applications for the design
of both permanent and temporary percutaneous implants. This proposed technology will permit current
amputee patient populations, who are suffering from life-long complications associated with the stump-socket
interface, to be fitted with the FA-coated percutaneous OI prostheses."

 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease characterized by selective destruction
of the insulin secreting b-cells found in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. While T-lymphocytes are the primary
mediators of b-cell destruction during disease development, the pathways that initiate this autoimmune attack
are unknown. There is a genetic predisposition for diabetes development, but the low concordance rate among
identical twins (less than 40%) suggest that environmental factors participate in the induction of autoimmune
diabetes. While virus infection is one environmental factor that has been proposed to initiate b-cell damage
during the development of diabetes, the effects of infection on b-cell function and viability as well as the activation
of b-cell defense responses to infection are poorly understood. The broad goals of this research program are to
define the biochemical mechanisms by which environmental factors, specifically virus infection, contribute to
disease development. Much of the focus of this competitive renewal application is on the mechanisms by which
b-cells participate in disease tolerance to virus infection. Disease tolerance is an evolutionary conserved defense
strategy that limits the impact of a pathogen on host fitness without directly modifying the pathogen. Using a
mouse tropic enterovirus that is known to infect and replicate in b-cells and that induces diabetes in susceptible
strains of mice (Encephalomyocarditis virus, EMCV), we have identified a novel pathway by which b-cell resist
EMCV infection. This protective pathway is mediated by nitric oxide, the same free radical produced by b-cell
following cytokine stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression. We show that nitric oxide, in b-
cell selective manner, enhances b-cell fitness by limiting virus replication and we hypothesize that it is when this
disease tolerance is broken that diabetes ensues."

Treatment advances in psychosis may be limited by the use of phenomenology-defined diagnoses based on
symptomatic outcomes, rather than by neurobiological constructs monitored by quantitative characteristics. The
Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) uses biomarkers to define psychosis
subgroups with the goal of testing the advantages of B-SNIP biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions,
consistent with principles in the NIMH Strategic Plan (NSP). With >3000 phenotyped psychosis probands,
relatives and healthy controls, B-SNIP has a multilevel biomarker library for psychosis and used that library to
re-conceptualize psychosis subgroups as biomarker-defined Biotypes (B1, B2, B3), where B1 and B2 are the
low cognition/high symptom groups and B3 shows lower symptoms and relatively normal cognition. We
replicated Biotypes in a new sample, “forging a future where measures of an individual’s … neural and
physiological state will form the basis of an increasingly specific and informative diagnosis” (NSP). In this grant
we propose that B1, with its low cognition and low cortical activity, will respond uniquely to clozapine, a drug
which will generate active cortical attractor networks in B1 to support symptomatic improvement.
Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic drug (APD) with unique clinical efficacy. It is the least used APD
because its side effects are serious (neutropenia, myocarditis, seizures) and its administration complex. A
predictive biomarker would allow targeting of cases most likely to respond and improve prognosis in psychosis.
B-SNIP has shown that clozapine is associated with increases in EEG measures of alpha/theta power, and we
identify this increase in time periods without stimulus processing requirements as intrinsic EEG activity (IEA),
across all Biotypes. Because B1 cases express low IEA, clozapine’s action to increase EEG power will be
normalizing for this psychosis subgroup, with increased cortical attractor states. Because B2 express
accentuated IEA, clozapine is associated with more deviant IEA in B2. We propose to test B1 psychosis cases
with clozapine vs. risperidone (n=40/group clinical trial completers), over a 6 week cross-titration (to therapeutic
plasma levels) and a 9 week stable dose extension, predicting that the B1/clozapine group will respond
significantly better, as measured with total PANSS, than the B1/risperidone group and also better than either B2
group. It is our hypothesis that the cortical attractor networks will be normalized and their function increased by
the increase in intrinsic EEG activity."

The Scientific Core is designed to successfully recruit and monitor HCV-antibody-negative people who inject
drugs (PWID) for HCV infection and to identify and characterize acute infections and reinfections by testing
sera for HCV RNA and seroconversion with serial ALT and HCV RNA testing. The infrastructure of Core B was
necessary for completion of the first trial of an HCV vaccine in people at risk of HCV infection and will be useful
in potential future trials of HCV vaccines. Plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be
collected from prior to infection, during infection, and through the time when infection outcome (clearance or
persistence of virus as well as during reinfection. Samples are stored in the repository for use in Projects 1-4,
as well as for other HCV investigators. Core B will also provide standardized serological testing to quantitate
HCV envelope-specific antibodies in plasma or serum of humans or vaccinated animals. Quantitative analyses
of vaccine-induced plasma or serum antibody responses are essential to identify the most promising vaccine
candidates. By applying a standardized set of assays to samples post-vaccination and from humans who
successfully cleared multiple HCV infections, we will be able to make quantitative and qualitative comparisons
between vaccine-induced antibody responses in mice or nonhuman primates (Projects 3 and 5) and human
responses that are protective against HCV in vivo (Project 2). This will facilitate identification the vaccines most
likely to be protective when advanced to human trials."
10845282,"Project Summary/Abstract
High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is both the most common and most lethal ovarian cancer
histotype. Though HGSOC has been long thought to originate in the ovary, recent evidence now suggests that
HGSOC precursor lesions in fact originate in the fallopian tube. Further, select dysplastic cells from the
fallopian tube disseminate from these precursor lesions and follow a variety of local migratory cues in order to
colonize the ovary and establish a primary HGSOC tumor. The ovary seems to facilitate the expansion and
spread of the ovary to the rest of the peritoneal space. Though this phenomenon is well documented, the
molecular mechanisms that drive the initial dissemination of dysplastic fallopian tube cells to the ovary are
poorly understood. To address this, our group has developed a new imaging mass spectrometry technique that
has allowed for unprecedented insight into the paracrine factors that create a pro-metastatic niche and allow
for the migration of fallopian tube cells toward the ovary. Using this technique, we determined that co-culture of
murine ovary explants with dysplastic tubal cells leads to consistent increases in norepinephrine secretion from
the ovary, later found to be produced by the ovary itself. This is significant, as norepinephrine is an established
tumor promoter in advanced disease, and ovarian cancer patients taking β-blockers that interfere with
norepinephrine signals typically have improved clinical outcomes. However, the role of norepinephrine in tumor
development is largely unknown. Given the wide availability, low cost, and minimal adverse effects of β-
blockers, should norepinephrine similarly enhance the development of HGSOC this may provide opportunity
for early intervention and/or chemoprevention in high-risk patients. Given the potential to directly impact clinical
practice, it is essential to further dissect both the mechanisms that direct norepinephrine biosynthesis, as well
as the downstream effects of norepinephrine during HGSOC development. Through the experiments detailed
in this proposal, we will gain valuable insight into these events in hopes of either preventing or delaying
HGSOC development in high-risk patients."

Computational multi-scale modeling is a growing area of research that aims to link whole slide images and
radiographic iamges with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Multi-scale modeling has shown
its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable
molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. Current
applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term
outcomes. No actionable information can be gained from multi-scale biomarkers yet.
We propose to develop a multi-scale modeling framework to support treatment response, treatment monitoring
and treatment allocation for patients with brain tumors, focusing on the most aggressive subtype of glioma, IDH
wild-type high grade glioma. In Aim 1, we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate multi-scale data for
treatment response. We will use our expertise in data fusion and develop novel approaches to integrate multi-
scale data to predict first line treatment response. In Aim 2, we will develop algorithms that allow combining
multi-scale data at diagnosis with multi-modal MR imaging data during treatment follow-up. We will focus on
predicting treatment response and progression and whether we can predict these events earlier than
radiologists can. In Aim 3, we will develop algorithms that use the multi-scale data to predict drug target
activities and also suggest novel drugs for patients that become resistant to first line treatment. We will use a
mixture of publicly available glioma multi-scale data sets totaling more than 1000 patients, and also 1600
retrospective and 150 prospective brain tumor patients from Stanford Medical Center.
Combining these complementary data sources in a multi-scale framework for data fusion can have profound
contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More
specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to
develop multi-scale signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to brain tumor patients by investigating
biomarkers that accurately predict treatment response. Readily, because whole slide images and radiographic
imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of brain tumors is
increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable multi-scale signatures can be found reflecting
treatment response, translation to clinical applications is feasible, including optimizing recruitment for clinical
trials."
10890588,"Discovering the functions of the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome is a required step for
understanding human biology and disease. Genetic model organisms, including zebrafish, play a critical role in
this discovery process, because genetic analysis can connect gene sequence and function. Model organism
databases, like ZFIN, provide tools required to make this connection.
 The zebrafish has emerged as a premier organism to study vertebrate biology. Powerful techniques allow
rapid efficient generation and recovery of mutations affecting genes that orchestrate developmental patterning,
organogenesis, physiology, and behavior. It is easy to study gene function by generating transgenic zebrafish,
by knocking down gene function with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, or by altering gene function by
genome editing. The genome has been sequenced and about 50% of the protein coding genes have been
mutated by targeted gene knockout technology. Large-scale projects are underway or planned that will
produce functional data about almost all the genes and sequence-based functional elements in the genome.
Multiple mutations and gene knockdowns can be combined in the same individual to study gene modifiers and
other genetic interactions. The functions of most of these genes are conserved among vertebrate groups.
Thus, analysis of zebrafish mutations provides insights into gene functions in other vertebrates, including
humans.
 The long term goals for ZFIN are a) to be the community database resource for the laboratory use of
zebrafish, b) to develop and support integrated zebrafish genetic, genomic, developmental, and physiological
information, c) to maintain the definitive reference data sets of zebrafish research information, d) to link this
information extensively to corresponding data in other model organism and human databases, e) to facilitate
the use of zebrafish as a model for human biology, and f) to help serve the broad needs of the biomedical
research community.
 This project will continue and expand curation of zebrafish research data, develop expanded support for
zebrafish models of human disease, expand and integrate links to other databases, and maintain and update
the zebrafish reference genome. This work will provide a powerful means for researchers to associate gene
sequence and function, thus facilitating studies of human gene function and disease as well as cross-species
analyses of genome organization and evolution."

 The Molecular Metabolism Training Program (MMTP) at the Harvard Chan School of
Public Health (HSPH) will train a new generation of academic scientists committed to
conducting cutting-edge research in metabolism and metabolic disease. Central features of this
program include integration of innovative platforms in ‘omics, microbiome analysis, animal
physiology, imaging, and other technologies for analyzing metabolism; unique coursework in
metabolism and metabolic disease, biostatistics, epidemiology, and computational analysis with
a public health focus; and a collaborative faculty based at HSPH and adjacent institutions in the
Longwood Medical Area.
 MMTP leverages the innovative training environment offered at a top public health
institution, supplementing it with rigorous training in emerging molecular analysis tools. Trainees
will study both individual and population aspects of disease and other unique resources offered
at a school of public health. The vibrant community of twenty-one faculty mentors studies
multidisciplinary questions such as the interactions between the immune system and exercise or
over-nutrition; the effect of the microbiome on metabolism; the role of lipid drop or mitochondrial
dynamics in metabolic homeostasis; or the effects of metabolic flux on energy metabolism in
well and disease states. Research focuses on understanding the most significant challenges to
global public health, including metabolic syndrome and the related lipotoxic diseases of type 2
diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic diseases of an aging population,
immunometabolism, and immune and microbiome contributions to digestive health.
 We are requesting funding for three new predoctoral students and one postdoctoral
fellow every year, so the T32 would support twenty trainees over its five years. Pre-doctoral
students will obtain a PhD in Biological Sciences in Public Health (BPH) from one of the most
highly ranked public health doctoral programs in the nation. BPH attracts a diverse student body
and has a successful track record in supporting these students. Postdoctoral fellows will have
access to coursework, mentors, and a highly interactive metabolism research community.
MMTP will thus train a diverse group of interdisciplinary scientists who can apply innovative
research methods to understand fundamental questions in human metabolism."
10816497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Societal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented. The global community has been
crippled by a public health emergency that has had deleterious health and economic impacts, the scope of
which has yet to be determined. As a result of the current crisis, pregnant women and new mothers are
currently experiencing dramatic loss of medical, financial, and social support, resulting in higher rates of
emotional distress. It is well established that chronic stress can be embedded in the developing neurobiological
system, particularly during sensitive periods of life, but how the timing of maternal stressors and pathways
through which these experiences impact child neurobehavioral development are unclear. The central objective
of this proposal is to examine the association between perinatal COVID-19 stress and longitudinal postnatal
brain development, and to rigorously evaluate timing of exposure, underlying biological mechanisms and
postnatal protective factors. We will enroll 300 women and children from the New York City (NYC) COVID-19
Perinatal Experiences (COPE) cohort into a longitudinal protocol that will measure child biobehavioral
outcomes at 12-, 24-, and 36-months. The COPE cohort is comprised of more than 900 women that were
enrolled into a longitudinal assessment protocol at the height of the pandemic, approximately half of which
were pregnant (54%) and half of which were new mothers (46%). The primary aims of this project are to (i)
identify key windows of perinatal stress vulnerability; (ii) evaluate biological pathways that underlie associations
between maternal COVID-19 stressors and infant neurocognition; and (iii) isolate protective factors in the
postnatal environment that promote resilient outcomes in children exposed to extreme perinatal stress. We will
selectively recruit the proposed subsample for this study based on balance of timing of exposure, severity of
stressors, and sociodemographic factors. We will thus be able to meaningfully evaluate biological
consequences of perinatal stress with control over both timing and aggregate risk. Such work would constitute
a substantial advance in our understanding of the longitudinal effects of maternal perinatal stress on early
human brain development and would also offer potential avenues for promoting healthy outcomes in children
born at the height of history’s most significant perinatal stressor."

It is imperative to elucidate the roles that different microbes play in human health and diseases. However,
microbiome data from (either 16S rRNA gene or shotgun metagenomic) sequencing studies have unique and
complex features, including high-dimensionality, sparsity, overdispersion, compositionality, and experimental
bias. Existing statistical methods for hypothesis testing often fail to account for these features in full and thus
tend to yield false-positive results. The goal of this application is to develop robust and flexible statistical
methods that perform well in the presence of all data complexities, allow testing of various hypotheses (e.g.,
differential abundance, dynamic changes, mediation effects), and accommodate a wide range of datasets (e.g.,
continuous or discrete traits of interest, longitudinal data). To these ends, we propose the following specific
aims: (Aim 1) to develop a new framework for compositional analysis of differential abundance; (Aim 2) to
develop methods for controlling Monte-Carlo error rate in resampling-based multiple-hypotheses testing; (Aim
3) to develop methods for analyzing longitudinal data; (Aim 4) to develop a new framework for mediation
analysis of the microbiome; and (Aim 5) to develop and support a user-friendly software program implementing
the methods developed in Aims 1-4. We will evaluate these methods using extensive simulation studies and
multiple datasets from real microbiome studies at Emory University that we are actively involved in."
10823346,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – COHORT ADMINISTRATION & BIOREPOSITORY CORE
 A large body of data suggests that living on farms is associated with a decreased risk of asthma and atopic
diseases, including studies from Europe and the North America. The individual factors that appear to be
associated with this “farm-life effect” include consumption of unpasteurized farm milk and exposure to farm
animals and stables. Farm children have higher numbers of regulatory T cells, compared to urban children, and
their innate immune system also appears to be the target for these exposures. House dust in farm homes has
greater microbial diversity that is strongly negatively associated with the incidence of asthma. The studies thus
far have focused on outcomes of asthma at school-age. However, atopic dermatitis and food allergy commonly
precede development of respiratory allergies in a so-called “atopic march”. Our studies in the Old Order
Mennonite Community have indicated that they are at low risk for atopic diseases and the infant gut microbiome
composition is different from Rochester infants.
 The Cohort Admin and Biorepository Core will form the sample and data infrastructure for the distinct but
complementary Projects 1-3 of this U19 Program, “Biomarkers of Atopy Beginning Early” (BABE). The Core
will follow up and expand an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study of OOM neonates at a very low risk for atopic
dermatitis, food allergies, hayfever and asthma and Rochester neonates from atopic families with a high risk for
developing these atopic manifestations. We will test the overall hypothesis that infant gut microbiome associated
metabolic pathways and innate stimulation promote tolerance and barrier function in the OOM. The specific aims
of the Core are to Aim 1) sample and clinically follow up already recruited Cohort 1 infants until 6 years of age
for additional allergic diseases, Aim 2) recruit, sample and clinically follow up a similar cohort 2 of 120 infants
for the development of atopic dermatitis and food allergy until 24mo of age, and Aim 3) prepare, store and share
samples utilized in the Projects 1-3 (cord and infant peripheral blood, stool, skin swabs and tape strips) to assess
farming lifestyle effect on children's gut microbiome, innate and adaptive immune composition, and skin barrier
function and microbiome composition.
 These studies aim for novel strategies for primary and secondary prevention of early childhood allergic
diseases."
10823348,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – DATA MANAGEMENT & BIOINFORMATICS CORE
The Biomarkers of Atopy Beginning Early (“BABE”) U19 proposal seeks to compare how the immune system
develops in the first year of life in populations at high risk vs. low risk for allergic disease with an emphasis on
immunity at mucosal compartment, the site of exposure to allergens and the microbiome. Particularly, the
program compares urban Rochester infants; those who develop atopic diseases with Rochester infants protected
from atopic diseases and Old Order Mennonites (OOM), a population practicing traditional, single-family farming
with a low rate of AD and FA serve as an external comparison group for traditional, protective immune
development, in a birth cohort. The BABE consists of three individual projects and two cores, Cohort Admin and
Biorepository core and Data Management and Bioinformatics (DMB) core. BABE will collect large-scale high-
throughput data from our previously recruited cohort and a new cohort at multiple time-points within the first year
of life along with clinical endpoints. The high-throughput assays will be performed on cord blood, and infant stool,
blood, infant skin swabs and tape strips and infant buccal swabs. The data collected includes metabolites,
proteomics, transcriptomics, ATACseq, immune phenotyping, cytokine response, and microbiome (16S and
metagenomics). The DMB led by Dr. Juilee Thakar will support the data management, bioinformatics analysis
and complex data analysis needs of Projects 1, 2 and 3, and Cohort Admin and Biorepository core. In addition,
the core will collaborate with project investigators on experimental design and reporting, and provide a training
environment for project personnel on software tools and principles of methods and interpretation of results. By
making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), the DMB will maximize the impact and
optimize the path to identifying high impact insights. Specifically, DMB will: (1) Provide data collection, formatting
and storage infrastructure to facilitate data analysis and distribution across participating academic centers. (2)
Support sharing of data by submission to the ImmPort repository and other relevant public repositories (e.g.,
SRA, dbGAP, Metabolomics Workbench). (3) Provide bioinformatic and statistical support in experimental design
and data analysis. (4) Provide support for data integration across projects between each data type. (5) Develop
Integrated Score for Early Atopic Diseases (ISEAD). (6) Develop supervised and semi-supervised predictive
models for atopic and food allergy outcome. (7) Develop mechanistic dynamic models of infant immune
development and skin health. Thus, DMB will play a critical support role in ensuring success of BABE."
10823352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 1
Atopic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), allergic rhinitis, and asthma, are the most
common chronic medical conditions affecting children in the US, and prevention strategies remain largely
unsuccessful. While the risk of asthma is reduced in infants with a farming lifestyle, which includes exposure to
a diverse microbiome in early life, the microbial mechanisms of protection against AD and FA under this lifestyle
are still being investigated. Multiple bacterial metabolites have been also explored for their connection with atopic
disease: short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which can induce the differentiation of anti-inflammatory colonic Tregs,
tryptophan metabolism, which modulates epithelial barrier permeability, or bile acids, which regulate T-cell
differentiation in the lamina propria. Our published and preliminary results demonstrate that, compared to infants
from urban/suburban Rochester (ROC), the traditional agrarian community of Old Order Mennonites (OOM) are
protected against atopic diseases and harbor a distinct gut bacterial community, including an enrichment in
Bifidobacteria and Clostridia species, suggesting that lifestyle and early life microbiome accelerate
immunocompetence and might play a protective role in atopic diseases. The goals of this proposal are to
determine how the gut microbiome and its byproducts develop in infants to modulate the risk of atopic diseases,
to identify microbial and metabolite biomarkers to screen high-risk infants, and to assess mechanisms associated
with protective innate and adaptive immune markers and skin barrier integrity and microbiome by integration of
data with Projects 2 and 3. Our central hypothesis is that the microbiome of infants who do not develop
AD and FA modulates the bacterial metabolite pool that confers protection or risk of atopic disease. We
hypothesize that the gut microbiome of non-atopic urban Rochester infants and OOM infants will be enriched in
species with anti-inflammatory properties and genes related to short-chain fatty acid production, lactic acid
metabolism, and tryptophan and bile acid metabolism, as well as an accelerated gut microbiome maturation
compared with atopic infants. In parallel, we will also assess the fecal metabolome of OOM and ROC infants,
and test its association with atopic outcomes: we hypothesize that tryptophan, short-chain fatty acids and bile
acids will be differential between atopic and non-atopic infants, and that correlations between microbiome and
metabolome will also be differential based on health outcomes. Finally, we will evaluate the longitudinal
development of the gut microbiome and metabolome to identify groups of infants with similar changes over time
that are associated with atopic disease, as well as with biomarkers from Projects 2 and 3. The rational design of
our strategy will identify novel bacterial and metabolite biomarkers that are associated with protection or risk of
atopic disease, and which will facilitate the development of microbial interventions in the future."
10823358,"Atopic constitution starts shortly after birth with atopic dermatitis (AD) and sensitization to foods, which is an
important marker for the potential development of clinical food allergy (FA). A farming lifestyle has been
reproducibly associated with a reduced risk of asthma and atopic disease at school-age. Sustained microbial
exposure experienced when living on farms is proposed to confer protection through priming of innate immune
populations/receptors, whereas increased monocyte activation and hyper-responsive cytokine response to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was associated with increased risk of allergic asthma. Epigenetic
modifications in myeloid cells can lead to a change in functional potential to a second stimulus, either an
enhanced or suppressed response. This long-lived modification in immune potential, a concept known as trained
immunity, can lead to an array of functional outcomes, similar to the T cell differentiation outcomes that they
influence. Farmlife protection is also proposed to be mediated through expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cells.
Through epigenetic mechanisms or direct interaction with immune cells, microbial metabolites promote
generation of Tregs. This can reinforce tolerance through maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, which is
known to be compromised in skin in AD, facilitating epicutaneous allergen sensitization and in gastrointestinal
sites in FA. Despite several large birth cohorts, the early mechanisms and biomarkers of AD and FA are poorly
characterized, although the emerging strategies for prevention call for a need to identify those at risk.
 Our preliminary studies in the “Zooming in to Old Order Mennonites” (ZOOM)1 birth cohort identified novel
memory effector Th2 subpopulations in infancy as a marker of development of allergic sensitization in infants
born to Rochester urban families (ROC). In comparison, our studies found a higher frequency of gut-homing
(β7+) Tregs and Tregs that express TIGIT, an inhibitory co-stimulatory molecule, in infants from Old Order
Mennonites (OOM), a traditional agrarian community protected against atopic diseases. In addition, ROC infants
demonstrated a hyper-inflammatory monocyte response in cord blood. Utilizing samples and clinical data
collected under the already enrolled ZOOM1 cohort (n=160) and to be enrolled expansion cohort ZOOM 2
(n=120), we will be testing our central hypothesis that infants who will develop atopic diseases generate Th2-
skewed T cell populations in early infancy, whereas the protected infants develop gut-homing suppressive Tregs,
and monocytes hyporesponsive to LPS and viral targets. We have three specific aims: Aim 1 will assess
infant adaptive and innate immune markers in farming and urban lifestyles associated with protection
and atopic disease outcomes. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of T and innate cell transcriptome and
epigenome on atopic disease outcomes. Aim 3 will measure the association between gut barrier
function, farming lifestyle, and atopic diseases. Upon completion of this work, we expect to identify
mechanisms and biomarkers associated with anti-allergic immunity."
10823343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – OVERALL
Atopic dermatitis (AD) often precedes sensitization to food allergens and the development of clinical food allergy
(FA) due to compromised skin barrier function allowing allergen sensitization through skin. A large body of data
from Europe and North America suggest that living on farms is associated with a decreased risk of asthma and
atopic diseases. Asthma has been a focus of farming lifestyle studies; however, little is known about the
protective mechanisms of farming lifestyle on development of AD and FA which often precede respiratory
allergies and asthma. The farm lifestyle protection against allergic diseases comprises likely three prerequisites:
1) innate immune training and a modified immune response upon re-exposure, 2) generation of suppressive
regulatory T cells, and 3) preserved barrier function. Here, we propose to assess these preconditions in an
extended longitudinal birth cohort study among the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), a population practicing
traditional, single-family farming with a lower rate of asthma and allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis
and food allergies in early childhood. Biomarkers of Atopy Beginning Early (BABE) will test the overall
hypothesis that perturbed skin barrier function, immune millieu and microbiome drive the development of atopic
dermatitis, Th2 inflammation, allergic sensitization and FA, whereas a healthy gut microbiome modulates the
protective metabolite pool such as short chain fatty acids and tryptophan metabolites and protective Treg
immune development. Project 1 utilizes deep metagenomic sequencing to assess infant gut microbiome
composition and corresponding metabolome to show that OOM infant gut microbiome is distinct from urban
infants. Project 2 assesses markers of allergic sensitization and protective immune development utilizing
multiparameter spectral flow, unbiased clustering analysis and transcriptomic studies to demonstrate that urban
infants have a higher number of hyperinflammatory monocytes and Th2-skewed T cell subsets detected in early
infancy, whereas OOM have gut-homing memory Tregs. Project 3 will characterize skin barrier function,
microbiome and immune cell transcriptome. Our longitudinal birth cohort ZOOM1, funded by a U01 grant, is
now 2-5 years old and is a shared foundation for the three projects (78 OOM and 79 urban). We will add another
120 infants as a ZOOM2 cohort (80 urban and 40 OOM). We will also replicate key T cell biomarkers in larger
infant cohorts (Start Eating Early Diet ”SEED” and Microbiome and Allergic Asthma Precision Prevention
“MAAP2”). The infrastructure to recruit, collect and share samples and data is provided by the Cohort Admin &
Biorepository and Data Management & Bioinformatics Cores. The Admin Core will provide overall financial and
administrative infrastructure. These studies aim to identify biomarkers, mechanisms, and protective strategies
against atopic and food allergy."

current trajectory of NCI funding (>30% increase), peer-reviewed training and education project funding (21%
increase), treatment intervention accrual (44% increase), and productive and impactful membership recruitments
(10% increase in members). Successful investments in the prior grant period led to $8.3M ($740K CCSG)
towards the recruitment of 42 faculty. New UWCCC recruits have been awarded a total of approximately $103M
in sponsored research funding. Among the new UWCCC recruitments; 29 focus on center disease priorities; 35-
40% are underrepresented minorities (URMs), 21 hold peer-reviewed cancer funding; 11 hold NCI funding; 23
filled active leadership roles; 25 are placed in UWCCC space; and 30 are active Shared Resource users. CCSG
developmental funds will provide the Director with an ability to fiscally underwrite opportunities that further
strategic goals, which includes recruitments in immunotherapy; transdisciplinary theranostics; population
science, specifically in prevention; clinical informatics big data; and genomics translational science. UWCCC
CCSG developmental funds provided resources of $1.8M for 75 pilot projects that aligned with our prior strategic
plan goals. Going forward, pilot projects will be essential to catalyze inter- and intra-programmatic discovery.
Building on the success of an increase in P and U mechanism awards (133% increase), we anticipate CCSG
pilot funds focusing on cancer opportunities for additional program projects or SPORE applications. In addition,
an emerging critical mass of researchers in cancer immunotherapy might eventually lead to a new program in
this area. Therefore, pilots and start-up investments in immunotherapy are necessary for this goal in the UWCCC
strategic plan.
As a promotion of institutional authority, Dr. Bailey and the cancer center now (2022) have the authority
to initiate (with a departmental partner) 1-2 tenure track faculty searches per year based on UWCCC
priorities. Our center commits CCSG developmental funds for start-up support for faculty candidates who
provide the most promising opportunities for significant contributions to the scientific programs, our catchment,
our community, and to trainees. Our center actively recruits candidates who foster and promote the values
of diversity and inclusion. UWCCC’s predominant catchment diseases, and subsequent priority investments,
include the following: prostate, breast, head and neck, and blood cancers, including leukemia and myeloma.
Going forward the center will place greater emphasis on inter-programmatic activities, disease specific pilot
opportunities, and scientific retreat programming meant to stimulate research opportunities in disease priorities."

Aim 2 is to engage UW leaders to secure institutional support for the UWCCC SRs. SRM works closely with
leaders within the School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and other UW leaders to secure/sustain
institutional support, minimize redundancies in services existing across the UW campus, and leverage the
immense scale of the UW research enterprise when negotiating with equipment, supply, and service vendors.
Aim 3 is to develop and implement effective marketing and evaluation tools and strategies. These tools and
strategies educate our membership and the entire UW research community of our SRs’ services, technical
capabilities, and expertise, and inform our SR faculty leaders and managers and UWCCC leadership of the value
of the services provided by our SRs and the changing needs of our member users. Approximately 90% of all
UWCCC program members utilized one or more of our SRs during the 2017-2021 CCSG cycle. Member SR
users collectively held 735 cancer-relevant research grants totaling $75.7 million on December 31, 2021,
including 130 awards from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) totaling $26 million in annual direct costs. Survey
data indicate our SRs are highly valued by the UWCCC and broader UW research communities and virtually all
our members indicate their research programs would be severely compromised if our SRs did not exist. Our SRs
received the aggregate merit rating of outstanding at the 2017 review of the CCSG. Since that review, the
UWCCC and our UW partners have established 3 new SRs, reorganized/expanded/enhanced all remaining SRs,
and invested more than $32 million to support SR operations, enhance SR infrastructure, and optimally align SR
capabilities to the needs of our members."
10817705,"Project Summary
Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) are associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Treatment options for patients with ILD are limited by a lack of understanding of the
pathophysiologic mechanisms. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, the main epithelial progenitor stem cell population in
the lung, are critically important in ILD pathophysiology as they regulate surfactant production and operate as
stem cell progenitors for repair of alveoli after injury via generation of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. Disruptions to
the DNA, protein, organellar quality control, and cell metabolism have all been hypothesized to underlie AT2-cell
driven ILD. Recent insights on the AT2 cell states and differentiation trajectories led to the discovery of primed
and cycling AT2 (pAT2 and cAT2) cell subpopulation(s) and alveolar differentiation intermediate (ADI) cells,
which convert into AT1 cells during lung injury. However, the global regulatory mechanisms that contribute to
dysregulated AT2 cell homeostasis and the relationship to impaired AT2 progenitor stem cell renewal are not
well understood. In preliminary work, we found that conditional inactivation of let-7 microRNA clusters specifically
in alveolar AT2 cells in mice promotes spontaneous age-dependent parenchymal remodeling with features of
ILD including pronounced septal alveolar thickening, fibroblastic foci with collagen deposition and pronounced
alveolitis. We also found that let-7 promotes hyperplasia of AT2 cells and the appearance of ADI transitional
cells with a cellular senescence profile. Based on transcriptomic data hypothesize that the let-7 family of
microRNAs serves as an essential coordinator of AT2 cell autophagy & lipid homeostasis, progenitor stem cell
renewal, and AT1 differentiation. In this proposal, we will extend these exciting findings to (1) determine how the
let-7 pathway regulates AT2 progenitor stem cell trajectories and cell differentiation dynamics during ILD; (2)
determine how let-7 pathway impairs AT2 cell surfactant homeostasis and contributes to alterations in autophagy
and lipid metabolism during ILD remodeling; and (3) identify mechanism(s) through which let-7 controls AT2 cell
renewal in mice and humans. The project will elucidate a fundamental repair and regeneration process in the
lung and pave the way for new targetable pathways for drug discovery in the context of IPF."

The brain is built on billions of neural connections in a highly organized 3D hierarchy. At the same time, neural
activity is highly dynamics that requires kilohertz imaging rate to capture action potentials and sub-threshold
voltage signals, the fundamental bit for neural communication. While the recent advent of genetically encoded
voltage indicators (GEVIs) makes it possible to optically record the neural membrane voltage, the technical
challenges are profound in imaging millimeter-scale volumetric voltage imaging at kilohertz with cellular
resolution. In this proposal, we aim to address the challenges by developing a one-photon mesoscopic (i.e.
millimeter scale field of view, FOV) volumetric voltage imaging, using mesoscopic oblique plane microscopy
(Meso-OPM). Our technique will image >1.8 mm2 FOV, >0.1 mm depth penetration at 1 KHz, capable of
recording voltage signals across an entire nervous system of a Zebrafish larva. The bright and stable GEVIs
Voltron with JF525 dye will be used in our proposed work. Meso-OPM is a variant of light sheet microscopy
(LSM), with a single primary objective lens instead of two in conventional LSM. The simplified optical design
allows 1) leveraging high photon efficiency in LSM; 2) integrating ultra-fast passive optical scanning to achieve >1
MHz frame rate; and 3) flexible optical designs for millimeter FOV and cellular resolution. In addition to the
technical challenges for large-scale ultrafast 3D imaging, the effective data processing pipeline for massive data
is also highly desirable. To this end, we propose a robust and efficient deep learning framework to perform self-
supervised 4D denoising and neuron segmentation. The pipeline enable massive data processing at 10 volume
per second for the downstream neuroscience studies. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of proposed techniques,
we will image Zebrafish in response to optic flow by a drifting grating visual stimuli. We will identify neural circuitry
responsible to the motion compensation to the optic flow (i.e. maintaining body position when presented drifting
grating) from eyes all the way to spinal cord. Altogether, this proposal will greatly improve our capability of
dissecting large-scale neural circuitry, and the sub-sequent modeling and creation of artificial neural circuits."
10892936,"Delirium (acute disturbance in mental status) occurs in 46-56% of persons living with dementia (PLWDs)
during hospitalization. Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are among the strongest risk factors
for developing delirium during hospitalization. Although an off-label use, antipsychotic medications (APMs) are
the most commonly used pharmacotherapy to manage psychological symptoms of delirium. Because PLWDs
often have a prolonged recovery course from delirium due to acute illness, ~30% of the patients who newly
initiate an APM during hospitalization are discharged with them, and >60% of those discharged with an APM
persist for >6 weeks. Since APMs may cause numerous life-threatening adverse reactions, it is critical to
discontinue them after hospitalization in a timely fashion. However, several critical knowledge gaps limit the
necessary evidence generation to guide such a deprescribing process: 1) There is currently no direct data from
randomized control trials (RCT) on discontinuation of APMs used for delirium because it is extremely difficult to
recruit and consent PLWDs or their healthcare proxies when the patient is in an acute delirious state to
participate in an RCT, and any interventional study would severely underrepresent frail PLWDs seen in routine
care. 2) In the non-randomized settings, adjusting for confounding is challenging when comparing different
deprescribing strategies of a medication used for acute delirium, and the detailed clinical information required
for such analyses is not typically available in routine care data. Our objective is to establish an analytical
framework that enables valid causal effect estimation comparing continuation and multiple deprescribing
strategies (e.g., abrupt discontinuation vs. gradual dose reduction) of APMs in PLWDs with delirium after
hospitalization. We will integrate electronic health records (EHR), national claims data, and multiple clinical
assessment data, covering >502,000 PLWDs from 2013 to 2026, and employ high-dimensional machine-
learning aided confounding adjustment and phenotyping algorithms. Our specific aims include 1) To integrate
EHR with Medicare claims data, Minimum Data Set (MDS), Outcomes and Assessment Information Set
(OASIS), and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) and to develop novel
algorithms to determine key clinical phenotypes; 2) To assess APM utilization/discontinuation patterns and risk
factors of prolonged use of APMs for delirium in PLWDs after hospitalization; 3) To assess the health impact of
different discontinuation strategies (considering the amount and rate of dose reduction) of APMs vs. continuing
APMs in PLWDs with delirium after hospitalization. The subgroup effects by key clinical phenotypes, typical vs.
atypical APMs, and type of admission will also be determined. This proposal will generate evidence reflecting
routine care delivery to inform post-discharge APM management in PLWDs with delirium. It will also establish a
generalizable analytical framework assessing the health effects of deprescribing pharmacotherapies for
delirium with detailed treatment effect heterogeneity evaluation necessary for precision medicine."
10837065,"In exchange for eliminating repeated and extended time in infusion units, cancer survivors (people from the
diagnosis to end of life) on oral anti-cancer agents must self-manage their symptoms (e.g., fatigue, depression,
skin rash). In this hybrid type 1 effectiveness implementation trial, we test an adaptive symptom management
intervention delivered in English or Spanish. It consists of the 12-week Automated Telephone Symptom
Management (ATSM) to address common cancer- and treatment-related symptoms and the 8-week Telephone
Interpersonal Counseling (TIPC) to address psychological distress. The ATSM consists of weekly monitoring of
symptoms using the Patient Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-
CTCAE) via highly accessible telephone-based interactive voice response (IVR), with summary IVR reports
sent to oncology providers and direction to use a printed Handbook for elevated symptoms. When self-
management is not sufficient to reduce depression or anxiety, the 8-week TIPC delivered by social workers via
telehealth is added to the ATSM. The concept for this project has been approved by NRG Oncology’s National
Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). Twelve NCORP sites will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to the
12-week adaptive ATSM+TIPC or active control of IVR symptom monitoring with reports to clinicians (no
Handbook, no TIPC), with 516 survivors on oral anti-cancer treatment nested within sites. The specific aims
are to:
1. Test the effectiveness of ATSM+TIPC versus active control with respect to survivor-level outcomes of: a)
The summary toxicity index of 24 PRO-CTCAE symptoms (primary) that include depressive, anxiety, and other
symptoms commonly experienced during oral anti-cancer treatment over weeks 1-12 (immediate effect) and
13-17 (sustained effect); b) Unscheduled health services use (secondary) over weeks 1-12 and 13-17. We
hypothesize that primary and secondary outcomes will be better (lower) in the ATSM+TIPC than active control.
2. Evaluate implementation outcomes at the clinician level (physicians, nurses, social workers, other):
a) Feasibility as reflected by clinicians’ time to address weekly IVR symptom reports.
b) Clinician’s actions on symptom reports (symptom-related oncology visits, oral agent treatment alterations,
prescriptions of supportive care medications, referrals to supportive care services).
c) Treatment fidelity of TIPC delivered by social workers in the ATSM+TIPC arm and time spent by them.
d) Clinician’s perceptions of intervention acceptability and appropriateness for the community oncology clinic.
3. Estimate delivery cost of the ATSM+TIPC and active control and cost savings for the ATSM+TIPC versus
active control as a result of reduced unscheduled health services use.
This trial will inform the implementation and dissemination of the ATSM+TIPC intervention in the community-
based oncology settings to improve symptom management for survivors undergoing oral anti-cancer treatment."

The Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) and the University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) in partnership with the Los Angeles Community College District propose the Engaging Students in
Aging Research (ESAR) Program. Racial/ethnic minorities are severely underrepresented in the scientific
workforce due to a myriad of local and systemic barriers, including a lack of exposure to biomedical research
activities during their secondary and tertiary education. There is a critical need to motivate and equip lower-
income underrepresented racial/ethnic minority (URM) community college (CC) students with the academic
skill set to critically understand, explore and engage in aging-related scientific research. The Program’s main
components include: 1) An Aging Research and Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR)
Fundamentals Institute, where ESAR trainees will familiarize themselves with research fundamentals and
participate in hands-on aging-related CBPR under the supervision of a research mentor and a community
faculty advocate, and 2) A Pathway to Research Careers Continuum, where students attend workshops which
will enhance their research and academic skills. Since California Community Colleges are the single largest
system of higher education in the country, the proposed ESAR Program will provide important opportunities for
URM community college students to receive research training as well as skills necessary to transfer to four-
year colleges/universities. The Program’s overarching goal is to increase the number of URM students
prepared to pursue careers in aging-related sciences and research. The Specific Aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Provide mentored support and leverage aging-related resources of existing research training programs
at CDU and UCLA to propel URM CC students in their trajectory as aging scientists, by implementing:
 Aim 1a: An innovative triadic mentorship model pairing ESAR trainees with: i) a Faculty Member in aging
research, ii) a Community Faculty Aging Advocate, and iii) a Near-Peer Mentor. This mentorship model will
provide multidisciplinary, methodological, academic, and community-partnered support for ESAR trainees to
amplify interest in and develop research skills for a career in aging research.
 Aim 1b: Immersion of ESAR trainees in an aging-focused CBPR tailored research experience centered on
the improvement of health outcomes among URM older adults in under-resourced communities.
Aim 2: Deliver long-term educational guidance and support for ESAR trainees to 1) transfer to a four-year
college/university and 2) pursue graduate and/or doctoral studies in a STEM field within aging research.
Aim 3: Implement an evaluation and monitoring plan to continually assess and improve the effectiveness of the
ESAR program, emphasizing: i) recruitment and retention of promising URM CC students, ii) quality of
educational and mentoring plans focused on aging-related research, iii) successful matriculation into
undergraduate STEM programs, and iv) ESAR trainee-led dissemination of community-driven scientific results."

The overarching goal of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Raise Awareness In Students
Early (RAISE) Host and Microbe Program is to increase the number of qualified individuals from groups
underrepresented in the biomedical and clinical workforce who pursue a graduate STEM degree and career that
bridges microbiology and immunology. To accomplish this goal, the RAISE Program will provide research
experience and academic enrichment that authentically serve underrepresented students in ways that
achieve retention, equity, access, and life-changing outcomes for students. The program will support nine
students from economically and/or socially disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented ethnic and racial
groups. Students will be recruited from the Southeast with priority given to applicants from South Carolina non-
research-intensive higher education institutions including Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
The RAISE program will: 1) recruit diverse undergraduate students who demonstrate ambition and determination
to pursue a graduate-level STEM degree; 2) implement a summer training program that will prepare students for
graduate/professional school admission and a biomedical research career; 3) nurture the professional growth of
students and enhance their integration into the academic culture and community; 4) implement a support
program to assist students during the transition from undergraduate to graduate/professional school, and 5)
conduct a process and outcome evaluation to ensure the program responds to emerging needs and meets the
students’ short term and long term objectives. Dr. Yilmaz, DDS, PhD. and Dr. Westwater, PhD. with their
complementary backgrounds in academic mentoring bring forth an integrated undergraduate program
encompassing basic science, clinical knowledge, and team-based leadership. During the 10-week
summer program students will conduct a biomedical hypothesis-driven project under the guidance of a faculty
mentor whose research program is aligned with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
scientific priorities. Training will include academic skills development, scientific communication, professional
networking, work-life management skills, and responsible conduct of research training. Trainees will gain an
appreciation for the translational relevance of their studies through interprofessional experiences in a clinical
setting. The program will culminate with a formal presentation at the MUSC Summer Undergraduate Research
Symposium, a one-day conference in which students present their research to their peers and mentors. Each
student will be paired via the Big Sister/Brother Program with a graduate student, who will provide professional
and social support while on the MUSC campus. Students’ will continue to receive career advancement support
after graduating from the program through the RAISE Alumni Network. Ultimately, the program will prepare the
next generation of skilled, rigorous, and creative scientists who will improve the Nations capacity to address and
eliminate health disparities related to infectious disease and diseases of the immune system."

The proposed Training in Environmental Neuroscience (TEN) is a program based at Florida International
University (FIU), a designated Carnegie Tier I Research University and Hispanic Serving Institution. FIU has a
significant majority (77%) from historically underrepresented populations. Therefore, FIU has a proven record of
recruiting, retaining and graduating minority students, and a leadership committed to providing institutional
resources to ensure successful student outcomes. The TEN program aims to provide training to a new generation
of interdisciplinary scientists working at the unique interface of environmental health and neuroscience termed
Environmental Neuroscience. As the burden of neurological disease and disorders increases at an alarming
rate, especially among underserved minorities, environmental factors are recognized as significant determinants.
Thus, there is an urgent need for a new generation of scientists, especially from Underrepresented Minorities,
trained at the interface of environmental health and neuroscience. The existing Brain, Behavior, and Environment
(BBE) center at FIU is uniquely poised to provide this research training and provides strong institutional support
and home for the proposed program. As a designated Emerging Preeminent Program at FIU, BBE brings
together faculty and students from the Robert Stempel College of Public Health, The College of Arts, Sciences
and Education, the College of Engineering and Computing. The mission of the proposed TEN program is to
provide talented and motivated predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees with rigorous didactic and laboratory
training in contemporary environmental health and neuroscience. Program Objectives are for trainees to 1)
acquire fundamental knowledge in environmental health and neuroscience; 2) become proficient at
integrating concepts of environmental health and neuroscience into cutting edge basic, clinical, and
translational research; and 3) gain the necessary skills and tools to leverage this unique training to
achieve their next career objective. The Program proposes to support a cohort of 2 pre- and 2-post-doctoral
trainees in Year 1, increasing to 3 pre- and 3 post-doctoral trainees/year thereafter. The core curriculum for PhD
students includes didactic coursework in environmental neuroscience, environmental health, neuroscience,
neurotoxicology, advanced methods in neuroscience/neurotoxicology and research design and analysis. This
didactic training is complemented by career development activities, training in Responsible Conduct of Research
and Rigor and Reproducibility, and programmatic/networking opportunities. Postdoctoral trainees will also
participate in selected components of the didactic program, depending upon their background, and be provided
with additional career development activities. At the end of the program, trainees will have a deep
understanding of interdisciplinary Environmental Neuroscience research, demonstrated ability to carry
out independent research in this challenging multidisciplinary area, and achieved state-of-the-art
preparation for this rapidly evolving discipline."
10831845,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of death among teenagers in the United States. Teen drivers who have committed a traffic violation are at even greater risk. However, most parent-focused interventions target teen drivers during the learner phase, with very few interventions being implemented during the unsupervised independent driving phase or targeting high-risk teen drivers, such as those with traffic violations. Advances in technology, ranging from in-vehicle devices to smartphone applications, offer a new avenue to enhance teens’ safe driving. However, little is known about how to use this technology to actively engage parents, and subsequently, influence teens’ safe driving practices. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of providing driving feedback (with and without parent training) on reducing risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors, and recidivism (subsequent traffic violation) among high-risk teen drivers. Our central hypothesis is that driving feedback via a technological device and app will reduce risky driving events and behaviors, and that augmenting feedback with parent training will further improve outcomes. We will test the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the effects of the intervention on reducing teens’ risky driving events and unsafe driving behaviors; Aim 2: Determine the effects of the intervention on increasing frequency and quality of parent-teen communication about safe driving practices; and Aim 3: Determine the effects of the intervention on decreasing teen traffic violation recidivism. We will enroll teen drivers (age 16 to 17 years) who committed a moving violation along with their parents/legal guardians (n=240 dyads) from the Ohio Franklin County Juvenile Traffic Court following the teens’ mandatory court hearing. Enrolled parent-teen dyads will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (n=80 dyads/group): Group 1, control group with no device feedback nor parent training; Group 2, device feedback to teens only, providing no feedback nor training to parents; or Group 3, device feedback to teens and parents, who will also receive individualized virtual training with a traffic safety communication specialist. The expected outcome will establish the effectiveness of in-vehicle driving feedback technology augmented with parent training in reducing risky driving events, unsafe driving behaviors and recidivism. Our project is significant because it targets safe driving among high-risk teens who have committed a traffic violation. The study is innovative because it partners with the local court system and utilizes novel in-vehicle technologies to provide objectively measured study outcomes. The findings of this study will have a significant impact on juvenile traffic court’s practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving safety by reducing crashes, injuries, and deaths."

prevention and diagnosis, as well as the development of novel effective addiction therapeutics. The objective
of this renewal application plans to provide 4 predoctoral training slots (for 1-2 yrs each, starting in the 2nd yr) in
the Weill Cornell Graduate School (WCGS) Neuroscience and Pharmacology Programs with the rationale of
understanding the impact of genes and environment on drug addiction. A unique feature of this training plan is
the diversity of faculty expertise in both genetic (e.g. sex, single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene splice
variants and epigenetics) and environmental (e.g., HIV positivity, materal environment, developmental age)
factors that are essential for the emergence of addictive disease. Our faculty is also noteworthy for the breadth
of the approaches they bring to addiction science; we have expertise in studying how several major abused
drugs (i.e. alcohol, opiates, cocaine, and other psychostimulants) impact neuronal function from the expression
and behavior of single molecules to the performance of complex functional systems that regulate the behavior
of rodents and humans. In addition to our talented faculty, this training grant will take advantage of the WCGS
outstanding research environment, educational resources, and recruiting activities, particularly our history of
attracting and training under-represented minorities as basic and clinical scientists. Particular strengths of the
training grant include: 1) the experience of the Director and Co-Director in mentoring, teaching and drug abuse
research; 2) the broad scope of multidisciplinary research training provided by the faculty; 3) extensive
collaborations and co-mentoring between the faculty; 4) the strong emphasis on “bench-to- bedside”
translational research; and 5) established initiatives for promoting diversity and inclusion. Training grant faculty
will be divided into three groups: 1) Major Sponsors: thesis mentors with NIDA mission supported research
programs; 2) Minor Sponsors: individuals with NIDA-mission interests who will collaborate with Major Sponsors
and their trainees; 3) Training Sponsors: individuals with extensive experience in drug abuse research who will
work closely with Major Sponsors and their trainees. Beyond the laboratory, key activities of the training plan
inlcude: 1) courses designed specifically for this T32 (“Addiction and Society” and “Challenges in Pain
Management”); 2) drug abuse focused retreat; 3) WCGS developed programs in fellowhsip preparation; and 4)
training experiences in teaching, mentoring, networking and career opportunites. These activities together with
the existing coursework and curricula, symposia and lectures, as well as each students individual training plan,
will provide a solid foundation for promoting the development of sucessful transitions of 12-15 PhD students
over a period of 5 years into careers in the biomedical workforce."
10846582,"Abstract
 Optical methods provide high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of neural function, ranging
from single neurons to entire populations, in the intact brain. Nevertheless, limited penetration depth,
spatial scale and temporal resolution remain the main challenges for optical imaging. Laser scanning
multiphoton microscopy is the main technology used for cellular-level imaging in scattering brains.
Because of the point scanning nature of laser scanning microscopy, the speed of the optical scanner
determines the imaging speed, even when there is sufficient signal strength for fast imaging. For
inertially dependent scanners like galvanometers and resonant scanners, increasing the scan speed
requires decreasing the moment of inertia of the dynamic component, while the need for high spatial
resolution requires increasing the aperture of the scan mirror. The balancing of these two conflicting
requirements has limited commercially available galvanometer scanners at approximately the same
speed for the last 30 to 40 years. The focus of this proposal is to demonstrate a new concept that will
improve the scan speed of galvanometer-based optical scanners (galvo-scanners), and increasing the
imaging speed of laser scanning microscopy. The proposed new concept leverages the uniaxial nature
of galvanometer scanning, i.e., a galvo-scanner scans one spatial dimension only, which leaves the
orthogonal dimension free for manipulation. By using a cylindrical lens to focus the beam onto the scan
mirror along the axial direction of the galvanometer (i.e., the non-scanning direction) and another
cylindrical lens to recollimate the beam after scanning, we can reduce the size of the scan mirror
dramatically along the non-scanning direction. The resulting reduction in mirror mass and moment of
inertia will increase the scan speed without reducing the scanned field-of-view and spatial resolution.
The proposed program dovetails with our effort in developing technologies for brain imaging. We will
test and validate the new scanners in laser scanning 2-photon and 3-photon microscopes for in vivo
recording of mouse brain activity. The successful completion of this program will create new optical
scanners that will improve the imaging speed of all galvo-based laser scanning microscopes. Since the
design, test and demonstration are all based on typical multiphoton microscopes, the new concept can
be immediately translated to other research labs. Furthermore, we will work with commercial instrument
builders to accelerate the research and adoption of the technology developed in this program."
10841639,"Project Summary
Splicing is the process of removing intronic regions from a precursor messenger RNA (mRNA) and combining
exons into a mature transcript. Alternative splicing results in differential intron removal, producing multiple
alternatively spliced isoforms arising from a common precursor mRNA. The dysregulation of splicing is estimated
to underlie at least 15% of human diseases, and is likely to contribute to many more. Splice reactions are
performed by the spliceosome, an RNA protein complex that is assembled onto precursor mRNA in stages. The
final activity of the spliceosome is influenced by a combination of trans-acting spliceosome factors and cis
elements within the precursor mRNA. However, factors involved in cis element function, like sequence motifs
and RNA structure folds, are not fully understood, and a majority of such elements remain unidentified. This is
particularly true for branchpoint selection, an essential early stage of spliceosome assembly within the intron
around the catalytic adenosine. Although the branchpoint is loosely recognized as a highly degenerate sequence
motif, it influences downstream splice site selection. My first goal is to elucidate the impact of RNA structure
on branchpoint selection by focusing on RNA structure-mediated binding by the spliceosome
associated SF3B complex. To do so, I will develop RNA secondary structure models for SF3B-dependent
precursor RNAs to identify enriched structural motifs. My work will entail the first large-scale derivation of intronic
secondary structures, including branchpoint regions, which will aid in better understanding of how RNA structures
around cis regulatory elements influence splicing. My second goal is to develop a system to identify cis
splicing regulatory elements and rapidly test their functional significance. To identify regulatory elements,
I will identify cis features on mRNAs, including protein binding sites, conservation and RNA secondary structure,
and use machine learning to discover novel signatures of functionally relevant cis regulatory regions. The
functional impact of such sites on alternative splicing will be experimentally tested through use of antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO) that can block or inhibit the regulatory region. I will set up a positive feedback loop where
I can predict cis splice regulatory elements and immediately test their impact on splicing with ASOs, incorporating
the test results back into the model to improve predictions. This system will lead to accurate prediction of cis
regulatory splicing elements within any gene of interest. Accurate identification of cis elements will improve our
ability to understand co-regulation of alternative splicing. The long-term vision of my research is to demystify
the splicing code by clarifying the role of RNA structure in splicing and developing a powerful system to identify
functional cis regulatory splicing elements and test their activity."

Hypertension (HTN) is a prevalent cardiovascular condition and a leading risk factor for other cardiovascular
diseases. If it remains untreated, HTN can lead to numerous comorbidities such as stroke, dementia, diabetes,
kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and neurological disorders. Despite advances in prevention and multi-
drug therapy, a significant proportion of patients remain resistant or refractory to current treatments. In most
cases, treatment-resistant HTN is strongly neurogenic, characterized by a dysfunctional autonomic nervous
system (ANS) most recently linked to gut dysbiosis. However, mechanisms of host-microbiota interaction in HTN
are not well defined. Our new preliminary data suggests that a breakdown in the neural gut-brain communication
resulting from gut dysbiosis may be mediated by reduced serotonergic receptor signaling on the vagal afferent
projections from the gut to the nucleus of the solitary tract. In this application, we propose to use state of the art
in vivo imaging, electrophysiology and neural stimulation approaches in transgenic and humanized rats in order
to interrogate specific molecular and neural mechanisms of host-microbiota interaction in health and HTN, while
evaluating the potential of sub-diaphragmatic vagal stimulation for bio-electronic medicine to alleviate the
symptoms of gut dysbiosis in HTN."

This is the competitive renewal of a T32 training program, the Research Training Fellowship in Substance
Abuse Program (RTFSA-P), which has been in existence since 1988. Despite recent advances in
understanding the neurobiology of addiction, there is a persistent gap in the application of knowledge gained
from basic science studies to clinical practice in the field of addiction. A new generation of behavioral,
psychopharmacology, neuroimaging, molecular genetics and molecular neuroscience studies has broad
clinical implications and these studies bring the potential to bridge the gap between basic and clinical research.
Despite the quality of the available science, actual progress in bridging this gap depends also upon the
availability of appropriately trained young scientists. The purpose of the RTFSA-P is to meet this need by
providing post-doctoral training for a total of 4 physicians or PhDs interested in careers in translational or
intervention research in the field of addiction. The proposed RTFSA-P is a two-year program in the Division
of Addictions (DA), Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine, and will afford post-doctoral trainees
the opportunity to devote virtually full-time effort, during the initial phase of their careers, to developing the
skills and experience needed to become independent researchers in the field of clinical or translational
research in substance use disorders. The DA is an ongoing, stable addiction research program that now
encompasses over 123 major funded projects including 4 Centers covering a broad scope of topics and
research methodologies. This facilitates research that moves rapidly and in both directions from preclinical
projects (“bench”) to clinical studies (“bedside” and “community”). Applicants will be MDs or PhD post-doctoral
candidates trained in specialties that include psychiatry, internal medicine, clinical psychology, or
neuroscience. Candidates will be selected by an admission committee based on their potential for excellence
in the field of translational or intervention research in addictions. The RTFSA-P program includes (1)
individualized research preceptorship, (2) successful completion of a translational-research project, (3) a core
curriculum, which includes seminars on addiction clinical research and treatment, biostatistics and research
design, the responsible conduct of scientific research and grant writing skills and (4) individualized participation
in seminars of interest in the Department, Medical School and University. The training facilities include the
major institutions affiliated with Yale School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry. At the conclusion of
training, applicants will be well suited for independent careers in translational or intervention research in the
field of addiction."

potential of this approach to improve surgical decision-making during TORS without modifying conventional
clinical protocols; and c) the utility of FLIM-derived parameters detecting biochemical and metabolic
characteristics to distinguish oral and oropharyngeal cancer in real-time from surrounding normal tissue in
patients in-situ.. We also developed innovative methods for real-time dynamic augmentation of imaging
parameters on the surgical field of view. Capitalizing on the major accomplishments and knowledge gained under
the current R01, the overarching objective of this renewal application is to 1) demonstrate FLIm’s diagnostic
value in prospective studies by accounting for biological/experimental variables identified as critical under the
current R01 and leveraging pre-operative imaging and clinical information and 2) enhance the visualization of
FLIm-based classifiers on the surgeon console for real-time intraoperative feedback. To accomplish our overall
objective, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1. Expand the FLIm database and develop tissue-type classifiers
(retrospective analysis) accounting for biological variables (e.g., patient age/sex, tumor origin/location) and
experimental situations (e.g., epithelial surface vs deep margins, tumors of an unknown primary) and the pre-
operative imaging (CT, PET) features used in surgical planning. Aim 2. Develop, validate and perform regulatory
activities for enhanced FLIm data visualization in support of prospective clinical studies. Aim 3. Validate FLIm as
a means of real-time intraoperative TORS guidance in a prospective study analysis.
In summary, this study will demonstrate the clinical feasibility and utility of FLIm for intraoperative real-time
assessment of oral and oropharyngeal cancer surgical margins. The acquired FLIm parameter database will
enable subsequent large clinical trials for automated tissue classification and diagnostic prediction. While the
focus of this application is on TORS surgeries, the label-free FLIm-based tissue assessment, characterized by
simple, fast and flexible data acquisition and display, can be broadly applied to other procedures as the da Vinci
Surgical System is used in a wide range of tumor surgeries including urologic, colorectal, gynecologic, and
thoracic cancers."

The Long-run Impacts of Natural Disasters on Mortality and Disease Burden among US Elderly and
Disabled Adults
Natural disasters have increased in frequency and severity in recent decades, a trend projected to intensify
under climate change. The risks these disasters pose to individual health and well-being are heightened among
older adults with age-related disabilities or chronic illness, such as those living with Alzheimer’s disease or
dementia. Public policies regarding disaster preparedness and response serve an important role in avoiding or
reducing the health impacts of disasters and improving individual health resiliency. The optimal design of these
policies depends crucially on quantifying the short- and long-run health risks imposed by disasters, precisely
identifying the most vulnerable populations, and understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive and
mediate outcomes. However, much remains unknown about these important dimensions. This project will use
individual-level administrative Medicare data on all elderly (65+) and long-term disabled beneficiaries from 1992–
2017 to estimate the short- and long-run effects of a broad range of natural disasters – such as hurricanes,
tornadoes, and floods – on health, health care use, and health-related expenditures among the elderly. The
study will compile a comprehensive and spatially detailed database of US natural disasters from a variety of data
sources. The Medicare data provide the 9-digit ZIP code of residence, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
location of victims more precisely than prior research. The project will track individuals living in disaster-affected
areas before the disaster regardless of where they move, and a control group of unaffected elderly will be used
to establish how outcomes would have evolved in the absence of the event. The project will also use a new
machine learning approach to identify vulnerable subpopulations based on individual health characteristics (e.g.,
pre-existing chronic conditions), demographic traits (e.g., age, race, sex), and local economic and public health
circumstances (e.g., per capita income, prevalence of obesity, community participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program's Community Rating System). The project will also assess several continuity-of-care
mechanisms that could moderate or exacerbate post-disaster mortality and disease impacts, including damage
to health care facilities, loss of access to one’s physician, and health plan network restrictions. This analysis will
be performed for the whole population of beneficiaries and for subpopulations thought to be particularly
vulnerable to continuity-of-care disruptions, like adults with multiple pre-existing chronic conditions. Finally, the
project will estimate the extent to which certain characteristics (e.g., health care availability, local government
expenditure, and healthy behaviors) in areas where victims relocate to following a disaster can explain their
health outcomes."
10835972,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease leading to pancreatic beta cell destruction and lifelong
dependence on exogenous insulin injections. Immunomodulatory agents that aim to reverse beta cell
autoimmunity have been shown to delay T1D diagnosis but cannot halt the decline of C-peptide levels that
reflect insulin production. Autologous cell therapy (ACT) is an investigational therapy that aims to restore the
immune set point back to tolerance by infusion of ex vivo expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are
responsible for downregulating the immune response and their absence in animal models of diabetes leads to
accelerated disease progression. Early clinical trials of ACT, however, show that transfused Tregs persist for
years in patients but were ineffective in preventing C-peptide decline.
 This project proposes to generate islet specific T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells from Tregs through gene
editing to improve their utility as ACT for T1D. Tfr cells are a specialized subset of Tregs that act in the
germinal centers of lymph nodes where mature B cells are activated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Early B
cell activation is an important step in T1D prognosis as the detection of class-switched islet autoantibodies in
the pre-diabetic phase predicts onset of disease. Therefore, creating Tfr-like cells represents a potential
avenue of T1D prevention through suppression of Tfh-mediated activation.
 The following Specific Aims outline the objectives for utilizing genome targeting to produce Tfr-like cells
as potential cellular therapies of T1D. In Aim 1, islet reactive Tregs will be produced through non-viral genome
editing to knock in islet reactive TCR in the TCR locus. Engineered Tregs will be tested in vitro for islet antigen
reactivity and tested in vivo through adoptive transfer into NOD mice to determine its effects on diabetes
incidence. In Aim 2, the Tfr cell characteristic chemokine receptor CXCR5 will be knocked in the Rosa26 locus
of islet reactive Tregs and tested for responsivity to CXCL13. Engineered CXCR5-positive islet reactive Tregs
will be transferred into NOD mice to assess diabetes incidence and Treg trafficking to the pancreas and
pancreatic lymph nodes.
 The proposed training will take place at the University of Florida Diabetes Institute under the guidance of
Dr. Todd Brusko and Dr. Michael Haller. The training plan will provide the applicant with research design and
technical skills in autoimmunity, cell engineering, and diabetes models as well as professional skills in teaching
and scientific writing to facilitate growth as an independent investigator."
10792902,"SUMMARY: PROJECT 3 - IMMUNOLOGY
The quality of the host immune response to Clostridioides difficile infection is one of the strongest predictors of
disease severity. Despite the protective capacity of the host immune response, the immune parameters that
promote immunity remain poorly understood. Approximately 25-35% of patients that recover from primary C.
difficile infection will experience a recurrence episode indicating the host often fails to develop natural immunity
following primary infection. Further, multiple vaccine trails have not met primary endpoint of reducing
occurrence of infection despite the vaccine candidates eliciting robust antibody responses against C. difficile
toxins, the primary virulence factors driving disease. A limited mechanistic understanding of why the
natural immune response to infection often does not promote immunity represents a critical roadblock
toward the goal of developing a vaccine that will elicit lasting protective immunity in high-risk
populations. This project will systematically evaluate the natural immune response to C. difficile infection
using both patient sample and a murine infection system. In aim 1 we will compare the capacity of the systemic
and intestinal mucosal antibodies elicited following infection to detect and bind to C difficile residing in the
intestinal lumen. Successful generation of an antibody response that targets C. difficile in the intestinal tract is
dependent on a coordinated C. difficile-specific CD4+ T and B cell response in the intestine and associated
draining lymph nodes and is the focus of studies proposed in aim 2. Last, in aim 3 we will investigate the in
vivo biogeography and transcriptome of C. difficile in the presence of adaptive immune pressure to identify
immune evasion mechanisms employed by C. difficile to promote persistence and transmission. The result of
all three aims will feedback into Project 1 (Vaccine Development) to inform mRNA vaccine studies by
providing a template how vaccine-induced immunity can be shaped to limit disease, prevent colonization, and
recurrence of C. difficile.

10857023,"Project Summary/Abstract
Disparities in kidney health is an important long-standing problem in the US. African Americans (AAs) who
represent 13% of U.S population, develop end stage kidney disease at 3.5-fold higher rates than European
Americans, explaining why 31% of people with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) are AAs. Two protein coding
mutations in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene are the causal drivers of 70% of this excess risk of ESKD in
AAs. Despite the urgent need for treatment of APOL1-associated kidney disease (AAKD), there have not been
any therapeutic trials specifically focused on AAKD. This need is compounded by severe underrepresentation
of AAs in clinical trials. Until these needs are met, disparities in kidney health in the US will persist. Our long-
term goal is to develop targeted therapies for the two most common forms of AAKD: APOL1-associated focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) in order
to mitigate the disparate burden of ESKD among AAs. The objective of this particular application is to target a
proximal pathway that drives APOL1-induced podocyte injury, which is a central mechanism of AAKD. Our
central hypothesis is that inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 kinases will block APOL1-induced podocyte injury, and
proteinuria, and thereby mitigate progression of AAKD to ESKD. This hypothesis has been formulated on the
basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratories. The rationale for the proposed research is
that discovery of an effective treatment for AAKD will reduce disparities in ESKD incidence, the high cost of
ESKD care, and the enormous loss of lives associated with ESKD—which is responsible for nearly as much
loss of life-years as breast cancer in women and more loss of life-years than colorectal cancer in men.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Build the
Durham Community APOL1 Program for community engagement and translational research; 2) Perform a pilot
phase II randomized clinical trial of a clinically available JAK1/2 inhibitor in patients with AAKD; and 3) Conduct
an ex vivo clinical trial “in-a-dish” using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived podocytes (iPods) of AA patients
with FSGS and HTN-CKD. Our approach is innovative because it leverages a creative community
engagement strategy to addresses the critical problem of underrepresentation of AAs in clinical trials while
simultaneously studying the efficacy and safety of an innovative treatment for AAKD. It also leverages our
innovative iPod platform as a tool for individualized therapy. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to serve as the basis for a future phase III trial of JAK1/2 inhibitor as therapy for AAKD. The impact of
therapy for AAKD includes reduction of the disparate burden of ESKD, mortality and financial cost associated
with AAKD, which are priorities of NIDDK. Additionally, because of its ability to predict patient’s future clinical
response to a drug, the iPod platform strives to advance personalized therapy of AAKD from theory to reality."
10851727,"Project Summary
 Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a degenerative disease that putatively arises from light chain
(LC) misfolding and aggregation. Full-length (FL) LCs are secreted from a clonally expanded plasma cell
population in AL. Thus, AL patients suffer from both a plasma cell cancer and a LC misfolding and
aggregation-associated proteinopathy that appears to compromise organ function, leading to progressive
organ deterioration. Currently, AL is treated by repurposed multiple myeloma drugs that kill the clonal plasma
cells secreting FL LCs. Mechanistically distinct therapeutic approaches are needed, particularly for patients
with cardiac involvement who cannot tolerate the currently available chemotherapy regimens. In this proposal,
we seek to produce lead candidates that ultimately would enable a clinical trial on a FL LC kinetic stabilizer
targeting the proteinopathy component of AL. In Specific Aim 1, we hypothesize that the LC kinetic stabilizers
to be synthesized in our hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry efforts can be dissected into four substructures—the
“anchor substructure”, the “aromatic core”, the “linker module” and the “terminal aromatic component”. This
hypothesis is based on 11 (FL LC)2•kinetic stabilizer crystal structures solved to date as well as the structure-
activity relationship data resulting from the synthesis of over 300 FL LC2 kinetic stabilizers during the past 18
months. We will continue to use structure-based design principles that we learned developing the drug
tafamidis, in addition to computational tools, especially the Schrödinger LiveDesign software, to replace the
metabolically unstable and potentially toxic coumarin aromatic core and the diethyl aniline anchor substructure
in our LC kinetic stabilizers, while introducing functionality to reduce albumin binding. The LiveDesign software
utilizes a weighted combination of the predicted LogP values and docking scores to accurately predict albumin
binding. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop FL LC2 plasma binding selectivity assays to validate our
computational efforts to diminish albumin binding. First, we will add fluorescently labeled FL amyloidogenic
LCs to pooled healthy donor plasma, along with proteinase K and a candidate kinetic stabilizer, and follow
proteinase K endoproteolysis linked to FL LC2 conformational excursions chromatographically over time. If the
kinetic stabilizer candidate selectively binds the amyloidogenic FL LC2 over all the other plasma proteins,
including albumin, FL LC2 proteinase K endoproteolysis will be prevented–this assay is largely developed.
Next, a subunit exchange assay will be developed to quantify pharmacologic FL LC2 kinetic stabilization in
human plasma. This assay also quantifies kinetic stabilizer binding to albumin. A fluorescently labeled
Cys214Ser FL LC2 variant facilitates subunit exchange experiments that afford the KD of kinetic stabilizer
binding to the FL LC2 variants added to healthy plasma, as well as the kinetic stabilizer KD for binding to
endogenous human albumin in plasma. These KDs will be used to generate binding selectivity ratios, i.e., KD of
kinetic stabilizer binding to albumin / KD of kinetic stabilizer binding to the FL LC2, which we will maximize."
10834081,"The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics."

The search for causal genetic variants associated with specific diseases among many variants identified by
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been rejuvenated several times by the increase in throughput,
resolution and the number/modality of experimental techniques that are broadly available. Advances in capturing
cell-type-specific physical proximity among genomic regions also added a new dimension for this search by
revealing the importance of 3D genome organization in interpreting the role of genetic variants in gene regulation.
A number of combinations of these different techniques have proven useful in identifying a number of causal
variants but many major challenges remain in our goal towards creating complete maps of genotype-phenotype
associations for complex diseases. Our recent focus has been to address an important gap in the current
knowledge of how genetic variants may impact 3D genome organization with or without a measurable impact on
gene expression of the cell state/type that is available for molecular characterization. We have identified a
number of genetic variants that associate with read coverage, strengths of specific loops and/or overall
connectivity of large genomic regions. Leveraging our expertise in computational analysis and the newly
established experimental component of our lab, we will address a number of questions emerging from our recent
findings within the next five years. We will first define and characterize the role of genetic variants, which we
found to be associated with specific chromatin loops and/or overall connectivity of regions harboring regulatory
elements in specific human immune cell types. Next, we will perform long read-based assays and develop
accompanying analysis methods to resolve allele-specificity and connection modality of multi-way interactions
involving regulatory elements. Throughout the project period, we will continue developing computational methods
for integrative, comparative and high-resolution analysis of conformation capture data. As we have done before,
our methods development will be in alignment with biological questions we are trying to answer but with flexibility
and generalizability in mind for their broad utility by other researchers."
10833599,"Much like their eukaryotic counterparts, numerous bacterial species use lipid-bounded organelles to
execute essential, and at times toxic, biochemical reactions in a compartmentalized fashion. Despite
their prevalence and importance to the health and survival of many organisms, relatively little is
understood regarding the formation, function, and diversity of bacterial organelles. To advance the
mechanistic study of lipid-bounded bacterial organelles, my group has developed two distinct model
systems: magnetosomes of magnetotactic bacteria and the ferrosome compartments of diverse
anaerobic microbes. Magnetosomes are lipid-bilayer invaginations of the cell membrane with a unique
protein content, within which nanometer-sized iron-based magnetic crystals are produced. Individual
magnetosomes are arranged into a chain with the help of an actin-like cytoskeleton, thus allowing
magnetotactic bacteria to use geomagnetic fields as a simple guide for low oxygen environments. The
cell biological features of magnetosomes make them ideal for understanding the evolution and molecular
basis of organelle biogenesis and biomineralization in bacteria. The magnetic and physical properties of
magnetosomes make them attractive targets for the development of biomedical applications including
their use as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, as drug delivery vehicles and as a medium
for hyperthermic killing of tumor cells. More recently, my group has discovered a novel iron-accumulating
lipid-bounded organelle named the ferrosome. Ferrosomes are formed through the action of a small
number of genes and are found in diverse bacteria including resident members of the gut microbiome
and opportunistic pathogens. The research program outlined in this proposal will leverage the expertise
and existing knowledge within my group to explore three general areas of magnetosome and ferrosome
biology. First, we will study the molecular components, biochemical activities, and cellular pathways that
define the cell biological characteristics of bacterial organelles. Our current focus is to understand the
mechanisms of membrane biogenesis, protein sorting, and subcellular arrangement for magnetosomes
and ferrosomes. Second, we are interested in the biochemical output and cellular function of
magnetosomes and ferrosomes. Using comprehensive genetic, chemical, and physiological assays we
aim to understand how these organelles are integrated into the essential functions of their host
organisms. Third, we look to exploit the natural diversity of magnetosome- and ferrosome-forming
organisms to understand the common and unique evolutionary paths of organelle formation in bacteria.
The combination of these approaches will shed light on the molecular blueprint and evolutionary diversity
of bacterial compartments. In the process, we hope to devise more rational paths for synthetic re-
engineering of magnetosomes and ferrosomes to deploy them more effectively in applied settings."
10834099,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by severe hypoxemia and pulmonary edema not
fully explained by cardiac dysfunction or fluid overload. This syndrome affects 45,000 children annually in the
United States; the mortality rate is 20% in the United States and 30% worldwide. Pediatric ARDS morbidity and
mortality are primarily mediated through cardiovascular dysfunction with subsequent organ failure rather than
lung injury itself. There are no specific pharmacologic therapies for adult or pediatric ARDS despite numerous
trials that have mainly targeted improving oxygenation. Pediatric ARDS pathophysiology itself and treatments
such as high positive end-expiratory pressure and permissive hypercapnia contribute to the development of
pulmonary vascular dysfunction (leading to pulmonary hypertension) and right ventricular systolic dysfunction
(RV dysfunction). Pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for RV dysfunction and RV dysfunction causes
impaired systemic cardiac output and, therefore, exacerbates multi-organ dysfunction. Thus, studies to define
the roles of pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction in ARDS outcomes are needed. Two-dimensional
speckle tracking echocardiography (or strain echo) is a sensitive indicator of RV dysfunction. Recent evidence
suggests that RV dysfunction (as measured by strain echo) and pulmonary hypertension are associated with
worse patient outcomes in pediatric ARDS. In addition, plasma-based biomarkers of RV dysfunction and
pulmonary endothelial injury may help to detect and predict these cardiovascular abnormalities. The proposed
study leverages existing infrastructure at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania
to conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study using serial echocardiography and plasma biomarker
assessments over the first week following pediatric ARDS onset. A diverse and experienced mentorship and
collaborative team, with expertise in translational and clinical research, has been assembled. They will provide
guidance for the candidate through a rigorous training plan involving research conduct, didactics in advanced
epidemiological analyses, training in echocardiographic methods, and intensive mentorship. The proposed
studies will define the clinical impact of RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension and investigate the role of
a novel biomarker of pulmonary endothelial damage in 250 patients with pediatric ARDS. Given the importance
of cardiovascular dysfunction in pediatric ARDS outcomes, cluster analyses will be used to classify patients
into cardiovascular subphenotypes that will be used in future studies for risk stratification and to test targeted
therapies to improve patient outcomes. Finally, the candidate will gain the necessary training in clinical
research, echocardiography, and biomarkers to mature into an independent clinician-scientist working to
improve outcomes for critically ill and injured children."

ongoing and successful postdoctoral clinical research training program on the human behavioral pharmacology
of substance abuse, for its 41st thru 45th years. Nine training positions are proposed, all at the postdoctoral
level. Training duration is two to three years. The goal is to produce experts in various aspects of substance
abuse, psychopharmacology, and treatment who go on to succeed as independent clinical researchers,
scientists, academicians, and administrators in drug abuse and related fields. The program has a long and
successful history, with many distinguished graduates. The program will provide training and experience in
translational experimental clinical trials research methods, extending from the human laboratory to the clinic.
Training consists primarily of conducting supervised clinical research in collaboration with training faculty and
analyzing and publishing the results, conclusions and implications of that research. Trainees attend and report
at major scientific meetings and participate in an organized program of educational seminars designed to
provide both breadth and depth to their knowledge and skills relevant to drug abuse and clinical research. The
training program site is a multifaceted drug abuse clinical research program -- the Behavioral Pharmacology
Research Unit -- plus other affiliated drug abuse treatment and research programs, primarily on the same
campus, but extending more broadly into the community as well. Research training is provided in the following
areas: clinical pharmacology of drugs of abuse; medications development research; the cognitive
neuroscience and behavioral toxicity of drugs of abuse; abuse liability assessment; pharmacological treatment
of drug abuse; behavioral treatment of drug abuse, especially incentive-based strategies; integration of
behavioral and pharmacological treatments; psychiatric and medical comorbidity; behavioral and
neuropsychiatric assessment; HIV risk behavior assessment; promotion of engagement and adherence; and

10898563,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
Cancer cachexia, or progressive weight loss featuring immunodysmetabolism, causes ~1/3 of cancer deaths.
Loss of muscle mass reduces performance status, predisposes to illness, and increases treatment toxicity while
reducing efficacy. Not merely a feature of end-stage cancer, cachexia is a disease with specific, targetable
mechanisms. Pre-clinical studies prove that targeting those mechanisms can preserve muscle and lengthen
survival, with or without chemotherapy. Cachexia is especially devastating in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), afflicting 85% of PDAC patients, most of whom present with weight loss. There is no effective treatment
for PDAC and 5-year survival is ~9%. Thus, until PDAC can be cured early in its course, we must manage
cachexia, because preserving muscle mass and function will promote response to cancer treatment, improve
quality of life, and increase survival. Overall, our Program team hypothesizes that PDAC tumor progression
and cachexia is highly orchestrated by an IL-6/IL6R/STAT3/NF-B signaling axis. Project 2 will test NF-B
in muscle inflammation and tumor progression, and Project 3 will study IL-6/STAT3/NF-B in tumor-stroma-
immune interactions and the macroenvironment. Project 1 of this Program focuses on the crosstalk between
adipose and skeletal muscle induced by PDAC tumors, and how IL6R, STAT3, and NF-B combine to produce
fat and muscle loss in the PDAC macroenvironment. Abundant data demonstrate that weight loss in PDAC is
primarily fat loss in PDAC. Moreover, we showed that fat loss is as predictive of mortality in PDAC as muscle
loss, regardless of response to therapy, suggesting a central role for adipose wasting in cachexia. Now we
demonstrate that tumor-induced, muscle-derived soluble IL6R appears to induce IL-6 mediated adipocyte
lipolysis, products of which feed forward to induce myosteatosis, lipotoxicity, dysmetabolism, weakness and
atrophy through a novel PKC-θ to PDK4 axis. Thus, we hypothesize that PDAC induces a feed-forward loop
among tumor, fat, and muscle whereby tumor-induced IL-6 and other signals activate adipose STAT3 and
lipolysis, products of which are taken up by muscle leading to myosteatosis, PKC-θ activation and subsequent
myofiber STAT3, NF-B and PDK4 activation, which promote dysmetabolism, local inflammation and production
of soluble IL6R to feed-forward activate adipose wasting. Blocking this cycle will preserve adipose and muscle
wasting in PDAC. Using genetic mouse models, human specimens, advanced single cell resolution sequencing
as well as correlative cachexia studies in a clinical trial, we will test our hypothesis in these specific aims:
AIM 1. Interrogate the mechanisms of adipose-to-muscle crosstalk in the macroenvironment of PDAC
cachexia.
AIM 2. Interrogate mechanisms of muscle-to-adipose crosstalk in the macroenvironment of PDAC
cachexia.
AIM 3. Interrogate manifestations and mechanisms of the IL-6/IL6R/STAT3/NF-B pathway in patients
 with PDAC cachexia."
10898567,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 2
Cachexia is a debilitating syndrome that results in severe, involuntary weight loss due to the depletion of skeletal
muscle and adipose tissues. This syndrome occurs in a majority of cancers and contributes to approximately a
third of all cancer deaths. Currently, no effective therapy exists to combat this malignant disorder. For pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most aggressive formof pancreatic cancer, the potential benefit for effective
cachexia therapies may be even greater than for other cachexia-associated malignancies, since 85% of these
patients lose on average 14% of their pre-illness weight, and cachexia dramatically limits their ability to tolerate
surgery, chemo- or radiotherapy. New therapies will likely evolve from an enhanced understanding of the
mechanisms leading to muscle wasting and tumor development (the primary driver of cachexia). This program
project brings together expert investigators in skeletal muscle, oncology, immunology, and cachexia, to explore
the role an NF-B/IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis within the macroenvironment of cancer cachexia – considering both
mechanisms of muscle loss and the development of PDAC. In Project 2 of this program, focus will be placed on
the NF-B portion of this signaling axis. Recent efforts have centered on two new concepts. The first is that
cancer cachexia associates with the activation of muscle stem cells initiating a repair pr ocess on the muscle
fiber. NF-B is activated in stem cells, and functions to block repair and promote muscle wasting through the
regulation of a local muscle inflammatory condition. The second discovery provides insight in how NF-B
functions within the tumor cell during development of PDAC. Using a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we
showed that NF-B plays a critical role in protecting tumor cells from the surveillance property of anti-tumor
macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. NF-B is able to suppress both innate and adaptive immunity through the
regulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine, GDF15. The goal of this project is to explore the hypothesis that
NF-B functions in the macroenvironment of cancer cachexia by acting in muscle stem cells to block muscle
repair, as well as promoting PDAC through the production of immunosuppressive genes such as GDF-15.
Towards this goal we seek to perform the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the relevance of NF-B
regulation of muscle inflammation in cancer cachexia; and 2) Determine how NF-B regulation of GDF-15 and
immune modulation promotes PDAC. Achieving this goal will enhance our understanding of the relevance of NF-
B and how this signaling component intersects with IL-6 and STAT3 to regulate muscle wasting and tumor
development within the macroenvironment of cancer cachexia."
10834138,"Project summary: This is a R01 renewal to develop functional intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging for
physiological assessment of retinal photoreceptors. Retinal photoreceptors are known as the primary target of
both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Early detection of eye diseases
and objective assessment of therapeutic outcomes are essential steps to prevent vision loss and blindness.
Structural only biomarkers cannot provide enough information for evaluating physiological condition of retinal
photoreceptors, and combined functional test is frequently required for disease detection and treatment
assessment. However, it is time-consuming and costly inefficient to conduct separate structural and functional
measurements. Functional IOS imaging, also termed as optoretinography (ORG) or optophysiology, is based on
near infrared (NIR) light mapping of stimulus-evoked physiological activities in the retina. Because IOS imaging
is based on dynamic processing of retinal images, it can naturally provide structural information offered in
traditional fundus photography. During the first grant period, we have demonstrated stimulus evoked IOS
response at the outer segment of retinal photoreceptors. The fast photoreceptor-IOS occurs immediately after
the onset of the retinal stimulation, differentiating itself from timely delayed IOS changes at the inner retina. The
fast photoreceptor-IOS provides a unique marker for objective ORG of photoreceptor physiology, without signal
contamination of post-photoreceptor layers. We propose here to characterize biophysical mechanism of the fast
photoreceptor-IOS (aim 1); and validate fast photoreceptor-IOS imaging for objective ORG of photoreceptor
function in human subjects (aim 2). The first aim is to use animal models to verify the correlation of the fast
photoreceptor-IOS to the activation phase of phototransduction. A custom-designed hybrid confocal-OCT
ophthalmoscope will be used for in vivo characterization of fast photoreceptor-IOS in WT and rd10 mice. In vitro
time-lapse light microscopy will be conducted to characterize transient outer segment response in individual
photoreceptors. Comparative electron microscopy of dark- and light-adapted retinal tissues will be implemented
to verify light-driven outer segment shrinkage at sub-disc level. The second aim is to verify the feasibility of
clinical translation of using fast photoreceptor-IOS imaging for in vivo ORG of human photoreceptors. We have
recently demonstrated virtually structured detection (VSD) based super-resolution imaging of individual rods and
cones in awake human. During this project, the VSD based super-resolution ophthalmoscopy will be refined to
achieve µm level spatial-resolution and ms level temporal-resolution for imaging fast photoreceptor-IOS changes
in human photoreceptors. Success of this study will pave the way towards pursuing clinical application of
objective ORG of retinal photoreceptors, enabling early disease diagnosis and prompt treatment assessment of
AMD, RP and other eye problems which can cause photoreceptor dysfunctions."

 Project SCORE
 Systemic inequities in access to healthcare and quality educational opportunity for the youth of
Mississippi (MS) are powerful forces that disengage students from entering pathways toward STEM careers.
Project SCORE (Student Centered Outcomes Research Experience) proposes to engage students from
groups underrepresented in STEM career trajectories through a youth participatory action research (YPAR)
approach, capturing and retaining their attention through the immediacy of health threats such as COVID-19.
Guided by a YPAR approach, Project SCORE will leverage a near-peer mentor model to engage and support
underrepresented students in an exploration of the field of public health. Project SCORE will bring together
underrepresented high school and graduate health sciences students from two communities with significant
health disparities in a year-long weekly afterschool program to develop relevant health behavior research
questions, provide training in research methods, and facilitate the development of student-conducted research
projects mentored by near-peer graduate health sciences students and faculty. A student-centered research
agenda will be developed to support future research initiatives. Students will complete their experience with a
week-long on campus immersion experience. This project seeks to increase awareness of and interest in
public health, science engagement, and STEM careers, as well as increase matriculation into higher education
STEM programs to enhance and diversify the future biomedical workforce."

Aortopathies, including aneurysms, dissection, and rupture, represent a key challenge in HLBS
research. In the past twenty years of our continuously funded research on aortopathies, we
have contributed to many mechanistic insights into the aortopathy research including a new
concept: There are regional characteristics of the aorta in regard to diverse embryonic origins
and functions of cells. The overall hypothesis of this R35 program is that heterogeneity of
cellular origins imparts functional variances along the length of the aorta, including diversity of
extracellular matrix stability, which in turn contributes to regional specificity of aortopathies.
Regional specificity of aortopathies is present in many mouse models that we have validated
and characterized. Our initial single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data have also implicated
new potential contributors to heterogeneity of the normal aortic biology and aortopathies. Three
major themes are proposed in this program: (1) What are the structural and molecular
mechanisms that contribute to biological and pathophysiological heterogeneity along the length
of the aorta? (2) Are cellular and extracellular heterogeneity a basis for regional specificity of
aortopathies? (3) How do signaling pathways, extracellular matrix, and crosstalk between
resident aortic cells coordinate to promote the heterogeneity of aortopathies? We have robust
tools including a spectrum of reagents, multiple classic and new mouse models,
ultrasonography, MRI, intravital microscopy, proteomics, and single cell RNA sequencing
techniques. In addition to aortopathy research, the PI has more than 30-year expertise in the
fields of lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, and atherosclerosis research. Aortopathies are
not a sole aortic disease, but is associated with a wide range of diseases or syndromes that
may affect skin, lung, kidney, brain, bone, and other organs. The proposed research program
will benefit from the flexibility to pursue potential contributions of other tissues and organs to
aortopathies, and vice versa the influences of aortopathies on other tissues and organs. This
R35 mechanism will also benefit the PI’s strength in basic research, enhance his interaction with
the translational research in the clinical arena, and train the next generation of scientists."
10881655,"AIMS: The goal of this application is to competitively renew Dr. Jian-Ying Wang's Senior Research
Career Scientist (SRCS) Award, and to continuously support Dr. Wang's VA research program.
NOMINEE: Dr. Wang has held a position of Senior Research Career Scientist from 2011, and he also holds
the title of Professor in the Departments of Surgery and Pathology at University of Maryland School of
Medicine (UMSOM) at Baltimore. Dr. Wang's research program has been continuously funded by VA-
MERIT Review Awards and multiple NIH-R01 grants for more than twenty-two years. Dr. Wang has had
many seminal research accomplishments throughout his career, and published more than 140 peer-
reviewed original research articles that have created more than 5,000 citations. In addition, Dr. Wang is a
major mentor/sponsor for VA Career Development Awards, and he also acts as a co-investigator in several
currently active VA-sponsored research projects.
RESEARCH: Studies in Dr. Wang's laboratory are to investigate the mechanisms underlying gut mucosal
regeneration and rapid epithelial restitution after acute injury; and to further search for new and more
effective therapies to maintain the intestinal epithelial integrity in patients with critical illness. Defective
regulation of early intestinal mucosal restitution and subsequent disruption of the gut epithelial integrity
occur commonly in various pathological states such as: stress/peptic ulcerations, Crohn's
disease/ulcerative colitis, post-massive surgery, trauma, and sepsis. Since the exact mechanisms
underlying gut mucosal continuous regeneration and rapid mucosal repairs after acute injury are still
obscure; effective therapies to preserve the gut epithelial integrity are limited, especially in patients with
critical surgical illnesses. Dr. Wang's research program is highly focused on the regulation of rapid gut
mucosal repair and homeostasis by Ribonucleic acid ( RNA)-binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding
RNAs (ncRNAs) in health and surgical diseases. His research program studies stress-related processes
regulated by RBPs and ncRNAs, the post-translational events that affect target gene expression in the
presence or absence of cellular polyamines, and the interplay between RBPs and ncRNAs under
physiological and pathological conditions. Dr. Wang's research employs the state-of-the-art techniques,
including approaches that examine specific messenger (m)RNA/ncRNA or mRNA/RBP interactions as well
as approaches focused on large-scale RNA analyses. His group has also extensively used gain-of-
function transgenic and tissue-specific knockout approaches to generate various genetically modified
animal models. Importantly, Dr. Wang's research projects are directly relevant to surgical patients with
mucosal injury/delayed healing, maladaptation, barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and sepsis. The
overarching goal of Dr. Wang's research program is to elucidate the post-transcriptional processes that
govern gut mucosal regeneration and rapid epithelial restitution, and to create a fundamental base for
development of new therapeutics for gut mucosal injury-related diseases.
IMPACT: Dr. Wang's research program directly addresses an important health issue relevant to the VA
mission, since gut mucosal injury-related diseases such as stress/peptic ulcerations, Crohn's
disease/ulcerative colitis, and gut barrier dysfunction occur commonly in our VA patient population. Dr.
Wang also actively collaborates with a number of investigators in the VA Maryland Health Care System
(VAMHCS) Research Service, and his expertise and academic activity help moving the VAMHCS research
program forward."

Zimbabwe
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This award will enable Dr. Sungano Mharakurwa to ascertain the epidemiological determinants
of urban malaria invasion in Zimbabwe in order to identify intervention targets for restoring
malaria-free status. The study will leverage on an existing national malaria vector surveillance
programme established at Africa University in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and Child
Care’s National Malaria Control Programme and its partners. This work will be undertaken with
guidance from an experienced team of mentors with strong complementary expertise in public
health, epidemiology, transmission biology, parasite genetics, genomics and human studies. Dr.
Mharakurwa will further his career development by; 1) conducting and directing the laboratory
assays, 2) undertaking short courses in molecular epidemiology, quantitative and sequence
data analysis, translation research, conduct of clinical trials and grant-writing; and 3) presenting
at international research conferences and writing publications. The program will be pivotal in
enabling Dr. Mharakurwa to establish a career and strong collaboration as an independent
malaria researcher in Zimbabwe. While Zimbabwe has made significant progress rolling back
malaria, a serious setback of reinvasion from endemic to erstwhile malaria-free areas of the
country, including highly populated cities, is emerging. The proposed research project will
employ molecular and field approaches to understand the seasonal distribution, determinants
and characteristics of parasites, vectors and humans associated with urban malaria invasion
into Mutare City of Zimbabwe in order to identify strategies for reclaiming zero transmission."
10832990,"Project Abstract
Periodontitis (PD) is a bone degenerative inflammatory disease that contributes to increased risk of other
diseases with more serious mortality and morbidity profiles. We propose here a novel immune therapeutic
strategy for PD, using cellular nano-particles, exosomes (EXO) from dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are the
“directors” of the adaptive immune response, as such, their immune functions can be exploited to treat chronic
immune-mediated diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. This is first study to our knowledge to
employ phenotypically stable exosomes from dendritic cells to treat experimental PD in mice. Our strategy
consists of “reprograming” immune cells in the periodontium responsible for destructive inflammatory bone loss
using custom DC exo. Our tactic is to inject DC exo directly into the gingiva, to target anti-inflammatory pathways
in specific immune cells, to prevent/resolve alveolar bone loss. The overall objective of these studies to acquire
a better understanding of the immunobiology of DC-derived exo in vivo and in vitro in the murine model of
experimental PD, and relate these findings to exo isolated from humans with PD. Our aims are to test the
hypotheses that: Aim 1. Exogenous DCexo delivered to the PD lesion persist in situ and reprogram recipient
DCs and T cells involved in experimental PD in mice in vivo; Aim 2. DC exo preserve molecular cargo and
reprogram acceptor DCs and T cells through receptor binding and endocytosis; Aim 3. Endogenous exo from
humans with PD contain molecular cargo of direct relevance to exo therapy and PD pathogenesis. Future goals
include: 1. the development of DC exo therapy for PD in humans, 2. assessment of salivary exo molecular cargo
for diagnostic potential in PD and other oral diseases"

10823362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 3
Atopic dermatitis (AD) often begins in the first year of life and is a precursor of allergic diseases. It is often
followed by food allergy (FA), with subsequent development of respiratory allergies. While the frequency of AD
and FA are increasing in industrialized countries, posing a large burden on healthcare, primary prevention
strategies are not yet successful. There is growing evidence that a farming lifestyle in early life in infants is
associated with a diverse microbiome and a reduced risk of atopy. We have recently shown that Old Order
Mennonites (OOM), a traditional single-family farming community, are significantly protected against early
childhood atopic disease (3.8% AD and 0% FA) as compared to a high-risk Rochester Children cohort (ROC),
born to atopic families, that show increased rates of AD (30%) and FA (15%). Consumption of unpasteurized
farm milk, exposure to farm animals, and greater microbial diversity were proposed to be associated with the
protective effects in OOM children. However, the protective mechanisms responsible for the attenuated
development of atopy in OOM children are unknown. Understanding these factors is key for development of
preventive strategies against AD and atopic conditions. Recent data suggest that epicutaneous allergen
sensitization occurs more readily through a disturbed skin barrier, as in AD. Further, development of FA is highly
associated with early, more severe AD, and skin colonization with S. aureus increases the risk to develop
FA. The effects of a farming lifestyle on promoting a healthy, homeostatic epidermal skin barrier, diverse
microbiome, and normal skin immunity, that prevent development of AD and allergic sensitization, have not
yet been evaluated. We hypothesize that lifestyle impacts the development of a healthy infant skin barrier,
immunity, and microbiome that may protect from allergic inflammation in the OOM infants or predispose towards
development of a perturbed skin barrier function and an aberrant skin immune millieu and microbiome that induce
AD and allergic sensitization in the ROC infants. We will test our hypothesis in a new longitudinal birth cohort of
high (ROC)- vs. low (OOM)-risk for development of atopy (n=80 in ROC and n=40 in OOM group), in which we
will collect lifestyle, environmental exposure, allergic sensitization, trans-epidermal-water loss/TEWL), skin tape
strips samples and skin swabs for microbiome, with the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: To determine
gene, protein, and microbiome skin biomarkers that modify the risk to develop AD or promote a healthy skin
barrier. Specific aim 2: To determine cutaneous biomarkers that promote or protect from development of FA
(and other atopic conditions), both with and without concomitant AD. Identification of the skin mechanisms,
including specific genes and pathways, and microbiome that predispose to allergic conditions, as compared to
those that may be associated with prevention of AD and atopy, can lead to novel prevention as well as
therapeutic strategies for AD and the atopic march. This project will have significant impact on public health."
10839312,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Foregut (esophageal, gastric, liver, biliary and pancreatic) cancers account for approximately 20% of new cancer deaths in
the United States each year, with an incidence that is projected to increase by almost 70% over the next ten years. These
are aggressive malignancies, with complex therapies that require coordinated, specialized multidisciplinary care. There are
significant racial and location-based disparities in the utilization of evidence-based guideline concordant therapy (GCT) in
foregut cancers. Race and location serve as proxies for multiple, potentially modifiable, barriers along the cancer care
continuum, that threaten access to and receipt of care. Identifying these barriers is critical to reduce disparities.
Accurate identification of patients at risk for non-GCT is a vital first step to intervene. However, there is no screening tool
to identify patients at risk for non-GCT. This project aims to address racial and location-based disparities in foregut
cancers by using mixed methods research to develop a risk prediction model and clinic-based screening tool that utilizes
modifiable barriers to identify patients at risk for non-receipt of GCT. Together, this clinically applicable and statistically
valid model and the high-yield screening instrument will inform an emerging model that identifies patients at risk for non-
receipt of care, and facilitates the administration of personalized, solution-focused interventions that can redirect the
course of care.
My long-term objective is to become an independent researcher focused on identifying, understanding and addressing
disparities in access to cancer care. This career development award will help achieve my objective by filling gaps in
knowledge and skills through a personalized training program that will include didactics, mini-sabbaticals, experiential
training and mentorship in three areas: (1) mixed methods with a focus on patient-oriented research (2) statistical
modeling and measure development and (3) implementation science. This training plan will support my proposed project
and enable my transition to an independent surgeon-scientist. The specific aims are (1) to identify barriers in access to
GCT in patients with foregut cancers through a patient-centric and stakeholder-informed approach (2) to examine the
extent to which modifiable barriers predict risk for non-GCT using quantitative modeling and (3) to develop and pilot test
a clinic-based screening tool to prospectively identify patients at risk for non-GCT.
This proposal is novel in its exploration of underlying modifiable barriers to inform the development of a model that
predicts receipt of inferior care, and a clinic-based screening tool to identifiy individuals at risk for disparities in access to
oncologic care. While there are currently a range of successful interventions such as patient navigation that have shown
promise in decreasing treatment disparities, there is no streamlined way for clinicians to identify patients at risk for non-
GCT. This proposal will allow for the identification of patients at risk for health disparities (non-GCT) in a consistent way
across providers and embedded in health systems.The results of this study will be used to apply for an R01 to
prospectively evaluate the utility of the developed screening tool in a multi-institution study to predict disparities in care
and test its invariance by race/ethnicity, location (rural versus urban), socioeconomic status and type of institution."
10873063,"PROJECT SUMMARY – LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION
Under University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) Director Howard Bailey, MD, a number of
critical steps were taken in the planning and evaluation process during the current grant period, which includes
the following: appointed additional External Advisory Board (EAB) members in informatics, COE, education, and
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI); completed 85% of prior strategic plan goals, which accelerated several
initiatives in biomarkers, imaging, program grants, and a dramatic increase in philanthropy (2017: $6M; 2021:
$17M); reimagined a bold future via a new strategic plan in partnership with health system leadership; conducted
ad hoc reviews of COE, and emerging cores, validating three new CCSG cores (CRIC, CBC, CAMP); and
facilitated bi-directional community input with a catchment expansion from 36 counties to Wisconsin’s entire 72
counties. Success in an organization provides an opportunity for leveraging achievements and forecasting a new
vision. UWCCC leadership embraced assessments of emerging scientific strengths, surveillance of the oncology
clinical care and research environment, and the eventual application of analysis-driven reorientation. This
occurred through regular and strategic planning meetings of individual focus groups/committees of the cancer
service Line; Executive Leadership Council; Senior Leadership Committee; Directors Committee; Ad Hoc
Advisors; EAB; and annual scientific retreats.
Our strategic planning process reorients UWCCC to leverage strengths and address challenges by expanding
key new Associate Director’s roles in genomics and precision medicine, community engagement, diversity,
equity, and inclusion, and a new senior medical director who will centralize the cancer service line. Dr. Bailey
promoted or externally recruited new Associate Directors in faculty development and education, clinical research,
and informatics. Leadership is accountable for creating an inclusive, respectful, and welcoming environment in
which all members, students, and staff will thrive. All UWCCC leadership roles further the center’s mission by
serving faculty members, employees, trainees, our patients, and our catchment area. Membership has grown
from 198 to 218. Over 11 new initiatives directly address professional growth of trainees and staff. Two new
community advocacy boards provided actionable advice, which led to a dramatic accrual rate increase for
patients with race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic White patients from 3.4% to 6.3% by 2021. We work
collectively to guide planning and evaluations, create a vision, set goals, assess progress, and set the agenda
for future directions. Leadership determines strategies to leverage the breadth and depth of science on the
University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. Meeting monthly, they identify and foster research capabilities that
will strengthen the UWCCC’s scientific programs and extend cancer focus into new areas."
10873067,"ABSTRACT – CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
The Clinical Research Central Office (CRCO) provides the centralized infrastructure for clinical research
activities at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC). The CRCO has 110 FTEs supporting
170 faculty PIs with an annual operating budget of $8.58M. The CCSG provides $311K annually (directs) of the
total budget. Under the leadership of Center Director Dr. Howard Bailey (CPC) and Associate Director for Clinical
Research, Dr. Kari Wisinski (DT), the CRCO has built upon the success of the prior efforts of expansion and
centralization of the CRCO to increase accrual to treatment intervention studies and reduce activation timelines.
The CRCO has central administration and services (fiscal, regulatory, informatics, compliance, education, etc.)
and Disease-Oriented Teams (DOTs) to lead study activation and coordination. In 2021, the CRCO supported
accrual of ~4,700 subjects to 538 research studies across the center. Of the 278 treatment intervention trials
open during 2021, the sponsor breakdown was: 11 Externally peer-reviewed (4%), 107 Industrial (38%), 53
Institutional (19%), and 107 National (38%). UWCCC achieved an increase in accrual to treatment intervention
studies from 319 in 2017 to 474 in 2021. Other key successes included expansion of a clinical trial navigation
team and establishment of the UWCCC-led statewide Precision Medicine Molecular Tumor Board (PMMTB).
These efforts facilitated high accrual of patients with catchment area priority cancers, rare tumors, and enrollment
to genomically-driven studies. A new protocol intake management system, study activation huddles, and a
dedicated activation team for NCI studies improved activation timelines by 23%. Staff turnover was stabilized
with remote work options, supported by enhanced technology, and an improved career advancement pathway.
The CRCO supports clinical research conducted on site, through multiple networks, including NCTN, ETCTN,
and statewide and national investigator-initiated trial (IIT) networks (e.g. Wisconsin Oncology Network, Big Ten
Cancer Research Consortium). Research informatics has expanded and CRCO leadership has optimized bi-
directional communication strategies with DOT leaders and staff. CRCO leadership is actively engaged with the
newly-established Oncology Service Council under Dr. Lee Wilke (TM), improving integration of research and
clinical care. The QA/Compliance team executes the UWCCC DSMP, enacting risk-based monitoring,
determined by study sponsorship and PRMC-adjudicated risk level. In collaboration with the UWCCC
Community Outreach and Engagement Office Cancer Health Disparities Initiative, the CRCO has multiple
new efforts to improve the accrual of underrepresented in medicine (URM) and rural individuals to clinical trials,
including increased translation services; targeted media outreach; and dedicated community navigator support
in DOTs. CRCO initiatives strive toward continued improvements in activation timelines, expanded access and
accrual to genomically-driven, theranostic, and immunotherapy studies, especially for URM, and increased
patient opportunities for tissue and data sharing in alignment with the UWCCC strategic plan."
10873074,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the UWCCC provides scientific oversight of clinical and
translational research conducted at UWCCC. This is achieved through the Protocol Review and Monitoring
Committee (PRMC), which is responsible for evaluating the scientific merit, resource allocation, trial priority, and
trial progress of new and ongoing cancer-related clinical and translational research protocols. Functions of the
PRMC are complementary to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), which focuses on the protection of human
subjects, and separate from those of the UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PRMC
ensures trials have appropriate data safety and monitoring plans in place; however, it does not perform data and
safety monitoring functions, which are the responsibility of the DSMC. The PRMC scientifically evaluates and
prioritizes UWCCC trials derived from and supported by institutional sources, including those originating from
other Cancer Centers or from industry. However, the PRMC does not duplicate traditional peer review, which
includes peer-reviewed protocols supported by the various NIH mechanisms, other approved funding agencies,
clinical research protocols supported by NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program or Cancer Control Protocol
Review Committee, and protocols that have received review from another NCI Cancer Center’s approved PRMS.
The PRMC has the authority to open protocols that meet the scientific merit and scientific priorities of the center
and to terminate protocols that do not demonstrate scientific progress.
The system for initial review is comprised of a 2-stage review process, starting first with the Disease Oriented
Team (DOT), followed by review by the PRMC. The 2-stage review process is used to increase efficiency by (1)
reducing staff effort in developing protocols and PRMC application materials of lesser scientific merit, (2)
reducing the timeframe from concept approval to protocol activation, and (3) decreasing the volume of protocols
reviewed by the committee, which enables faster and more thorough reviews. From 2017-2021, 1,741 protocols
entered the 2-stage PRMS, 900 protocols were approved by PRMC for activation, and 1,180 protocols were
monitored for progress and performance."
10873078,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) has been an integral component of the University of Wisconsin
Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) for the past 38 years. BSR personnel include doctoral and masters level
biostatisticians from the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (BMI), including six UWCCC
members, who devote dedicated effort to advancing the research goals of the UWCCC. The mission of BSR is
to enhance cancer research excellence by providing crucial biostatistics expertise through consultation and
collaboration with UWCCC members in research ranging from laboratory, to clinical, to population science.
Specific Aim 1. BSR will continue to engage in impactful scientific collaboration with UWCCC members and
thereby advance an interdisciplinary approach to cancer research. Specific Aim 2. BSR will ensure cost
effectiveness by matching BSR faculty and staff scientists to specific disease/research areas, standardizing
operations and data analysis tools, and capitalizing on the extensive expertise and computing infrastructure
available within BMI. To achieve these aims, BSR contributes to UWCCC research design, grant application
development, data analysis, and communication of results. BSR facilitates the selection of adequate study
subjects, assists in the identification of suitable study endpoints, provides data analysis plans and sample size
estimations/power calculations that align with study design, conducts and provides interim monitoring for studies,
analyzes results for presentation of research findings at scientific meetings, and prepares final technical reports
for scientific publication. BSR served 102 unique UWCCC program members across all six scientific programs
and contributed to 153 cancer relevant UWCCC program member publications over the 2017-2021 period. BSR
operates under a collaborative business model in which short term support to UWCCC members is funded by
the CCSG or other institutional funds and long term collaborations are funded by cancer focused grants and
contracts from the NCI, other NIH institutes, federal agencies, and private foundations, including multiple R01,
U01, P01, and P50 awards. This model of collaboration, instead of fee for service provided, has proven to be
highly effective and is strongly endorsed by the UWCCC leadership. BSR responds to the evolving needs of
UWCCC members by adding and aligning expert biostatistics faculty and staff statisticians/data analysts. BSR
advances the education mission of the UWCCC through direct consultative interactions with trainees engaged
in cancer research with center members, and by involving graduate students in our statistics and biomedical
data science graduate programs in collaborative cancer research projects. Collaboration of BSR faculty with
UWCCC members generates new ideas for statistical methodology research and thereby promotes statistical
theory and methodology development, completing the full cycle of collaboration and scientific interaction. BSR
has been and remains critical to the success of UWCCC’s mission to defeat cancer through rapid application of
groundbreaking research to reduce the cancer burden across Wisconsin and beyond."
10873082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mass spectrometry (MS) is the premier technology for detecting and quantifying metabolites, lipids, and proteins.
The mission of the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) Cancer Metabolomics and
Proteomics (CAMP) resource is to facilitate access to cutting-edge MS data to support UWCCC investigators’
research. CAMP is led by MS expert Dr. Josh Coon (GEM), Professor and Director of an NIH Biotechnology
Research Center for MS technology development (P41GM108538); it encompasses the vibrant UW-Madison
MS community that includes 11 faculty expert laboratories and four MS core facilities. This community houses
and operates over 50 MS systems capable of targeted metabolite analysis up to exotic protein post-translational
modification (PTM) discovery and quantification. Since 2017, this collective group contributed to 106 UWCCC
user publications. UWCCC members wishing to incorporate MS into their research initially meet with CAMP
leadership to discuss project background, goals, timelines, etc. The consultation meeting(s) aim to provide
guidance and advice on experimental design, e.g., for an upcoming grant submission, and enough understanding
for the CAMP leadership to assess and match the project to the appropriate CAMP Expert MS lab or core facility.
Note CAMP’s expert leaders are personally involved in educating and facilitating the MS technology needs of
UWCCC members, helping them successfully navigate a complicated technology terrain. CAMP uses a
collaborative model where MS projects are covered jointly by CAMP network labs and UWCCC members. For
example, when a UWCCC CAMP project is conducted with the NIH P41 Center led by Coon and Li (TM), the
MS cost is incurred by that mechanism. In cases where the UWCCC member project is a better fit for a CAMP
core laboratory, the UWCCC member must identify funds for that work; however, CAMP will assist the member
with technical review of funding proposals and similar support, as needed. Further, to kickstart small projects
(either collaborative or through MS cores) we have established a microgrant program. CAMP is a UWCCC-
specific resource that provides all UWCCC members a fast-tracked structure through which to get expedited
guidance and access to cutting-edge MS. Specific aims are to 1) disseminate and inform UWCCC members on
the capabilities and utility of state-of-the-art MS technologies for cancer research; 2) consult and guide UWCCC
members on design and implementation of MS-based cancer research; and 3) connect UWCCC members with
the appropriate MS expert laboratory to expedite MS-based research and discovery. Over 2017-2021 as a
developing core CAMP has had tremendous impact on UWCCC member research. Specifically, CAMP
collaborated with 22 UWCCC program members across five scientific programs, which resulted in 22 cancer-
relevant peer-reviewed publications. With the recent expansion of CAMP’s expert network, we anticipate even
greater impact. Collectively since 2017, CAMP Expert MS labs and core facilities contributed to 106 UWCCC
user publications."

Minimally invasive liquid biopsies have revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and emerged as
biomarkers for disease monitoring and drug development. The practice of longitudinal sampling of cancer-
derived material from blood, including Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has
been limited to a few commercial entities or academic laboratories with the requisite technological capacity. The
UWCCC Circulating Biomarker Core (CBC) was established in 2019, leveraging innovative technologies and
clinical research infrastructure, to expand access to these biospecimens and assays for UWCCC members, and
directly addresses UWCCC strategic plan A2.1. The CBC is structured to follow NCI guidance for biomarker
development focusing on assay robustness, feasibility, and impact for exploratory, integrated, and integral
biomarkers1. The CBC houses an expert research team and equipment to identify, organize, and process
samples from patients on clinical trials, both at UWCCC, across the catchment, and from national consortia.
Standard analytes purified range from plasma for ctDNA, cytokines, metabolites, and exosomes as well as
nucleated cells for CTC analysis and immune cell studies. The analyses performed include rare cell phenotyping,
gene expression profiling, and genetic analysis among others. The CBC coordinates with the Translational
Science Biocore (TSB) Biobank and clinical Biospecimen Disease-Oriented Team (DOT) weekly to ensure
efficient and timely processing of samples collected by these teams. In collaboration with the Wisconsin State
Lab of Hygiene, the CBC now provides a pipeline to move promising liquid biomarkers towards CLIA-certification
that can serve as an integral biomarker for clinical trials. One project, evaluating gene expression analysis of
prostate cancer CTCs (UH2CA260389; Journal of Clinical Oncology2), has entered this pipeline and is being
developed as an integral biomarker and clinical grade assay. The CBC provides researchers access to
innovative technology to develop new biomarkers as well as test these biomarkers in clinical trials using
established standard operating procedures (SOPs) for biospecimen processing and analysis. The CBC is led by
expert faculty leaders including CBC Director Dr. Joshua Lang, UWCCC TM program co-leader, and Dr. Jennifer
Schehr who has served as facility director for the CBC since its inception. Our Specific Aims are to 1) develop
exploratory liquid biopsy of biomarkers to advance our understanding of cancer and treatment resistance; 2)
perform clinical testing and translation of new liquid biopsy assays as integrated biomarkers, and 3) perform
analytical validation in preparation for clinical diagnostic laboratory implementation as integrated and integral
biomarkers. Over 2019-2021 as a developing core, CBC has had tremendous impact on UWCCC member
research. Specifically, CBC collaborated with 46 unique users, of which 67% were UWCCC members across
five scientific programs, which resulted in 6 peer-reviewed publications and 14 clinical trials. With the recent
expansion of CBC facilities and expert network, we anticipate even greater impact in the coming year."

research by providing members of the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) with cutting-
edge and efficient informatics, including bioinformatics, clinical informatics, image analysis, machine learning,
and computational science. CISR accomplishes this mission through a team of five highly skilled PhD staff
scientists, four world-renowned informatics faculty, and the substantial computational systems and support of
the University of Wisconsin Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics (BMI), within which CISR was
established in 2003. Specific Aim 1. Provide State-of-the-art Informatics Services. CISR provides deep and
broad expertise in bioinformatics and machine learning analysis of biological, clinical, and imaging data. CISR
staff are well versed in the latest computational approaches for a wide variety of tasks and can efficiently
implement and apply them to support UWCCC member projects. This support is provided through dedicated
effort of CISR staff to members’ funded projects; involvement of CISR staff in study design, pilot studies, and
grant application development; and development of standardized computational pipelines. Specific Aim 2.
Develop Innovative Informatics Methodology to Support Cancer Research. CISR staff develop novel
computational approaches and algorithms to allow UWCCC research to reach its full potential when existing
approaches are insufficient. Support for this aim is bolstered by the effort of four faculty members with expertise
in the development of novel algorithms in areas such as machine learning, electronic health record analysis,
causal discovery from observational data, natural language processing, deep learning, and RNA-Seq gene
expression data analysis. Faculty both collaborate with and mentor the PhD scientists in the development of
novel computational approaches and their application to members’ research. During the current Cancer Center
Support Grant (CCSG) cycle, support for this aim was enhanced with the growth of the staff from three to five
scientists, further increasing capacity and expanding the expertise of CISR to include immunological signaling,
genome annotation, transcriptional regulatory networks, and epigenetics. During this cycle, CISR supported 61
individual UWCCC members across all six scientific programs and usage doubled over the prior cycle, in terms
of the average number of members served per year. With UWCCC investigators, CISR staff co-authored 34
cancer-related articles, contributed to the submission of 30 grant applications, and supported grants totaling
$14M in direct costs, including five from the NCI and four from other NIH institutes. CISR has had important roles
in several large-scale UWCCC projects, including the Head and Neck Cancer SPORE (P50DE026787) and a
P01 for targeted radionuclide therapy (P01CA250972). CCSG funding of CISR will ensure that its team will
continue to be well positioned to meet the evolving computational research needs of UWCCC investigators for
cutting-edge cancer research, which is increasingly reliant on massive and heterogeneous data sets."

Since its inception in 1988, the Flow Cytometry Laboratory (FLOW) has served as the only comprehensive
shared resource on the UW-Madison campus for multiparameter flow cytometry, cell sorting and imaging cell
cytometry. The mission of FLOW is to operate a cutting-edge facility that provides UWCCC researchers the
infrastructure, technical expertise, and educational support required for fluorescence-based single cell analysis
and isolation that advances basic, translational, and clinical research. FLOW manages one 67-parameter Cytek
Aurora, five 16-parameter ThermoFisher Attune, one 20-parameter BD LSRII, and one 20-parameter BD LSR
Fortessa analytical cytometers; three BD FACSAria and one Sony MA900 cell sorters; and a Luminex
ImageStreamX MarkII imaging cytometer. Strong institutional support and funds from NIH S10 Shared
Instrumentation Grants have allowed FLOW to purchase and maintain state-of-the-art instruments, computers,
and software needed for data acquisition and analysis. FLOW operates facilities at two locations: 1) our main
laboratory in the Wisconsin Institute for Medical Research (WIMR), which is located on West Campus and
houses the majority of UWCCC researchers; and 2) a satellite facility in the UW Biotechnology Center (UWBC),
which is located on Central Campus near our remaining members and contiguous to facilities that provide DNA,
RNA, and single-cell next-generation sequencing to characterize freshly sorted single cells and cell populations.
FLOW partners with the Department of Pediatrics and the UWCCC Small Animal Imaging and Radiotherapy
Facility (SAIRF) to operate cytometers dedicated primarily to studies of pediatric cancers and analysis of
radioactive samples, respectively. The latter partnership was established to support targeted radionuclide
therapy of pediatric tumors in combination with immunotherapy. Dr. Manish Patankar (TM), a UWCCC member
and ovarian cancer researcher, serves as faculty leader. Ms. Dagna Sheerar has managed day-to-day
operations since 2011. Ms. Sheerar and her 6 staff members possess over 80 years of collective experience in
cytometry. The specific aims for FLOW are to: 1) evaluate new technologies and develop business plans to
procure and maintain new instruments allowing users access to cutting-edge approaches to single cell analytics
and sorting; 2) provide expert consultation and education services for single cell analytics and cell sorting ; and
3) organize user groups and develop data analysis support in collaboration with the Cancer Informatics Shared
Resource for the increasingly complex data sets generated by multi-parameter cytometers and sorters. During
the current CCSG funding cycle, FLOW served 109 unique UWCCC program members across all six programs
who collectively hold/held 445 cancer relevant research grants, including 118 awards from the NCI, and
contributed to 169 cancer relevant UWCCC member publications. Survey data indicate a high level of user
satisfaction and project increasing demand for services offered by FLOW."
10873108,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Genetically engineered animals and cell lines are widely used as models to define the mechanisms underlying
cancer etiology and progression and to evaluate strategies for cancer treatment and prevention. The Genome
Editing and Animal Models Shared Resource (GEAM) has served as a shared resource for the University of
Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) for over three decades and is one of the elite facilities in the United
States to offer the comprehensive services required to generate, characterize, and preserve genome edited
animal models. GEAM’s mission is to make state-of-the-art genome editing technologies for animals and cell
lines as well as cryopreservation services accessible to UWCCC members. Specific Aim 1 is to generate
novel, highly relevant, genome edited or transgenic animal models of human cancers. GEAM staff serve
UWCCC members in all aspects of experiment planning, including the design of efficient approaches to achieve
the desired genome manipulation using CRISPR, homologous recombination, and transgene-based
approaches; the identification of animals that carry the desired genome edit or transgene; and the minimization
of off target edits. Our extensive experience in reproductive biology, embryo manipulation, and animal husbandry
enable GEAM to edit the genomes of mouse and rat strains that exhibit low reproductive capacity. Specific Aim
2 is to develop clonally derived, genome edited, cell lines for use in cancer research. In the current cycle,
GEAM established a pipeline that is capable of editing the genome of a wide variety of established cell lines and
implemented a state-of-the-art automated clone tracking system. Specific Aim 3 is to provide state-of-the-art
reproductive biology services that enable animal model banking, recovery, and sharing. GEAM’s sperm
and embryo cryopreservation capabilities reduce animal husbandry costs and allow recovery of cancer models
through embryo transfer or in vitro fertilization. Rederivation of rodent models eliminates pathogens that may
compromise research or prevent animal model importation into campus vivaria or sharing between collaborators.
In the current cycle, GEAM has continued to modernize our infrastructure through purchases of new equipment
using institutional support, adopted the latest and most advanced genome editing methods, and added highly
trained staff to best meet the increasing and technically challenging needs of our users. Thirty-nine unique
UWCCC program members were served by GEAM during the current Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG)
funding cycle. Support from the CCSG enables GEAM’s services to be tailored to the unique needs of UWCCC
members and provided at costs below those of commercial vendors or similar cores at other research
universities. GEAM’s first rate, cost effective, services enhance the ability of UWCCC investigators to conduct
innovative research and advance the strategic mission of the Center. Data from biennial surveys of UWCCC
members indicate GEAM’s services are high quality and critical to our members’ research."
10875390,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Noncoding regulatory mutations had driven human evolution since the split from chimpanzees and more than
90% of disease-associated loci reside in noncoding regions. Because gene regulation is dynamic and context
dependent, functions of noncoding regulatory mutations should be defined in specific cell types and at particular
developmental stages. However, such a fine-resolution mapping of noncoding mutations in human diseases and
evolution has been lacking in the literature, and this proposal aims to develop a comprehensive research program
to close the knowledge gap by pushing our genome analysis to a single-cell resolution.
 My recent work has developed innovative approaches for disease genome analysis and has identified key
elements driving recent human evolution. Given the prime importance of the noncoding genome in human
diseases and evolution, the long-term goal of my research is to identify causal noncoding mutations that affect
human phenotypes by perturbing gene regulation. Built on our recent success in capturing pathogenic noncoding
somatic mutations that are predictive of prostate tumor characteristics, in the next five years, my research will
push our genome analysis to a single-cell resolution. By developing a series of machine learning frameworks,
we will be able to directly determine the allelic effects on altering cell-type-specific epigenomic architecture,
revealing the cellular contribution to human diseases or to any evolutionary traits. Towards this goal, my
laboratory is actively generating single-cell epigenome data, have obtained access to large-scale genomes for
different disease categories, and have developed an innovative deep learning model achieving substantially
enhanced precision for capturing pathogenic noncoding mutations.
 To demonstrate the general applicability of our research framework, we will investigate rare germline
mutations in prostate cancer, common variants in preterm birth, and the Neanderthal introgressed alleles in the
modern human genome for their regulatory effects on affecting human brain development. These conditions
have wide population prevalence, and our preliminary analyses have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of
our machine learning model on identifying consequential noncoding mutations in specific cell types. We will also
build an open-access genome browser which will allow users to visualize and analyze regulatory effects of any
mutations in a given cell type. Overall, the proposed program will uncover new disease mechanisms from the
noncoding genome, will reveal the Neanderthal impact on brain development of modern humans, and will provide
a generally applicable tool for genome analysis at a single-cell resolution. Different from conventional
approaches, this proposed research by introducing single-cell analysis will directly reveal the most affected cell
populations in diseases, thereby guiding the future development of therapeutic strategies targeting the affected
cell types."
10813730,"Translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases (Pols) promote replication through DNA lesions. Biochemical,
structural, and genetic studies have indicated that TLS Pols play highly specialized roles in replicating through
DNA lesions. Although there is a great deal of information on the structure and function of TLS Pols, and on the
multiplicity of pathways that mediate predominantly error-free TLS and which utilize the action of one TLS Pol or
the sequential action of two Pols, there is no information on how these TLS processes are regulated. Based
upon the evidence we provide here, we propose a role for ATR kinase in normal human cells in (a) promoting
predominantly error-free TLS via multiple pathways; (b) promoting TLS in conjunction with the replisome stalled
and stabilized at DNA lesion sites; and (c) in coordinating TLS by the sequential action of two Pols in which one
Pol inserts a nucleotide opposite the DNA lesion and another Pol extends synthesis therefrom. In Aim 1, we will
carry out studies to establish that unlike in ATR proficient cells where TLS operates via multiple, predominantly
error-free pathways, TLS in ATR deficient cells operates via a single highly error-prone pathway. In Aim 2, to
establish that ATR promotes proficient TLS dependent replication through DNA lesions in conjunction with the
replisome at replication forks (RFs) stalled at DNA lesion sites, we will analyze the ways in which TLS in ATR
deficient cells differs from that in ATR proficient cells. For these studies, we will: (a) determine the extent by
which RF progression through UV lesions is inhibited in ATR deficient cells compared to that in ATR proficient
cells; (b) determine that whereas TLS operates in conjunction with replisome in ATR proficient cells, the
replisome disassembles in ATR deficient cells; subsequently, TLS occurs in gaps, requires PrimPol for initiating
DNA synthesis, and CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase for PCNA ubiquitination; (c) determine whether accumulation of
Pol at cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) occurs with slower kinetics and at reduced levels in ATR deficient
cells compared to that in ATR proficient cells; and (d) determine whether RF collapse resulting from replisome
disassembly at DNA lesion sites in ATR deficient cells confers a large elevation in chromosomal aberrations and
apoptotic cell death. In Aim 3, we will analyze the role of ATR mediated phosphorylation of TLS Pols in the
formation of a TLS Pol ensemble so that the two different steps of TLS dependent upon two Pols occur in one
physical entity, rather than independently.
The evidence that in contrast to ATR proficient cells, TLS dependent replication through DNA lesions in ATR
deficient cells operates in highly mutagenic ways, occurs in gaps, is conducted differently and much less
efficiently, and that chromosomal instability and apoptotic cell death are highly elevated in the absence of ATR,
will be important for establishing that by restraining DNA damage induced mutagenesis, chromosomal instability,
and apoptotic cells death, ATR’s role in TLS would contribute to genome stability and cellular homeostasis."
10867286,"Project Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect tens of millions of people around the world and
represent a staggering challenge for patients, families, and healthcare systems. For some who present with
mild levels of cognitive impairment, there is rapid worsening of cognition and function, whereas for others, the
rate of progression can be absent or much slower. Understanding this variability in rate of progression is
critically important to patients, families, and clinical researchers alike, and is not well-predicted by common,
clinically available biomarker tools. Blood-based markers of AD pathology and neurodegeneration have
potential for widespread use in clinical research and even clinical care, due to their non-invasiveness, cost
relative to neuroimaging, and lack of medical contraindications to limit their use. Here we examine a set of
newly developed, blood-based AD biomarkers (including neurofilament light chain, phospho-tau species, tau,
and Ab fragments) that may fill this gap. Leveraging prospectively acquired samples from a large clinic
population and from local clinical research studies, we will determine how these plasma measures relate to
variable rates of ""real-world"" cognitive and functional decline, as well as to imaging-based measures of
neurodegeneration and AD pathologic progression."

The mission of the “Physical Genomics Predoctoral Training Program” (PGTP) is to train the next generation of
transdisciplinary scientists that will bridge molecular biology, bioengineering, physics, optics, chemistry, and
medicine. Through collaboration of program faculty in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied
Sciences, the Feinberg School of Medicine and the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, the PGTP aims to
enable trainees to acquire and apply a broad skillset that addresses the physical manipulation of living systems
in the pursuit of new strategies for the treatment of disease.
Physical genomics is a new field that involves understanding the structure, function, and fundamental principles
of chromatin, an intricately folded group of macromolecules including DNA, RNA, and proteins that houses
genetic information within cells and determines which genes get suppressed or expressed. With this
understanding, researchers can reversibly regulate, control, and even reprogram global patterns of gene
expression without altering the genes themselves. This has wide implications in the treatment of diseases such
as cancer and Alzheimer’s and other potential applications such as improving crop yields and mitigating the
impact of climate change on plants and coral reefs.
The PGTP will deploy a range of strategies to help trainees integrate practical, hands-on experience with the
knowledge base required to advance research in physical genomics. Through an evidence-based approach to
training, trainees will participate in experiential learning and seminars focused on reprogramming chromatin to
treat disease and engineer living systems to overcome environmental challenges using breakthrough optical
imaging, computational genomics, and molecular biology. The trainees will be mentored by faculty with an
outstanding record of productivity and mentorship. Program mentors will provide ongoing review, evaluation, and
mentoring of trainees with the goal of creating a resilient, diverse cadre of scientific professionals.
The ability to regulate the physical structure of chromatin represents a new frontier in biological discovery and
has the potential to be one of the major drivers of 21st-century biotechnology. The PGTP aims to position its
trainees as the next generation of interdisciplinary biomedical leaders able to explore this frontier through an
exceptional training experience in physical genomics."

10834149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute and critical care is a time-sensitive medical specialty where providers leverage biomedical technologies
to save severely ill and injured patients and restore their functioning after a life-threatening accident or sudden
medical emergency. Acute and critical conditions account for ~40% of hospital costs, highlighting the ongoing
need for new biomedical innovations that can help providers make rapid clinical decisions, diagnose, monitor,
and treat critically ill and injured patients. However, the complex and urgent nature of acute and critical care
presents distinct technical and engineering challenges that most engineers are not currently trained to address.
The goal of this new Acute and Critical Care Engineering (ACCE) Training Program is to equip Engineering
doctoral students to collaboratively develop, test, and commercialize medical innovations that fulfill the unique
design and engineering requirements of acute and critical care technologies. This program will provide trainees
with a foundation in key engineering principles and techniques; understanding of the clinical and technological
issues in acute and critical care; and rigorous research and commercialization skills to translate rapid, precise,
easy-to-use, point-of-care tools to the patient bedside. We will enroll 2 pre-doctoral Engineering students each
year (typically in their second year of graduate education), and each trainee will complete ACCE over 2 years.
This interdisciplinary program will be jointly housed in the College of Engineering and the Weil Institute for
Critical Care Research and Innovation, bringing together engineering, medical, and other disciplines.
ACCE Program objectives are: 1) provide coordinated interdisciplinary research mentorship from a primary
mentor in the College of Engineering and at least one secondary mentor in the Medical School; 2) provide
tailored curriculum tracks based on trainees’ technological focus (either health IT, diagnostic/monitoring tools,
or therapeutic devices), with each track comprising engineering, design, and biomedical coursework relevant to
the technology area; 3) provide valuable insights into the unique clinical setting and technological needs within
acute and critical care through our ACCE Clinical Immersion Program; 4) provide targeted training in the
unique design requirements of acute and critical care technologies via a bi-monthly ACCE Design Studio; 5)
provide coursework, guidance and workshops in product development and commercialization as well as
optional biomedical industry internships to ensure trainees understand major principles of biomedical
translation; 6) provide opportunities for interdisciplinary networking and feedback through other ACCE events
(Journal Club, Annual Symposium); and 7) provide career development and leadership curriculum
emphasizing responsible conduct of research, rigor and reproducibility, collaboration, oral and written
communication, and grant writing skills. Due to the unique opportunities, skills, and knowledge provided by the
ACCE Program, we expect graduates will be highly sought after for academic and industry research positions."
10810680,"The goal of this proposal is to renew a highly successful pre- and post-doctoral training program in the area of
development and neuroadaptations in alcohol and addictions (DNA2). Given increasing recognition that alcohol
use disorder and other addictions have roots established in early development, the proposed training grant will
provide the next generation of researchers with crucial training in the conceptual issues and methodological
approaches for studying developmental neuroadaptations leading to substance use and use disorder. Building
on existing research strengths in this area, exemplified by the Developmental Exposure Alcohol Research
Center (DEARC), and anchored by historically strong graduate training programs in development, addictions
and neuroadaptations within the Department of Psychology, the DNA2 program will provide a rich, cooperative
intellectual environment conducive for highly successful research training, didactic education and mentorship
for the proposed predoctoral (4/year) and postdoctoral (2/year) trainees. The training program emphasizes five
key goals: (1) to actively seek and recruit a highly qualified and diverse group of pre- and post-doctoral
trainees whose interest in and commitment to research in alcohol and addictions fits the laboratory(s) of one or
more mentor-eligible faculty and to provide each with an individualized training experience that fosters
expertise in state-of-the-art assessments, hypothesis formation, rigorous experimental design, data acquisition
and analysis, and oral presentation and publication of results; (2) to create a formal training program that
emphasizes breadth in conceptual knowledge and technical capabilities and fosters translational
considerations; (3) to emphasize critical thinking, scientific rigor and best practices for scientists of the 21st
century; and (4) to support the career/professional development of each trainee. To meet these goals, the T32
program will provide comprehensive interdisciplinary training through didactic coursework, trainee workshops,
seminars/colloquia, journal and writing clubs, supervised research experiences, and participation in
professional meetings and extra-university training opportunities. Methodological issues and techniques in
alcohol and drug addiction research will be emphasized throughout the typical 2-year training period for each
trainee, with a particular focus on training in developmental approaches, and rigorous attention to education in
the responsible conduct of research, including means to enhance research reproducibility. This training
program combines the expertise of faculty with established expertise in the alcohol field, as well as in research
with other addictive drugs, to capitalize on synergies across research programs and perspectives."

prior to their second year. A required grants course in the second year ensures students think deeply about
their project from the onset. The resulting grant proposals form the basis of the oral qualifying exam which
must be completed by the beginning of year 3. Students who submit the proposals have a high success rate in
gaining individual funding through F31 and similar mechanisms. To enrich the training experience, the GPTP
uses a validated, milestone assessment tool along with the individual development plan and an annual
reflection meeting to create a student-centric, tailored and flexible training plan for each student. The custom
training plans leverages the broad assortment of career development sessions afforded to students at Emory,
and encourages an internship. These plans are augmented by informal mentoring with both peer and informal
faculty mentors. The program is led by a Program Director and Steering Committee with deep expertise and
commitment to graduate education. There are 48 training faculty, each of whom must complete training in
mentoring as well as diversity, equity and inclusion in order to train a GPTP appointee. Students apply and
matriculate in the affiliated GMB graduate program through a review process that evaluates each applicant's
research experience, personal statement, academics, letters of recommendation, trajectory, and potential for
community contribution. The program size provides the intellectual community to support interdisciplinary work
and expose trainees to a breadth of cutting-edge genetics and genomics research. Five students per year will
be appointed to the GPTP at the beginning of year 2, reappointed in year 3 and will remain affiliated with the
program until graduation through annual reflection and planning, customized training activities and peer
mentoring. The current time to degree is 6 years, which while on par with the national average, is likely to be
reduced under the GPTP. The GPTP will institute a robust evaluation plan enabling optimization of program
training activities. By ensuring an inclusive, rigorous, student-centric training environment with clear
expectations, the GPTP will empower students to be creative, independent thinkers as they enter the nation's
biomedical workforce."
10900562,"Electrophysiology is a critical technology in neuroscience as a direct measure of neuronal functions. It has become routine for scientists to record and stimulate neuron populations in different brain regions in awake behaving animals, correlating activity with behavior. However, it has been insurmountable for the same electrophysiology to perform well in the spinal cord of behaving animals. For this reason, while the spinal cord is a critical site for locomotion and sensations, it remains largely a “black box” from a functional perspective, due to the lack of tools to measure and modulate spinal neurons while they are functioning. The main difficulty of doing electrophysiology in the spinal cord of behaving animals is because the cord is extremely mobile, moving and bending during behavior. Almost all existing neural electrodes, being mechanically more rigid than spinal tissues, fail to follow such movements, therefore yielding excessive noise and position drifts and lead to spinal injury or scaring in the long term. Here, we propose a suite of technologies centering around ultraflexible electrodes to address this challenge for the community. We now have preliminary data proving these probes achieved high quality single unit recording from spinal neurons of behaving mice. Markedly, when the animals are actively moving in diverse behaviors, we were still able to stably track neuron populations through spike sorting. Our preliminary long-term results also verified chronic in vivo recording for over 5 months after implantation in the spinal cord. Motivated by this success, we propose research plans to optimize this technology for spinal cord studies. Critically, we have brought together a group of outstanding neuroscientists to work with us in developing surgical approaches, and testing devices across different spinal areas, animal models, and research topics. These efforts are organized into three aims. We expect this new technology will enable new perspectives on the function of individual spinal cells in the context of a wide spectrum of behaviors that the spinal cord mediates (different speeds of locomotion, stopping, reflex withdrawal, reaching, grasping, urination, etc.). This will allow neuroscientists to connect the well-developed genetic and developmental characterization of spinal cell types to the circuit; to understand how other parts of the nervous system interact with the spinal cord. From a translational perspective, this offers the opportunity for a better understanding of the etiology and progression of spinal cord injury and disease by chronic monitoring; opens up the potential for intra-spinal interfaces that treat spinal cord injury, stroke, movement disorders, and motor neuron diseases."

 Sensory signals encountered under different circumstances may have quite different implications. In the
early olfactory system, preliminary evidence suggests that this (non-olfactory) contextual information is
integrated into odor representations at a very early stage, potentially even the main olfactory bulb. Recent
evidence indicates that the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), a structure directly adjoining the olfactory bulb,
serves to integrate afferent odor information with contextual information from the ventral hippocampus
(vHC) and is necessary to solve contextually-dependent olfactory decision-making tasks.
 The vHC is known to relay task-relevant spatial contextual information to other brain systems. We here
hypothesize that direct projections from the vHC to the AON play a dominant role in the integration of
contextual and olfactory information, and that the AON embeds this multisensory contextual information into
early-stage odor representations. Our preliminary data show that rodents can learn to respond differently to
odors based on the spatial context in which they are encountered, and that the expression of such a rule
depends on both AON and vHC, whereas a similar but odor-independent task requires vHC but not AON.
We propose a multipronged approach to understanding the integration of spatial context into olfactory
representations, engaging electrophysiological ensemble recordings and interareal coherence
measurements in awake, behaving rodents, the optogenetic manipulation of vHC and AON circuit activities,
and a double-labeling strategy for the within-subjects comparison of immediate-early gene (Fos) responses
across two experimental conditions separated in time."

Our research proposes to elucidate local and systemic immune dysregulation in rosacea with the long-term goals
of developing novel preventative and therapeutic targets and improving overall health outcomes for rosacea
patients. Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease with unclear etiology affecting over 14 million people
in the United States alone.1 Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a microbe-sensing mechanism that maintains immune
homeostasis in the skin through communication with commensal microbes.2-4 Therefore, we suspect that
understanding the skin microbiota-host interaction is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of rosacea. Moreover,
the immune dysregulation in rosacea does not appear to be localized to the skin. There is a growing body of
epidemiological evidence demonstrating that rosacea is associated with a wide range of systemic co-
morbidities.40-51 Thus, it is also important to elucidate potential systemic immune dysregulation that can explain
the overall disease burden in rosacea patients. Aim 1: We aim to test the hypothesis that skin dysbiosis induces
transcription and expression of the components of the innate immune response implicated in the pathogenesis
of rosacea. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data integration of the microbiome, transcriptome, and
proteome from rosacea skin in order to delineate the microbiota-host interaction. Aim 2: We aim to test the
hypothesis that there is shared immune dysregulation between the skin and systemic circulation that can explain
the burden of systemic co-morbidities in rosacea patients. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data
integration of the transcriptome and proteome from the skin and blood/serum in order to characterize shared
molecular pathways. Dr. McGee’s career goal is to become a physician scientist with the unique expertise to
apply multi-omics, data-driven, personalized strategies to treat inflammatory skin diseases and their associated
systemic co-morbidities. To achieve this goal, she will undertake a combination of formalized coursework,
workshops, and hands-on training in bioinformatics, computational biology, human subjects research, and
clinical trials. She will also engage in career development activities by participating in a grant writing course and
a K-R transition program. Dr. McGee’s research and career development will be guided by a mentoring team
with several decades of combined experience in successfully transitioning their mentees to research
independence. Dr. McGee’s training will take place at two prominent academic institutions: 1) Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School which supports ~250 principal
investigators and offers 16 institutional and 12 departmental core facilities, and 2) Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, which hosts the consistently ranked #1 biostatistics program in the country and supports
computational research initiatives to answer multidisciplinary questions."
10909811,"Many drug candidates fail in clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or insufficient safety. We
speculate that our poor success rate at predicting in vivo drug efficacy stems from a reliance on
in vitro assessments of drug activity that are performed at constant drug concentration (under
equilibrium conditions), when in fact drug concentration is not constant in the human body. We
thus propose that the kinetics of drug-target complex formation and breakdown is a critical factor
in modulating drug action. In this proposal we will elucidate the molecular factors that dictate the
impact of drug-target residence time on in vivo drug activity. These studies will focus on inhibitors
of three antibacterial targets: UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylase
(LpxC), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS). We will quantify
the role that intracellular events such as target (re)synthesis, target degradation and target
vulnerability have on the correlation between drug-target residence time and antibacterial activity
determined as a function of drug concentration. This includes the prolongation of antibacterial
activity following removal of drug from the system (the post-antibiotic effect). We will develop
structure-kinetics relationships for time-dependent enzyme inhibition using a combination of
structural and computational biology coupled with enzyme kinetics and synthesize inhibitors with
extended target engagement. A mathematical model will be used that links drug-target kinetics
and drug pharmacokinetics with predictions of antibacterial activity in whole cells and animal
models of infection. Improved ability to predict in vivo drug action from in vitro parameters will
have a dramatic impact on the discovery of new therapeutic agents."
10844369,"Despite progress in the treatment of primary tumors, metastatic disease remains incurable. While all metastatic
sites are important clinically, skeletal metastases are common in patients with breast, prostate, lung cancer,
and other, with approximately 70% of women that die from metastatic breast cancer experiencing serious
complications from bone metastases. Once established in the bone, tumors disrupt normal bone homeostasis
leading to increased pain, fracture, and general morbidity. Our previous work has established the transcription
factor Gli2 as a promising target for reducing tumor induced bone disease. After identifying the small molecule
inhibitor, Gli Antagonist 58 (GANT58), as a promising inhibitor of Gli2 activity in bone metastatic tumors, we
discovered the poor bioavailability of GANT58 limited its use in systemic delivery models. Thus, we developed
polymeric NPs to solubilize, improve the pharmacokinetics (PK), and promote bioavailability of GANT58
(GANT58-NPs). The NPs comprised reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive poly(propylene sulfide-block-
oligoethylene glycol acrylate) (PPS-b-POEGA). Intravenous injection of the 1st generation GANT58-NPs
(Dh=93 nm) reduced TIBD in models of intratibial and intracardiac breast tumor cell inoculation and in a lung
cancer model (3 unique models). GANT58-NPs were safe (did not elevate serum markers of liver/kidney
toxicity or cause detectable histopathology. Our 2nd generation NPs were bone targeted (BT-GANT58-NPs),
and the chemistry utilized enabled tuning of the density of the bone binding ligand, alendronate (ALN), a
bioactive bisphosphonate (osteoclast inhibitor). While both formulations reduced tumor invasion into bone and
reduced tumor proliferation by ki67 staining, they did not eliminate tumor and did not significantly reduce tumor
bulk in models of established bone metastatic disease. Here, we propose to screen a broader polymer
chemistry space focusing on: (1) Developing an alternative bone targeting strategy without inherent bioactivity;
(2) Studying how NP core chemistry affects GANT58 loading, GANT58 triggerable release, and consequent in
vivo PK; (3) Defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities, and dose dependent PK /
PD. In addition, we will evaluate the efficacy of a co-loaded GANT58 and paclitaxel BT-NP formulation. Each of
these formulations will be evaluated for detailed PK/PD and biodistribution properties to identify promising
formulations to reduce tumor induced bone disease without inducing systemic toxicity. Our preliminary data
show promising results that include low toxicity and efficacy in reducing tumor burden in bone and bone
destruction. This proposal will explore the efficacy and PK/PD properties in more detail to develop a promising
therapy for eventual translation. The results of these studies will help identify a novel and promising strategy to
reduce tumor burden and bone destruction in patients with bone metastatic disease. Due to the current lack of
effective therapies for these patients, the results of these studies could impact patient outcomes and lead to
exciting new therapies for patients with bone metastatic tumors."
10792898,"SUMMARY - PROJECT 2 (ANTIGEN DISCOVERY)
Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming pathogen that causes a wide range of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders
varying in severity from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis and death. Difficulties in treating infections with
conventional antibiotics and increasing rates of recurrent infection underscore the need for the development of
new therapeutic strategies to combat this urgent public health threat. To date vaccines for C. difficile have not
fully met this need, thus future strategies will require innovative approaches that limit disease and promote
clearance of this pathogen. Our objective is to generate a pipeline to identify novel vaccine antigens on the C.
difficile cell and spore surface and develop these as the next generation of multi-valent mRNA vaccines against
C. difficile. Antigen discovery strategy will incorporate aspects of the C. difficile life cycle, antigen variation on
the cell surface, and microbial ecology. We hypothesize that detailed characterization of C. difficile proteins and
gene systems important for fitness in the infected gut and competition with the resident microbiota will lead to
validation of highly effective new vaccine targets. Our approach will use whole genome sequence (WGS) and
surface proteome analyses on a wide array of hospital and community-associated strains and in-depth
investigation into metabolic correlates during infection. We will combine advanced imaging mass spectrometry
(IMS), mouse models of infection, and genetics to define nutritional requirements for C. difficile during infection
and target these surface exposed proteins for mRNA-LNP vaccination. Together, this work will generate a
translational workflow that leverages microbial ecology for discovery of novel vaccine targets for eradication of
C. difficile."

The overall, long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanism of that define the cochlear
amplifier in outer hair Cells (OHC). Specifically, we will focus on the voltage-driven motor Prestin, a unique
member of the SCL26 family of transporters found in the basolateral membranes of OHCs. Although Prestin
has been studied extensively though functional approaches, the basic mechanistic understanding of this
fundamental component of the cochlear amplifier remain to be solved. In spite of the richness of the existing
functional data, the lack of a high resolution structure is a key missing element in defining its mechanism at a
molecular level. This is particularly so for the two fundamental aspects of Prestin’s mechanism of action: the
process underlying voltage sensing and the molecular mechanism of electromotility. In light of exciting new
preliminary data at the core of this proposal we will be able to study the functional behavior, high resolution
structure and dynamics of Prestin as a biological piezoelectric device. To do so, we plan to experimentally
address several fundamental questions: What is the physical basis of the energy transduction steps, starting
with transmembrane voltage changes and culminating in protein (and ultimately OHC) motion? What are the
structures of the key functional states in its native, bilayer-embedded form? Where in the molecule does
mechanical transduction occur? And how? What are the physical basis of the Prestin-bilayer interaction?
Functional studies will be designed to understand the physical basis of energy transduction. Information on the
high resolution structure of functionally relevant conformations, conformational dynamics and energetic
relationship of Prestin with its surrounding lipid bilayer will be obtained from cryo-EM, electrophysiology and
Fluorescence microscopy experiments. The data will be interpreted to generate high resolution structures of
the different stages of the electromechanical transduction. We suggest that the advent of new cryo-EM
approaches to the analysis of structure and dynamics in membrane proteins in their native lipidic environment
shall open an exciting new experimental avenue. This information will impact our understanding of
physiologically important events such as hearing, high frequency amplification and signal transduction."
10839477,"ABSTRACT
Legionella pneumophila is an infectious bacterium that causes Legionnaire’s disease and remains a major cause
of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised individuals such as the elderly and cancer patients.
Macrophages are the main immune cells that can clear Legionella after activation of the canonical Nlrc4/Naip5
inflammasome. Caspase-11 is a component of the non-canonical inflammasome and mice lacking caspase-11
allow significant Legionella replication in their macrophages. Down-regulation of the homologous caspase in
human macrophages increases their permissiveness to Legionella. Our preliminary data show that caspase-11
is necessary for fusion of the Legionella-containing vacuole with the lysosomes via a mechanism that requires
the polymerization and depolymerization of actin. Using state-of-the-art techniques including 3D confocal
microscopy and high resolution SIM-S microscopy, RNA seq and proteomics analyses, we identified new
molecules that are cleaved by caspase-11 and regulate restriction of Legionella in macrophages. This proposal
will investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to caspase-11-mediated clearing of Legionella infection."
10837069,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lysosomes are the primary catabolic site of cells, serving to degrade extracellular material internalized by en-
docytosis and intracellular components earmarked for turnover. These items and the hydrolytic enzymes that
degrade them are delivered to lysosomes by multiple membrane trafficking pathways, which are operated by
cellular protein machineries that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man. Mutations that disrupt the ac-
tivities of these machineries are linked to genetic diseases, and pathogens exploit these trafficking pathways to
establish infection. Many of the molecular mechanisms that operate membrane trafficking machineries are un-
known. My lab addresses fundamental questions about membrane trafficking to lysosomes using the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a genetically tractable model organism. The major questions we plan to
address over the next five years include the following. 1) What are the physiological mechanisms that regulate
the trafficking of cell-surface receptors to the hydrolytic interior of the lysosome? This trafficking pathway func-
tions at endosomes to sort endocytosed receptors into membrane-enclosed transport vesicles that are deliv-
ered into the lysosome lumen. Recent progress from my lab has revealed that the formation of these vesicles
is coordinated with other processes that are vital to cellular physiology, including ubiquitin protein homeostasis
and endocytic pH regulation. We plan to identify the machineries that interface these different cellular systems
and determine how they exert control over the protein machinery that mediates the formation of vesicles trans-
ported to the lysosome lumen. These results will define ways in which receptor degradation is coordinated with
cellular physiology. 2) What are the mechanisms that mediate the delivery of newly synthesized transmem-
brane proteins that are destined to function at the lysosomal membrane? Using novel genetic tools we created
for discovery and diagnostics, we recently identified two specific cellular machineries and several additional
candidate machineries that function in this trafficking pathway. We plan to define the mechanisms by which
these machineries function in transport, which will establish fundamental principles that underly the biogenesis
of lysosomes. Our work is bolstered by ongoing productive collaborations that employ diverse interdisciplinary
techniques, including high-resolution microscopy, biophysical analyses of protein assemblies reconstituted in
vitro, proteomics, and genetic screening. Moving forward, our overall vision is to continue exploiting yeast for
discovering and mechanistically understanding membrane trafficking to lysosomes while also addressing the
extent to which these mechanisms are conserved in human cells. The information gained from this work will
provide an understanding of how membrane trafficking pathways to lysosomes operate under normal physio-
logical conditions and how they are vulnerable in disease states."
10816490,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
Glycans and proteins interact on the cell membrane affecting the general characteristics and behavior of the
cell. The nature of glycan-protein interactions is of fundamental interests to biology, however elucidating this
interaction in live cells has been strictly limited. Crosslinking technology has advanced and has been used to
understand the fundamental of protein-protein interactions. These methods employ many new crosslinking
reagents and have further been aided by the significant progress in rapid throughput proteomic methods.
While most membrane proteins are glycosylated, glycan-protein crosslinking experiments are rare and limited
by the dearth of glycan specific crosslinking reagents as well as limitations in glycomic and glycoproteomic
analytical methods. This research will develop glycan-protein crosslinking reagents for use in live cells. It
further takes advantage of bioorthogonal reagents that allows the incorporation of modified monosaccharides
into the cell's metabolic pathway producing chemically modified glycans in cell membrane. The incorporation
and efficiencies of the syntheses and crosslinking reactions are monitored by new glycomic and glycoproteomic
analytical methods. The modified glycans are used to tether crosslinking reagents that react with target
proteins. The method identifies the glycopeptide as well as the crosslink target protein providing
unprecedented views of the role of glycans in protein-protein interactions.

10838547,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During brain development, neurons must properly differentiate into distinct subtypes to assemble healthy
circuits. Thus, disruption of this process can impact neural architecture and wiring, and contribute to disorders
such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. The hippocampus is a brain structure crucial for learning and
memory, and its function is compromised in these disorders. Excitatory pyramidal cells in area CA1 provide a
major output of hippocampal computations to other brain regions. These cells can be parsed based on their
physical position within CA1 as “deep” or “superficial.” Deep and superficial hippocampal pyramidal cells are
distinct classes of neurons that exhibit differential molecular signatures, electrophysiological properties,
sources of afferent input, and circuit connectivity with local inhibitory interneurons. Determining the
mechanisms underlying their differentiation is crucial for understanding hippocampal development and function
in both health and disease. Superficial pyramidal cells in CA1 preferentially express the transcriptional
regulator Satb2, which controls gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. In humans, mutations of
Satb2 cause developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autistic behaviors. Our preliminary data
show that knocking out Satb2 during early development in mice disrupts the differentiation of superficial
pyramidal cells in CA1. Furthermore, there are non-cell-autonomous changes to the migration and survival of
distinct subtypes of interneurons in mutant mice relative to controls. In the present proposal, three specific
aims will test the hypothesis that early expression of Satb2 is necessary for hippocampal pyramidal cell
differentiation and circuit development in CA1, while later expression is necessary to promote experience-
dependent synaptic plasticity. These experiments will use molecular genetic tools in mice to conditionally
knock out Satb2 from pyramidal cells during both early and late developmental stages. Aim 1 will use
electrophysiology and electrical stimulation to study the strength and plasticity of different sources of afferent
input to deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells in acute slices. This aim will test the hypothesis that early
Satb2 expression is necessary to establish differences in afferent input strength, while later expression is
necessary for activity-driven synaptic plasticity of these inputs. Aim 2 will use paired whole-cell recordings
between pyramidal cells (deep and superficial) and identified subtypes of interneurons to map circuits and
study details of their synaptic physiology. This aim will test the hypothesis that early Satb2 expression is
necessary to establish circuit motifs between local inhibitory interneurons and superficial pyramidal cells, while
later expression is necessary to recruit new inhibitory synapses in response to environmental enrichment. Aim
3 will use single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to determine how Satb2 knockout alters gene expression and
chromatin accessibility in CA1 at multiple developmental timepoints. This aim will provide molecular insight into
how Satb2 controls gene expression in CA1 through development, and how its function may change over time."

10834887,"The goals of the proposed research are to elucidate mechanisms of genome organization during neuronal
activity in vivo and determine the roles of these mechanisms in learning and memory. We recently discovered
that the sensory experience of animals controls the remodeling of neuronal genome architecture in the brain.
The rapid induction of local genomic interactions between gene regulatory enhancers and promoters drives the
upregulation of activity-dependent gene expression to promote motor learning. However, hundreds of genes are
downregulated with neuronal activity in vivo, a finding that has been observed in multiple brain areas with
unknown mechanisms and functions. This raises fundamental questions of what are the mechanisms that control
activity-dependent transcriptional repression and what are the functions of these large genetic programs in motor
learning. In this grant proposal, we will interrogate potential molecular mechanisms and biological functions of
3D genome organization at multiple scales in the control of gene repression.
 First, we will determine if neuronal activity might trigger sequence-specific transcription factors to remodel
local genome architecture including between gene regulatory enhancers and promoters. Based on our findings,
we will test the hypothesis that regulation of brain-enriched transcription factors triggers the breaking of
enhancer-promoter interactions in the presence of neuronal activity to repress gene transcription. Furthermore,
we will also test the hypothesis that local genome architecture maintained by these transcription factors play a
critical role for motor learning in mice. These experiments will shed light on molecular mechanisms that
dynamically regulate local genome architecture in the brain.
 Second, we will determine if remodeling of long-range genomic interactions including interactions
between different chromosomes might regulate activity-dependent gene repression. Based on our preliminary
findings, we will test the hypotheses that 1) in unstimulated neurons, genes form inter-chromosomal interactions
with specific nuclear bodies involved in active transcription and 2) weakening of gene interactions with these
nuclear bodies during neuronal activity attenuates gene expression. In addition, we will also test the hypothesis
that these nuclear bodies found in adult neurons play specific roles in the acquisition or expression of motor
memories in mice. These experiments will illuminate the roles of brain-enriched nuclear bodies in transcription
and long-term memory.
 The proposed research will potentially advance our understanding of genome organization principles at
both local and long-range genomic scales in the control of neural circuit refinement and adaptive changes in
organismal behavior. Because mutations of genome architectural proteins and synaptic proteins are linked to
disorders of cognition in humans, our research will also provide an integrated view on how sensory experiences
orchestrate processes from the cell nucleus to the synapse to ensure a plastic and healthy brain."

Complex phenotypes are suites of adaptive traits that contribute to a shared function. An
important challenge is understanding how such phenotypes evolve and are maintained in
populations. Theory predicts that the evolution of complex traits and their preservation in the
face of homogenizing gene flow will depend on the genetic architecture of trait divergence, the
types and sources of genetic variation, and the presence of reproductive isolating barriers.
However, we lack empirical systems to rigorously test these theoretical expectations. While
investigations into the genetic basis of repeated phenotypic evolution in emerging model taxa
provide an opportunity whether, and how often, evolution proceeds through similar genetic
processes, studies of repeated evolution have often involved comparison of only two or three
lineages, and rarely have studied complex traits. My research group will bridge these gaps by
investigating evolutionary genetics of floral pollination syndrome, a complex adaptation, in the
plant genus Penstemon. In this genus, a novel syndrome phenotype has evolved at least 20
independent times. My group will initiate research directions aimed at systematically quantifying
genetic and genomic features governing the evolution and maintenance of complex trait
diversity, leveraging the exceptional parallelism in Penstemon. We will examine the genetic and
genomic architecture of adaptive divergence using replicate QTL analyses, determine which
elements of complex traits display genetic parallelism, assess whether standing variation or
gene flow act as a source of genetic variation, and examine how complex trait variation is
maintained in recently diverged species using population genomic data. This integrative work
will contribute to the development of a general framework for understanding whether, and
through what mechanisms, phenotypic evolution is constrained by genetic mechanisms. In other
words, such data will illuminate the inherent flexibility and limits of an organism's genome to
adapt to novel environmental challenges."

Asymmetric cell division (ACD) plays a critical role in fate specification and morphogenesis during development.
This process is also crucial for tissue homeostasis and repair in adulthood. Dys-regulation of ACD results in
developmental/intellectual disabilities and tumorigenesis, making it critical to understand the underlying cellular
and molecular mechanisms.
 A critical aspect of ACD is the establishment of cell polarity. Studies in invertebrate systems have
identified important cortical polarity regulators, which ensure proper segregation of fate determinants into two
daughter cells. These studies further shed light on how distinct protein complexes establish and maintain their
reciprocal cortical polarity. Despite these advances, how cortically localized proteins polarize non-cortically
distributed cell fate determinants is not well understood. Research into vertebrate systems has begun to uncover
new insights into the function of these evolutionarily conserved polarity regulators. Radial glia progenitors
(RGPs), the principal vertebrate neural stem cells (NSCs), represent a model cell type as they predominantly
undergo ACD during active neurogenesis to balance self-renewal and differentiation. Our prior work shows that
in embryonic zebrafish forebrain RGPs, the key cortical polarity regulator Par-3 is critical to establish asymmetric
Notch signaling activity in daughter cells. It remains unknown how Par-3 establishes such asymmetry.
 Recently, we uncover, for the first time to our knowledge, that Par-3 is present in the cytosol and
associates with the dynein motor complex on Notch ligand-containing endosomes. Together, Par-3 and dynein
are required in the mother RGP to directionally transport Notch ligand-containing endosomes to the self-
renewing daughter. Additionally, we discover that cortical Par-3 domain shifts from apical at interphase toward
posterior during mitosis, to align with cell division orientation along the anteroposterior embryonic axis.
 In this application, we wish to build upon these new findings to address the following questions: 1) how
does Par-3 work together with dynein to direct polarized dynamics of Notch ligand-containing endosomes? 2)
what is the dynamic relationship between cortical and cytoplasmic Par-3? 3) What mechanisms reconstruct the
axis of Par-3 polarity from apicobasal during interphase to anterior-posterior during mitosis? Our central
hypothesis is that both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms operate to reshape Par-3 cortical polarity; this cortical
polarity then sets up a polarized cytoplasmic gradient of Par-3, which in turn directly facilitates endosome
dynamics by activating dynein.
 The proposed work is expected to yield significant new insights into asymmetric division and neural stem
cell fate regulation during vertebrate brain development. These findings should have a positive impact on
revealing fundamental principles and laying groundwork for elucidating disease etiology and stimulating new
therapeutic development."

Abstract: Genetics Core
Understanding the genetic basis of CM is a major goal of these projects. Since obtaining DNA from patients and
generating large amounts of sequence data will require extensive computational, bioinformatic and statistical
analyses, we have established a Genetics Core to serve these critical needs. In addition, this Core will provide
a major data-storage and data-sharing function for both this PPG and for investigators worldwide. This Core will
have three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will focus on performing all the NGS and analysis for this PPG. The Core
personnel will work closely with Project investigators in the design of proposed experiments, and will provide
standard analysis for each project. Critical to this application, the Genetics Core personnel will also provide data
interpretation and additional follow-up data-driven iterative analyses as are often required. This will permit major
increase in efficiency by having computational biologists dedicated to this PPG; will offer an iterative approach
since analysis of NGS data is complex and experiment driven and will provide consistency regarding analytic
approaches. We will guarantee data storage, management and transfer of genetic data. All relevant genomic
results (those found to be predictive of CM or CM-related traits) will be transferred to a database maintained by
the Clinical core, where they will be incorporated with phenotype/outcome data to generate a user-friendly
interface that enables the simultaneous queries by PPG investigators of phenotype sequence variants, as well
as other genes involved in CM. Lastly we will be focused on providing local and public data sharing. We will
ensure that raw and analyzed sequencing data are submitted to stable repositories that are accepted by the
research community and in accordance with NIH Data Sharing policy. Therefore, a major goal of the Genetics
Core will be to expand public access to the generated genomic data by interactive public web tools. Within the
last year of the PPG we will generate a public web site with a user-friendly interface that enables queries on
genetic and phenotypic datasets simultaneously. Ultimately the Genetics core represents a central conduit for
genomic and bioinformatics flow of data of this PPG therefore contributing significantly to further understanding
the genetics basis of CM."

 effective CM scientists."
10768730,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for veterans and in the world, for both men and women in
industrialized countries, accounting for an estimated 28% of all cancer deaths in the United States. Non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents the majority of these cancers,, and NSCLC has a 5-year survival rate of
~23% with current treatment options palliative. Hence, new therapeutic strategies are needed to impact this
disease, and elucidation of new mechanisms controlling the tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells will provide the
foundation upon which to build. In this regard, the gene, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), that
encodes the tumor suppressors, p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), is found inactivated or deleted in NSCLC at a high
percentage (e.g., ~53% deletion rate). Importantly, our laboratory linked CDKN2A inactivation to dysregulation
of the RNA splicing of an uncharacterized, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located on Chromosome 19p13.12
(ENSG00000267053). Specifically, exon 3 inclusion/exclusion into the mature RNA transcript was
dysregulated in NSCLC cell lines with CDKN2A mutated/deleted, and thus, we now term this lncRNA, Cyclin
Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A-regulated lncRNA 1 (CyKILR-1). Initial cell signaling studies using small
molecule inhibitors also identified the AKT/CDK4 axis as a regulatory pathway upstream of CyKILR-1 RNA
splicing linked to CDKN2A inactivation. In human NSCLC, CyKILR-1 splice variant expression correlated with
lower patient survival. These findings are congruent with studies showing the linkage of the aberrant
expression of non-coding RNAs located at Chromosome 19p13.12 to cancer development. In preliminary
studies, specific downregulation of CyKILR-1 splice variants in NSCLC cells induced dramatic decreases in cell
survival and anchorage-independent growth. Initial mechanistic studies examining CyKILR-1 Exon 3 revealed
a consensus sequence for nuclear localization (TCTAGCTCAGCCC). Fractionation experiments then
demonstrated differential localization between the two splice variants with CyKILR-1B (exon 3 excluded)
localized to the cytoplasm in contrast to the nuclear localization of CyKILR-1A (exon 3 included). The
culmination of these data forms the hypothesis that inactivation of the tumor suppressor encoding gene,
CDKN2A, in NSCLC regulates the inclusion of exon 3 producing the CyKILR-1 splice variants, which localize to
the cytoplasm and imparts pro-survival phenotypes to NSCLC cells and tumors. To examine this hypothesis in
depth, we propose in this application the following independent, but synergistic specific aims (SAs): SA1: To
determine the biological relevance of CyKILR-1 RNA splicing in NSCLC; SA2: To determine the regulating
mechanism of CyKILR-1 RNA splicing; and SA3: To determine the cell signaling pathways regulated by
CyKILR-1 splice variants. These specific aims are focused on scientific lines of investigation to address the
need for new and precise therapies for treating NSCLC, which when combined with newer therapies (e.g., PD-
L1/PD-1 interaction blockers; IMFINZI/durvalumab) may produce more durable results and a longer 5 yr
survival. For example, the validation of our hypothesis in Aim 1 (i.e., CyKILR-1 splice variants regulate NSCLC
cell survival) will show that targeting the this novel lncRNA mechanism is a promising approach to compromise
lung cancer development and tumor maintenance for those tumors presenting with a CDKN2A inactivation
mutation or deletion. With RNA-based therapies showing efficacy in clinical trials, these mechanisms become
enticing targets for new therapeutics with the added benefit of being tailored to specific oncogenotypes. Aims 2
and 3 synergize with Aim 1 by determining the cellular mechanisms regulating both CyKILR-1 RNA splicing
and the downstream signaling pathways modulated by CyKILR-1 splice variants. These findings will then be
related back to Aim 1 in regard to specific tumor biological phenotypes, which would allow clinicians to use
specific targeted therapies."
10827496,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Disorders of keratinization (DOK) are severe, rare genetic skin disorders in which the central
barrier function of the skin is disrupted and a compensatory pathway of hyper-proliferation is
activated in either a localized area or throughout the entire skin surface. This results in a grossly
compromised epidermis that fails to adequately protect against bacterial, chemical, and
mechanical assault or to prevent transepidermal water loss. In early life, the consequences of
these disorders can be life-threatening, with increased susceptibility to infection due to blistering
and fissures, dramatically increased metabolic demands due to evaporative heat loss and
increased epidermal turnover rate, and various associated comorbid conditions and systemic
abnormalities which can persist throughout life. We and others have identified over 70 diverse
genes for these disorders, yet clinical experience and our data show that these genes explain
only a portion of heritability for DOK, which demonstrate marked locus and phenotypic
heterogeneity, with greater than 15% of subjects without mutation in known genes. In the last
funding period, we identified five new genes for DOK, provided evidence for phenotypic
expansion in two others, and identified a novel pathogenesis-directed therapy for one disorder.
We now propose to expand our large cohort of well-phenotyped DOK kindreds, to screen for
mutations in known causative genes, and to employ exome and genome sequencing in those
subjects without mutation in known DOK genes to discover novel genetic causes of these
disorders. We will employ patient-derived cells and tissue to interrogate the function of
identified novel genes, and will generate transgenic skin equivalents to study and prove
pathogenesis of identified mutations. For a limited number of novel genes not previously
implicated in DOK, we will generate mouse models using CRISPR technology to further
examine the effect of identified mutations on cutaneous function. These studies will continue to
identify molecular pathways central to the complex processes of epidermal differentiation and
self-renewal, and will provide critical context for more detailed future biologic studies."
10913617,"Project Abstract
The pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in ART era is complex and may result
from low levels of HIV-1 replication/HIV-1 proteins, ART drugs, drug of abuse, and the misuse of stimulants
such as methamphetamine. It is envisioned that combined exposure of these HIV-related factors leads to
reversible synaptodendritic impairment that contribute to the development of HAND. Growing evidence
indicates the existence of sex differences in both HAND and in methamphetamine misuse; Women living with
HIV have greater neurocognitive impairments, and methamphetamine misuse leads to more severe gray
matter damage and cognitive deficits in female. One factor for these sex-differences is estradiol (E2), a major
form of estrogen with two isoforms (17β-E2 and 17α-E2). Although both isoforms are neuroprotective,17α-E2,
the predominant estrogen in the brain, may play an important role in HAND. Significantly, our findings indicate
that endolysosomes represent as critical sites, where 17α-E2, HIV proteins (gp120 and Tat), ART drugs, and
methamphetamine could intersect to affect synaptodendritic impairment and sex-differences in HAND.
Endolysosomes are important for important in modulating neuronal plasticity because their extensive
processes require constant vesicular membrane trafficking to maintain axonal and somatodendritic
membranes. Endolysosome dysfunction resulting from combined exposure of HIV-related factors could lead to
synaptodendritic impairment. Conversely, the endolysosome enhancing effect of 17α-E2 could reverse
synaptodendritic impairment and contribute to sex-differences in HAND. The objective here is to investigate the
role of endolysosomes in synaptodendritic impairment and sex-differences in HAND. We will test the
hypothesis that endolysosome localization of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is critical for the protective effects of
17α-E2 against endolysosome dysfunction and synaptodendritic impairments resulting from combined
exposure of HIV-related factors (gp120, Tat, ART drugs, and methamphetamine). Guided by our preliminary
findings, our novel hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims. (1) Determine the role of ERα in the
protective effects of 17α-E2 against endolysosome dysfunction and synaptodendritic impairments, resulting
from combined exposure of HIV-1 proteins (gp120 and Tat), ART drugs, and methamphetamine. (2) Determine
the extent to which 17α-E2 affects cognitive impairment and the development of endolysosome dysfunction
and synaptodendritic impairments in HIV-1 Tg rats exposed with ART drugs and/or methamphetamine. The
proposed work is focused to determine the novel role of 17α-E2 and endolysosomes in sex-differences in
HAND with misuse of methamphetamine. Mechanistically, endolysosomes are critical sites, where 17α-E2, HIV
proteins, ART drugs, and methamphetamine intersect to affect synaptodendritic impairment and sex-
differences in HAND. The therapeutic potential of 17α-E2 will be determined using in vitro and in vivo models.
Results of these studies will help in understanding better sex-differences in HAND in the context of misuse of
methamphetamine and may provide a solid mechanistic basis for the development of 17α-E2-based therapies
against HAND. Thus, our proposed studies are responsive to NOT-DA-21-020 (Evaluation of sex differences
on HIV-associated comorbidities in the context of stimulant use)."
10843736,"Alzheimer’s disease is a major threat to public health. Because Alzheimer’s disease has no cure, it is critical to
identify its modifiable risk factors that can be targeted to reduce its burden. Although initial evidence suggests
its plausibility, relatively little attention has been paid to the role of common infections in Alzheimer’s disease
etiology. We propose to investigate the association of infection with common pathogens—Herpes Simplex
Virus Types 1 and 2, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr Virus, Toxoplasma gondii—measured four times over ~25
years, and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), with: (a) cognitive decline, and adjudicated mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia diagnoses; (b) plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease; and (c)
markers of physiological aging (telomere shortening, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, plasma-derived
senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, and epigenetic clocks). We will also explore sex, Alzheimer’s
disease risk genes, and stress-related exposures (mental disorders and their symptoms, stressful life events,
and poor sleep) as moderators that amplify the risk of adverse infection-induced cognitive, brain health, and
physiological aging outcomes. Inclusion of viral specific CD8 T-cell differentiation in combination with antibody
levels measured serially in the same individuals will allow us to distinguish between long-term infections and
reactivation and to evaluate the influence of the course of both infection and immune response to infection, on
our outcomes. Senescence-associated secretory phenotypes will point to novel senescent pathways by which
infections affect brain health. We will accomplish this using existing data and collecting new data from
participants in the Baltimore Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) Study Follow-up, which has been
assessed five times for >35 years (mean age = 70 years, range 58-100). Blood specimens have been collected
three times over ~25 years in the ECA, and we will collect an additional blood draw to obtain infection status at
four time points, providing a rare opportunity to quantify timing of exposure and reactivation of latent infections
in relation to cognitive and functional decline and Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and potential pathways. The
MPIs of the proposed study are currently completing Wave 5 of data collection in the ECA, including measures
of cognitive and functional decline, adjudicated MCI and dementia diagnoses, cellular aging and genome-wide
genetic and epigenetics assays. Our preliminary data in the ECA link common pathogens of interest with lower
cognitive performance and suggest effect modification by apolipoprotein E genotype. Our team consists of
experts in cognitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease, neurovirology, neuropsychology, Alzheimer’s disease
biomarkers, genetics and epigenetics, and the biology of aging. Results will clarify the extent to which
common infections increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and because this work is
performed in a longitudinal cohort, it will elucidate mechanisms, identify moderators and candidate pathways
which precede decline, thus informing future preventive, and perhaps therapeutic, efforts."

Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer world-wide and
afflicts more than 50,000 individuals in the U.S. each year. Because of its anatomic location and poor survival
rate HNSCC is a devastating disease. Treatment can lead to profound functional defects and disfigurement. In
the U.S., HNSCC incidence is increasing in large part due to the human papillomavirus (HPV). Although HPV-
driven HNSCC generally has a better outcome than its HPV-negative counterpart, smokers with HPV-driven
HNSCC demonstrate inferior oncologic outcomes and are clinically defined as intermediate risk disease. The
significant complexity of HNSCC biology results in a complex clinical scenario, in which some patients are
overtreated while others are undertreated, leading to unnecessary long-term side effects and suboptimal
clinical response.
In the laboratory, we discovered that HPV+ HNSCCs have unusually high expression of genes involved in
DNA damage and repair (DDR) and are highly sensitive to drugs targeting RAD51, a DDR protein functioning
in homologous recombination repair (HRR) that also protects cells from replication stress (RS). We
hypothesize that the HPV-driven biology of this genomic subset of HNSCC renders them more sensitive to
drugs targeting RS and HRR. We further hypothesize that HPV-neg HNSCC that share the same pattern of
overexpressed DDR genes may also be susceptible to drugs targeting RS/HRR. In this translational proposal,
we plan to: 1) Determine the efficacy and feasibility of replacing cisplatin with a RAD51 inhibitor to sensitize
tumors to radiation using preclinical models of HPV+ HNSCC; 2) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms
governing sensitivity of HPV+HNSCC to RAD51 inhibition; 3) Determine if drug combinations targeting RS or
HRR are efficacious in preclinical models of HNSCC. Progress in this area could lead directly to human clinical
trials that may improve tumor control with less toxicity."
10824317,"Black females have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity than any other racial-gender
group in the United States with 4 out of 5 adult black females being overweight or obese. Furthermore, adult
black females tend to lose less weight than whites undergoing the same obesity intervention regardless of
treatment modality. Reasons for racial differences in weight loss outcomes are not fully understood, but
suggest opportunities to further optimize obesity treatment approaches to reduce disparities. Behavioral weight
loss (BWL) interventions offer one approach that has demonstrated effectiveness in promoting modest weight
loss among some participants with obesity, but black females tend to lose less weight than their white
counterparts in the same BWL program. We hypothesize that the higher prevalence of chronic psychological
stress, which has been linked to weight gain over time and poorer weight loss in BWL programs, reported by
black females contributes to the disproportionate prevalence of obesity and suboptimal weight loss observed
among this group. Thus, stress management offers a novel approach to weight management for black females.
Our preliminary work suggests that incorporating a strong stress management component into an evidence-
based BWL program can potentially lead to better outcomes than an evidence-based BWL program alone. For
this proposal, we will test the effectiveness of a 12-month culturally-targeted, stress management-enhanced
BWL intervention on weight loss and stress reduction in a fully powered randomized, controlled trial (n=340).
Adult black females with obesity will be randomized to either a stress-management enhanced BWL
intervention (BWL-Stress) or the same BWL intervention alone (BWL-alone). The specific aims are to 1)
conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects on body weight of BWL-Stress compared to
BWL-Alone among adult black females with obesity and elevated stress, 2) evaluate intervention effects on
psychological stress as measured by a validated survey instrument and a stress biomarker, and 3) using a
multiple mediation model, test whether the relationship between the intervention and weight change is
mediated by perceived stress, energy intake, and physical activity. The primary outcome is weight change at
month 6. Secondary outcomes will include changes in stress measures (e.g., survey measures, cortisol), blood
glucose, energy intake, and physical activity at month 6. We will also assess process measures (e.g, treatment
adherence, treatment burden). We will also evaluate each outcome at month 12. This novel approach for
enhancing an evidence-based BWL program with culturally-targeted stress management strategies for black
females targets an understudied contributor to weight management among a population at high risk for obesity
and obesity-related chronic diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, cancer). This study will also elucidate behavioral
mechanisms linking our novel intervention to study outcomes. If proven effective, it would have significant
clinical and public health implications for weight management among black females."

10821364,"Project Summary
Heart failure progression is a complex biological process that is precipitated by the maladaptive
myocardial response to injury, compounded by failure of the adult heart to replace lost or damaged
cardiomyocytes. Our lab has previously outlined the regenerative capacity of the newborn
mammalian heart and outlined several mechanisms that regulate this process. Specifically, we
demonstrate that the endogenous regenerative capacity of the newborn heart is mediated by
proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes and is lost when cardiomyocytes exit cell cycle within
a few days after birth. We described several fundamental mechanisms that regulate cell cycle exit
of cardiomyocytes, including spontaneous DNA damage that occurs as a result of increased
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We also demonstrated that DNA damage activates DNA
damage response (DDR), which mediates cell cycle arrest of cardiomyocytes whereby inhibitors
of DDR prolong the window of cardiomyocyte proliferation. We also examined other potential
consequences of DNA damage, namely the formation of micronuclei, which is free cytoplasmic
DNA that often results from DNA damage during mitosis. Our preliminary results indicate that the
micronuclei are detected in cardiomyocytes at the time of cell cycle arrest. We also found that the
DNA sensing pathway cGAS-STING is induced in the postnatal heart within the same timeframe.
Intriguingly, inhibiting cGAS results in prolongation of the postnatal window of cardiomyocyte
proliferation. Therefore, this project will focus on the role of intra-cardiomyocyte cGAS-STING in
regulation of heart regeneration. We will examine the mechanism of activation of cGAS-STING in
cardiomyocytes, the effect of inhibiting cGAS-STING on cardiomyocyte proliferation, and the
downstream mechanisms that regulate cGAS function in cardiomyocytes."
10821372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Whereas it is long known that immune responses are pivotal to the heart’s reaction to stress, our understanding of
those events in myocardial remodeling occurring in response to afterload stress is limited. Recently, we reported a pivotal
role for cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes) in myocardial infarction. Going
forward, we uncovered evidence for a novel role of cGAS-STING in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy and failure. We
have discovered that loss of STING – surprisingly – exacerbated hypertrophy and fibrosis triggered by pressure stress.
We observed a marked increase in CD86, CD80, and CD28, signatures of T cell activation, and cytotoxic T cell
proliferation in STING-deficient hearts. In addition, CD103+ cells, representing the antigen presenting dendritic cell
population, are doubled in response to pressure overload in STING-deficient heart compared to WT. Furthermore, our
data reveal that STING is expressed in cardiac immune cells and fibroblasts, in contrast to cGAS, which is present
predominantly in macrophages. STING’s broader scope of distribution suggests a more prominent role in cardiac
hypertrophy. Based on this evidence, we propose studies focusing on STING to dissect the underlying molecular
circuitry. We hypothesize that STING regulates T cell activation and antigen presentation, adaptive immune processes
crucial to myocardial remodeling and development of heart failure, in the setting of afterload stress.
 Here, we propose studies to define and manipulate STING-dependent regulation of T cell function in afterload stress-
induced cardiac remodeling, focusing on both ventricular hypertrophy and ultimate contractile dysfunction. With an eye
toward ultimate translation to patients with heart disease, we also capitalize on pharmacological tools, some of which are
currently being tested in clinical trials in cancer, to manipulate STING signaling.
 The cGAS-STING pathway-mediated immune response, spanning both innate and adaptive elements, represents an
entirely novel mechanism of cardiac remodeling and failure. Furthermore, knowledge acquired during these studies is
likely to shed light on other forms of heart disease and elucidate cardiac complications of cancer immunotherapy.
 We propose a comprehensive series of studies to define the role of cGAS-STING in afterload-induced cardiac
remodeling. These studies interlace at many points with work proposed in the 3 other Projects. We have developed
multiple points of bidirectional collaboration across the entire Program, sharing of reagents and insights, as well as benefit
from extensive use of the Core facilities."
10866588,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) as a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are widely distributed in the
AD brain. The major constituent of NFTs is abnormal tau aggregates filling the intraneuronal and glial cell
body. Emerging evidence indicated that pathologic tau fibrils are capable of triggering a self-propagating
process in neurons and other brain cells that leads to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.
Experimental data have shown that intracranial injection of pathologic tau fibrils extracted from AD brains
results in substantial spreading of tau pathology in mouse brains and induces behavioral deficits. However,
therapeutic targets to block this pathologic tau spreading have not been identified. We identified for the first
time that lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3) is an essential receptor mediating the pathologic α-synuclein
transmission. Our preliminary studies further support that Lag3, as a cell surface receptor, mediates the
transmission of tau fibrils and pathologic tau-induced neuronal and microglial deficits. These results suggest
that Lag3 may serve as a novel target for blocking pathogenic tau spreading for therapeutic development. We
have established two mouse models of pathologic tau spreading with validated neuronal and behavioral
deficits as well as neuroinflammatory response. Of note, our preliminary data suggests that Lag3 protein is
expressed both in neurons and microglia, and depletion of Lag3 can inhibit tau neuronal propagation and
microglial activation. All these results support our central hypothesis that Lag3 is an essential receptor of
pathologic tau in neurons and microglia that mediates tau internalization, transmission and tauopathy. Now, it
is feasible to explore the role of Lag3 in facilitating tau pathogenesis and the therapeutic efficacy of Lag3
targeting via genetic deletion and monoclonal antibodies. Our goals are (1) to define the role of Lag3 in
mediating internalization of pathologic tau and the consequent neuronal and microglial responses involved in
the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies, and (2) to develop a clinical translatable strategy to inhibit
Lag3-mediated tau pathogenesis for the treatment of tauopathies. If successful, discoveries from this study will
identify a cell-surface receptor that mediates pathologic tau spreading and serve as a novel therapeutic target
for therapeutic development. This project may also provide novel molecular insights into key mediators of
pathologic tau spreading in neurons and other brain cells. Given the on-going clinical trials using anti-Lag3
antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, discoveries from this project will also facilitate the repurposing of these
anti-Lag3 antibodies for treating AD and other tauopathies."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is also the second leading cause of
cancer death in women. BC lethality is primarily caused by metastasis. African American (AA) women display
earlier onset of BC than Caucasian American (CA) women, are more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic types
of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) at the time of presentation, and have a significantly higher mortality rate.
Our long-term goal is to identify the biological factors underlying racial disparities in BC outcomes and to develop
novel clinical applications to eliminate such disparities. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that Semaphorin 6D
(SEMA6D) expression was dramatically lower in BC tissues than normal breast tissues. Of note, expression of
two prominent isoforms of SEMA6D were reduced in AA cancer tissues compared to CA cancer tissues. The
low expression level of SEMA6D correlates significantly with poor patient survival. Our analysis of protein
expression confirmed that expression of SEMA6D protein is also lower in AA BC tissues than in CA TNBC tissues.
Our functional test showed that overexpression of SEMA6D in BC cells dramatically reduced their metastasis in
vivo. To better understand the role of SEMA6D in BC, we performed single cell RNA-Sequencing analysis using
spontaneous mouse BC tumors. We found that SEMA6D-deficiency led to increased expression of metastatic
genes in tumor cells and enhanced accumulation of a group of immunosuppressive cells in the tumor
microenvironment. We hypothesize that SEMA6D inhibits BC metastasis via mechanisms involving both tumor-
intrinsic signaling and the tumor microenvironment, and that differential expression of SEMA6D is a causative
factor for outcome disparities observed between AA and CA patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism
underlying differential expression of SEMA6D by race in BC samples. In Aim 2, we will test the functional
significance of differential expression of SEMA6D in regulating metastasis of AA and CA cells. In Aim 3, we will
elucidate the mechanism by which SEMA6D suppresses metastasis of AA and CA TNBC cells. Accomplishing
this study will provide crucial clues for understanding the biological basis for BC racial disparities and will facilitate
development of novel diagnostic/therapeutic approaches to eliminate such disparities."

in women. In just the US alone, it is estimated that more than 268,000 women will be diagnosed with an invasive
form of breast cancer this year. Therefore, there is a substantially unmet medical need to identify novel
mechanisms of breast cancer etiology and therapeutic approaches that will significantly improve the lives of
these patients. Moreover, triple negative breast carcinoma ranks among the most aggressive forms known, with
severely limited treatment options while accounting for 12% of total tumors diagnosed. This new application
proposes to investigate the role of mitostatin to establish feasibility and provide proof of concept for our central
hypothesis that mitostatin drives mitophagy to suppress breast cancer proliferation and migration. This working
hypothesis is based on several key observations. Mitostatin localizes to mitochondria and is frequently found to
be mutated or is significantly reduced or absent. We have discovered that mitostatin expression is significantly
reduced across numerous subtypes of breast cancer. Strikingly, we found that patients with a high tumor
expression of mitostatin was significantly correlated to have improved relapse free survival in total breast cancer
as well as in triple negative circumstances. We have further discovered that mitostatin is required for stimulus-
dependent mitophagy and is able to concurrently suppress proliferation and migration from 2D and 3D matrices.
Therefore, these preliminary data indicate that mitostatin is of high clinical and biological relevance and is of
potential importance to help stop the progression of breast cancer. The precise mechanism(s) mitostatin uses to
exert these oncosuppressive functions remain unknown; and further, whether mitostatin-dependent mitophagy
is required to suppress breast cancer proliferation and migration.
Therefore, we plan to examine the following to decipher the in vitro and in vivo role of mitostatin in breast cancer:
Aim #1: Decipher the mechanism of mitostatin-evoked mitophagy and the connection to suppressed breast
cancer growth and migration
Aim #2: Utilize novel mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis to investigate the in vivo role of mitostatin-driven
mitophagy and suppression of growth.
These innovative studies will greatly augment our understanding of the mechanisms governing mitostatin to
evoke mitophagy as a new way to combat breast cancer proliferation and migration. The short-term impact will
be to provide proof-of-concept and feasibility that targeting mitochondria vis-à-vis mitostatin is a valid approach.
The long-term impact will be to develop novel therapeutic strategies, based on mitostatin evoked mitophagy, to
effectively stop breast cancer and improve the lives of patients."

While rural health care disparities are becoming a clear national crisis, the unique challenges faced by rural
Americans are rarely discussed in today’s engineering classroom. Close to 20% of the United States
population live in rural communities and face issues that are less common than their urban
counterparts. According to the CDC, rural communities are at risk for a higher percentage of excess deaths
from the 5 leading causes of death (cancer, heart disease, CLRD, unintentional injury, and stroke). Technical
engineering innovations have the potential to address rural disparities. But to do so, explicit efforts must be
made to expose future engineers to the healthcare challenges faced by rural America today.
 The goal of this proposal is to address the lack of focus on rural healthcare disparities in engineering
classrooms. We believe that immersing bioengineering student groups in rural communities and hospitals will
promote the identification of innovative engineering design solutions that can address rural healthcare
disparities, encourage some students to work with the communities to find long term solutions, and establish a
curriculum that supports career paths that seek to address rural healthcare disparities.
The first aim of this program is to enhance rural health co-creation through partnerships. We will establish a
clinical immersion co-creation program for a subset of NU bioengineering students in Maine rural health care
facilities. Teams of students will work with Maine track medical students and clinicians over the course of 6
weeks to identify design opportunities emphasizing the concept of co-creation. The second aim is to scale the
capstone design program at Northeastern by establishing a team-based approach to integrating the broader
NU bioengineering community into design for rural health. Recognizing that not all students can participate in
the clinical immersion, the rural healthcare teams will create a compendium of rural healthcare needs to serve
as design projects for the capstone bioengineering course, allowing up to 36 students per year to participate in
rural engineering design. The final aim is to Establish a pathway for students to implement their solutions. We
seek to avoid a “hit and run” problem, where students enter a community they seek to serve only to leave and
not sustain the relationship and implement sustainable solutions. After completing capstone design, students
will have the opportunity to enter a one-year Roux Institute startup residency program that connects early-
stage businesses to resources and best practices from across the university’s global network, providing a
platform for implementing solutions in Maine.
We believe that the proposed approach will establish a model for not only distributing students throughout the
Maine rural health care system for opportunity identification but the development of the relevant curriculum to
support students in co-creation and innovative design for rural communities."
10843267,"Oxidative stress erodes the integrity of DNA by modifying DNA bases and has been linked to cancer,
neurological disorders and aging. The NEIL glycosylases initiate base excision repair of oxidized base lesions
by catalyzing the cleavage of the N-glycosidic linkage to the 2’-deoxyribose and are capable of removing a
wide array of modified DNA bases. The NEIL glycosylases are unique in acting in a variety of different
contexts beyond duplex DNA, such as ssDNA, and G-quadruplexes, that has suggested that these enzymes
play central roles in repair, replication and transcription. We have shown that hydantoin lesions, that are
formed formed under conditions of high oxidative stress, and in G-rich sequences such as G-quadruplexes, are
the best substrates for the NEIL glycosylases. Our laboratory was also the first to provide a direct link between
RNA editing and DNA repair by showing lesion processing by NEIL1 is modulated by an RNA editing reaction
that changes the codon for amino acid position 242 in the lesion recognition loop of the enzyme, switching the
residue from the genomically encoded lysine to an arginine. This change alters NEIL1 glycosylase rate
constants in a lesion and DNA context dependent manner. Lesion identity and context also influences the
extent of NEIL1 base excision, and this lesion binding property suggest roles in regulating replication and
transcription. We have also uncovered unique differences between the NEIL1 and NEIL3 in the removal of
hydantoin lesions from different G-quadruplex sequences. The presence of different G-quadruplex sequences
in gene promoters, curiously in the DNA repair enzymes themselves, suggests that the observed differences in
extents of lesion excision, and the presence of non-productive binding, may alter transcription in response to
oxidative stress. These observations further implicate NEIL enzymes in processes beyond classic BER, and
further underscore the tight interdependence of nucleic acid transactions. This project will entail using a multi-
faceted approach involving enzymology, nucleic acid chemistry, biophysical methods and cellular assays to
probe the lesion and context dependent properties of NEIL1, 2 and 3 to make direct connections between
molecular defects in particular aspects of damage recognition and base excision on preventing DNA mutations
and altering gene transcription."

 Older adults are the fastest-growing group of cannabis users in the US. Older adults use cannabis for a variety
of reasons, including pain, insomnia, anxiety, and for recreation. Cannabis can, however, also exert robust
effects on cognition. Almost all research on cannabis/cannabinoids and cognition has been conducted in young
adults, and largely shows that acute administration impairs mnemonic and executive functions mediated by the
medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex (which are also those most vulnerable to decline in aging and age-
related neurodegenerative disease). In contrast, a few studies suggest that cannabinoids can exert distinct
effects on the aged compared to the young brain, and preliminary data from our labs show that cannabis can
actually enhance cognition selectively in aged rats. Indeed, cannabinoids have been proposed as potential
treatments for the age-related neurodegenerative condition Alzheimer's disease (AD), and some preclinical
research shows that cannabinoids can attenuate markers linked to AD pathology (e.g., neuroinflammation).
Aging studies evaluating cannabis to date, however, are very limited and have not employed either cannabis
itself or routes of administration that model those used most frequently by people (smoking and oral
consumption). As such, it is unclear how cannabis, as it is actually used, affects cognitive decline and the
synaptic dysfunction and AD-like pathology that contribute to cognitive impairments in older subjects.
 The long-term goal of our program is to determine how cannabis affects cognitive decline in aging and AD,
and to determine the mechanisms of such effects. The objective of the current proposal is to model the two
most common routes of human cannabis use (smoking and oral consumption) in well-characterized rat models
of age-related cognitive decline, and to use these models to begin to elucidate effects of cannabis on behavioral
and neurobiological dysfunction associated with aging and AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that cannabis
can benefit cognition in aging by attenuating age-associated synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and tau
pathology. Aim 1 will determine how acute cannabis affects performance in young adult and aged rats, as well
as the synaptic mechanisms supporting effects of cannabis on cognition in aged subjects. Aim 2 will assess
effects of chronic cannabis on cognition in young adult and aged rats, as well as on excitatory/inhibitory signaling
and inflammatory markers linked to age-related cognitive impairments. Aim 3 will assess effects of chronic
cannabis on AD-like tau pathology and cognition using a novel, targeted AAV-based approach in aged rats. The
proposed experiments will be significant because they will provide foundational data concerning whether and
how cannabis administration relevant for human consumption yields benefits for age-related cognitive decline
and neuropathology."

Children with craniosynostosis typically undergo surgical treatment to remove the brain growth constraints and
correct for the malformations produced a volume overgrowth parallel to the fused sutures that compensates for
the local growth restrictions. However, there is a large variability of surgical techniques and outcomes among
institutions, and it is common for patients with suboptimal treatments to require additional invasive surgeries for
three main reasons: (1) local volume anomalies and their progression have not been characterized to estimate
how much local volume patients need during treatment; (2) our knowledge about how treatment modifies
cranial growth is limited and post-surgical growth predictions are not possible; and (3) there are no objective
and personalized methods to evaluate long-term outcomes, so treatment selection remains subjective.
Although our team and others have created methods to quantify cranial and head shape anomalies using
imaging data, existing methods cannot characterize the abnormal patterns of local volume development in
craniosynostosis, are age-agnostic, and do not account for sex, which is an essential modulator of
development. Moreover, our recently created data-driven normative cranial bone development model cannot
be used to predict growth of a surgically modified cranium, and large post-surgical datasets have not been
traditionally available to characterize volume development after treatment of patients with craniosynostosis.
This limited knowledge about the abnormal pre- and post-surgical local volume development has hindered the
translation of existing methods to plan, quantify, compare and predict surgical outcomes. Hence, treatment
selection remains subjective and the identification of relapsing patients still relies on subjective interpretation of
variable clinical symptoms with low predictive value.
We demonstrated that CT and 3D photogrammetry provide the same quantification of head anatomy, and
Children’s Hospital Colorado incorporated pre- and post-surgical 3D photogrammetry acquisition in the
standard clinical protocol of patients with craniosynostosis. In this project, we will leverage our retrospective
dataset to characterize local head volume development in patients with craniosynostosis before surgery, study
how treatment modifies growth patterns and identify relapsing patients using objective data. The main goals of
this project are: (1) to quantitatively characterize the local head volume distributions and their temporal
progression in patients with craniosynostosis; and (2) to predict and evaluate local head volume growth after
treatment of craniosynostosis. This project will create the necessary objective and quantitative knowledge to
achieve personalized optimal treatments, and software tools to objectively evaluate patients using non-invasive
3D photogrammetry before and after surgical treatment."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is the major form of human diabetes, accounting for approximately 90–95% of diagnosed diabetes cases in the United States. Our goal in this proposal is to elucidate a novel neural mechanism of glucose regulation that could significantly advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D. The brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS), traditionally viewed as a cardiovascular regulatory system, has recently emerged as a critical part of metabolic and energy-expenditure signaling systems. However, whether the brain RAS play a role in glycemia regulation, and if so, via what signaling mechanisms, constitute major gaps in our knowledge. The (pro)renin receptor (PRR), a key component of the RAS, mediates both formation of angiotensin II (Ang II) – a major bioactive peptide of the RAS – and Ang II-independent signaling in the central nervous system (CNS). In this proposal, we provide important preliminary data supporting the concept that the PRR in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, termed THPVN neurons, is a novel modulator of glycemia. Accordingly, this proposal seeks to uncover a novel role of THPVN neurons and the PRR in the regulation of glycemia and investigate the underlying molecular and synaptic mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that that PRR signaling in THPVN neurons drives autonomic responses that impair glucose homeostasis, and that activation of this neural pathway contributes to glucose metabolic impairment during HFD consumption. To test this hypothesis, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining in vivo telemetric glucose monitoring, chemogenic techniques employing DREADDs (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs), in vitro electrophysiology, and TH neuron-specific targeting in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Successful completion of the proposed project will advance our understanding of a novel role and mechanisms of the brain PRR and THPVN neurons in the autonomic regulation of glucose homeostasis and provide a potential therapeutic target for T2D."

Opioids target the mu opioid receptor (MOR). Opioid use is essentially motivated by pain relief and/or
reward-seeking, however opioid abuse is strongly driven by other factors that include aversive emotional
aspects of opioid withdrawal, which are at the center of this proposal. Here, we hypothesize that MOR-
expressing neurons of the medial habenula (hereafter called MHb-MOR neurons) play a key role in the
development of negative emotional responses characterizing opioid withdrawal. The proposal is
based on four premises: (i) the MHb has become a recognized aversion center in addiction research, (ii)
MOR-expressing neurons are highly abundant in the MHb, (iii) MOR-expressing neurons of the MHb
modulate aversive states (our recent publication) and (iv) MOR-MHb neurons project to the raphe nucleus
(RN), a major center for mood control (our unpublished data).
 Overall, we speculate that stimulating MHb-MOR neurons enhances the negative emotional
experience of opioid withdrawal, whereas silencing these neurons alleviates the negative affect of
withdrawal. Manipulating MOR-neurons has now become possible, as we have created a new transgenic
MOR-Cre mouse line (unpublished). These mice will be used to manipulate MHb-MOR neurons in two
behavioral models of short- (Aim 1) and long- (Aim 2) term withdrawal well established in our laboratory,
and behavioral hallmarks of negative affect and their associated brain connectivity patterns will be
studied. Aim 1 will use optogenetics to interrogate the contribution of MHb-MOR neurons in conditioned
place aversion to low dose naloxone, and fMRI to characterize whole brain functional connectivity (WBFC)
of the naloxone-evoked aversive state. Aim 2 will use chemogenetics to interrogate the contribution of
MHb-MOR neurons in depressive-like behavior and social interaction deficits that develop upon prolonged
withdrawal, and fMRI to identify the causal role of MHb-MOR in WBFC patterns alterations.
 Innovative aspects of this proposal are: (i) the focus on the function of MOR-expressing neurons for
the first time; (ii) the notion that MOR neurons modulates activity of an aversion brain center (the MHb),
providing a yet unexplored mechanistic angle on aversive states of opioid withdrawal; (iii) the study of a
poorly known neural pathway (MHb/IPN/DRN microcircuitry), which has strong relevance to both addiction
and depression research, (iv) the analysis of brain wide adaptations to chronic morphine using animal fMRI
and (v) the translational potential for human research in growing efforts to fight the opioid crisis.
 We anticipate discovering novel neural mechanisms contributing to the negative affect of
opioid withdrawal, and relevant to opioid use disorders. In the long-term, fMRI signatures may be
translatable to human research. This proposal has strong basic and clinical implications, and can uniquely
be developed by our team at the Douglas Research Center, McGill University Montréal.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD) is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, even
in optimally treated patients. While the impact of many immune cell types on atherosclerosis is well-
established, the contribution of CD8+ T cells to the disease pathology remains to be further elucidated. In
previous work using unbiased single-cell (sc) analyses to study the immune composition of human
atherosclerotic plaques we found new dysregulations tissue resident memory (TRM) CD8+ T cells associated
with clinical CV outcomes. CD8+ T cell infiltrates have been described in both early and advanced human
atherosclerotic plaques and their cytotoxic effector functions contribute to plaque progression in mice.
However, information on how CD8+ T cells contribute to atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and cardiovascular
(CV) events is limited and remains to be fully understood. In preliminary sc studies, we identified the
transcriptional regulator Zeb 2 as a top candidate master regulator of plaque CD8+ T cell proatherogenic
alterations. We hypothesize that Zeb2 is a key driver of the activation and cytotoxicity of effector TRM CD8+ T
cells in atherosclerotic plaques and that these alterations contribute to disease progression and plaque
vulnerability. We also contend that its downregulation is implicated in the reprogramming of PD-1+ TRM CD8+ T
cells found in plaques of patients with recent stroke. We propose two independent aims to study the role of
Zeb2 in plaque vulnerability and CV events. In Aim 1, we will dissect the Zeb2-mediated activation of plaque
TRM CD8+ T cells and determine their association with plaque vulnerability at pathology. In this Aim we will also
determine the effect of Zeb2 deficiency selectively in activated TRM CD8+ on atherosclerosis in mice. In Aim 2,
we will identify how Zeb2 mediates TRM CD8+ T cell dysregulations of adverse CV outcomes and determine
how Zeb2 downregulation in all CD8+ T cell affect their exhaustion reprogramming and whether these
alterations contribute to plaque size and vulnerability in vivo. These studies will address important gaps in
knowledge in CD8+ T cell biology in atherosclerosis, and will tackle previously unappreciated cellular and
molecular mechanisms associated with plaque rupture/erosion that may contribute to clinical CV outcomes.
We foresee that this information may help guide the future design of precise, molecularly targeted
immunotherapies to prevent CV outcomes in patients with carotid and coronary disease."

Leveraging the power of the human genome to understand the risks, causes, and treatments of human dis-
ease remains a grand challenge for all of biology and medicine. While sequencing costs have plummeted, and
clinical implementation has become commonplace, interpreting human genomes remains a highly challenging
task. It is our hypothesis that understanding the function of the genome and its products at a molecular, tissue,
and phenotypic level using advanced machine learning will help unlock the door to better interpretation for sci-
entific discovery and better clinical outcomes based on genomic medicine. To that end, our team has spent
the past two decades working to develop computational models of biology, to predict how those models are
perturbed through changes in the genome, and to use those perturbations to model phenotype and disease.
We have had many research outputs in this area, having developed and published a number of widely used
methods that predict biochemical and phenotypic changes caused by genetic variants to infer phenotype and
pathogenicity. However, we believe that there is a coming convergence between the variability in clinical inter-
pretation, high-throughput biotechnology assays, and modern machine learning methodology that will result in
more accurate clinical assessments and improved clinical care. Therefore, in this ambitious proposal, we are
addressing important questions in variant and genome interpretation consistent with this view and the mission
of the IGVF Consortium. Our major goals include (1) developing advanced semi-supervised approaches to
predict variants that disrupt molecular function and/or are capable of altering phenotypes; (2) identifying in-
formative assays, variants, and genes to automate experimental design with an emphasis on resource alloca-
tion and reduction of ascertainment bias in the Consortium; and (3) developing machine learning approaches
to integrate these models into a workflow of the IGVF Consortium and enable the interaction between compu-
tation and experiment in order to catalyze advances in both genetic variant interpretation and predictive model
development."

We seek renewed support for our highly productive postdoctoral Training program in Recovery and
Restoration of CNS Health and Function following acute injury. The launch of this program has coincided
with rapid growth in the investigation of neurorecovery nationally and internationally. Locally, this training
program has been at the center of a substantial expansion of clinical, translational, and research activities
in neurorecovery, including the launch of an innovative clinical fellowship and recruitment of several new
research faculty. Furthermore, the program has successfully recruited participants in addition to those
supported directly through this mechanism, enriching the training experience for faculty and postdoctoral
fellows. The overall goals of the Training program in Recovery and Restoration of CNS Health and
Function remain to provide essential research training to clinician-scientists, neuroengineers, and
computational neuroscientists who can then go on to produce and apply discoveries that can restore
function to patients who survive disabling brain injuries. To harness both local and national opportunities
for our trainees, we have redesigned the program to create a more focused environment, anchored in the
rich ecosystem of Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The Center for
Neurotechnology and Neurorecovery will serve as home base for all fellows. We have recruited a
distinguished biostatistician to serve on our faculty and executive committee who will oversee a rigorous
curriculum in experimental design, statistics, quantitative literacy and approaches. This curriculum will be
part of a formal weekly seminar program that we have constructed explicitly for our program trainees. In
addition, we have designed a career development curriculum to provide trainees with essential skills in
communication, grant-writing, diversity and inclusion, and all other aspects of career development.
Recruitment will focus on diversity, including those with disabilities, women and trainees from backgrounds
underrepresented in medicine and engineering. Leveraging MGH’s substantial investment in Equity,
Diversity and Inclusion, we have integrated this expertise into the Executive Committee, Faculty, and
Advisory Committee. The program will continue active participation by an accomplished, multidisciplinary
faculty drawn from anesthesia, engineering, computational neuroscience, neurology, neurosurgery,
physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, and radiology. Mentors and research experiences will
cover four themes: 1) Clinical Research and Clinical Trials, 2) Computational Neuroscience, 3) From
Neural Recording to Neural Imaging, 4) Neural Repair and Neuromodulation. Support is requested for 4
post-doctoral trainees per year, each of whom will be supported for 2 years. Trainees will spend a
minimum of 2 years in the program. The program will combine a mentored research project within one of
the theme areas with specific coursework tailored to the theme area chosen by the trainee."

scientists. It enjoys robust institutional support, a large and diverse body of 135 outstanding and well-funded
research mentors, and an integrated health science campus with adjacent clinical and research facilities. Utah’s
MD-PhD program recruits from across the country, but is uniquely attractive to students from the vast
Intermountain West region, with no other MSTP within 500 miles, making it a potential new regional hub for
students pursuing physician-scientist training. The accelerating momentum of the Program is evident in the
tripling of applications and doubling of class size since 2017. The high quality of trainees and the training
environment are evidenced by the excellent F30 success rate over the past 5 years (67%). Trainee outcomes
are strong, with an 84% MD-PhD completion rate (100% receiving at least an MD or PhD), high research
productivity (average of 6.9 publications per trainee, with 2.7 as first/co-first author), and 96% of MD-PhD
graduates pursuing residency training. In the past 3 years, 40% of incoming students are from NIH-defined
underrepresented groups.
The proposed MSTP would further optimize the training program with increased integration between the MD and
PhD phases, an improved governance structure with extensive trainee participation, enhanced diversity
recruiting, rigorous day-one lab safety training, enhanced mentor training, and detailed program evaluation. A
key focus will be smoothing the transitions between research and clinical training via Program activities and
curriculum, including a practice clerkship, longitudinal clinical experience during the PhD years, and a proposal
preparation course that readies trainees for departmental preliminary exams. The proposed program plan will
also emphasize rigor and reproducibility, as well as the responsible conduct of research with formal training and
integration into community events (monthly meetings, annual retreat). An extensive array of community and
wellness resources ensure that trainees are well-supported during this intense, but highly rewarding training.
Four trainee slots are requested in year 1, and 8 slots are requested in years 2-5. Each trainee will be supported
for their first two years, but will follow the proposed Program Plan for the entirety of their MD-PhD training."

In the United States, new HIV infections continue at a high level, with an estimated 37,515 Americans receiving
an HIV diagnosis each year. In 2019, the “Ending the HIV Epidemic” (EHE) plan for the United States was
developed with the goal of reducing new HIV infections by 75% by 2025, and by at least 90% by 2030,
representing an effort to refocus national attention on ending the domestic HIV epidemic. The need for nurse
scientists who can plan and conduct rigorous and innovative research in HIV prevention and care, including
implementation science is greater today than ever. To address this need, we propose to launch the “Next
Generation Nurse Scientists Ending the HIV Epidemic” program in the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) School of Nursing. The overarching goal of this T32 program is to train a diverse cadre of nurse
scientists in research methods to lead efforts to End the HIV Epidemic. This program will (1) Increase the
number of nurse scholars, especially from underrepresented groups (e.g. race, ethnicity, sexual and gender
minority, and first generation to college), who are prepared with the knowledge and skills necessary: to design
and conduct research that advances the science on HIV, HIV interventions, and HIV implementation strategies;
to design and test intervention strategies with populations experiencing intersecting stigmas, including sexual
and gender minorities, people of color, populations with multiple co-morbidities, and people who use drugs; to
employ implementation science methods for studying translation of HIV interventions into real-world clinical
and community settings, including in the context of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic; (2) Mentor trainees to
identify a specific area of HIV research that will allow them to establish a program of research that outlines
their content and methods expertise; (3) Prepare trainees with grantsmanship and leadership skills to
conceptualize, write, conduct, administer, and disseminate results for an extramural grant-funded study, and
(4) Conduct an evaluation of Program to determine process and outcome. This training program will be
delivered within the research-intensive academic setting of UCSF, with extensive opportunities for cross-
disciplinary collaboration with entities such as the AIDS Research Institute, the Center for AIDS Research, and
the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies, along with clinical settings that include the original San Francisco
Model clinic Ward 86 at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. With a focus on nursing approaches to
prevention and care, this program will also build on over 20 years of the HIV/AIDS Nursing Care and
Prevention Training Program (T32NR07081), which produced many nurse scientists who have gone on to be
leaders in HIV nursing research in the
United States
and beyond. The “Next Generation Nurse Scientists
Ending the HIV Epidemic” program will include training opportunities for 4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral nurse
scholars each year. Our goal is to train the next generation of scientists in nursing research approaches to End
the HIV Epidemic."

This application aims to renew the Clinical Research in Digestive Diseases (CRDD) Training
Program (T32 DK062708). This training program, continuously funded since 2003, has an
excellent track record of preparing physician-scientists for successful careers in clinical
research. In the past 19 years (2003-2022), 81% of our 22 program graduates have attained
research-intensive (45%) or research-related (36%) academic positions. During this time, our 22
graduates have earned 21 academic appointments, 15 K-equivalent (career development)
awards, and 25 R, U, or equivalent senior research awards. The objective of the program is to
develop future independent investigators in GI and hepatology clinical research by providing
selected fellows with: (1) core skills in the design and execution of clinical research; and (2) a
structured, mentored research experience under the guidance of our world-class Core Faculty.
This application proposes to support a total of 3 postdoctoral research fellows with one enrolled
each year for a 3-year training period, beginning after their first clinical year of GI fellowship
training. The rationale for this training program is that (1) gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases
are major causes of morbidity and mortality with evolving epidemiology and increasing burden;
(2) digestive diseases are propelled by complex processes in need of multidisciplinary
approaches; and (3) the field faces a threatened pipeline of diverse investigators committed to
careers studying digestive diseases, particularly after the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The design of our training program includes (1) recruitment of talented, diverse candidates
committed to careers in research; (2) an immersive, individualized training plan for program
trainees; and (3) deliberate preparation of program graduates for independently successful
careers. All trainees participate in a mentored research experience, supported by a research
advisory committee. Trainees are selected in a separate clinical research match when they
apply for clinical training. All trainees acquire a master's degree in clinical research methods
during their second year of fellowship, which is the first year of research training. The core
curriculum includes research design and statistics, training in responsible research conduct and
reproducible research practices, communication skills, grant writing, and career development.
New research areas added since the last renewal include: (1) machine learning and deep
learning methods; (2) data science and precision medicine; (3) adaptive and platform trial
design; and (4) health equity. Based on feedback from our current fellows and many successful
alumni, we are continuously improving this successful T32 training program."

The goal of this research program is to elucidate the proteins and mechanisms that regulate transcription
within the context of chromatin, a process critical to every eukaryotic cell. Nucleosomes pose barriers to RNA
polymerase II (Pol II) that must be overcome for accurate and efficient gene expression, and whose properties
and interactions are modulated by post-translational modification. During transcription elongation, a conserved
set of factors assembles with Pol II and facilitates its transit by altering the stability, positioning, and post-
translational modification states of nucleosomes. The proposal addresses three major challenges related to
these functions of eukaryotic transcription elongation factors. (1) What are the mechanisms by which
transcription elongation factors couple chromatin changes, including histone modifications, to RNA synthesis?
(2) How are the patterns of these epigenetic modifications determined? (3) What are the primary versus
indirect functions of core components of the Pol II elongation machinery? These questions will be approached
through a comprehensive analysis of the Paf1 complex (Paf1C) and proteins with which it interacts. Paf1C is a
highly conserved transcription elongation factor that globally associates with Pol II on the bodies of active
genes. The multifunctional nature of Paf1C affords a unique opportunity to reveal how transcription is coupled
to co-transcriptional events. To this end, a multifaceted approach comprising innovative genetic and proteomic
screens, mechanistic biochemistry, and genomics will be deployed. This project will determine how Paf1C
stimulates critical histone modifications and interfaces with a chromatin remodeling factor with genetic links to
prostate cancer. In-depth studies of the interactions between Paf1C and the Pol II elongation complex will
uncover the molecular mechanisms that spatially constrain Paf1C-dependent chromatin changes to active
genes. Finally, the primary and subunit-specific functions of Paf1C, as well as the cellular pathways that
compensate for its absence, will be determined. The studies will be performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
capitalize on the sophisticated tools developed for that system. Given the strong conservation of all proteins
and histone modifications studied, the conceptual advances that arise from this work will have direct
implications for the understanding of gene regulation in humans, where defects in this process cause a wide
range of cancers and other diseases."

 Rotator cuff tears are present in approximately 20% of the population and result in mechanical
unloading of the rotator cuff muscle. As a result, the muscle undergoes atrophy, which negatively impacts
clinical outcomes of surgical repair. Recent work has shown reduction in rotator cuff muscle
degeneration after transplantation of mesenchymal-derived stem cells (MSCs). However, MSC-based
therapies for musculoskeletal diseases have been plagued by sub-optimal efficacy, due, in part, to lack of
effective methods to 1) reach therapeutically relevant numbers of highly potent cells, and 2) retain cells
at the site of injury once transplanted. Therefore, we hypothesize that that culture and injection of MSCs
on microparticle carriers designed to promote therapeutic potency (reduced senescence and a pro-
regenerative secretome) will result in greater cellular retention in the damaged muscle, and improved
supraspinatus muscle regeneration after tendon reattachment.
 The objective of this application is to determine 1) the relationship between biomaterial carrier
properties, cell metabolism, and therapeutic fitness of seeded MSCs, and 2) how transplanting cells with
high fitness on materials to improve local retention ultimately affects the level of regeneration of rotator
cuff muscle after surgical repair of the torn tendon. This objective will be approached through the
following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of altering the biochemical composition of the biomaterial
carrier on metabolism and replicative senescence of human MSCs during expansion, 2) Evaluate effects
of altering the biochemical composition of the biomaterial carrier on secretion of pro-regenerative factors
by human MSCs, and 3) Evaluate the effects of transplantation of MSCs after culture on carriers
determined from Aims 1&2 on regeneration in the rat supraspinatus muscle after tendon reattachment.
 The proposed work is innovative because it focuses on design of material substrates to engineer the
secretome of transplanted cells in order to promote tissue healing after rotator cuff tear, as well as
provides an important early metabolomics-based screening technique for the effects of substrate
properties on cellular therapeutic fitness. Results from these studies are expected to have an important
positive impact because they will lead to more efficacious regenerative medicine therapies for rotator cuff
tears, and may further lead to more effective cell-based therapies for a wide variety of diseases."

Developmental biology, an interdisciplinary science at the leading edge of modern biomedical research,
integrates stem-cell and molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and whole-animal model systems. This
Developmental Biology Training Grant (DBTG) application requests support for eight predoctoral and three
postdoctoral trainees in an interdepartmental Developmental Biology Training Program, consisting of
individualized research training under the guidance of 48 faculty members in nine PhD degree-granting
departments at the University of Utah. The Internal Advisory Board (IAB) selects Trainees through a formal
application process and NIH study section-style review. Predoctoral Trainees who have completed their
qualifying exams in the Biosciences Programs or the MD/PhD Program are supported for up to two years, and
Postdoctoral Trainees are also supported for up to two years. Both groups are selected from a highly
competitive pool, based on excellence in previous research, a research proposal, and letters of
recommendation. Trainees will be mentored to apply for individual F30/F31/F32 fellowships or other nationally
competitive awards to enhance their career development. Success for Predoctoral Fellows will be measured by
by successful individual fellowship awards, PhD graduation, and obtaining their next step professional
advancement (typically postdoctoral positions). Success for Postdoctoral Fellows will be measured by next
step professional advancement, typically faculty positions or leadership positions in biotech or other biomedical
research programs. MPIs stay in touch with former trainees and continue to serve as career advisors.
This Program uses ten mechanisms for value-added training of these carefully chosen and especially
competitive Predoctoral and Postdoctoral Trainees: twice-monthly Developmental Biology Discussion Group
meetings; didactic coursework focused on Developmental Biology and science ethics; DBTG Sponsored
Seminars; experience in hosting visitors and national Symposia; funding and preparation for Trainee
presentations at national scientific conferences; training in the effective utilization of Predoctoral and
Postdoctoral Individual Development Plans (IDPs); unique Postdoctoral Mentoring committees that add
significant guidance to each Postdoctoral Trainee’s career development; an innovative Mentor-the-Mentor
program that enhances the faculty’s ability to mentor Trainees; opportunities for Grant/Fellowship Writing
Workshops; and a highly successful DBTG Annual Retreat. The Program actively solicits and implements
recommendations from Trainees, Mentors, IAB and External Advisory Board (EAB).
With leading researchers in multiple model organisms, this Program has an exceptional track record of training
predoctoral and postdoctoral scientists in the interdisciplinary field of Developmental Biology and preparing
them to direct their own first-rate independent research programs."

The Population Studies and Training Center of Brown University (PSTC) requests continuing support for its
T32 National Research Service Award. The long-term goal of the PSTC Demography Training Program is to
prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral social scientists to become internationally renowned population
investigators and scholars. More concretely, our objectives are to promote research, publication, and grant
funding among trainees during and after training. We request support for five predoctoral trainees and one
postdoctoral trainee. In this application, we provide evidence of a strong interdisciplinary training program,
supported by productive, committed faculty, focused on training doctoral candidates and postdoctoral fellows
from Anthropology, Economics, Sociology, and Public Health. We demonstrate that the PSTC training program
shows ample evidence of continued intellectual and organizational evolution and dynamic synergy across
disciplines and career stages, from new trainee through senior scholar, and a commitment to excellence that
will produce the highest quality population science scholars. We show excellent recruitment, retention and
placement outcomes in the previous grant period, and we focus on maintaining this excellence while improving
professionalization and enhancing young scholars’ paths to future independence with this new application.
The PSTC training program proposed here builds on a dynamic research infrastructure. Guided by the NICHD
mission to support research, data collection, and research training in demography, reproductive health, and
population health, the PSTC makes distinctive intellectual contributions in five primary areas: Migration and
Urbanization; Population, Development, and Environment; Children, Families, and Health; Reproductive Health
and HIV/AIDS; and Social Foundations of Health Disparities. PSTC research is methodologically broad and
innovative, with unique contributions to methods in anthropological demography, spatial and contextual
approaches, and research design and causal inference. Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees are integrated
into all these areas. Their training is advanced through coursework, mentored research, working groups,
colloquia, methods modules, and professionalization workshops. We show evidence of major institutional
support in the form of physical space, significant investments in graduate education generally, and targeted
funds to support trainees. Predoctoral trainees are typically selected for T32 funding for one or two years
during second or third year of graduate school. An active Training Committee supervises the design of the
program and coordinates with our participating departments. The Training Director supports the day-to-day
operation of the program. We describe both continuing and innovative organizational and pedagogical efforts
to secure the training goals we outline in this application."
10754972,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder leading to dementia. Periodontitis, a chronic,
inflammatory disease, induces systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Studies indicate that
patients with periodontitis may be at higher risk of developing AD. Our preliminary data have shown
that succinate, a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) from mice with periodontitis. Succinate can act as a signaling ligand extracellularly through
succinate receptor (SUCNR1). We showed that microglial cells express SUCNR1. Interestingly,
knockout (KO) of SUCNR1 significantly reduced the increases of IL1β and microglial activation induced
by periodontitis in mice. The IL1β expression stimulated by administration of succinate or a key
periodontal pathogen Fusobacteria nucleatum (Fn) lysate was significantly reduced in the primary
microglial cells derived from KO mice. We further demonstrated that succinate can stimulated the growth
and virulent gene expression of Fn and altered the oral microbiome in mice. In response to Funding
Opportunity Announcement “Research on Current Topics in Alzheimer's Disease and Its Related
Dementias” (PAR-22-093), we postulate that succinate elevation in periodontitis induces
neurodegeneration directly via SUCNR1 activation in microglial cells, and indirectly via
systemic inflammation and dysbiosis. In Aim 1 we will reveal how SUCNR1 activation in microglia
modulates neuroinflammation in vitro and in vivo. Microglia are crucial for the homeostasis within the
brain and our preliminary data showed that the stimulation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway
and IL-1β expression by succinate in microglia is SUCNR1-dependent. We will study the mechanism of
microglial succinate/SUCNR1 signaling on neuroinflammation in primary microglia, littermate control
(Ctrl) and microglial-specific SUCNR1 deficient (mKO) mice. In aim 2 we will assess the impact of
targeting SUCNR1 on cognition impairment with chronic periodontitis. We will target SUCNR1 using
mKO mice in Exp. 1 in which 20-month-old, both genders of littermate ctrl and mKO mice will be
assigned randomly to have sham or chronic periodontitis for 4 months before cognition tests and
sample collections. In Exp. 2 we will employ 5xFAD mice with periodontitis to determine if blocking
SUCNR1 by an antagonist will alleviate periodontal bone loss, neuroinflammation and recognition
deficits. The SUCNR1 antagonist treated mice and their age and gender-matched, sham/veh treated
WT, and 5xFAD mice will be assessed longitudinally at 4-, 7-, and 12-month-old for neuroinflammation
and cognition impairment. The proposed research will discover a novel mechanism of succinate
signaling in periodontitis and AD nexus and provide a new therapeutic target for AD."

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most frequent adverse outcome among infants born at <30 weeks
gestation and is associated with adverse respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Early BPD includes a
component of alveolar and interstitial edema resulting in reduced lung compliance. Some evidence suggests
that the use of loop diuretics, such as furosemide, in preterm infants > 3 weeks of age improves pulmonary
mechanics and oxygenation after 1 week of treatment; however, the evidence is weak because most studies
were not conducted in the current treatment era characterized by widespread surfactant and antenatal
corticosteroid use and data focuses mainly on short-term outcomes. Furthermore, diuretics have a range of
side effects including electrolyte abnormalities, osteopenia, potential ototoxicity, and nephrocalcinosis. Despite
weak evidence for their effectiveness and concerns over safety, diuretics are commonly used. There is a need
to strengthen the evidence-base regarding diuretic use in BPD with data that answers the current,
relevant clinical questions—whether an individual patient in the current treatment era will derive short-
term benefits from the treatment and whether the treatment is safe and effective in the long-term. We
designed a clinical trial that addresses prevailing clinical attitudes that some infants clinically benefit or are
“responders” by including a run-in period that examines individual patient short-term response using an
innovative N-of-1 trial design while also answering questions about the longer-term efficacy and safety of
chronic diuretic use by following the run-in N-of-1 trial with a placebo-controlled, parallel group randomized
controlled trial (RCT) of chronic diuretics among responders. The objective of this R34 application is to obtain
necessary and sufficient information to enable final decisions about the approach of the larger clinical trial
through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Estimate the number of responder infants available to enter the
parallel group RCT phase of the trial after the N-of-1 trial run-in period and Aim 2: Evaluate provider and
parent willingness to randomize responders to assess the potential dropout rate between run-in and
randomization. Accomplishing these aims is particularly important because the use of a formal N-of-1 trial
design as a run-in to a parallel group RCT is a unique and cutting-edge approach. Upon completion of these
aims, this pilot will provide a detailed understanding of the extent to which participants are able to complete the
N-of-1 trial and it will supply data on the percent of patients identified as “responders.” This will enable a more
accurate assessment of the available sample size entering the parallel group RCT phase of the trial. The pilot
will also provide the data necessary to determine the expected dropout rate between the run-in and parallel
group RCT phases due to reluctance to randomize a “responder” to furosemide or placebo. Together this
information will enable informed decisions about the larger trial sample size and the design of the N-of-1 run-in
phase, and it will be of value for others planning studies of diuretics and BPD management strategies."

The central tenet of this grant application contains two interdependent components 1) how does the structure
determine the function of K+-channels? and how does the cell membrane phospholipid composition
regulate their structure-function correlations? Our work deal with these two fundamental questions, which
encompasses three aspects of ion channel physiology: 1) Which are the structural changes underlying K+-
channel gating, permeation, and selectivity? 2) How does a bidirectional allosteric coupling between the
activation gate (AG) and the selectivity filter (SF) control K+-channels function? and 3) How does the cell
membrane lipid composition regulate K+-channels behavior? Understanding at the atomic level how K+-
channels work will assist during the discovery of novel therapeutic drugs. We will use several
methodological advancements developed by us during the last 10 years of continuous funding from the NIH.
These achievements are: 1) the elucidation of an atomic resolution gating cycle of a K+-channel 2) the
engineering of a disulfide bridged locked open KcsA scaffold that produces atomic resolution diffracting crystals
and allow us to characterize its function by electrophysiology at pH 7.0 (a physiologically relevant pH) 3) the
measuring of the alkali metal ions binding affinity by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry of the whole selectivity filter
of a K+-channel in the open conformation and/or of individual ion binding sites 4) the discovery of a novel
mechanism of KcsA activation by reducing the thickness of the cell membrane and 5) the development of a
new methodology for the overexpression of properly folded and functional Human K+-channels of
Biomedical Importance in E. coli cells. Our work using KcsA as a structural surrogate is foundational of our
current understanding of K+-channel function. Now we are expanding into human K+-channels by developing a
groundbreaking new methodology for the overexpression of properly folded and functional human Kv-channels
in E. coli cells, which eliminates the otherwise time consuming and outrageously expensive use of eukaryotic
cells. We will develop an integrative understanding of how the structure of ion channels change its conformation
to regulate their function within an energetic landscape determined by the lipid composition of the cell membrane.
We aim to determine the structural changes underlying ion permeation, ion selectivity and C-type inactivation
gating and their interdependence with the lipid bilayer composition of the cell membrane in a bacterial channel
and in two human Kv-channels of Biomedical Relevance. Finally, we will produce a conceptual framework about
how the allosteric coupling between a K+-channel’s selectivity filter and its activation gate define ion channel
function and how is modulated by subunit cooperativity and the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane.
The completion of this grant application will produce invaluable information to assist in the smart design of safer
therapeutic drugs."
10841616,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The distinctive effects of combined nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) and cannabis use on
neuromaturational brain changes is unknown despite preclinical evidence of a functional interaction between
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nicotine in the brain that may enhance susceptibility to the
development of problematic substance use patterns and addiction severity symptoms. As cannabis becomes
more socially accepted and accessible and nicotine delivery methods become more advanced and widespread
among emerging adults, the neurobiological effects of co-use of these two substances during young adulthood
must be better understood.
The primary objective of the proposed prospective research is to recruit a sample of emerging adults (N=200)
ages 18-19 at enrollment for three in-person assessments over three years, and a follow-up behavioral
interview four years post-enrollment. At enrollment, participants will report either concurrent and simultaneous
cannabis and NTP co-use, cannabis use only, NTP use only, and minimal to no use of either substance to
compare how cannabis and nicotine use trajectories influence: (1) structural, vascular, and functional brain
integrity, (2) neurocognition, (3) stress, emotional distress, and substance use, and (4) circulating
endocannabinoid concentrations in blood serum. The study will use cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques
(restriction spectrum imaging, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, and high-resolution
magnetoencephalography), cognitive testing, bioassays, and detailed mental health assessments at all in-
person visits for a more precise understanding of the unique and combined effects of cannabis and NTP use
on neural health, behavior, and the endocannabinoid system from ages 18-25 years-old.
Young adults are one of our most vulnerable populations (e.g., high peak substance use rates, high
vulnerability for addiction, high susceptibility to peer use attitudes and perceptions). As a result, they are
specifically targeted by the cannabis and tobacco industry, particularly as the regulatory environment continues
to become increasingly permissive for cannabis products. Yet, there is a remarkable paucity of research
examining co-use of these two commonly used substances on neural health and neurocognitive functioning in
emerging adults. The proposed research will lead to a greater understanding of the unique and combined
effects of these substances on protracted brain development and risk for substance use disorders, which will
guide neuroscience-informed prevention and intervention programs, public health messages, and public policy."

Neighborhood disadvantage is a potent predictor of youth risk-taking and aggressive antisocial
behaviors (ASB). This association with youth ASB emerges early in life and increases over time.
Understanding how neighborhood disadvantage leads to youth ASB thus constitutes a critical public
health need. To date, however, the biological mechanism(s) through which disadvantage influences
youth ASB remain unclear. The proposed R01 will explore methylation as a key biological pathway
underlying the association between neighborhood disadvantage and youth ASB. We specifically
postulate that neighborhood disadvantage and its social and physical `active ingredients' (e.g., harsh
parenting, exposure to community violence, and toxicant exposure) will predict youth ASB via
methylomic alterations, and that these associations will persist over any genetic confounds. To
examine this possibility, we will generate methylation data from blood and/or saliva at four
assessment waves (neonatal, middle childhood, and early and mid-adolescence) in a discovery
sample of 500 adolescent twin pairs (1,000 twins) residing in modestly-to-severely disadvantaged
neighborhoods. We then propose to replicate the phenotypic associations in an independent sample
of 237 singleton youth living in poverty with methylation data from blood and/or saliva at three
assessment waves (neonatal, middle childhood, and mid-adolescence). As our final step, we will
leverage the focus on twin pairs in our Discovery twin sample to evaluate whether the replicated
methylomic associations are environmental and/or genetic in origin. In short, the proposed R01 will
not only identify neighborhood-induced methylomic alterations in two independent samples of
impoverished youth, but will also illuminate the environmental and/or genetic etiology of those
replicated alterations. In this way, we will move the field of social and environmental epigenetics
forward in several areas."
10919756,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cell cycle is tightly controlled by an intricate sequence of events where both gene expression and
protein degradation are under intense regulation. When the cell cycle is dysregulated, uncontrolled division
ensues–a hallmark of cancer. Therefore, cell cycle checkpoints, such as the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC), ensure faithful chromosome segregation and produce healthy daughter cells. During an active
checkpoint, transcription is reduced and the primary ubiquitin ligase of mitosis, the Anaphase-Promoting
Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C), is inhibited by the 4-subunit Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC). Once the
chromosomes are ready and the checkpoint is satisfied, the APC/C is freed from MCC inhibition through
conformational rearrangements that permit MCC ubiquitination. The APC/C targets several well-established
cell cycle regulators (e.g., Cyclin B and Securin) and chromatin regulators, including the chromatin building
blocks–nucleosomes, for destruction, coupling mitotic exit and transcription. The APC/C-dependent
progression through mitosis is incredibly complicated as it requires the participation of dozens of proteins,
including activators, inhibitors, kinases, AAA-ATPases, and substrates. How all this regulation is successfully
integrated on a single APC/C scaffold is unclear but highly significant because it is at the intersection of both
protein degradation and gene expression for G1 phase. By reconstituting these processes in vitro with
innovative techniques, such as time-resolved cryo-EM and mass photometry, we can better understand how
polyubiquitination occurs, how specific cell cycle effectors influence the conformational states of MCC-bound
APC/C, and how the nucleosome is targeted by the APC/C. The information gained from these studies will lead
to an unprecedented understanding of the SAC and coordinated gene expression, which is at the heart of
development, cell biology, and countless disease processes, including cancer."
10892028,"Project Summary
 The important challenge this project addresses is to gain a mechanistic understanding of regulatory
elements that tightly control the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular signaling pathways. To meet
this challenge, we combine computational approaches, including mathematical modeling and image
analysis, with experiments performed at the single cell level. All cells must sense and respond to
changes in their environment. Environmental cues such as hormones, nutrients or physical stresses are
detected by receptors on the cell surface. This information is than processed and transmitted to
appropriate regions of the cell by intracellular signaling pathways. The proper response to a stimulus
often requires cells to change shape or move. Therefore, signaling pathways must coordinate the
dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in both space and time. This task is accomplished through the use
of feedback and feedforward loops acting over multiple temporal and spatial scales. Because these
regulatory loops make signaling pathways inherently nonlinear, mathematical modeling is required to
understand the emergent properties of these systems. We have identified three cellular processes that
lend themselves to systems-level analysis and form the basis for our studies over the next five years: 1)
directed growth during mating and budding in the yeast S. cerevisiae and related fungi, 2)
phagocytosis, the process through which cells sense and ingest bacteria and other objects, and 3)
collective migration in which a group of cells move as a single unit. These projects represent the
continuation of established collaborations and exciting new directions for my lab. We will continue our
collaboration with the lab of Dr. Daniel Lew (Duke, Pharmacology and Cancer Biology) to understand
the mechanisms that underlie polarity establishment and gradient sensing in S. cerevisiae. In a new
collaboration with Dr, Amy Gladfelter (UNC, Biology), we will investigate if similar mechanisms play a
role in the establishment of multiple polarity sites by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans. We also will
continue our long-standing collaboration with the lab of Dr. Klaus Hahn (UNC, Pharmacology) to
investigate the mechanisms that underlie spatial patterning during phagocytosis. Finally, we have
recently established a new collaboration with Dr. Scott Magness (UNC, BME) to investigate epithelial
polarization during collective migration. The goal of our investigations is to generate truly predictive
models of in vivo cellular processes that ultimately provide insights into the etiology and treatment of
human diseases."
10908266,"Project Summary
 Ribosomes are responsible for the rapid and accurate production of all proteins in cells in all forms of
life on earth. The ability of these molecular machines to carry out faithful translation depends on their complex
structure that allows dynamic interaction with ligands. The mature ribosome in eukaryotic cells is composed of
two parts, the large 60S subunit that synthesizes all the proteins in a cell and the small 40S subunit that
decodes mRNA. The production of a eukaryotic ribosome involves over 200 accessory factors which
orchestrate the intricate processing and folding of the ribosomal RNA and assembly of the ribosomal proteins.
Considering the complexity of ribosome structure and function and its critical role in decoding our genetic
information, ensuring their correct assembly is a necessary but daunting task for cells. Lately, considerable
interest has been focused on mechanisms of quality control in the ribosome biogenesis pathway. This proposal
focuses on two distinct topics within ribosome assembly; (1) the mechanisms for assessing the structural and
functional integrity of the newly assembled 60S subunit and (2) the transition from the early 90S pre-ribosomal
precursor to the pre-40S precursor.
 With respect to assessment of structural and functional integrity, this proposal addresses three related
questions: I. How are newly minted subunits assessed for function? II. What is the fate of defective subunits? III.
What is the consequence of licensing defective ribosomes? In humans, defects in these processes lead to
various diseases, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.
 Assembly of the small ribosomal subunit involves stepwise cotranscriptional assembly of the 90S
particle, a large protein-RNA complex, scaffolded on U3-snoRNA. However, the presence of U3 is mutually
incompatible with the final folded structure of small subunit RNA and must be removed once transcription of
the RNA is complete and the 90S particle has fully assembled. The transition from the 90S to pre-40S is poorly
understood. We propose that the displacement of U3 by the RNA helicase Dhr1 is a primary event that drives
the transition of the 90S into the pre-40S particle. We will determine how the activity of Dhr1 is regulated to
ensure the timely release of U3."
10907412,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically
relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic
effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last 15 years, however,
the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genomic technologies, and parallel advances
in human genetics has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs.
Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP),
whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains,
with the goal of efﬁciently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP),
whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study
population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be inﬁnitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental
genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been
implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, ﬂies, and rodents.
 The proposed program of research focuses primarily on the development of statistical and computational
tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs, and MP-GRPs, and secondarily on
how those tools can be applied to genetically varying populations more broadly, including humans. Five main
research themes are considered:
 1) How to maximally exploit GRPs for studying genetic effects on treatment-response phenotypes, such as
adverse reactions to drug therapy, pathogenesis in response to viral infection, or metabolic response to diet.
Directions considered include new ways to a) statistically deconfound genetic effects on treatment response
from those on baseline outcomes, b) detect genetic effects that are distributional or non-linear in nature.
 2) How to use multiple studies on related GRPs to a) assess replicability and reproducibility of those re-
sources, and b) combine analyses for greater power.
 3) How to accommodate and exploit genetic- and non-genetically-driven differences in residual phenotypic
variance in QTL mapping and genomic analyses.
 4) How to maximally exploit QTL mapping based on haplotypes, both in cases where haplotypes are inferred
based on descent and where they are assigned as pseudo-haplotypes through empirical clustering procedures.
 5) How methods for multi-omic causal can exploit haplotype- and pseudo-haplotyped-based genetic anchors.
 Progress on these fronts will increase the power, value, and scope of studies on genetically varying model
organism populations as well as on genetically varying populations more broadly."

 This application responds to PAR-20-094 and seeks renewed R25 support for MH101072, UCSD’s “Psych-
iatry Residency Research Track” (RRT) to stimulate academic psychiatrists to conduct research into the
causes and treatments of mental illness. This R25, first funded in 2013, was renewed in 2018 with a “10”
priority score. In FY 6-9, 100% of the Residents who had “matched” into this RRT in FY1-5 graduated into
“triple threat” positions: 6 are Faculty (5 with Career Development Awards plus significant private funding) and
one is a PGY5 Fellow. Two “internal” trainees joined the RRT mid-Residency. Four of 9 RRT graduates to-date
are from NIH-defined underrepresented groups. A Psychiatry Summer Research Fellowship (SPRF) for URM
Medical Students, funded by this R25, successfully trained future URM Academic Psychiatrists. This renewal
application builds on the strengths of FY1-9 and the scientific expertise of UCSD faculty to sustain an RRT that
is both substantive and innovative. In FY11-15, MH101072 will achieve the goals of the NIMH Council report,
“Investing in the Future,” and of this FOA by expanding the pool of diverse Psychiatric researchers - a key step
towards improving treatment and outcome for mental disorders. This application will achieve 2 Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. To recruit and educate the highest caliber future psychiatric researchers. Trainees complete a
4-year RRT; protected research time rises from 17% (PGY2) to 40% (PGY3) to 70% (PGY4), though core
programs effectively extend these percentages. PGY3-4 seminars provide solid grounding in research design,
data analysis, manuscript preparation and responsible conduct of research. Trainees learn academic survival
skills and receive thoughtful supervision and personalized career mentorship. The core curriculum, detailed in
this application, strengthens and sustains trainees' career connection with mental health research and the core
missions of the NIMH. In FY11-15, innovative changes will solidify trainee research funding, build vertical
cohesiveness across the RRT and engage RRT graduates in early career mentorship activities.
 Aim 2. To increase the number of research psychiatrists from underrepresented backgrounds.
Diversity among RRT graduates grew from 0% in the 10 years prior to this R25, to 44.4% in the past cycle;
diversity recruitment will expand in FY11-15. The SPRF for URM medical students added 6 URM trainees to
Psychiatry Residencies, including 2 to RRT’s; 2 more SPRF trainees still in med school are headed into
Psychiatry. This renewal builds on this success by doubling the size of our SPRF to 4 trainees per Summer.
 With renewed support, MH101072 will admit 10 new RRT trainees, graduate 9 trainees (5 current + 4 new),
leaving 8 trainees “in the pipeline” to complete their training via renewed R25 or DoP support. This will bring
the total yield of MH101072 (FY1-15) to 30 RRT graduates, in addition to 36 URM Summer Fellows. This RRT
will provide individualized oversight of each trainee in an innovative format that will accelerate their paths
towards faculty positions and career research funding and thereby achieve the goals of this NIMH program."

evolution in real time. The latter include (i) experimental evolution in yeast (adaptation by de novo mutation in
well-mixed clonal system), (ii) adaptation on seasonal and ecological time-scales in Drosophila (adaptation from
standing variation in a obligately sexual organism), and (iii) tumor initiation, growth, and evolution in experimental
mouse model of lung cancer (engineered de novo and spontaneous alterations in a spatially constrained
context). These projects utilize a diversity of systems, high throughput and well-powered experimental
modalities, and sophisticated and varied analytic frameworks, but they all focus on the overarching need to
understand the dynamics of rapid adaptation. Ultimately, we aim to construct a theory of evolutionary adaptation
that can naturally account for the patterns of evolution established over long periods of time, which are evident
in genomic data, as well as the short-term dynamics of adaptation directly observable in short-term experimental
studies of evolution."

Over the past 10 years, our research program has aimed at discovering molecular mechanisms that control
metabolic adaptation in response to nutrient availability, cellular differentiation, and oxidative stress through
genomic reprogramming. With NIGMS support, we have made significant contributions to identifying
mechanisms responsible for the coordinated regulation of gene transcription and translation during the
Mitochondrial Stress Response (MSR). Our work has identified a key role for non-degradative ubiquitination in
both processes, showing that the regulated shuttling of GPS2 – an endogenous inhibitor of K63 ubiquitination –
between mitochondria and nucleus is an essential strategy for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. As a
complement to these mechanistic studies, we also investigated – in projects supported by NIDDK and the
Department of Defense – the physiological relevance and translational potential GPS2-mediated regulation of
ubiquitin signaling in breast cancer and obesity-associated disorders. Together, these studies have revealed the
importance of GPS2-mediated restriction of K63Ub signaling in promoting metabolic adaptation and
mitochondria remodeling during stress and cellular differentiation. This large body of work highlights our
expertise in the field and our unique position to further investigate the crosstalk between this newly identified
pathway and other PTMs involved in regulating mitochondrial function. In particular, we will focus our future
studies on the crosstalk between ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation. These PTMs work in tandem in the
regulation of nuclear genome stability, innate immunity and stress-induced translational regulation. However,
their relationship in regulating mitochondrial function has not yet been investigated. In fact, although the presence
of ADP-ribosylation activity in mitochondria was known for decades, the identity of the mitochondrial ART
enzyme/s has been elusive, hindering more detailed studies on the role and regulation of mitochondrial proteins
through ADP-ribosylation. As we recently identified NEURL4 as a mitochondria-dedicated ADP-ribosyl
transferase under the regulation of stress-induced and GPS2-mediated reprogramming, we are now in the
position of carrying those studies. We propose a research plan spanning two major areas:1) Investigating the
spatial and functional regulation of mitochondria retrograde signaling in response to mitochondrial stress and 2)
Exploring the crosstalk between ubiquitination and ADP-ribosylation in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis.
Our research plan addresses three key problems: i) the spatial regulation of mitochondria retrograde signaling;
ii) the functional contribution of mitochondria retrograde signaling to the regulation of ADP-ribosylation and
ubiquitination across subcellular compartments; iii) the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated
regulation of ADP-ribosylation/ ubiquitination. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to a better
understanding of the mechanisms regulating mitochondria homeostasis through post-translational modifications
and possibly reveal regulatory strategies to be targeted for therapeutic purposes."

 Circadian (daily) rhythms are a crucial component of human health that regulates sleep, alertness,
homeostasis, cellular signaling, and many other biological processes. The fascination of this phenomenon is to
explain how a biochemical mechanism (i) can robustly sustain a long period (~24 h) oscillation whose
frequency keeps time so precisely, and (ii) enhance fitness in the natural environment. These questions remain
critically important unanswered issues in the circadian rhythms field. For example, the adaptive value is not
clear for the most obvious circadian characteristic–a robust self-sustained oscillation in constant conditions. If
“anticipation” of future temporal events (e.g., dawn, dusk, etc.) is the goal of circadian timekeepers, why is a
temperature-compensated “hourglass timer” that is initiated by dawn or dusk not sufficient? And yet evolution
ubiquitously selected an oscillator that sustains itself in non-natural continuous conditions as the timekeeper for
regulating daily processes, and this characteristic forms a core defining property of circadian rhythms. The
overall goal of this project is to determine which characteristics of rhythmic environments provide selective
pressures that coordinate cellular organization of gene expression and information processing to promote
properties of circadian timekeeping. Identifying the selective pressures & evolutionary steps that can lead to
biological timekeeping will enable a more profound understanding of circadian mechanisms and signaling so
that they might be reinforced to aid human health and performance.
 The unique characteristics of model systems will be harnessed to attain the goal of this project by a
multifaceted approach. First, in free-living organisms, the circadian regulation of seasonal responses and
circadian interactions within communities of cells will be investigated to determine why sustained oscillators are
necessarily adaptive. Second, the temporal dimensions of host/microbiome relations will be manipulated to
ascertain if the gut microbiome is under active selection for timekeeping ability. Finally, a novel experimental
evolution approach will identify which environmental pressures can be selective for circadian clocks.
 The answers to these questions will help us to better understand general principles of fundamental
circadian organization and rhythmic regulation of cellular physiology; this understanding can help us to better
design therapies for disorders in which circadian clocks are implicated."
10841708,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Our understanding of the role of ocular biomechanical properties, such as elasticity and viscosity, is incomplete
as there are no clinical methods for their in vivo clinical measurement. We propose to develop and refine a
novel noninvasive ultrasound vibro-elastography (USVE) technique to measure viscoelastic properties of
ocular tissues, and use the technique to assess two diseases, glaucoma and papilledema. We recently
completed a R21 grant, evaluating USVE for assessing glaucoma. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of
blindness in the US and worldwide, and the only available treatment is reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP).
Our pilot study found significant differences in wave speed in the posterior sclera between glaucomatous and
normal eyes. In another pilot project, we evaluated USVE in papilledema patients. Papilledema is optic nerve
swelling, caused by increased intracranial pressure, and can cause significant vision loss. Papilledema from
idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is typically bilateral and symmetric but can sometimes be asymmetric
and even unilateral. We found that wave speeds in the posterior sclera of IIH patients were significantly higher
than healthy subjects. In addition, wave speeds in patients with unilateral papilledema were significantly higher
in affected eyes, compared with unaffected contralateral eyes. Both diseases depend on the biomechanics of
ocular tissues including the posterior sclera surrounding the optic nerve head. However, they are on opposite
ends of the spectrum where the deformation of the lamina cribrosa is back bowing in glaucoma and forward
bowing in papilledema. Studying both diseases will help us to better understand the role of ocular tissue
properties in disease risk and development, and the basic viscoelastic characteristics of the eye. In Aim 1, we
will develop and refine USVE for measuring ocular viscoelastic properties. We will study various wave models
in ocular tissues and develop advanced viscoelastic models to analyze ocular tissue’s elasticity and viscosity
based on the wave speed dispersion measurements. In Aim 2, we will develop and refine USVE for assessing
50 patients with normal tension glaucoma (NTG) – glaucoma occurring at normal intraocular pressure – and 50
healthy control subjects. Since ocular biomechanical properties will be related to IOP, recruitment of NTG
patients will allow comparison with IOP matched controls. In Aim 3, we will develop and refine USVE for
assessing patients with papilledema. We will enroll a large cohort of 50 patients with papilledema from IIH and
compare them with 50 age- and gender- matched healthy control subjects. We will study the changes of USVE
measurements at baseline and after resolution of papilledema after treatment. Successful accomplishment of
this project will provide fundamental knowledge about the role of ocular tissue biomechanical properties in
glaucoma and papilledema. USVE may have the ability to stratify the risk of glaucomatous damage and the
propensity toward the development of papilledema and vision loss, and identify novel targets for therapy."

Traditionally, studies of antibiotic resistance have focused on evolutionary and molecular
mechanisms of resistance. However, many of our best antibiotics target the bacterial cell envelope,
which is a mechanically robust, structural exoskeleton for the cell. Ultimately, these antibiotics cause
cell death by weakening the envelope enough to cause explosion of the cell by the large, hydrostatic
pressure within it. Despite the central mechanical importance of the cell envelope, we have little
understanding of which molecules and moieties within it are critical for its load-bearing capacity.
Addressing this question would transform our understanding of antibiotic resistance. A primary
reason for this gap in our knowledge is the formidable challenge of applying mechanical forces to
single bacterial cells while monitoring their physiology. The proposed research will address this
obstacle by applying innovative, highly precise, high-throughput microfluidics and microscopy-based
assays to measure the mechanical properties of two of the major cell envelope components in
bacteria, the outer membrane and the cell wall. These assays will be combined with molecular and
cell biological techniques, and biophysical theory, to explore an emerging paradigm within
microbiology: that bacteria control antibiotic resistance by adaptively tuning the mechanical properties
of their cell envelope. First, building on the recent landmark finding that the outer membrane confers
antibiotic resistance to bacteria because of its mechanical strength, the dependence of outer
membrane stiffness and mechanical antibiotic resistance on the fine-scale biochemical composition of
the outer membrane will be systematically measured. Next, the mechanism of outer membrane
vesiculation (a process underlying antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis) will be investigated by
combining a theoretical mechanical model of vesiculation with novel microscopy assays to quantify
vesiculation dynamics, while genetically tuning protein-protein interactions between the cell wall and
outer membrane. Finally, the scope of these studies will be extended to Gram-positive bacteria by
determining the dependence of antibiotic resistance on cell wall stiffness in these species, specifically
focusing on the mechanical contributions of teichoic acids to resistance. Together, these studies will
transform our understanding of bacterial pathogen survival and growth, and point to fresh strategies
to circumvent antibiotic resistance and treat bacterial infections."

During the current funding period, this program has continued its outstanding record of educating scholars
as independent investigators and leaders in drug-abuse research. Since the submission of our last
competitive application in 2015, competition for support from this program has been robust, and all slots
have been filled. Twenty-five pre-doctoral and 14 post-doctoral trainees have received support from the
grant, these trainees have published 149 papers, and 10 pre-doctoral and 5 post-doctoral trainees have
earned individual NIH fellowships. Looking forward, we are poised to continue this record of success. We
have recruited 2 new drug-abuse faculty in pharmacology as well as 5 new faculty members with relevant
skills and interests from other departments. Moreover, recognizing the many strengths of the Department
of Pharmacology and Toxicology, the dean has authorized the recruitment of up to 10 additional well-
established faculty to join our team of 22 drug-abuse faculty. Additionally, a large increase in the number
of clinical faculty in recent years justifies our request to increase the number of both pre and post-doctoral
trainees by 2. Further support for this requested increase comes from the fact that there are more than 90
research grants from NIDA at this institution, and this is the only institutional training grant. Our preceptors
provide trainees with “cutting edge” expertise in molecular, cellular, behavioral, clinical, and translational
research. The program continues to emphasize pharmacology, but it has truly developed into a university-
wide program open to trainees from all schools and incorporating multiple disciplines. The broad academic
scope of the program is accomplished through rigorous core courses and a wide variety of advanced
electives, a high level of collaboration among mentors to include reciprocal service on thesis committees,
and multiple excellent seminar series. Additional initiatives are proposed to increase the diversity of the
trainees and enhance mentor training. These academic opportunities complement a research
infrastructure supported by a NIDA P30 grant that provides for the development of genetically altered
animals, sophisticated bioanalytical technology, and expertise in advanced gastrointestinal and
neuropharmacology research methodologies. Academic and research training is further supplemented by
guidance on teaching, professional development for a career in drug-abuse science, and all aspects of
becoming a productive, independent researcher. Our goal is to build on the program’s established record
of success by continuing to provide a rigorous and supportive atmosphere for training leading scholars in
the drug-abuse field for the future."

Under-utilization of health care during the critical pre- and perinatal periods is believed to play an important
role in explaining poor child health outcomes in developing countries. Demand-side innovations, often
involving the use of monetary incentives, have been shown to induce greater uptake of health services,
but a key unanswered question has been whether they lead to improvements in health. In response to this
evidence gap we conducted one of the first ever large-scale cluster randomized trials of conditional
incentives. More than 10,000 pregnant women across more than 2,300 census enumeration areas in
Nigeria participated in this trial. In clusters randomly assigned to the intervention, pregnant women were
offered cash payments of $14 payable if they attended at least three prenatal visits, delivered in a health
facility, and attended one postnatal visit. In control clusters, pregnant women received a small gift worth
$0.43 for participation. We found that in the intervention arm utilization of pre- and perinatal care more
than doubled and women received better quality care, culminating in a significant reduction in fetal losses
and stillbirths, and an overall decrease in child mortality. In this follow-on R01 we propose to return to the
study communities approximately 5 years after the RCT. We have three main objectives: first, we want to
examine whether the incentives had long run effects on maternal behavior, second, we want to measure
long run effects on child health, and finally we want to examine whether the incentives generated
community spillovers."

Chronic infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) may contribute to both cognitive and physical function decline in
older adults and have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), vascular dementia,
and frailty. Due to immune senescence and immune suppression, older Kidney Transplant (KT) recipients ≥50
years, are at especially high risk of early and frequent reactivations of latent CMV and may fail to reconstitute
CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMV-CMI), leading to high rates of CMV disease. This research will
investigate for the first time the role of CMV and CMV-CMI reconstitution in cognitive and physical functional
decline in KT recipients. This research is relevant to the NIA mission because it will advance the understanding
of the critical mechanisms driving CMV-related aging in older adults by studying the impact of CMV on decline
in cognitive and physical function, AD, and frailty.
 This proposal's central hypothesis is that inflammation secondary to CMV replication may explain the
mechanism by which CMV may contribute to cognitive and physical function decline, AD, and progression of
frailty. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: 1) To quantify the association of CMV
serostatus with trajectories of cognition and physical function in an existing Functional Assessment of Renal
Disease (FAIR) cohort of older KT recipients; 2) To assess the relationship of CMV-CMI reconstitution with
trajectories of cognitive and physical function and frailty in a newly established Colorado cohort of CMV+ older
KT recipients; 3) To investigate the relationship of inflammatory markers with trajectories of cognition and
physical function among CMV+ and CMV- KT recipients at 1-year post-KT in Colorado cohort.
 This approach is innovative because it: 1) allows the first investigation of the relationship of CMV, with
the trajectories of cognitive and physical function among older KT recipients, and 2) may identify the role of
CMV-CMI and inflammation driving the relationship of CMV with cognitive and physical function decline. This
project is significant because it has the potential to improve health outcomes for older KT recipients.

Background: The increasing incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be mitigated by
successful prevention with behavioral changes or pharmacotherapy in individuals that are at high risk.
Identifying a specific individual’s risk for diabetes and which preventive treatment will be most effective,
however, remains a clinical dilemma. Metabolite biomarkers represent a novel approach to addressing these
clinical challenges and may also reveal mechanisms of disease development. This five-year mentored career
development proposal details a translational research training program in biomarker discovery and clinical
study implementation with a goal of identifying metabolite predictors of diabetes and preventive treatment
effect. Candidate: The applicant is a recently appointed Endocrinology faculty member at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center with a long-term goal to become a physician-scientist who investigates metabolic
pathways involved in T2D development and progression. She has 2.5 years of experience in molecular
profiling in large human studies and the outlined proposal builds on this background to provide new domains of
expertise including prediction modeling, genetics, and clinical study design. Training: The applicant’s
development will occur through a blend of laboratory training, didactic courses (including an ongoing MPH),
and scientific conferences. The candidate’s mentor is a recognized leader in molecular profiling, integrative
“omics”, and cardiometabolic diseases. Her co-mentor is a leader in T2D genetics, and the members of her
advisory committee have a distinguished mentoring record and vast expertise in T2D, non-targeted
metabolomics, statistical modeling, and clinical trials. Research: Recently, the applicant identified unique
metabolite profiles associated with T2D in a large, randomized control trial that compared lifestyle changes and
metformin therapy for T2D prevention in individuals with impaired glucose regulation. These associations,
including specific phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol esters, remained after adjustments for traditional
clinical risk factors suggesting they could serve as predictors of T2D. Furthermore, these metabolites were
associated with different rates of T2D progression after lifestyle or metformin treatment and may help guide
T2D prevention decisions. The applicant proposes to further extend these findings by (Aim 1) creating
metabolite multi-marker prediction models to assess the ability of these metabolites to prospectively predict
diabetes development, (Aim 2A) integrate these findings with genetics to uncover metabolic pathways that
underly these associations and if they cause diabetes, (Aim 2B) leverage genetics to also identify completely
novel circulating small molecules associated with T2D, and (Aim 3) conduct a small prospective cohort study to
externally validate these metabolites as predictive biomarkers in a real-world clinical setting. This work will lay
the foundation for an NIH R01 application for a clinical trial to assess the predictive utility of metabolite
biomarkers for diabetes prevention and transition the candidate to research independence."
10818402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
related death among US men. The best current estimate of PCa aggressiveness is the Gleason score obtained
from core biopsy. The most common biopsy method is freehand transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided. Since
ultrasound only rarely identifies PCa visually, systematic biopsy (SB) intends to sample the prostate evenly. But
freehand SB is highly inconsistent, subjective, and results in uneven sampling, leaving large regions of the
prostate unsampled, which can lead to under-sampling of clinically significant cancer and under-staging of PCa
diagnosis at biopsy.
The current trend in prostate biopsy is directed towards a targeted biopsy (TB) approach guided by
multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI). Several advanced biopsy devices are available and
register (fuse) the mpMRI to interventional ultrasound. TB yield a higher significant PCa detection rate than SB.
But SB on patients with no mpMRI findings found many men to harbor PCa, so SB is currently performed in addition
to TB. However, SB use the same 12-core extended sextant plan for all patients regardless of their gland shape.
Moreover, significant variability exists among urologists at freehand biopsy, even with the fusion devices.
Our team has developed and tested the feasibility of a novel robotic device that takes SB from a one-
size-fits-all to a patient-optimized plan, and from a freehand to a hands-free skill-independent robot-
assisted procedure. No similar devices currently exist. This technology consists of a robotic ultrasound probe
manipulator and software for ultrasound processing, robot control, fusion TB, and optimized SB planning. Our
novel SB planning software optimizes the biopsy core locations for each patient to maximize the likelihood
of detecting clinically significant PCa and taking into account mpMRI visible lesions, if available.
The robotic device was cleared for clinical trials by the Food and Drug Administration and our Institutional Review
Board approved the study. A Phase 0, Safety and Feasibility clinical trial was successfully completed. We
propose a Phase I clinical trial to gain early evidence on the effectiveness of personalized biopsy planning and
precision biopsy to improve the detection rate of clinically significant PCa in a randomized clinical trial versus
one of the most common fusion biopsy devices on the market.
The specific aims of the 5-year project are: A1) Perform randomized clinical trial of robot vs. the fusion device.
Include patients with mpMRI exams. On each arm, perform SB on PI-RADS≤2 and TB+SB on PI-RADS≥3
patients; A2) Record pathology from subset of patients of A1 who proceed to radical prostatectomy, and compare
biopsy to prostatectomy results on both arms; A3) Offline, simulate SB alone plans for patients who undergo
SB+TB and determine if SB cores could overlap TB locations;"

 Mammography screening may decrease breast cancer mortality and morbidity but the potential benefits
are often delayed for many years while significant harms can occur in the short term. While breast cancer
incidence increases with age, older women are also at higher risks for screening-related harms and burdens
compared to younger women. The harms of routine screening outweigh the benefits among older women with
limited life expectancies, but many of these women continue to be screened, highlighting the need for
interventions to promote appropriate screening cessation in order to reduce over-screening in older women.
Our prior research suggests that older adults are willing to stop routine cancer screening when recommended
by their clinicians. We also found that clinicians are increasingly willing to recommend that older patients forgo
screening when harms outweigh the benefits. However, patients at times receive contradictory messages from
their family, friends, or the news media which weaken the impact of the clinicians' recommendations and
contribute to over-screening.
 This project aims to examine how messages from clinicians, family and friends, and media, separately
and together, impact breast cancer screening intentions among older women, with the goal of identifying
messaging strategies that most effectively reduce breast cancer over-screening. We seek to accomplish this
goal through 3 aims. We will first establish which messages intended to reduce breast cancer over-screening
are considered most credible in a national online survey of 600 older women (Aim 1). Then, we will conduct a
two-wave online survey experiment with 3,000 older women to examine the combined effects of consistent and
conflicting messages from different sources—including clinicians, social relationships, and the news media —
on breast cancer screening beliefs, attitudes, and intentions over time (Aim 2). Lastly, we will conduct focus
groups with multi-disciplinary stakeholders to devise strategies to deliver the messages from Aim 2 that most
effectively reduced over-screening intentions (Aim 3).
 The proposed project will identify effective messaging strategies to promote appropriate screening
cessation and reduce over-screening for breast cancer in older women and engage stakeholders to inform
message dissemination. The results will directly inform a communication intervention as a next step to reduce
breast cancer over-screening among older women."
10843316,"Abstract:
RNA splicing generates enormous variations at the RNA and protein levels to regulate cell-type-
specific functions as well as being the cause for numerous diseases. Several classes of splicing
patterns have been widely studied, such as exon skipping, intron retention and alternative
splicing sites. Advances in sequencing technologies enable the discovery of previously
unknown non-canonical splicing events. However, due to the lack of dedicated computational
approaches, the prevalence and functional consequences of these non-canonical splicing
events remain unexplored. The goal of our research program in the next five years is to develop
novel and specialized computational algorithms for discovery and characterization of emerging
splicing patterns that are currently understudied. We will focus on exitrons and non-linear-
spliced transcripts in our proposed study, as these two non-canonical splicing models have
been implicated in complex human diseases reported by recent studies. We will develop a
series of algorithms to (1) comprehensively catalog these novel splicing patterns using short
and long read sequencing platforms, (2) dissect the genetic basis of non-canonical splicing
events with integrative analysis of deep transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing data, and
(3) elucidate the functional impacts of novel forms of RNA splicing alternations using a
proteogenomic strategy. Our proposed work is innovative in that we will build unique
computational frameworks to detect and characterize novel non-canonical splicing events by
integrating large multi-omics datasets (e.g. TCGA, GTEx and ENCODE). It is significant
because it can be applied both in basic research to improve transcriptome annotation and
potentially in genomic medicine to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
complex diseases."
10839346,"Ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a major group of natural
products (NPs) produced in all domains of life. The number of RiPP families continues to expand rapidly
based on genome sequencing. RiPPs a·re well suited for genome mining for new natural products by
heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and for library generation of cyclic peptides
to recognize diverse targets. Furthermore, RiPPs appear to be widely encoded in the human microbiome
and have recently been implicated in causation and prevention of human disease. For the RiPP field to
advance, a better understanding of the post-translational modification processes is important. Similarly,
tools need to be developed to take advantage of the substrate tolerance of the biosynthetic enzymes. In the
current application we describe our progress towards these goals and our proposed studies for continued
advances. This application focuses mostly on the lanthipeptides, a group of polycyclic peptides with
macrocyclic thioether crosslinks. Individual lanthipeptides have a variety of biological activities including
antimicrobial, antiviral, antifungal and anti-allodynic. At least four different routes to lanthipeptides have
evolved and lanthipeptide BGCs are ubiquitous amongst the RiPP family in sequenced genomes. For one
of these four pathways, substrate recognition is reasonably understood but for the other three this
information is lacking and will be a focus of continued research . Another poorly understood aspect is the
factors that control the ring topology of the multiple thioether rings that are formed and this question will be
a focus of investigation. Furthermore, previous work suggests that lanthipeptide biosynthesis takes place in
enzyme complexes that may require its substrate. A method for catalytically competent covalent
attachment of the substrate to the key enzyme will be used to try and structurally characterize such enzyme
complexes. In addition, the mechanisms of a family of enzymes that make amino acid-derived NPs in a
novel pathway will be investigated and the pathways in which they operate will be determined. Improved
engineering technology to disrupt protein-protein interactions with cyclic peptides will be developed.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Based on historical precedent, the most likely group of compounds to deliver new antibiotics to fight
antibiotic resistance are natural products. Genome sequences offer unprecedented access to new natural
products that could be future antibiotics but for this information to be used, biosynthetic enzymes that make
the natural products need to be better understood. This application aims to obtain this information."

10880536,"The overall objective of the Program Project is to optimize every patient’s likelihood of reaching a pathologic complete
response (pCR) by using imaging, histopathology and molecular biomarkers to guide their treatment. Project 2 focuses on
advancing the imaging methods in the evolved design of I-SPY2.2, to identify patients that might benefit from a change in
course of treatment. In the I-SPY2 trial design, MRI measurements of functional tumor volume (FTV) are the biomarker
used to inform the longitudinal model for evaluation of drug arms. In I-SPY2.2, FTV is used at the individual patient level
to tailor treatments, raising the need for greater control over variability in MRI performance. We have been addressing
many of the elements involved in standardization of MRIs performed in the clinical setting through NCI-funded efforts in
the area of quantitative imaging. We also performed retrospective studies using data from 990 patients randomized to one
of 9 experimental drug arms completed by 2016 to better understand the impact of variability on FTV’s performance as a
biomarker and those findings have been used to introduce refinements to the I-SPY2 MRI exam protocol. Specific Aims 1
and 2 focus on iterative improvements to the de-escalation strategy and pre-RCB, as well as the escalation strategy,
respectively. While FTV-based response provides the initial signal for considering a change in treatment, different
strategies are required to improve the level of certainty for recommending escalation or de-escalation, given MRI’s
relative strength in demonstrating extensive disease, and limitation in detecting minimal disease. In the pre-RCB de-
escalation strategy, a negative finding on core biopsy of the tumor bed at 12-weeks is required before the option to omit
AC is offered. In the scenario of escalation, we use MRI response of less than 30% at 3-weeks to flag potential poor
response and recommend repeat imaging at 6-weeks, where the threshold for escalation to Block B is <65% FTV
response. We will build on these initial strategies in several ways. Current MRI prediction models are based on data from
the initial 990 patients enrolled under I-SPY2 and have been optimized within subtypes defined by HR and HER2. We
will refine these models using the more biologically-relevant Response-Predictive Subtype schema and using expanded I-
SPY patient cohorts. More comprehensive MRI prediction models twill be developed, integrating classifiers of shape,
heterogeneity and normal tissue features that can be derived from the same MRI data used to measure FTV. Working with
Project 3 investigators, we will pose the question of added value of ctDNA in both the de-escalation and escalation
strategies, investigating the use of ctDNA at multiple timepoints. Specific Aim 3 addresses the potential additive benefit
of serial FTV measurement to the histopathologic endpoint residual cancer burden (RCB) which has been well-established
as prognostic in the neoadjuvant setting. Recognizing the unique setting of I-SPY 2 in which MRI is performed for all
patients, and that serial MRI is not feasible in all clinical settings, we will specifically investigate the differential benefit
by subtype and treatment arms to determine if there are sub-groups of patients for whom added prognostic information is
particularly informative and MRI can be recommended. Specific Aim 4 will explore the use of imaging markers derived
from 18F-fluoroestradiol (FES)dedicated breast PET for patients receiving endocrine treatment in an I-SPY2.2 substudy."
10880539,"The I-SPY2 trial is a multicenter, Phase II neoadjuvant platform trial for high risk, early-stage breast cancer designed to
rapidly identify new treatments and treatment combinations with increased efficacy on a standard-of-care background
(sequential weekly paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (T-AC) chemotherapy). It is considered the
archetype of the adaptive platform trial, enabling multiple novel treatment regimens to be evaluated simultaneously,
targeting treatment to breast cancer subtypes defined by on hormone receptor (HR) and Human Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor-2 (HER2) expression, and MammaPrint (prognosis signature) high risk status. Since launching in 2010, 24 new
therapies or combinations have been tested, and 7 found to significantly improve pathologic complete response (pCR),
leading to several definitive phase III trials. However, with this success came the realization that within the 8 predefined
subtypes not everyone benefitted. Through this program project we designed and implemented a next generation I-SPY2.2
trial to advanced personalized medicine in early breast cancer treatment with a patient-centric approach to clinical drug
development. I-SPY2.2 allows the optimization of individual treatments by escalation or de-escalation of therapy based on
treatment response measured by an MRI-based assessment, doing so in the context of a trial that efficiently evaluates
novel potential first-line regimens. Project 3 has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the dynamics of the
biology of response and treatment resistance and enhancing our ability to better target agents to individual biology by
improving stratification of high-risk tumor biology. In collaboration with Project 4, we developed more refined response-
predictive subtypes, ‘RPS,’ that modelling suggests will result in improvements in pCR rates of over 15%. Characterizing
and understanding the biology and dynamics of treatment non-response in stage 2 and 3 breast cancer provides the
mechanistic basis for the rational design of treatment switching strategies and development of composite measures to
assess treatment response and recurrence risk to guide clinical decision-making. In our current proposal and based of our
earlier work in the program project and beyond, we now hypothesize that a comprehensive approach to understand non-
response across multiple omics levels (Aim 1) and integrated with dynamic imaging features (from Project 2), will
provide the best strategy for robust results for either escalation or de-escalation in the course of the trial treatment (Aim 2;
for Project 1). We have extended our experimental platforms with several that are based on liquid biopsies (such as
ctDNA, immune cytokine typing and exosome analyses of protein/phosphoproteins). This, in combination with an
extension of our technologies already employed in our current grant, will give us the best option to prioritize alternative
therapies in case of early, or later observed non-response (Aim 3). Druggable targets thus revealed will inform Project 4
for innovative drug selection. The dynamic changes in biomarkers in tumor or blood observed will provide the robustness
to escalate or de-escalate treatment for patients with observed early non-response, or robust response. The ultimate goal is
to get all high-risk patients to a complete response and thereby significantly reducing chance of recurrence and death."

Neuroimaging is a fundamental method for investigating the development of the human brain and spine structure
and function in typically and atypically developing populations. MR imaging is key to support the aims of Park-
Reeves Chiari & Syringomyelia Center (PRCSC) and the four sub-projects within the proposal. The goals of the
Radiology imaging core (RC) are to provide comprehensive MRI service to the different projects within the
PRCSC to facilitate imaging data acquisition. The RC will coordinate the initial and follow up MRI scans across
all projects and cores. This will include close coordination with the administrative and clinical cores, clinical
teams, and the Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR) to guarantee scheduling at the appropriate times.
The RC will perform the required steps to ensure quality control of the MRI scanners using regular phantom test
scans and scan protocol compliance checks. Further, the RC will cover the full extent of handling of the MR
imaging data, including using state-of-the art archiving software for all the PRCSC neuroimaging services. On
the input side this includes uploading, anonymizing, and securely storing the data using the Park-Reeves CSC
Centralized Neuroimaging Data Archive (CNDA). On the output side this includes giving access of the data to
the project investigators to maximize the quality and impact of the PRCSC research by center investigators and
their collaborators, securely distributing the raw and processed data to the different sub-projects as needed. The
RC will assist with the procedures for standardized processing of the data for future use by the different sub-
projects of the proposal. This includes simple anatomical measures, but also sophisticated software pipelines
for processing of fMRI and DBSI data. Finally, the RC will promote new methods for analyzing MRI data and will
provide a range of consultative and analytic services that will help PRCSC investigators, including new and early-
stage investigators, incorporate imaging into their research efforts."

Social isolation is associated with excessive alcohol use, depression, anxiety, and other poor outcomes (e.g.,
Daeppen et al., 2013; Moos et al., 2001; Muller et al., 2017; Zuckermann et al., 2020). Substantial variability also
exists in these associations, such that individuals with limited social ties do experience positive outcomes and
socially connected individuals similarly do experience negative outcomes (Bond et al., 2007; Bryan et al., 2017;
Eddie & Kelly, 2017; Spohr et al., 2019). Despite the importance of social factors in alcohol use and related
outcomes, the mechanisms via which social connectedness or isolation yield positive and negative outcomes
remains largely unexplored, in part due to difficulties eliciting and quantifying interpersonal processes in a
parametric manner. We have previously shown that sensitivity to social signals may be parameterized in the
context of interactive behavioral economic games and provide powerful tools with which to examine sources of
variability and potential mechanisms through which social preferences are related to mental health (Chung et
al., 2015; Chiu et al., 2008; King-Casas et al., 2005, 2008; King-Casas & Chiu, 2012). Here, we use these tools
to test the possibility that sensitivity to social signals in the context of social interaction influences how social ties
yield variability in alcohol use, mood, and anxiety.
To examine associations among social connectedness, sensitivity to social signals, and outcomes, we combine
a longitudinal cohort design including time-lagged mediation analyses, functional neuroimaging, and a behavioral
economic social exchange task. We will assess these associations (i) contemporaneously in Aim 1, (ii) over time
in Aim 2, and (iii) following social restrictions related to COVID-19 in a large online sample in Aim 3. The broad
hypothesis is that sensitivity to social signals (as measured by neurocomputational indices) will both moderate
and mediate associations between social ties and alcohol use and related outcomes. The work is submitted in
response to PAR-19-373 requesting applications addressing basic mechanisms of social connectedness,
connection, and isolation, including those related to COVID-19. The application further is in line with specific
interests of NIAAA and NIMH and in “mechanistic studies of the biopsychosocial causes and effects of social
connection and isolation” and “behavioral [and] neurobiological mechanisms of social connection and isolation
leading to alcohol use, addiction, or cessation of consumption.”"
10892637,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this investigation is to characterize the influence of the DNA methylome central to the increased risk of
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) observed in African Americans compared to
European Americans. To facilitate an improved understanding of the epigenetic modifications underlying the
disparate trends in MGUS risk observed by race, we will address MMDPQ1: What risk factors, singularly or in
cooperation, explain the variation in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) incidence
among different races? MGUS precedes Multiple Myeloma (MM), which is the most common blood cancer
affecting African Americans, characterized by cellular resistance to apoptosis leading to prolonged survival and
accumulation of clonally expanded, cytogenetically heterogeneous, antibody producing tumor cells in the bone
marrow and extramedullary sites. Risk of MGUS is 2- to 3-fold higher among African Americans compared to
European Americans and beyond a few well-established risk factors (race, male sex, obesity, family history of
lymphoid malignancy) little is known about the observed disparity in MGUS risk. Although, evidence suggests a
germline component, inherited alterations in DNA sequence alone does not explain the disparity. Advances in
epigenomics offer new opportunities to characterize the heritable changes in gene activity, or plasticity in germline
variation due to past environmental exposures, which could significantly improve our understanding MGUS
etiology, differences by ancestry and provide new insight for improved clinical monitoring in high-risk populations.
We will test the overarching hypothesis that distinct methylome signatures correlate with the excess risk of MGUS
observed in African Americans and that aberrant epigenetic modification influences the disparity in risk by altering
target gene expression. Using an epigenome-wide approach, we will capitalize on a unique opportunity to explore
differentially methylated positions in DNA obtained from a network of well-characterized, treatment naïve
populations of MGUS and MM while taking advantage of recent technological and analytic advances. This project
leverages existing partnerships, resources and comprehensive, high-quality clinical data and biospecimens
systematically collected in a well-characterized network of treatment-naïve populations, to improve our
understanding of the disparate trends in MGUS risk observed by race and to advance a set of biomarkers required
to improve efforts to predict and manage MGUS clinical course in high-risk African American populations."
10820445,"Summary
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas (MEC) are the most common type of malignant salivary gland tumor (SGT) with
advanced MEC often being fatal due to resistance to conventional therapies. Despite their prevalence in
salivary malignancies and occurrence in other tissues throughout the body, a thorough understanding of the
key molecular events leading to their development has not been fully elucidated. In fact, the incomplete
molecular characterization of SGTs was identified by the NIH/NIDCR as a major roadblock to the creation of
new clinical diagnostics and therapies. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving
MEC development and progression is critical to developing better therapeutic interventions. The Aims
of this proposal address these significant knowledge gaps through the seamless integration of expertise, tools,
and technologies, assembled by our group to investigate how coordinated regulation of two key signaling
pathways by a CRTC1-MAML2 (C1/M2) fusion oncogene regulates differentiation and tumor grade in salivary
MEC. The C1/M2 fusion is recognized as a key defining feature occurring in over 50% of MEC cases, which
reprograms the CREB transcriptional network to drive tumorigenesis. However, in addition to CREB, our recent
work and exciting Preliminary Studies now reveal that the C1/M2 oncoprotein also harbors gain-of-function
properties that enable MYC binding and co-activation of the MYC transcriptional network. Mechanistically, our
data reveal an etiologic role for C1/M2 in the altered cell heterogeneity associated with advanced salivary MEC,
identify IGF-1 signaling as a hallmark of fusion positive MEC, and uncover antagonistic roles for C1/M2-CREB
versus C1/M2-MYC in promoting differentiation or de-differentiation, respectively. Moreover, we developed and
validated the first autochthonous mouse model of salivary MEC that faithfully mimics the genetic and
pathologic features of human disease. Therefore, our central hypothesis states that C1/M2 influences intra-
tumoral heterogeneity during salivary MEC development and progression by balancing expression of
CREB and MYC transcriptional programs that control cell differentiation. To interrogate the molecular
and cellular events that initiate, maintain the malignant state, and mediate response to therapy, we also
developed an innovative optical reporter and mouse model that permits longitudinal characterization of
tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1 we will establish whether IGF-1 regulation promotes MEC tumorigenesis and
drug resistance. In Specific Aim 2 we will elucidate the mechanisms governing C1/M2 interactions with MYC
and the functional significance of these interactions, and in Specific Aim 3 we will determine the clinical
significance of regulating CREB versus MYC in relation to MEC pathology."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Furthermore, despite aggressive lipid-lowering strategies, e.g., statins and anti-PCSK9 blocking antibodies, most
individuals still suffer from recurrent myocardial infarctions and strokes. This “residual risk” has now been
attributed to excessive inflammation and pathologic vascular remodeling, cellular events that alter vessel
architecture, drive extracellular matrix degradation, and promote vascular calcification. While directly targeting
inflammation is a challenging approach, as those receiving anti-inflammatory therapies experience a significant
increase in the risk of death due to infection or sepsis, developing strategies that attenuate extracellular matrix
(ECM) degradation and vascular calcification are vital to the next generation of successful cardiovascular
therapeutics. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive these features of plaque instability
have yet to be fully revealed. Our supporting data herein provide evidence that the polyamine biosynthetic
pathway, which generates amino acid-derived small polycations, becomes dysregulated during atherosclerosis
progression and that impairments in polyamine biosynthesis drive vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC)
phenotypic modulation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis,
catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid ornithine into putrescine, and our new data identify a critical role for
ODC1-dependent putrescine synthesis in vSMC function during atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that (1)
putrescine synthesis by vSMCs decreases as atherosclerosis progresses in humans, particularly in unstable
plaques, and mice, (2) impairments in putrescine synthesis lead to vSMC phenotypic modulation, and (3) vSMCs
that are incapable of synthesizing putrescine show enhanced degradation of ECM proteins and increased
calcium deposition, features of atherosclerosis that drive plaque instability. Accordingly, these preliminary data
lead us to form the overarching hypothesis that impaired putrescine synthesis in vSMCs drives plaque
destabilization by promoting phenotypic modulation, increasing ECM degradation, and enhancing vascular
calcification. Based on the above premises and our extensive supporting data, we propose that impaired
putrescine synthesis in vSMCs drives plaque destabilization by promoting phenotypic modulation, increasing
ECM degradation, and enhancing vascular calcification. Our main objectives are to (1) define the mechanisms
by which putrescine synthesis promotes vSMC differentiation, (2) determine the mechanisms by which impaired
putrescine synthesis drives extracellular matrix degradation and vascular calcification in atherosclerosis, and (3)
identify the mechanisms that impair putrescine synthesis in vSMCs during atherosclerosis. Successful
completion of these aims will identify the mechanisms by which impairments in putrescine promote plaque
instability and demonstrate that strategies to enhance putrescine synthesis in vSMCs mitigates atherosclerosis."

Protein-protein interactions are governed by recognition events between peptide secondary structures (a-
helices, b-sheets, loops), which in turn provide design cues for the development of selective chemical probes.
However, removal of ordered peptide domains from the context of the surrounding tertiary structure compromises
folding and conformational stability. Mimicry and disruption of b-strand/sheet interactions remains a considerable
challenge. This is largely due to the inherent flexibility of short peptide sequences, the propensity for b-strands
to aggregate, and the large surface areas and diverse modes of b-sheet packing. The early oligomerization of
several amyloidogenic proteins involves conformational reorganization into parallel b-sheet structures, followed
supramolecular assembly into toxic fibrils. Recent atomic-level structural data using patient-derived extracts has
revealed that neurotoxic amyloids may be characterized by unique structural polymorphs, or ‘strains’, depending
on the disease. Despite the need for amyloid- and strain-specific ligands, b-rich amyloid assemblies represent
particularly challenging targets. We recently established peptide backbone N-amination as a subtle yet
remarkably effective approach to b-strand/sheet stabilization. The conformational and non-aggregating
characteristics of N-amino peptides (NAPs) render them uniquely suited for capping the growth of sheet fibrils
while maintaining the facial packing and sidechain interdigitation important for amyloid recognition. Here, we will
further develop soluble mimics of diverse b-sheet-like folds to disrupt amyloid aggregation in a sequence and
strain-specific manner. As a proof-of-concept, we will target the assembly and cellular transmission of tau fibrils
that characterize numerous sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Our overarching hypothesis
is that the structural features of peptide N-amination will enable the development of ligands that selectively target
b-rich amyloid folds. In Aim 1 we will expand the utility of NAP modification in pursuit of hyperstable b-strands
and amyloid mimics based on parallel b-sheet macrocycles. A library of NAP-based tau mimics will be
synthesized in Aim 2. These compounds will be evaluated for their ability to block aggregation and cellular
transmission of recombinant tau fibrils as well those extracted from AD patients. In Aim 3, we will synthesize a
series of aggregation-resistant NAP macrocycles that mimic the cross-b packing observed in pathogenic tau
strains. These will be evaluated for their capacity to specifically inhibit cellular seeding by tau fibrils derived from
AD and CBD brains. We anticipate that ligands emerging from this study will enable a robust examination of the
the pathogenic strain model of tau transmission. More broadly, these studies will have a significant impact on
the design of other selective disruptors of b-sheet and amyloid assemblies that are inherently difficult to target."

Genetics is a foundational discipline central to biomedical research and clinical practice. Our mission is to train
geneticists for the 21st century. To achieve this goal, we have designed and implemented an interdisciplinary
training program to transform graduate education in genetics and genomics at the University of Minnesota. Our
Specific Aims are: (i) to provide students with rigorous and quantitative training in the fundamentals and state-
of-the-art advances in genetics, genomics, and computational biology; (ii) to leverage the many collaborative
research and educational strengths of our institution to provide new interdisciplinary student-centered graduate
training opportunities that transcend departmental and collegiate boundaries; and (iii) to generate a diverse
cohort of well-trained scientists able to integrate their broad skillset and their hunger for lifelong learning into
their work across a multitude of careers in the biomedical workforce. This program will enable trainees to
pursue many impactful career opportunities in academia, biotechnology, government, health care, or education
created by recent advancements in genetics and genomics, including careers in fields that are undergoing
rapid change, as well as careers in areas that do not presently exist or that are nascent. In recognition of the
fact that the geneticists of tomorrow must possess quantitative acumen, we have not only developed new
courses emphasizing bioinformatics and computational approaches, but we have also integrated these into our
training program through a major redesign of the graduate curriculum pursuant to evaluation by internal and
external review panels. In a sense, genetics and genomics are foundational fields that transcend and unify
multiple disciplines within the biological sciences because what sets living things apart from inanimate objects
is that all living things possess within them molecular blueprints for their construction, genomes. An impactful
aspect of this academic and research training program is that it seeks to transcend traditional departmental
boundaries by bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines within the biomedical sciences who
utilize genetic and genomic analyses in their research. In so doing, this training program seeks to promote
interdisciplinary research, foster collaborative team science, and implement individualized student-centered
educational and career development programs. Our training program includes 50 highly productive and
collaborative faculty from ten departments across five colleges at the University of Minnesota. We are seeking
support for six PhD trainees for two years each beginning in year two of their academic program, with funding
for year one provided by institutional funds. In addition to their thesis research, trainees will participate in
professional development programs aimed at promoting their transition into and long-term success in
biomedical science-related careers."

Oncogenic KRASG12C (KG12C) mutations underpin the development of ~14% of non-squamous non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and account for ~10,000 deaths annually in the U.S. The development of potent, selective and
clinically active covalent inhibitors of the KG12C oncoprotein represents one of the most exciting recent advances
in the field of targeted cancer therapy, yet strategies to circumvent the development of adaptive resistance and
improve the durability of individual responses to KG12C inhibitors are urgently needed in order to transform clinical
outcomes for patients. The role of crosstalk between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the
development of acquired KG12C inhibitor resistance in NSCLC has not been systematically examined to date,
despite evidence that in more than 50% of cases no genomic resistance mechanisms can be identified at the
time of radiological progression. Furthermore, key mediators of TME remodeling and immune escape in
response to KG12C inhibitor therapy remain poorly defined and therapeutic strategies that target the adverse TME
in order to prevent, delay or overcome KG12C inhibitor adaptation/acquired resistance have not been established.
Finally, the impact of major co-occurring genomic alterations in STK11/LKB1 and TP53 and that shape the
immune contexture of KRAS-mutant NSCLC– on non-genetic mechanisms of acquired KG12C inhibitor resistance
is not known. Based on our preliminary findings and previous work we hypothesize that: 1. Remodeling of the
tumor microenvironment and immune escape can promote non-tumor cell autonomous adaptation/acquired
resistance to KG12C inhibitors; 2. Targeting STAT3 signaling with TTI-101 can forestall and possibly overcome
non-genetic acquired resistance to KG12C inhibitors through effects on tumor cells and/or the TME. In Aim 1, we
will determine the contribution of TME remodeling and immune escape to acquired KG12C inhibitor resistance in
NSCLC, using immune competent models of KG12C NSCLC that recapitulate its co-mutational complexity. We will
further interrogate the role of master mediators of TME adaptive remodeling with initial focus on STAT3 and we
will validate key findings using paired biopsies from patients with metastatic KG12C-mutant NSCLC that were
treated with sotorasib as part of standard of care. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy and TME-
modifying effects of STAT3 inhibition with TTI-101 in combination with direct KG12C inhibitors in immune-
competent models of KG12C NSCLC. Clinical significance: This work will yield fresh insights into non-genetic
mechanisms of acquired resistance to KG12C inhibitors that rely on tumor-TME crosstalk and will facilitate the
development of novel therapeutic strategies that tackle the adverse TME in order to maximize long-term clinical
benefit from KG12C inhibitors."

goal of this Training Program proposal is to leverage this outstanding environment to support the training of
M.D., M.D./Ph.D or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows by providing exceptional research opportunities and mentorship
in three broad areas: A) Gastrointestinal inflammation and the microbiome; B) Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), hepatic inflammation and fibrosis; and C) Genetics of gastrointestinal and liver diseases. The highly
structured training program provides a tailored curriculum that integrates clinico-epidemiologic-, genetic-,
environmental- and cellular/molecular research excellence. The program is built upon a foundation of world class
research faculty who have outstanding track records of academic achievement and successful mentorship. The
curriculum focuses on cross-disciplinary training in order to prepare trainees for the current and future challenges
of gastrointestinal and liver disease research, which now requires integration of complementary research skill
sets. To address this need, a highly selected pool of mentors has been chosen not only from within the Divisions
of GI and Liver Diseases and other clinical disciplines, but who also represent outstanding multi-disciplinary
institutes at the ISMMS.
Each year this program will support 3 trainees (PGY 4 - PGY 6), with 15 candidates entering the program over
5 years. Each trainee will pursue an individualized research project and tailored curriculum formulated together
with their primary and secondary mentors, curriculum committee and the Program Directors. Trainees will
dedicate at least 90% effort in either the laboratory or clinical setting, and their progress will be monitored through
quarterly meetings with their advisory committee and program directors. Overall quality and adaptability of the
program will be ensured through oversight by internal and external advisory boards, based on compliance with
defined metrics of success for both individual trainees and the overall program. This rigorously structured and
closely monitored program, committed to excellence and built upon a rich scientific environment and outstanding
faculty, will yield superbly trained future leaders in investigative gastroenterology and hepatology."
10830320,"Abstract
Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) occurs in one-third of critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and treated
with kidney replacement therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU). Occurrence of IDH is associated with
increased resource utilization such as fluid and vasopressor administration, discontinuation of kidney
replacement therapy, decreased recovery of kidney function, dependence on kidney replacement therapy and
death. IDH is often unrecognized until it is well established, by which time patients are refractory to treatment
or have already developed organ injury. Thus, if one could accurately predict who and when patients develop
IDH, then effective preemptive treatments could be administered to reduce risk of IDH and improve outcomes.
Our preliminary work showed that advanced high-frequency data modeling and waveform analysis identified
patients at risk for hypotension within 2 minutes of monitoring in the ICU, and if monitored for 5 minutes,
differentiated between patients who would develop hypotension or remain stable over the next 48 hours. In this
proposal entitled “Artificial Intelligence Driven Acute Renal Replacement Therapy (AID-ART)”, we propose to
apply predictive analytics using linked electronic health record and high-frequency monitor data to critically ill
patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing intermittent and continuous kidney replacement therapies at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic ICUs. We will examine the accuracy of various
machine learning models to predict IDH risk-evaluating model performance, usability, alert frequency, lead time
and number needed to alert, and hospital mortality and dependence on kidney replacement therapy (Aim 1a);
predict response to a range of clinical interventions for IDH and subsequent clinical outcomes (Aim 1b); and
perform cross validation across the two healthcare systems (Aim 1c). We will construct reinforcement learning
systems to develop a rule-driven intervention for IDH alerts and measurement-driven responses to avoid and
respond to IDH based on principles of functional hemodynamic monitoring (Aim 2a). We will also develop a
reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal intervention strategy based on the probability of events
rather than in reaction to IDH events (Aim 2b). We will silently deploy and evaluate the ability of this artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithm to forecast IDH risk and recommend interventions in real-time across the two
healthcare systems. We will then assess the validity of recommended interventions using an expert clinician
adjudication panel (Aim 3a); and will compare the AI recommended interventions with that of actual
interventions performed by bedside clinicians (Aim 3b). This proposal will be the harbinger of a future
multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine personalized risk prediction and AI-augmented management of
IDH among critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and undergoing kidney replacement therapy in the
intensive care unit."

How secreted signaling proteins act at a cell-biological level to orchestrate animal development and maintain
adult tissues is poorly understood. The research program described here seeks to elucidate how signaling
mechanisms at the molecular level are integrated with cell architectures and behaviors to regulate signaling in
space and time. Such knowledge will provide insights into essential mechanisms of development and
homeostasis. It will also have impacts relevant to human health as many of the same signaling pathways are
implicated in cancers and are key players in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The broad goal of
this program over the next five years is to dissect fundamental cell biological mechanisms that underlie cell-cell
signaling during development. Cells often use secreted signaling proteins to communicate at a range of
distances to regulate patterning and differentiation along with cellular behaviors such as migration and
morphogenesis. How these proteins move between cells to reach their destinations and activate signaling
remains largely unknown. We will use the worm C. elegans as a tractable model to investigate the cell
biological bases for these processes in a living animal. C. elegans is a powerful system to unravel mechanisms
due to the speed and efficiency of genome engineering, superb characteristics for live imaging, and a range of
methods for functional manipulations. The proposed work builds on prior efforts that identified essential
mechanisms that signaling proteins called Wnts use to disperse between cells and established experimental
systems to investigate other aspects of developmental signaling using advanced cell biology methods. Our
goals in the coming years are to elucidate: (1) functions for nerves in long distance Wnt signaling to non-neural
cells during development; (2) how spatial inputs from a cell signaling pathway are integrated with cell dynamics
to guide cell migration; and (3) how interactions between Wnts and other extracellular proteins control Wnt
spreading. Towards these goals, we will use a suite of approaches, including super-resolution live imaging,
genome engineering, and in vivo cell biology methods to interrogate developmental mechanisms with spatial
and temporal precision. Together, our efforts will provide novel and mechanistic insights into the cell biological
bases of animal development and build a framework for unique and sustained contributions."
10840835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The androgen-signaling pathway mediated through the androgen receptor is essential for prostate
embryonic development, prepubescent morphogenesis, and pubertal growth and regeneration. Mutation of the
Ar gene in testicular feminized mice results in the complete absence of prostate development. During
embryogenesis, the AR is initially detected in the urogenital sinus mesenchyme prior to the initiation of prostate
budding and morphogenesis, and its expression extends to the urogenital sinus epithelium after the initiation of
prostatic budding and branching morphogenesis. Early tissue recombination assays done more than 30 years
ago demonstrated that mesenchymal, rather than epithelial AR signaling plays a decisive role in inducing
development of the prostatic epithelium, providing the first scientific evidence for a stromal cell niche in
supporting prostate stem cell initiated prostate early development. Androgen signaling still remains essential
for prostatic postnatal morphogenesis, growth and regeneration. Prostatic regeneration through repeated
cycles of androgen withdrawal and replacement further demonstrates the essential role of androgen signaling
in prostate cell differentiation and growth. However, despite significant research effort in the past 30 years, the
underlying mechanisms by which androgens facilitate prostatic stem/progenitor cells through paracrine
interactions between prostatic epithelium and mesenchyme are largely unknown. Specifically, the cellular
properties of the AR-expressing mesenchymal cells that can convey androgen signaling to regulate prostatic
epithelial development and morphogenesis still remain unclear.
 Sonic hedgehog signaling plays a critical role in prostate development, homeostasis, and regeneration
through mesenchymal–epithelial interactions. The Shh growth factors and its downstream effectors are
expressed in either prostatic epithelial or mesenchymal cells, respectively, during embryogenesis and
adulthood. Recently, using mouse genetic tools, we demonstrate for the first time that selective deletion of AR
in mesenchymal Gli1-expressing cells abolishes prostatic embryonic development and prostate formation, and
diminishes prostate pubertal growth and regeneration. In addition, results from our tissue recombination
assays showed that mesenchymal AR and Gli1 expressing cells act as cell niches in supporting prostate early
development and prostatic gland formation. These findings provide fresh insight into the cellular identity of the
stromal cell niche in supporting prostate stem/progenitor function in the prostate, and implicate a new
regulatory mechanism for stromal androgen and Shh signaling in regulating prostatic cell fate, growth, and
renewal. Based on these new and significant findings, we propose a series of experiments to test our central
hypothesis: stromal androgen signaling in Shh-responsive cells acts as a stem cell niche and plays an
essential role for prostate early development, prepubescent morphogenesis, and pubertal growth and
regeneration."
10881647,"Dr. Paula C. Bickford is currently a Senior Research Career Scientist at the James A. Haley VA
Hospital in Tampa, FL. She continues to be a productive and collaborative VA scientist. Her
research focus is in the area of aging and neurodegenerative disease, specifically with a focus on the
innate immune system and how aging interacts with the innate immune system and how this then
impacts normal cognitive aging and the progression of many neurogedenerative diseases. It is now
well established that aging is the primary risk factor for a number of diseases that cross multiple
disciplines. The impact of this on research of neurodegenerative disease is that aging must be
considered as a co-morbidity factor in our models of disease, and in our approach to understanding
therapeutic treatments. Dr. Bickford’s invited review, “Aging leads to altered microglial function that
reduces brain resiliency increasing vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases”, published in
Experimental Gerontology this year discusses the impact of these aging on the innate immune system
of the brain. It is the goal of Dr. Bickford’s funded research programs to understand these complex
biological processes in order to design interventions such that either existing or new therapeutics
against neurodegenerative diseases will be more effective. Our recent data suggests that interventions
that work in young animal models of disease are not as effective in aging models. For example, in a
paper examining therapeutic interventions for traumatic brain injury featured in “This week in
Neuroscience” as one of the most influential manuscripts for that issue, we demonstrated that stem cell
therapies and conditioned media from stem cells is less effective in aged rats than young, likely due to
the pro-inflammatory environment of the aged brain reducing the survival of the cell therapy. Our
recent unpublished data on some small molecule and chemokine modes of therapies for Parkinson’s
disease are observing similar effects of aging. One of our VA Merit funded grants is examining this
question directly with proteomics of young versus aged microglia and has shown that several pathways
involving nutrient sensing and energy metabolism within microglia are altered and may underlie the
change in pro-inflammatory phenotype that is observed with aging and thus targeting the underlying
mechanistic changes with age, rather than directly reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, may have
broader impacts on increasing resiliency of the brain microenvironment, and thus a broad impact on
therapeutics of neurodegenerative disease. !"
10811739,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mucus contacted medical devices, such as airway devices and eye prostheses, suffer from mucus
accumulation. Plugged mucus causes bacterial infection, airway blockage, and a requirement of frequent
device cleaning and replacement, which adds significant care burdens for the patient and support community.
Current approaches to mitigate mucus accumulation involve strong mechanical forces or medications, thus
having intrinsic limitations and side effects. Mucociliary transport (MCT), a process by which waves of beating
cilia move a blanket of mucus, forms the first-line barrier against infection in respiratory and genital tracts.
Inspired by the effectiveness of MCT in clearing mucus, the objective of this project is to develop an
engineered surface that enables MCT function (i.e., an engineered surface of MCT). Our objective will be
achieved through a combination of cilia fabrication, surface modification, and acoustic actuation with the
following aims: fabricate engineered surfaces with polarized ciliary structures (Aim 1); understand mucus
stickiness on engineered surface of MCT. (Aim 2); develop platforms to test acoustic actuated MCT on
engineered surfaces in vitro and in vivo (Aim 3). The proposed research is rationally built on experimental
feasibility, investigator expertise, and a supportive research environment. The feasibility is supported by
experimental successes in polymer ciliary surfaces, slug and pig models of mucus, and vibration of
microstructures with acoustic waves. The team of investigators have expertise in MCT, microfluidics, acoustics,
3D printing, and animal models. The proposed research will be conducted within the environment of the world-
renowned Lung Physiology Research Center and Roy J. Carver Department of Biomedical Engineering at the
University of Iowa, with broad availability of complementary expertise in biology and engineering. The expected
outcomes of this project include revealing the mechanism of MCT on engineered surfaces and delivering an
innovative medical device product incorporating an engineered surface of MCT."

The Genomic Intensive Data Science Research, Education and Mentorship (GIDS-REM) program at the
University of Rochester aims to increase the number of researchers with strong quantitative skills in the
genomics workforce. The focus is on recruiting and retaining members of groups traditionally underrepresented
in biomedical fields. The proposal aims to 1) create a new track in genomics data science in the Goergen
Institute for Data Science Master’s program (GIDS-MS) and recruit a diverse group of scholars into the track;
2) build core competencies in genomics data science through curricular training, workshops, and research
experiences; and 3) retain GIDS-REM fellows in the genomics workforce through mentoring and cohort
building.
The innovative features of this proposal combine with existing strengths in research, academics, and
efforts to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion at the University of Rochester. This proposal leverages
the framework and resources for the existing GIDS-MS program and implements a new curriculum that trains
students in theoretical and applied aspects of both data science and genomics. Through a partnership with the
David T. Kearns Center for Leadership and Diversity, the targeted recruitment strategies will bring in diverse
scholars from underrepresented groups as GIDS-REM fellows. The proposal implements a team mentoring
approach that will connect fellows to genomics research advisors throughout the University of Rochester and
its Medical Center and industry. This proposal applies the University of Rochester’s strengths in cancer
genomics at the Wilmot Cancer Institute and translational genomic research at the Clinical and Translational
Science Institute. Key aspects of the proposal are in its culturally responsive mentor training and strong
community-building to create inclusive spaces that allow GIDS-REM fellows to thrive. These
approaches will improve the retention of fellows in doctoral programs or in industry positions in the field of
genomics. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed using quantitative and qualitative
benchmarks, and instruments to evaluate mentor competency and student self-efficacy. The GIDS-REM
program will not only have a direct impact on the fellows and their career directions, but will have a broad
impact on the genomics community at the University of Rochester and beyond."

 Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is responsible for 15% of the total deaths of AIDS patients. There is
no vaccine available for cryptococcosis and the disease claims hundreds of thousands of lives each year, with
the global mortality rates of ~70% despite current antifungal therapies. The challenges of preventing and
treating this disease motivate the investigation of cryptococcal pathways that are critical for pathogenesis. As
Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental basidiomycetous yeast, the ability to survive and amplify in
conditions physiologically relevant for the human host is a prerequisite for its pathogenesis. Both high
temperatures (≥37C) and CO2 levels (≥5%) in humans differ considerably from the fungus' primary
environmental niches (CO2 in ambient air is ~0.04%). Accordingly, environmental cryptococcal isolates that are
CO2-sensitive showed drastic virulence attenuation in mouse models of cryptococcosis. The applicant found
that disruption of any of the conserved components of the RAM pathway in the CO2-tolerant clinical isolate
H99, including the effector kinase Cbk1, rendered the strain unable to grow at host temperatures or CO2 levels.
Consistently, the cbk1 mutant is avirulent in both an intranasal infection model and an intravenous infection
model of cryptococcosis. Thus, understanding how the RAM pathway regulates cryptococcal thermotolerance
and CO2 tolerance will inform us about how this fungus adapts to host conditions to cause diseases in humans.
 As nothing is known about downstream effectors of the RAM pathway in basidiomycete fungi, the
applicant carried out a pilot suppressor screen of the cryptococcal cbk1 mutant. Analyzing the suppressor
mutants revealed that disruption of either of the two RNA-processing regulators, Ssd1 and Psc1, partially
restored cbk1's thermotolerance and CO2 tolerance. Ssd1 is conserved among fungi and a known target of
Cbk1 based on studies in ascomycetes, including model yeasts or pathogenic Candida species. In the
absence of phosphorylation by Cbk1, Saccharomyces Ssd1 translocates to processing or P-bodies and stress
granules, thereby suppressing translation of its bound mRNAs. By contrast, Psc1 is an uncharacterized protein
with a PARN RNA-recognition motif. The PARN motif is present in many eukaryotic lineages including
basidiomycete fungi and humans, but surprisingly absent in ascomycetes such as Saccharomyces or Candida
species. Based on these observations, the applicant hypothesizes that thermotolerance and CO2 tolerance in
Cryptococcus are regulated by the RAM pathway  at least partly  at the post-transcriptional level. In this
exploratory R21 application, the applicant seeks to (1) define Cbk1 kinase downstream targets in Cryptococcus
by comparative phosphoproteomics and extensive suppressor screens and (2) identify biological processes
controlled by the RAM pathway by defining the proteins and mRNAs bound by Ssd1 and Psc1 in the presence
and absence of Cbk1. These findings will deepen our understanding of how C. neoformans adapts to host
conditions and may reveal candidates that can be exploited for novel targets against this deadly disease."
10875382,"Project Summary
Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) rates have risen 40% in recent years with mortality rising 3.4% per year
over the last 15 years. Alcohol treatment, even just one session, improves liver disease mortality and liver
function, but only 10-15% of ALD patients engage in treatment after their diagnosis. To date, no interventions
to improve alcohol treatment engagement in ALD patients have been developed. To address this gap, we will
perform a sequential, multiple-assignment, randomized trial (SMART) to evaluate an adaptive intervention
strategy to increase alcohol treatment engagement. Adaptive interventions use specific decision rules tailored
to relevant clinical timepoints in the care of ALD patients to identify early non-responders to the initial
intervention and offer additional interventions to those who need them in order to improve clinical outcomes.
Our specific aims are: 1) To test the efficacy of an adaptive intervention which begins with the Michigan
Alcohol Improvement Network –Alcohol Reduction and Treatment (MAIN-ART) app versus Enhanced Usual
Care on alcohol treatment engagement (primary outcome) and alcohol reduction and liver health (secondary
outcomes); 2) To test the efficacy of the addition of a treatment facilitation bundle for increasing alcohol
treatment engagement among non-responders. Patients (n=268) enrolled in hepatology clinics with all stages
of ALD, past 6-month drinking and no past-month alcohol treatment will be randomized to either the MAIN-ART
app or Enhanced Usual Care. Intervention response at 3 months will be assessed and those who have not
engaged in alcohol treatment in either arm (“non-responders”) will be re-randomized to a second intervention,
the Treatment Facilitation bundle. The Treatment Facilitation bundle will be composed of two parts: 1) an
online barriers elicitation survey to determine patient-specific personal or structural barriers to alcohol
treatment, and 2) a virtual coaching session with an addiction social worker offered after completion of the
barriers survey to help facilitate alcohol treatment engagement by overcoming identified barriers. Outcomes
will be assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Exploratory aims are a) to determine the best adaptive
strategy to increase alcohol treatment engagement and b) to evaluate mediators and moderators of
intervention efficacy. The proposed work is innovative, timely, and directly responsive to NIAAA priorities to
improve access to alcohol treatment through barrier reduction and through extension of interventions into
novel, non-addiction clinic settings, such as hepatology clinics (NOT PAR-22-156). Using a novel SMART trial
design, the adaptive interventions developed and tested in this study will leverage the hepatology clinic
environment in an innovative way to increase alcohol treatment engagement for ALD patients and improve
clinical outcomes."
10802410,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Kidney transplant compared to dialysis dramatically improves survival and quality of life for patients with end
stage kidney disease (ESKD), but of the ~500,000 patients with ESKD in the US on dialysis, less than 1/5 are
listed for transplant. Despite widespread recognition of the need to improve access to transplant, rates of
waitlisting and transplant are substantially lower in patients in underserved communities, including individuals
with low socioeconomic status and those in underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. The current system for
educating patients is overwhelming and is designed to optimize clinical efficiency. Potential transplant
candidates must complete a lengthy evaluation process, often with additional appointments and requirements
depending on comorbidities, while also managing a severe chronic illness with high treatment burden. Thus, it
is not surprising that a high proportion of patients never access the waitlist or living donor transplant, and that
the system inadvertently favors patients with high health literacy and socioeconomic status. While the barriers
to transplant are complex, modifiable individual-level barriers contribute significantly to low transplant access.
Prior research supports an intervention provided to both patients and their social support networks (SN) but
many efficacious interventions are too resource intensive to implement in practice. There is a critical need to
identify feasible, efficacious interventions supporting underserved patients and SNs to improve access to
kidney transplant. This proposal seeks to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Journey to
Transplant (JtT), a virtual counseling session with the potential candidate along with their SN versus usual pre-
transplant education in a safety net hospital setting (Aim 1). The study will evaluate the effect of JtT on
intention to pursue transplant and on the determinants of behavioral change that are impacted by the
intervention. In addition, the proposal will assess multisite RCT implementation outcomes, including enrollment
rates and survey completion rates, as well as qualitative interviews with patients and providers on the barriers
to implementing the protocol in other safety net hospital settings (Aim 2). This proposal is in response to PAS-
20-160: Small R01s for clinical trials targeting diseases within the mission of NIDDK, that does not require
preliminary efficacy data, and will facilitate a future multisite, fully powered RCT to evaluate the effect of JtT on
improving transplant access in underserved populations. This research agenda is aimed at transforming the
paradigm of pre-transplant counseling, empowering underserved patients and their support networks to
improve critical life-altering decisions surrounding kidney transplantation."
10841037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Low-income adults in the United States have historically had worse dental health and overall
health status than higher income individuals and less access to dental and medical services.
Oral health is a key component of overall health and wellbeing. However, the relationships
between oral health and overall health are bi-directional and subject to several confounders.
Given these complex relationships, there is a need for evidence examining the causal impacts
of changes in access to dental services on overall health status. We will contribute substantially
to filling this knowledge gap by leveraging recent exogenous changes in dental coverage and
dental services use due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions as a natural
experiment to study effects of dental services use on overall health status. As of 2019, 33 states
expanded Medicaid eligibility to all non-elderly adults below 138% of the federal poverty level.
However, Medicaid dental coverage for adults is optional for states, and as a result, there is
significant variation in dental coverage across states and over time. This variation provides a
unique opportunity to understand the spillover effects of dental coverage and services use on
overall health status. The ACA Medicaid expansions with dental benefits have increased dental
visits and use of preventive and treatment dental services but effects differed by generosity of
dental benefits. That evidence demonstrates that the Medicaid expansions with their variation in
dental benefits provide a unique opportunity to understand connections between access to
dental services and overall health status. Taking advantage of a natural experiment and existing
data from two nationally representative surveys, we will provide the first evidence on effects of
the recent Medicaid expansions with dental benefits for low-income adults on their overall health
status over 7 years from the first expansions. We will examine heterogeneity in effects by state
generosity of dental coverage, dentist supply, and demographic variables associated with l
health status, oral health and dental services use. The evidence from the study is highly
relevant for accurate evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-benefit of oral health programs
and policies by accounting for spillover benefits to overall health. The evidence will also be
useful for Medicaid policies both nationally and for states. Findings will also inform discussions
among policymakers and stakeholders about offering dental coverage in Medicare for older
adults and in employer-sponsored or independently purchased plans. The study will also
motivate larger scale studies using other data sources such as claims data to assess changes
in dental and medical care use at the individual-level using quasi-experimental designs."
10791862,"Social and behavioral determinants of health and Alzheimer’s Disease: Cohort study of the US military
 veteran population
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects an estimated 5.8 million US adults. Veterans are particularly susceptible to
AD due to demographic, clinical, and economic factors. Social determinants of health are the conditions in
which people are born, live, work, and age. Adverse social determinants of health include job loss and financial
and food insecurity. Together with behavioral health factors (e.g., smoking and substance use) and mental
health, adverse social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) contribute to adverse health outcomes.
Associations between SBDH and AD have been noted, but most studies used structured electronic health
record (EHR) or survey data. SBDH are not routinely added to structured EHR. Natural language processing
(NLP) approaches can be developed to automatically extract SBDH and their attributes. This application
responds to PAR-22-093 and NOT-AG-18-047. The specific aims are:
Aim 1: Establish NLP-enriched case definitions of adverse SBDH and AD-related information (e.g., signs and
symptoms of cognitive decline), and examine their incidences by first chart-reviewing ~10,000 EHR notes (e.g.,
primary care, neurology, psychiatric, and social work notes) and then developing and evaluating sophisticated
NLP systems for automatically capturing SBDH and AD-related information.
Aim 2: Using NLP enriched SBDH as independent variables from a nested case-control design, we will
analyze the associations between adverse SBDH and incident AD. We will also evaluate how the associations
vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity. We will compare results using NLP-enriched SBDH vs. using structured data
(only) SBDH. Hypothesis 1: Patients with adverse SBDH have substantially higher AD risk, after adjusting for
potential covariables (e.g., patient-specific demographic and clinical factors). Hypothesis 2: The effects of
adverse SBDH on AD risk vary by age, sex and race/ethnicity, after adjusting for covariables (e.g., patient-
specific clinical factors). Hypothesis 3: The effects of adverse SBDH on incident AD are likely cumulative and
duration-dependent, with more and longer adverse SBDH leading to higher AD risk.
Aim 3: Early AD diagnosis may prevent or delay AD development through intervention efforts on SBDH.34
Cognitive decline occurs 4-8 years prior to AD diagnosis.35 We will study whether inclusion of NLP-enriched
adverse SBDH and AD-related information helps early AD diagnosis. We will use three types of predictive
models: statistical regression, traditional machine learning, and innovative deep learning models."

discoveries of novel biomarkers and increasing awareness of kidney health, the prevalence of CKD and end-
stage kidney disease (ESKD) continues to rise. To date, the lack of therapeutic options halting progression
from AKI to CKD still represents an unmet need. Our preliminary data suggest while activation of complement
component 5 receptor 1 (C5aR1) promotes renal tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) damage, C5aR1 signaling on
myeloid cells may confer renoprotective effects ameliorating AKI. This project will determine the roles of C5a-
C5aR1 axis activation in 1) RTEC cellular senescence and kidney fibrosis (Aim 1), and in 2) myeloid cells
responsible for AKI pathogenesis (Aim 2). These aims will test our central hypothesis that C5aR1 activation in
kidney resident macrophage (KRM) mitigates the acute phase of AKI, whereas C5a-C5aR1 signaling in RTEC
mediates their cellular senescence with subsequent CKD progression and fibrosis. Our findings will lay the
fundamental knowledge of the potential clinical use of complement-regulating therapies for kidney

10873720,"Strategies to access desirable analogues of natural products and pharmaceuticals in efficient,
practical, cost-effective, and stereoselective manners are central to organic synthesis and drug
discovery. Total synthesis of such analogues is often lengthy and inefficient, thus increasing the
time required to secure the desired molecules, as well as the cost of preparing compounds that
are important to human healthcare. Particularly attractive but challenging are schemes that
enable direct transformation of ubiquitous but otherwise chemically inert C–H bonds that are
contained in the polyfunctional bioactive molecules. We will develop catalytic processes that
entail oxidation of amine, ether, or thioether-based small molecule drugs into the corresponding
enamine, enol ether or thioenol ether derivatives; such intermediates will then be coupled with
various chemical tagging agents to generate – in a single operation – a library of drug
derivatives. The resulting compounds will contain ‘clickable’ handles that can be used as a
handle for bioconjugation. Some will carry tags for structure-activity relationship studies (e.g.,
biotin, fluorophore), and/or photoaffinity labels for chemoproteomics (e.g., arylazide, diazirine).
Various desirable analogues of N, O, and/or S-based medicinal agents will thus become readily
accessible; preparation of these entities by total synthesis would either be impossible or
substantially more cumbersome. A combination of Lewis acid and Brønsted base catalysts will
be used to promote the proposed transformations. We will utilize the above strategies to design
pathways that are significantly more efficient and broadly applicable than those previously
disclosed. Among the medicinally relevant molecules that will be subjected to the late-stage

10792885,"SUMMARY – mVACS PROGRAM
Clostridioides difficile is the most reported nosocomial pathogen in the United States and a major public health
threat worldwide. Challenges in treating infections with conventional antibiotics and increasing rates of recurrent
infection underscore the need for new interventions. To date, no vaccine has proven to be effective at clearing
C. difficile from infected individuals. The mVACS program—""mRNA Vaccines for C. difficile Suppression”—is
tightly focused on the goal of designing and implementing improved vaccines to mitigate or eliminate C. difficile
infection (CDI). For this we will employ modified mRNA vaccine technology, which has been pioneered so
successfully by team member Dr. Drew Weissman and his collaborators at BioNTech to immunize against SARS-
CoV-2. Already Drs. Weissman, Alameh, and Zackular have established a collaboration with BioNTech to
develop an mRNA targeting C. difficile toxins and other antigens and shown their lead formulation to be highly
protective in mice challenged with a lethal dose of C. difficile. However, C. difficile is not fully cleared from the
mice, and there is mild transient pathogenesis, so there is more to be done. The team is moving forward with
this anti-toxin vaccine, but improvements in design are necessary for optimal efficacy. The mVACS team is a
highly skilled and synergistic group dedicated to developing modified mRNAs to oppose C. difficile infection and
pathogenesis. The program consists of three projects and three cores. Project 1 (Vaccine Development)
(Project Leads: Alameh and Weissman) will test new mRNAs against multiple C. difficile targets, as well as
mixtures of mRNAs and novel nanoparticle/lipid formulations. Project 2 (Antigen Discovery) (Project Lead:
Zackular) will take advantage of advanced analysis of C. difficile microbiology and ecology of infection to produce
a series of novel vaccine targets. Project 3 (Immunology) (Project Lead: Abt) will quantify mucosal adaptive
immune responses against C. difficile in humans and mouse systems, identifying gaps and correlates of efficacy.
Projects 2 (Antigen Discovery) and Project 3 (Immunology) will flow new data to Project 1 (Vaccine
Development) to optimize vaccine design. The Projects will be complemented by three Cores: Core A
(Administrative Core) (Core Leads: Bushman and Weissman), Core B (Genomics Core) (Core Leads:
Bittinger, Bushman, and Moustafa) and Core C (Clinical Core) (Core Leads: Kelly and Conrad). Together with
our industry partner BioNTech, we are highly optimistic that we can advance effective new vaccine designs to
suppress C. difficile."
10850583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural variations are key drivers of both evolutionary adaptation and human disease. My group develops and
applies computational and statistical approaches for understanding the evolution of structural variations from
patterns in their genomic and transcriptomic data. During the past few years, our studies have focused primarily
on gene duplication, which represents the most common type of structural variation observed in nature. In
particular, we investigated the origins of evolutionary innovation after gene duplication, a problem of long-
standing interest in the evolutionary genomics community. To answer this question, we designed the first method
for classifying evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes from phylogenetic comparisons of their gene expression
profiles. By applying this decision tree method to multi-tissue gene expression data, we were able to classify
evolutionary outcomes of duplicate genes in Drosophila, mammals, and grasses. These studies revealed
frequent tissue-specific expression divergence after duplication, as well as sequence and expression differences
within and among taxa that are consistent with natural selection. In a follow-up population-genomic analysis, we
demonstrated that natural selection indeed plays an important role in the evolutionary outcomes of young
duplicate genes in Drosophila. Later, we developed analogous decision tree classifiers for two additional types
of structural variations: gene deletion and translocation. Applications of our methods to sequence and expression
data from multiple tissues and developmental stages in Drosophila uncovered rapid divergence concordant with
adaptation, suggesting that natural selection shapes the evolutionary trajectories of structural variations
generated by deletion and translocation as well. However, our recent analyses revealed that there are many
limitations of these decision tree methods, including sensitivity to gene expression stochasticity, lack of statistical
support, and inability to predict parameters driving the evolution of structural variations. Thus, during the next
five years, my group will develop a suite of tailored model-based statistical and machine learning approaches for
classifying the evolutionary outcomes and predicting the evolutionary parameters of structural variations arising
from duplication, deletion, inversion, and translocation events. Our preliminary studies indicate that these
techniques will be much more powerful and accurate than previous approaches, and will therefore compose
major advancements in evolutionary investigations of structural variations. In addition to implementing our
methods in open source software packages, we will apply them to assay the evolutionary implications of different
types of structural variations in humans and several other animal and plant taxa. Comparisons will be made
among different types of structural variations, their evolutionary outcomes, and taxonomic groups. The major
goal of these studies will be to ascertain the general rules by which different types of structural variation
contribute to evolutionary innovation. Together, these studies will shed light on how gene duplication, deletion,
inversion, and translocation work in concert to generate a diversity of complex adaptations across the tree of life."

reporting and renewal, assisting the 2 developing shared resources to become fully operational within the next
3 years, facilitating and monitoring progress of the UFHCC Plan to Enhance Diversity, and measuring the impact
of the UFHCC on the cancer burden of the catchment area."
10850878,"CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING & EDUCATION COORDINATION: ABSTRACT
Cancer Research Training & Education Coordination (CaRTEC) is a major pillar of the University of Florida
Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) strategic plan. Led by Siemann (CTHR), Associate Director for Education and
Training, it provides a continuum of education and training opportunities that encompass pre-collegiate and
undergraduate programs, pre- and postdoctoral and clinical training initiatives, faculty mentoring, and career
enhancement. CaRTEC integrates and enhances cancer education, research training, and career-development
activities at all trainee and faculty levels. At the pre-collegiate level, UFHCC summer programs introduce high
school students to cancer research through lectures and lab experiences to encourage their academic choices.
An innovative program for middle and high school science teachers promotes advances in cancer research and
care. An undergraduate scholars program in basic, clinical, or population science provides UF students with
opportunities to collaborate on research projects and aims to motivate students to pursue careers in cancer
research. Cancer research and career opportunities for minority students are promoted by NCI and UFHCC-
funded programs providing training in laboratories of UFHCC members. Graduate students in the Cancer Biology
Concentration (CBC) of the UF College of Medicine Graduate Program in Biomedical Sciences join a vibrant
academic program offering training in fundamental and translational cancer research. Reflecting the
transdisciplinary nature of UF cancer research, the CBC is comprised of graduate faculty representing a wide
range of UF colleges. At the postdoctoral level, CaRTEC supports the strategic recruitment of postdoctoral
fellows to strengthen the number of trainees interested in all aspects of cancer research. Since 2016, 102
UFHCC members have trained 542 graduate students and 192 postdoctoral trainees, of whom 89 (12%) have
identified as underrepresented minorities and 360 (49%) are women. Early-stage investigators are each
assigned a principal mentor and mentoring advisory committee to review their research plans and grants, and
foster their professional development. Clinical faculty and trainees have opportunities to enhance skills through
short courses in clinical research and biostatistics as well as a think tank for investigator-initiated clinical trials.
The UFHCC supports continuing medical education for members and community physicians. Building on UFHCC
assets, in 2021, a novel team-based interdisciplinary cancer-focused NCI-funded T32 Training Grant for pre-
and postdoctoral fellows and an American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant were awarded. Long-
term goals are to 1) prepare the next generation of basic, clinical, and population scientists for successful cancer
research careers; and, 2) facilitate the engagement of researchers in community dialogue to promote awareness
of cancer risk factors, cancer research, and treatment. In alignment with the Plan to Enhance Diversity, new
initiatives include a UFHCC Pilot Diversity Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP), submission
of an R25 Diversity PREP application, and development of additional cancer-focused T32 applications."
10850883,"PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY (PED): ABSTRACT
The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) is committed to building a workforce reflecting the
diverse U.S. population with scientific capabilities, leadership skills, and cultural competency to address racial,
geographic, structural, and socioeconomic disparities in the UFHCC catchment area. The PED is directed by
Ricks-Santi (CCPS), Associate Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and supported by a DEI
Committee charged with setting goals for diversity, developing activities to enhance diversity, mentoring, and
monitoring progress. The current UFHCC membership is 35% female and 9% underrepresented minorities
(URM), up from 28% and 6%, respectively, at the 2019 CCSG submission. Among the 58 new recruits to the
UFHCC since 2016, 26 (45%) were women. The UFHCC recruited 10 URMs (17%; 5 Black and 5 Hispanic
members) of which the majority are ESIs. Since 2019, 4 women were appointed to leadership positions (2 ADs,
1 program leader, and 1 Disease Site Group Leader), with 1 being a URM. Building on this progress,
opportunities identified include a) increasing diversity in the cancer research training pipeline and academic
workforce; b) increasing the number of cancer research training programs and opportunities focused on groups
underrepresented in the cancer research workforce (URGs); c) increasing the number of URG members,
including those promoted and holding tenure; and, d) increasing opportunities and positions for women and other
members of URGs to join cancer center leadership. The PED has 4 aims: 1) enhance the diversity of the cancer
research workforce, community, and advisory boards; 2) recruit, mentor, and sponsor diverse and inclusive
cohorts of scholars into professional development programs to create future leaders of the UFHCC and the
cancer research community; 3) leverage and strengthen institutional infrastructure and resources to ensure the
success of URMs, women, and other URGs in the cancer workforce and leadership; and 4) develop processes
and metrics to evaluate progress and ensure continuous improvement on institutional culture. The PED will build
on a foundation developed by CaRTEC and the CaRE2 Health Equity Center, the latter in partnership with Norris-
USC and Florida A&M University (a Historically Black University in the catchment area). This includes pre-
collegiate, undergraduate, and postbaccalaureate programs for populations underrepresented in the cancer
research workforce, including URMs. The UFHCC PED will develop programs and activities that increase the
diversity of the cancer research community through UFHCC initiated training, recruitment, retention, and
promotion. This includes new applications for URG-focused R25 and T32 grants. The UFHCC PED augments
recruitment of graduate and medical students to cancer specific programs by leveraging affinity groups, recruiting
faculty using inclusive processes to identify a diverse talent pool, and creation of communities, structured
mentorship, and sponsorship to enhance faculty development and retention. Lastly, PED and CaRTEC will
develop an Emerging Leaders Program to increase the diversity of the next generation of UFHCC leaders."
10850887,"CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES (CCPS): ABSTRACT
The Cancer Control and Population Sciences (CCPS) program at the University of Florida Health Cancer Center
(UFHCC) is led by Braithwaite and Krieger. The goal of the CCPS program is to reduce the cancer burden in
rural North Central Florida and beyond. The CCPS program’s specific aims are to: 1) Elucidate molecular,
behavioral, social, environmental, and other risk factors in cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and
evaluate primary and secondary cancer prevention interventions; and 3) Address the unique needs of cancer
survivors. Research activities are unified by 5 CCPS priorities that address the cancer burden of the catchment
area (CA): a) social determinants and cancer disparities; b) smoking and other tobacco use; c) molecular and
imaging markers; d) obesity, energy balance, and cancer; and e) the intersection of cancer and aging. To capture
the research strengths at the University of Florida (UF), CCPS assembled 48 members drawing a wide range of
expertise from 20 departments and 10 colleges. The organization of CCPS has a culture of multidisciplinary
collaboration with other UFHCC programs, shared resources, Community Outreach and Engagement (COE),
and Cancer Research Training and Education, enabling research excellence across the translational spectrum.
Since 2016, key achievements of the program include evaluating the performance of breast cancer screening in
older women, developing novel cancer communication strategies to increase colorectal cancer screening and
HPV vaccine uptake, performing studies that informed raising the age of tobacco sale in Florida, developing
radiation dosing tools to prevent harmful effects of diagnostic and therapeutic radiation, assessing Hepatitis C
treatments that reduce liver cancer risk, and developing digital patient-reported outcome tools. Since 2016,
program members published 1,114 cancer-relevant publications, ~7% with impact factors >10. CCPS members
enrolled 6,528 participants on interventional trials, including a pragmatic clinical trial examining patient-reported
outcomes following proton therapy among older men with prostate cancer, and 13,064 participants on non-
interventional studies. Through our efforts, robust collaboration is evident with 40% intra-programmatic, 29%
inter-programmatic, and 73% multi-institutional publications. CCPS members hold >$11.5M in external peer-
reviewed funding (up 48% since 2019), with >$3.7M from the NCI. CCPS mentors trained 186 graduate students
and 30 postdocs, of whom 66% are women and 19% underrepresented minorities (URM). CCPS future directions
are aligned with the UFHCC strategic plan, Momentum 2027, seeking further recruitments, scientific progress,
and impact building on the research expertise of the UFHCC and community partnerships. Driven by the CA
needs, future development includes expansion of tobacco control research, cancer communication, and
screening. CCPS will address the intersectional problems of aging and cancer, obesity and cancer, and the
impact of social determinants on cancer outcomes. In partnership with COE, CCPS will disseminate research
findings and best practices across the CA and beyond."
10850891,"CANCER THERAPEUTICS AND HOST RESPONSE (CTHR) PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) CTHR program integrates investigators with expertise
in microbiome, immunology, cancer biology, bioengineering, medicinal chemistry, and clinical trial development
to advance cancer treatment. CTHR is led by Sayour, an expert in immuno-oncology, and Jobin, an authority
on microbiome and cancer. CTHR is comprised of 62 members from 19 departments in 7 colleges, including 19
members recruited since 2016. CTHR members support the scientific aims to 1) define cancer immunobiology
and develop novel immunotherapies; 2) elucidate microbiome function in cancer development and therapeutics;
3) identify new targeted therapies engaging key cancer pathways; and, 4) translate discoveries to new clinical
trials. Key progress from the program included i) investments in cGMP facilities enabled pan-cancer platforms
for multiple novel immunotherapies; ii) initiation of a first-in-human mRNA-nanoparticle vaccine trial
(NCT04573140); iii) FDA IND approval for an innovative CAR-T against CD70+ malignancies; iv) novel finding
that microbiome from immunotherapeutic-responsive non-small cell lung cancer patients confers responsiveness
in preclinical lung models; and, v) discovery and development of new therapeutic compounds including complex
cytotoxic molecules from sea life and rationally designed PROTACs against BCL-XL, now in a phase I clinical
trial. The program translates basic discoveries to the clinic through the IIT Think Tank. CTHR has a peer-
reviewed funding base of >$9.1M/yr in direct costs (up 23% since 2019), representing 72 peer-reviewed projects,
of which 27 are from NCI ($3.2M direct costs), including 13 MPI awards. Since 2016, CTHR members generated
1,276 cancer-relevant publications, 24% with impact factors >10, of which 38% are intra-programmatic, 32%
inter-programmatic, and 67% multi-institutional. The percent of clinicians publishing collaboratively with basic or
population scientists nearly doubled to 59%. CTHR members had 39 new patents awarded. Since 2016, CTHR
launched 41 institutional interventional trials, including 39 treatment trials. Between 2016 and 2021, 15 research
findings from UFHCC members were translated into clinical trials (13 at UF) through laboratory scientist/clinical
investigator collaborations. Since 2016, CTHR clinical investigators enrolled 1,199 patients on treatment trials,
and in 2021 enrolled 174 of the 299 patients on UFHCC treatment trials. To accelerate clinical research, since
2019, UFHCC recruited 8 clinical investigators to CTHR with protected time and resources to develop IITs. CTHR
mentors trained 194 graduate students and 92 postdoctoral trainees, of whom 44% were women; ~10%
underrepresented minorities (URM). There were 25 trainees (12 women; 5 URMs) supported by NIH training
grants. CTHR leadership and members are committed to the plan to enhance diversity through recruitment in
partnership with the Associate Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Future plans, aligned with the UFHCC
strategic plan, include recruitment in translational immunology, microbiome and carcinogenesis, P01 grants (e.g.,
brain, microbiome, lung), and targeted recruitment of clinical investigators (e.g., women's, lung, blood)."
10850898,"MECHANISMS OF ONCOGENESIS PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The objectives of the Mechanisms of Oncogenesis (MOO) program are to elucidate the deregulated genetic and
epigenetic events that drive tumor initiation and progression and to identify cancer relevant therapeutic targets.
MOO is led by Wu, an expert in cancer signaling and mouse tumor models, and Renne, an expert in tumor
virology and non-coding RNAs. MOO is a multidisciplinary group of 38 members, representing 19 departments
from 5 colleges. Since 2016, 20 faculty, including 14 early stage investigators (ESIs) were recruited since 2016.
The scientific aims of MOO are to: 1) elucidate the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations in cancer; 2) define
the role of regulatory RNAs in oncogenesis; and, 3) translate MOO discoveries into novel therapeutic
approaches. In alignment with Aim 3, Guryanova discovered that DNMT3A mutant AML was highly sensitive to
low dose cytarabine, which has led to the development of a treatment trial in collaboration with Al-Mansour
(CTHR), fostered by the ADs for Basic Sciences and Clinical Research and the IIT Think Tank. MOO has a peer-
reviewed funding base of >$9M/yr in direct costs (increased >10% since 2019), representing 59 peer-reviewed
projects of which 24 are from NCI ($3.8M direct costs), including an NCI P01, NIH, and other peer-reviewed
sources. Since 2019, 10 new grants have been awarded to newly recruited ESIs. MOO cultivates intra- and inter-
programmatic interactions through working group focused meetings (Epigenetics, Tumor Virology, and Lung
Cancer, a catchment area priority), seminars, and annual program retreats. These interactions led to 11 active
multi-PI peer-reviewed grants and a multi-institutional NCI P01. The success of MOO collaborations is also
demonstrated by 762 cancer-related publications since 2016, 20% with impact factors >10. Moreover, 19% of
publications are inter-programmatic, 23% are intra-programmatic, and 74% are multi-institutional. MOO
members were also granted 36 new patents. MOO mentors trained 162 graduate students and 71 postdocs,
comprised of 45% women and 10% underrepresented minorities (URM). There were 14 trainees (9 women; 3
URM) supported by NIH training grants. Wu serves as the program liaison to community outreach and
engagement (COE). She and Renne convey the impact of MOO research to community members and, in return,
learn about their needs. Renne, working with COE, co-developed the UFHCC cancer curriculum for Citizen
Scientists. MOO leadership and members are committed to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion through
participation in recruitment of trainees and faculty, in coordination with and guidance from the AD for Diversity,
Equity, and Inclusion. Future goals, in alignment with the strategic plan, Momentum 2027, will be focused on
paradigm shifting basic discovery and identification of therapeutic targets with the goal of clinical translation with
CTHR and CCPS members to address the cancer burden in the CA. MOO will enhance research in the areas of
lung cancer and RNA biology. UFHCC will monitor success based on collaborative publications, new
programmatic and MPI grants, and MOO discoveries translated into the clinic."
10850904,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The goal of the UFHCC of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is to reduce the cancer burden and
promote health equity in our catchment area (CA) and beyond. The COE office has 16 staff who form
partnerships with the community and scientists, conduct outreach, and facilitate implementation of evidence-
based cancer risk reduction and screening to address CA needs and disparities. The COE aims are to: 1) assess
and monitor CA cancer burden and disparities using linked clinical, social determinants of health, and community
member reported data; 2) engage the community as partners in adopting evidence-based strategies for cancer
prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship through outreach and education; 3) enhance the impact of
UFHCC research on the CA by involving the community in research agenda setting, aligning research with the
CA cancer burden, linking UFHCC scientists to the community, and facilitating access to interventional trials,
particularly for those traditionally underrepresented; and, 4) engage faculty, trainees, and the community in
advocacy and policy development. The CA of 23 counties accounts for 77% of UFHCC cases. Every county is
a medically underserved area and/or population, and roughly half have persistent poverty. Therefore, COE
further characterized the CA by census tract socioeconomic vulnerability (SEV) to inform programmatic
prioritization. The CA has higher cancer overall incidence and mortality rates than the state or the U.S. The
greatest mortality burden is observed for tobacco-related cancers, colorectal, and HPV-related cancers in those
residing in high SEV and persistent poverty census tracts. The CA has high rates of individuals who are
uninsured, current smokers, and adults ≥65 years along with low educational attainment and cancer screening
rates, relative to Florida and the U.S. Using these data and Community Advisory Board recommendations, COE
focused on high priority cancers, (e.g., tobacco-related, HPV-related, colorectal), with an emphasis on increasing
the uptake of cervical and colorectal cancer screening and reducing cancer risks (e.g., tobacco use, sun
exposure, lack of HPV vaccination). Since 2020, >1,000 women received education about cervical and colorectal
cancer screening and 281 were navigated to mobile outreach clinics for Pap and HPV self-tests. Over 350 skin
cancer prevention kits were distributed to Florida farmworkers. After a delay due to COVID-19, COE began
linking cancer patients to the Money Matters Program, which provides financial counseling and linkage to
community resources. COE works with liaisons from each UFHCC program to engage researchers in addressing
the cancer burden of the CA and links members to the community through the 1) UFHCC Citizen Scientists; 2)
OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium; and 3) community groups, such as the Project CONTINUITY Steering
Committee. COE future plans are to: expand Project CONTINUITY to 10 additional communities with an
increased focus on lung cancer screening, enhance participation of underrepresented individuals in treatment
trials, and engage older adults in cancer survivorship education and research."
10850910,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: ABSTRACT
Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds are critical to fulfill the mission of the University of
Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC). Developmental Funds foster innovative research and strategic
recruitment aligned with the Center's strategic initiatives. Since 2016, the UFHCC has collaborated across the
University of Florida in the internal and external recruitment of 58 new UFHCC members (45 new to UF), of
which 39 (67%) are early-stage investigators (ESIs), 26 (45%) are women, and 10 (17%) are underrepresented
minorities. Faculty were recruited into 8 of the colleges that contribute members to the UFHCC. Of these recruits,
20 are members of Mechanisms of Oncogenesis, 19 are members of Cancer Therapeutics and Host Response,
and 19 are in Cancer Control and Population Sciences, showing even distribution across the programs. UFHCC
committed a total of $29.9M in start-up support for all recruitment, with $14.4M expended to date. These new
UFHCC members have already made significant contributions to the center in terms of collaborative
programmatic and multi-institutional research, publications, and interventional clinical trials. Importantly, since
joining UF, these new members have obtained 56 new peer-reviewed extramural grants totaling $39M (direct
costs), of which $14.8M (~38%) is from NCI. The total extramural funding, including transferred grants, attributed
to these recruits is $52.4M (direct costs), with $24.2M (46%) awarded by the NCI. The return on investment on
UFHCC recruitment expenses to date relative to all extramural peer-reviewed funding (direct costs) attributed to
recruits is >3.6:1. Since 2016, the UFHCC Pilot and Exploratory Study Proposals received 183 proposals for
review, with 33% approved for funding. Outcomes of projects awarded between 2016 and 2020, for which
enough time had passed to assess impact ($3M of pilot funding), included 159 publications and $20M (direct
costs, for all award years) in new extramural peer-reviewed funding, a return on investment ratio of ~6.7:1. Since
2016, Developmental Funds have assisted in the expansion of the UFHCC funding portfolio. With the new
recruits, total cancer-relevant funding increased from $21M in 2016 to $32.6M in 2021 (up 55%) direct costs,
NCI funding increasing from $9.6M to $13.2M (up 37%) direct costs. The overall research productivity of the
UFHCC increased from 369 publications in 2016 to 641 in 2021 (up 1.7-fold). The number of publications with
impact ≥10 went from 59 in 2016 to 95 in 2021. Since 2016, Developmental Funds also supported the recruitment
of 18 members who developed novel interventional IITs. In 2016, accruals to IITs accounted for 70% of
participants enrolled in trials (23% of treatment accruals). In 2021, IIT accruals accounted for 91% of enrollments
(59% of treatment). Interventional trial accruals increased from 515 in 2016 to 1,748 in 2021 (up 3.4-fold).
Treatment accruals increased from 138 in 2016 to 299 in 2021 (up 2.2-fold). Developmental funds will be used
for pilot grants to encourage innovative transdisciplinary science on cancers relevant to the catchment area, and
recruitment of highly qualified and diverse new members across the 3 research programs."
10850914,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) members benefit from access to the UFHCC-managed
Biostatistics and Quantitative Sciences Shared Resource (BQS-SR) and the institutionally-managed Flow
Cytometry and Confocal Microscopy Shared Resource (CYT-SR) and Next Generation Sequencing Shared
Resource (NGS-SR). With nearly 25 years of experience in shared resource management, Madore (ZY),
UFHCC Associate Director for Shared Resources and UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research
Associate Director for Science, manages the shared resources (SR) to drive novel discoveries through member
access to cost-effective, leading-edge instrumentation, and quantitative science expertise. The SR Management
goals are to: 1) identify and evaluate SR needs of the membership to support existing centralized SRs and
develop new SRs; 2) establish standard operating procedures, facilitate regular staff training, and assure quality
control processes for rigor and reproducibility of research; 3) leverage existing institutional resources to create
and expand services and continuously evaluate new technologies to meet member needs; 4) monitor
effectiveness of SRs through membership surveys and advisory oversight groups; 5) establish and maintain
policies for optimal SR capacity and maximal access; and 6) centralize fiscal planning and billing management
systems in compliance with institutional and federal policies. SR funding comes from an established chargeback
system, institutional resources, direct grant support, and strategic partnerships with the UF Office of Research
and UF Colleges. A member of the UFHCC Executive Committee, Madore chairs the UFHCC SR Oversight
Committee that supervises SR Management in alignment with the UFHCC Strategic Plan. Scientific Advisory
Groups for each SR provide faculty-guided feedback and advice. Since 2016, UF institutional commitment for
SRs includes salary subsidy for 9 staff members in the institutionally-managed CYT and NGS-SRs and $1.5M
in capital equipment investment. Leveraging this continuous support, UFHCC contributed $1.7M for
instrumentation acquisitions and enhancements in CYT-SR and NGS-SR. UFHCC recruited 6 new
biostatisticians and bioinformaticians in the BQS-SR (~$1.4M investment to date) and supported a PhD
immunologist in the CYT-SR to perform flow-based immunophenotyping for a first-in-human therapeutic tumor
RNA vaccine trial. Since 2016, the BQS-SR, CYT-SR, and NGS-SR contributed to 574 cancer-focused
publications (19% with impact factors ≥10) and supported $117.4M (direct costs, all years) in peer-reviewed
grants. Since 2016, 222 UFHCC users accessed BQS-SR, 78 utilized CYT-SR, and 54 utilized NGS-SR. Future
plans, in alignment with the UFHCC strategic plan, Momentum 2027, include expanding the SR services
portfolio through acquisition of new instrumentation and technology (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, super high-
resolution microscopy), supporting BQS-SR in implementing artificial intelligence/machine learning methods,
and leading the formation of two UFHCC developing SRs in response to membership needs."
10850918,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING & EVALUATION: ABSTRACT
The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) has established a highly effective leadership team and
structure for planning and evaluation. UFHCC Director, Licht (MOO), assembled the team in 2016, shortly after
his appointment as director in late 2015. The UFHCC Executive Committee (EC) consists of the Director, along
with the Deputy and Associate Directors. The EC and Licht are the UFHCC's policy-making body, responsible
for establishing the vision for the center and ensuring that UFHCC meets its strategic goals to enhance cancer
research that impacts the population of its catchment area (CA) of North Central Florida. The EC leads strategic
planning, establishes policies, and reviews progress toward the goals of the UFHCC strategic plan. Under the
leadership of Licht, the EC developed and continually assesses the UFHCC research programs, shared
resources, and membership. The EC utilizes internal and external advice to effectively plan and evaluate new
programmatic initiatives, faculty recruitment, shared resources, and foster team science and opportunities to
advance the UFHCC's progress. In 2016, with input from internal and external stakeholders, the EC developed
its first strategic plan, Vision 2022, to provide a roadmap to develop the cancer center in the framework of the
NCI Cancer Centers Program. The plan, with advice from the External Advisory Board, guided the leadership to
develop and enhance cancer research at UF, creating a collaborative culture inclusive of the entire university,
investing requisite resources to support 3 research programs and 3 shared resources, reorganize and expand
clinical trial capabilities, develop strategies for community outreach with the advice of the community advisory
board, formulate an inclusive research career enhancement program, and develop mechanisms to bring UF
discovery into the clinic. Accomplishments include expansion of clinical, basic, and population-based research
through the recruitment of 58 new UFHCC members (45 external), including 45% women and 17% URM. Since
2016, NCI funding increased from $9.6M to $13.2M/yr of direct costs (up 37%), peer reviewed funding from
$21M to $32.6M/yr of direct costs (up 55%), and total funding $25M to $40M/yr of direct costs (up 60%).
Publication output increased from 369 in 2016 to 641 in 2021 (up 1.7-fold), yielding 506 high impact (IF >10)
publications over the reporting period. Accruals to all interventional trials increased from 515 to 1,748 (up 3.4-
fold), with treatment trial accruals increasing from 138 to 299 (up 2.2-fold) now representing ~9% of reportable
cases. IIT accrual accounted for 91% of all enrollments and 59% of treatment enrollments and included
translation of multiple UFHCC discoveries into the clinic. Having met the goals of Vision 2022, a new strategic
plan, Momentum 2027, was created building around 4 foundational pillars guiding all UFHCC activities. These
include: 1) conduct transdisciplinary research; 2) translate scientific advances; 3) lessen the CA cancer burden;
and, 4) grow a prepared, diverse workforce. This plan integrates the strategic initiatives of the research programs,
shared resources, and the various components, and will guide our priorities and actions during the next 5 years."
10850923,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: ABSTRACT
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) component of the University of Florida Health Cancer
Center (UFHCC) provides comprehensive resources and quality control for the efficient conduct of clinical cancer
research relevant to our catchment area (CA), inclusive of efforts to address minorities, women, and individuals
across the lifespan. The CPDM is overseen by George (CTHR), Associate Director for Clinical Research, and
implemented by the UFHCC Clinical Research Office (CRO). UFHCC leadership and staff support clinical
research addressing the needs of the UFHCC CA, with an emphasis on access to novel therapies arising from
UFHCC research programs. The CRO facilitates the efficient conduct of high-quality clinical research through
centralized management, reporting, and quality assurance functions. The CRO offers UFHCC investigators the
infrastructure to manage a full range of investigator-initiated trials (IITs), external peer-reviewed, NCI sponsored,
and industry trials, while also facilitating and tracking non-interventional studies. The CRO meets the needs of
UFHCC members by supporting protocol development, activation, regulatory compliance, participant screening
and recruitment, investigational pharmacy interactions, clinical research coordination, data abstraction,
information dissemination, and interactions with sponsors and regulatory bodies. The CRO also provides
centralized education and training to augment data integrity and participant safety. The office administers the
UFHCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan that delineates the structure and responsibilities of the Data Integrity
and Safety Committee which reviews and assures the safe conduct of UFHCC clinical research. The UFHCC
research portfolio emphasizes IITs, NCI sponsored studies, and other early phase treatment trials focusing on
refractory diseases, to address the disproportionate number of advanced cancer diagnoses in our CA. From
2016 to 2021, the number of active UFHCC IITs increased by 63% from 24 to 39 while the number of actively
accruing interventional protocols of all types, particularly treatment, screening, and supportive care, rose by 19%
from 162 to 192. Consistent with UFHCC priorities to support NCI sponsored trials, UF is now a voting main
member of NRG Oncology, a full member of the Children's Oncology Group, and currently the only non-NCI-
Designated center member of the ETCTN. In 2016, UFHCC accrued 515 participants to interventional cancer-
relevant clinical trials with 70% of those participants enrolling to IITs (23% on treatment IITs). With an increased
emphasis on interventional protocols and more effective patient screening, year over year increases in
enrollment occurred leading up to the pandemic. In 2021, there were 1,748 (up 3.4-fold since 2016) interventional
accruals (91% on UFHCC IITs), including 299 treatment accruals (up 2.2-fold since 2016; 59% on IITs). While
there were fewer treatment accruals due to the significant impact of COVID-19 in Florida, the UFHCC anticipates
recovery of treatment accruals with expansion of the clinical trial portfolio, enhanced participant screening
resources, and strengthened collaboration with the Office of Community Outreach and Engagement."
10850927,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: ABSTRACT
The University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is
responsible for scientific evaluation, prioritization, and monitoring of all cancer-relevant clinical research
conducted by the UFHCC. The overall goal of the PRMS is to ensure that the clinical research portfolio consists
of impactful and scientifically sound studies aligned with the UFHCC strategic vision. All PRMS activities are
coordinated by the UFHCC Clinical Research Office. UFHCC uses a 2-stage process consisting of Disease Site
Group (DSG) and Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee (SRMC) reviews. The DSGs provide an
integrated, multidisciplinary approach to guide the selection and endorsement of high-quality cancer clinical
trials, while the SRMC reviews research studies for scientific merit, including study design, methodology,
statistical analysis plan, accrual goal expectations, procedures to ensure participant safety, and institutional
priority. A feasibility assessment is performed for all interventional studies to confirm there are a sufficient number
of potential participants and adequate clinical resources. To facilitate mission alignment, the University of Florida
mandates that all cancer-relevant research protocols must be reviewed and approved by the SRMC prior to
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Prior to SRMC submission, all interventional trials are reviewed by
the appropriate DSG for scientific and clinical interest and relevance to the UFHCC catchment area. The latter
is verified by the Director of the Office of Community Outreach and Engagement, who serves as a member of
the SRMC. The SRMC focuses on scientific merit and study progress, and its function does not overlap with that
of the IRB, whose jurisdiction is primarily participant safety. SRMC prioritizes trials competing for UFHCC
resources or participants and has final authority on study approval/termination, without appeal. The SRMC
conducts ongoing reviews of all active interventional clinical trials to ensure they are making sufficient scientific
progress. The SRMC closes trials for inadequate accrual, loss of scientific merit, or protocol violations that
compromise participant safety or the scientific integrity of a study. SRMC members are multidisciplinary to ensure
a fair, critical review of proposed cancer clinical studies. Membership includes faculty and staff with expertise in
clinical investigation, biostatistics, research pharmacy, clinical care, nursing, laboratory, biobehavioral and
population science, and Citizen Scientists. In 2021, DSGs considered 238 new clinical research studies,
ultimately bringing 86 (36%) to the SRMC, of which 53 were approved, 29 were approved with stipulations, and
4 were tabled. None were disapproved, due largely to rigor of the DSG review process. In 2021, the SRMC also
completed 66 protocol amendment reviews and 131 continuation reviews. The continuation reviews resulted in
76 approvals, 34 probationary approvals, and 21 terminations. Most probationary approvals were related to
challenges with enrollment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Future directions include shortening timelines
for SRMC approval, paperless documentation, and optimization of catchment area impact."

science to ensure scientific rigor in cancer research. The BQS-SR meets this objective by providing
interdisciplinary collaborative support to members across the 3 research programs at all stages of their research.
BQS-SR assists with experimental design, sample size and power evaluation, randomization and stratification
procedures, study execution, data analysis, and publication of new findings in the understanding, prevention,
and treatment of cancer. The BQS-SR is directed by Lee (CCPS), with >20 years of experience as a member or
leader of a biostatistical shared resource at NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, with support from Unit Leaders for
bioinformatics and computational biology, clinical trials, and statistical genomics. BQS-SR is staffed by 12
personnel (a total of 7.5 UFHCC-supported FTE), comprised of 4 Biostatistics faculty, 1 Bioinformatics faculty, 5
Biostatistics staff scientists, and 2 Bioinformatics staff scientists. Additionally, BQS-SR serves as a liaison and
matchmaker between existing campus-wide specialized quantitative scientists and UFHCC members to support
specialized needs of externally funded cancer research projects. BQS-SR faculty are aligned to each of the
Research Programs and Disease Site Groups to ensure ready accessibility to UFHCC members. BQS-SR
promotes rigor and reproducibility by collaborating with and educating investigators, trainees, and research staff
through seminars, individual sessions, and short courses tailored to cancer researchers. BQS-SR ensures the
integrity of clinical research by participating in the IIT Think Tank, Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee
(SRMC), and the Data Integrity and Safety Committee (DISC). The BQS-SR advances quantitative science by
developing new methodologies including novel microbiome data analysis approaches and visualization for
single-cell RNA-Seq data. Since 2016, BQS-SR members supported 222 unique UFHCC users (138 with peer-
reviewed funding) through 286 grant submissions and reviewed 411 interventional clinical trial protocols through
the SRMC and DISC. Since reorganized by Lee in 2018, the BQS-SR has received 320 support requests from
113 unique UFHCC members, with ~34% related to grant proposals, 28% for IIT development, and 20% for data
analysis supporting peer-reviewed publications. BQS-SR members were co-authors on 340 cancer-relevant

10850934,"FLOW CYTOMETRY AND CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY SHARED RESOURCE (CYT-SR): ABSTRACT
CYT-SR provides University of Florida Health Cancer Center (UFHCC) members with cost-effective, state-of-
the-art flow cytometry and modern confocal microscopy expertise, instrumentation, and services to support their
research activities. The CYT-SR is an institutionally-managed shared resource (SR) that is supported by UFHCC
through a partnership with the UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR). It is co-located
within the Cancer & Genetics Research Complex and McKnight Brain Institute, providing convenient access for
UFHCC members. The CYT-SR has 4 staff with over 22 years combined experience including Kellish, the
Scientific Director, an immunologist with more than 7 years of experience in all aspects of flow analysis. Key
technologies available in the CYT-SR include multi-parameter flow cytometry, cell sorting, live cell imaging via
confocal microscopy, surface biomarker-based cancer and immune cell phenotyping, assessment of tissue and
cell morphology by confocal microscopy, and small particle and exosome analysis. During the recent COVID-19
pandemic, the CYT-SR was identified as an essential campus resource and remained open and accessible to
all users. Instrument reservations, equipment usage time, and technician-assisted activities are tracked by the
UFHCC and charged back via the CrossLab laboratory management system. Since 2016, the CYT-SR was
utilized by 78 unique UFHCC users (43 with peer-reviewed funding) accounting for ~24% of all users of the
facility. CYT-SR use by UFHCC members increased 5.3-fold from 900 hours in 2016 to 4,800 hours in 2021.
The CYT-SR supported more than 180 publications, with 24% having IF >10. Since the 2019 CCSG submission,
484 students, postdoctoral fellows, and technical staff from UFHCC member laboratories were trained on CYT-
SR instruments. Mechanisms of Oncogenesis and the Cancer Therapeutics and Host Response members
represent the majority of UFHCC users. The effectiveness of the CYT-SR in enhancing member research
productivity is assessed by annual surveys, feedback from the CYT-SR Scientific Advisory Group, and
recommendations from the SR Oversight Committee. Due to the rising demand for CYT-SR resources by
members, the UFHCC supported the purchase of a new Sony SP6800 Spectral Analyzer (2018), Cytoflex LX21
(2020), and a Becton Dickinson SYMPHONY A3 (2020). To support first-in-human RNA vaccine clinical trials,
UFHCC supported the recruitment of a PhD-level immunologist to the CYT-SR to perform flow-based
immunophenotyping. Future growth of the CYT-SR are in alignment with the UFHCC strategic plan, Momentum
2027, and user satisfaction surveys, and include upgrades such as an acquisition of a BD FACSYMPHONY S6
cell sorter, increasing capabilities and services in super high-resolution microscopy and single cell analysis, and
in collaboration with BQS-SR, expansion of advanced training in the application of biostatistics to cytometric
analysis."
10838594,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Scientific Premise and Prior Research: Puncture wounds, be they produced by accident, intent or medical
practice, e.g., surgery, can be a routine to major traumatic event. Moreover, drug aggravated bleeding is a major
limitation of current antiplatelet drugs that form a cornerstone of cardiovascular patient therapy and a potentially
major liability to any surgery. We contend that detailed structure understanding of the platelet centric responses
that occur within the actual puncture hole is essential to fill a void in prior research and yield an important
framework for the management traumatic injuries and common bleeding side effects.
Gap(s) in knowledge: Previous approaches to thrombus formation have focused mostly on examples in
which the exposed vascular matrix remains intact and therefore little to no bleeding occurs and have suffered
from the inability of 2P microscopy or SEM to assess platelet activation at the level of individual platelets.
From this circumscribed experimental perspective, a “Core and Shell” model of thrombus structure, i.e., a
horizontal core of matrix anchored, highly activated platelets covered by a shell of weakly activated platelets in
which signaling within the Core is thrombin-dependent and within the Shell is ADP/thromboxane-dependent
has emerged. We submit that this model may well be limited in its application to actual bleeding where the
wound is an open puncture hole.
Solution to problem: Taking alternate visualization approaches that determine the activation state of individual
platelets in 3D space, our Preliminary Studies have already yielded data redefining normal, bleeding cessation
as exemplified in a puncture wound model. Our data reveal a spatially dispersed, platelet activation pattern and
strong indications that initial steps in thrombus formation are dependent on the capture of platelet aggregates
that cap the hole from the outside rather than fill the hole. This has led us to formulate a new “Cap and Build”
paradigm. How both platelet-centric and coagulation factor cascade events can be integrated within the
paradigm is now an important question. To understand these multiple inputs through experimentation, we have
proposed Aims that focus first on signaling events, be they autocrine (platelet secretion, Specific Aim 1) or
exocrine (as inferred from the effects of anti-platelet drugs or DOACs, Specific Aim 2), and the importance of
platelet adhesion receptors (Specific Aim 3). We also propose to test how well the Cap and Build paradigm
apply to smaller, less traumatic injury."
10833565,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long term goal of this project is to understand the regulation and physiological roles of autophagy, a
process by which proteins, organelles and bulk cytoplasm are sequestered within autophagic vesicles and
delivered to the lysosome for degradation. This process plays several distinct, vital roles in the cell, acting to
recycle aged or damaged components, to provide a source of nutrients in response to starvation, and in some
cases to initiate cell death. These cellular functions underlie a growing appreciation for the impact of autophagy
on a broad range of human illnesses and on normal physiological processes such as aging. Fundamental
questions regarding autophagy remain to be addressed, including how autophagy initiation is regulated by
nutrients and other signals, how autophagic vesicles mature to become competent for degradation, and how
rates of autophagy are maintained at homeostatic levels optimal for cell survival. The exciting prospect of
harnessing autophagy as a therapeutic tool awaits better understanding of these basic principals.
The proposed studies will use genetic, biochemical and imaging-based approaches in the Drosophila system
to help define mechanisms of autophagy regulation in the context of in an intact organism. Our previous
studies identified a number of key targets and mechanisms through which the Target of Rapamycin (TOR)
pathway inhibits autophagy in response to favorable nutrient conditions. The current proposal seeks to
understand 1) how TOR signaling is integrated with other nutrient and developmental cues such as cAMP-
dependent protein kinase A to control the initial steps of autophagy induction; 2) to test hypotheses that
describe potential mechanisms by which TOR signaling controls the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes
and the subsequent acidification of the autolysosome; and 3) to decipher the feedback mechanisms that
provide homeostatic control limiting the rates and levels of autophagic activity.
Experiments in this proposal were selected for their likelihood of having a high impact on key questions
important to the field of autophagy. This proposal makes use of recently developed reagents including
knockouts of several autophagy-related (Atg) genes, in vivo markers of autophagic activity, and novel methods
of genetic manipulation in cell clones. Information gained from studies of autophagy in Drosophila will provide
an important whole-animal complement to mammalian cell culture-based studies."
10896925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sarcomas are an immunogenic tumor type replete with tumor antigen experienced CD8 tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs). Surprisingly, checkpoint therapy that targets programmed cell death protein 1 (a-PD-1) to
reinvigorate CD8 TILs is largely ineffective in sarcomas and has not gained FDA approval. CD8 TILs experience
stress, but the stress response has not been widely studied in CD8 TILs of cancer patients. Under acute stress,
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) protects cells. Under
chronic stress, PERK activates a pro-apoptotic response that induces cell death. We previously demonstrated
that PERK is detrimental to CD8 T cells in tumors. We now reveal robust preliminary data that indicate that the
chronic PERK axis governed by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and ER oxidoreductase 1 (ERO1a)
shapes CD8 TIL fate in mouse and human sarcomas and impairs response to a-PD-1 therapy. Our data are
intriguing given the role of PERK to protect cells under acute stress through attenuation of translation. Indeed,
we found that the tumor microenvironment is a form of acute stress that inhibits translation in CD8 T cells through
PERK. However, in vivo in the presence of tumor antigen, the chronic arm of the PERK response appears to
dictate PD-1+ CD8 TIL fate. This proposal will formally test that chronic targets ATF4 and ERO1a drive activation
and metabolic exhaustion in CD8 TILs that limit the efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy, while the acute PERK response
protects CD8 TILs under sarcoma microenvironment stress. To accomplish our aims we have developed unique
genetic mouse models to analyze the T cell-specific contributions of the chronic and acute phases of the stress
response to shape efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy in sarcomas. In Aim 1, we will use LckcreRosa26-ATF4loxtg mice
with T cell-specific overexpression of human ATF4 and CD8 TILs from sarcoma patients to determine the
contribution of ATF4 to drive activation and exhaustion in CD8 TILs and shape response to a-PD-1 therapy in
sarcomas. The results are expected to reframe and advance our understanding of T cell exhaustion in sarcomas.
In Aim 2 we have created unique ERO1a-/- mice to formally define how ERO1a affects CD8 TIL metabolic
exhaustion and response to a-PD-1 therapy and we will use CD8 TILs from sarcoma patients to study the
contribution of ERO1a to human TIL exhaustion. The results are expected to produce a robust molecular target
that holds fantastic potential to improve the efficacy of a-PD-1 therapy in cancer patients. In Aim 3 we will use
our LckcrePERKf/f mice and Eif2aS51A mutant mice to elucidate requirements of the acute stress response in CD8
TILs. The results are expected to shape the direction of drug development surrounding the ER stress response
in cancer immunotherapy. Successful completion of this proposal will identify radical new chronic ER stress
targets that undermine the widespread success of immunotherapy in sarcoma patients and establish a new
paradigm that informs drug development for all solid tumor cancer patients."
10800723,"Project Summary – Single-Cell Core
 Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revolutionized the field of antibody discovery. The
Single-Cell Core part of this proposal will utilize a variety of cutting-edge technologies to facilitate and support
the efforts of the two Projects. A critical advantage of our efforts for identifying C. difficile-specific antibodies is
our recently developed LIBRA-seq technology (LInking B-cell Receptor to Antigen specificity through
sequencing). LIBRA-seq is an innovative platform for antibody discovery and characterization of antigen-
specific antibody repertoires. Unlike other approaches for antibody discovery, LIBRA-seq is the first to enable
the simultaneous determination of B cell receptor sequence and antigen specificity for a large number of B
cells against a theoretically unlimited number of diverse antigens, at the single-cell level. LIBRA-seq therefore
provides a unique opportunity to include multiple different antigens as part of the screening library for targeted
and efficient discovery of antigen-specific antibodies against different targets on C. difficile.
 In parallel to our LIBRA-seq efforts that will be focused on utilizing individual C. difficile antigens, we will
also work toward the identification of C. difficile-specific B cells by using whole fluorescent bacteria for
fluorescent-activated cell sorting, followed by next-generation sequencing of paired heavy-light chains of the B
cell receptors of the bacterium-reactive sorted B cells. We will refer to this approach as BUG-seq. With BUG-
seq, we will be able to interrogate a broader repertoire of C. difficile-specific B cells that extends beyond the
specific antigens that will be utilized for the LIBRA-seq experiments. Indeed, the LIBRA-seq efforts will provide
a focused approach to identify C. difficile-specific B cells, while the BUG-seq efforts will cast a wide net for
capturing diverse antigen-specific antibodies.
 The utilization of both LIBRA-seq and BUG-seq will provide highly significant cutting-edge capabilities
as complementary approaches for the identification of C. difficile-specific antibodies. Overall, the work
proposed here will utilize a variety of techniques, bringing together microfluidics, next-generation sequencing,
protein science, and immunology, combined with computational data analysis.
 Together, these efforts will lead to unparalleled capabilities for understanding antibody responses to C.
difficile infection, and for identification of antibody therapeutic candidates against a wide range of epitopes and
antigens. The work in the Single-Cell Core is therefore highly significant for the proposed efforts for discovery
and characterization of C. difficile-specific antibodies, a fundamental goal for both Projects in this proposal."
10833059,"Title: Mechanisms of Compartmentalized cAMP Signaling
Project summary:
 The overall goal of the proposed research is to provide a mechanistic understanding about how cyclic
AMP (cAMP) regulates a variety of different cellular functions with exquisite specificity. As a ubiquitous second
messenger, cAMP regulates a variety of processes that are critical to cell physiology, such as cell growth,
proliferation, metabolism, survival and mobility. In pancreatic β cells, cAMP is produced in response to glucose
or hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and in turn modulates the Ca2+ signal, directly
influencing exocytotic insulin release as well as regulating gene expression, acting through its effector
molecules cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac). The
concept of “cAMP compartmentation”, wherein unique changes in second messenger levels and effector
activities occur in both space and time, was put forward to help understand the exquisite signaling specificity of
cAMP, yet the mechanisms underlying cAMP compartmentation remain elusive.
 In the previous funding period, we made a breakthrough discovery. We discovered that the PKA
regulatory subunit RIα undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and that these condensates are critical
for cAMP compartmentation by serving as a dynamic buffering system, and allowing PDEs to create cAMP
microdomains. This discovery was enabled by the development of a new class of fluorescent biosensors that
can be targeted to proteins at the endogenous level, allowing probing of signaling dynamics at the native
stoichiometry. We have also created a novel class of fluorescent biosensors that allow direct visualization of
PKA activities in superresolution and elucidated how our previously discovered oscillatory circuit is regulated
spatially by A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 79/150. Altogether we published 29 peer-reviewed journal articles
(with 4 additional manuscripts in revision). In the current proposal, building on these discoveries, we will test
our hypothesis that PKA RIα phase separation, by sequestering cAMP and the catalytic subunit of PKA,
enables compartmentalized cAMP signaling and allows cAMP to achieve high signaling specificity and
functional diversity in β cells. Specifically, we will develop novel molecular tools to interrogate the
spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP/PKA signaling in living cells, examine the impact of RIα phase separation
on cAMP/PKA signaling and determine the functional roles of RIα phase separation in β cells.
 Our proposed studies should lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and
functional roles of the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP/PKA signaling, particularly in the context of the
regulation of  cell functions. As aberrations in the cAMP signaling pathway are implicated in clinical conditions
such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, such an understanding should help identify sites of dysfunction in
type 2 diabetes and potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
10836432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rare genetic defects of the primary cilium can cause a number of phenotypically-overlapping Mendelian
syndromes, known as ciliopathies. Intriguingly, many ciliopathy patients show signs of impaired glucose
homeostasis, with accumulating evidence suggesting that insulin receptor must be specifically trafficked into the
cilium to initiate insulin-dependent signaling cascades. However, we do not yet know if variants in ciliary genes
increase an individual’s risk for diabetes more generally, nor do we understand the mechanisms by which ciliary
genes might affect insulin receptor signaling to cause pathology. The goal of this proposal is to fill this gap in our
knowledge using complementary bioinformatic and cell biologic approaches. My clinical and scientific expertise
in ciliary biology and human genetics, coupled with my exciting preliminary results, rigorous research plan, and
outstanding mentorship team, provide a solid foundation for this project. In completing the proposed work,
specifically with its focus on providing me additional training in the field of bioinformatics and in lab management,
I will be perfectly poised to begin my independent academic career as a physician scientist seeking to better
understand the genetics and biology of ciliary dysfunction in human disease. I have secured the complete support
of my institution, and will benefit greatly from the unparalleled resources and mentorship available at both the
University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia over the course of this award.
I hypothesize that variants in ciliary genes increase risk for diabetes by perturbing cell signaling pathways
essential to normal insulin signaling. My preliminary analyses in the UK and Penn Medicine Biobanks have
already identified numerous ciliary genes and variants significantly associated with glucose and hemoglobin A1c
levels, and demonstrate significant changes in ciliary gene expression in response to insulin. I will further
investigate these associations with two complementary sets of analyses. Specifically, I will (1) use bioinformatic
approaches in large patient datasets to identify and characterize ciliary genes and pathways that confer
increased risk for type 2 diabetes phenotypes and (2) validate these findings in cell models of disease, with a
specific focus on understanding how genetic variation in ciliary genes perturbs the ciliary transport and
downstream signaling of insulin receptor. Through the careful use of cell and molecular biologic approaches
including signaling assays, RNAseq, and live cell imaging, I will quantify differences in insulin receptor signaling
and ciliary transport of insulin receptor when individual ciliary candidate genes, identified in Aim 1, are knocked
down in cell models. The completion of the proposed work will advance our knowledge of cilium biology and
common disease genetics, open new avenues for patient risk assessment, and has the potential to identify novel
therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes. Additionally, the application of the methodology and paradigm
developed in this plan will undoubtedly help with the elucidation of multiple other common disease mechanisms
attributable to Mendelian disease genes and cellular processes both within and outside of the cilium."
10838462,"Community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections worldwide,
affecting at least 150 million people annually. When a patient suffers 3 UTIs within a 12-month period, the
infection is termed recurrent UTI (rUTI). rUTI severely diminishes quality of life and has become one of the most
difficult urologic diseases to manage in women. Rates of range from 19-36% in premenopausal women and
increasing to 50% in postmenopausal (PM) women. The higher incidence of rUTI in PM women compared to
premenopausal women suggests that the host environment plays a role in rUTI susceptibility. rUTI management
relies on antibiotic therapy but many front-line antibiotics have become ineffective due to widespread
antimicrobial resistance. To combat the increasing rates of antibiotic-refractory rUTI, new therapies must be
developed. A promising source of new rUTI therapies is the urinary microbiome, termed here the urobiome,
which has been recently identified as an important component of the urinary environment. A critical step in the
development of probiotic therapies is defining niche colonization and maintenance requirements. However, to
date, urobiome studies have been largely focused on compositional classification and have not identified nichespecific urobiome functions or metabolic requirements. Furthermore, the effect of rUTI and the hormonal
changes on urobiome composition and function has not been assessed in PM women.
 We have completed shotgun metagenomic sequencing (MGS) of urine from a cross-sectional cohort of PM
women. In this work we have discovered that urinary lactobacilli (Lb) abundance in women without rUTI was
associated with specific modalities of estrogen hormone therapy (EHT). Our functional analysis of the MGS data
revealed differential enrichment in central carbon metabolism pathways in the metagenomes of women with no
history of UTI versus women with active rUTI suggesting that urobiomes of healthy women are functionally
different than those with rUTI. We have assembled a multidisciplinary, collaborative team to conclusively fill
fundamental gaps in knowledge through the following specific aims: 1) Define the correlation between urinary
Lb abundance and estrogen concentration in PM women using EHT, 2) Define metabolic differences between
the urobiomes of healthy women and those with rUTI relevant to the urinary environment, and 3) Establish the
spatiotemporal dynamics of urobiome composition and function in healthy PM women and during rUTI. In
completing these aims, we will quantify excreted EHT metabolites and define their correlation with urinary Lb
abundance. We will define key, relevant metabolic differences between urobiomes and identify metabolite-taxa
associations related to rUTI. Finally, our longitudinal analysis of urinary metagenomes and metabolites in
matched patient samples will define the effect of EHT on urobiome dynamics in healthy PM women and during
rUTI. These findings will generate foundational knowledge of the function and spatiotemporal dynamics of the
urobiome of PM women necessary for the rational design of urobiome-targeted therapies for rUTI."
10821378,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute heart failure (HF) is highly morbid, lethal, and costly. It is a difficult diagnosis to make given its symptoms
and signs overlap with other cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. In the emergency department (ED),
misdiagnosis of acute HF is common and associated with adverse outcomes. Biomarker testing can facilitate
accurate diagnosis; however, natriuretic peptides (NP) are the only guideline recommend biomarker of HF for
diagnostic testing, and are better for ruling-out, rather than ruling-in, acute HF. Even with NP testing, in
contemporary clinical practice misdiagnosis of acute HF still occurs in 10 to 45% of patients presenting to the
ED with dyspnea. Clinical prediction models including multiple biomarkers hold promise for improving
diagnostic accuracy. The few prior studies investigating a multiple biomarker approach for diagnosing acute HF
were limited by constraint to highly correlated markers from known biologic pathways, relatively small sample
sizes, lack of inclusion of all a priori selected biomarkers into a single model, and absence of validation
cohorts. Our study design addresses these limitations. Recent advances in “omics” enable novel biomarker
discovery on a larger scale and investigations less “biased” by existing knowledge. Thus, our overarching
hypothesis is a multi-marker model incorporating novel proteins discovered with plasma proteomics improves
diagnostic accuracy for acute HF. In preliminary work, we performed a proof of concept study utilizing plasma
proteomics to discover a multi-marker panel of 21 biomarkers which improved diagnostic accuracy for acute
HF beyond current clinical practice using clinical data and NP levels. Our promising preliminary data motivate
broader discovery in a larger sample size with subsequent derivation and validation of a multi-marker model for
diagnosing acute HF in independent samples of adequate size. Our specific aims are to: 1) expand the
discovery cohort and refine the multi-marker panel of 21 biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy for acute
HF, 2) derive a model for diagnosing acute HF incorporating the 21-biomarker panel, 3) test performance of
the multi-marker model in a prospective validation cohort, and 4) assess the incremental value of the multi-
marker model for diagnosing acute HF. In aim 1, existing plasma samples from 989 patients will be used to
assay 925 proteins to discover a smaller set of novel biomarkers most strongly associated with an adjudicated
acute HF diagnosis. In aim 2, we will utilize an existing prospective observational cohort, EMROC-AHF, to
derive the multi-marker model in 1,000 patients who presented to the ED with acute dyspnea. In aim 3, from
four EDs in Detroit, MI and Nashville, TN we will prospectively recruit a new sample of 1,000 patients
presenting with acute dyspnea and adjudicate the presence of acute HF by cardiologist panel review. In aim 4,
we will compare our multi-marker model against the current clinical approach for diagnosing acute HF using
the cohorts for Aims 2 and 3. Given the burden of HF, the frequency of inaccurate diagnosis and its adverse
consequences, we will address a significant unmet need by improving diagnostic accuracy for acute HF."

National Library of Medicine (NNLM) to provide U.S. researchers, health professionals, public health
workforce, educators, and the public with equal access to biomedical and health information resources and
data. This will include: 1) using community-driven approaches to increase access to health information; 2)
working through libraries and other members to support a highly trained workforce in biomedical, health
information, and data science resources; and 3) continuously improving the development and implementation
of impactful NNLM programs. We will develop opportunities in the areas of training, funding, and engagement
for member libraries and other organizations to carry out regional and national programs. Region 4 will assess
and interpret the needs of current and potential audiences and engage with these communities to offer training
and funding opportunities, all of which will expand the reach and impact of the National Library of Medicine
(NLM). Region 4 will work with the other RMLs, Offices, Centers and the NNLM Evaluation Center to
cooperatively design, implement, and evaluate innovative approaches to serve the biomedical and health
information needs of researchers, health professionals, public health workforce, educators, and the public in
communities across the U.S., understanding that all communities require equal access to the highest level of
health information regardless of demographics. Our focus on engaging with libraries and other organizations
such as public health entities and community-based organizations, as well as establishing two-way
communications throughout Region 4 will enable increased outreach, education, and funding designed to
improve access to reliable health information and data. We believe that trust in NLM, NNLM, and RML
products and services can only be achieved when the communities served have an authentic and legitimate
voice in how these services are administered. Our proposal demonstrates a sustainable plan to listen to and
partner with current and future audiences throughout Region 4 and the nation to increase access to reliable
health information and improve health equity."

10817152,"Summary: Project 1
It is now commonly accepted that aphasia therapy in chronic stroke is effective for improving language
processing, and perhaps to a lesser extent, quality of life. Nevertheless, most persons with chronic aphasia in
the United States have very limited access to therapy. Although the reasons for this state of affairs are several,
two factors are particularly important: insufficient reimbursement for therapy services and lack of access to
local transportation to and from therapy. A way to tackle both of these problems is to provide aphasia therapy
at a lower cost and eliminate the need for transportation. Providing aphasia therapy via telemedicine (clinician
administered therapy across the internet) will provide cheaper therapy by eliminating the need for a physical
facility to provide services and by reducing the need for transportation to and from therapy for either the
clinician (home health) or the patient (outpatient clinic). The purpose of Project 1 is to conduct a phase II, non-
inferiority trial of telerehab for aphasia therapy (aphasia remote therapy; ART), which will be exclusively
administered by a speech-language pathologist. All participants (N=100) will be randomized to receive either
telerehab (ART) or in-clinic therapy (I-CT) using the same kind of therapy we are currently using in Project 1.
The outcome measure will focus on speech production and combines correct naming and correct words
produced per minute during discourse. The primary endpoint is change in the outcome measure at 6 months
compared to baseline. The non-inferiority margin will be set so that if ART leads to less than 50% improvement
than the improvement following I-CT, it will be considered inferior for therapy delivery. In addition to comparing
the difference in outcome for ART and I-CT, we will also explore factors that influence the efficacy of telerehab
for aphasia therapy. For this purpose, we use a theoretical framework that is typically used to study the
acceptance of and personal attitudes towards telemedicine. Moreover, we will test participants’ cognitive-
linguistic status and collect biographical information to study which participants may have difficulty with
telerehab and may be poor candidates in a future, phase III trial. If our trial finds that ART is non-inferior to I-
CT, it will provide strong motivation to proceed with a phase III trial on a therapy modality that could
significantly alter and improve access to aphasia therapy for a population that now is estimated to exceed 2
million individuals in North America.
In addition to conducting a very timely clinical trial on ART, the work proposed here will continue to expand our
database on aphasia therapy outcome that is being populated in the current phase of Project 1. Accordingly,
the synergy between the current and the proposed work in Project 1 will be maintained. Moreover, Project 1
will continue to provide data for Projects 3 and 4 to study brain health in relation to aphasia therapy outcome
and neuropsychological models of language, respectively."
10817159,"Project Summary (Project 2)
Aphasia, or language impairment, is among the most devastating problems after left hemisphere stroke,
because it can interfere with an individual’s social interactions, ability to return to work, and even simple daily
activities, such as returning email or answering the phone. Speech and language treatment (SLT) can be
helpful in restoring language function, but recovery is often incomplete. Recent studies indicate that motor and
cognitive recovery after stroke can be augmented with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). With
this proposal, we aim to evaluate the effect of an SSRI, escitalopram, given daily for 3 months after stroke, on
augmenting language recovery. We will compare the effects of escitalopram plus SLT to placebo plus SLT in a
double blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT). SLT will consist of “standard” language therapy for two
months, followed by a daily, computer-delivered naming therapy (CoDeNT) over 15 sessions beginning at two
months. We selected this SLT to enable us to compare the effects of escitalopram to the effect of transcranial
direct current stimulation (tDCS) versus sham with the same SLT, in our ongoing study of tDCS plus aphasia
treatment in subacute stroke. We will evaluate the effect of escitalopram on naming untrained objects (one of
the most common deficits in aphasia), and secondarily, its effects on morphosyntactic production, content and
efficiency of narrative speech, quality of life, and disability. We will evaluate the influence of treatment and
demographic variables, lesion volume, white matter disease, aphasia and stroke severity, and education on
outcome. Based on recent studies from the Center for the Study of Aphasia Recovery and from the literature,
we will also identify neural mechanisms that may mediate the effects of language recovery with treatment,
including the influence of abnormal polymorphisms in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. We
will also evaluate the effects of escitalopram on “functional connectivity” at rest (or correlations in activation
between regions of “the language network” in the brain versus other networks in the brain, such as the motor
network), comparing resting state functional connectivity MRI before any intervention and after escitalopram or
placebo with SLT. This aim may shed light on the mechanisms of how escitalopram affects language, and/or
how language recovers with or without medication, independently on the effects of escitalopram on depression.
We will test our hypotheses in a RCT, Escitalopram for Language Improvement in Subacute Aphasia (ELISA).
Neither the participant with aphasia nor the investigator will be unmasked until the end of the study. The long-
term aim of this study is to provide the basis for a Phase III randomized controlled trial of either escitalopram,
anodal-tDCS, or both with concurrent SLT for treatment of subacute aphasia. This study will help us determine
which intervention(s) is likely to augment SLT and allow us to select the best candidates for treatment in the
larger study."
10817163,"Abstract
 Language impairments can vary considerably between individuals with aphasia. Our neurobiological
models based on the stroke lesion can only partly explain the aphasic symptoms. We hypothesize that the
integrity of the residual brain tissue outside the stroke lesion is an important, but not yet fully appreciated,
determinant of aphasia severity and recovery.
 It is well recognized that cardiovascular risk factors lead to cumulative widespread brain damage
through small vessel disease (SVD). Outside the aphasia literature, SVD has been strongly associated with
poor cognitive reserve and reduced resiliency to various forms of neurological injury. Stroke survivors with
aphasia typically have cardiovascular risk factors and they commonly exhibit SVD. However, the impact of
SVD is not usually taken into account in our models of recovery, even though the residual brain tissue is
responsible for overcoming the loss of function. It follows that higher degrees of SVD outside the lesion may
lead to worse aphasic symptoms and less chances of recovery due to reduced capacity to compensate for the
stroke injury. Our goal is to directly test this hypothesis.
 We propose to evaluate how aphasia is shaped by the stroke lesion in combination with residual brain
integrity. Neuroimaging (brain MRI) is ideally suited to address this problem. SVD is composed of
microangiopathic ischemic changes and microhemorrhages. The ischemic changes from SVD can be
measured through white matter hyper intensities using T2-weighted and T2-FLAIR images, and the
microhemorrhages can be assessed using susceptibility-weighted images. SVD preferentially affects white
matter and diffusion MRI can provide additional measures of white matter microstructural integrity and their
relationship with the whole brain neuronal networks architecture (the brain connectome).
 Using our experience with post-stroke lesion symptom mapping, white matter and connectome imaging
we propose a comprehensive study of the neurobiology and impact of SVD in aphasia. Our project will build on
international guidelines for SVD assessment (The STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on
nEuroimaging - STRIVE) and it will develop an innovative multimodal machine learning approach to fully
assess brain integrity.
 Brain integrity and language measures will be assessed in the context of chronic (Project 1) and acute
(Project 2) aphasia recovery. The behavioral and linguistic assessments will be guided by Project 4. With the
neuroimaging core, we will develop and distribute a multimodal neuroimaging approach to quantify the severity
and location of SVD.
 Specific Aim 1 will longitudinally assess the independent impact of SVD, controlling for the brain lesion,
on acute and chronic symptoms, as well as acute and chronic language recovery. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate
the mechanisms by which SVD leads to language impairments by assessing the impact of SVD and stroke
lesions on connectome neural network architecture, loss of associative long-range white matter fibers and its
relationship with semantic, lexical-semantic, lexical-phonological, phonological/phonetic deficits."
10817175,"Summary (Clinical Core)
In speech-language or stroke rehabilitation literature, relatively little attention has been paid to threats to a
study’s validity that relate to correct implementation of treatment, and also assessment, procedures. These
threats can increase the chance of Type I or Type II error, or the additional error (“Type III”) of concluding
significance or nonsignificance when in fact the tests or the treatments were not correctly implemented.
Additionally, these threats can prevent causal inference. In the absence of fidelity monitoring, investigators are
unable to confidently determine whether or not results (significant or insignificant) were caused by the targeted
independent variable or due to other random factors introduced because the clinician “drifted” from the
protocol, or “contaminated” the protocol by adding or omitting elements. Lack of attention to implementation,
then, could be a contributor to the historically mixed results in aphasia treatment research emphasized by
Project 1 and Project 2. Most of the aims proposed by Fridriksson, Hillis, Bonilha, Rorden, and Hickok require
recruitment and retention of patients and collection of high quality data. High quality data necessitate that
assessors use prescribed administration procedures and raters adhere to prescribed scoring procedures.
Seven of twelve project aims rely upon treatment, and therapists that adhere to prescribed treatment
procedures. The assumption of the investigators is that clinical staff functioning as assessors, raters, and/or
therapists adhere to the study protocol. Efforts to optimize adherence to assessment and treatment
procedures, referred to as assessment and treatment fidelity, are critical to the proposed projects. The Clinical
Core will coordinate and activities designed to optimize fidelity, thereby guarding against threats to validity and
improving the power to detect effects for nearly every aim proposed.
To guard against threats to validity stemming from selection bias, attrition, or missing data points, the Clinical
Core will conduct training and monitoring activities related to recruitment, retention, and data collection and
management. To guard against threats to validity stemming from drift, cross-contamination, clinician-to-
clinician variability, or unblinding, the Clinical Core will conduct extensive training, initial and throughout the
study, and monitoring activities that will ensure that there is standardized training for all clinical staff, that
assessment and treatment was delivered as intended, and that there is evidence that treatment was received
as planned. As far as we can tell, these will be among the first studies in stroke or aphasia rehabilitation to: (1)
incorporate multiple-tier training programs for all study member staff, (2) monitor treatment fidelity through
several complementary methods, and (3) monitor assessment fidelity via adoption of established treatment
fidelity guidelines. Finally, the Clinical Core will also support the Projects by scoring behavioral data, both for
reliability measures and for blinded measures of outcome. Thus, the main goals of the Core are training the
study team, scoring and management of behavioral data, and optimizing adherence to the protocols."
10830271,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to improve risk-stratification for patients who present to the emergency department
(ED) with syncope (transient loss of consciousness), in order to better delineate which patients require
admission and which can be safely discharged home. Syncope and pre-syncope (the sensation of impending
loss of consciousness) are common reasons to present to the ED, representing over 1.3 million visits per year
in the United States.
Although syncope is most often benign, it can occasionally be caused by serious cardiopulmonary diseases
such as cardiac arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome, or pulmonary embolism. Despite thorough evaluation in
the ED, the cause of syncope remains unknown in over 50% of cases, which leads to a large number of
syncope patients being admitted for observation and/or further testing. These admissions to the hospital or
observation unit are low-yield, costly, and expose patients to the possibility of iatrogenic harm.
In response to this, two groups of researchers have developed distinct syncope risk-stratification tools: the US
Syncope Risk Score and the Canadian Syncope Risk Score. These scores use a combination of clinical,
electrocardiographic, and laboratory variables to predict the risk of serious clinical outcomes at 30 days. While
promising, these two risk scores require external validation prior to widespread clinical implementation. In Aim
1 of this proposal, we will prospectively collect clinical data on 1,600 ED patients with syncope/pre-syncope
and follow them for 30 days to validate the predictive accuracy of these two risk scores. In Aim 2, we will
assess the impact of implementing these scores by measuring their potential effect on healthcare utilization
and costs. Existing care will be used as the reference strategy and will be compared with a simple risk-based
clinical algorithm: Direct discharge for low risk patients (under 2% risk of serious outcome at 30 days), and
hospitalization for medium- and high-risk patients.
If validated and shown to safely reduce healthcare utilization, these syncope risk scores could play a major role
in improving emergency syncope care by reducing low-yield admissions and identifying patients who are
unsafe for discharge from the ED. This study, entitled PACES: Practical Approaches to Care in Emergency
Syncope, will help increase the quality and value of emergency care, and advance the field of syncope
research."
10833569,"Project Summary
Mitochondria control cell metabolism by converting nutrients into an electrochemical gradient of protons (H+)
across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to generate ATP, the currency of the cell, and heat (called
mitochondrial thermogenesis). A precise balance in the distribution of H+ between the two forms of energy
production, ATP and heat, defines the metabolic homeostasis of the cell. Brown fat and beige fat mitochondria
specialize in the production of heat via the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). However, even in other tissues,
mitochondrial thermogenesis accounts for 25% of total mitochondrial energy production and can therefore have
a considerable impact on the physiology of the entire body. Mitochondrial thermogenesis is not only essential for
maintaining core body temperature, it is also the process by which excess calories are burned to prevent diet-
induced obesity. In addition, it reduces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondria to
protect cells from oxidative damage. In addition, chemical uncouplers such as 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), which
are believed to increase H+ leak independently of proteins, are the most effective anti-obesity drugs to date.
Thus, mitochondrial thermogenesis is a powerful regulator of cellular metabolism, and a mechanistic
understanding of this fundamental process will help in the development of therapeutic strategies to
combat many pathologies associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including metabolic syndrome
and age-related disorders. Unfortunately, the precise molecular mechanisms that control the acute activation
of thermogenesis in the mitochondria are poorly defined. This lack of information is largely due to a dearth of
methods for direct measurement of H+ currents across the IMM. The development of a methodology based on
the patch-clamp technique allows for the first time the direct study of H+ leak through the IMM of each tissue and
the first biophysical characterization of mitochondrial transporters, such as UCP1 and the ADP/ATP transporter
(AAC), which are the mediators of this H+ leak. This unique approach now provides an unprecedented high-
resolution direct functional analysis of 1) the mitochondrial ion channels and transporters responsible for
mitochondrial thermogenesis and 2) the mechanisms of action of chemical uncouplers such as DNP. Using the
new mitochondrial patch-clamp assay combined with modern cellular and molecular techniques, this
research project will provide new insights into the mechanisms that control the thermogenic capacity of
the mitochondria and how they can be targeted for therapeutic purposes."
10844477,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT. There continues to be a fundamental gap in understanding how CRISPR-
based genome editors produce gene modifications in different human cells. A lack of understanding of why
various editors fail and why some succeed in creating desired gene edits - while retaining full cell and tissue
functionality - limits the use of genome editing tools. By observing genome editing in real-time within patient-
derived cells in vitro, I seek to understand the bottlenecks in performing genome editing on human cells with
precisely-controlled genome editor particles. Particles will be systematically assembled with various DNA, RNA,
and polymeric components and delivered to patient-derived cells and microtissues. In situ high content imaging
and analysis within customized cell substrates will monitor genome editing at multiple scales. The central
hypothesis is that new assemblies of CRISPR-Cas9 particles can probe different biological processes of
trafficking, DNA-double strand break formation, and DNA repair involved in the genome editing of human cells
and tissues, as well as downstream effects on biological processes involving cell cycle arrest and
morphogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested within patient-derived stem cells and tissues for both gene
disruption and correction. An overarching rationale for the proposed research is that an improved understanding
of fundamental biological processes involved with genome editing could enable the development of novel cell
therapies and gene therapies for future genomic and precision medicine. Guided by strong productivity in the
current early stage R35 award, I will pursue three research programs: 1) Assemble Cas9 particles to identify
chromatin structures within human cells that promote gene correction; 2) Assemble Cas9 particles to identify
delivery and DNA repair processes that promote gene correction within stem cells; and, 3) Assemble Cas9
particles to identify cell proliferative and tissue morphogenesis processes that promote gene correction of
diseased mutations in patient-derived microtissues. Under the first research program, editing will occur at target
genes that have variable chromatin structures within induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), differentiated
progeny, and with small-molecule treatment. Under the second and third research programs, genome editors
will be applied to gene-correct diseased mutations in iPSCs, and microtissues matured from them. The approach
is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it departs from the status quo by systematically changing
multiple components at a time using novel methods in patient-derived cells. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of how genome editing tools can be applied
for the generation of advanced therapeutics, ranging from targeted small molecules to cell/tissue therapies.
Ultimately, such knowledge would solidify the foundation for new translational projects involving genome editing."
10881651,"Our laboratory is focused on understanding how mitochondrial function contributes to health and
disease. As the major energy generating organelle of the cell dysfunction of mitochondria has been
implicated in debilitating diseases prevalent in the VA patient population. These include, neurodegenerative
diseases (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's), diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. Altered mitochondrial
metabolism can result in changed levels of tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle metabolites, (such as succinate or
fumarate), that act as signaling molecules to promote a pro-inflammatory state. This can lead to changes in
gene transcription, through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), stabilization of hypoxia-
inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), or the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) transcription pathway
that responds to pro-inflammatory stress. Our laboratory investigates the structure and function of two
essential members of the mitochondrial respiratory chain both of which reduce ubiquinone (CoQ10) used by
the oxidative phosphorylation system to generate energy. We study the function of Complex I
(NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) which is the largest membrane-bound component of the mitochondrion.
NADH generated by the TCA cycle is used by Complex I to reduce CoQ10 and this activity controls the
NADH/NAD+ ratio. The enzyme is regulated by a structural change near the membrane domain termed the
Active/De-Active (A/D) transition, which we first showed occurred in vivo. We also study succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH/Complex II) which is a membrane-bound heterotetramer of dual function. SDH
oxidizes succinate to fumarate in the TCA cycle while reducing CoQ10 for energy generation. Malfunction of
SDH results in accumulation of succinate in the cell which promotes inflammation. It has been shown that
inhibitors of SDH can have a positive effect in treating damage form ischemia/reperfusion in both stroke and
cardiac models. Our studies of SDH have shown how the reversible inhibitor malonate binds to the enzyme
and causes inhibition. We are now focused on understanding how we can regulate the activity and
structure of both Complexes I & II so that this information can be used to treat disease.
 One model we will use is to investigate how TCA cycle metabolites can be used to treat traumatic
brain injury (TBI) or stroke. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an approved drug for treating relapsing multiple
sclerosis and psoriasis and Dimethyl malonate (DMM) is a cell-permeable non-toxic compound which in
vivo can be used to inhibit SDH. We hypothesize that in the brain injury model that DMM will block
succinate accumulation following injury and prevent the signaling that produces ROS during
ischemia/reperfusion; thus, reducing inflammation, the severity of the injury, and enhance healing. We use
mouse models for these studies. We will also determine if the epigenetic modifier DMF can reduce the
inflammation caused by TBI thus lessening the severity of the injury and enhance neuro-regeneration.
 We were the first to determine the x-ray structure of SDH and have provided major insight into its
catalytic mechanism and function. How the enzyme complex is assembled, however, remains and area of
intense investigation. We are now studying the assembly of human Complex II using known human
assembly factors, needed for incorporation of redox cofactors necessary for function of the enzyme. It has
been shown that when assembly is compromised this can lead to tumor formation in humans. We have had
success expressing and analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the human structural subunits of SDH
expressed in bacterial models. Thus, for the first time the structure of these assembly intermediates will be
known. This information is needed to develop small molecule inhibitors/activators that can be used for
treatment of diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and control metabolite levels in cells."

Maintenance of muscle mass is known to be beneficial in the prevention of obesity and obesity-related diseases
such as diabetes and heart disease, in addition to promoting overall health of our aging population. Skeletal
muscle atrophy is associated with cancer (cachexia), heart failure, chronic corticosteroid use, paralysis or
denervation (disuse atrophy), aging, contributing to poor metabolic health, and increased mortality. Accordingly,
a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle maintenance, growth and
function is critical for human health.
We recently showed that, in skeletal muscle, SWELL1 is required for maintaining AKT-mTOR signaling, normal
muscle fiber size, exercise capacity, force generation, adiposity and systemic glycemia, thereby revealing a novel
role for a SWELL1-AKT-mTOR signaling axis in skeletal muscle physiology. Furthermore, our group now has
published and unpublished biochemical, patch-clamp and imaging evidence that SWELL1 channel
complexes are also expressed and functional in lysosomes (Lyso-SWELL1) – a notion also supported
by a recent unbiased CRISPR screen. Given that lysosomes are signaling hubs that integrate nutrient sensing
and AKT-mTOR signaling, we hypothesize that SWELL1-LRRC8 channels co-regulate plasma membrane
PI3K-AKT signaling and lysosome centered nutrient-mTOR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we combine
our unique reagents and expertise in SWELL1 signaling with the those of the Diwan (lysosomal signaling), Xu
(lysosomal patch-clamp), and Meyer (skeletal muscle physiology) laboratories. Our objective is to understand
the dual mechanisms of plasma membrane SWELL1 signaling and lysosomal SWELL1 (Lyso-SWELL1) nutrient
sensing in skeletal muscle and its contribution to skeletal muscle growth and function. The rationale for these
studies is that delineating the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle SWELL1-AKT-mTOR signaling will
advance our understanding of novel, fundamental mechano-signaling and nutrient sensing mechanisms that
regulate skeletal muscle growth and function. We propose the following AIMs:
· AIM#1: Delineate the mechanisms of plasma membrane versus lysosomal SWELL1 signaling to AKT-
 mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle cells. These studies will test a novel paradigm for cellular nutrient sensing
 by a lysosomal ion channel signaling complex in vitro, setting the stage for in vivo experiments.
· AIM#2: Examine the contribution of SWELL1 signaling to aerobic capacity, skeletal muscle growth, and
 force generation in vivo with training and with aging. These studies will define the contributions of SWELL1
 signaling to skeletal muscle growth and signaling in vivo, and with aging."

Chiari type I malformation (CM1), the herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum into the spinal
canal, is one of the most common pediatric neurological conditions, found in approximately 1 in 1000 individuals.
CM1 is characterized by the herniation of the cerebellum through the foramen magnum into the spinal canal,
often leading to syringomyelia (SM), a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal canal, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal
fluid flow, compression of the brainstem and numerous neurological symptoms. We now have identified some of
the first genetic causes of CM1 and have identified idiopathic macrocephaly as a major etiological subtype of
CM1. By identifying additional genetic factors underlying CM1 and CM1-related imaging biomarkers, we hope to
uncover additional CM1 subtypes and their genetic basis. Additionally, our goal is to understand the role of CM1-
associated genetic variation that we have already identified by modeling specific genetic variants in zebrafish to
determine what systems are affected (brain, spine, skull, ventricular system) that lead to the common outcome
of hindbrain displacement. Earlier and more accurate diagnoses for CM1 patients will have profound effects,
informing clinical decisions regarding who should undergo surgery (versus CSF shunting vs surgery+spinal
fusion vs observation, etc) and along what time frame."
10851989,"Metastatic disease accounts for >90% of cancer-related deaths worldwide, yet this phase of tumor progression
is the least biologically understood. The consequence of this lack of knowledge is that we do not have the
appropriate therapeutic arsenal to defeat metastatic cancer. New revelations for colorectal cancer point to shed
neoplastic cells into peripheral blood even from early stage tumors, suggesting this is why some early stage
tumors recur despite seemingly successful treatment. However, whether all early stage primary tumors shed
neoplastic cells, or if only subsets of more aggressive neoplastic cells garner ability to disseminate is not known.
This highlights the critical gap in knowledge of the mechanisms underlying neoplastic cell dissemination leading
to distant disease. Identifying the key features within the lifecycle of a disseminated tumor cell will unravel this
important step in tumor progression with potential to influence management of cancer care. Our study leverages
newly developed state-of-the-art phenotypic analyses of key attributes of a recently discovered neoplastic hybrid
cell in primary tumors and in peripheral blood, termed circulating hybrid cells (CHCs), supported by cutting-edge
computational analyses. Interestingly, CHCs harbor tumor-initiating properties implying that they have high
potential as effectors of metastatic tumor seeding. We will detail cells poised to disseminate from the primary
tumor into circulation and seed metastatic sites combining protein, multi-omic analyses and functional behavioral
analyses. A focus on a stage II and late stage colorectal cancer cohorts support analyses across the disease
axis, with an emphasis on stage II CRC patients with undetected micrometastases at the time of diagnoses.
Evaluation of the lifecycle of the hybrid cell from primary tumor to dissemination will provide biologic insight into
the metastatic process with great potential to impact the management and care of patients with cancer."
10839360,"Salmonellae are Enterobacteriaceae that cause a spectrum of diseases in humans and animals, including enteric (typhoid) fever and gastroenteritis. Typhoid fever caused primarily by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), results in a life-threatening systemic disease that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality annually worldwide. Approximately 5% of individuals infected with S. Typhi become chronic carriers with the gallbladder (GB) as the site of persistence. S. Typhi is a human- restricted pathogen, therefore asymptomatic carriers represent a critical reservoir for further spread of disease. We have demonstrated that gallstones (GSs) aid in the development and maintenance of GB carriage in a mouse model (utilizing S. Typhimurium, which causes a typhoid-fever like disease in mice) and in humans, serving as a substrate to which Salmonellae attach and form a protective biofilm. Thus, biofilm formation is a key step in the establishment of carriers. Traditional antibiotic therapies are usually incapable of clearing chronic S. Typhi infections, as the biofilm phenotype renders the bacteria tolerant to the mechanisms of these drugs. Thus, the identification of novel therapeutics capable of targeting S. Typhi biofilms is necessary in order to eliminate chronic carriage and eradicate the disease. Towards this end, our group has identified four small molecules and two antibodies capable of inhibiting and/or disrupting Salmonella biofilms in vitro. We advance two of the small molecules in this proposal, JG-1 and M4, that both inhibit and disrupt biofilms in vitro and reduce GB bacterial numbers in vivo. We hypothesize that the use of these anti-biofilm compounds in conjunction with an antibiotic will more effectively inhibit and disrupt Salmonella biofilms in vivo in our mouse model of chronic carriage when compared to the administration of antibiotic therapy alone. In Aim 1, we will assess the efficacy of these anti-biofilm compounds at preventing and treating chronic infection compared to traditional antibiotics alone by utilizing our established mouse model of typhoidal chronic carriage. We will also measure important pharmacokinetic and tolerability parameters of these compounds. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which these compounds antagonize Salmonella biofilms, in Aim 2 we will identify the specific bacterial target(s) of each compound by enriching for mutants exhibiting compound resistance and by performing direct pull-downs of targets from bacterial lysates. Structure activity relationships and derivatives with enhanced physiochemical and biological properties will be generated in Aim 3. In summary, we propose an investigation into the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of novel anti-biofilm compounds to prevent and treat chronic infections by typhoidal Salmonella. To our knowledge this study will be the first attempt (utilizing subject experts in anti-biofilm medicinal chemistry and Salmonella chronic infection) to specifically target Salmonella biofilm formation in vivo as a means of combating chronic carriage."

In seminal preclinical studies nearly 20 years ago, Robinson & Kolb [1, 2] demonstrated enduring
changes in synaptic (dendritic spine) density in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rodents following
behaviorally sensitizing regimens of cocaine. Their findings suggested a potentially important
pathophysiological mechanism – aberrant structural synaptic plasticity – whereby cocaine might produce
the chronic, recalcitrant behaviors (e.g., craving, compulsive use, and relapse) so seemingly ‘hard-wired’
in those suffering from the disorder.
Our group has developed a novel radiotracer, 11C-UCB-J, for imaging synaptic density (i.e., synaptic
vesicle glycoprotein type 2A or SV2A availability) in the living human brain using positron emission
tomography (PET) [3, 4]. . Pilot data collected under the Cutting Edge Basic Research Award
(CEBRA)/R21 mechanism are compelling, we believe, and provide the first translation support for: 1)
altered (i.e., lower) synaptic density in the mPFC of individuals with CUD that is both 2) positively
correlated with the frequency (days per month) of recent cocaine use, and 3) negatively correlated with
duration of cocaine abstinence (days since last use). Together, these data suggest a dynamic model of
synaptic plasticity in which SV2A availability is “normalized” by recurrent cocaine use, only to return to
abnormal (i.e., low) levels during periods of sustained drug abstinence.
The current R01 application proposes to replicate and extend these promising preliminary findings
and more definitively test the former model through two experimental aims: Aim 1) a larger cohort of
40 CUD and 40 matched HC subjects using a single-scan, between group design, and Aim 2) the same
40 CUD subjects using a longitudinal, two-scan (baseline/pre-abstinence vs. 3 weeks of in-hospital
abstinence) within-subject design.
If confirmed, the current study would have a potentially major impact, providing powerful clinical-
translational support for the aberrant synaptic plasticity hypothesis of CUD, advancing our
neurobiological understanding of the role of drug-induced changes in synaptic function in CUD, and
ultimately, encouraging the development of more effective treatments for CUD (e.g., those based
on synaptotrophic mechanisms)."
10881875,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that affects about 250,000 Americans with 17,700 new cases
annually costing upwards of $2 million each. There is very little that can be done to treat these patients that
improves their prospects for even partial recovery or the amelioration of symptoms that negatively impact their
quality of life. SCI research continues to advance, but bolder and more innovative breakthroughs are needed, if
the efforts are to translate into therapies that improve symptoms, alleviate pain, and restore functionality. As
highlighted by the NIH-hosted SCI-2020 meeting, a new generation of SCI researchers is desperately needed,
one that is thoroughly educated in all of the needed background and history of the field while also equipped to
bring new technologies and insights into the field through strong collaborative interactions with scientists from
other fields. Drexel University College of Medicine is home to the Marion Murray Spinal Cord Research Center,
which has over three decades of history advancing the SCI field while simultaneously educating and training
doctoral students to take the field forward. Within the Center is the Drexel SCI Training Program, which consists
of well-funded and vibrant investigators who study SCI from many different perspectives, and mentor trainees in
many different approaches. These include engineering, electrophysiology, cell transplantation, rehabilitation and
others. The center has extensive multidisciplinary collaborations with Drexel investigators from other fields, many
of whom are involved in the SCI Training Program. The Center is based within the Department of Neurobiology
and Anatomy, with the students affiliated with the Neuroscience Graduate Program. SCI students are exposed
to a multitude of training experiences, including but not limited to what the Neuroscience Graduate Program
offers, with flexibility that welcomes students from other graduate programs to transfer into the program in order
to conduct SCI-relevant research. The program has existed for over thirty years, with consistent success of the
students securing F31 funding to fund their senior years, and then achieving success in their careers after
completing the program. T32 funding for the program will enable expansion of the research and the number of
trainees, thus improving the prospects of SCI patients, for whom treatments have remained elusive for too long."
10830294,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Secretory and membrane proteins, which account for ~30% of all human proteins, are co-translationally
translocated across or inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These nascent polypeptides are folded
into functional proteins with the help of chaperones and folding enzymes in the ER. Defects in protein folding
lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the triggering of ER stress, which activates the unfolded
protein response (UPR). Of the three major UPR sensors, IRE1α is the most conserved ER-localized
transmembrane kinase/RNase that is activated through oligomerization/phosphorylation upon ER stress. Once
activated, IRE1α mediates the splicing of XBP1u mRNA to produce an active transcription factor, XBP1s,
which drives expression of UPR target genes to mitigate ER stress. Also, IRE1α promiscuously cleaves ER-
localized mRNAs through the regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway to reduce the burden of the
incoming protein load. Under chronic ER stress conditions, however, IRE1α switches from the pro-survival
mode to pro-apoptotic mode, resulting in cell death, which is associated with human diseases including, type 2
diabetes and cancer. Despite the physiological importance, the factors that control activation and inactivation
of IRE1α/XBP1 signaling remain unclear.
 We have recently discovered that IRE1α forms a complex with the Sec61/Sec63 translocon complex to
access its mRNA substrates. In the current funding period, we have shown that the Sec61 translocon bridges
IRE1α with the Sec63/BiP complex to turnoff IRE1α signaling during persistent ER stress. Our studies
discovered that the Sec63/BiP complex is also responsible for freeing clogged Sec61 translocons as well as
promoting protein folding in the ER. These new findings raise the hypothesis that the IRE1α/Sec61/Sec63
complex plays a central role in the activation and inactivation of IRE1α/XBP1 signaling to maintain ER
homeostasis in cells. In the next funding period, we will test this hypothesis by (i) determining the role of this
complex in making life-or-death decisions during ER stress; (ii) determining the architecture of the
IRE1α/Sec61/Sec63/BiP complex; (iii) determining the role of this complex in sensing/responding to protein
translocation defects in the ER. In an independent aim, we will establish a novel functional link between a
cytosolic quality control and IRE1α/XBP1 signaling. We plan to use a combined approach of CRISPR/Cas9
edited cells, biochemical reconstitution, and structural approaches to address these problems. Overall, we
expect these studies will provide a mechanistic insight into how the UPR and protein translocation/quality
control pathways work together to maintain ER homeostasis. The knowledge gained from these studies will
inform the development of possible treatments for several human diseases including diabetes, cancer, and
polycystic liver diseases."
10828745,"SUMMARY
 Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune complexes that form in response to a variety of pathogen-
associated or stress-induced stimuli. Activated inflammasomes recruit Caspase-1, which initiates downstream
inflammatory signaling. Genetic deletion of inflammasome components in mice has demonstrated the critical
importance of inflammasomes during infection by viral, bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens. In addition, the
inappropriate activation of inflammasomes has been linked to numerous auto-inflammatory and auto-immune
diseases in humans.
 Host-pathogen coevolution is a major factor underlying the genetic and molecular determinants of cross-
species transmission and infectious disease. The antagonistic nature of host-pathogen interactions can drive
recurrent cycles of adaptation and counter-adaptation. These evolutionary ‘arms races’ drive rapid molecular
innovation. Thus, the unique history of pathogen encounters of each lineage has driven species-specific
adaptations. It should therefore not be surprising that laboratory mice are poor models of many human-specific
or human-adapted pathogens. In this proposal I outline my vision to leverage the species-specific nature of
host-pathogen interactions to develop improved models of human immunity and pathogenesis.
 Using a combination of evolution-guided and mechanism-focused approaches, I have made the following
discoveries: 1) the Dengue virus (DENV) protease NS2B3 activates the human (but not mouse) NLRP1
inflammasome. DENV is the first known pathogen that activates human NLRP1. This finding supports a
formerly unrecognized role for NLRP1 in host immunity and pathogenesis to DENV infection. 2) the enteric
bacterial pathogen Shigella antagonizes the human (but not mouse) NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome. Based on
this finding, I have found that NLRC4-deficient mice are highly susceptible to enteric infection and. exhibit
hallmarks of intestinal inflammation. Thus, I have established the first mouse model of Shigellosis.
 This proposal seeks to boldly expand on these observations using innovative approaches to generate new
or significantly refine models of human infectious disease. I propose to 1) establish a new model of DENV
immunity and pathogenesis, and 2) advance the development of the Shigellosis mouse model. Both DENV and
Shigella are important human pathogens, which combined cause >200 million infections per year. Improved
DENV infection models is a clear but unmet need, and until my Shigellosis mouse model, mice were thought to
be refractory to Shigella enteric infection. Thus, the successful completion of the stated goals will significantly
impact human infectious disease research."
10831499,"Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) that is used in clinical practice to detect bone loss, may not be
sufficiently sensitive to identify those individuals who are losing structural integrity of the skeleton over time. High
resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) scanning can detect age-related
compartmental skeletal deterioration that independently predicts incident fracture even after considering DXA-
derived bone mineral density. This project will perform follow-up high resolution imaging in the third generation
cohort of the Framingham Study (Gen3) that will be used to assess the contributions of novel molecular
biomarkers of longitudinal deterioration of bone microarchitecture, as there are almost no longitudinal studies of
contributors to the loss of bone microarchitecture and strength. The long term goal of this research is to identify
novel molecular biomarkers of age-related changes in bone microarchitecture and strength that could be used
to predict skeletal fragility by acting as a proxy for HR-pQCT, and that identify mechanistic pathways that could
be targeted for drug development. The objective of this proposal is to determine the contribution of two different
novel molecular biomarkers to age-related changes in bone microarchitecture and incident fractures in the
Framingham Osteoporosis Study. The central hypothesis is that plasma metabolites and clonal hematopoiesis
of indeterminate potential (CHIP) will be associated with declines in bone microarchitecture and strength. The
hypotheses are based on recently generated preliminary data showing associations between these two novel
risk factors and both BMD and fracture. Aim 1 will determine the association between plasma metabolites and
a) longitudinal changes in bone microarchitecture and strength, and b) incident fracture. Approximately 700
metabolite measures have already been performed in the Gen3 cohort as well as the Offspring cohort, which will
permit a replication of findings generated the Gen3 cohort by analyzing data that will be available in the Offspring.
Aim 2 will determine the association of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) with bone density,
microarchitecture and strength in the Gen3 cohort after performing deep targeted sequencing of the four most
common genes implicated in CHIP (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2). This proposal addresses key knowledge
gaps by using state-of-the-art technologies to identify molecular determinants of longitudinal age-related declines
in bone microarchitecture and strength in a large, well-characterized cohort. Results from this project will be
impactful, as they will provide unique insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related skeletal
fragility, and may ultimately identify targets for future diagnostics and/or therapeutics. This study has the potential
to transform the field in terms of defining the impact of reduced muscle mass."
11142054,"Morbidity and mortality rates from type 2 diabetes (T2D) are high and continue to increase, with only 32% of adults who have T2D meeting targets for glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). Immigrants and racial/ethnic groups have worse rates of achieving the target A1c goal. Self-management is critical in meeting glycemic control. Haitian immigrants have unique migration experiences compared to other ethnic groups that may impact their T2D self-management. Our preliminary work reveals differences in Haitian immigrants dietary and exercise habits compared with their practices in Haiti. Haitian immigrants also have higher A1c levels compared with African Americans and Cuban Americans. The purpose of this application submitted in response to PA-18-129 is to characterize self-management behaviors, barriers to T2D self-management, and glycemic control in adult Haitian immigrants. Our aim is to reduce health care disparities by developing a T2D self-management education intervention specific to adult Haitian immigrants. Data from the K99 phase will inform the development of a diabetes self-management education (DSME) program to be carried out during the R00 phase and establish feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. Our aims are to: 1) Describe self-management behaviors of 100 adult Haitian immigrants with T2D as measured by multiple methods (diabetes self-management survey, 3-day diet recall, blood glucose level, physical activity via accelerometer, and pill counts) and their correlations with glycemic biomarkers (A1c and continuous glucose variability via continuous glucose monitoring (CGM); 2) Describe barriers to self-management in these 100 adult Haitian immigrants with T2D including socio-demographic status, health status (comorbidity), psychosocial factors (cultural health beliefs, acculturative and discrimination stress), and environmental factors (access to care, food insecurity) using mixed methods (quantitative surveys and interviews with a subsample); 3) Use community-engaged approaches with 10 adult Haitian immigrants with T2D to develop a DSME program to reduce barriers and improve self-management and glycemic control; and 4) Conduct a randomized pilot study with 60 adult Haitian immigrants to establish feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the DSME program compared to standard care. We will use descriptive approaches for the K99 and aim 3 of the R00 phase. For aim 4, we will use a randomized pilot study design. A hip actigraphy measures of physical activity, glycemic biomarkers from A1c and glucose variability via CGM, self-report, objective, and interview measures of self-management will be collected. Data will be analyzed using multiple regression, content analysis techniques, and preliminary effect sizes will be generated from aim 4. The project is significant in its potential to enhance understanding of T2D self-management and glycemic control in this immigrant population at high-risk for negative T2D health outcomes. This study addresses NINR’s key theme, “Self-Management of Chronic Conditions”. The accomplished mentor committee and the candidate’s ongoing research relationships in this field will create the ideal setting for these investigations."
10807961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cisgender women account for ~20% of new HIV infections in the US, and are systematically under-accessed
for HIV prevention. The intersection of patient-side barriers (lack of patient knowledge, perceived risk, and
medical mistrust), and provider-side barriers (lack of knowledge, discomfort with prevention counseling, and
bias) impacts uptake of novel HIV prevention methods, such as available and forthcoming methods of pre-ex-
posure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV (oral, injectable, etc.). To address these barriers, the trainee (Ms. Anderson)
will adapt a family planning (FP) shared decision-making (SDM) tool for use in HIV prevention counseling.
SDM involves introducing choice, describing options, and exploring patient preferences to aid in health care
decisions, while empowering women, decreasing provider bias, increasing satisfaction with care, and increas-
ing adherence to care regimens. The adapted tool will be tested for acceptability/feasibility with providers and
clients at Title X federally-funded FP clinics, a high-reach setting for women at risk for HIV from heterosexual
contact. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework for adaptation, the specific aims are to (1) assess the utility of
SDM practices for HIV prevention and barriers/facilitators to implementation, through (a) focus groups with Title
X providers in Metro Atlanta (K=4, N=32) and (b) theater testing interviews with racially/ethnically diverse cis-
gender adult Title X clients (N=40); (2) adapt the evidence-based World Health Organization (WHO) Decision-
Making Tool for FP Clients and Providers for HIV prevention; and, (3) conduct mixed-method acceptability/fea-
sibility testing of the adapted SDM tool with Title X providers (N=40) and clients (N=40). This study will result in
an acceptable and feasible HIV prevention SDM tool for use with cisgender women attending FP clinics, to be
further tested and disseminated to promote HIV prevention among women, advancing efforts to end the HIV
epidemic. Additionally, this work will support the training of Ms. Anderson, who is committed to becoming a
high caliber, NIH-funded researcher in HIV prevention and treatment, and improvement of care interactions.
Ms. Anderson’s 3-year training plan includes: (1) formally developing methodological skills in implementation
science and human-centered design, (2) advancing understanding of the context of clinical HIV prevention,
including biomedical prevention and clinical interactions, and (3) developing skills in the areas of measurement
and evaluation of interventions and interventional pathways. The team of mentors, Drs. Sales (Primary Spon-
sor), Sheth (Co-Sponsor), and Kottke (Expert Advisor), will provide oversight, guidance, and mentorship to Ms.
Anderson during the course of her training, in the topic areas of implementation science, HIV prevention, clini-
cal interactions, and intervention evaluation. Ms. Anderson will leverage resources at Emory University, includ-
ing the Network for Evaluation and Implementation Sciences, the Network for Evaluation and Implementation
Science, the Women and Children’s Center, and the Prevention Research Center. The candidate, mentorship
team, and the environment are extremely well situated to achieve the proposed research and training aims."
10835003,"Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness worldwide (70 million patients), is managed medically by treating
the symptom of increased intraocular pressure (IOP), but 10% of patients still go blind. IOP is controlled in the
anterior segment of the eye, which contains the trabecular meshwork (TM) extracellular matrix, the anatomical
pathway for drainage of aqueous humor fluid. The TM tissue is diseased in most forms of glaucoma; loss of
TM homeostasis leads to elevated IOP. Hereditary open angle glaucoma, affecting ~3 million young patients,
is caused by mutations in myocilin, a protein highly expressed in the TM. Since 3/2011, studies funded from
R01EY021205 have changed the paradigm for anti-glaucoma therapeutics by laying the molecular foundation
for approaches that target the disease process, which are now being pursued in academia and industry.
 We clarified molecular details of the toxic gain-of-function pathogenic mechanism in which mutant
myocilin accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of TM cells, leading to TM cell death and an
accelerated timeline for vision loss. Studies from R01EY021205 (a) contributed fundamental knowledge of
myocilin structure, (b) discovered a counter-productive interaction between myocilin and the ER-resident
Hsp90 chaperone Grp94, and (c) characterized myocilin misfolding as amyloid. Wild-type and many different
myocilin variants harbor a misfolding propensity; thus, proteostasis issues identified in familial myocilin-
associated glaucoma are likely at play in many more patients.
 Amyloid formation by myocilin places glaucoma alongside more well-studied amyloid diseases like
Alzheimer and SOD-1 dependent amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, yet our comprehension of the role of amyloid in
glaucoma is in its infancy. Our current objective is to better understand molecular aspects of myocilin
fibrilization, focused on the relevant olfactomedin (OLF) domain. Our multidisciplinary team will (a) clarify
initiation of aggregation by studying solution structures of wild-type and selected OLF variants, as well as
corresponding multi-length scale dynamics, using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure and relaxation methods (Wade Van Horn, Co-I) (b) compare the
end-point structures of selected OLF aggregates to known amyloids by solid state NMR (Anant Paravastu, Co-
I) and evaluate cytotoxicity of intermediate aggregates and (c) evaluate common allele full-length myocilin
variants for experimental hallmarks of pathogenicity. The expected outcome is a better understanding of the
myocilin misfolding process at the molecular level, including molecular determinants of pathogenicity, to enable
novel modalities for studying, diagnosing, and treating myocilin-associated glaucoma. More broadly, continued
structure/dysfunction studies of myocilin will not only contribute to our understanding of glaucoma and its role
in the TM, but will also extend our comprehension of the many other OLF domains, which are implicated
broadly in physiology and diseases."
10809050,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Following a stroke, deficits in independent mobility are a primary contributor to decreased quality of life, as
many people with chronic stroke (PwCS) are prevented from returning to their prior levels of activity
participation or involvement in the community. A major cause of mobility deficits is gait instability, which can
increase the risk of falls and limit independent function. While several common rehabilitation methods (e.g.
locomotor training, traditional balance training, strengthening) can improve some aspects of function, they have
failed to address fall incidence among PwCS. In part, this lack of success is likely due to current interventions
not being targeted toward the specific mechanisms causing post-stroke gait instability.
A long-term goal of this research is to develop a toolbox of mechanism-based interventions to improve various
aspects of post-stroke function. As a step toward this goal, the objective of the present proposal is to determine
whether targeted perturbation training can reduce falls in PwCS by improving gait stability. While perturbation
training has previously been used to reduce fall risk in other clinical populations, it has thus far been
unsuccessful at doing so among PwCS. This lack of success may be due to the nature of the applied
perturbations, which are traditionally designed to elicit discrete Reactive responses to avoid a loss of balance.
In contrast, the present proposal will apply mechanical perturbations designed to elicit Proactive adjustments in
the neuromechanical strategies used to ensure walking stability with every step. Such Proactive perturbations
may be better suited to prevent the intrinsic movement errors that are a primary contributor to losses of
balance and falls among PwCS. The central hypothesis of this work is that that unlike Reactive methods,
Proactive perturbation training will retrain generalized gait stabilization strategies, reducing the risk of falls. This
hypothesis will be addressed through three Specific Aims.
The first Specific Aim is to determine whether fall rate in PwCS is reduced by Proactive or Reactive training,
with immediate clinical implications for the development of interventions that can be applied in the real world.
The second Specific Aim is to characterize the neuromechanical mechanisms that underlie gait changes with
perturbation training, revealing whether the stabilization strategies normally used to ensure walking balance
can be strengthened with appropriately targeted perturbations. Finally, the third Specific Aim is to determine
whether Proactive or Reactive training produces generalized gait stabilization, as an ideal intervention would
improve resilience even to untrained perturbations that may be experienced in real world walking.
The proposed project is based on a neuromechanical framework of bipedal walking control, and thus allows
investigation of both clinically relevant outcomes (fall rate) and mechanistic measures of the strategies used to
ensure stability. The knowledge resulting from this project has the potential to contribute to the development of
a larger-scale rehabilitation paradigm addressing the important problem of post-stroke falls."
10837793,"Project Summary:
The rat is commonly used as an experimental model to investigate a wide diversity of biological processes of
medical relevance. These include neuroscience and brain function, behavioral research, and drug dependency
and addiction. Similarly, aspects of cardiovascular and renal function are more readily investigated in the rat
where the volumes of fluid within these systems are on a much more manageable scale than in smaller rodents.
The utility of rat models for investigation has led to the development of inbred rat strains that harbor medically
relevant phenotypes. Such models have drawn on pre-existing, natural genetic variation to fix genomic diversity
that creates traits such as disease susceptibility. The existence of such models has spurred genetic
investigations that have sought to uncover genetic variation responsible for disease susceptibility traits and to
utilize such knowledge to reveal mechanistic aspects of disease pathogenesis.
However, rat studies can be impeded by the poor quality of existing rat genomic resources. For example, the rat
genome reference sequence is very underdeveloped compared to that of human and mouse. Contiguity of the
genome assembly is an order of magnitude smaller and gene annotation is much reduced. Further, the reference
genome was generated from the Brown Norway inbred rat strain. This strain is biologically remote from many rat
strains used in research.
The rat is recognized as a highly adaptable species. Evolutionary biologists have recognized that an essential
element of adaptation arises from structural variation events in the genome. For example, the adaptation of
humans to high starch diets after the introduction of grain-based agriculture is associated with structural variation
in the amylase gene. This structural variation results from gene duplication events that are adaptive in permitting
increased carbohydrate digestion. These duplication and other large-scale events cannot be observed and
understood simply by alignment of short read genome sequence to the reference genome. Long reads are
required to capture structural variation events.
The objective of our project is to advance rat genomics resources to increase their utility to ongoing studies of
this animal model. To do so, we will use PacBio long read sequencing to capture all genomic variation (SNP and
structural). We will assemble de novo the genomes of 9 widely used rat strains. We will also introduce additional
annotation of the rat genome to increase the numbers of transcripts and proteins associated with the rat
reference genome using long read RNA sequencing. The result of our work will be made available via the Rat
Genome Database and by Ensembl and will provide essential research information to the many laboratories that
employ rat models in their research."
10840861,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are causative agents in ano-genital and head and neck cancers. Our long-term goal is to identify, and develop, novel approaches for targeting these viral diseases; to do this we must enhance our understanding of the viral life cycle and how it interacts with the host. HPV activates the DNA damage response (DDR) during the viral life cycle and uses homologous recombination (HR) to replicate its genome. The Morgan lab has identified several HR factors involved in HPV replication including TopBP1, BRD4, SIRT1 and WRN. We have demonstrated that these factors regulate the levels and fidelity of HPV16 E1-E2 DNA replication in C33a cells. Following WRN depletion, E1-E2 replication switches from high fidelity mechanisms to break induced replication (BIR). BIR is highly mutagenic and occurs when a paused fork is unable to be resolved by WRN. In the absence of WRN there is excess recruitment of MUS81 to E1-E2 replicating DNA, an endonuclease that causes DNA double strand breaks at paused forks in the absence of WRN. This resolves the fork and allows BIR to continue replication, albeit with low fidelity. We present data demonstrating that WRN is a restriction factor for the HPV16 life cycle; in the absence of WRN there is increased cell proliferation, DNA damage and viral replication in organotypic raft cultures. We observed a similar phenotype following SAMHD1 depletion, another HR factor. WRN and SAMHD1 are in the same cellular complex along with other DDR factors involved in HPV life cycles. Our first objective is to determine the roles of the WRN-SAMHD1 complex in controlling HPV life cycles. The central hypothesis is that this complex controls high fidelity replication during the viral life cycle, and that targeting components of this complex along with MUS81 may block HPV replication. Using a novel HPV16 genome, we will investigate the levels and the fidelity of viral replication during the viral life cycle. Our second objective is to determine whether there are altered host DNA replication forks in HPV16 positive cells. The central hypothesis is that differences can be exploited for differential targeting of HPV positive cells. This will be done in association with Pietro Pichierri, a WRN and DNA replication and repair expert; Morgan and Pichierri have already published together. Our third objective is to investigate the activation of the innate immune response (IIR) in HPV16 cells depleted for WRN and SAMHD1. The central hypothesis is that depletion of WRN or SAMHD1 in the presence of the active DDR in HPV16 cells results in excess cytoplasmic DNA fragments that activate the IIR. The outcomes are crucial for achieving our long-term goals. For example, targeting of WRN enzyme activities could boost the IIR in HPV16 positive cells, assisting the adaptive immune response (and immunotherapy) to eliminate HPV positive cells. If there are different factors replicating host DNA in the presence of HPV, these could be targeted to preferentially kill HPV positive cells. Double targeting of WRN and MUS81 in HPV positive cells may block viral replication resulting in cell death following E6/E7 depletion and reactivation of p53/pRb pathways."

10633280,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a serious illness that disproportionately affects Alaska Native
communities. Sitka Tribe of Alaska has organized an environmental monitoring program and seafood safety
testing program along with other regional partners (called SEATOR: Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research)
to reduce the burden of PSP disease in Southeast Alaska. This grant seeks to augment SEATOR's ongoing
efforts, through additional data collection and partnerships with the Sitka School District and Emory University.
Collecting additional years of PSP toxin monitoring data using the same protocols as today will allow a time-
series analysis to inform a cutting-edge forecasting model that will give Southeast Alaska residents warning of
especially risky subsistence shellfish harvest times, and thereby prevent poisonings. Collecting new data on
specific kinds of PSP toxins (rather than only measuring the presence or absence of any PSP toxin) can clarify
which other settings around the world are most similar (e.g., by comparing toxin profiles). This is important
because PSP is a global health problem and there are other locations that could benefit from an informative
prediction model, or that might be able to provide useful information for developing this region's model.
SEATOR will continue training members of the community via workshops on how to collect and process
samples per the citizen science framework of the ongoing work. This project also includes planned K12
educational interventions to target PSP prevention messages to youth at particular risk of PSP toxicity, while
also promoting science education and traditional lifeways. This project is fully community-based participatory
research (CBPR) building on existing tribal organization programs, with employment and skills-training
opportunities for members of the community, to meet community-prioritized needs and to address this health
disparity."
10817022,"Project Summary/Abstract
In patients with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), early life seizures and intellectual
disability are frequently accompanied by disturbances in arousal/sleep, communication/social reciprocity,
feeding and/or sensory integration. These neurobehavioral comorbidities are hypothesized to reflect a synergy
of two independent but intertwined processes: (i) an inciting lesion (genetic or structural) capable of itself altering
neurodevelopmental trajectories, and (ii) periods of frequent seizures, particularly early in life, that further
exacerbate developmental delays. In many patients, behavioral deterioration may begin prior to seizure onset
and may persist despite complete seizure control (or spontaneous remission). With whole exome sequencing,
we now recognize a rapidly expanding list of genetic DEEs, which have lent to genetically informed mouse
models that are critically poised to develop the urgently needed precision therapies that extend beyond seizure
control. Today’s models are actively revealing novel mechanistic insights into molecular and circuit-level patho-
physiology, thanks to the latest advances in genome manipulation and measurements of omics, functional
connectivity and calcium imaging, as well as continued ergonomic improvements in rodent electro-
encephalography. In contrast, there have been few technical and conceptual innovations within preclinical
assays for neurobehavioral impairment, leaving the field reliant on behavioral batteries that may be confounded
by primary disturbances in sleep/arousal, seizure recency, motor deficits and human olfactory interference. In
this application, we apply the latest advances in homecage instrumentation and automated videotracking to
define endpoints for DEE-related neurobehavioral impairment that are derived under experimenter-free
conditions (remote behavioral telemetry). We describe a mouse model of DEE with early life seizures that
displays a robust multifaceted behavioral syndrome with core features of hyperactivity and insomnia. Using this
model system, this proposal tests the central hypothesis of genetic DEE, that the neurobehavioral consequences
of the causative genetic lesion can be dissociated from the behavioral aftereffects of recurrent early life seizures.
In Aim 1, we examine a transcription factor that is activated by seizures in the hippocampus, and which is known
to shape a range of emotional and cognitive behaviors. In Aim 2, we test the importance of early life seizures by
comparing behavioral and epileptic consequences of an early versus late genetic ablation. In Aim 3, we connect
hyperactivity and insomnia in our mutant mice to primary disruptions in 5h ultradian rhythms of activity, and test
whether pharmacological or behavioral interventions to restore ultradian rhythms exert therapeutic benefits. In
the short term, these experiments will build molecular and circuit-level insights while delivering a set of novel
neurobehavioral endpoints to facilitate drug discovery in DEE models. In the long term, this work develops the
preclinical foundation for digital neuropsychiatry, where subjective measures of behavioral wellbeing are
supplemented with continuous, in situ wearable-derived endpoints that inform clinical trials and patient care."

for the treatment of scars and their sequelae. Fibroblasts are recognized as the primary cell responsible for
depositing extracellular matrix and causing skin fibrosis. However, progress towards the development of
treatments aimed at reducing scars is impeded by a limited understanding of specific fibroblast subpopulations
responsible for regenerative healing. We have observed that neural crest-derived facial skin wounds heal with
less fibrosis than mesoderm-derived scalp wounds, somite-derived dorsal wounds, and lateral plate mesoderm-
derived ventral wounds. Furthermore, through single cell RNA sequencing, we have identified that neural crest-
derived facial fibroblasts promote regeneration following skin injury through a Robo2-EID1-EP300 axis, and
bromodomain inhibition of EP300 guides fibroblasts to heal with reduced skin scarring. In this proposal, we
examine the potential of the Robo2-Eid1-EP300 axis and EP300 bromodomain inhibition to guide dorsal scarring
fibroblasts to heal with reduced fibrosis. We will employ both cell transplantation and CRISPR-Cas9 approaches,
using histology, immunohistochemistry, transcriptional analysis, and flow cytometry to evaluate the regenerative
capacity of Robo2+ fibroblasts within wounds. We will then determine the role of EP300 interacting inhibitor of
differentiation 1 (EID1) in regulating Robo2 fibroblast activity in skin wounds. We will employ cell transplantation
and CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to robustly determine whether activation of EID1 promotes regeneration of dorsal
wounds to heal like facial wounds. Finally, having established that the Robo2-EID1-EP300 axis is responsible
for regenerative healing, we will inhibit EP300 signaling using both small molecule and transgenic approaches
to guide facial-like regenerative healing in dorsal wounds. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop
therapeutics that target fibrogenic wound cell dynamics to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the
proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of
cutaneous scarring, shedding light on the contributions of Robo2-EID1-EP300 activity in wound repair and
scarring, and inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapeutics."
10782504,"Abstract
Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe's disease is a fatal genetic demyelinating disease of the central
nervous system affecting 1 in 100,000 live births with no cure or effective long-term treatment. GLD is caused
by loss-of-function mutations in the galactosylceramidase (galc) gene, where loss of GALC enzymatic function
results in toxic accumulation of its substrate, a lipid called galactosylsphingosine or `psychosine'. Psychosine
cytotoxicity is considered the basis of several key pathologies in GLD. Neuropathology in GLD is marked by
profound demyelination and inflammation. However, molecular details of these processes are limited, leaving
few therapeutic options. Early histological evidence for CD8+ T cells within demyelinated lesions in both the twi
mouse brain and human GLD brain had suggested a role for adaptive immunity in this disease. However, the
function of CD8+ T cells in GLD has not been previously determined. To address this gap in our knowledge, we
analyzed the timing of T cell population changes by flow cytometry in CNS tissues from the twitcher mouse
model of GLD and compared with wt littermates. We identified a rapid and protracted elevation of T cells in the
twi CNS that was coincident with the onset of clinical disease at postnatal day 21 (P21). These data were
confirmed using single-cell RNA sequencing on twi and wt littermate brain tissues from which identified a 9-fold
increase in CD8+ T cells in twi mouse brains at P21. Our transcriptomic data also defined the CD8+ population
as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). To test the function of CD8+ CTLs in GLD-like disease in twi mice, we
depleted CD8+ T cells by administering anti-CD8 antibody to twi mice and found that this treatment effectively
prevented disease onset, preserved wellness and completely prevented CNS demyelination while also
attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in brain and blood. These novel and highly translational data
portend a pathogenic role for CD8+ T cells in GLD and underlie the basis for our overall hypothesis that CD8+
T cells are pathogenic in GLD and directly contribute to disease. Accordingly, Aim 1 will characterize the
spatial and temporal development of CD8+ T cells in twi mice and challenge the contribution of CD8+ T cells
using knockout mouse lines to then assess clinical, biochemical, and pathological outcomes. Aim 2 will define
the overall nature of adaptive immunity by evaluating contribution of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cell-mediated
immunity in twi mice using targeted depletion and genetic strategies. Aim 3 will identify and profile the timing,
and location T cells responding to authentic antigen, the clonality of the T cells using T cell β chain VDJ
phenotyping, and then identify the nature of the antigen presenting cell types using transgenic reporter mice.
These multi-disciplinary studies will interrogate a previously unrecognized CD8+ T cell neuroinflammatory
response in GLD. Outcomes of these studies are expected to fill an important gap in our understanding on the
fundamental cellular pathological mechanisms underlying the development CD8+ T cell mediated
neuropathology and disease in GLD."
10839831,"Addictions and the associated public health problems of HIV transmission, crime and violence, exact a severe
toll on our nation, costing billions annually in health care, lost productivity, and incarceration. These inter-related
problems have only worsened during the global COVID-19 pandemic, still ongoing. We need to speed the
""forward"" translation of recent neuroscience and neurogenetic knowledge into more effective clinical treatments
for the addictions. Conversely, for addiction treatments with some known efficacy, we can now apply new
neuroscience and genetic tools in ""backward-translation"" -- e.g., finding why a treatment works well for some
individuals, yet not at all for others. To help meet the need for skilled translational researchers, this application
proposes continuation of a successful (32 total trainees; 16 in the current funding period) NIDA T32 Translational
Addiction Research Fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania. The training program (4 pre- and 4 post-
doctoral positions) makes explicit a long-standing translational tradition at Penn, integrating clinical and basic
research strengths to create trainees, whether clinical or preclinical, Ph.D.s or M.D.s, who will accelerate
addiction science in the next decade. The emphasis on translation is reflected at each level of the program -
through the Co-PIs (clinical and basic, Drs. Childress and Blendy), the internal and external advisors, the formal
didactics, the ""dual"" (clinical - preclinical) journal clubs, and in the trainees' mentored research projects. The
translational emphasis of the program is driven by the recognition that addictions are complex disorders, multi-
determined by interaction of genetic vulnerabilities, exposure to drug, and a host of modulating (e.g., early
trauma, stress, cultural norms) influences. Trainees are thus offered state-of-the-art knowledge about these
interacting determinants through a didactic series specific to the program, and through mentored projects that
may range from molecular and genetic studies, to brain systems (neuroscience and neuroimaging, including
PET), to clinical treatment trials, and drug policy. This wide range of choices is enabled by the long history of
excellence in addiction research at the University, reflected in several interacting academic research entities
(Penn Center for Studies on Addiction; Translational Research Laboratories/CNB; Center for AIDS Research;
Penn PET Center; the Complex Systems Lab) offering skilled, successful mentors to the Fellowship. Mentored
research also takes place within several affiliated treatment settings (VA, Presby-Penn, local opioid treatment
clinics, and mobile HIV Prevention units), critical for translating new research findings into the ""real world”.

The molecular machines of the cell include factories such as the ribosome and proteosome, and the numerous
molecular motors, switches, pumps, clocks, and information processors whose functions underlie all of cell
biology. The goals of the Molecular Machines Mechanism and Structure (M3S) Training Grant are to unify
the biophysics community at Penn State University and to train a diverse cohort of interdisciplinary students
the fundamental knowledge needed to understand the inner workings of the molecular machines that power
cell function. The training grant includes faculty and students from three graduate programs: Biochemistry,
Microbiology and Molecular Biology (BMMB); Chemistry (CHEM); and Biomedical Engineering (BME). Eight
students will be admitted every year at the end of the 1st year of their PhD program, and the training group
will consist of 16 students, supported in the 2nd and 3rd year of their PhD. Students will be trained in three
areas: structure, function, and simulations. First, students will be exposed to cutting edge structural biology
tools such as cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography and NMR in order to develop their ability to
understand the atomic structures of the component parts that make up molecular machines. Second, they
will learn the foundations of microscopy instrumentation and image analysis that underlie single-molecule and
super-resolution imaging of the functional dynamics of molecular machines. Finally, they will learn the
fundamentals of Molecular Dynamics, Brownian Dynamics, and stochastic simulations, empowering them use
computational tools to develop mechanistic hypotheses and to integrate and interpret experimental results
into simulations of molecular machine structure and function. During Fall and Spring semesters, students will
meet weekly as part of a 1-cr course titled ‘Machine Shop’. Instruction will revolve around a single theme for
each month, such as a biological question, a technique, or a specific molecule. Building on this theme, four
faculty trainers will lead: i) a tutorial on RCR, rigor and reproducibility, professional development, or a related
training; ii) a journal club; iii) a student presentation; and iv) an all student/faculty event such as a faculty
presentation, an outside speaker, a tutorial on available resources at the university, or a related activity.
Summer activities will include workshops and a retreat. Additionally, students will be trained in 3D molecular
animations, which will: i) develop their science communication skills; ii) build their intuition about the dynamic
interactions of molecules at nanometer and micro/millisecond timescales, and: iii) reinforce the theme of using
computation to understand the interrelationship of the structure and dynamics of molecular machines. Finally,
students will be trained in scientific writing and will write a 6-page proposal in their 3rd year. The M3S Training
Program will aggressively recruit underrepresented minority students and students with disabilities, and will
work to develop a safe and inclusive campus community that maximizes student belonging and retention."
10834084,"Project Summary
Repeated exposure to abuse and neglect substantially increases the likelihood of poor child and adult life
outcomes. Current child welfare (CW) family preservation services (FPS), however, do not reduce
maltreatment recidivism. Maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has been associated with poor
parent-child interaction, is a promising intervention target to reduce maltreatment. Our prior work showed that
mothers receiving FPS to prevent recidivism have a high prevalence of trauma-related disorders. High rates of
PTSD among these mothers suggests that treating PTSD may reduce recidivism in a significant subset of high-
risk mothers. In addition to directly increasing risk of maltreatment, PTSD-related cognitive deficits may make
learning parenting skills more difficult, contributing to intergenerational persistence of trauma. Hypothesis:
Parenting Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (P-STAIR), an intervention targeting maternal
PTSD-related parenting deficits, will reduce recidivism. We use a combination of STAIR to target the adverse
effects of PTSD (and related depression) on parenting and an abbreviated version of PCIT to improve
parenting skills. STAIR is a two-phase treatment to improve emotion regulation and interpersonal skills prior to
exposure treatment. It is more effective than exposure therapy alone and increases treatment retention for
child abuse-related PTSD. PCIT is a dyadic treatment that has promise for reducing recidivism in CW mothers.
We added a focus on how PTSD symptoms affect parenting and parent-child interaction skills: P-STAIR.
Preliminary Data: Following P-STAIR, mothers had a 7-fold lower rate of new confirmed maltreatment reports
(2.7%) than NYC’s FPS population as a whole (18.6%). Maternal PTSD and depression symptoms, measured
at 90-day follow-up, show that 92.3% of mothers no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Independent
behavioral observations demonstrated significant reduction of negative parenting behaviors and increased
positive parenting behaviors. The pilot data indicate P-STAIR is feasible. We propose to conduct a RCT to
evaluate efficacy of P-STAIR compared to supportive counseling (SC). Aim 1: Compare P-STAIR to SC with
respect to maternal PTSD/depression symptom reduction. Aim 2: Compare P-STAIR to SC with respect to
parenting behaviors. Aim 3: Compare P-STAIR to SC with respect to maltreatment recidivism. Impact: If
demonstrated efficacious, P-STAIR will reduce maltreatment recidivism among high-risk CW involved mothers,
ameliorating lives of children and families and reducing maternal stigma. Our CW partners’ support letters
indicate P-STAIR has potential for ready CW dissemination, thereby altering real-world clinical practice."
10816500,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Through this K23 award, Dr. Anthony Muiru will obtain the knowledge,
skills, and expertise necessary to become a leading investigator in patient-oriented clinical research of chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and elevated blood pressure (BP) among people of recent African ancestry. During his
renal fellowship, he leveraged the infrastructure of the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health
(SEARCH) study to define the epidemiology of CKD in rural East Africa. He established the SEARCH-CKD
study, comprising a representative sample of 3,686 SEARCH participants from rural Uganda and Kenya. Key
findings from initial work in SEARCH-CKD included: 1) High prevalence of unexplained leukocyturia and
hematuria; 2) a striking geographic variation in CKD prevalence; and 3) high prevalence of elevated BP among
individuals with CKD. Dr. Muiru intends to follow up on these initial SEARCH-CKD findings to achieve the
following goals: 1) transform SEARCH-CKD from a cross-sectional study into a longitudinal cohort study; 2)
gain hands-on experience in longitudinal cohort management, collection of bio-samples and subsequent
measurement of analytes; 3) acquire expertise in advanced epidemiological and biostatistical methods,
environmental epidemiology; and 4) obtain certification as a hypertension specialist. To achieve these goals,
Dr. Muiru has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors, he will enroll in a customized
selection of courses, and will continue to leverage the infrastructure established by the SEARCH study.
CKD leads to elevated BP and elevated BP in turn accelerates CKD progression. The burden of these two
conditions is growing dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa. This K23 award will allow Dr. Muiru to address key
knowledge gaps in regard to CKD and elevated BP in rural East Africa and provide him with the support and
mentorship necessary to accomplish the following aims: 1) determine the significance of leukocyturia and
hematuria observed among individuals living in rural East Africa; 2) examine potential risk factors for CKD that
may explain the geographic variation in CKD prevalence in rural East Africa, 3) define BP phenotypes among
participants with CKD (~half HIV-positive) by obtaining standardized single time-point BP measurement
followed by 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure measurement. This proposal will provide Dr. Muiru with an
invaluable training platform that will propel him into an independent research career. In addition, the proposed
research will advance our understanding of kidney disease and elevated BP among people of recent African
ancestry."
10795002,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In recent years, it has become apparent that a “gut-brain” axis exists where communication occurs between the
gut, its microbiota, the immune system and the brain. Although not fully understood, this axis has a major role in
the onset and severity of many neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). In direct response to PAR-19-070, we
propose to study the role of the gut-brain axis in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is a common, progressive and
devastating NDD characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. The most prominent pathological
hallmarks of the disease are the extracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides in the form of plaques.
Non-identical amyloid proteins may accelerate reciprocal amyloid aggregation in a prion-like fashion. A growing
body of evidence suggests that intestinal bacteria produces amyloid-like proteins that form biofilms. Loss of gut
barrier integrity leads to bacterial breach and bacterial amyloid translocation that potentially causes inflammation
and accelerate central-Aβ pathology that then contribute to NDD progression from gut to brain. Gut inflammation
can also impair nutrient absorption. B12 influences myelin homeostasis and its malabsorption accelerates brain
amyloidosis. Myelin loss and the inability of the oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for the production and
maintenance of myelin, to repair myelin damage, are central features of AD and are associated with dementia.
B12 biosynthesis is confined to certain bacteria. Luminal B12 is absorbed by gut epithelial receptors and stored
as transcobalamine-B12 complex (tBC). For B12 to actively take part in biological processes, it needs to be
stored in the form of tBC. The pathologic cascade linking gut pathology to Aβ deposition is not understood. We
will develop the idea that early acute gut inflammation leads to impaired gut integrity and B12 malabsorption
leading to accelerated central-Aβ pathology. It is this “loss of gut barrier integrity” that sustains an environment
conductive for onset and progression of Aβ aggregation related dementias. We propose to test the following
hypothesis that gut dysfunction precedes amyloid-β aggregation in the AD brain. (i) Restoring receptor-
mediated B12 absorption and (ii) improving integrity of the gut by “early” beneficial bacterial therapy
will lead to reduced Aβ aggregation “later” in the transgenic AD mice brain.
In Aim 1, we will determine if gut inflammation early in life accelerates Aβ aggregation in the brain. If brain Aβ
aggregation and disease progression are secondary to early gut abnormalities, then creating gut inflammation
early in life will lead to loss of gut integrity, increased bacterial breach and subsequent bacterial amyloid
translocation and earlier brain Aβ aggregation. In Aim 2, we will determine if B12 receptor loss and/or B12
malabsorption leads to impaired myelination and earlier Aβ aggregation. In Aim 3, we will determine if preventing
gut dysfunction and restoring gut homeostasis with a beneficial bacterium (a B12 producer) improves absorption,
gut integrity and delays the onset or progression of AD. These studies represent a “translatable” foundation for
the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in humans"
10837051,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondria are central hubs of cellular metabolism, and their dysfunction is linked to a host of age-related and
metabolic disorders. As a major source of cellular energy production and metabolite biosynthesis, mitochondria
continually take up and release a variety of intracellular nutrients. This renders mitochondria vulnerable to
changes in nutrient concentrations frequently observed in disorders associated with metabolic overload. Indeed,
recent work from our lab showed that mitochondria are uniquely sensitive to elevations in intracellular amino acid
load, and that amino acid toxicity is a key driver of age-related mitochondrial decline. Moving forward, a major
goal of our lab is to understand mechanisms by which elevated amino acids impair mitochondrial function, and
identify pathways that protect mitochondria from amino acid stress. In work during the last project period, we
identified a key role for the amino acid cysteine in regulating mitochondrial respiration, and uncovered a new
cellular structure, called the Mitochondrial-Derived Compartment (MDC), that protects cells from harmful effects
of excess amino acids. Our current data suggests that MDCs are dynamic, organelle-like structures that are
generated from mitochondria in response to intracellular amino acid elevation. Upon formation, MDCs selectively
sort and remove proteins of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily, key mediators of metabolite transport across
the mitochondrial inner membrane, away from the rest of the mitochondrial network. MDCs are conserved from
yeast to humans, and loss of the MDC pathway renders cells susceptible to amino acid overload. These results
have led to our current working model that MDC formation represents a new mechanism to acutely regulate
mitochondrial nutrient transporters in response to changes in cellular metabolic supply. Currently, our
understanding of the biogenesis, nutrient regulation, and role of MDCs in cellular metabolism is far from complete.
During the next project period, we will work in both yeast and mammalian systems to elucidate mechanisms and
machinery involved in MDC biogenesis, identify nutrient cues and sensors that control MDC activation, and
determine the role of this pathway in mitochondrial and cellular metabolism. Because mitochondrial metabolite
transporters are key regulatory points of cellular metabolism, we anticipate that elucidating the function of this
new cellular pathway will have significant impact on our understanding of mitochondrial physiology and its role
in human disease."

NIDDK for twenty years, currently at the level of two pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral trainees per year. In
addition, the program supports four medical students each summer who receive short-term training as part of
the NIDDK Summer Medical Student Research Program. The goal of the Diabetes and Obesity Training Program
is to provide excellent training in research relevant to diabetes, metabolism, and obesity to researchers at an
early stage of their careers. This training program is led by two dedicated Co-Directors, Drs. R. Wek and C.
Evans-Molina, who are assisted by outstanding Executive and Selection Committees, with oversight and
guidance provided by an Advisory Committee of key internal advisors and world-renowned external advisors.
Twenty-five faculty preceptors from ten departments and five degree granting programs participate as mentors
in the program. This group of faculty has a strong training and research record and receives a total of $22.2M in
annual direct research funding, with $5.3M of this support coming from NIDDK R- and K-grants and $0.87M from
the JDRF and the ADA. In addition, this outstanding group of faculty has obtained $1.8M of U and P grant support
from the NIDDK. Pre-doctoral students in the training program complete a Minor in Diabetes and Obesity, which
includes a 2 credit Diabetes and Obesity course. Post-doctoral fellows also take this course. Students and post-
doctoral fellows attend and present their research at the Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases seminar
series and at national meetings such as the ADA Scientific Sessions. To ensure contemporary and well-rounded
training, scholars complete courses on the responsible conduct of research and rigor and reproducibility in
research. Trainees attend a Grant Writing Workshop, where they develop skills to enable them to successfully
apply for future grant funding. Training of scholars is guided by Individualized Development Plans and iterative
Program Evaluation. The program is committed to promoting diversity in biomedical sciences and, in the past
funding cycle, four of fourteen pre- and post-doctoral trainees and four of twenty one medical students were from
historically marginalized backgrounds. By training pre-doctoral students, post-doctoral fellows, and medical
students in an environment and culture that provides strong multi-disciplinary support for diabetes research and
an appreciation of diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, this program will educate trainees who have a
sustained interest in diabetes and who will contribute significantly to the field. The Indiana University School of
Medicine is an outstanding forum for such an initiative, as the School has strong traditions in diabetes research
and patient care, as well as comprehensive research training. This program will continue to meet a critical need
by recruiting, mentoring, and training a talented and diverse cadre of scientists who are poised to carry out
cutting-edge basic science and translational research focused on improving the health of individuals with or at
risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity, and their associated complications."

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth in cancer mortality for women, and it is the deadliest for all types
of gynecological cancers, affecting mainly postmenopausal women. In 80% of the cases the
diagnosis comes at stages III and IV with 28% survival rate. The standard of care of OC is
debulking surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. FDA-approved platinum (II)
compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin) present major drawbacks for OC which are: a)
the acquired resistance of cancer cells after treatment, and b) the lack of selectivity which causes
undesired secondary effects due to dose limiting effects. For as many as 62% patients the disease
will recur after receiving chemotherapy, and maintenance therapies are required. Modified Pt(IV)
compounds hold the potential to become alternatives to Pt(II)-based drugs, especially for OC, for
which resistance to the treatment is a major problem, and for which first-line chemotherapy
treatment may still be the most affordable option for years. This proposal aims to develop Platinum
(IV)-Gold anticancer agents with potential dual- or multi-drug effects with improved
pharmacological profile with respect to FDA-approved Pt(II) compounds. Our hypothesis is that
the reduction of the heterometallic Pt(IV) compounds inside OC cells, will release not only
conventional Pt(II) anticancer agents, but also highly cytotoxic gold derivatives that will target
different biomolecules in the tumors and favor immunogenic cell death, overriding resistance. The
specific aims of this proposal are: Aim 1. Synthesis and in vitro Evaluation of New Platinum(IV)-
Gold Compounds in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines. We will synthesize new Pt(IV)-Au(I) and Pt(IV)-
Au(III) compounds and study their stability and interactions with DNA (target for Pt(II)
compounds). We will evaluate their effects on a panel of epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines with
varying degrees of genetic complexity, as well as on non-tumorigenic cell lines. For selected
compounds, we will study their effects on other cancer hallmarks (migration, invasion and
angiogenesis), on cell death and cell cycle, and inhibition of gold compounds’ targets. Aim 2.
Optimize the Formulation and Targeting Properties of Selected Pt-Au Compounds. Preliminary in
vivo Investigation. We will encapsulate best performing Pt-Au compounds into liposomes and
immunoliposomes to further improve the safe delivery of these derivatives. In addition, we will
assess the survival of mice treated with two selected Pt-Au compound and their two formulations
(Pt-Au-Lip and Pt-Au-ImmunoLip) on a mouse metastatic orthotopic model (ovarian cell line
resistant to cisplatin, C200) and compare it to that of those treated with cisplatin and carboplatin."
10872215,"In this 5-year R01 project titled “Mapping of the intrinsic and extrinsic cerebellar connectome at ultra high
resolution with expert neuroanatomical curation,” we propose to create the first detailed atlas of the human
cerebellar connectome using sub-millimeter ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI (dMRI). The human cerebellar
connectome is affected in multiple conditions including autism, schizophrenia, Down's syndrome, Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar mutism, and neurodegeneration. The complex anatomy of the
cerebellar structural connectome includes intricate connections between the tightly foliated cerebellar cortex,
the deep cerebellar nuclei, and structures external to the cerebellum including the spinal cord, brainstem,
thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Remarkably, the cerebellum contains 80% of all neurons in the brain. Yet, a
complete map of the intrinsic and extrinsic structural connectome of the human cerebellum is still
lacking. Several challenges have prevented detailed mapping of the cerebellar structural connectome. First,
the limited spatial resolution of current state-of-the-art dMRI data prevents mapping of intricate connections
between the cerebellar cortex and small nuclei in the deep cerebellum, brainstem, and thalamus. Second,
cerebellar connectome mapping is further limited by abundant anatomical errors in existing dMRI tractography
algorithms, which do not respect known synapses and decussations or key nuclei. Third, our understanding of
human neuroanatomy relies heavily on the results of invasive tracer studies in monkeys, but the detailed
neuroanatomy of the cerebellar connectome in monkeys has not yet been systematically mined and compiled.
We propose to address these challenges to create the most comprehensive description of the cerebellar
connectome to date. Our strategy includes fast and distortion-free ultra-high-resolution dMRI acquisitions,
novel anatomically constrained and curated cerebellar tractography, deep learning joint parcellation of fibers
and nuclei for fine-grained atlasing, and expert neuroanatomical generation of the intrinsic and extrinsic
cerebellar connectivity matrices from non-human primate tracer studies. Overall, these steps will enable robust
in-vivo tracing of the cerebellar connectome of the human brain at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Our
final deliverable will be a comprehensive, anatomically curated atlas of the human cerebellar connectome,
which will enable the study of the cerebellar connectome in health and disease. We will publicly release the
atlas, the monkey connectivity matrices, all extracted fascicles, all acquired images, and all software as open
source."
10765669,"ABSTRACT
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is common among African American (AA) patients. The excess risk for CKD in
this population is partially explained by genetic variations in the APOL1 gene (named G1 and G2) that are unique
to African ancestral populations. Understanding the molecular basis for the association between genetic variants
and the risk for kidney disease is an important goal in biomedical science. The APOL1 gene is unique to humans
and a few primates creating limitations to research approaches using conventionally available experimental
models. This career development research proposal is designed to train a promising early stage investigator to
address these issues by using organotypic kidney models derived from human inducible stem cells (iPSC) in
conjunction with state-of-the-art bioinformatics to interrogate human patient data and explore therapeutics. The
current proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that APOL1 kidney disease risk variants drive
transcriptional differences that can be identified by the integration of glomerular transcriptomes from
people with APOL1-associated kidney disease and ex vivo models, to gain insight into APOL1 function
in health and disease. Key preliminary data developed by the applicant demonstrates that a variant-dependent
APOL1 transcriptional signatures identified in human glomeruli are conserved in mouse models expressing
APOL1 variants. The applicant will acquire new skills in two general areas: 1) expertise in the use of novel ex
vivo culture models for mechanistic studies, and 2) computational and bioinformatics analysis of large datasets.
These skills will be acquired through mentorship, didactics and a pragmatic research program divided into three
specific aims: 1) Define APOL1 risk genotype-associated transcriptional phenotypes in podocytes derived from
isogenic cell lines homozygous for the G0, G1 and G2 alleles that are anchored to human glomerular gene
expression; 2) Anchor APOL1 variants-associated podocyte transcriptional phenotypes to NEPTUNE glomerular
gene co-expression modules and clinical outcomes, and identity compounds that could modulate such
phenotypes and associated subcellular processes, and 3) Test the chemical perturbagens’ ability to reverse the
APOL1 risk genotype transcriptional phenotype and identify kidney disease mechanisms. Completion of this
proposal will provide insights into APOL1 biology and function that could be translated to clinical technology by
providing early diagnosis and prognosis tools, identification of therapeutic targets and patient derived renal
models. Additionally this proposal aims to establish the Principal Investigator (PI) as an independent translational
scientist in nephrology. The plan includes mentored training in patient oriented research, extensive wet-lab
training in the production of organotypic models from iPSC lines as well as comprehensive coursework in
bioinformatics."

The University of Iowa (UIowa) is poised to advance the field of cerebroprotection in patients with acute
ischemic stroke by remaining as a site for the NIH Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN)’s
translational research infrastructure to efficiently conduct rigorous and innovative comparative studies of
cerebroprotection in the context of reperfusion. UIowa-SPAN has consistently followed a rigorous, clinical
trial-like approach to avoid the methodological mistakes of past cerebroprotection research. Specifically, we
use randomization, blinded intervention, independent outcome adjudications, and intention-to-treat analyses
to interpret and report our animal studies. We also address the effect of sex and comorbidities to increase
the translational value of our research. UIowa-SPAN brings together a team of basic and translational
scientists that integrates technical expertise with logistics. This has resulted in the top performance during
the first iteration of SPAN, consistently leading the enrollment efficiency of the network while producing the
highest quality data based on the metrics. We aim to maintain or exceed this performance if selected as a
site in the new iteration of the network. Notably, the goals of UIowa-SPAN are aligned with those of UIowa’s
regional coordinating center for StrokeNet, a NIH clinical trial network with the mission of identifying and
testing promising stroke therapies. We are also proposing innovations to multiple aspects of the SPAN,
including minimizing overall data variability, technical improvements in the embolic clot rodent model, and
improvements to the internal validity of the current outcome measures, using artificial intelligence to
interpret corner tests and alternative computation methods for the grid walk test. Our goal is to rigorously
and efficiently identify which cerebroprotective interventions are likely to succeed in clinical trials in order to
improve the outcomes of the 800,000 Americans who suffer a stroke and are currently treated with
reperfusion strategies that have limited effectiveness."

Women have higher rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tend to show a more aggressive profile of AD than
men, with greater pathological tau burden and steeper cognitive decline. The prevalence of AD also differs by
race with higher rates among Black versus White older adults. Yet, very little is known about AD in Black
individuals given their historical exclusion in research. Even less is known about the intersection of race and sex
in AD. In this proposal, we aim to study how sex- and/or race-disparate biological (inflammation, insulin resistance
[IR]) pathways and physical activity potentially contribute to tau accumulation and cognitive decline specifically
among older Black women at-risk for AD. We focus on potentially modifiable risk/protective factors given the
recent surge in evidence that modification of these factors can be highly effective in delaying or even preventing
cognitive decline. Our own preliminary work indicated that women may be more susceptible than men to the
adverse effect of inflammation on levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and cognitive function. There is also
evidence that certain lifestyle factors, including physical activity, have a greater impact on AD-related outcomes
such as tau in women versus men. Given links between physical activity and inflammation, we propose to
investigate the interplay between inflammation and physical activity in their contributions to tau and cognitive
decline in older Black women at risk for AD. Since IR is a key driver of inflammation, and the rates of
prediabetes/diabetes are higher in Black adults, we will examine how IR impacts tau accumulation and cognitive
decline. It is critical to examine these relationships in the context of social determinants of health, which are a
driving factor in health outcomes such as inflammation and IR particularly in Black women. To achieve this, we
propose a prospective study that will assess all variables of interest and their interactive pathways. The proposed
study will build upon an ongoing pilot study that will collect these variables in 30 White women by study end
(June, 2022), but will represent a more targeted and less invasive study in order to enhance recruitment in the
understudied yet higher risk group of older Black women. We propose to recruit Black women at two sites, one
leveraging an existing research registry of Black women in Los Angeles, and the other leveraging local
community connections and previous research experience to create a new cohort in San Diego. We will use a
community-based participatory research approach to recruitment that involves decision making at each level
involving a Community Advisory Board. We will measure inflammatory markers in blood, IR, physical activity and
the Area Deprivation Index as our primary social determinant of interest in 100 Black women at-risk for AD and
relate these measures to changes in cognitive function and accumulation of tau, measured in plasma, over a
two-year period. This project will help to close critical gaps in our understanding of risk factors for AD in Black
women by examining biomarkers and social determinants of health in this under-researched yet highly-
vulnerable group. Furthermore, our findings will inform risk reduction strategies that influence these mechanisms."

Recent levels of the bacterial disease pertussis are at their highest in 60 years. While pertussis in
adolescents and adults is characterized by a persistent debilitating cough, pertussis in infants can
progress from respiratory symptoms to more severe and complicated disease. This often requires
hospitalization and admission to a pediatric intensive care unit, and pertussis still causes an alarming number of deaths in infants. However, no effective therapies exist for treatment of severe pertussis and we still have a relatively poor understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the nature of protective immune responses. Through RNAseq transcriptomics analysis we identified the type III interferon (IFNλ) receptor subunit, IFNLR1, as one of the most significant upstream activators of gene expression in the lungs of B. pertussis-infected adult mice during the inflammatory phase. Type III IFNs are key cytokines in immune responses and antiviral defense, but they also have diverse effects on inflammation and pathogenesis in models of infection and disease. We found that IFNλ signaling plays an important role in promoting lung inflammatory pathology in B. pertussis-infected adult mice. However, we have found that pertussis pathogenesis is markedly different in infant mice from that in adult mice, reflecting the age-dependent outcomes of infection in humans. Infected infant wild type mice (inoculated at 7 days of age) do not upregulate IFNλ expression and suffer a fatal disseminating infection with leukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension, features also seen in fatal pertussis cases in human infants. Infant IFNLR1 KO mice (in which IFNλ signaling is abrogated) inoculated at 7 days of age also suffered fatal pertussis infection, with deaths occurring in the same timeframe as those in wild type mice.
However, pertussis lethality is age-dependent in young mice, since wild type mice inoculated at 10 days of age survive infection with the same dose. In striking contrast, 80% of IFNLR1 KO mice inoculated at 10 days of age suffered fatal pertussis infection. We hypothesize that age-dependent IFNλ signaling plays an important role in protecting infants against severe and fatal pertussis, and that infants younger than a certain age fail to induce this protective IFNλ response. Therefore, the aims of this exploratory proposal are to (i) investigate age-dependent effects of the IFNλ signaling pathway on outcomes in B. pertussis-infected infant mice, and (ii) determine whether treatment with purified IFNλ provides protection against lethal B. pertussis infection in infant mice. These studies will increase our understanding of age-dependent IFNλ biology, reveal an important immune deficiency in infants that renders them susceptible to lethal pertussis infection and
identify a potential novel host-targeted treatment for severe pertussis that will help save the lives of infected infants."

Chromatin provides a means to compartmentalize the genome into active (euchromatin) and heritably repressed
(heterochromatin) states. Changes in these states accompany changes in cellular differentiation and are
essential for stabilizing cellular identity. Both types of chromatin states are maintained and rearranged by the
combined action of diverse ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling motors and specific chromatin binding
proteins. The proposed work is aimed at studying the core mechanisms of some of the major
chromatin regulators to achieve a better understanding of how their activities are regulated in vivo. Using a
variety of biophysical approaches, we have uncovered that ATP-dependent remodelers use sophisticated auto-
inhibition based mechanisms. We have also uncovered hexasomes as the preferred substrate for one type of
conserved remodeler. These findings provide a biophysical basis for further probing why different remodelers
have different biological roles. We had previously discovered phase-separation behavior by HP1 proteins, the
core components of heterochromatin. Since then, we have uncovered that phase-separated heterochromatin
reconstituted in a test-tube possesses several of the biophysical properties attributed to heterochromatin in cells.
Here we will build on these new discoveries to ask the following questions:
1. Why are their differences in mechanism between remodelers from different classes?
2. How does action of remodelers at the nucleosome scale impact chromatin at bigger scales?
3. What is the role of phase-separation in heterochromatin regulation?"

Women aged 50+ years comprise 77% of breast cancer diagnoses and 93% of all breast cancer survivors (BCS).
Unfortunately, the interaction between cancer treatment and normal aging often results in a number of health
sequelae. Up to 75% of BCS suffer cognitive changes during treatment, and over 45% experience clinically
significant cognitive decline pre- to post-treatment. An optimum treatment for cancer-related cognitive
impairment (CRCI) is likely one integrating interventions known to improve cognition in similar populations, such
as older adults. Our previous research supports the efficacy of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training for
improving cognitive function in older adults without cancer. This work suggests that cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e.,
peak VO2) and brain structural and functional integrity (e.g., white matter microstructure, resting state functional
connectivity) may underlie exercise-induced changes in cognitive function. We recently applied an aging
framework to gain preliminary information on the effects of physical activity on cognitive function in BCS. Our
work in this area suggests that aerobic exercise training may similarly ameliorate cognitive decline due to cancer
and that cancer-related fatigue may also represent a mechanism of exercise’s cognitive benefits in the context
of cancer. Our preliminary data in aging and cancer, along with the well-documented benefits of exercise relative
to proposed CRCI mechanisms (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue), provide a compelling argument in
support of aerobic exercise training for improving cognitive function in BCS. While evidence toward efficacy in
this area is growing, few large trials have been conducted and none, to our knowledge, with consideration of
dissemination and implementation a priori. We propose a clinical trial in which post-menopausal BCS (3-24
months post primary adjuvant therapy) will be randomized to a community-based aerobic exercise program or
attentional control. This study utilizes a Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation design to investigate clinical
effectiveness while gathering information on implementation success associated with our novel, community-
based approach. Our exercise protocol is based upon our previous studies with demonstrated efficacy in older
adults, and our community-based approach is based upon our previous studies with demonstrated
implementation success in BCS and post-menopausal women without cancer. The specific aims are: 1) Examine
the effectiveness of a 6-month, community-based aerobic exercise program, compared to control, on indicators
of cognitive function (i.e., cognitive performance, neuroimaging metrics of brain health, self-reported cognitive
impairment) in post-menopausal BCS; and 2) Gather information on the intervention’s potential for scalability as
defined by the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance). We will
also explore intervention interactions with clinical variables (e.g., moderators: chemotherapy treatment regimen,
obesity status) and potential pathways by which aerobic exercise, compared to control, influences cognitive
function (i.e., mediators: neuroimaging outcomes, cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue)."

Our research is focused on understanding how the local chromatin environment regulates DNA-templated pro-
cesses like transcription and DNA replication. We have developed and pioneered the use of factor-agnostic
approaches to map chromatin occupancy at nucleotide resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome. We have
used this approach to provide mechanistic insights into how the local chromatin environment mediates origin se-
lection and activation. In order to identify the chromatin changes that occur with helicase activation at the onset of
S-phase, we depleted cells of functional DNA polymerase alpha (Pol a) to prevent the priming of DNA synthesis.
Activation of the helicase in the absence of priming not only resulted in the local disruption of chromatin, but
also resulted in the uncoupling of the helicase from DNA synthesis and the unwinding of approximately 1 kb of
DNA surrounding each activated origin. We will identify the mechanism(s) which regulate helicase progression
in the absence of DNA replication with a focus on sequence, topological and rad53-mediated signaling. A conse-
quence of the helicase traveling away from the origin in each direction and stalling is that upon restoration of Pol a
priming, the helicase is oriented to travel away from the origin and thus will leave an unreplicated gap. These un-
replicated gaps are a unique molecular intermediate that are analogous to intermediates predicted to occur from
termination defects and provide a unique opportunity to identify factors involved in their resolution. We will also
examine the role of speciﬁc histone chaperones in the spatiotemporal deposition of nucleosomes behind the DNA
replication fork and how speciﬁc genomic features like active transcription may impact the maturation process in
a locus speciﬁc manner. Finally, we have generated chromatin occupancy proﬁles for 201 yeast deletion mutants
representing non-essential transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. Combining the chromatin occupancy
proﬁles with gene expression data, we will be able to generate gene regulatory networks that are more accurately
able to deﬁne direct and indirect targets."

The circadian clock is necessary to synchronize biological processes with daily changes in the environment, but
it is also required for organisms to measure photoperiod (daylength) and align physiology with the seasons.
Rapid progress has been made in understanding the transcriptional connections that drive daily and seasonal
timing. We know less about how post-translational mechanisms, such as protein degradation regulate the
circadian clock and seasonal timing. Plants, such as Arabidopsis, have served as preeminent model systems for
understanding the circadian clock, and in particular, how the circadian clock mediates photoperiod measurement.
In the period of funding from the previous MIRA award, my laboratory has worked at the interface of protein
degradation and the circadian clock, discovering protein degradation mechanisms that regulate the circadian
clock and seasonal physiology. During the funding period, we also discovered that one of the E3 ubiquitin ligases
in our study is controlled by a non-canonical photoperiod measurement system in plants, opening a new, but
complementary, avenue of research in our lab. Our future work will build on these foundational studies by
addressing two major goals 1) performing detailed investigations of three E3 ubiquitin ligase families that control
important clock output processes and 2) continuing to identify and study non-canonical photoperiod
measurement systems in plants.
These studies will uncover general principles about how the circadian clock controls daily and seasonal biology.
The circadian clock regulates fundamental biological processes in many organisms, and clock dysfunction
increases the prevalence of human disease and mood disorders. Thus, the work that we perform will have far-
reaching impacts and fits the goals of NIGMS because: 1) it will provide basic principles and molecular logic for
eukaryotic circadian clock systems, 2) it will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the post-
translational mechanisms that overlay transcriptional feedback loops of clocks, and 3) it will serve as a framework
for similar studies in other eukaryotic timing systems, including humans."

The Next Generation Sequencing Shared Resource (NGS-SR) provides the University of Florida Health Cancer
Center (UFHCC) members with access to centralized, state-of-the-art, cost-effective next generation sequencing
services to advance cancer research. The NGS-SR is an institutionally-managed shared resource supported by
UFHCC through a partnership with the UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, a campus-wide
shared biotechnology resource. Located within the Cancer & Genetics Research Complex providing convenient
access for UFHCC members, NGS-SR includes 4 staff members under the supervision of Moraga, who has over
30 years of experience in DNA sequencing technologies. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the NGS-SR
was identified as an essential campus resource and remained staffed and open to the UF research community.
NGS-SR service requests and invoicing are managed via the CrossLab laboratory management system. Key
sequencing technologies available include instruments from Illumina (NovaSeq6000, MiSeq), PacBio SEQUEL
IIe, Oxford Nanopore PromethION, and the 10x Genomics Chromium single-cell RNA-Seq and VISIUM spatial
transcriptomics platforms. Raw sequencing read data are directly transferred to the HiPerGator high-
performance computing cluster for downstream bioinformatics analysis. UFHCC investments in instrumentation
include the Illumina NovaSeq6000, PacBio SEQUEL IIe, mosquito® liquid handling robot, and 10x Genomics
Chromium single cell platform. The NGS-SR works in collaboration with the UFHCC Biostatistics and

sequencing costs by 50% and the use of robotics has reduced RNA-Seq library prep costs by 75%. In alignment
with the UFHCC Strategic Plan, Momentum 2027, the demand for NGS-SR services is anticipated to grow with
recruitments in molecular epidemiology, immunobiology, and RNA epigenetics. In response, NGS-SR will
continue to lower costs through increased automation, expand services including spatial transcriptomics, and
adopt new technologies to increase capabilities in cost effective single cell transcriptomics."
10852875,"The 26S proteasome is a massive, intricately regulated ATP-dependent protease responsible for the
degradation of most cellular proteins. The goal of this research program is to determine how degradation by
the 26S proteasome is regulated by deubiquitinases. Since misregulation of protein degradation is a hallmark
of many human cancers and neurological disorders, the results of these studies can be used to design new
drugs that target key regulators of the 26S proteasome. A major focus of this research program will be on the
deubiquitinase UCHL5/UCH37, which is recruited to the proteasome by the ubiquitin-binding receptor
ADRM1/RPN13. Deficiencies in UCH37 leads to embryonic lethality in mice and overexpression of UCH37
along with RPN13 is associated with poor prognoses in several cancers. A combination of x-ray
crystallography, NMR, in vitro biochemistry, protein engineering, and cell-based approaches will be used to
understand how UCH37 selects its ubiquitin chain targets, why the cleavage of those targets is necessary for
promoting proteasomal degradation, and which proteins in a cellular proteome require UCH37 activity for
efficient degradation. We will also develop a set of single-chain antibodies (referred to as nanobodies) capable
of interfering with distinct activities of UCH37. These new tools will be instrumental in defining the function of
UCH37 in different biochemical pathways such as the cell cycle and the cellular response to oxidative stress
and DNA damage. Considering the tumor suppressor BAP1 shares a similar sequence with the catalytic
domain of UCH37, our tools and approaches can also be used to better understand its role outside of histone
deubiquitination. The molecular insights that will result from the proposed studies will provide a foundation for
the development of new therapeutic agents that target cancers requiring excessive proteasome activity for
survival."

Chemokines are a family of small cytokines best known for their ability to guide directed migration of cells
expressing corresponding chemokine receptors. In addition to their activities in recruiting leukocytes for
inflammatory reactions, emerging evidence has revealed that chemokines can also modulate the activities of
many non-immune cells, such as endothelial cells, fibroblast, adipocytes, and tumor cells, among others, by
binding to chemokine receptors expressed on these cells. The C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2, also
known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1) and its main receptor CCR2, a G protein-coupled
receptor, have been receiving particular interest for their involvement in the pathogenesis of many diseases,
including neurological diseases, atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and various types of cancer. However, the
intracellular mediators of CCL2-CCR2 signaling are largely unknown. Moreover, although blocking CCL2-
CCR2 axis was found to be effective in several preclinical disease models, clinical trial studies of these
inhibitors have shown a lack of effect, likely due to developed compensation by other chemokines and/or
chemokine receptors for the loss of function of CCL2-CCR2 axis. However, the compensatory chemokines/
chemokine receptors for CCL2-CCR2 axis have been poorly defined. It is our goal for next five years to
elucidate the intracellular mediators of CCL2-CCR2 signaling as well as the compensatory machinery for this
axis in prostate cancer models particular under obese condition. Another area of research in my laboratory is
the discovery of bioactive natural compounds. Natural compounds particularly phytochemicals are a major
source for developing non-toxic preventive/therapeutic agents. Phytochemicals typically target multiple
dysregulated signaling pathways involved in the development of polygenic diseases such as cancer, obesity
and diabetes, therefore they may be able to provide a durable control of these diseases. However, the low
bioavailability of most phytochemicals limits their efficacy in humans, and their effective doses as observed in
vitro can barely be achieved in vivo. Discovery of highly effective phytochemicals with favorable bioavailability
is therefore an urgent task of global priority in disease control. In our preliminary study we have identified that
arctigenin, a novel anti-inflammatory lignan mainly from the herb Arctium lappa, was a potent inhibitor of
various types of cancer cells with a potentially favorable bioavailability. Arctigenin has also shown to be anti -
oxidant, -viral, -obesity, -diabetes, -osteoporosis, -cardiovascular diseases, -neurological diseases, and
immune modulatory. Our next five years’ goal in this line of research is to fully characterize arctigenin in terms
of its direct and indirect molecular targets, pharmacokinetics, and its potential influence on drug-metabolizing
enzymes. The overall vision of my research program is to provide essential scientific knowledge and agents to
improve the prevention and treatment of certain chronic disease including obesity and cancer, and to improve
the quality of life of patients and their families."

Advances in eukaryotic gene expression have provided a comprehensive list of transcription-related proteins,
their biochemical activities and structure-function relationships, and revealed the importance of histone

enhancers. However, major challenges remain in the lack of knowledge of the timescales and kinetics by which

challenges by focusing on quantitative kinetics of chromatin remodeling and transcription, using state-of-the-art
single-molecule imaging techniques applied to living cells and immobilized chromatin templates in vitro,

10829901,"Mitochondrial stress shapes host responses to bacterial infection
Project Summary
The mitochondrial network is a central hub for metabolism and sensing cellular stress, critical to shaping
the immune response to infection. Cardiolipin (CL), an anionic phospholipid found in bacteria and in
the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), anchors multi-protein respiratory chain complexes to the
membrane and may also be deployed to nucleate immune supramolecular organizing centers such as
the inflammasome. In conditions of stress, such as infection, cardiolipin is thought to translocate to the
outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) or the extracellular space. The regulatory steps that control CL
translocation, remodeling and CL-dependent immune responses during bacterial infection are poorly
understood. Mutations in the human CL remodeling enzyme, Tafazzin, result in an X-linked multi-
system disorder known as Barth Syndrome, commonly associated with recurrent bacterial infections.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which CL localization,
modification and signaling enable mitochondrial control of the innate immune response to bacterial
pathogens. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that CL translocation and modification regulates
the switch between homeostatic and stress-responsive functions to drive innate immune responses to
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we will perturb
macrophage CL at four different steps: global biosynthesis, OMM-localization, oxidation and
remodeling and define the signaling and effector mechanisms that are CL-dependent in the context of
MRSA infection. Under these four experimental conditions, we will quantitatively track CL membrane
localization and intracellular trafficking in macrophages using super resolution microscopy coupled with
biochemical approaches. Finally, we will study the innate immune response to MRSA skin and soft
tissue infection in mice genetically deficient in OMM-localized CL or enzymatically remodeled CL. We
will also test the contribution of oxidized CL to in vivo antibacterial responses by treating MRSA-infected
mice with a CL-targeted antioxidant. These studies will yield mechanistic insight into CL localization
and remodeling during innate immune responses and potentially identify therapeutic targets for
productively modulating inflammation. Additionally, this work will help contextualize CL-dependent
innate immune signaling within the framework of a clinically relevant pathogen in vivo."

Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe acute
pain, but their high abuse liability and risk for lethal overdose have exacted a significant toll on public
health in recent years. Our program of study has investigated the feasibility of combining MOR
agonists with kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists to deter abuse and enhance pain-decreasing
effects. Our findings from Project Period 1 of this program indicate that the atypical KOR agonist,
nalfurafine, decreases oxycodone’s abuse-related effects and enhances analgesia, but nalfurafine
also produced significant sedative effects on its own. Recently, new KOR agonists have been
developed that are reported to produce even fewer of the adverse behavioral effects that are typical
of the KOR-agonist class. These atypical KOR agonists have been described as “G-protein biased”
due to their greater potency to activate G-protein signaling relative to other pathways at the KOR. Our
preliminary data indicate that the biased KOR agonist, triazole 1.1, is more therapeutically selective
than nalfurafine. However, it is unknown if the positive characteristics observed with triazole 1.1 are
due to G-protein bias or other potential mechanisms peculiar to the structural class. The overall goal
of this renewal application is to systematically investigate combinations of oxycodone with new
atypical KOR agonists that are reported to be G-protein biased from different structural classes to
determine if reported signaling bias is associated with increased therapeutic selectivity (decreased
abuse potential; enhanced antinociception) and reduced KOR-mediated “side effects”. To accomplish
this goal, we will use complementary animal models (rhesus monkeys and rats) and rigorous
quantitative pharmacology to determine if the atypical KOR agonists can reduce oxycodone’s abuse-
related effects (Specific Aim 1), augment oxycodone’s pain-decreasing effects (Aim 2), and produce
fewer side effects when combined with oxycodone (Aim 3). We will relate the relative potencies of the
various KOR agonists to produce therapeutic and unwanted side effects to identify optimal leads for
future development of therapeutics that activate MORs and KORs (dual-acting molecules; drug
combinations). The studies proposed in this renewal will positively impact public health by laying the
groundwork for the development of non-addictive pain medications that will retain the high treatment
efficacy of current prescription opioids."

Rare loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in SETD1A are strongly associated with schizophrenia (SZ), a debilitating mental disorder affecting 1% of the population, and other severe neurodevelopmental disorders. SETD1A encodes a component of the histone methyltransferase complex producing mono-, di, and trimethylated histone H3 at Lysine 4 (H3K4). H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K4me1 are epigenomic marks of active gene transcriptional promoters and enhancers, respectively. Interestingly, histone methylation has also been suggested as one of the most enriched gene pathways in common variant-based genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) of major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a recent mouse model with heterozygous knockout of SETD1A exhibited working memory deficits and showed transcriptional changes that overlap with those implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, however, seemingly independent from a H3K4me3 mechanism. Therefore, it remains largely unclear whether and how SETD1A causes SZ-relevant molecular and cellular changes in a human brain. Our central hypothesis is that human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal cells and cortical organoids recapitulate key SZ-relevant epigenetic, molecular and cellular properties of SETD1A LoF in the human brain. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we have generated isogenic hiPSC lines carrying heterozygous LoF mutations (in exon 4 and exon 16, on different genetic backgrounds) of SETD1A. Preliminary results showed that mutant lines were defective in cortical organoid development with premature neuronal differentiation at early developmental stages. Furthermore, morphological, electrophysiological and transcriptomic analyses of hiPSC neurons carrying SETD1A LoF mutation showed defective synaptic neurotransmission. Interestingly, genes showing differential expression in both 3D cortical organoids and 2D cultures from mutant lines are enriched for common GWAS risk variants of SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders/traits, suggesting possible convergent pathways shared by SETD1A LoF and common GWAS risk variants of major psychiatric disorders. Leveraging our respective expertise in hiPSC models and neurogenesis, synaptic physiology and functional genomics within our team, we propose to characterize the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the deficits associated with SZ-associated LoF mutations in SETD1A in human neural systems. We will identify the cell-type-specific and developmental stage-specific cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with SETD1A LoF in cortical organoids, and then investigate the synaptic phenotype(s) of SETD1A LoF mutations in human neurons and associated transcriptome changes. The proposed study will enable us to perform a well-controlled assessment of the impact of SETD1A LoF mutations on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying deficits in early neurodevelopment and synaptic properties."

Prediabetes, a comorbidity of obesity and a precursor of type 2 diabetes, affects more than one-half of women over
60 years of age. Obesity has multiple causes; however, it is known that obese insulin resistant individuals have a
reduced ability to alter resting and stimulated lipolysis (fat breakdown). This lack of flexibility to respond to stimuli
that regulate lipolysis has been attributed, almost entirely through studies in males, to changes in the predominant
(catecholamine-mediated) lipolytic pathway. Our published preliminary data demonstrate that acute resistance
exercise increases lipolysis in non-obese women. Published data also indicate that resistance exercise, like
endurance exercise, increases lipolytic sensitivity in men. However, the alterations in lipolytic response due to
resistance, as compared to endurance, training matched for energy expenditure have not been investigated. It is
also unknown how training alters lipolysis during general physical activity (walking), which accounts for the majority
of activity people engage in during a typical day outside of planned exercise. Furthermore, the lack of prior
investigations in this area in women points to the need for resistance training studies of fat metabolism in women
to determine if resistance training is as effective as endurance training. Therefore, the overall objective of this
study is to compare the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training to endurance training with respect to fat
metabolism, with a focus on lipolysis in postmenopausal women with obesity and prediabetes. Our central
hypothesis is that both 12 weeks of resistance training and 12 weeks of endurance training will increase lipolytic
flexibility. We will compare the effects of endurance training to the effects imparted by calorie-matched endurance
exercise training. We will determine with powerful in-vivo microdialysis and stable isotope methodologies the extent
to which 12 weeks of resistance training, as compared to calorie-matched endurance training: a) increases physical
activity (walking)-stimulated whole-body and regional lipolysis (Aim 1); b) increases local adrenergic regulation of
lipolysis in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue (Aim 2); and c) increases insulin-mediated
suppression of whole-body and regional lipolysis (Aim 3) in postmenopausal women with obesity and prediabetes.
Secondarily, fat oxidation, lipogenesis and adipogenesis in adipose tissue, as well as lipolytic activity in skeletal
muscle, will also be studied to develop a global understanding of fat metabolism response to resistance exercise
training. In addition, we will investigate the influence of resistance and endurance training on glucose profile under
laboratory as well as free-living conditions, as poor glucose control is linked to the aberrant lipid metabolism
commonly associated with obesity. These studies will provide a greater understanding of how these exercise
modalities affect metabolism in women with obesity and prediabetes, allowing practitioners to make more evidence-
based exercise prescriptions intended to improve body composition, glycemic control, and weight management."
10800696,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The overall goal of our proposed research is to understand why having health care coverage (or eligibility
for health care coverage) is not sufficient to allow equal access to elective surgical care. Despite successful
efforts to expand coverage through Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially elective
surgical care is often not addressed until it becomes an emergency. These patients tend to come from
vulnerable populations, who not only present more often for Emergency General Surgery (EGS), but
experience worse outcomes and greater costs. The disparities leading to this presentation in the United States
have been well-described in terms of overall relationship to insurance status, race and income, but deeper data
collection and analysis are desperately needed to identify modifiable factors that can inform interventions
around decreasing emergent presentation in these populations, particularly in regard to health care coverage.
Even in countries with Universal Health Care systems, disparities are noted in how people are able to actually
access those services.
 We initially studied this problem in the context of emergent cholecystectomy, one of our most common
presentations of EGS disease. We found that lack of health care coverage was not a major factor; in fact, 86%
of our patients had some type of coverage (29% private, 57% public), and many other social factors led to an
emergency operation. We now seek to expand and explore this in detail for the other EGS conditions defined
by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) using a multiphase mixed method approach.
We will 1) identify modifiable factors for emergent presentation and explore the trajectory of progression to
elective versus emergency surgery using billing data and EHR in a convergent mixed-methods design,
combining quantitative variables with qualitative narrative data, 2) identify and quantify additional modifiable
factors from the patient perspective that are not available in clinical or administrative datasets using an
exploratory sequential design, using identified domains to conduct systematic review and meta-analysis for
quantitative data, and 3) determine which modifiable factor or factors identified will have the greatest impact for
future intervention strategies using Markov modeling.
 This proposal will leverage our ability to link data from multiple sources in novel ways, our diverse, robust
general surgery population in a Medicaid expansion state, and Co-Investigators who are expert in their fields of
longitudinal data modeling and mixed methods research. With this data we can model and understand what
influences the persistent disparity in the ability to access elective surgical care despite increased coverage,
and predict which factors contribute the most to the disparities and thus hold potential for the greatest impact.
By identifying actionable modifiable factors, we will ultimately inform effective intervention strategies to prevent
emergent presentation of elective surgical disease."

As the nation continues to grapple with a rapidly changing epidemic of opioid overdose and mortality, there has
been increasing public attention devoted to expanding access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. While
Medicaid is positioned to be a key policy lever to improve access to OUD treatment and reduce mortality
among vulnerable populations, many state Medicaid programs do not cover the full continuum of OUD
treatment and use utilization management parameters that may restrict access. Moreover, most state Medicaid
programs contract with managed care organizations (MCOs). While over 70% of all Medicaid enrollees
participate in MCO plans, little is known about how these plans cover OUD treatment. To fill this gap in the
scientific evidence, we will conduct the first multi-state study of the effects of Medicaid MCO coverage and
utilization management design on OUD treatment receipt and outcomes. The study will break new ground by
encompassing all MCO plans, across multiple states, for the full continuum of treatment. We also propose to
make use of innovative random auto-assignment methods in two state Medicaid programs. Our specific aims
will include: estimating how state Medicaid program contractual regulations and oversight are associated with
MCO plan level coverage and utilization design; estimating how MCO plans’ coverage and utilization
management design are associated with progression through the Cascade of Care (diagnosis, engagement,
medication initiation, and retention); and estimating how MCO plans’ coverage and utilization management
parameters are associated with opioid-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality.
The proposed study will be the first comprehensive investigation of the effects of MCO coverage for OUD
treatment services and medications on treatment receipt and outcomes – evidence without which the care of a
large fraction of the OUD population is compromised. The study will also produce new insight into how states
are regulating and monitoring MCO plan coverage and utilization management design. In the midst of the
deadliest drug epidemic in the nation’s history, evidence regarding the impact of Medicaid MCO coverage for
OUD treatment is urgently needed. This research will equip policymakers with evidence-based guidance on
how to structure MCO contractual arrangements to ensure appropriate and efficient access to OUD treatment."
10833072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ovaries contain a finite resource of potential eggs and sex hormone-producing cells, and therefore, life-
saving cancer treatments that irradiate or chemically induce cell death within the ovaries will likely result in
premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) with reduced ovarian hormones and infertility. The option to have biological
children, is a key quality of life measure for cancer survivors. Women with POI will experience co-morbidities
associated with loss of ovarian hormones and a shorter life expectancy. The only method for fertility preservation
for pediatric patients, who do not yet make eggs, is ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC). This tissue can then
be transplanted back to restore fertility and hormone function. However, only 20 – 30% of transplants result in
livebirth and it produces an average of 2 – 5 years of hormone restoration, leaving many without biological
children and decades of post-cancer survival without essential hormone production. One major contributor to the
shortened function of transplanted ovarian tissue is the significant spike in activation of the ovarian reserve
(primordial follicles) and subsequent depletion, at least in part, due to the disruption in the microenvironment.
Additionally, some patients have metastatic disease within the ovary and therefore cannot use that tissue in its
current form. Therefore, a safe, long-term solution for fertility and hormone restoration would involve isolating
the ovarian cells that are essential for function from potential cancer cells and housing them in a
microenvironment that maintains the bank of potential eggs and prolongs hormone production. We have
previously developed an engineered 3D printed scaffold that restored fertility and hormone function in mice. We
will test the hypothesis that the matrisome imposes biochemical and physical cues that controls primordial follicle
activation. Additionally, we predict that the contribution of stromal cells is necessary for full folliculogenesis. We
will use cow ovaries as mono-ovulatory models of human ovaries. In Aim 1, we will investigate the biochemical
cues of the matrisome and how they regulate primordial follicle activation, by defining the matrisome proteins
that exist in the ovary and modulating candidate proteins that may be key to controlling primordial follicle
activation through extracellular inhibition or induction of intracellular pathways. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
physical properties of the ovary and how they control primordial follicle quiescence, by defining the native
stiffness of the ovarian microenvironment and monitoring how primordial follicles response to different physical
properties in culture. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of stromal cells in folliculogenesis supported by a
transplantable scaffold. We will define the matrisome proteins and paracrine factors that are secreted by stromal
cells and investigate how they contribute to folliculogenesis within a 3D printed bioprosthetic scaffold in a
transplant model. The aims in this application will build on our previous successes and a bioprosthetic ovary,
defined by the results here, would improve current options for fertility and hormone restoration for women."

the Regional Medical Library (RML) for the newly established Region 2 - Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. Communities within this Region face several challenges related to the impact of health
inequities, poverty, natural disasters, and lack of access to broadband internet. RML staff will
use a multi-pronged approach to build and sustain positive working relationships with regional
members that apply a variety of communication and engagement strategies. The RML will
provide members with alternative pathways to engage with Region 2, NNLM, NNLM Office and
Centers, and NLM missions. These alternative pathways will include training, funding,

implementing improvements in the I-SPY2.2 trial that employs early escalation/de-escalation of treatment and identifies
treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes within a regulatory evidence generation framework. The primary aims
of the Communications, Administration, Advocacy, and Project management (CAAP) Core are to ensure program
integration, collaboration, patient acceptance, and regulatory compliance by providing project management, leadership,
and administrative support to all Projects and Cores; as well as the integration of advocacy in all patient-facing aspects of
the Projects and Core in the Program Project.
Perhaps the most critical role of the CAAP core is to coordinate the activities and deliverables of the projects and cores
with the study sponsor QLHC, its clinical operations team and the I-SPY2 trial working group chairs. While program
project personnel, cores and projects are tasked with developing and refining the technical and methodological advances
required in the continuous improvement approach employed in I-SPY2.2, all operational aspects of the trial are the
responsibility of the study sponsor. The Program Project overall PIs and project PIs, facilitated by the CAAP core, work
to integrate the changes into the operations of the trial with sponsor representatives by defining the technical
requirements, specifications, and deliverables for the sponsor’s clinical operations team.
Among its other responsibilities, the CAAP Core ensures that our patient advocates are represented on all project teams,
cores teams and inter-project collaborations, so that they can bring their unique and important perspective to help meet the
patient-centric mandate of I-SPY2.2.
Specific Aim 1: Organize, integrate, and provide administrative management of all Projects and Core
Specific Aim 2: Provide project management oversight to track milestones and timelines of the individual Projects and

10804645,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ischemic heart disease is a major cause of death in the United States. At the cellular level, myocardial
ischemia alters excitation-contraction coupling and promoted the development of heart failure. Junctophilin-2
(JPH2) is an inter-membrane linker protein that maintains the plasmalemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
at a fixed distance to facilitate excitation-contraction coupling. Ischemia/reperfusion injury and ischemic heart
disease lead to a loss of JPH2 protein levels, which in part is caused by proteolysis by the Ca2+-sensitive
enzyme calpain. Our long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by
which calpain causes JPH2 cleavage and how the ensuing JPH2 C-terminal peptide alters myocardial function.
We will test the central hypothesis that calpain cleaves JPH2 to release a C-terminal peptide that traffics into
the cardiomyocyte nucleus where it alters CaMKII-d splicing which affects myocardial remodeling."

 The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) for low-income people with HIV (PWH) is a key resource for
reducing HIV health disparities and scaling up evidence-based interventions. As RWHAP serves >50% of US
PWH, RWHAP outcomes are vital to achieving “getting to zero”/ Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Plan targets.
 As a grantee for RWHAP Part A (RWPA) funding distributed to the counties/cities severely affected by HIV,
New York City (NYC) conducts regular HIV care continuum monitoring citywide and in its RWPA programs,
which offer support services to reduce social and behavioral barriers to care/treatment. Local data consistently
show lower viral suppression (VS) among RWPA clients in HIV care than among non-RWPA PWH in HIV care.
Relative to NYC HIV cases overall, NYC RWPA clients (~14,000 per year) over-represent Black and Latinx
PWH and high-poverty neighborhoods. To address local outcome disparities and to fill gaps left by data-to-care
(D2C) strategies and research focused on medical care (re-)linkage, we propose to implement and rigorously
evaluate the effectiveness of a novel ‘data-to-suppression’ (D2S) intervention among ~1,300 RWPA clients in
HIV care but unsuppressed. Surveillance-based reports on unsuppressed clients plus D2S capacity-building
assistance will guide RWPA providers in targeting and delivering evidence-informed strategies to improve VS.
 Our proposed aims are to: 1) Measure D2S intervention effects on timely VS and time to VS, in a stepped-
wedge hybrid Type 1 trial; 2) Identify modifiable determinants of D2S response, by comparing characteristics of
D2S-exposed clients who do and do not achieve VS, to recognize opportunities to tailor and strengthen the
intervention; 3) Assess D2S acceptability and participant preferences and priorities for its implementation, in
eight (client and provider) focus groups and in a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with RWPA staff (n=200).
 This proposal answers the call in PAR-20-036 for research to deepen understanding of the broader context
of VS, by leveraging extensive/multiple datasets and resources and applying implementation science
methods to test an intervention to improve service delivery and ultimately achieve VS. The study is also
aligned with the National HIV/AIDS Strategy goal to reduce health disparities – in this case, a VS gap between
RWPA clients in care and other PWH in care in the same jurisdiction. The proposed study’s hybrid, Type 1 trial
design supports rapid dissemination and uptake beyond NYC, should the intervention prove effective. Through
the D2S trial, analysis of factors driving D2S response, and primary data collection in NYC RWPA support-
service settings, the project seeks to clarify future intervention directions for low-income, Black and Latinx
PWH, whose care continuum advances are vital for meeting 90-90-90, “getting to zero” and EHE Plan goals.
The project’s potential impact is heightened in the time of COVID-19, given disproportionate burden of COVID-
19 and related restrictions in the communities RWPA serves, and new obstacles to continuity of care/treatment
and to maintaining close communication between medical and support-service providers about clients’ needs."
10863877,"High intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major causal risk factor for glaucoma and is the target of all
current glaucoma therapies. Although the importance of the LMX1B genes in human primary
open-angle glaucoma (POAG) has clearly been demonstrated, the mechanisms by which
LMX1B mutations induce IOP elevation and glaucoma are not known. This project investigates
the molecular mechanism by which abnormalities in LMX1B impact IOP and contribute to
glaucoma. It will generate a more sophisticated understanding of a human glaucoma gene,
ultimately guiding new treatments. Additionally, it will provide well characterized LMX1B
glaucoma models to the community. Current IOP-lowering drugs are not effective in many
patients, and reduce IOP by no more than 25-30%. Surgery to provide new aqueous humor
(AQH) outlets often fails due to scar formation. Therefore, new IOP-lowering therapies are a
critical need. New pathways and candidate molecules must be identified to advance
development of more potent and specific anti-glaucoma targets. The specific nature of an
inherited LMX1B variant is suggested to contribute to differences in glaucoma subtype and
disease severity between individuals. We hypothesize that various LMX1B mutations have
differential mechanistic effects - affecting LMX1B function or the function of other proteins that
interact with LMX1B to regulate transcriptional activity/specificity. Our preliminary data support
this hypothesis. We will test our hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1) Determine the impact
of selected Lmx1b mutations on phenotype and protein stability/function. Aim 2): Determine the
molecular mechanism by which Lmx1b mutations impact IOP. Aim 3) Determine if Lmx1b
impacts cellular metabolism and test a resilience boosting treatment."
10840884,"Language treatments for chronic aphasia are not restorative, and the psychosocial and economic impacts of
aphasia are devastating. Knowledge of modifiable brain targets has not been harnessed to catalyze meaningful treatment outcomes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows systematic investigations of the
effects of brain target engagement. tDCS investigations aim to restore a left hemisphere bias for language processing. tDCS has strong clinical translational potential, but the diffuse current flow it delivers to the stroke
brain and uncontrolled cortical dosage limits inferential precision. Although tDCS could be used to shape hemispheric contributions to language and investigate target engagement, methodological approaches so far have
not employed it for that purpose, preventing vertical progress in aphasia treatment development. Both aphasia
and tDCS research are lacking data on meaningful language outcomes and treatment-induced brain changes.
There is a critical need for rigorous investigations of treatments capable of coaxing spared brain areas into
adaptive participation for functional improvements. Failure to meet this need means that millions of people with
aphasia will have little hope for easing of disability burden. The long-term goal is to optimize aphasia recovery
with clinically translatable brain-based approaches. The overall objective of this project is to determine how to
induce functional language improvement and adaptive changes to spared eloquent language cortex. The central hypothesis is that functional language outcomes for people with chronic aphasia will be enhanced when
treatment focuses on normalizing language processing bias to the left hemisphere. The rationale is that identifying behavioral and adjunctive treatments that engage brain targets will allow optimization of treatment parameters and facilitate the development of novel and personalized approaches to move beyond the status quo and
towards precision neurorehabilitation. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Demonstrate the enhancing effect of targeted right hemisphere modulation; and 2)
Measure normalization of brain activity following treatment. Under the first aim, language treatment will be
paired with active or sham HD-tDCS to inhibit right inferior frontal right gyrus (pars triangularis), after which
gains in narrative and naming will be measured and the two groups compared. Under the second aim, changes
in EEG measures of brain function will be characterized and related to narrative and naming outcomes. This
contribution will be significant because it is expected to have broad application to clinical populations who
would benefit from treatment-induced adaptive brain reorganization. Our major innovation for this project is the
pairing of a proven behavioral treatment that will recruit language networks with targeted “high-definition” tDCS
(HD-tDCS) to focus inhibition and control cortical dosage to the frontal right hemisphere. These contributions
will be important for the more than 2.4 million adults in the United States living with aphasia."

Carbapenem-resistance in Enterobacterales has steadily increased over the past decade, leading to multidrug
and pan-drug resistance (MDR/PDR), further emphasizing the need for new innovative therapies. Carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is a serious global health problem classified by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention as an “Urgent threat” and by the World Health Organization as a “Priority 1 critical threat”.
The β-lactams have long been the front line therapeutic option for such infections, but efficacy of these agents,
including last resort carbapenems, is threatened by recent expansion of β-lactamases, particularly subtypes
(e.g., NDM) spreading rapidly among Enterobacterales that are unaffected by clinically-available β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combinations. To address the medical need, Venatorx has identified a novel series of highly
selective cyclic boronates that bind to and disrupt penicillin-binding protein (PBP) transpeptidase (TPase)
function while avoiding the action of all current and future β-lactamases. This approach creates the first prospect
and “rare” new class gram negative agent to treat infections caused by any β-lactamase-producing CRE
pathogen. Significant strides in microbiological activity have already been achieved within the series by the lead
compound VNRX-6736, with an MIC90 of 32 µg/mL relative to 128 µg/mL for meropenem-vaborbactam and
≥1,024 µg/mL for ceftazidime-avibactam in a recent challenge set of 100 CRE isolates. Not only does VNRX-
6736 outperform these clinical comparators from an MIC90 perspective, but does so with a narrow range of MIC
owing to β-lactamase avoidance, a feature that will ultimately benefit setting of breakpoints. The series is rapidly
bactericidal, exhibits a low spontaneous mutational frequency (frequency of resistance at 4x MIC of <2.7 x 10-11
in E. coli ATCC 25922) and has favorable ADME and PK properties. Proof of concept efficacy has been achieved
by VNRX-6736 in the murine thigh model of carbapenem-resistant E. coli infection and pharmacokinetics
modeling suggests that 30-45% time above MIC is required to achieve efficacy. Optimization efforts proposed
herein are targeting an 8-fold improvement in antibacterial activity driven by rational structure-guided design to
improve PBP binding interaction kinetics to enable an MIC90 ≤ 4 µg/mL. Such an optimized cyclic boronate PBPi
could be a 1st new class antibiotic addressing resistance to β-lactams for the treatment of infections caused by
CRE and a long term therapeutic solution to resistance development in Enterobacterales."

This is an application to renew the Infectious Diseases/Basic Microbial Pathogenesis Training Grant from
Washington University. With the advent of generally available antibiotic therapy about 50 years ago, many
physicians and scientists predicted the end of infectious diseases as a major area of health concern.
Subsequent events have proven this prediction wrong, and the past decades have seen the emergence of
many newly identified infectious diseases, including Lyme Disease, erlichiosis, SARS, COVID-19, West Nile
encephalitis, chikungunya, MERS, ebola and HIV. The reemergence of old infectious diseases, such as
malaria and tuberculosis, in more virulent and more antibiotic resistant forms also has increased public
attention on the health problems posed by infectious diseases. It is rare that a week goes by without some
troubling headline concerning new infectious disease outbreaks. Thus, far from gradual disappearance as a
health concern, infectious diseases have emerged as being of increasing importance to the health concerns
of the nation. The emerging antibiotic resistance of current pathogens and the rise of new disease agents
have made clear the necessity of increased fundamental scientific investigation into all aspects of infectious
diseases. The purpose of the Washington University Training Program in Infectious Diseases/Basic Microbial
Pathogenesis is to help fulfill this need by recruiting promising young investigators to this field and training
them in outstanding research programs with preeminent investigators who collaborate across multiple
disciplines (or who function in interdisciplinary teams) to perform infectious disease research. Our Training
Program, which has had NIH support for the past 40 years, integrates faculty from four departments:
Medicine, Pediatrics, Molecular Microbiology and Pathology & Immunology. The program provides training to
M.D., Ph.D., and M.D./Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows, and to Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. students, in disciplines
related to pathogenesis and host defense in Infectious Diseases. The laboratories of the program preceptors
use tools of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, genomics, immunology, cell biology and translational
medicine. Thus, the program trains young investigators to be able to answer the important questions of
microbial pathogenesis, from studies of basic biology through application to the bedside."
10823308,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term objectives of this application are to understand how epigenetic factors control the invasive growth
and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and to develop novel therapeutics for
HNSCC. Patients with HNSCC, particularly human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC, exhibit poor overall
5-year survival rates compared to breast and colorectal cancers. Therefore, novel effective therapies need to be
developed for HNSCC patients. Emerging evidence suggests that histone methylation plays a critical role in
activation of gene transcription in HNSCC by regulating chromatin accessibility. We have identified that the
histone demethylase KDM4A as a key epigenetic factor, stimulated the transcription of the invasive genes to
promote HNSCC invasion and metastasis by erasing repressive H3K9me3 marks. To further confirm that
KDM4A is an important target for HNSCC treatment, we took advantage of the 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-
induced mouse model of HNSCC, which fully simulates HNSCC development and lymph node metastasis in a
syngeneic tumor immune microenvironment. We found that the specific deletion of KDM4A significantly inhibited
HNSCC invasive growth and lymph node metastasis. Our RNA-seq analysis found that KDM4A ablation
significantly suppressed the gene expression associated with cell migration and epithelial mesenchymal
transition in primary HNSCC, which confirmed our previous findings. Unexpectedly, a set of genes associated
with immune response was robustly upregulated in primary HNSCC tissues from KDM4A knockout mice.
Immunostaining revealed that the inhibition of KDM4A increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in HNSCC.
Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD1/PD-L1 have achieved great success in several solid
tumors including HNSCC. Although anti-PD1 therapy has been approved for treating recurrent or metastatic
HNSCC, the objective response rate is less than 20%, indicating that HNSCC cells might be intrinsically resistant
to checkpoint blockades. Thus, reversing the hypo-immunogenicity of HNSCC cells has become increasingly
imperative to ongoing cancer immunotherapy. Given the critical role of KDM4A in chromatin accessibility and
DNA replication, we hypothesize that targeting KDM4A not only inhibits the expression of invasive genes, but
also potently activate tumor-intrinsic immunity and induce CD8+ T cell infiltration by inducing DNA replication
stress. To test our hypothesis, we will propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine whether KDM4A ablation
inhibits the expression of invasive genes and activates tumor cell-intrinsic immunity in HNSCC; 2) Explore
targeting KDM4A impairs DNA replication and activates tumor cell-intrinsic immune responses by inducing
replication stress; and 3) Determine whether targeting KDM4A can help to overcome HNSCC resistance to PD-
1 blockade therapy by recruiting and activating CD8+ T cells. The results from our studies might help us to
develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating head and neck cancer."
