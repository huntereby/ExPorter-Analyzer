Deciphering how axons terminate growth and forms synapses is essential if we are to understand how a nervous
system is built. Such knowledge could provide opportunities to treat neurodevelopmental disorders and will be
needed if we are to harness the robust and resilient nature of the developing nervous system to design novel
therapies for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our long-term goal is to
understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern axon termination and synapse formation
in vivo using the nematode C. elegans.
 The Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) proteins are ubiquitin ligases and signaling hubs that are important
conserved regulators of axon termination, synapse formation and axon degeneration. Emerging links between
PHR signaling and neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (including AD) have further
heightened interest in understanding PHR signaling networks. Here, we use the latest high-sensitivity mass
spectrometry technology; rapid automated protein extraction and purification; and novel ubiquitination ‘traps’ to
decipher the signaling network of the C. elegans PHR protein, RPM-1. This has revealed two putative RPM-1
ubiquitination substrates and provided numerous footholds for deciphering how RPM-1 is regulated.
 Our first aim focuses on an autophagy initiating kinase as a novel RPM-1 ubiquitination substrate.
CRISPR/Cas9 editing and genetics test if RPM-1 ubiquitin ligase activity affects the stability and turnover of this
kinase to influence axon and synapse development. We also evaluate how RPM-1 effects on this kinase affect
autophagosome formation in neurons. Outcomes will provide insight into whether PHR proteins regulate
autophagy, and address how autophagy is inhibited in the nervous system in vivo. Our interest in these questions
is further fueled by the prominent role autophagy plays in neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.
 Our second aim will evaluate another novel RPM-1 ubiquitination substrate, a kinase with prominent roles
in synapse development, synaptic plasticity and AD. We will determine how RPM-1 inhibits this kinase, and
whether this affects axon termination and synapse formation. We also aim to address which downstream
mechanisms this kinase utilizes to affect axon and synapse development. Despite the importance of this kinase
in nervous system health and disease, how it is inhibited remains unknown in any organism.
 Finally, proteomics provided several entry points into understanding how RPM-1 might be regulated. In our
third aim, we focus on three particularly compelling entry points. 1) The most prominent RPM-1 binding protein
identified. 2) Components of an entire receptor signaling system identified as RPM-1 binding proteins. 3)
Numerous residues in RPM-1 that are phosphorylated in vivo. We will evaluate how these mechanisms affect
RPM-1 localization, and RPM-1 functions in axon and synapse development. Our interest in these questions is
driven by a simple theme: How PHR proteins are regulated, in any system, remains dark biology."

The New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (NM ADRC) is strategically and geographically
positioned in an area of the country with an extremely diverse and underserved population that has limited access
to health and dementia care. With funding from the NIH for the prior P20 exploratory ADRC, we established an
infrastructure and formed partnerships to improve dementia care in rural communities of New Mexico and
provided them an opportunity to be part of the national network of ADRC centers formed to meet the crisis in
AD/ADRD. The NM ADRC is built on years of experience of research on biomarkers to identify vascular
contributions to Alzheimer’s and inflammation. We have studied the impact of inflammation and blood-brain
barrier (BBB) disruption as key mechanisms of disease. We have a strong track record of multi-consortium
studies through RO1 and MarkVCID grants. This proposal for a NM ADRC is to establish a fully integrated ADRC
in New Mexico, a frontier state with a high proportion of minorities without access to dementia diagnosis and
treatment. We plan to collaborate with other ADRCs and identify novel risk factors driving dementia in
underserved Hispanic/Latino (H/L) and American Indian (AI) communities. We will work on-site in the remote
areas, such as Zuni and Acoma Pueblos, with the use of a mobile MRI scanner and community health
representatives. The large Hispanic/Latino populations in the state will be engaged in the Outreach, Recruitment,
and Engagement (ORE) Core. The UNM Center for Memory and Aging uses Biomarkers to change the way we
diagnosis, classify and treat adults with cognitive impairment. The Biomarker fluid core can test for biomarkers
in plasma that will make large scale screening to identify patients at risk for AD/ADRD in the rural population.
The Neuroimaging Core can determine the presence of vascular disease by diffusion tensor imaging of white
matter, and the Biomarker Core can measure proteins associated with inflammation and neurodegeneration in
the blood, improving patient classification. Scientifically, the NM ADRC will be at the cutting-edge in developing
novel neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers that help distinguish different types of dementia at an early stage
and accurately classify them for future clinical trials. New cores and components in the NM ADRC for
Neuropathology, Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement, and Research Education will provide New Mexico
with expanded resources for dementia care, training, and research that will benefit AD researchers in the state.
We plan to accomplish this under four specific overall aims: Specific Aim 1: Recruit and retain a large cohort of
older individuals with cognitive disabilities, particularly those in the medically underserved minority communities.
Specific Aim 2: Improve classification of the heterogeneous dementia patient population with plasma-based
biomarkers that have been developed as part of the NMeADRC and MarkVCID consortium. Specific Aim 3:
Study the role of vascular disease and inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD and multi etiology dementia.
Specific Aim 4: Train the next generation of healthcare workers from diverse H/L and AI communities."
10868309,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)
The Administrative Core (AC) of the New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (NM ADRC) coordinates
all activities and ensures the cohesiveness of the 7 cores and one component. Individuals in the AC have been
working together in the exploratory NMeADRC. The AC formed critical partnerships to improve dementia
diagnosis and care in the urban and rural Hispanic/Latino (H/L) and American Indian (AI) communities. Zuni
Pueblo is an example of a rural medically underrepresented population a long distance from a major medical
center. We overcame the barriers of distance by using a mobile scanner to perform on-site MRI studies and with
Community Health Representative doing neuropsychological testing. We formed a partnership with the New
Mexico state Aging and Long-Term Services Department to expand dementia care by training community based
social workers with ECHO telehealth resources. Those identified as at risk for AD will undergo further studies at
the UNM Center for Memory and Aging (CMA). The AC will establish committees and hold regular meetings of
the Executive Committee composed of the Core leaders to address problems. We will continue to send
demographic, clinical, biomarker and imaging data to the national repositories. Training the next generation of
AD scientists will be done with developmental grants that will be awarded to two early-stage investigators. The
AC formed partnerships with other research centers in the university and around the state to promote AD/ADRD
research. The AC organized a highly successful research symposium that highlighted research at NM ADRC
and other sites. The AC was important in developing the framework for the P30 grant and identifying strong core
leaders from other departments in the university. The day-to-day operation of the NM ADRC will be done by the
AC in consultation with the core leaders. The University is committed to inclusiveness and diversity, and we will
conform to that model to aid the unique minoritized populations in the state. New Mexico is a “frontier” state with
a large land mass and a sparse, scattered population. The UNM CMA is the only center for dementia care in the
Rocky Mountain region and the NM ADRC will be the first such center in an area extending from Mexico to
Canada. It will bring advanced dementia research, such as plasma-based biomarkers and advanced MR imaging
to rural areas to identify individuals at risk for AD who could benefit from the emerging treatments for dementia.
The AC will oversee research in the NM ADRC on the role of inflammation and patient classification methods
based on machine learning, starting to bring concepts of precision medicine to rural communities."
10868310,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL CORE (CC)
Consistent with the overall theme of the New Mexico Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the Clinical Core
will develop a longitudinal cohort that will support research addressing key gaps in the literature, such as 1)
common and unique early disease mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment
dementia (VCID); 2) the development and validation of fluid- and imaging- based biomarkers in diverse cohorts;
and 3) evaluating factors that contribute to dementia disparities in American Indian (AI) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L)
groups. To address these gaps, the NM ADRC Clinical Core will work closely with the other cores to recruit and
retain a diverse, community-based cohort of individuals with AD and VCID spectrum and healthy controls (Aim
1). As a young center, we will focus on recruiting preclinical subjects with biomarker evidence of AD and/or a
high risk of VCID to be followed over time. We will strategically oversample AI and H/Ls to obtain equal
representation of these groups (1/3 AI; 1/3 H/L; and 1/3 non-Hispanic white) to support collaborative research
efforts to develop and validate imaging and fluid biomarkers and evaluate the role of early inflammation and
neurovascular unit dysfunction (Aim 2). We will expand our assessment procedures to include evaluation of
sociocultural factors that may impact performance on neuropsychological assessments (e.g. bilingualism, quality
of education, and factors that affect risk and resilience in AI and H/L communities (e.g. healthcare literacy,
access; Aim 3). We will modify our return of results procedures to first incorporate systematic assessment of
interest in feedback and effectiveness. This framework will support the development and testing of socioculturally
tailored feedback procedures to ensure effective communication of results to foster long-term brain health across
the literacy spectrum (Aim 4). Finally, we will support the training of the next generation of diverse ADRD
researchers in collaboration with the Research Education Component (Aim 5). Consistent with the National Plan
to Address Alzheimer’s disease and corresponding NIA/NINDS’ Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias 2022
Summit, the Clinical Core will advance equity in AD/ADRD research through increasing representation of diverse
populations in projects that aim to develop and validate biomarkers in these populations. Our integration with the
Imaging and Biomarker Cores will support multi-modal imaging, biospecimens, and clinical markers to evaluate
early disease mechanisms and their contributions to the clinical heterogeneity seen in diverse groups. Finally, in
collaboration with the REC, we will provide training and support to groups of persons historically
underrepresented in biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. Ultimately, this work will reduce inequities and
foster resilience of the region’s diverse communities by promoting healthy aging and reducing risk factors for
AD/ADRD."
10868557,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common autoimmune joint disease with over 15 treatment options,
reflecting both advances in therapy as well as the heterogenous response to therapy. After the first line
therapy methotrexate (MTX), patients and their rheumatologist proceed on a trial-and-error approach to identify
the optimal treatment. A landmark randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT), RACAT, compared the
effectiveness of triple therapy-MTX, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine vs MTX and a tumor necrosis factor
inhibitor (TNFi). The RACAT subgroup analyses observed that some patients had a better response to one
treatment strategy vs the other. However, like most RCTs, it was underpowered to better characterize these
subgroups. Real-world data (RWD), such as electronic health record (EHR) and registry data, have a larger
sample size but lack the randomization and precise clinical measurements performed as part of clinical trials.
The objective of this proposal is to apply and rigorously test state-of-the-art methods that can combine the
strengths of RCT and RWD to extend RCT findings. RACAT was a Veterans Affairs (VA) based clinical trial
and thus many of their subjects also have EHR data in parallel, providing an ideal study design to test methods
to understand how well we can replicated RCT using RWD. In Aim 1, we test methods using semi-supervised
machine learning methods to impute RACAT clinical endpoints using EHR data; the linked RACAT data will be
used as the gold standard comparison. Next, we apply causal inference modeling comparing triple therapy vs
TNFi using EHR data with the imputed endpoints and validate results using the linked RACAT data. In Aim 2,
we apply novel causal modeling methods that enable us to examine subgroup findings using RWD. We will
identify subjects in the larger EHR and registries similar to RACAT subgroups, i.e. patients who benefitted
more from triple therapy vs TNFi or vice versa, and subjects who remained on TNFi throughout the trial and did
well. These larger populations will provide improved power to study potential predictors of treatment response.
Moreover, the integration of EHR data allows us to study a broader set of potential predictors not collected in
RCT or registry data. Our overarching hypothesis is that we will identify the clinical subgroups observed in
RACAT with differing response to treatments within the larger populations of RA patients in EHR and registry.
We will also identify novel predictors of response by using a broader set of clinical data available in EHR. This
study is significant because it will provide a blueprint for studies for extending RCT findings in datasets with
linked RCT and RWD, applicable to many treatments and conditions. This study is innovative because of its
approach to maximize the data available from RCTs with existing RWD using linked datasets, powering studies
to optimize RA therapy for different patients. This proposal also anticipates the growing ability of patients and
institutions to access EHR data, enabling previously siloed datasets to become part of data-driven studies to
advance clinical management of RA and other conditions."
10868659,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although differences in auditory encoding and resting-state (RS) neural activity are often reported in
children with typical development (TD) versus autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the pattern of findings
across studies is inconsistent. The PI has sought to understand the above via studying the maturation of
these processes, this work supported by his current R01 (locally referred to as the ‘Brains Change’
study). A consistent finding has been a pattern of brain development that indicates overly rapid followed
by too slow brain maturation in ASD. The continuation R01 will demonstrate that this pattern of brain
maturation in ASD continues through at least early adolescence as a basis for developing
disease-stage-specific assessment and treatment methods. In addition to continuing to map the
maturation of RS neural activity, two auditory cortex neural processes that emerge during late childhood
are targeted. First is the auditory M100 response, with findings from the current R01 already suggesting
that M100, reflecting higher-order auditory encoding, emerges too early in ASD. Second, a new 40 Hz
auditory steady-state response exam will assess the emergence and development of cortical inhibitory
interneuron and pyramidal cell excitation and inhibition processes. Maturation findings, expected to
demonstrate early accelerated then later flat development in ASD, will show a process that repeats
itself across childhood and thus leads to a patterned derailment of emerging neural processes in
ASD that extends far beyond infancy and early childhood. Tied to the above are two additional goals.
First, given group differences in brain maturation rates, studies that average findings across a large age
range will miss effects, and cross-sectional comparisons will be complicated. The PI’s research identifies
age-specific brain markers in order to provide a basis for developing disease-stage-specific assessment
and treatment targets. Second, and building upon the PIs adult studies, analysis of simultaneously
collected MEG and EEG is expected to demonstrate the advantage of obtaining regionally specific
measures when assessing group differences as well as enable identification of EEG-only assessment
methods that are routinely feasible in the clinic. Our intention is that Brains Change findings will
change the way ASD research is conducted via demonstrations that the pattern of group
differences changes across time (even across a 3-year period), and via identifying very specific
brain abnormalities in ASD with respect to age, brain location, and brain process. The current
project assesses brain function, structure, and clinical measures in children 6 to 8 years old, and then 18
and 36 months later. For the renewal R01, each child will be followed another 3 years (3 brain imaging
exams with 18 months between exams). Allowing attrition of the current sample across time, the Time 3
sample (N = 35/group) will be increased by 65+/group to start the continuation with 100 ASD and 100 TD."

The viruses that infect bacteria, called bacteriophages (phages), are robust killers. In response to the frequent
threat of phage infection, bacteria have developed a suite of anti-phage immune mechanisms, such as
restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas enzymes. Phages have emerged as promising alternatives to
antibiotics in our current “superbug” crisis, but immune systems are a barrier for successful phage replication.
Broad-spectrum phages that evade immune detection and kill multiple isolates of antibiotic-resistant pathogens
may prove essential in this fight. We screened 12 obligately lytic phages infecting the prominent antibiotic-
resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to identify phages with the ability to broadly evade DNA-targeting
immune systems CRISPR-Cas and restriction enzymes. Jumbophage ΦKZ evaded all six DNA-targeting
systems tested, making it the strongest “anti-immune” phage identified to date. The mechanisms behind pan-
immune evasion for this phage family will be investigated here, with the goal of making fundamental discoveries
at the phage host-interface that could benefit phage therapies and other biotechnologies in the future.
 ΦKZ is a jumbophage with a 280 kb genome, has many relatives that infect other Gram negative
pathogens, and is outstanding in its ability to evade bacterial nucleolytic immune systems. Immune evasion is
enabled by the assembly of a phage-encoded proteinaceous nucleus-like shell (“phage nucleus”) that serves as
a replicative compartment. However, it is unknown how this phage protects its genome prior to the phage nucleus
being assembled and subsequently, how protein inclusion/exclusion is regulated. We have identified phage
proteins that are ejected with the genome and hypothesize that an “injected structure” (IS) creates a DNA-
containing organelle that occludes immune nucleases. Understanding how ejected proteins can rapidly shield
DNA from numerous host nucleases, and how the host fights back against the IS with novel immune
systems likely represents fundamentally new phage-host interaction paradigms. Next, the nascent phage
nucleus assembles adjacent to the IS and receives the phage genome. Subsequently, the phage nucleus imports
proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription, while excluding immune nucleases, through unknown
mechanisms. A genetic screen in our lab has identified the first phage mutants defective in protein import,
with mutations in a single gene. Structure predictions suggest that the encoded protein may be homologous to
the conserved TRPV family of ion channels. We will determine its subcellular localization, interaction partners
and in vitro properties with the goal of elucidating how a “nuclear pore” could work in a phage. In sum, our work
here will unveil new phage biology driven by the co-evolution of host and virus, leading to innovative and
potentially transferrable mechanisms for enhancing phage success in the fight against deadly pathogens."

The field of cancer research and treatment has greatly advanced due to breakthroughs in DNA sequencing
techniques. These developments have accelerated the identification of dependency genes and paved the way
for precision medicine. Many encoded dependency proteins, however, are not known to bind endogenous small
molecules and are consequently more difficult to gauge in terms of their potential for targeting by chemical probes.
""Binding-first"" platforms including Activity-Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) technology have revealed numerous
cysteine sites amenable to small-molecule binding. However, it is unclear whether these ligandable sites are
important for protein functions and could serve as starting points for small molecule drug development. To
address this challenge, I have recently innovated a base editing - ABPP platform that assesses the essentiality
of ligandable cysteines in cancer dependency proteins. Notably, I have uncovered several highly ligandable and
functionally important sites in dependency proteins, including TOE1. In this proposal, I will utilize biochemistry,
sequencing and chemical proteomic methods to 1) dissect the mechanisms of how covalent probes affect TOE1
activity and remodel RNA interactions and 2) explore the consequences of TOE1 inhibition and determinants of
sensitivity in cancer. I will also describe plans for continued technology innovation to 3) identify novel functional
cysteines in cancer dependency proteins using prime editing. In the long-term, I aspire to create first-in-class
therapeutics targeting ligandable cysteines in Strongly Selective cancer dependencies.
During the award period, I will improve my communication, writing and scientific skills and learn new lab
techniques including eCLIP sequencing and prime editing. The proposed studies will be performed at the Scripps
Research Institute (TSRI), a top-ranking institution renowned for its integration of state-of-the-art chemistry and
biomedicine research. My mentor, Dr. Benjamin Cravatt, a leading figure in chemical biology and chemical
proteomics, and co-mentors Dr. Gene Yeo, a pioneer in RNA-binding protein research, and Dr. David Liu, a
leader in the field of genome editing, will provide me invaluable guidance. I will also collaborate with molecular
biologist Dr. Lykke-Andersen and medical oncologist Dr. Park at UCSD. Collectively, this research and
professional development plan will offer me crucial training during this transitional phase and support me in
launching my own laboratory in a research university."
10868502,"ABSTRACT: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal degeneration caused by one or more of a large
number of genetic mutations. It is a major cause of blindness and severe vision loss in people aged 20-60
years. The first symptom in RP is loss of night vision as a result of mutation-caused death of rod
photoreceptors. Subsequent loss of cone photoreceptors leads to gradual constriction of visual field and
eventually blindness. Currently, there is no treatment for preventing vision loss in RP. NAC Attack is a phase-3
multicenter, randomized, double masked, parallel and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients with RP. Participants will be randomized to receive either
oral NAC of 1800mg/bid or placebo in a ratio of 2:1 and will be followed for 45-months.
 The Coordinating Center (CC) collaborates closely with the Executive Committee to ensure the success
of NAC Attack. The CC contributes to study leadership and provides expertise on trial design, facilitation of
recruitment and retention of participants, coordination across all trial entities, implementation and maintenance
of a high-quality data management system, statistical analysis, and quality assurance. The CC will:
 Enlist and retain Clinical Sites with experienced investigators and sufficient recruitment capacity;
 Ensure that Clinical Site personnel complete certification requirements and are in regulatory compliance;
 Create and maintain the study database through design and implementation of data collection forms, secure
 web-based data capture using REDCap, data editing, and data management;
 Create and maintain the study cloud-based portal using JHU OneDrive to receive and manage imaging and
 test files from the clinical sites;
 Advise Clinical Sites on resolution of real-time problems and overall strategies for successful implementation
 of the study protocol;
 Provide aids to clinical sites for study management such as appointment schedule, reminders of upcoming
 visits, missing forms, and incomplete submission of study materials;
 Provide regular reports on study progress & performance to Clinical Sites and all study committees;
 Design and implement a full program of quality assurance activities including certification of personnel and
 clinical sites, site visits, and performance monitoring;
 Provide interim and final statistical analyses of study data;
 Prepare for various committee and study meetings;
 Participate and lead in the preparation of scientific presentations and reports.
NAC Attack has the potential to identify a pharmacological therapy benefitting all patients with RP, irrespective
of the identification of their causative mutation, and thus to impact on the clinical management of RP."

X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for determining the atomic positions of proteins, used by researchers at
synchrotrons and X-ray free electron lasers. Typically, the crystal is exposed to X-rays, which diffract and are
collected on a detector to create diffraction patterns. These patterns are processed by software designed to
seek out weak signal on the images and create datasets from which the protein structure can be solved.
 The DIALS diffraction data processing package is a mature product produced in collaboration between
LBNL and Diamond Light Source (UK) that has primarily been supported in the US by research funding. DIALS
is used at a number of synchrotrons world-wide for regular processing of user datasets and has been used at X-
ray free electron lasers for fast processing of large datasets collected at hundreds to thousands of images per
second. The program allows fast feedback of data quality when incorporated into automated processing that
allows users to quickly make decisions about beamline operation and experimental direction. This has allowed
researchers to produce high-impact structures in general biological fields, including human diseases such as
COVID-19 and malaria, and energy research such as photosynthesis.
 This proposal would create a US R24 National Resource for the DIALS diffraction data processing
package. The Resource would move DIALS funding in the US from primarily R01 research funding to a
combination of separate research funding and operational funding from this proposal. The operational funding
would be to support codebase optimization, maintenance, and refactoring, a build-and-release schedule, and
new robust and adaptable user interfaces. Further, it would provide user outreach and training, both for general
users, and through on-site training for beamline scientists to help with software integration into existing pipelines.
 The end result will be a well-maintained and documented software package used at synchrotrons and
XFELs for routine data analysis without user intervention, and robust support for difficult cases."
10867954,"Exposure to media depicting gun violence against young people, including mass shootings and police-involved shootings of Black people, has been linked to decreased perceptions of personal safety and increased anxiety and depression symptoms among adolescents. Black adolescents may also experience profound racial stress and trauma following vicarious exposures to police-involved shootings. Yet, exceedingly little research has examined how the adolescent brain is impacted by almost daily access to gun violence broadcasts during this period of high neural plasticity and whether these exposures lead to experience-dependent alterations in neurocognitive markers of vigilance, as well as increases in media consumption and anxiety/depression symptoms. We hypothesize that neurodevelopmental shifts in the resolution of competition between stimulus-driven vs. goal-directed attention primes the development of vigilance for media coverage of gun violence. This, in turn, perpetuates a distressing cycle where hypervigilant teens consume more media about gun violence events, often at the expense of engaging in competing mood-boosting activities. And by virtue of self-identifying with Black victims of police-involved shootings, Black adolescents may be at even greater risk through these pathways. To assess the resolution of competing visuocortical components of vigilance, we will utilize steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), derived from EEG, as a brain-based assessment that will enhance precision and reliability compared to conventional behavioral or neural measures. A novel SSVEP paradigm, co-designed with a teen community advisory board to ensure cultural relevance, will evaluate goal-directed attention in the presence of stimulus-driven threat stimuli selected from past media broadcasts. The study will enroll a community sample of 250 adolescents (ages 13-17 at baseline; 50% identifying as Black; 50% assigned female at birth) and follow them every six months for eighteen months during this critical period of risk for vigilance and the development of depression and anxiety. Vigilance (indexed by SSVEPs), media consumption of gun violence events, and symptoms of anxiety and depression will be assessed at each study visit, and daily diary assessments will be conducted in the 7 days preceding each SSVEP assessment, as well as in the 7 days following significant national or local gun violence events. A primary aim is to evaluate the impact of vigilance and media consumption on prospective changes in adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms. We will also investigate potential racial inequities, with a focus on racial identity as a moderator of the association between vigilance and media consumption of police-involved shootings and subsequent anxiety and depression. Analyses will also examine directional effects between vigilance and media consumption to determine if a feedback loop may perpetuate these biases over time. This study will provide novel, integrative insights into the neurocognitive sequalae of media exposure to gun violence events. Findings will inform brain-based interventions to reduce anxiety and depression in adolescents, particularly for Black adolescents experiencing racial stress and trauma."
10881637,"The PI is an expert in extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor biology and how these receptors control ECM
homeostasis in health and disease. As progressive accumulation of ECM leads to fibrosis, the PI goal is to
determine the mechanisms whereby ECM receptors control matrix synthesis/degradation in order to devise more
effective anti-fibrotic therapies. Among the matrix receptors the PI focuses on integrins (VA Merit Review) and
discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) (NIH/NIDDK R01) in the regulation of collagen synthesis and degradation in
kidney injury.
The PI’s group has evidence that the collagen receptor integrin α1β1 is a negative regulator of fibrosis and it
plays a protective role by: 1) downregulating the activation of the TGF-β receptor in a ligand independent manner
and dampening Smad-dependent pro-fibrotic signaling; 2) inhibiting the activation of the EGF receptor; 3)
negatively regulating the assembly of the NADPH oxidase thus reducing oxidative stress; and 4) preventing the
phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the ribonucleoprotein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) (VA Merit Review).
In contrast to integrin α1β1, integrin α2β1 and DDR1 are postive regulators of fibrosis and studies from the PI
group indicate that genetic deletion of integrin α2β1 or DDR1 protects mice from the development of kidney
fibrosis after injury. The PI’s group provides strong evidence that the deleterious action of these two matrix
receptors resides in their ability to activate pro-inflammatory (MCP-1) and pro-fibrotic (Stat-3) downstream
signaling. In addition, the PI provides the novel finding that DDR1 can regulate collagen production by
translocating to the nucleus where it localizes to chromatin to promote the transcription of collagen.
Based on these findings, the PI’s goal is to devise peptide-based inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors to target
these receptors and/or their downstream signaling. The PI’s group has strong evidence that small-molecule and
peptide-based approaches to inhibit integrin α2β1 and FUS nuclear translocation, respectively, have a great
promise to be used as anti-fibrotic approaches in vitro and in animal models. Based on these exciting results
the PI is currently refining strategies to prevent and ideally halt kidney fibrosis and identifying novel and
potentially targetable molecules selectively regulated by integrins and DDRs.
The PI studies are published in high rated journals including Journal of American Society of Nephrology, Kidney
International, Matrix Biology, Journal of Clinical Investigation, to name a few. In order to be successful, the PI
has assembled a team of cell biologists, medicinal chemists, experts in the generation of cell-penetrating peptide-
mediated therapeutic molecule, and nephrologists both at the University and VA site. The PI’s area of research
is highly relevant to our Veterans because kidney fibrosis and consequent end stage kidney disease are
commons in active duty military and Veterans. The work performed by the PI and her team will lead to the
development of novel strategies to halt and ideally prevent kidney fibrosis and, hence, improve the quality of
lives of our Veterans."
10881641,"The morbidity and mortality associated with obesity is a major health problem in the VA patient
population. There is abundant evidence that obesity confers increased risk for various forms of cancer. The
VA reports ~40,000 new cases of cancer per year and ~2.7-3% are liver cancer. Obesity is associated with
metabolic disturbances such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form non-
alcoholic steatosis (NASH) and these are risk factors for both cirrhosis and liver cancer. So chronic liver
disease, whether induced by viral infection, alcohol use, obesity or any combination thereof, is the major risk
factor for cirrhosis and ultimately liver cancer. The Veteran population is at high risk for obesity-associated liver
disease and hence liver cancer so it is important to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease.
Similarly the incidence of breast cancer is increased in obese populations, and the epidemiologic evidence for
the obesity-breast cancer connection is particularly strong in post-menopausal women. One in eight women
will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime. As increasing numbers of women enter military
service, women’s health issues become a greater concern for the VA. Battlefield exposures to toxicants and
bad nutrition may trigger the metabolic syndrome that is associated with higher risk of heart disease, diabetes
and cancer. Studies to understand how environmental and nutritional events impact the regulation of normal
metabolism will shed greater light on how metabolic dysregulation increases the risk of various diseases.
 We have found that reducing inflammation and insulin resistance reduces breast cancer growth in mice.
This can be done by providing high levels of omega3 fatty acids or through a nutritional intervention involving
time-restricted feeding of a high-fat diet. Due to the link between obesity, insulin resistance and breast cancer
risk in post-menopausal women, and the potential that a similar time-restricted, dietary intervention could
protect against breast cancer in humans, it is important to understand how correcting insulin resistance
reduces the risk of breast cancer growth in mice and investigate the physiological changes that may drive
tumor growth in obesity.
 We have published that loss of a particular RNA splicing factor SRSF3 in hepatocytes causes chronic
liver damage, disruptions in glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and eventually liver cancer.
So the loss of the splicing factor does not cause tumors but rather creates a pre-disposition to cancer, similar
to a tumor suppressor gene. We have since shown that loss of SRSF3 is found in early liver disease in both
humans and mice, in addition to being lost in liver cancer, so loss of SRSF3 may be the precipitating event that
triggers progressive liver disease. Our studies will address key questions concerning the fundamental
biological process of protein homeostasis and carcinogenesis in the liver and will integrate biochemical, cell
and molecular biological experiments with physiological studies in mice lacking specific splicing factors in liver.
We will investigate whether preventing degradation of SRSF3 in mice is sufficient to prevent the progression of
early liver disease to inflammation, fibrosis and cirrhosis, and we will determine whether this approach
prevents liver cancer or can be used to reverse liver cancer in mice.
 Lastly, obesity is associated with tissue inflammation and we have shown that altering cAMP levels in
dendritic cells changes their ability to instruct T cells to develop into Th2 or Th17 lineages. This has important

furthermore found that induction of a Th17 biased inflammation accelerates lung cancer in mice, and loss of IL-
17A prevents tumor growth. Our studies are designed to understand the link between inflammation and
metabolism, and how these alter lung cancer growth. This is an important area of research for the VA patient
population as smoking is common among veterans."

Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic, disabling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with enormous
social and economic impact, decreased quality of life, increased mortality, and rising global incidence. Despite
the approval of a number of biologic and small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of CD, the therapeutic
ceiling for CD appears to have plateaued. Therefore, there is an unmet need to explore prevention strategies in
CD. Dietary and lifestyle factors are thought to be primary CD risk factors, and may exert influence on CD
development in the pre-clinical disease phase via pathways that mediate intestinal permeability and abnormal
immune responses. CD-specific biomarkers, which emerge in the pre-clinical phase, predict subclinical
inflammation, correlate with disease activity, and may decrease with dietary changes. Thus, dietary and
lifestyle modification may normalize CD biomarkers and reduce disease risk. High-risk individuals for CD, such
as first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with IBD or those who carry genetic variants associated with CD,
may be an attractive group for disease prevention strategies. Our overarching hypothesis is that lifestyle
modification in individuals at high-risk for CD reduces risk of CD development, and that personalized risk
disclosure and risk factor counseling can be feasibly delivered to FDRs via the personalized risk estimation for
CD (PRE-CD) tool. To test this hypothesis, we will assess how adherence to a healthy diet and lifestyle
impacts risk for CD in FDRs (Aim 1) and those with elevated polygenic risk scores for CD (Aim 2) from the
Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHSII, Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Growing Up Today Study using
a target-trial methodology to emulate a randomized controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle intervention. Second,
we will develop and test the feasibility (Aim 3a) and explore the efficacy of the PRE-CD tool on behaviors (Aim
3b) and pre-clinical biomarkers (Aim 3c) associated with CD in FDR recruited from the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) Crohn’s and Colitis Center. This work will provide valuable insight into the role of lifestyle and
dietary modification in CD development and prevention strategies in high-risk individuals, addressing a critical
gap in the field of IBD prevention. Further, through the proposed work, as well as a formal didactic curriculum,
the candidate will gain additional training in the fields of nutritional epidemiology, causal inference, and
conducting clinical trials. This career development plan will enable the candidate to achieve her long-term
goals of becoming an independently funded clinical-investigator and generate preliminary data to subsequently
apply for an NIH R01 award. The candidate will conduct her work in the supportive, robust research
environment of the MGH Division of Gastroenterology, MGH Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit, and
Harvard School of Public Health supervised by a dedicated and distinguished mentorship team and research
advisory committee."

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular housekeeping system that mediates the removal of damaged
or excess organelles and harmful protein aggregates. Selective autophagy targets specific substrates and is
mediated mainly by autophagy receptors, which contain an LC3-interacting region and can therefore bind directly
to the mammalian ATG8 (ATG8) family of proteins, including MAP1LC3A (LC3A), LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP,
GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2. Viral xenophagy (virophagy) is a form of selective autophagy targeting finally
assembled virions or components thereof and is believed to be the first line of host defense against virus infection.
While several different mechanisms of virophagy to some viruses have recently been proposed, it is largely
unknown how antiviral selective autophagy is activated by infection by human gammaherpesviruses, including
human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HHV-8 is the
etiological agent of at least three human malignancies, Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL),
and multicentric Castleman’s disease in immunodeficient individuals with HIV-1 infection or those taking
immunosuppressant drugs. Two infection stages of HHV-8 in the host, latency and lytic replication, are causally
associated with HHV-8 pathogenesis. To comprehensively assess the functional involvement of selective
autophagy in HHV-8 infection, we generated the cell lines of BCBL-1, an HHV-8-infected PEL cell, that are
knocked out for each gene of ATG8 proteins. While any of the single gene knockout (KO) of the ATG8 family did
not affect the growth of latently infected cells, a loss of LC3B, but not the other members, promoted productive
virus replication, potentially through selective upregulation of the late lytic gene expression and suppression of
type III interferon (IFN) expression. In addition, we found that intracellular viral DNA (vDNA) content and nuclear
size significantly increased in lytic LC3B KO cells. LC3B overexpression significantly reduced the nuclear size
of lytic cells, but this effect was reversed by autophagy inhibition. Moreover, the formation of nuclear blebs,
indicative of nucleophagy, was reduced in lytic LC3B KO cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that LC3B may play
a crucial role in the host antiviral response to lytic replication by mediating the nuclear export of nascent vDNA
for autophagic degradation and type III IFN expression. To test this hypothesis, we will first custom-develop
methods to detect nuclear exported (cytoplasmic and virion-free) vDNAs and identify the molecular mechanisms
of LC3B-mediated nuclear export of vDNAs by performing mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship studies
and examining the interaction between LC3B and Ku70. Secondly, we will assess the functional effects of the
LC3B/Ku70-mediated vDNA export in reactivation-induced innate immune response and lytic replication. The
proposed study should broaden our knowledge of autophagy-mediated antiviral mechanisms and provide a
molecular basis for future studies of viral evasion from these mechanisms and their therapeutic targeting in HHV-
8 diseases."

With the failure of nearly all clinical trials for AD drugs in the pipeline to date, identification of a new class of drug
candidates has become imperative to bring about effective AD therapies. A major obstacle is the lack of
promising new drug targets unrelated to the events leading to the accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau-
protein. We recently reported that linear peptide epoxyketones targeting the immunoproteasome (iP), an
inducible variant of the 20S constitutive proteasome (cP), may represent a new class of AD drugs that can
ameliorate cognitive deficits, independently of Aβ or tau accumulation. While displaying promising efficacy,
however, the prospect of these linear peptide epoxyketones for clinical use in AD appears limited at this time,
due to potential issues of having a poor brain accessibility, in vivo metabolic instability, and short circulation time
(largely attributable to the ABCB1-mediated drug efflux at the BBB and enzymatic hydrolysis by peptidases and
epoxide hydrolases). Yet, the family of peptide epoxyketones (‘short peptides with C-terminal α′,β′-epoxyketone
warhead’) remain attractive drug candidates considering their pharmacological advantages conferred by their
proven target specificity for the proteasomes and long-term safety in the clinic.
Our current findings reveal that some of the peptide epoxyketone family members containing a macrocycle have
the ability to resist the ABCB1-mediated efflux and metabolic stability superior to their linear counterparts, and
the potential to be a meaningful new treatment for patients with AD. Our objective in this application is to identify
and characterize one of these macrocyclic compounds best suited for brain iP inhibition in vivo and proceed to
the next phase of drug development. To do this, in aim 1 we will prepare the current sets of promising macrocyclic
peptide epoxyketones with different structural features that displayed comparable target inhibition and biological
activity in vitro and in cellulo on a gram scale. In aim 2, we will characterize in vivo properties of each macrocyclic
peptide epoxyketone to identify a lead drug candidate. In aim 3, we will verify in vivo efficacy and the proposed
mechanism of action of the lead drug candidate [iP inhibition → (NLRP3 inflammasome) → suppression of
microglial IL-1α release → blockade of astrocytes transformation (to A1 subtype) → neuronal survival] using two
mouse models of AD (APP/PS1 and PS19 tau transgenic mice). By completing the proposed study, we will have
identified a lead candidate with the best attributes for IND enabling studies and novel mode of action. These
results are expected to have an important positive impact by examining the validity of the previously untapped
iP-targeting approach for AD therapy and potentially offering a new direction for AD drug discovery."

The National Center for CryoEM Access and Training (NCCAT) enables users to solve macromolecular
structures rapidly and to the highest possible resolution using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) methods. We
propose to continue to: (1) Provide access to state-of-the-art equipment, (2) Maintain a highly qualified
technical team offering direct support, guidance, and assistance, (3) Operate a comprehensive cross-training
program for users across diverse skill levels and career goals, and (4) Ensure equal opportunity nationwide
access through an open and transparent application process. NCCAT is housed at the Simons Electron
Microscopy Center (SEMC) within the New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) in New York City.
NCCAT’s established operations at SEMC and NYSBC benefit from the vibrant environment and expertise of
existing highly trained staff. NCCAT occupies custom-built space that provides optimal, environmentally stable
conditions. The primary instrumentation consists of 4 dedicated Titan Krios TEMs, each equipped with direct
detectors and energy filters; 1 (soon to be 3) dedicated Glacios TEMs, each equipped with direct detectors,
and 3 side entry screening microscopes (1 of which is dedicated to NCCAT) equipped with CMOS cameras.
These are augmented by all ancillary equipment needed for the cryoEM workflow, including several classes of
vitrification and sample preparation equipment. NCCAT provides on-site, remote-access, and mail-in data
collection services with fair and equal access to a nationwide user base, and we guide and assist users with all
aspects of cryoEM, including sample preparation, data collection, data processing, data analysis, and structure
refinement. By providing users with access to streamlined workflows and resources, NCCAT allows
researchers to collect high-quality data quickly and efficiently, which will lead to faster progress in structural
biology research. NCCAT’s training program encompasses a full range of expectations, from the basics
required to ensure that users produce valid structures, through more detailed training for users seeking
independence, to those expected to run cryoEM research laboratories. A well-established grid preparation and
screening service program supports new practitioners of cryoEM methods and/or laboratories that lack local
facilities and resources to optimize sample and grid preparation conditions and, when possible, obtain
preliminary cryoEM processed data. We propose to be transformative by setting the standard for access and
training to cryoEM technology. By facilitating the shift from the current model of isolated and expensive
facilities to a unified and more efficient Center, we will enable science of the highest quality and value and
therefore provide essential foundational knowledge needed to develop new therapies, diagnostics, and clinical
practices to better human health."
10878416,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite breaking advances in melanoma treatment such as adoptive cell transfer and immune checkpoint
blockade, the clinical outcomes remain unsatisfactory due to various factors that limit the efficacy of the
therapies. To meet these challenges in immunotherapy for solid tumors, this project aims to define
eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K) as a novel and effective immune-modulatory target that can
be exploited to significantly improve effectiveness of the current cancer immunotherapy. eEF-2K belongs to
the family of atypical α-kinases and is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of protein synthesis, a molecular
process that affects energy metabolism. This kinase phosphorylates eEF-2, a 100-kDa protein that
promotes ribosomal translocation from the A to P-site, the reaction that induces movement of mRNA along
the ribosome during translation. Phosphorylated eEF2 is unable to catalyze ribosomal translocation, thereby
inhibiting peptide elongation. Our preliminary studies strongly suggest that eEF-2K is an as-yet-
unappreciated but critical regulator of antitumor immunity and that integrative targeting of this kinase may
beneficially maximize the potency of immunotherapeutic intervention against melanoma, one of the most
aggressive and fatal neoplasms responsible for over 80% of skin cancer-related deaths. Building on our
preliminary observations that eEF-2K is not only highly expressed in melanoma cells and patient specimens
and contributes to poor therapeutic outcomes, but is also abundantly expressed in immune cells such as T
cells and regulates their functional activity, we propose to test the central hypothesis that eEF-2K modulates
antitumor immunity via its regulatory roles in both tumor cells and tumor-reactive immune cells, and
integrative targeting of eEF-2K could be exploited as an innovative therapeutic strategy for treatment of
melanoma. Through comprehensive cellular, molecular, and pre-clinical studies, this multiple PIs’ project will
pursue the following highly related and interactive aims: (1) Determine the role and in-depth mechanism of
eEF-2K in immune evasion; (2) Define the role of eEF-2K as a regulator of tumor-reactive immune cells; (3)
Evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the eEF-2K-based and integrative targeted therapy. We have established
the humanized mouse (NOD-scid IL2Rgnull) melanoma models as well as murine syngeneic melanoma
systems for this research and are well poised to accomplish the above objectives. This research is
innovative and significant because successful completion of this project would not only reveal eEF-2K as a
novel and effective immuno-modulatory target for overcoming tumor immune-resistance as well as
regulating immune cell functions, but also provide new therapeutic opportunities to substantially improve
immunotherapy for advanced treatment-refractory melanoma through the eEF-2K-based integrative-
targeted approach."

Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic metabolic disease imposing great social and economic burden,
and is considered as one of the major health-threats in USA and worldwide. The morbidity of critical limb
ischemia (CLI) in diabetic patients is extremely high (up to 76% in some studies). Therefore,
understanding the mechanisms of CLI pathogenesis in diabetes is critical for developing novel
therapeutic strategies. We and others have reported that enhancing endothelial cell (EC) and endothelial
progenitor cell function improves ischemic tissue repair. Recently, there is growing evidence indicating
that diabetes severely impairs angiogenic property of EC/EPC that may directly limit CLI repair. The
overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of muscle-specific miR-499 in diabetes-impaired
EC/EPC function. The premise of our proposed studies is based on our preliminary studies showing that
expression of miR-499, a muscle-specific miR, was enhanced in EC/EPCs from db/db mice. Our central
hypothesis is that diabetes e nhanced miR-499 impairs EC/EPCs function and ischemic limb repair
via skeletal muscle-derived exosomal delivery of miR-499 to EC/EPCs. We propose to conduct
complementary experiments organized under the following 3 aims: 1. Determine the role of miR-499 in
diabetes-induced EC and EPC dysfunction; 2. Demonstrate the role of muscle-derived
exosomes in miR-499-induced EC dysfunction in diabetes; 3. Elucidate the molecular signaling
downstream of miR-499 involved in diabetes-impaired angiogenic property of EC. Our findings will
provide fundamental insights into development of novel strategies for therapeutics of CLI in diabetic
patients.

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the relationship between specific benign breast disease
(BBD) diagnoses and future breast cancer risk, and to use this knowledge to better identify groups of women at
high risk of breast cancer that may benefit from more intensive primary and/or secondary prevention strategies.
BBD is a common breast biopsy finding and encompasses a diverse spectrum of diagnoses ranging from
normal variations in breast tissue to proliferative changes with or without atypical features. Women with certain
BBD diagnoses are known to have a high risk for development of invasive breast cancer, with risk varying by
degree of histological abnormality with cancerous-like features within the benign lesion. Estimates of risk have
primarily been quantified for BBD diagnoses within known high-risk categories. It is biologically plausible that
other BBD diagnoses may also manifest as distinct risk factors for breast cancer and improve risk prediction.
However, the risks of cancer associated with many specific BBD diagnoses have not been extensively studied,
despite an increasing incidence of BBD detected by screening mammography. Moreover, associations
between BBD diagnoses and cancer risk may be modified by menopausal status or time since diagnosis.
Understanding the magnitude of breast cancer risk associated with specific BBD diagnoses and clustering
diagnoses with similar risk has the potential to inform current breast pathology practice, improve risk prediction
models, and provide evidence for the development of personalized prevention strategies. The objective of this
proposal is to characterize the future risk of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ associated
with specific BBD diagnoses typically combined into two broad categories of non-proliferative lesions and
proliferative lesions without atypia, and to identify clusters of specific diagnoses with similar risk (Aim 1).
Further, we will determine if these associations differ by menopausal status or time since BBD diagnosis (Aim
2). This application leverages the unique research resources of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium,
including a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in risk prediction modeling and risk-based
screening, biostatistics, cancer epidemiology, medicine, and pathology.
These aims will provide a critical understanding of the relationship of BBD diagnoses with future breast cancer
risk. Moreover, our work will inform current breast pathology clinical practice and the development of improved
risk prediction models, identifying lesions with similar risk. The interdisciplinary training environment for this
proposal will provide the applicant the opportunity to gain technical skills, build research competency, undergo
additional educational training, and develop content area expertise to further her career as a future
independent researcher."

 One fifth of the school-age population in the US have a chronic medical illness or disabling condition that
puts them as an educational disadvantage.1 This includes children with sickle cell disease (SCD), a chronic,
periodically disabling medical condition that principally affects people of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
(India) descent. For combination of medical, physical, and social reasons, adolescents, and teens with SCD are
at particular risk for missing school, falling behind in their education, and failing to enjoy opportunities to develop
an interest in STEMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine) subjects. Elevating
Mentoring Possibilities for Overcoming and Withstanding Educational Roadblocks in Sickle Cell Disease
(EMPOWER SCD) proposes to use children’s hospitals and their affiliated clinics as informal science education
centers wherein near-peer mentors (undergraduate engineering and health professional students from local
universities) will help middle and high school students with SCD foster an interest in STEMM.
 (Aim 1) EMPOWER SCD near-peers will facilitate biomedical engineering demonstrations, innovative hands-
on activities, presentations by senior role models who are STEMM professionals, and other activities to promote
STEMM-identity formation. Target project outcomes for EMPOWER SCD participants include improved
academic performance, the formation of a STEMM identity, and the development of aspirations for pursuing
post-secondary education in STEMM fields.
 The benefits of near-peer mentorship have been well established in other educational settings. For example,
medical schools have found that near-peer teaching/mentoring among medical students2,3 can result in positive
social, cognitive congruence, and academic outcomes4 and that college students who have been paired middle
school (11 to 14-year-olds) and high school students (14 to 18-year-olds) leads to personal and professional
growth among mentors and increased interest and engagement in STEM among mentees5.
 (Aim 2) We will create a train-the-trainer program designed to enhance the skills of EMPOWER SCD near
peers in addressing the unique challenges faced by adolescent and teenage students with sickle cell disease,
in facilitating the development of STEMM identity among mentees, and in providing academic and personal
guidance. We will also seek to match demographic characteristics such as race and gender among mentors and
mentees in order to promote bonds of trust that can lead to deeper and earlier connections6. In sum, EMPOWER
SCD will seek to improve STEMM opportunities for children with sickle cell disease by placing them in
partnerships with near-peer mentors. The overall goal of EMPOWER SCD is to inspire and help enable
people with sickle cell disease in advancing academically toward becoming researchers, physicians,
and engineers capable of diversifying the workforce and making a positive impact on society.

Cellular membranes not only compartmentalize intracellular processes but also serve as the dynamic hubs for
the assembly of many multi-protein signaling complexes, oncoproteins, and tumor suppressors. Accordingly, a
majority of current therapeutics (>60%) target membrane proteins that make up approximately 23% of human
proteome. In response to environmental cues and pharmacological drugs, the protein complement of cellular
membranes is altered to mount a calibrated response, which, if perturbed, impacts the disease state, e.g.,
cancer, cardiac and neurological disorders. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) aptly fits the task to swiftly
turnover the regulatory proteins with unmatched precision. To date, our understanding of the molecular details
of how membrane protein turnover is regulated by UPS-mediated proteolysis remain sketchy.
We are conducting the mechanistic studies in the investigations of novel UPS-regulated protein degradation
pathways at membranes modeled on our previous work with FBXL2, a highly conserved F-box protein
containing a typical C-terminal CaaX prenylation motif for localization to cellular membranes. The integrity of
the CaaX motif is necessary for FBXL2 to assemble into an active SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and interact
with two substrates, p85β and IP3R3, at cellular membranes. Interestingly, we recently discovered GGtase3, a
new mammalian prenyltransferase and identified FBXL2-ubiquitin ligase as the physiological target for
prenylation by GGTase3. This proposal uses an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the regulation and
biological relevance of membrane anchored protein turnover by UPS in mammalian cell survival and
proliferation, and full characterization of GGtase3 biology."
10890786,"Biomedical research is expanding rapidly in the US; however, minorities continue to be
underrepresented in this workforce, constituting ~29% of the US population, but receiving only
~7% of PhD degrees and only ~4% of NIH RO1 grants. Many minority students lack early
engagement and opportunities to develop skills and content knowledge to complete BS programs.
For over 10 years Jefferson State Community College (JSCC) and the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) have partnered to develop a dynamic program to bridge minority
JSCC students into undergraduate and graduate biomedical and behavioral education and
careers. Our current Bridges to Biomedical Careers grant (BBC) predicted that 75% of students
would gain a BS in 5 years, 35% would enter biomedical graduate education and 35% would
enter biomedical careers. Of the 95 students in BBC, 98% have completed or are currently
completing a BS in biomedical/behavioral sciences in 5 years or less, 100% are minorities,
and 75% are in (or applying for) biomedical and behavioral graduate programs. The
remaining 25% are pursuing research careers with their BS. One of the greatest challenges for
students in BBC has been their need to work during the school year to pay for their tuition,
decreasing the time they could work on their research. The new NIGMS B2B program
addresses this challenge by funding students to carry out research throughout the entire year,
starting with a summer research internship in their rising sophomore year. Bridges-UAB
takes advantage of this greater student funding to enhance student success even further. It
will include a very rigorous recruitment of freshman students at JSCC, including a research
workshop and intro to research course and develop other JSCC and UAB partnership
biomedical courses. Bridges-UAB will promote closer interactions between JSCC and UAB in
research and education and provide students at JSCC and UAB with educational opportunities,
internships and mentoring that will immerse them into biomedical and behavioral research
and prepare them for research careers. Bridges-UAB will provide scholarships to
cover the sophomore and junior years, and UAB plans to cover most senior year costs, thus
paving the way for the students to focus on learning and their cutting-edge research. Upper-
level students will be encouraged to be peer mentors to newer students, and top Bridges-UAB
students will return to present their research at JSCC in the workshop and other courses,
encouraging the JSCC students to consider research careers. The Broader Impact will be to
expand the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. The Intellectual Merit will be to identify
methods that engage and prepare minority students for careers in biomedical research."

New American Youth on the Rise (NAYR) is a burgeoning mentorship and enrichment program for
middle and high school girls from “New American” immigrant groups in Chittenden County (VT). NAYR aims to
foster health equity for local immigrant communities by 1) developing a pathway to college careers in health
sciences thereby enhancing representation in the healthcare workforce, and 2) increasing trust between the
academic health center and local community by demonstrating investment in the community. Using the novel
concept of “cocooning,” NAYR surrounds immigrant and 1st-generation American girls with home, school,
and individual support necessary to succeed in middle and high school and ultimately transition into health
sciences undergraduate degree programs. NAYR runs during the academic year (weekly + intensives) and the
summer months. NAYR activities include: Courses for Skills Development, Research Experiences, Mentoring
Activities, and Outreach.
NAYR works from an interprofessional lens to guide participants into the “best fit” health science
professions. With the collaboration between the University of Vermont’s (UVM) Larner College of Medicine
(LCOM), College of Nursing and Health Sciences (CNHS), and College of Education and Social Services
(CESS), many college paths are possible. Moreover, NAYR students are mentored by professional women in
health sciences (physicians, researchers, nursing and health science leaders) who embody the possibilities
and opportunities to which they can aspire. Finally, NAYR is built around the acknowledgement that a
student's success is a factor of not only the student’s effort and desire, but also the influence of her family and
teachers/school counselors.
Over the last 18 months, we have developed the structure and function of NAYR with collaboration
between LCOM, UVM Medical Center, and the local New American community. Through a competitive award
process, UVM Medical Center granted seed funding (PI Dougherty) to develop NAYR in direct cooperation with
the local immigrant community. This new SEPA application will build on the work that is ongoing and move
NAYR from the development into the implementation phase in which we will launch NAYR programming
for a grade 6-9 cohort of girls from our New American community. We will then add a class each year until the
cohort make-up is grades 6-12. Furthermore, this SEPA application requests funding to support a true
interprofessional approach including leadership from CNHS as well as pedagogical support and sound
educational footing from our colleagues in CESS."

This application is for an administrative supplement to Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development
Award (K08 DE031029) for Dr. Lauren Katz McKay. She is currently conducting research on craniofacial skeletal
muscle and has observed that this muscle type has a unique regenerative program compared to muscles of the
limb and trunk. This K08 will enhance Dr. McKay’s ability to 1) become an expert in craniofacial muscle stem
cells and regeneration, 2) conduct basic science research at the highest level in a tissue rarely studied, 3) acquire
cutting-edge skills in stem cell techniques including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and ex vivo cell
transplantation, 4) gain skills in proposal development, manuscript preparation, and data presentation, and 5)
develop a high-quality independent research program that will allow for collaborative opportunities with scientists
and clinicians from across disciplines. To achieve these goals, Dr. McKay has devised a clear and focused
training plan and has identified individuals who are experts in the aforementioned disciplines. Her
multidisciplinary mentoring team consists of: Drs. James White (basic scientist, skeletal muscle regeneration
and stem cells), Shannon Wallet (basic scientist, oral and craniofacial research), Elisabeth Barton (basic
scientist, skeletal muscle regeneration), Kevin Byrd (clinician-scientist, oral stem cells), Lyndon Cooper (clinician-
scientist, oral stem cells), Eric Everett (basic scientist, oral biology), Jimena Giudice (basic scientist, skeletal
muscle research), and Simon Gregory (basic scientist, scRNA-seq). There exists a clinical need to rebuild
functional craniofacial muscle in patients suffering from certain diseases (muscular dystrophy, hemifacial
microsomia), facial trauma, and tumor resections. The lack of a comprehensive investigation of the craniofacial
musculature and its stem population has resulted in a poor understanding of the regenerative capacity of this
tissue when faced with disease or trauma. Our current knowledge of skeletal muscles and their stem cell
populations comes from the limb muscles; however, it is known that distinct differences in embryological origin
exist between muscles of the limb and those of the craniofacial region. Therefore, the objectives of this study
are to use injury models to elucidate the in vivo regenerative capacity of craniofacial skeletal muscle and to
perform deep phenotyping on isolated craniofacial satellite cells to identify molecular targets specific to
craniofacial muscle regeneration. Regenerative capacity will be assessed using in vivo models of muscle
regeneration and in vitro cellular function assays (Aim 1). scRNA-seq and ex vivo stem cell transplantation will
be utilized to identify craniofacial muscle-specific regulators of myogenesis (Aim 2) and identified targets will be
investigated using lentiviral vectors and knockout models (Aim 3). Together, the K08 training and mentorship will
enable Dr. McKay to transition into an independent research career and become a leader in the field of
craniofacial muscle regenerative medicine and translational therapeutics."

 This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across
the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and
biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific
questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical
technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis
capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a
panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the
most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is
central to the CF treatment.
 Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β-
hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride,
pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile
(which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these
engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate
on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine
learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities
and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat
readings.
 In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to
non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both
healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first
measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients
intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their
circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context
of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform
a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring
capabilities rendered by our solution.
 The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies
to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine."

This project aims to understand the function and regulation of three ion channels that conduct K+ across cell
membranes and belong to the two-pore domain K+ channel family. We will apply cryo-electron microscopy to
determine structures of the channels in different functional states within lipid environments that mimic the
cellular membrane and electrophysiological recordings to characterize their activities in order to derive physical
models for channel gating and modulation. We aim to capture structural snapshots of the different open and
closed conformations for each channel by varying conditions that alter channel function including solution
composition, lipid composition, and presence of small molecules or interacting proteins. The three channels
are members of different branches of the two-pore domain K+ channel family. While they share a common
structural architecture, each channel is regulated by pH in a different way; one is inhibited by protons on both
sides of the membrane, the second is inhibited only by extracellular protons, and the third is both inhibited and
altered in its ionic selectivity by extracellular protons. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which pH is
sensed and converted into a change in channel activity are correspondingly different between the channels.
Each channel is further regulated by a distinct set of factors including signaling lipids, interacting proteins,
solution ion composition, and small molecule drugs. Comparative analyses of the three structurally and
evolutionarily related K+ channels will therefore provide additional insight into their functional properties and
biological roles. Two-pore domain K+ channels mediate cellular electrical signaling by establishing and
maintaining the resting membrane potential and opposing excitability. The channels under study here are
involved in respiratory regulation, cardiac rhythm generation, blood pressure control, central chemoreception,
and systemic pH homeostasis among other processes. Their dysregulation is implicated in cardiac arrythmia,
kidney disease, and hypertension in humans and they are targets of anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, and drugs
under investigation for obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, in addition to providing fundamental mechanistic
insight into the physical and chemical basis for channel function, this work will serve as a basis for the
development of more potent and specific pharmacological agents targeting ion channels to promote health and
treat disease. Importantly, the technical and methodological advances developed here for structural
characterization of small membrane proteins in lipid environments are expected to be widely applicable and will
facilitate insights across the breadth of biology in which membrane proteins play important roles."
10890644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
My career goal is to bridge the gap between tendon basic science and clinical research to optimize treatment of tendon
injuries, using individualized load and recovery prescription. To achieve this goal and fill gaps in my experience, I have
designed a development plan which will provide training and mentorship in administration of clinical trials and large
multicenter studies, applying and interpreting mixed-effects models, and understanding of tissue biology. The research
activities will provide complimentary experience and pilot data to establish myself as an independent clinician-scientist.
Rationale: Healthy tendon function is critical to preserving quality of life. Overuse tendon injuries are rampant across
society, occurring at a rate exceeding hip and knee osteoarthritis combined. These injuries impact the structural and
mechanical properties of the tendon, which reduces tendon function, lower extremity performance, participation in daily
activities, and ultimately, quality of life. Treatments for tendon injuries are designed to promote tendon remodeling, with
the goal of restoring structure, mechanical properties, and tendon function. However, pain is the primary measure used
to assess treatment effectiveness in clinical settings, which is a poor measure of tendon remodeling. Thus, clinicians are
using interventions without the ability to determine whether the application is appropriate, increasing the risk of residual
impairments and injury recurrence. This gap between research and the clinic is due to a poor understanding of tendon
tissue changes in humans and their clinical implications. Changes in tendon structure and mechanical properties precedes
the development of symptoms, making it difficult to capture pre-injury values of these properties. Without pre-injury
values, it has not been possible to determine the degree of change due to injury, the expected trajectory of recovery, or
how these changes relate to clinical outcomes. The tendon graft harvest site may provide a new model for studying tendon
injuries, providing the opportunity to capture pre-harvest measures of structural and mechanical properties.
Specific Aims: (1) To identify changes in graft site structure after graft harvest. (2) To identify changes in graft site
mechanical properties after graft harvest. (3) To determine the association between changes in graft site structural and
mechanical properties with clinical outcomes after graft harvest.
Methods: This will be an ancillary, single-site, prospective cohort study of participants in the STABILITY 2 Trial at the
University of Pittsburgh, which aims to identify optimal graft choice in patients at high risk of failed anterior cruciate
ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Evaluations will be completed pre-surgery, and 6 weeks, 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months after
ACLR with a patellar or quadriceps tendon graft to evaluate changes in graft site structural and mechanical properties,
quadriceps muscle performance, tendon pain, and lower extremity function. These measures will be combined with
existing outcomes from the STABILITY 2 Trial to obtain a complete picture of participants’ clinical status.
Clinical Impact: Findings will improve our understanding of tendon healing, provide a new model for testing interventions,
and accelerate the adoption of suitable outcome measures for tendon injury. Long-term, this may prevent residual
impairments in tendon function and restore participation in daily activities and quality of life."
10890646,"BDNF and other neurotrophins (NTs) have widespread and powerful roles in the mammalian nervous system,
and are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, as well as in a number of psychiatric
and neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Rett
syndrome, drug addiction, schizophrenia, and depression. However, how NTs function at the cellular and
synaptic levels is not well understood. For example, it is not clear whether NTs are released from or act on the
pre- or postsynaptic neuron, or whether and how multiple mammalian NTs interact at a single synapse. Aplysia
sensory-motor neuron cell culture is an ideal system for addressing these types of questions. We had previously
identified an Aplysia BDNF ortholog (ApNT) and its Trk receptor (ApTrk) and found that they are important for
the induction of long-term facilitation (LTF) and consolidation of short-term (ST) to early intermediate-term (IT)
facilitation. Our results do not support the simple linear cascade that we and others had expected, but rather
reveal that ApNT plays surprising roles in two synaptic feedback loops: [1] as an autocrine signal in a presynaptic
positive feedback loop that amplifies the molecules required, and [2] as both an anterograde and retrograde
signal in a transynaptic feedback loop that coordinates mechanisms in the presynaptic and postsynaptic
compartments. These loops provide novel mechanisms for consolidation of learning-related plasticity that could
well contribute more generally. We now propose to extend those studies in three new directions:
 1. The roles of ApNT and ApTrk in consolidation of long-term plasticity. We will investigate the roles of ApNT
and ApTrk in consolidation of early IT to late IT and LT plasticity. We will also explore possible functions of the
feedback loops, and investigate the roles of ApNT and ApTrk in gene regulation and the assembly of pre- and
postsynaptic components in a synaptic growth cascade.
 2. The roles of pro and mature isoforms of ApNT. Like other neurotrophins ApNT has pro and mature forms
whose relative functions are unclear. Investigating the roles of those isoforms of a NT is much easier in the
Aplysia system, which only has a single neurotrophin. Our preliminary results suggest the hypothesis that
release of the mature form from sensory neurons may act as an autocrine signal that contributes to induction of
facilitation, whereas release of the pro form from motor neurons may act as a retrograde signal that contributes
to stabilization, perhaps by interacting with CPEB or PKM. We will test that hypothesis in several ways.
 3. The causal roles of ApNT and ApTrk and their integration with other mechanisms during behavioral learning.
The exact roles of neurotrophins in behavioral learning and memory are also unclear. To address that question,
we have been studying mechanisms of simple forms of learning under physiological conditions in a reduced
preparation of the Aplysia siphon withdrawal reflex. We will now use that preparation to explore the causal roles of
ApNT and ApTrk and their integration with other cellular and molecular mechanisms during behavioral learning."
10890728,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Latino children experience increased incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as disparities
in treatment response, relapse, and survival. However, to date, there have been few studies evaluating the
impact of persistent neurocognitive symptoms on educational and economic outcomes in Latino survivors. What
has been demonstrated by our group and others is that disparities among Latino children with ALL are not fully
explained by non-genetic factors, such as differences in treatment adherence. In fact, biological factors
contribute to these outcomes: Native American genetic ancestry has been implicated in relapse among Latinos
with ALL and is related to neurotoxicity during treatment. Building from this work, we explore two unanswered
questions: 1) what is the burden of neurocognitive deficits among Latino children diagnosed with ALL relative to
non-Latino children, and 2) what is the relative contribution of clinical, socioeconomic, cultural, and biological
factors in explaining neurocognitive disparities among childhood ALL survivors. We will leverage our ongoing
Reducing Ethnic Disparities in Acute Leukemia (REDIAL) cohort to conduct deep neurocognitive phenotyping in
a subset of the population (N=400) diagnosed and treated for ALL – with a particular focus on Latinos, who make
up more than 50 percent of the ongoing cohort. We will model neurocognitive performance from diagnosis
through 7 years post-diagnosis by employing an accelerated longitudinal cohort design, which includes annual
assessments for: 1) newly diagnosed patients in the first years of the grant (Wave 1, n = 200); and 2) survivors
who are 3-7 years post diagnosis (Wave 2, n = 200). We also incorporate factors that have yet to be included in
models of neurocognitive outcomes among children diagnosed with ALL, such as measures of socioeconomic
status (SES), acculturation, English-language proficiency, and genetic ancestry. Our research aims are to: 1)
characterize the trajectory of neurocognitive performance in Latino children diagnosed with ALL; 2) examine the
impact of clinical, individual and neighborhood socioeconomic factors, and level of acculturation among Latinos;
and 3) assess the relative contribution of genetic ancestry to neurocognitive performance in children diagnosed
with ALL. Strengths of our approach include rigorous preliminary data, a recruitment infrastructure for enrolling
Latino patients diagnosed with ALL, existing data and samples collected as part of our ongoing REDIAL cohort,
an unparalleled research environment, and a geographical region that is ethnically and socioeconomically
diverse. This proposal has significant translational potential to improve the clinical management of
neurocognitive outcomes in this population, as it will identify children at risk for neurocognitive difficulties and in
greatest need of intervention, critical points in treatment/survivorship when intervention strategies may help to
mitigate disparities in neurocognitive outcomes, and targets for intervention."

 This proposal, entitled Increasing Diversity in Genomics for the Next generation (IDGeNe), is a proposal
from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus in response to the NIH-GREAT call for proposals. The
long-term goal of the IDGeNe program is to increase the diversity of the Genomic field workforce by establishing
a cohort of interested students that will receive academic and professional training in genomic-related research.
The program will benefit a student population over 95% Hispanics of different gender, race, social status and
physical needs.
 The core of the program is a comprehensive research experience for undergraduate students and a
series of activities that will reinforce students identity as researchers and prepared them for graduate work. The
training program consists of two major components: with (1) a “hands-on” in depth research experience and (2)
a series of activities aimed at developing not only their research potential but also the professional tools needed
to succeed in future careers. A cohort of 8 undergraduate students from UPR-Rio Piedras will be recruited
annually for a 2-year internship in the program. Students will receive in-house training in professional
development during the first summer via courses, workshops and other activities. During the two years in the
program, students will work on a project in genomic research in the laboratory of one of the local mentors while
participating in seminars and workshops and professional development activities. Students will also undergo a
8-10 week summer research experience at some of the top-mainland institutions, including: Univ. Pittsburgh,
Univ. Wisconsin, UC Santa Cruz, UT Southwestern, UC San Francisco and Harvard University. Upon completion
of the program, students will be well prepared to continue their education in MS or PhD programs, enter fields of
interest, such as Genomic Medicine or Public Health or integrate directly into the Genomics workforce.
 The program takes advantage of the strong expertise in genomics and genomic-related fields among the
UPR faculty. Twenty-two UPR faculty whose research involves genomics/bioinformatics will participate as
possible mentors in the Program. Collectively these faculty members have mentored hundreds of undergraduate
students in their labs and have vast experience to implement and carry forward a highly successful research and
mentoring program. Dr. Jose E. Garcia-Arraras a Professor from the Biology department whose research
involves the genomics of organ regeneration will be the P.I. He will be assisted by Dr. Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga
(co-P.I.) an expert in computer-based genome analyses and by collaborators that will strengthen the areas of
Statistics, Data Science and Mentoring.
 This proposal builds upon the experiences gathered in different programs by the UPR and its faculty, to
enhance and strengthen the mentoring and training activities of Under Represented Minority students to make
them competitive for graduate school and beyond."
10890768,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea by employing guide RNAs and
endonuclease effectors to specifically recognize and cleave invasive nucleic acids. The specific DNA targeting
and cleavage activities of CRISPR-Cas systems have been adopted and developed for genome editing and
various other applications, which are revolutionizing biomedical research and beyond. However, safety
concerns are raised because of off-target genome editing and the dependence of these systems on
endogenous host DNA repair pathways, hindering clinical application. Exploration of alternative CRISPR-Cas
systems in nature not only offers an opportunity to overcome those challenges but may also inspire new
applications. Structural and biochemical characterizations of CRISPR-Cas systems are critical for
understanding their mechanisms and repurposing them for precise genome editing. Our long-term goals are to
unravel the mechanisms underlying target nucleic acid recognition and cleavage mediated by type V and
transposon-associated CRISPR-Cas systems, which provide essential knowledge for safer and more reliable
application in treating human disease. In this proposal, we will work on the molecular mechanisms for four
newly discovered CRISRP-Cas systems, covering DNA targeting (Cas12i), RNA targeting (Cas12g), and
CRISPR RNA-guided DNA transposition (type I-F Cascade and Cas12k). As revealed in our preliminary data,
Cas12i accommodates a longer crRNA-DNA heteroduplex than currently used Cas effectors, thus potentially
improving specificity for genome editing. The RNA-guided RNase Cas12g is compact and thermostable,
highlighting its potential for RNA editing and RNA targeting. Furthermore, type I-F Cascade and Cas12k direct
transposition machinery for RNA-guided DNA transposition, opening a new paradigm for genome editing
independent of DNA repair pathways.

10890678,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is frequently accompanied by the development of cachexia, a multi-systemic wasting
syndrome that affects the majority of patients, especially when the disease recurs by forming liver metastases
(LMs). Muscle and bone loss are amongst the most detrimental symptoms of cachexia and directly cause
increased morbidity and mortality. We and others have shown that CRC also promotes metabolic and genomic
perturbations of the liver, and further, that formation of LMs exacerbates muscle and bone wasting.
Unfortunately, no cure is available for cachexia, and research on liver contribution to musculoskeletal wasting in
cancer has been lacking; hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments for cachexia-related
musculoskeletal symptoms. In this regard, our preliminary findings suggest that IGFBP1, a liver-derived hormone
belonging to the insulin-like growth factor family of binding proteins (IGFBPs), plays a causative role in cancer-
associated musculoskeletal complications.
In our preliminary studies, IGFBP1 was found elevated in CRC patients and in CRC hosts, along with muscle
and bone loss. IGFBP1 induced myotube atrophy and osteoclast differentiation. Mice bearing subcutaneous C26
CRC displayed muscle atrophy, but no bone loss, whereas mice bearing C26 LMs showed marked muscle and
bone wasting, along with dramatically elevated IGFBP1. Anti-IGFBP1 treatments prevented CRC-induced
myofiber atrophy and osteoclastogenesis in vitro, whereas depletion of liver IGFBP1 abolished bone loss and
improved muscle wasting in CRC hosts. IGFBP1 was also found elevated in mixed hepatocyte-CRC cultures
and in the liver of metastatic CRC hosts, suggesting a role of IGFBP1 in cancer dissemination.
The objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which IGFBP1 drives bone loss and contributes to
muscle wasting in CRC. Our central hypothesis is that elevated IGFBP1 exacerbates CRC-induced cachexia by
triggering events consistent with musculoskeletal wasting. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism(s) by
which IGFBP1 triggers bone loss in CRC. We hypothesize that in CRC elevated IGFBP1 signals through ITGB1
and promotes osteoclastogenesis, hence bone loss. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism(s) by which
IGFBP1 causes muscle wasting in CRC. We hypothesize that high IGFBP1 participates in muscle atrophy. In
Aim 3, we will explore the role of the liver microenvironment in the exacerbation of CRC cachexia. We
hypothesize that tumor dissemination to the liver determines changes in gene expression in both hepatocytes
and cancer cells consistent with enhanced growth rates and altered expression of IGFBP1 and other liver- and
tumor-derived soluble factors.
Our findings will define the mechanistic effects of IGFBP1 in cachexia and identify IGFBP1 as a new therapeutic
target for the treatment of multi-organ complications in CRC. These results will also open new avenues for
cachexia research."

Receipt of individual NIH career development awards has been instrumental to the professional trajectories of
physician-scientists. However, submitting competitive applications for these awards is difficult without formal
mentorship, defined expectations, protected time, and coordinated curricula. The USC R25 Neurosurgery
Research Education Program provides the resources, mentorship, and support required to address many of
these challenges. The R25 program has advanced a culture of academic research and development of
clinician-scientists that has directly benefited the residents and junior faculty members within the USC
Department of Neurosurgery. The proposed renewal application seeks to build upon the early successes from
the initial funding cycle. This competitive renewal application leverages a similar structure to the first five years
of the program but incorporates changes/ improvements based on learning and feedback. Mentors are
clinicians and scientists with federal funding and prior track records notable for successful mentorship. Thirty-
five faculty members from seventeen different academic departments across the university are included as
mentors and advisors. A multi-tiered mentorship system affords each R25 trainee a research supervisor for
his/her direct investigative study, guidance from a Neurosurgery Research Mentorship Committee and career
development support from a team of clinician-scientists within the candidate’s chosen neurosurgery/
neuroscience subspecialty. A Transition to Academic Faculty Committee provides sustained guidance and
oversight to R25 graduates during their final years of residency training and initial junior faculty appointments.
The USC Neurosurgery residency program has been restructured to incorporate a dedicated R25 research
track that differs from the traditional clinical pathway. An innovative Senior/ Junior mentorship program will
allow R25 trainees to receive formal guidance from early career investigators in addition to experienced
scientists/ mentors. Dedicated discussions and instruction focusing on ethical and successful scientific practice
have been incorporated into the program. The over-arching aim of the proposal is to develop neurosurgeon-
scientists capable of securing NIH K-, and ultimately R-, series funding to support independent research."
10890681,"It has been well documented that the outcomes of success for botanical clinical trials have been poor, leading
to greater effort into understanding the basic mechanisms underlying their activity. While it is often
hypothesized that botanicals or other complex mixtures work through synergistic or additive processes, there
are few proven examples. There is also growing belief to support the role of gut microbiome metabolism for
generation of active metabolites, however, relatively few experimental results back this up. This is driven by
limitations in obtaining clear biological signatures in relevant biological assays, in accurately defining the
chemical constitution of complex mixtures, and in the informatics approaches to bring these disparate data
types together. This proposal aims to address these important questions by the development and
implementation of technology platforms. In project 1, we will employ highly innovative orthogonal cell-based
high content phenotypic screening approaches in primary macrophages, epithelial cells, primary neurons,
which will give us comprehensive coverage of signaling pathway and receptor that are believed to be relevant
to botanicals. These platforms aim to link botanicals/bioactive molecules of interest together with information
about their molecular targets. These platforms have been demonstrated to work with complex mixtures as well
as pure compounds and are supported by the development of bioinformatic approaches that allow integration
of orthogonal biological activity. Our second project will take advantage of developments in untargeted
metabolomics, along with feature reduction, to have a robust pipeline to clearly define the constitution of
complex mixtures. Our third project specifically addresses the question of synergy and additivity by the
development of informatics approaches that use the comprehensive biological and chemical signatures
generated in the other projects. In this project, we will develop universal tools that will allow the community to
probe their own biological and chemical assay results to generate compound/activity maps. This program will
deliver critical technology platforms for the in-depth study of botanicals and natural products and deliver tools
that can be used by the community"

Cytokinesis, the division of a cell into two daughter cells, serves as an elegant cell behavior that highlights the
biomechanical systems required for many cell shape change processes. Over the life of this grant, we have
demonstrated how an interplay of active force production, cortical tension, surface curvature, and viscoelasticity
drive cytokinesis furrow ingression. We identified key molecular pathways that control these properties and found
that the circuitry is wired like a control system complete with feedback loops that allows mechanical and chemical
signals to tune the accumulation of the contractile machinery. In this proposal, we will build upon our
understanding of cytokinesis and this mechano-responsive contractility network. We use a suite of techniques,
including genetics, proteomics, Single Molecule Pulldown (SiMPull), and Fluorescence Correlation and Cross-
Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) to study this network. We discovered that many of the proteins in the
mechano-responsive contractility network are organized into complexes in the cytoplasm, forming Contractility
Kits (CKs). Several CK components have unknown functions in the context of cell contractility and are the subject
of this proposal. Among these, the lectin discoidin 1A, traditionally viewed as a secreted protein, assembles with
the CKs in the cytoplasm and is necessary for a key protein, the actin crosslinker cortexillin I, to localize fully to
the cortex. Moreover, discoidin 1A has a complex genetic relationship with cortexillin I and its binding partner
and regulator IQGAP2. We will determine how discoidin 1 operates in the CKs and promotes cortical assembly.
Next, we are studying two ribonucleoproteins, RNP1A and RNP1B. Both proteins contain predicted RNA-
recognition motifs. RNP1A is also required for normal cortexillin I mRNA levels. We originally identified RNP1A
over-expression as a genetic suppressor of the microtubule-destabilizer nocodazole (same study that gave rise
to the RacE-14-3-3-myosin II pathway that we discovered). We have now found that RNP1A is required for
normal microtubule length. Given the changes in mRNA levels of cortexillin I, we conducted RNAseq analysis
and found that several CK proteins have altered gene expression in rnp1A knockdown cells. To identify RNAs
that the RNP1s might bind, we are using CLIP-Seq and have already found in a preliminary study that RNP1B
may bind to 14-3-3 mRNA. Here, we will flesh out how the RNP1s impact CK assembly and expression. Finally,
we discovered that the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT, encoded by ancA in Dictyostelium) interacts
genetically with myosin II and racE. Intriguingly, we are finding that CK protein nulls (e.g., cortexillin I) have
reduced metabolic activity, leading to reduced ATP production and a lower energetic state. We will probe how
increasing energy production through ANT can bypass some of the cellular functions of the CK proteins. Overall,
these studies will seek to decipher how the CK network operates and integrates with other processes, such as
mRNA levels and metabolism, leading to a deeper understanding of the cell shape change process more
generally."

(Imaging Technologist). In the most recent award year, the OISR was used by 21 Cancer Center members with
peer-reviewed funding, which comprises 27% of the total Shared Resource users."
10893005,"The period immediately following inpatient psychiatric hospital discharge poses an extremely high risk of
suicide. Among youth, roughly 20% of all suicide deaths occur in those who had an inpatient hospital stay in
the year before death. This concentration of suicide risk should stimulate research on developing and
evaluating strategies that protect young patients from suicide during this critical transition period. Unfortunately,
well-established interventions for safe transitional care to prevent suicide do not exist. We propose to develop
an interactive intervention “Safer Still” to help promote safe storage of firearms during the critical period
immediately following psychiatric hospitalization. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among
adolescents in the United States, and firearms are used in more than 40% of these deaths. Our innovative
intervention entails no clinician involvement outside of routine care and is based on behavioral economics
(BE), a model that features insights from psychology, economics, and marketing to enhance individual decision
making. Through technology, we will implement a series of BE “nudges” to promote safe firearm storage in a
sample of parents of adolescents at high risk for suicide who own firearms and have disclosed unsafe
household storage practices. The aims of this hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study will be
achieved in two phases. First, guided by the PRISM (Practical, Robust, Implementation, and Sustainability
Model) framework, the Safer Still intervention will be refined based on clinician and family feedback from key
informant interviews and participant usability testing phases. We will use PRISM domains to increase our
understanding of Safer Still implementation and sustainability. Second, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will
be conducted to test the effectiveness of Safer Still, while systematically collecting data related to the potential
implementation in real-world settings. During the RCT, we will recruit 80 firearm-owning parents or guardians
of adolescents aged 12-17 years living in households with unsafe firearm storage and randomly assign them to
either the Safer Still intervention (n=40) or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; n=40). Our central hypothesis is that
Safer Still will be superior to EUC in reducing unsafe household firearm storage after hospital discharge. Our
secondary aim is to examine clinician and family perspectives on the acceptability, feasibility, and
appropriateness of Safer Still. We will also examine a potential mediator (stages of change) and two
moderators (adolescent history of a suicide attempt and parental primary reason for firearm ownership) of
intervention effects. Our investigative team offers an extensive track record in youth suicide prevention
research, BE, mental health intervention research, lethal means restriction, culturally informed health services,
and technology intervention development and deployment. Our project will be conducted through inpatient and
crisis stabilization units of one of the largest pediatric behavioral health providers in the United States. Our
long-term goal is to decrease suicide in at-risk youth through preventative interventions."
10893007,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death for US adolescents. Youth at highest risk of suicide are often ad-
mitted to inpatient psychiatric units when safety in the community is unable to be maintained. However, access
to these services has decreased over the last several decades as availability of adolescent inpatient psychiat-
ric beds has steadily declined. Against this backdrop, inpatient admissions for suicidal behavior and intentional
self-injury among youth have more than doubled from 2006 to 2015. Limited access to, and demand for these
services has created the need for additional options to provide short-term crisis intervention and stabilization
services in a secure setting. In direct response to PAR-20-286, this proposal examines high-impact practice-
based research with near-term potential to address NIMH suicide prevention priorities. We previously devel-
oped Intensive Crisis Intervention (ICI), a brief, evidence-based treatment that incorporates Family Therapy/
Parent Training, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Motivational Interviewing to target family functioning in re-
ducing adolescent suicidal behavior. An open pilot trial on our Youth Crisis Stabilization Unit (YCSU) demon-
strated that ICI is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improved clinical outcomes over a 3-month follow-
up period. In addition, average length of stay for adolescents receiving ICI was 5.8 days briefer than those re-
ceiving traditional psychiatric inpatient care. There were no significant differences in readmission rates or time
to readmission across the two settings. We now propose to further develop and test ICI. We will recruit 80 ado-
lescents presenting to Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) Psychiatric Crisis Department with suicidal idea-
tion and behavior that are eligible for admission to both the NCH YCSU and Adolescent Psychiatric Inpatient
Unit. During Year 1, 20 adolescents and one of their parents/guardians will be enrolled in a nonrandomized
case series. In-depth qualitative interviews with patients, parents, and providers will be used to further refine
the ICI manual, training and supervision protocols, and fidelity/adherence measures, and identify barriers to,
and facilitators of implementation and sustainability. In Years 2 and 3, 60 adolescents will be enrolled in a ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) comparing ICI with traditional inpatient psychiatric treatment. The project’s main
goal is to examine feasibility, acceptability, research implementation procedures, and preliminary effectiveness
of ICI using a mixed-methods approach. We hypothesize that ICI will be acceptable to families and show
greater improvements in our proposed mechanism of change, family functioning, compared with traditional in-
patient treatment at discharge, 30 days, and 3-month follow-up. Secondary aims will assess preliminary treat-
ment effects of ICI on suicidal ideation, attempts, ED/hospital admission, hopelessness and therapeutic alli-
ance. This application builds directly from our initial promising findings as the next step in strengthening the
research evidence base and pragmatic clinical materials for ICI as an effective model of care for adolescent
suicidal behavior that can be implemented and sustained across diverse pediatric settings to help save lives."

The HIV-1 envelope spike (Env) bears a cluster of oligomannose-type glycans that is a target for broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). However, while nAbs to this cluster, dubbed the high-mannose patch
(HMP), are known to develop in at least some HIV-infected individuals, past attempts to elicit similar
antibodies by immunization have been largely unsuccessful. Most previous approaches have involved
presenting clusters of natural or synthetic high-mannose glycans on the surface of carrier proteins. The
difficulty in eliciting high-mannose-targeting nAbs by immunization is believed to relate, at least in part,
to the ‘self’ nature of the targeted glycans; naïve B cells bearing Ig receptors of the desired fine specificity
or affinity might be anergic or at relatively low frequency due to tolerance mechanisms.
The approach that we are pursuing is based on the scientific premise that antigenic mimicry of
mammalian host structures can stimulate cross-reactive antibodies if such mimics are presented in the
proper ‘foreign’ milieu. Our overarching hypothesis is that, upon immunization, an antigenic mimic of
mammalian oligomannose will more readily elicit antibodies that bind the HMP than native or synthetic
oligomannose. In our progress report, we show that a CRM197-conjugate of our lead oligomannose
mimetic, the design of which is inspired by a bacterial polysaccharide with resemblance to mammalian
oligomannose, is bound with high avidity by various HMP-specific bnAbs as well as their germline
precursors. Furthermore, human antibody transgenic mice immunized with this neoglycoconjugate yield
antibodies that bind recombinant HIV-1 SOSIP trimers, albeit only when the conjugate is formulated in
the TLR4-stimulating Th1-adjuvant GLA-SE; not when formulated in Th2- or mixed Th1/2-adjuvants.
Based on our findings so far, we propose in this renewal application to extend our investigations. A first
step (Aim 1) will be to probe the relevance of Th1 stimulation further, by assessing immunogenicity of
our lead glycoconjugate when formulated with other Th1-directing adjuvants. These additional adjuvants
will not be agonistic for TLR4, thus helping to reveal whether stimulating TLR4 is relevant. We will assess
also (Aim 2) the significance of antigenic mimicry for triggering high mannose-specific antibodies, by
comparing the immunogenicity of our lead mimetic to synthetic oligomannose. We will evaluate also
whether incorporating an archetypical component of gram-negative bacterial LPS –Kdo and lipid A—into
our lead glycoside is immunologically beneficial. Our third step (Aim 3) will be to investigate whether
injecting glycoconjugate-primed transgenic mice at specific time points with select SOSIP trimers boosts
nAb titers. We expect our findings to help sharpen our strategy and critically inform the pursuit of future
preclinical studies. Results from this research could inform other HIV vaccine design strategies also."

Investigations of Proteome Turnover Kinetics Under Cellular Differentiation: Proteins are in a constant flux
of continuous synthesis and degradation, both of which contribute to regulate protein levels in the cell. Although
this fact has been known for 80 years, currently most biological inquiries are limited to static snapshots of
overall transcript and protein levels, whereas knowledge into the dynamic changes of protein turnover remains
severely lagging. This ESI MIRA proposal seeks to advance the current understanding of how cellular
proteomes remodel during cell state transitions, by incorporating protein turnover kinetics information at key
stages of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) differentiation into distinct cellular lineages. Working with
collaborators, we previously developed deuterium stable isotope labeling, mass spectrometry, and kinetic
modeling methods to quantitate protein turnover in animal models and in human. In doing so, we found many
novel cell states and disease markers may be discovered from integrating orthogonal protein abundance and
kinetics information. In the next five years, we propose to: (1) apply these methods to acquire a high temporal
density map of human iPSC trilineage differentiation into cardiomyocyte, hepatocyte, and neuroprogenitor cells;
(2) interrogate the regulatory principles that govern turnover flux across different differentiation stages; and (3)
assess the functional consequences of protein degradation on the success and cell maturity of terminal cell
production. Finally, a limitation of current techniques is that the kinetic models used in protein turnover studies
largely assume a non-changing protein pool size at steady state, which does not apply to differentiating cells
or progressing diseases. We propose to expand current models of analyzing heavy water stable isotope label
experiments toward dynamical systems with variable protein pool sizes. If successful, the proposed research
would greatly expand the current knowledge of molecular events that take place during human iPSC
differentiation, as well as generate publicly available data sets and software tools to advance protein turnover
studies in diverse areas."

 Mortality due to cirrhosis in the United States is increasing, driven by alcohol-associated liver disease
(ALD). There is currently no specific pharmacotherapy that affects outcomes of ALD beyond short-term
mortality, so new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Platelets and intrahepatic microvascular thrombosis
are increasingly recognized as key drivers of crucial biological processes within the liver, including liver
fibrosis, portal hypertension, acute liver injury, and liver regeneration, in a highly context-specific manner.
However, our current understanding of the mechanistic role of platelets in liver disease is greatly limited, as
evidenced by the contradictory results of published studies. Platelets interact closely with liver endothelial cells
to coordinate inflammation within the liver, and proinflammatory liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play
a critical role in liver inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to its effects on the liver, alcohol also has direct
pathological effects on the bone marrow and platelets themselves. The goal of this study is to define the role of
platelets in the pathogenesis of ALD.
 We have three aims for the proposed research: 1) Define the mechanism of platelet dysfunction in
alcohol-associated hepatitis; 2) Define the pathological effect of platelets in alcohol-associated hepatitis on
LSECs; 3) Determine the pathological role of platelets and platelet-derived microparticles in alcohol-associated
hepatitis in vivo. Our studies will begin in patients, defining specific molecular mechanisms of platelet
dysfunction in alcohol-associated hepatitis using a biochemical, imaging, and bioinformatics approach. We will
then utilize patient samples to determine mechanisms of pathological platelet-LSEC communication resulting in
endothelial inflammation. Finally, we will utilize a preclinical model of alcohol-associated hepatitis to determine
the therapeutic effect of blocking specific mechanisms of platelet-endothelial interaction in vivo
 This project will be conducted with the guidance and mentorship of Dr. Yasuko Iwakiri, an expert in liver
vascular biology, and with co-mentorship by Dr. John Hwa, an expert in platelet biology. The project will take
full advantage of the significant material, clinical, and educational resources available within the Yale Liver
Center and Yale University. The goal of this project is to illuminate a new paradigm of pathogenesis in alcohol-
associated liver disease, forming the basis of an independent research career."
10894212,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Two-thirds of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) first misuse opioids before age 25. Intervention early
in the life course is critical, and requires that adolescents and young adults (hereafter, “youth”) receive high-
quality care in a continuum of care. Optimizing clinical care at every stage in this continuum is critical, and
cannot be achieved alongside persistent racial and ethnic disparities. To lay the groundwork for quality
improvement nationwide in Medicaid programs—the primary insurers for youth of color in the US—this project
will apply the Cascade of Care framework to OUD identification and treatment in youth. The Cascade
describes a series of 5 stages, i.e., how many youth with OUD (i) are identified (“diagnosis”), (ii) begin
treatment (“initiation”), (iii) start medications for opioid use disorder (“MOUD”), (iv) stay in treatment in the
short-term (“engagement”), and (v) stay in treatment in the long term (“retention”). Analyses will use newly
released Medicaid data from across US states linked to numerous national databases to provide key county-
and state-level information. The central objective is to provide a comprehensive picture of the Cascade for
youth aged 13-25 with OUD, throughout focusing on disparities. Specific Aims are to: (1) Apply the Cascade of
Care framework to youth with OUD and estimate racial and ethnic disparities at each stage, using a systematic
approach to uncover underlying, potentially intervenable mechanisms contributing to disparities; (2) Determine
whether MOUD receipt is associated with subsequent treatment engagement and retention, and with smaller
racial and ethnic disparities, thus informing whether MOUD might be a strategy to reduce inequities in OUD
treatment; and (3) Determine whether the Cascade is associated with emergency department use and
hospitalizations, thus identifying whether real-world clinical outcomes worsen when youth leave the Cascade,
and whether such outcomes are disproportionately experienced by youth of color. Throughout, race is
conceptualized as a social (not biological) construct, and the project seeks to identify ways that the operation
of healthcare systems and legal and regulatory climates contribute to health disparities, in order to ultimately
guide policy change. The research team brings together expertise in youth, OUD treatment, health disparities,
community engagement, health services research, and relevant statistical approaches. The project will be
guided by a diverse Youth and Family Advisory Board to inform protocol development, analysis, interpretation,
and dissemination of findings, with a goal of maximizing relevance and delivery of results to youth and families,
as well as key stakeholders nationally."
10894214,"Sequence count data (e.g., 16S rRNA sequencing or single-cell RNA-seq) are ubiquitous in modern
biomedical research. Yet even in the absence of measurement noise and limitations of experimental
design, these data convey limited information about the underlying biological system being measured.
Beyond familiar limitations such as inappropriate study design, two other forms of limitations have been
shown to impact or even dominate study conclusions. Scale limitations arise because the scale of the
system under study (e.g., the total number of bacteria in a persons gut) is typically independent of the scale
of the data. In contrast, measurement bias skews the observed distribution of counts as some entities are
systematically underrepresented compared to others. Despite an appreciation of these problems, we lack
tools for performing and evaluating analyses of sequence count data in light of these limitations. Here we
develop new statistical theory and tools for addressing measurement bias and scale limitations. This
proposal has 3 aims. (1) Develop a theoretical framework for objectively evaluating existing approaches in
light of these limitations. (2) Develop Simulated Inference as a new theoretical and computational
framework which allows analysts to use their preferred models and software while incorporating uncertainty
stemming from these data limitations. (3) Validate these tools through application to three case-studies of
real sequence count data. In total, these aims provide new theoretical and computational tools for
evaluating and performing analyses of sequence count data that are robust to these data limitations. The
proposed work is also a substantial departure from the status quo. In contrast to existing methods which
address these data limitations through assumptions that are often implicit, we develop statistical theory and
tools that explicitly model uncertainty and potential error in those assumptions. We demonstrate that this
approach can lead to lower Type-I and Type-II errors both in theory and in practice. Overall these tools will
enhance the reproducibility and rigor of sequence count data analysis which is central to projects across
the NIH."
10894081,"Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) is an atypical GST isoform that is overexpressed in several cancers
and has been implicated in drug resistance. Currently, no small-molecule drug targeting GSTO1 is under clinical
development. Using genetic tools, including extensive bioinformatics analysis coupled with siRNA, shRNA,
proteomics, and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies; and pharmacologic small-molecule inhibitors and degraders, we
have validated GSTO1 as an impactful druggable target in oncology. Previously, we identified C1-27 as a potent
GSTO1 inhibitor that shows efficacy against cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo models. We also synthesized
and tested the very first GSTO1 PROTAC confirming GSTO1 degradation in vitro. Through transcriptional
profiling using Bru-seq and RNA-seq coupled with proteomics, we uncovered novel pharmacodynamic markers
and cellular pathways critical for oncogenesis regulated by GSTO1. Taken together, our findings validate GSTO1
as an important drug target for cancer therapeutics and C1-27 as a potent and validated prototype inhibitor.
Previously, we solved the crystal structure of C1-27 (IC50 = 31 nM) and other potent inhibitors in complex with
GSTO1. Our most recent lead optimization campaign using 6 different co-crystal structures resulted in the most
potent GSTO1 inhibitor (IC50 = 0.22 ± 0.02 nM) known to date. Our CRISPR/Cas9 GSTO1 knockout (KO) cell
lines do not form tumors or display tumor growth delay in vivo and form smaller 3D spheroids in vitro. Through
multi-omics studies in GSTO1 KO cells, we found a strong positive correlation with cell adhesion molecules and
interferon response pathways, and a strong negative correlation with Myc transcriptional signature. Importantly,
we also identified several clinically used chemotherapies showing significant synthetic lethality with loss or
inhibition of GSTO1. We discovered that tissue factor (gene name, F3) transcription and protein expression are
downregulated in response to GSTO1 KO and C1-27 treatment, further implicating a role for GSTO1 in the innate
immune response. In summary, our results implicate GSTO1 as a therapeutic target in cancer and offer new
mechanistic insights into its significant role in cancer progression. Importantly, our results show for the first time
that inhibition of GSTO1 can activate immune responses and downregulate F3. We hypothesize that inhibiting
GSTO1 will have a two-pronged effect on tumor cells: (A) impair cancer cell survival by reducing Myc
transcriptional signature and F3 downregulation, and (B) enhance immune responses through interferon-
mediated innate immune sensing of cancers. We further hypothesize that GSTO1 inhibitors will sensitize cancer
cells to select chemotherapy and immunotherapy. We will test these hypotheses through the following three
specific aims. Aim 1: Elucidate the functions of GSTO1 in enhancing immune response through activation of
type-I interferon and reducing tumor cell viability through F3 and Myc downregulation. Aim 2: Optimize GSTO1
degraders based on co-crystal structures to select a clinical candidate. Aim 3: Assess in vivo efficacy of promising
novel GSTO1 degraders in PDX and syngeneic models of CRC as single agents and in combination."

African Americans remain disproportionately burdened by tobacco, experiencing among the highest rates of
tobacco-attributable disease. Approximately 85% of African American adults who smoke use menthol
cigarettes. Which contribute to persistent tobacco use. African Americans and many groups of menthol users
experience excessive socioeconomic disadvantage; individuals with socioeconomic disadvantage are at
greater risk for smoking and less likely to stop. Addressing unmet social needs may offer a critical inroad to
supporting smoking abstinence. Evidence suggests addressing unmet needs can improve healthcare
outcomes, yet the impact of addressing unmet social needs within the context of tobacco treatment has not
been established. This revision application will exist within our ongoing parent study, the Kick It at Swope (KIS-
V) clinical trial, evaluating extended pharmacotherapy in 500 African American daily smokers (expecting 425
menthol and 75 non-menthol users), with the goal of increasing treatment efficacy. The objective of this
revision application is to characterize unmet social needs of African American menthol users by assessing
community-level neighborhood disadvantage and individual-level social needs and persistence or resolution of
those needs among 300 participants (255 menthol, 55 non-menthol), estimating over 200 enrolled prior to the
start of this revision and 100 enrolled within the first five months of this award. Our specific aims are to
evaluate individual-level social vulnerability and community-level social disadvantage among African American
menthol smokers, and to assess and describe the resolution of participant needs during the 6 months of
tobacco use treatment. These aims will be completed during the one-year of this award. The infrastructure put
in place will further support the long-term aim of evaluating community-level disadvantage, individual
vulnerability and social need, and resolution of needs in relation to smoking abstinence following treatment
following completion of the parent trial. Importantly, these findings from one of the largest samples of menthol
smokers within a clinical trial will produce strong evidence to inform individual- and system-level approaches to
enhancing treatment of menthol smokers. Findings will advance our understanding of the interrelationship of
key socioecological factors to smoking abstinence within treatment and will inform intervention for
socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. Supporting long-term abstinence would have major impact on
reducing tobacco-related disparities, morbidity, and mortality."

The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is
challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in
adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics
patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this
proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning
models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high-
throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by
a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central
hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to
chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting
drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by
learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells.
Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts.
The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance
pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays.
Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to
an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics
studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of
pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a
successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned
leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an
outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics
analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader
in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator),
an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant
expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the
candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad
connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate
to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics."

members of underrepresented groups will be actively recruited through targeted national outreach. Each intern
will receive a full fellowship including subsistence, round-trip transportation, research supplies, and funds to
offset the cost of housing. These funds will enable economically disadvantaged students to forgo summer jobs
and participate in this life-changing educational experience. (3) Encourage careers in science and lifelong
scientific literacy. Each participant will join a sponsoring scientist's team and will design and conduct an
independent, hypothesis-driven project using advanced analytic methods and tools and the outstanding scientific
resources available at JAX-GM. The cancer research fellowship program will require students to attend
workshops on the ethical, legal, and social issues facing scientists today and complete pre-fellowship online
prequels on cancer genomics. (4) Incorporate evaluation to strengthen the program. JAX Genomic
Education staff will collect formative and summative evaluation data that will directly inform program leadership
to guide future administration of the program. The JAX institutional commitment ensures student access to
intellectual and research resources including on-campus courses and conferences, state-of-the-art
instrumentation and computational resources, dedicated program direction by JAX Genomic Education staff,
housing in a college setting, and a professionally staffed residential program. The SSP––supported by
institutional funds, private foundations, and federal grants––has well-established administrative procedures for
recruitment and selection, mentor training, guidance, program design, management, and evaluation. JAX-GM
offers a stimulating environment in which motivated, talented students from diverse backgrounds can learn the
fundamentals of scientific inquiry, contribute to real research progress, and make great strides in intellectual and

 Our overarching goal is to investigate the impact of early life immune response to a broad array of
pathogenic and commensal microbes and exposure to multiple environmental pollutants on the development
and prognosis of allergic diseases from birth up to age 18 years and their underlying molecular pathways. Our
project is motivated by growing evidence that in-utero and the first few years of life are critical windows for the
development of immunity, and by observations that early life exposures to microbes and environmental
pollutants may have a profound impact on future risk of allergic diseases. To achieve our goal, we will leverage
the rich resources of the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC), with ~3,500 mother-child pairs who were enrolled at birth
and followed prospectively. Through our prior research in the BBC, we have established essential clinical,
laboratory and computational infrastructures, and obtained longitudinal epidemiological and clinical data, and
multi-omics (genome, epigenome, metabolome) data as well as archived biospecimens. We have shown that
the BBC is a high-risk population for adverse environmental exposures and the children of the BBC have a
high prevalence of immune-related disorders, including food allergies, early childhood recurrent wheezing and
childhood asthma. The breadth, depth, and high quality of the BBC data and biorepository have been
demonstrated in over 120 peer-reviewed publications. We also have generated compelling preliminary data to
support our study aims and hypotheses. Specifically, by including 1,000 mother-child dyads of the BBC with
key longitudinal data elements and biospecimens from birth up to age 18 years, we aim to investigate: (1)
effects of early life immune response to microbes on child allergic phenotypes; (2) effects of early life exposure
to environmental pollutants (e.g., air pollution, toxic metals) on child allergic phenotypes; and (3) molecular
pathways underlying the link between early life environmental exposures and allergic diseases. We will
harness cutting-edge antibody profiling technology (PhIP-Seq) to profile IgG and IgE antibodies in 1,000 BBC
children at three important developmental windows (birth, 1-2 years, and 15-18 years). This will provide deep
phenotyping of a child’s antibody profile and identify longitudinal changes in the context of prenatal, perinatal,
and postnatal genetic and environmental interactions. Our ability to profile the antibody repertoire and define
allergic phenotypes across critical developmental windows allow us to delineate their longitudinal trajectories,
temporal and dose-response relationships between the exposures and outcomes. Successful completion of
this study will help identify important early life risk and protective factors, along with novel biomarkers for
prediction or therapeutic targets. Ultimately, we hope that high-risk newborns can be identified, and effective
interventions can be initiated during the earliest developmental windows when they may have the greatest life-
long benefit."

The desire to tie aspects of fundamental cell biology, the mechanisms of disease propagation, and clinical

extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from all cell types within the body, which are now realized as key agents in
intracellular communication. They exhibit protein biomarkers from their cells of origin, making them promising
candidates for use in disease diagnostics. Likewise, much interest lies in the potential use of exosomes as
drug delivery vehicles (i.e., vectors). However, a great deal of fundamental research is necessary before the
utility of exosomes is fully realized. A crucial challenge in the application of exosome-based research and
application lies in the lack of robust and versatile methods for vesicle isolation from diverse biological media.
While isolation and quantification methods have evolved, none have overcome the key issues associated with
rigor and reproducibility to cleanly, quickly, and cost-effectively isolate exosomes. To address this void, an
extremely efficient platform technology for exosome capture and isolation, based on novel poly(ethylene-
terephthalate) (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers and films, is being developed for applications
across the scales of relevance for basic research, clinical diagnostics, and preparative recovery. Initial results
show that the fibers can effectively isolate extracellular vesicles, enriched in exosomes, with size distributions
and yields comparable to traditional isolation methods, in much shorter times, smaller volume scales, and
higher purity. Proposed here is the further development and validation of this exosome isolation methodology

the fibers in spin-down tip format provides greater versatility towards generic- and targeted-exosome
harvesting using common, bench-top centrifuges. In the third, C-CP fiber films can be configured to affect a
high-efficiency, multiplexed lateral flow immunoassay for clinical diagnostics. It is fully believed that the results
of this program will demonstrate that novel C-CP fiber/film isolation platforms will prove to be an efficient, cost-

People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with an insidious clinical decline independent of
inflammatory disease activity (progression) often have a greater extent of spinal cord (SC)
involvement. There is a critical need to understand how injury of clinically eloquent SC motor
and sensory tracts can lead to variable functional impairment ranging from being asymptomatic
to a bedridden state. Strong correlations between disability worsening and a progressive
disease course have been observed with 1) focal atrophy with some lateral SC lesions and 2)
upper cervical SC atrophy reflecting global SC lesion burden. These findings suggest that
axonal loss is a key driver of disability and is variably lost as a consequence of lesions. In
postmortem tissue, we determined that T2*-weighted intensity can be used to discriminate
demyelinated hyperintense lesions from myelinated lesions (intermediate hyperintensity).
Approximately a third of T2* lesions were intermediate intensity characterized by swollen
dystrophic axons with thinner myelin and activated/phagocytic microglia/macrophages. This led
to our hypothesis that intermediate lesions represent secondary neurodegenerative changes
(Wallerian degeneration) distal to a demyelinated lesion. Our aims determine whether 1)
intermediate lesions can be detected distinctly from hyperintense lesions in vivo and whether
they are distal to hyperintense lesions using 7T MRI; and 2) differences in detection of
intermediate lesions between 7T and 3T. We are particularly well positioned to perform this work
as we have demonstrated T2* can be thresholded to discriminate between lesion subtypes by
MRI-pathology and have similar sequences already available in a pre-existing 3T MRI dataset
and prospectively on 7T. The 52% improved detection of 7T lesions compared to 3T and our
ability to pre-screen PwMS with known focal cervical SC lesions at our Center, will optimize the
potential for successful execution of our aims. Ultimately, the data generated from this proposal
will identify the ability of 7T and 3T to detect potential neurodegenerative changes distal to
demyelination to ask what patient characteristics lead to a greater likelihood of Wallerian
degeneration (intermediate lesions) or axonal loss (atrophy) and whether therapeutic
interventions can prevent these processes."

Housing is a critical social determinant of health and key contributor to racial/ethnic health disparities in the US.
In the context of rising housing costs, a recent recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic, experiences with
housing instability such as foreclosure, eviction, and homelessness are a serious and growing public health
concern. Black and Latino households are at an elevated risk of encountering these adverse housing
transitions compared with their White counterparts. Moreover, the subsequent exposures to heightened
psychosocial stress and financial strain have been shown to be particularly detrimental to Black and Latino
physical and mental health. Despite policy efforts to increase homeownership among Black and Latino
households, homeownership gaps remain large and have been widening. And given that homeowners are
more advantaged than renters, including having access to own household wealth and wealthier kin networks,
owners may be better equipped to sustain spells of housing instability over time and should be integral to
understanding how health disparities manifest later in life. Yet, we know little about the long-term health
consequences of housing instability, and how these stressful experiences contribute to racial/ethnic disparities
in late-life health. In addition, much of what is known about wealth and late-life health rests upon research
limited to Black-White comparisons, as well as work that has not considered the roles of extended kin financial
resources and adverse housing transitions. To remedy these issues, this project will leverage nationally
representative longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to evaluate a theoretical
model of housing instability and late-life health among Black, Latino, and White households. The unique
features of the PSID allow us to: (1) estimate the effects of housing instability on late-life health, and whether
the effects vary by racial/ethnic group and housing tenure; (2) determine whether racial/ethnic disparities in
exposure to housing instability mediate racial/ethnic health disparities later in life; and (3) determine whether
extended-family wealth moderates the effects of housing instability on late-life health, and whether the health
effects vary by racial/ethnic group and housing tenure. This project will complete these three aims using a
counterfactual framework that produces robust causal estimates of housing instability over time on late-life
health outcomes, including cognitive functioning, psychological distress, self-rated health, and functional
limitations. Estimates will come from marginal structural models with inverse-probability-treatment weights,
which will allow for time-varying confounders that overcome challenges facing conventional regression
techniques (e.g., selection bias, reverse causality)—a key innovation of this project."

Trained immunity describes the relatively new observation that exposure to inflammation alters the
innate immune cells, monocytes and neutrophils, to alter their behavior such that they respond to a
second stimuli with more efficiency. This process is akin to the immunologic memory of the adaptive
immune system. Initially observed in response to pathogens and vaccination, it is now increasingly
clear that sterile, chronic inflammation leads to systemic reprogramming of macrophages. While
developed to improve efficiency of pathogen clearance, this mechanism comes at the cost of promoting
cardiovascular disease. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common, chronic autoimmune disease, carries
the burden of premature mortality to cardiovascular disease. No studies have directly tested whether
inflammatory RA induces trained immune responses in innate cells of the arthritic joint or in the aortic
wall. This proposal hypothesizes that trained immunity occurs in response to RA in the macrophages
of the joint and in the bone marrow. Additionally, we propose that this training of the innate immune
system causes the macrophages of the aorta to become pro-atherogenic, and thus promote
development of atherosclerosis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that trained immunity
is a novel cause behind the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in RA patients, and proposes
to test this hypothesis using murine models. The PI is a K01 awardee in her 4th year of funding and will
use these pilot studies to pursue her long term research goal to pursue mechanisms linking RA and
cardiovascular disease. Indeed, these studies will provide the pilot data necessary to pursue
independent R01 funding exploring the links between inflammatory arthritis, trained immunity, and
cardiovascular disease."

The peripartum period is a time of dramatic neurobiological change, but these changes are not well understood
across time. The peripartum period is also marked with high rates of depression. As such, the proposed
research project aims to characterize brain changes prospectively across pregnancy to better understand the
implications of neurobiological changes on mental health. Our multidisciplinary team has the necessary
expertise (developmental neuroscience, peripartum mental health, imaging science, bioethics, and maternal–
fetal medicine) to safely conduct an advanced neuroimaging study with this understudied population. Our team
members have worked together to administer repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with multiple
scan modalities to examine within- and between-person alterations in brain structure and function during this
period of neurobiological change. Data from our preliminary studies scanning pregnant people longitudinally
provide the foundation for this innovative project. In 100 pregnant individuals we will use advanced multimodal
MRI (structural, diffusion, and functional MRI) to study brain changes across 9 months of pregnancy using an
accelerated longitudinal design with planned missingness so that each participant contributes only 4 scans
across their pregnancy. First, we aim to characterize changes in brain structure and function across
pregnancy, including the magnitude and pattern of change in various brain volume metrics, white matter
microstructure, and functional connectivity (Aim 1). Preliminary data suggests a .41% decrease in total brain
volume per week during pregnancy, as well as decreases in cortical volume, gray matter, and cortical
thickness. Second, we aim to investigate hormonal changes (cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and
testosterone) underlying alterations in brain structure and function (Aim 2). Our preliminary data suggest that
increases in progesterone level partially explain reductions in gray matter volume, while surges in
progesterone and estradiol levels may be linked to increased white matter microstructure. Third, we aim to
examine the potential functional consequences of brain changes (Aim 3). To explore the potential functional
consequences of changes in brain structure and function, we will collect EEG data in response to reward and
threat, assess self-reported negative affect, and evaluate cognitive function using the NIH toolbox. Participants
will also report on peripartum depressive symptoms at each assessment wave and again at 8 weeks
postpartum. The project's innovative planned missingness design will provide unprecedented insights into the
neurobiological changes that occur across the full course of pregnancy without overburdening participants. By
filling the knowledge gap regarding brain changes during pregnancy, the findings will set the foundation for
translational work given the impact peripartum depression has on individuals and their families."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in children worldwide and has a substantial
detrimental impact on patients’ quality of life. Staphylococcus aureus is known to contribute to AD pathogenesis
and is also found at high rates in the gut of infants. However, the contribution of gastrointestinal (GI)-colonizing
S. aureus to AD, remains largely unexplored. In this proposal, we will determine whether and how S. aureus in
concert with other microbiota from the GI tract, contributes to AD. Our preliminary data suggest an association
of S. aureus rectal colonization, a surrogate measure for GI colonization, with pediatric AD. Further, within hosts,
S. aureus colonization density in the rectum correlates with AD flare and remission, mirroring cutaneous
colonization. Comparative genomic analysis of S. aureus isolates from the nares, lesional skin, and rectum in an
AD subject demonstrates identical mutations shared exclusively between rectal and cutaneous S. aureus,
providing evidence of transmission from gut to skin. Several of these mutations were observed within the agr
locus, a regulator of virulence thought to promote AD, but only in combination with wild-type agr strains. This
observation of both wild-type S. aureus and isolates with mutations in this important gene regulator suggests
evolutionary pressures may have selected for the cooperative effects of these mixed S. aureus populations. We
will test whether the GI tract is a source of cutaneous S. aureus in AD using advanced sequencing techniques
to perform comparative genomic analysis on S. aureus isolates from human subjects (Aim 1). We will further
characterize the effects of other gut microbiota on S. aureus GI and cutaneous colonization and, by
consequence, on AD (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether cooperative effects of agr wild-type and mutant
variants contribute to S. aureus colonization fitness and AD in GI and skin colonization mouse models (Aim 3).
Our central hypothesis is that GI-colonizing S. aureus contributes to AD through interactions with other gut
microbiota and effects on cutaneous S. aureus colonization. These effects may be mediated by the mixed
populations of S. aureus present in the GI reservoir. The rationale for this research is that improved
understanding of the colonization dynamics of S. aureus beyond the nares and skin in AD will allow for improved
therapeutic strategies targeting the microbiome in AD. To achieve these aims, I will be supported by my primary
mentor, Dr. Bo Shopsin (NYU), a scientific leader in the study of S. aureus molecular epidemiology and
translation of genetic features in bacterial field isolates to relevant clinical phenotypes. Dr. Shopsin’s guidance
will be complemented by a committee of investigators with expertise in cutaneous biology, microbiome analysis,
and physician-scientist training. This proposal includes training in microbiology, sequencing techniques, in vivo
models, and coursework in advanced genomic and microbiome analysis. NYU offers outstanding faculty with
well-supported core facilities to provide an optimal environment to support my transition to an independent
investigator studying the impact of microbes on skin health."
10868661,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Two million Healthcare Associated Infections (HAIs) occur per year in the US, killing >90,000 patients and
costing ~$50-100 billion (adjusted by CPI to 2020 dollars). HAIs are the 6th leading cause of death in the US,
ahead of diabetes and kidney disease. Reducing HAIs is a top priority of the US Department of Health and
Human Services1 and experts have called for novel strategies including vaccination to achieve this goal.2
 ExBaq is a biotechnology company founded by a consortium of scientists and business colleagues who
have spent years studying antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens. ExBaq is developing a vaccine to
prevent HAIs comprised of innate-immune stimulatory molecules that provide broad-spectrum protection
against infection caused by cross-kingdom HAI pathogens (preliminary data). Our vaccine consists of:
 A) Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3), which is contained in multiple FDA-approved vaccines, and
 enhances immunity via multiple mechanisms, including induction of depot formation, activating the
 NALP3 inflammasome, and enhancing particulate uptake by macrophages;
 B) Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL), which is also contained (in combination with Al(OH)3) in multiple
 FDA-approved vaccines and activates the NF-κB pathway via TLR4 ligation;
 C) Mannan, which stimulates a variety of innate and adaptive immune pathways, and was safe in
 clinical trials when administered parenterally.
 During Phase I we have confirmed that this triple adjuvant regimen has the broadest protection against
pathogens, affording lower doses (important for cost of goods), compared to a triple regimen containing whole
glucan particles instead of mannan, or with a quadruple regimen (preliminary data). Efficacy of the triple
regimen has been confirmed in lethal mouse models of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and
Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and disseminated infection
caused by the fungi Candida albicans and Rhizopus delamar (mucormycosis). Given efficacy against Gram-
positive and -negative bacteria and fungal pathogens, our trivalent vaccine has potential to prevent
HAIs caused by the highest priority, antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens. Having established an
optimal lead composition in Phase I, the goal of Phase II is to establish GMP, conduct pre-clinical immuno-
toxicology studies, and to complete key steps to supporting IND submission. Our Aims are to:
AIM 1: Establish GMP manufacturing for our vaccine regimen.
AIM 2: To complete pre-clinical immuno-toxicity studies to support an IND application.
AIM 3: Complete key steps to support IND-filing at end of funding."
10865502,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infertility affects about 15% of couples. Ovulatory dysfunction is a primary cause with unclear etiology. Studies
have found that certain chemicals are reproductive toxicants and impair female fertility. However, these studies
are limited to a small number of known environmental chemicals, and there are major gaps in understanding of
the impacts of simultaneous exposures to thousands of chemicals (i.e., the exposome) on ovarian function and
female fertility. Thus, there is a critical need to evaluate how complex chemical exposures target reproductive
organs, to determine potential biologic pathways of action, and to identify important sources of exposures and
their racial/ethnic disparities to inform opportunities for intervention. Research Aims: The proposed research
leverages an exposomics approach to evaluate associations between personal care product (PCP) use,
chemical exposure biomarkers, ovarian health biomarkers, and female fertility outcomes. Untargeted high-
resolution mass spectrometry will measure up to 100,000 chemicals and endogenous metabolites in samples
of blood or follicular fluid surrounding developing oocytes. Aim 1 will use machine learning to develop a
generalizable database of signatures in the blood exposome that identify PCP habits, based on 4,188 women
in the Sister Study. This will create a key resource for other ‘omics health studies to retrospectively assess
PCP exposures in banked biologic samples. The PCP signatures can also be used to underpin interpretations
of the chemical exposome in Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will evaluate associations between the chemical exposome
in follicular fluid and fertility (e.g., oocyte yield, clinical pregnancy, and live birth) among 70 women undergoing
assisted reproduction technology (ART) from the EMPOWR cohort in Atlanta. Follicular fluid metabolomics will
provide mechanistic insights into biologic pathways underlying associations between exposure and outcome.
With the racial/ethnic diversity of the cohorts in Aims 1–2, we will also investigate disparities in exposure, PCP
signatures, and fertility. Aim 3 will leverage a third cohort of ~250 women in the EARTH study undergoing ART
in Massachusetts and will determine associations of PCP habits and the blood and follicular fluid exposomes
with fertility, while also providing an independent cohort for evaluating shared biological effects identified in Aim
2. Career Goals: Dr. Anna Young’s background includes strong, cross-disciplinary training in environmental
epidemiology, chemical exposure assessment, and computer science. This K99/R00 award will provide critical
development of expertise in exposomics, applied data science, and reproductive epidemiology to position her
for a high-impact independent research career studying the impact of the exposome on understudied female
reproductive disorders. Dr. Young’s training will consist of courses, conferences, seminars, and hands-on
mentoring from an exceptional multi-disciplinary team: Drs. Douglas Walker (primary mentor), Audrey Gaskins
(co-mentor), Russ Hauser, Chris Gennings, Shruthi Mahalingaiah, Alexandra White, and Christine Ekenga."
10865658,"Project Summary
This proposal aims to determine how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is regulated in neurons at rest and during
neuronal activity. The ER is a contiguous membrane-bound compartment, which forms a network of tubules that
extends to the periphery of neurons and forms contacts with other organelles, controlling processes such as lipid
transfer, organelle scission, and calcium signaling. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), often have mutations in genes that disrupt ER structure and ER contacts.
However, our understanding of ER function in neurons primarily comes from studies of non-neuronal cells. The
complex morphologies and elongated structures of neurons impose unique challenges for secretory and
endosomal membrane trafficking pathways. In particular, endosomes are vital for conveying long-distance
signals within neurons and packaging cargoes for intercellular signaling through extracellular vesicles. We
currently know very little about how ER contacts regulate neuronal endosomal compartments, or how the
structure of the neuronal ER is modified by activity. This project will use Drosophila and mammalian neuronal
systems to examine ER-endosome contacts in neurons and to study how neuronal activity regulates the ER.
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction is an excellent system to study the ER because it is genetically tractable,
and easily accessible for live imaging and electrophysiology. On the other hand, mammalian neuronal cultures
provide homogeneous material for biochemical studies, and can show if findings in Drosophila are evolutionarily
conserved. First, this proposal will determine how the HSP-linked gene Atlastin, which controls the assembly of
the ER into a reticular network, affects ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila and mammalian neurons (Aim1a,c).
Atlastin mutant synapses will be examined to uncover the mechanistic basis of the observed structural and
dynamic defects in the ER, as well as the accumulation of endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes (Aim1b).
Next, this study will examine how different neuronal activity paradigms (e.g. spontaneous vs. mild vs strong
stimulation) regulate the dynamics of the ER and ER-endosome contacts in Drosophila (Aim2a). Finally,
proximity labeling approaches will also be used in hippocampal neurons to identify candidate proteins at ER
contacts that are regulated by neuronal activity, to lay the foundation for future functional studies in Drosophila
(Aim2b). To achieve these research goals, the proposed training plan will expand the PI’s experimental skillsets
in various microscopy techniques, construction of genetic sensors, mammalian neuronal culture, and new coding
skills for image analysis such as image restoration and particle tracking. The career development plan focuses
on strengthening the PI's publication record, transitioning to an independent research position, and promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusion in science. Overall, the MOSAIC K99/R00 will allow the PI to gain necessary skills
to become an independent researcher in the field of neuronal cell biology and membrane trafficking."

Inhibition of the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) improves prognosis in a mouse model of Leigh
Syndrome (LS) and in a small cohort of Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke
(MELAS) patients, two neurological mitochondrial disorders. However, its specific mechanism of action
remains to be determined. We find that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reverses metabolic alterations in LS
mice lacking the Complex I subunit Ndufs4 (Ndufs4-/-): more specifically, rapamycin reduces the accumulation
of glycolytic intermediates and increases the abundance of fatty acids in both brain and liver of Ndufs4-/- mice.
Loss of the mitochondrial sirtuin Sirt3 abrogates lifespan extension and the delay of neurological phenotypes in
Ndufs4-/- mice treated with rapamycin. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we explore the dependency of mTOR
inhibition on Sirt3 to improve disease phenotypes in these animals. Specifically, we hypothesize that
expression of Sirt3 in the liver is required to promote the metabolic shift to fatty acid oxidation described above.
Treatment with the Nucleoside Analog Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV) delays
symptoms of disease and improves survival in Ndufs4-/- mice. ADV increases the expression of C/EBP-β, a
transcription factor that increases hepatic fatty acid oxidation in response to calorie restriction and mTOR
inhibition. In Aim 2 we explore the hypothesis that C/EBP-β guides the metabolic shift induced by rapamycin in
Ndufs4-/- mice.
With a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches, both aims will determine the exact nature of
the metabolic alterations induced by loss of Complex I, the mechanisms by which this loss of metabolic
homeostasis is rescued, and its importance in the etiology and progression of neurological mitochondrial
disease. This project will determine the metabolic nature of these disorders and lay the foundation for novel
treatments based on fine tuning of nutrient metabolism in patients affected by Complex I dysfunction."

for training and research activities that will provide critical skills and experience I need to become an
independent investigator with expertise in prognostic research for post-discharge mortality (PDM) among
young children in sub-Saharan Africa. I am an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine at
Emory University School of Medicine, an attending physician at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and a
pediatric research scientist in the Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network. My
K23 training goals are to develop 1) proficiency in advanced methods in prognostic research, risk assessment
tool evaluation, and large data analysis for PDM clinical prediction modeling in sub-Saharan Africa, 2)
expertise in biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction for PDM, and 3) advanced experience in collaborative global
health research. To achieve these goals, I have constructed an expert, multidisciplinary team of mentors,
advisors, and collaborators. My co-primary mentors are Claudia R. Morris, MD and Cynthia G. Whitney, MD,
MPH. Dr. Morris is a Professor of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine
and an expert in the role of arginine dysregulation in endothelial dysfunction. Dr. Whitney is a Professor of
Global Health at Emory Rollins School of Public Health, the PI of CHAMPS, and an expert in childhood
mortality surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. My mentor Rishikesan Kamaleswaran, PhD, MSc is an Associate
Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Emory and will mentor me through the development machine learning
risk assessment tools for PDM. PDM rates among young children in sub-Saharan Africa are 3-18% within
months of hospital discharge, far outpacing the 0.1% rate we described in US children. Despite this immense
disparity, there are no implemented risk assessment tools to identify young children at risk for PDM. The
studies proposed here are designed to test the hypotheses that a machine learning approach to identifying
young children at risk for PDM in Tanzania and Liberia will have greater discriminatory value than logistic
regression models, that our risk assessment tools developed in Tanzania and Liberia will accurately identify
young children in Kenya at risk for PDM, and that a key biomarker of endothelial dysfunction (i.e., the global
arginine bioavailability ratio) will be lower in children who die after hospital discharge than those who survive. I
will use the many resources at Emory University School of Medicine, Emory Rollins School of Public Health,
the CHAMPS network, and the Kenya Medical Research Institute to add these studies to the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation supported CHAMPS platform with a focus on the identification of young children at risk for
PDM. These studies, the proposed coursework, and didactics will give me the training, skills, and experience
needed to develop into an independent investigator equipped to conduct future research to reduce PDM."
10865874,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions worldwide, 100,000 individuals in USA, and nearly 1000
children in UAB. Sickle cell anemia (SCA, HbSS or HbSB0 thalassemia) is the most severe form of SCD
and is associated with morbidity, mortality, and health care burden. Acute pain is the hallmark
complication for SCA, and inflammation is a driver of pain. Opioids are used to treat acute pain but lead
to adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, non-opioid therapies are desperately needed.
 Recent data and my preliminary data suggest gut microbial dysbiosis is present in SCD. My data
also suggests that a different microbiota profile is present in children with SCA pain. Therefore, dietary
interventions manipulating the gut microbiome represent a novel therapy for treating SCA pain. Marine
based ω3FA (fish oil) decreases pain in children with SCA but its acceptance is limited by its fishy odor
and taste. In contrast, plant-based ω 3FA (Flaxseed-FS) has a neutral taste and reduced pain in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis. My preliminary tasting trial identified that children with SCA accept FS added
products with over 80% of participants expressing a willingness to be contacted for this feasibility study.
Therefore, I am proposing a feasibility study of FS trial in children with SCA. My overarching hypothesis
is that FS enriched diet will be acceptable, impact the gut microbiome, decrease inflammation, and
reduce pain in children with SCA. The focus of this study is to recruit, retain and monitor for side
effects of a FS diet in children with SCA (Aim 1) while evaluating changes in gut microbiota profile (Aim
2) and improvement in inflammation driven pain outcomes (Aim 3) on this diet.
 The applicant has dedicated her career to becoming a physician scientist investigating
inexpensive, sustainable nutritional interventions that impact the microbiome and improve
inflammation driven outcomes in SCD. To fulfil this long-term goal, she moved to the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) where she has a supportive research environment in the Department of
Pediatrics and School of Medicine, including the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), Life
span sickle cell disease comprehensive research center, UAB microbiome center, the Immunology
Institute and the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center. She has assembled an excellent mentorship
team, and she plans to complement this mentorship in formal course work including advanced statistics,
clinical trials, metagenomics, nutrition, mucosal immunology, and pain psychology. This award will allow
her develop expertise in her identified training needs, acquire the skills to transition into a successful
independent physician scientist and grow into a leader in the field."
10865382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Membrane tension is thought to be a long-range integrator of cell physiology. During migration, membrane
tension has been proposed to enable cell polarity through front-back coordination and long-range protrusion
competition. These roles necessitate effective tension transmission across the cell. However, it remains a
source of significant debate as to whether cell membranes support or resist long-range membrane tension
propagation. I speculated that this this discrepancy likely originates from the use of exogenous forces that
may not accurately mimic endogenous forces. To overcome this complication, I used optogenetics to directly
control localized actin-based protrusions or actomyosin contractions while simultaneously monitoring the
propagation of membrane tension using dual-trap optical tweezers. My results led me to propose a unifying
model of tension propagation in which actin-driven protrusions and actomyosin contractions both elicit rapid
global membrane tension propagation, while forces applied to cell membranes alone do not. This work laid
the foundations of my ongoing studies and raises many important questions. For some processes, membrane
tension needs to act locally and in others, it needs to act at the range of the entire cell or multiple cells. What
controls the range and efficiency of tension propagation (Aim 1)? The cell has many processes that can
locally initiate changes in membrane tension (protrusions, contractions) and many cellular processes that are
regulated by tension changes. Are there important functional differences for how these cellular programs
transmit or receive membrane tension changes that may be important for cell polarity (Aim 2)? Migrating cells
often need to coordinate their movement with other cells in order to achieve collective or cooperative motion.
What is the impact of the membrane tension-polarity program in multicellular contexts such as encountered
during collective or cooperative cell migration (Aim 3)? I will answer these questions by using a combination
of optogenetics, force measurements, and advanced microscopy, and mathematical modeling. My research
will elucidate the interplay between membrane mechanics and polarity during cell migration and will provide
the foundation for my independent scientific niche of studying membrane mechanics during transendothelial
migration. Towards this goal, I am supplementing the input of my postdoc supervisor, Dr Weiner (expert on
cell polarity during migration) with a group of internationally recognized leaders at the interface of cell biology
and biophysics: Carlos Bustamante (optical traps), Herve Turlier (mechanical modelling), Janis Burkhardt
(cell migration). Japp van Buul and Ronen Alon, both experts on transendothelial migration. These scientists
will act as both advisors and collaborators, helping me establish my own scientific niche in understanding the
role of membrane mechanics in regulating transendothelial migration. I have worked with my mentor and
network of collaborators and advisors to develop my research plan and construct a tailored career
development program to help launch my independent career as a tenure-track principal investigator."
10865385,"Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) is a form of unpredictable neuropathic pain in Veterans with
amputation. Current non-medication treatments for PLP are limited and more
interventions are needed that take into consideration the unique needs of the Veteran
population. PLP significantly impairs rehabilitation outcomes and community
participation. One non-medication intervention is graded motor imagery (GMI). GMI
consists of sequentially progressing from limb laterality training, to motor imagery, and
then mirror therapy (i.e., observing movement using the visual illusion of an intact limb
in a mirror). Although clinicians report benefit from use of the technique, barriers exist to
supporting at-home use of the intervention. This VA Career Development Award-2
proposal focuses on refining a mobile app for GMI (VA-GMI) and then testing serial
sessions of mobile app use in a sample of Veterans with lower limb amputation and
moderate to severe PLP in their home setting.
We have a current working prototype of the VA-GMI mobile app. The project will initially
include serial cognitive interviews with 12 Veterans with lower limb amputation and PLP
as they trial the VA-GMI mobile app. Following each interview, we will compile the
themes and make iterative changes to improve the user interface and functionality of
the mobile app. We will then invite the Veterans to try the new version over the course
of a week and repeat the process. We anticipate that we can reach consensus on the
improvements to VA-GMI mobile app within 2 major iterations.
In years 2-5, we will conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
the intervention with 36 Veterans with amputation and moderate to severe PLP. We will
conduct this study virtually with all Veterans in their home environment. All Veterans will
receive twelve intervention sessions. To allow for real-time observation and assistance
with VA-GMI mobile app, we will use existing telehealth platforms to visualize and
interact with the Veteran. The primary outcome measure is the Acceptability of
Intervention Measure of the intervention sessions. We will measure process parameters
(e.g., number of eligible participants, recruitment rate, retention rate). We will also
objectively measure mobile app features (e.g., app usage, time spent on each screen
view, user interaction with app user interface (i.e., button clicks and usage details)). We
will explore the effect of VA-GMI mobile app on a number of domains hypothesized to
be impacted by the intervention to aid in our responder analysis. Several measures will
also be captured to characterize the population and inform outcome measurement
selection for future studies. Outcome measures will be collected at baseline, post-
intervention, 3-months, and 6-months from the baseline evaluation.
This Career Development Award-2 work supports the development and training for Dr.
Tonya Rich to become an independent VA researcher focused on the development and
testing of novel rehabilitation interventions for Veterans. With the support of the expert
mentor team in place, this work will incorporate Veteran input into the design of a novel
intervention with high translational value. This work will lead to future investigations of
optimized GMI intervention for the reduction of PLP in Veterans with amputations."
10865457,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rapid development of genome editing tools has outpaced the ability to deliver these molecules specifically
to diseased cells in human patients. A major bottleneck in expanding in vivo applications of genome editing is
the lack of targeted, cell-specific delivery vehicles. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on lipid nanoparticles or
adeno-associated viruses for delivery. Although these methods can broadly edit tissues in the lung, they lack
specificity for diseased cells and pose risks of off-target effects. The safe and effective use of CRISPR-Cas
enzymes as treatments for pulmonary and infectious diseases requires the development of cell-type specific
delivery vehicles in the lung.
In this proposal, we will engineer Enveloped Delivery Vehicles (EDVs) to deliver Cas9 ribonucleoproteins to lung
epithelial cells. We will target lung epithelial cells due to their involvement in pulmonary diseases such as
surfactant disorders. EDVs are bioengineered virus-like particles derived from lentivirus that package Cas9
proteins. We have previously shown that EDVs can specially edit T-cells in culture and in mice by displaying
antibodies on their surface.
Building on our laboratory’s expertise with virus-like particles and CRISPR-Cas9 mechanistic biology, we will
focus on determining the mechanisms of Cas9 packaging that will enable EDV targeting to lung epithelial cells.
Our first aim is to determine how EDVs encapsulate Cas9 and its guide RNA. Preliminary data from experiments
using chemical inhibitors and genetic deletions have begun to reveal which viral components of EDVs are
necessary to mediate genome editing. Non-essential components will be eliminated to optimize EDV design and
enhance editing efficiency. Concurrently, our second aim is to identify antibody fragments that facilitate the entry
of EDVs into lung epithelial cells. Antibody fragments displayed on the surface of EDVs will target epitopes
commonly utilized by respiratory viruses on epithelial cells. We will evaluate the ability of these antibodies to
mediate precise cell entry of EDVs and facilitate genome editing. These two aims are independent but
complementary. The outcomes of each will provide valuable insights into the internal and external design
elements necessary for targeting and editing lung epithelial cells.
While genome editing enzymes hold the potential to treat potentially all genetic diseases, strategies to deliver
these components beyond the liver and blood are needed to realize this potential for patients. We anticipate that
the mechanistic insights gained from this proposal will guide future efforts to target delivery vehicles to new cell
types of interest."
10868605,"We aim to uncover metabolic and protein signaling pathways contributing to the regional vulnerability of
neocortical pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer's disease and to identify novel targets for detection and
intervention. We will compare the prefrontal cortex, a neocortical brain area afflicted by neuropathology
early in Alzheimer's disease, with the primary visual cortex, a brain area that is relatively spared. We will
use mass spectrometric imaging in combination with segmentation analyses, to identify spatial changes
of small molecules and proteins in postmortem brain sections prepared from these neocortical areas from
donors at various clinical and pathological stages of Alzheimer's disease compared to controls. Then, we
will apply multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging on sequential sections from the same specimens, to
obtain information on cellular and microenvironment changes in and around vulnerable neocortical
neurons during disease progression, correlated with the clinical severity, degree and location of
neuropathological changes, and the risk genotype. Further, we will register the data from both imaging
techniques to identify metabolic pathways and protein signaling changes at the regional, laminar and
cellular level and to locate covariation in molecular and cellular phenotypes contributing to Alzheimer's
disease vulnerability. In addition to generating a comprehensive dataset of the cellular and molecular
changes at various stages of Alzheimer's disease, these studies will involve the development, validation,
and dissemination of novel tools for analysis of large datasets generated using two powerful imaging
tools, one that detects hundreds of analytes with the possibility of detecting previously unknown
contributors to disease and the other that provides higher resolution with a select set of known markers.
In the long term, the data generated from these studies could provide the basis for testing novel disease-
modifying treatments by cell-type specific targeting of identified metabolic pathways using experimental
models, such as brain organoids to replicate cortical lamination with human neurons or humanized mouse
chimeras to model interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cell types."

income children experience during the summer months by providing meals to children at program sites.
However, nutritional guidelines of the program are not as comprehensive as other nutrition assistance
programs, which may contribute to weight gain among children from low-income households who are
disproportionately affected by childhood obesity. Additionally, the program sites vary in operation length and
the extent to which there is additional healthy programming beyond the provision of foods. Lastly,
characteristics of program participants as well as the program’s impact on child diet quality and weight are not
well documented. Without this knowledge, it is challenging to characterize what works and for whom and
identify targets for optimizing the SFSP and for future interventions. The proposed research will conduct a
prospective observational study to describe program site and participant characteristics at baseline to evaluate
the current program implementation (Aim 1) and determine if the site and participant characteristics are
associated with child program attendance and changes in food insecurity, diet quality and weight gain (Aims 2
and 3). Two cohorts of elementary school-aged children and their parents (n=210) recruited through SFSP
sites in Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota will participate in data collection before and in the final
weeks of the program (spring and end of summer, respectively). Data collection components include an online
psychosocial survey, three 24-hour dietary recalls, and measurement of height, weight and percent body fat.
Additionally, parents will report program usage weekly during the program. A multi-disciplinary team of mentors
at the University of Minnesota will guide the proposed project and career development activities. Training areas
include: a) health equity approaches in reducing food insecurity and weight gain (Drs. Jayne Fulkerson and
Lisa Harnack), b) advanced statistical skills for use in evaluation of the long-term impacts of public health
programs (Dr. Weihua Guan), c) implementation science and intervention development (Dr. Nancy Sherwood)
and d) collaborations with community partners (Drs. Jayne Fulkerson and Lisa Harnack). The project and
training plan will position Dr. Lee to advance her career as an independent investigator while contributing to the
mission of the NIH by reducing weight-related health disparities of children living in low-income households."
10866018,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this NIDCR Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01) is to provide Dr.
Juan Hincapie-Castillo with the essential training to become an independent researcher in real-world evidence
for precision pain management applied to trigeminal neuralgia (TN). TN is associated with severe and
debilitating orofacial pain that can result in a significant decline in the quality of life for older adults. The aging
population experiencing TN is at high risk for central nervous system depression with psychotropic
medications, including antiepileptic drugs. Gabapentin, an antiepileptic commonly used to treat neuropathic
pain, is often prescribed as the initial medication for TN despite clinical recommendations of using
carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine as first line treatments – to date no evidence exists, outside limited case
reports, on the patient-reported lived experience nor comparative safety of these drugs in the real world.
Although real-world data sources, such as Medicare administrative claims, offer an opportunity to evaluate
drug-related health outcomes, valid causal inference requires contextual clinical knowledge and competency in
advanced analytical methods. The training goals in this K01 include: (1) Expanding clinical expertise in the
substantive area of orofacial pain and TN; (2) Building skills in primary data collection and engagement of
people with lived experience of pain in research; and (3) Learning and applying robust advanced causal
inference methods and machine learning algorithms for assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity. This
career development award will be carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will be
guided by a mentoring team comprising leading experts in biomedical research. Leveraging this mentored
training, Dr. Hincapie-Castillo will apply new expertise in TN and analytical skills into the following research
aims: (1) Document patient-reported experiences of initial diagnosis and treatment of TN through the collection
and synthesis of primary qualitative and quantitative data; (2) Develop and validate a Medicare claims-based
algorithm for incident diagnoses of TN by appraising reference diagnostic data from medical charts from a
large academic hospital; and (3) Investigate the risk of injurious falls caused by antiepileptics among Medicare-
insured patients diagnosed with TN using advanced causal inference pharmacoepidemiologic methods and
causal forests to identify variation in treatment effects. Study findings will generate critical real-world evidence
to guide patient-centered care in TN by contextualizing and assessing drug safety concerns relevant to older
adults. Extending beyond comparative safety evaluations in this patient population, this K01 award will lay the
foundation for future R01-level research focused on identifying effective pharmacological and non-
pharmacological TN treatments using novel machine learning methods in real-world data."
10866079,"Project Abstract
Over 90% of the human genome is transcribed into RNA, yet only ~1-2% represents protein-coding genes. Long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) make up the majority of these transcripts and have vital roles in chromatin
organization, gene expression control, and metabolic regulation. Despite their abundance, our understanding of
lncRNA function and regulation significantly lags behind that of proteins, leaving the vast majority of lncRNAs
understudied or completely uncharacterized. This knowledge gap not only limits our understanding of basic
cellular processes but also hinders our ability to therapeutically target RNA or design synthetic transcripts as
biomedicines. Significant technical challenges underlie this gap surrounding lncRNAs, and few tools exist for
directly studying their function. To address these problems, this proposal aims to develop and apply experimental
platforms to mechanistically understand lncRNA function by both mapping their interactomes in cellulo and
elucidating their structure-function relationships through CRISPR-based perturbation profiling. In Aim 1 I will
apply technology I have developed in my postdoc to directly map native lncRNA interactions with protein, RNA
and genomic sites using in situ hybridization photoproximity labeling. The platform will be first validated using
known lncRNAs and subsequently applied to probe uncharacterized oncogenic transcripts in breast cancer, as
well as mapping the cellular interactions of prime editing guide RNAs for genetic engineering. In Aim 2 I will
develop and apply CRISPR-based techniques for mechanistic profiling and functional discovery of lncRNAs
using phenotypic screening. This aim will directly explore the phenotypic contributions of oncogenic lncRNAs
with unknown mechanisms by measuring their influence on global expression levels using Perturb-seq single-
cell knockout. Additionally, pooled CRISPR knockout screening will be employed to identify novel lncRNAs that
influence cell migration and metastasis in vivo. Lastly, a novel approach combining minimization by iterative size-
exclusion and recombination (MISER) with CRISPR mutational scanning will classify key domains and residues
in lncRNAs, providing fundamental insights into their structural biochemistry and regulatory roles in cell behavior.
Overall, this research proposal aims to bridge the gap in our understanding of lncRNAs by developing innovative
tools for mapping interactomes and discovering functional mechanisms. Directly applying these tools will enable
systematic testing of hypotheses regarding lncRNA function and provide fundamental measurements of their
effects on global gene expression, cell growth, and motility. If successful, these platforms will deepen our
understanding of RNA function and significantly expand our capabilities for both targeting pathologic RNAs with
small molecules as well as enable future design and engineering of therapeutic transcripts and RNA biologics."
10869886,"The four projects of this Program Project heavily rely on the use of mouse models to demonstrate their
hypotheses. The purpose of the Histology and Histomorphometry Core is therefore to consolidate equipment
and expertise to provide the Investigators of these projects with state-of-the-art, quality controlled histologic
and histomorphometric analyses of bone, pancreas and brain specimen as well as microCT of mouse bones.
The Core contribution to this Program Project will be at 4 levels:
1. Processing mouse specimens for histology, immunolabeling and histomorphometry. Fixed and partially
 dehydrated mouse skeletons or pancreata will be embedded in plastic medium (vertebrae and long bones)
 or paraffin (pancreas). Fixed mouse brain specimen will either be sectioned without embedding or cryo-
 embedded and cryo-sectioned.
2. Performing specific stainings and immunostainings of mouse tissues sections. Classic histology stainings
 such as Hematoxylin/Eosin, Toluidine Blue, von Kossa/Van Gieson, Goldner trichrome, Cresyl violet as
 well as more specific reactive ones such as TUNEL and TRAP stainings will be performed by the Core
 personnel at the request of investigators. The Core will also perform immunodetection studies using
 fluorescent and enzymatic detection on sections.
3. Performing histomorphometric analyses of mouse bone, pancreas and brain specimens. The
 OsteoMeasure Histomorphometry System (OsteoMetrics Inc., Decatur, GA) will be used to assess static
 parameters, such as bone volume, trabecular number and cell counts, and dynamic parameters of bone
 formation, such as mineral apposition rates, from non-decalcified bone sections. It will also be used to
 quantify cell mass/proliferation in pancreas and TUNEL or BrdU positive cells in brain sections. Image J will
 be used for all other quantifications. The Core will provide investigators with histomorphometric data and
 will help them in evaluating their biological relevance.
4. Analyzing mouse bone specimen by microCT. Fixed and partially dehydrated mouse long bones and
 vertebrae will be provided to the Core by project investigators. These specimens will then be scanned
 using a VivaCT 40 microCT (Scanco Medical, Switzerland)."
10869888,"Project Summary – Project #1
The number and diversity of the physiological processes regulated by the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin
raise the question of the regulation of osteocalcin secretion in vivo. Moreover, the fact that circulating levels of
osteocalcin decrease so steeply in mice, horses, monkeys, and humans relatively early during life raises the
question as to whether increasing circulating levels of this hormone in older animals could correct at least in
part, manifestations of aging affecting the physiological process regulated by osteocalcin. In support of this
hypothesis, we have already gathered evidence that osteocalcin can indeed rescue the age-related decrease
in muscle functions and cognitive functions. To address in a more global manner the questions presented
above we searched for a regulator of osteocalcin secretion whose biology could be harnessed to demonstrate
that increasing osteocalcin secretion could correct some deleterious manifestations of aging. In performing
this endeavor we have accumulated strong preliminary evidence that neuron-derived glutamate enters
osteoblasts and, through competitive inhibition of the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, allows the release of
uncarboxylated osteocalcin from osteoblasts. We now want to 1) demonstrate the cell-specificity nature of this
mechanism, 2) test whether this mechanism can be harnessed to rescue at least in past manifestations of
aging caused by a decrease in the physiological functions that osteocalcin normally enhance. To achieve
these overlapping goals the Specific Aims of this application are:
 Establish in vivo that it is through its expression in cells of the osteoblast lineage that Glast influences
 the release of the uncarboxylated form of osteocalcin in the general circulation.
 Test whether overexpressing Glast in osteoblasts or osteocytes would improve energy expenditure,
 glucose metabolism, adaptation to exercise, cognitive functions and fertility in aging mice by favoring
 OCN release."
10869890,"Project Summary – Project #2
We have recently shown that osteoblast-derived LCN2 suppresses appetite. At the same time, LCN2 is known
as an acute phase response protein that following bacterial infections is highly increased in the serum. Since
Lcn2 is primarily expressed by osteoblasts, we explored, whether osteoblast-derived LCN2 is an early sensor
and regulator of inflammation. This response is of particular interest within the context of the aging population
in which immune system responses are weakened and inflammation more common. Our preliminary data,
using as a model of inflammatory response lipopolysaccharides (LPS) administration in mice, indicate that
following an inflammatory stimulus, brain-derived signals rapidly stimulate osteoblasts to secrete LCN2 in the
circulation. Release of LCN2 from osteoblasts is stimulated by glutamate and is regulated neuronally. This
response is compromised with aging and may contribute to inflammation susceptibility with old age. Circulating
LCN2 acts on key immune cells of the blood and other tissues and modulates their phenotype and subsequent
function to contain endotoxemia, organ damage, and mortality. Based on these and other preliminary data, we
hypothesize that bone is an acute inflammation-sensing organ that mounts lifesaving anti-
inflammatory responses through LCN2 secretion by osteoblasts. To examine this hypothesis we will
establish that osteoblast-derived LCN2 is required for mounting innate immune response using young and old
adult mice with osteoblast-specific deletion of Lcn2 and models of LPS and bacterial infection and sepsis;
inactivate the Grik5 receptor specifically in osteoblasts and examine whether it prevents LCN2 release in the
serum after inflammation and exacerbates disease in young adult and in aging mice; establish the signaling
pathway that originates in the brain and signals the release of LCN2 by osteoblasts in young adult and in aging
mice. These studies will define a new function of bone as an acute inflammatory stressor and responder and
delineate how the brain orchestrates a rapid response through bone and LCN2 to regulate systemic
inflammation with aging."
10869892,"The goal of this project is to characterize how gonadal failure may affect the bone-derived hormone
osteocalcin and its regulation of β-cell proliferation and function in mice and human. Osteocalcin (Ocn)
enhances β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in adult mice. It is primarily secreted by
osteoblasts as an inactive - carboxylated - form, which is released in blood and activated by bone resorption
via partial decarboxylation. Hence, physiological or pharmacological events enhancing bone formation and/or
resorption should increase blood levels of active Ocn and thereby enhance its positive effect on β-cell mass
and glucose metabolism.
Gonadal failure is a hallmark of aging that causes major stress to many organs in the body. In particular, bone
biology is profoundly affected. Indeed, upon sex steroid hormone depletion like the one accompanying
menopause, bone resorption is increased while bone formation does not increase to the same extent. The
regulation of Ocn by both bone formation and bone resorption thus raised the prospect that this age-dependent
hormonal disruption may affect blood levels of active Ocn and as a result β-cell proliferation and function. In
support of this hypothesis, pancreatic cell proliferation in rats is enhanced shortly after ovariectomy (OVX) and
our own preliminary results indicate that OVX and orchiectomized (ORCH) mice have 1) higher serum
levels of active Ocn, 2) an increase in β-cell mass due to enhanced β-cell proliferation, 3) a mild
increase in serum insulin levels and 4) normal blood glucose levels compared to sham-operated (sham)
controls. However, β-cell mass and insulin levels are not affected by OVX in Ocn-deficient mice or in
Gprc6aPdx1-/- mice and these mice become mildly hyperglycemic 14 days post-surgery. These
observations suggest that the effect of estrogen depletion on bone, and on the production of active Ocn,
positively impacts β-cell biology. We therefore hypothesize that this regulation could oppose the well-
described negative effect of decreased estrogen signaling on β-cell survival and as such preserve, at
least transiently, a normal control of glucose metabolism upon gonadal failure.
To test this hypothesis we will assess the effect of sex steroid depletion on osteocalcin biology, β-cell
biology and glucose metabolism in both mice and humans. Our Specific Aims (SA) are:
SA1: To define how estrogen depletion affects the production of active osteocalcin.
SA2: To define the Ocn-dependent effects of OVX on β-cell biology and glucose homeostasis.
SA3: To determine whether the positive effect of estrogen depletion on osteocalcin biology and its regulation of
β-cell proliferation and function is conserved in humans."
10869895,"PROJECT SUMMARY-Project #4
The bone-derived hormone osteocalcin (OCN) is released during bone remodeling, a process that declines with
age. Physiological functions regulated by OCN, such as fertility, glucose tolerance, and cognition, deteriorate
over the lifespan in parallel with circulating levels of the active form of OCN. Here we explore the possibility that
OCN regulates another age-dependent process, thermogenesis, through effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT).
We consider two types of thermoregulatory dysfunction in aging populations: cold intolerance and hot flashes.
BAT is a thermogenic organ that oxidizes fatty acids and glucose to produce heat. Cold or pharmacological
stimulation of BAT induces thermogenesis and improves glucose tolerance in mice and humans. Aging is
associated with diminished BAT function and increased risks of hypothermia and metabolic dysfunction. Little is
known about the causes and consequences of impaired BAT function in aging because most studies in animal
models exclusively evaluate young adults. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) tone, the primary driver of BAT
activity, is elevated in aged individuals. Thus, reduced BAT activity in aging reflects hyporesponsiveness to cold
and SNS signaling. Factors that can enhance sensitivity to SNS signals or regulate BAT function independent of
the SNS have the potential to improve metabolic and thermoregulatory dysfunction that accompanies aging.
OCN levels decrease in aging, in parallel with reduced responsiveness of BAT to cold and sympathetic signaling.
Conversely, OCN treatment is sufficient to stimulate a thermogenic gene program in brown adipocytes in vitro
and to protect against diet-induced obesity (DIO) by increasing energy expenditure and BAT capacity in vivo.
Studies in Aim 1 will explore whether loss of endogenous OCN increases susceptibility to cold and DIO via
diminished BAT function in Ocn-/- mutants and aged wild-type mice. Studies in Aim 2 will investigate the
mechanism by which exogenous OCN protects against DIO and ask whether restoring physiological levels of
OCN to aged mice will improve metabolic function and cold tolerance by activating BAT. Studies in Aim 3 will
consider another situation where OCN and thermoregulation are dysregulated, peri-menopausal hot flashes.
Estrogen depletion in the peri-menopausal period or following ovariectomy is associated with a burst of bone
resorption and a transient increase in active OCN levels. This period is often accompanied by thermal
dysregulation and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in the form of hot flashes. Conditions associated with reduced
bone absorption and OCN, including treatment with anti-resorptive compounds and obesity, are associated with
reduced risk of hot flashes. We will investigate the role of OCN in a mouse model of hot flashes. If successful,
this research will provide novel insights into the mechanism underlying sensitivity to cold and DIO in aged
individuals and hot flashes in peri-menopausal women understudied issues with widespread effects."
10869904,"Project Summary (Didactic Interactions)
Didactic Interactions are an integral core component of the proposed National Pediatric Rehabilitation Resource
Center (PedRehab Ctr). We plan to offer a wide mix of didactic activities to assist others in the following areas:
i) developing, rigorously testing, and appropriately measuring outcomes of new pediatric rehabilitation treatments
via a variety of research designs; ii) analyzing multivariate and longitudinal data from pediatric clinical trials that
face unique challenges, because children are developing at varying rates over the course of rehabilitation
treatment and throughout the follow-up period; iii) developing and applying tools to measure Fidelity of Treatment
Implementation; and iv) designing and conducting research in the relatively new field of Implementation Science,
so that efficacious treatments can be applied in a timely and effective way in real world settings to realize
maximum benefits. These Didactic Interactions offerings will be designed to be practically useful for scientists
and clinicians interested in furthering clinical pediatric rehabilitation research. We plan to be responsive to the
informational needs identified by the research community, clinicians, and parent and advocacy groups. A high
priority will be engaging investigators from historically underrepresented groups in science. The specific aims for
Didactic Interactions are:
 1) to conduct multiple informative and inviting presentations – including short courses, symposia,
demonstration workshops, roundtable discussions, and Webinars - at a wide range of national and international
professional meetings and venues each year. Over 5 years, we propose delivering a minimum of 30 events,
targeted to investigators in pediatric neurology, developmental pediatrics, physical medicine and rehabilitation
(physiatry), neonatology, general pediatrics, occupational therapy, physical therapy, child development,
neuroscience, and biostatistics, as well as to parent/advocacy groups interested in rehabilitation research;
 2) to link our major didactic presentations (specific aim 1 above) with timely follow-up activities
appropriate to the content of the presentation, the target audience, and the potential for supporting longer-term
collaborations and helping to developing promising pilot study applications;
 3) to use our new PedRehab Ctr Website to archive the Didactic Interactions offerings along with
supportive reference materials; and
 4) to pursue opportunities to coordinate with others, including the other P2C Medical Rehabilitation
Resource Centers, our CTSAs, national organizations, NIH special workshops, and StrokeNet, so that we
actively share relevant materials and work synergistically to minimize duplication of effort and to maximize
dissemination of high-quality, relevant didactic materials."
10869906,"Project Summary (Mentored Collaborative Opportunities)
We propose a range of Mentored Collaborative Opportunities that build on our team's expertise and distinctive
research resources at i) Virginia Tech (in Roanoke) with our Neuromotor Research Clinic, our Human
Neuroimaging Lab, and our new Treatment Implementation Center; ii) The Ohio State University (in Columbus)
with our PeaRL Lab (Pediatric and Rehabilitation Lab) offering sophisticated biomechanical (motion detector)
and behavioral recording capacity, our infant neuroimaging expertise, our Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation
Research Lab (IPARR) and our new Neuromotor Assessment Center; and iii) Nationwide Children's Hospital (in
Columbus), consistently rated as a “top ten” best children's hospital with a strong commitment to discovery and
an active portfolio of NIH pediatric rehabilitation trials from the neonatal period through adolescence. The
collaborations will build upon our team's presentations at major scientific meetings with planned follow-up
activities (see Didactic Interactions), our close work with recipients of small grants (see Pilot Studies), and our
team members' vigorous engagement in Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) and national and
international special research interest groups and NIH research networks, most centrally StrokeNet.
Specific aims for Mentored Collaborative Opportunities are:
1) to identify individuals and research teams well-positioned to make high-impact and novel contributions to
pediatric medical rehabilitation research. We seek to develop individually-tailored mentored collaborations to
strengthen the breadth and depth of knowledge and research skills among the collaborators; and
2) to provide intensive mentored collaborative experiences that focus on increasing the competencies of
investigators and the quality of their competitive applications in pediatric rehabilitation research. These include
a mix of educational and hands-on opportunities that will support Phase I through Phase III clinical trials,
comparative effectiveness and practice-based research, focused methods research, and Implementation
Science trials.
We will document all mentored collaborative opportunities we provide and solicit timely feedback from users
about the effectiveness and impact of the supports from our National Pediatric Rehabilitation Resource Center
(PedRehab Ctr). We reserve modest funding to help with some research expenses (e.g., specialized materials
and travel), although home institutions are expected to provide the majority of support for participants."
10869911,"Project Summary (Techniques Development)
The National Pediatric Rehabilitation Resource Center (PedRehab Ctr) will engage in development of techniques
we consider highly promising, responsive to critical gaps in methods or technology in the field, and potentially
multi-purpose in their application. Specifically, the areas we propose to pursue have application for both research
and clinical practice. Pediatric rehabilitation research would benefit immensely from more sensitive, valid, and
reliable approaches to measuring the emergence of new skills and their use in everyday function. Many tools in
the new Common Data Elements (CDEs) for Cerebral Palsy were developed initially for typically developing
children; others apply to only limited age ranges but often are used “off label;” and some designated as
“exploratory” or “highly promising” lack confirmation (and likely further refinement) of their psychometric
properties. Another major problem in pediatric rehabilitation trials has been the failure to measure Fidelity of
Treatment (i.e., adherence to intended treatment protocols). Our PedRehab Ctr scientists have been active in
developing and validating novel assessment tools from sophisticated kinematics to parent report tools; creating
first ever Fidelity of Treatment tools for pediatric Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy and Bimanual treatment;
and exploring the incorporation of various neuroimaging approaches to document treatment-induced
neuroplasticity. Our specific aims for Techniques Development are:
 1. To obtain confirmatory documentation of assessment methods for function, skill, and behaviors that go
 across laboratory and real-world environments. This includes use of kinematics and video-, game-,
 robotic-, and wearable-devices to supplement traditional standardized tests and systematic methods for
 establishing clinically meaningful thresholds for gain and losses;
 2. To standardize modifications and summary scoring methods of currently used tools to allow for greater
 specificity and for use with children who vary widely in age, severity, and etiologies of neuromotor
impairments;
 3. To advance the development of Fidelity of Treatment measures to provide much-needed
 documentation of the actual delivery of rehabilitation interventions; and
 4. To explore novel neuroimaging strategies for use as individual biomarkers and as valid, reliable
 indicators of treatment-induced neuroplasticity."
10869915,"Project Summary (Pilot Studies)
We propose to sponsor a Pilot Studies program as a highly attractive incentive for investigators to engage with
our National Pediatric Rehabilitation Resource Center (PedRehab Ctr). The Pilot Studies program will place high
priority on encouraging innovation and funding pilot studies with high potential for discovering efficacious
treatments and promoting their rapid, high-fidelity, and effective application into clinical and community settings
(Implementation Science). We also will consider methods and techniques development research under the Pilot
Studies program, particularly when the topic fills a critical gap or seeks to overcome a major obstacle to
conducting high-quality medical rehabilitation research with pediatric populations. We will invest the maximum
amount allowed ($150,000 per year X 5 years = $750,000). We have proposed a partnership with the American
Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) to assist in announcing, reviewing, and
scoring the Pilot Studies, based on its current strategic plan, a strong process of peer review and tracking of pilot
study outcomes, and its role in working closely with NIH to establish and promote the use of the new Common
Data Elements for Cerebral Palsy. Final funding decisions will be made by the PedRehab Ctr team with input
and approval from the independent National Advisory Board.
Our specific aims for Pilot Studies are: 1) to work collaboratively to encourage the development of highly
promising ideas and methods that will benefit from critically needed Pilot Study data in order to obtain larger
scale NIH funding; 2) to offer direct assistance to investigators and interdisciplinary research teams as they plan
and finalize their proposals; 3) to provide timely funding for those applications judged the most meritorious; 4) to
lend post-award direct assistance (including activities within our PedRehab Ctr for Mentored Collaborative
Opportunities and Techniques Development) to those who receive funding with the goal of maximizing
successful completion and later use of results; and 5) to monitor the scientific findings generated by the Pilot
Studies and how these are used in subsequent research activities. In partnership with AACPDM, we will collect
evaluative data from the recipients about the impact of the Pilot Studies program. Overall, our proposed Pilot
Studies program includes embedded mentoring and collaboration – from pre-submission through post-award."
10867569,"Project Summary/Abstract
The environmental justice (EJ) framework highlights the social, political, and economic
assumptions contributing to and producing unequal protection in EJ communities; highlighting
that understanding a community's perspectives is crucial to conducting impactful environmental
health research and literacy initiatives. There remains a need for novel research that facilitates
responsible reporting back of research results (RBRR) in a manner that raises data and
environmental health literacy (D/EHL) and supports communities striving for environmental health
and structural change. Despite recent progress in addressing longstanding EJ issues, the
bioethics literature focuses on: (a) harm, not beneficence or justice; (b) underestimates
opportunities to raise D/EHL among communities; and (c) commonly employs risk communication
strategies that are technical, and not based in a cultural model. The project goal is to create and
pilot a national model of report back that engages diverse rural and urban EJ communities to
ensure that RBRR reaches all populations in a manner tailored to their individual needs, including
culture, life stage, language, and design. Rooted in bioethics, the program focuses on how to
report back social determinants of health and soil and air quality data in rural and urban
communities that are disproportionately impacted by pollution. Building upon trusted and
established long-term partnerships and leveraging existing datasets, this project addresses cross-
cutting research themes anchored in health equity, communication approaches, and the use of
data report back. Through partnerships with community-based organizations and local
government agencies, this project will address community concerns and social/EJ challenges in
both rural, predominately Hispanic mining communities and urban, Black/African American
communities. The specific aims of this proposal include: (1) Using an equity-centered community
design approach to develop different design types and identify what influences preferred report
back strategies, (2) Within the context of specific populations (cultural identity) and groups (life
stage), elucidate key D/EHL learning outcomes by design type, (3) Identify, evaluate, and mitigate
the unintentional consequences of environmental health report back by working with both rural
and urban EJ communities, and (4) Develop capacity building tools for RBRR, train knowledge
mediators/brokers and evaluate the efficacy of these tools to support the role of “environmental
counselors”."
10933011,"Project Summary/Abstract
American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
pandemic compared to other racial/ethnic populations. AI/AN individuals experience a higher prevalence of
chronic diseases that increase risk of COVID-19 complications including cancer, diabetes, chronic liver
disease, chronic lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and obesity, and have higher rates of
smoking compared to other racial/ethnic groups. The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented
interruptions in necessary services, including healthcare, in response to social distancing mandates
implemented to reduce the transmission of the virus. Health care services were further disrupted due to the
necessary shift of clinical and hospital resources to COVID-19 patients. It remains unknown whether changes
in healthcare access for AI/AN people or chronic health conditions impacted uptake of COVID-19 testing and
vaccination and whether these changes differed by geography and sociodemographic factors (e.g., rurality and
area deprivation). There is, therefore, a critical need to understand the extent to which the pandemic influenced
access to healthcare and whether individuals with chronic health conditions had barriers to receiving COVID-
19 testing and vaccination. Our long-term goal is to improve access to COVID-19 testing and vaccination
among AI/AN people, particularly among those with chronic health conditions. Our overall objective of this
application is to analyze RADx-UP consortium data to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
AI/AN RADx-UP participants with chronic health conditions, changes in access to healthcare, and
sociodemographic factors on COVID-19 testing and vaccination uptake. We aim to identify whether chronic
health conditions, healthcare access, and sociodemographic factors impacted 1) access to COVID-19 testing
and 2) access to COVID-19 vaccination among AI/AN persons. Upon successful completion of this project, the
expected outcomes are that we will have identified barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccination uptake among
AI/AN RADx-UP participants with chronic health conditions, challenged healthcare access, and poor
sociodemographic factors. These results are expected to have a positive impact because empirical evidence of
barriers to COVID-19 testing and harmonization among high-risk populations will allow for development of
intervention strategies to improve health outcomes in this underserved population."
10878645,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older adults are particularly vulnerable to health impacts from climate-related events such as heat waves,
hurricanes, wildfires, and floods. These impacts include both physical and mental health such as experiencing
higher overall rates of mortality, likelihood of injury, disruption of medical treatments, and the experience of
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Understanding these disproportionate impacts is particularly important given
projections of a climate future with more frequent and more intense environmental extremes. Yet progress in
research on the Aging-Climate-Health nexus has been slowed by disciplinary silos and data challenges. The
proposed virtual Center on Aging, Climate, and Health (CACHE) responds directly to these challenges by
taking a multi-pronged approach to the development of infrastructure to accelerate research advancements.
The development of CACHE will take place in two phases with Years 1-2 (R61) involving several
demonstration research projects integrating social and environmental data and the development of a strong
online presence to facilitate sharing of data, code, and training materials in support of interdisciplinary
scholarship. While a large amount of long-term climate and disaster data are publicly available, they are in
formats unfamiliar to health and social scientists and, thus, require technical and substantive expertise to use.
CACHE will offer the necessary training and resources to overcome these substantial barriers. During this
initial phase, the Center will also recruit an interdisciplinary affiliate base through outreach efforts involving its
Executive Committee and Advisory Board that represents environmental demography, aging, health, and
climate science. A proof-of-concept training session on climate data will be offered prior to the end of Year 2. In
Years 3-5 (R33), we build on this foundational work by expanding to offer additional trainings on multi-scale
social-environmental analysis, data visualization, and other important methodological topics, while also further
developing the Center’s blog to publicly grapple with research challenges in this arena. CACHE will also offer
seed grants to support the early stages of promising research and, in support of building an interdisciplinary
community, will provide funding for topical workshops to bring together scholars interested in critical areas with
knowledge gaps. Yearly mini conferences offer a space to share ideas, provide feedback, and identify
important questions and collaborative opportunities. In all, the work emphasizes the bridging of data platforms
and the crossing of interdisciplinary silos to bring multiple disciplinary perspectives to bear within the
increasingly important topical area of Aging, Climate, and Health."
10881755,"Project Summary
Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) are small near-icosahedral viruses that
use RNA as genetic material to infect bacteria through retractile pili. Recently >15,000 new ssRNA
phages have been identified but their hosts and mechanisms of infection remain unknown. Of the
steps during the infection cycle of ssRNA phages, how phages package the genomic RNA and
recognize its specific host are only known for model ssRNA coliphages such as MS2 and Qβ; and
how RNA is ultimately delivered into the cytosol is obscure. From the preliminary data, the PIs
find that the previous paradigm set for the infection mechanism of ssRNA phage based on model
coliphages can no longer be applied to other ssRNA phages.
Host receptors of ssRNA phages, the retractile pili, are usually involved in the virulence of
pathogenic bacteria and the sharing of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. This project will focus on
phages PP7 and AP205, which infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.,
respectively, via the Type IV pili (T4P). The overall goal is to determine the mechanisms involved
in PP7/AP205 packaging, and RNA penetration into the host, a process which involves both host
recognition and RNA entry. Specific aims are to reveal the molecular mechanisms for (1) the
packaging of PP7/AP205, (2) the interplay between PP7/AP205 and T4P before RNA entry, and
(3) the detachment of T4P during RNA entry. This work will not only reveal insights into the
infection mechanism of ssRNA phages but also provide guidelines to engineer ssRNA phages for
the following purpose: ssRNA phages will be engineered as means to detach pili of pathogenic
bacteria, as an alternative strategy for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Unlike
traditional phage therapy by lysing pathogens, virulence and antibiotic resistance spread are
inactivated by breaking pili while leaving the cells to grow, without exerting selective pressure on
the host to develop further resistance. Such a method also avoids the release of any unwanted
cell contents including DNA, proteins, and toxins into the environment which could interfere with
other bacteria or affect human cells. In the future, the proposed project will also provide a basis
for developing a method for packaging and delivery of a large number of foreign RNAs into
bacterial cells. Due to the short life of RNAs inside the cell, they allow transient regulation of the
cells and are less likely to exert long-term genetic effects as in the case of DNA plasmids. In
addition, RNA delivery with ssRNA phages does not rely on the artificial preparation of cells
competent for heat-shock or electroporation, which is hard to perform in situ."
11116155,"Project Summary
Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) are small near-icosahedral viruses that
use RNA as genetic material to infect bacteria through retractile pili. Recently >15,000 new ssRNA
phages have been identified but their hosts and mechanisms of infection remain unknown. Of the
steps during the infection cycle of ssRNA phages, how phages package the genomic RNA and
recognize its specific host are only known for model ssRNA coliphages such as MS2 and Qβ; and
how RNA is ultimately delivered into the cytosol is obscure. From the preliminary data, the PIs
find that the previous paradigm set for the infection mechanism of ssRNA phage based on model
coliphages can no longer be applied to other ssRNA phages.
Host receptors of ssRNA phages, the retractile pili, are usually involved in the virulence of

10881757,"As of 2017, 78% of US Veterans are overweight or obese consuming a Western diet characterized by a high
intake of saturated fat. It is well-established that obesity is associated with increased risk of developing colorectal
cancer, the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Adipose tissue
is the largest endocrine organ producing and secreting extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying molecular cargo that
can be taken up by recipient cells, resulting in intra-organ communication. Our preliminary data suggest that EV
secretion is increased from adipose tissue from obese humans and mice. Additionally, obese adipose tissue EVs
are enriched with enzymes involved in the fatty acid (FA) metabolic process. Fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) is a
catabolic pathway in the mitochondria crucial for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation for cancer cell
survival and growth. Initiation and progression of colorectal cancer is thought to involve an accumulation of
genetic mutations predominantly in Lgr5+ colonic crypt base columnar (CBC) stem cells that confer a clonal
advantage and expansion. However, the role of FAO in Lgr5+ CBCs remains unknown and the effect of adipose
tissue-derived EVs on mitochondrial metabolism or function of colonic Lgr5+ CBCs has not been studied. Our
preliminary data suggest that EVs derived from obese adipose tissue increase persistence of colonic Lgr5+
stem/progenitor function that is dependent on FAO. We also show that obese adipose EV-induced FAO
increases β-Catenin transcriptional activation, which is crucially important for CBC stemness and crypt
proliferation. EVs derived from adipose tissue of obese mice increase colon tumoroid growth dependent on FAO.
We will test the hypothesis that EVs originating in the adipose tissue stimulate distant CBC stem cells, and in
obese individuals, favor the progression to CRC. We propose 3 specific aims to test this hypothesis: Aim 1. To
determine whether EVs shed from obese adipose tissue contain cargos that alter colonic CBC metabolism, CBC
function, and epithelial homeostasis; Aim 2. Define the mechanism whereby obese adipose EVs drive CBC
functional changes to enhance tumorigenesis; and Aim 3. Define the anti-tumor response of targeting pathways
altered by adipose EVs in CRC. Our long-term goal is to determine whether targeting adipose EV-induced
signaling pathways in the colon is an effective therapeutic strategy to combat colorectal cancer during obesity."
10878441,"Project Summary
In the US, over five million individuals, including 450,000 children, lack or have limited language and speech
abilities and could benefit from Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). Evaluating and monitoring
the language performance of these individuals when using AAC is crucial for providing the appropriate
intervention to improve language and communication functions. However, traditional language sample analysis
(LSA) tools and procedures do not adequately capture language samples generated by AAC devices, such as
tracking key presses and timings. Additionally, the time-consuming nature of the traditional LSA process hinders
the motivation of speech-language pathologists to perform regular LSA evaluations over time. Therefore, there
is a critical need to build an easy-to-use and objective AAC language sample collection and analysis (ALSCA)
system that includes a wearable finger ring system and an AI-implemented data portal to efficiently automate
the AAC data collection and analysis process. Without such a system, the promise of AAC intervention for those
who need it will remain limited. Our central hypothesis is that automated AAC data collection and analysis using
the ALSCA system will provide valid and sufficient expressive lexical measures of AAC language samples to
build more extensive databases to guide the development of future intervention strategies. We will evaluate the
central hypothesis with three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and test a smart finger ring using an inertial
measurement unit (IMU) and computational methods for automatic data collection and classification. In Aim 2,
we will refine a pilot AAC automatic speech recognition model using a dataset from various AAC speakers for
automatic AAC data transcription. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the validity and reliability of the analytic result of the
ALSCA data portal. This innovative project will be the first study integrating an IMU finger ring, machine-learning
algorithms, an ASR model, and a data portal that allows SLPs and researchers to collect automated, valid,
reliable, and meaningful data from AAC users to develop and test targeted interventions. This project also aims
to automate the language sample transcription and analysis process, freeing clinicians and researchers from
tedious and time-intensive LSA tasks. Successful development of the project could significantly advance AAC
LSA and enable clinicians to provide meaningful, timely interventions that appropriately address individual AAC
users’ needs without investing time in the tedious LSA steps. Furthermore, this project aims to develop an
efficient AAC data collection and analysis solution to facilitate AAC studies and address crucial knowledge gaps
in language and communication development and rehabilitation in AAC populations."

Background & Significance: Approximately 20% of US households do not speak English at home based on
the most recent census data. These persons may have limited English proficiency at a level that affects their
ability to communicate during a healthcare encounter. Across the lifespan, research has demonstrated that when
hospitalized, compared to English speakers people with limited English proficiency have worse and inequitable
outcomes. These include higher rates of adverse events, higher rates of harm from adverse events, increased
risk for hospital readmission from any point after discharge, delays getting surgery, and longer lengths of stay.
Because all of these outcomes are sensitive to hospital nursing practices, hospital-based nurses have the
potential to improve these outcomes. Previous research by the study’s team, however, has demonstrated that
research has not examined how to optimize hospital nurses’ work with persons with limited English proficiency.
Purpose: This formative multiple methods research study will generate detailed data about hospital nurses’
practices accessing language access services and help enhance our understanding of where practice associated
inequities may occur. Setting: The proposed study will take place in the New York University Langone Health
System—a four hospital urban-suburban system serving a linguistically diverse population. Methods: A narrative
qualitative analysis will explore how hospital-based nurses describe their approaches to surveillance with LEP
patients. Using purposive and stratified sampling approaches, we will recruit nurses who practice in diverse
settings (e.g. ICU, medical-surgical, obstetrics, emergency department, pediatrics, psychiatry, and perioperative)
to participate in semi-structured interviews for a total sample of n=94 (range of 22-32 participants/hospital).
Simultaneously, using standardized approaches we will develop, pilot test, and psychometrically evaluate an
instrument designed to measure nurses’ practices accessing and implementing language services in hospital
settings. The goal of the instrument is to assess nurses’ clinical practices with limited English proficiency persons
to identify opportunities for practice improvement interventions that can improve their outcomes. Implications:
Overall, the study will produce the foundational data needed for the next phase of the work: 1) Development of
an organizational intervention to improve nursing practice with LEP patients and 2) the ability to link self-reported
practices to patient electronic health record data to study the practice-outcome link. The study addresses the
research priorities of the National Institute for Nursing Research in the areas of health equity, the social
determinants of health, and systems and models of care."
10890735,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nearly 1 million people in the US were diagnosed with a methamphetamine (METH) use disorder (MUD) in 2017.
Once established, MUD can last a long time and is very difficult to treat. Yet there are still no FDA-approved
medications indicated specifically for MUD. Anti-METH antibodies have been tested preclinically in efficacy
models and have shown the ability to reduce METH’s stimulant effects in rodents. In humans, these same
antibodies alter METH PK by reducing volume of distribution and likely decreasing distribution to the brain.
Current antibodies would be dosed once a month; longer-acting agents would increase compliance due to less
frequent dosing. The goal of this application is to identify a follow-on anti-METH monoclonal antibody with an
extended half-life and conduct IND-enabling development and toxicology studies so that at the end of the project
it is ready for a first-in-human clinical trial. In addition to increased compliance, the benefits of a long-acting
antibody for treating MUD may include lower cost of treatment and overall better clinical outcomes. The identified
antibody will also be fully humanized, which may lower the risk of antigenicity upon chronic dosing.
The project will be accomplished through four Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to select the final lead candidate long-
acting antibody. A panel of seven previously humanized METH-binding regions will be produced as Fabs and
tested in a METH-stimulated locomotor model in rats. The best will be paired with two IgG constant domains that
have selected mutations to extend their half-life. The two IgG will be compared in the same efficacy model, along
with in vitro characterization, and the final candidate selected.
In Aim 2, a clonal cell line and scalable manufacturing process will be developed for the final candidate IgG. A
Master Cell Bank will be generated from the cell line and used for manufacture of clinical batches. A 50L run will
produce material for development work and testing, then a 250L batch will be made to provide antibody for
toxicology testing in Aim 3. Finally, a 500L GMP batch will be manufactured for first-in-human clinical studies.
IND-enabling toxicology studies in rats will be conducted under Aim 3. A single-dose study will test IV doses up
to 1.5 g/kg. A multiple-dose study will test doses up to 1 g/kg given every other week for six months. Antibody
toxicokinetics and immunogenicity will be determined along with typical toxicology outcomes.
Aim 4 consists of the development of the regulatory submissions and other preparations for initial clinical trials.
A pre-IND meeting will be held with FDA following the completion of Aim 1, then a clinical protocol will be fully
developed based on the discussion. As the program develops, the entire IND including quality, nonclinical, and
FDA-specific modules will be written and submitted at the end.
The expected outcome of this project is a clinic-ready humanized monoclonal antibody to treat MUD that only
has to be dosed once every 2-3 months. Such a candidate would deliver improved patient outcomes with lower
treatment burden and higher adherence."

Nicotine consumption in both combustible tobacco (cigarettes) and with electronic nicotine delivery systems
(ENDS), or vaping, has become a serious health threat in the United States, particularly among adolescents.
Decades of research have documented the many ways adolescent social networks, particularly friendship
networks, influence the initiation, continued use, and brand choice of tobacco products. To date, however,
there is no data or research on how friendship networks influence ENDS use. This study addresses this gap by
proposing to add friendship network questions to two newly initiated cohorts of approximately 2,500 high
school students each that are measuring ENDS use. Funding has already been acquired for the data collection
for these cohorts and will start in November 2019 and October 2020. IRB approval to add the social network
questions has been submitted to the IRB after consultation with the director of the USC office for the protection
of human subjects. The friendship network questions to be added ask the students to name their closest
friends in their grade at school. The names of all consented students are pre-entered into a roster so that the
names auto-fill after a few letters are entered. This process has been implemented in other non-nicotine
studies and works well. These data will then be used to test whether adolescents are influenced by their
friends to initiate and continue ENDS use, as well as whether friends influence brand and flavor choices and
marijuana uptake. In addition, network selection processes will be tested which occurs when people make
network changes to be consistent with their behavior. Additional hypotheses to be tested include determining
whether peer influence and selection: (1) are stronger among homophilous and/or stronger ties; (2) extends to
dual- or poly-use; (3) occurs for brands and flavors choices; (4) occurs for dual ENDS and marijuana use.
Given the longitudinal nature of the data we will construct ENDS and tobacco use trajectories and determine if
network changes are associated with different trajectories. In sum, this proposal represents a timely
opportunity to add a crucial piece of data to two newly initiated funded cohorts of school-based adolescent
ENDS studies; namely, friendship network data. Preliminary data from a cross-sectional sample of 1,616
students in one school district in South Dakota showed a strong correlation between individual vaping and
friend vaping. Longitudinal data are needed to determine the direction of this relationship and apply more
sophisticated analytic techniques such as stochastic actor-oriented models."

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a variety of bothersome storage and emptying symptoms,
including urgency and stress urinary incontinence, frequent and/or urgent urination, nocturnal enuresis (i.e.,
bed-wetting), difficulty urinating, dribbling after urination, and bladder or urethral pain before, during, or after
urination. More than 200 million people worldwide and over 15% of women aged 40 years or older suffer from
urinary incontinence. In fact, women are 2-3 times more likely to experience urinary incontinence and 4 times
more likely to experience a urinary tract infection in comparison to men. For decades LUTS research has
focused on underlying pathology, disease mechanisms, and treatment efficacy. The NIDDK took a bold step by
introducing the concept of prevention as an important priority for women's urologic research.
Through its transdisciplinary team science approach, the Prevention of Lower Urinary tract Symptoms
Research Consortium (PLUS-RC) is creating new conceptual models and paradigms, developing innovative
measures, establishing evidence, and leading and seeding research on bladder health and LUTS prevention.
As the Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) for this unique consortium since its inception, we are
excited to further develop the evidence base to empower women and their communities to advocate for an
environment that supports healthy bladders.
During this next grant period, we plan to (1) provide leadership, management, and biostatistical support in the
design and implementation of a nationally and regionally representative prospective longitudinal cohort study to
assess the distribution of bladder health and evaluate potential risk and protective factors that influence
bladder health status; (2) provide leadership, management, and biostatistical support in the analysis of existing
studies (quantitative and qualitative) that will lead to the collaborative development of conceptual models that
guide analyses within the observational study above, and new studies that support future primary or secondary
prevention initiatives; (3) provide leadership in the principles and process devoted to item development,
instrument development, and psychometric evaluation and scoring; (4) facilitate a network of community
stakeholders to assist and collaborate in the process of data collection development, execution, and
dissemination; (5) foster transdisciplinary team science across all consortium activities and centers; and (6)
provide administrative leadership and logistical support and coordination of meetings of the Steering
Committee, all subcommittees, the Executive Committee, the External Expert Panel, and the pilot and
feasibility studies program, for the efficient and ethical execution of consortium objectives."

Social support, a social determinant of health (SDoH), is a definitive predictor of breast cancer (BC) treatment
and mortality outcomes. Because of the recognition that social support is critical to BC patient outcomes,
clinicians within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) have documented information on social
support in the electronic health record (EHR) since the advent of Epic in 2005. However, no EHR-based social
support measure currently exists to help clinicians identify patients at high risk of low social support. Such a
measure has high relevance for addressing racial/ethnic disparities in BC treatment and outcomes. Therefore,
we propose to develop an Electronic Health Record Social Support Patient Risk Tool (EHR-SUPPORT) that
could be used to identify women with BC at risk of low social support for referral to social support resources.
We propose to: 1) Identify terms in the EHR, based on theory and prior literature, and informed by KPNC
stakeholders in BC care, that reflect structural and/or functional social support, and have been associated with
BC treatment and outcomes; 2) Develop EHR-SUPPORT, using structured, semi-structured, and unstructured
data (to include natural language processing of text) that identifies patients at risk of low social support, overall
and by race/ethnicity, and validate the measure against published social support measures; and 3) Evaluate
associations of EHR-SUPPORT and its component variables with BC treatment (surgery and chemotherapy
delays, nonadherence to hormonal therapy) and BC-specific and total mortality, overall and by race/ethnicity in
44,348 women diagnosed with stage I-IV BC within Kaiser Permanente Northern California between 2006-
2023 including 3,450 Black, 4,441 Hispanic, 6,571 Asian women, and 28,589 non-Latina white women. In an
exploratory aim, we will develop, with KP clinician stakeholders, steps to the implementation of EHR-
SUPPORT. We will review 100 medical records (25 in each race/ethnic group) within two months of diagnosis,
informed by investigator expertise and clinician stakeholders, to develop terms used to describe patient
support. In addition to developing structured data, we will use natural language processing of text fields to
further develop social support indicators (Aim 1). EHR-SUPPORT will be computed from social support
indicators; we will use linear and logistic regression to validate the developed measure against established
social support measures in Pathways, a well-established cohort of 4,505 women with BC and use factor
analytic and confirmatory factor analytic methods as well as ROC curves to further evaluate the score (Aim 2).
We will use linear, logistic, and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate associations in Aim 3. The
unique convergence of EHR and cohort data provides the first opportunity to develop and validate an EHR-
based social support measure in in diverse women with BC, adjusted for an extensive set of covariates. This
work is central to identifying patients at elevated risk of low social support and to enhancing social support-

10890667,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Mammalian tissues engage in specialized physiology that is regulated through
reversible modification of protein cysteine residues by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS regulate a myriad
of biological processes, and dysregulation of ROS and redox signaling is one of the longest postulated underlying
causes of physiological decline of tissues with age. Despite the widespread importance of redox regulation of
tissue-specific physiology and mammalian aging, there is a persistent lack of information regarding the specific
protein modifications that explain the molecular basis for these processes in vivo.
We recently developed a mass spectrometric (MS) technology for the first comprehensive and quantitative
mapping of the mouse cysteine redox proteome in vivo. Our current objective is to define the landscape and
mechanisms of cysteine oxidation networks that underlie age-dependent tissue pathology and lifespan. Our
preliminary data demonstrate a fundamental remodeling of cysteine oxidation networks occurs in all aged
tissues, and many of these networks map to established disease-relevant protein families. We will test the
hypothesis that coordinated redox regulation governs spatial organization, assembly, and function of protein
networks already known to be relevant to age-related disease. Building on additional preliminary data, we will
test the hypothesis that interventions that robustly extend lifespan and healthspan exert systematic remodeling
of protein cysteine oxidation networks.
To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the following specific aims. In Aim 1 we will systematically determine
the role that cysteine oxidation plays in coordinating these protein complex network assemblies. Moreover, for
two priority protein networks already associated with diseases of aging, we will define the role of cysteine
oxidation on corresponding biological function and lifespan. In Aim 2 we will redox regulated networks that are
regulated by the longevity promoting intervention of dietary restriction will determine those pro-longevity cysteine
oxidation networks that are conserved across sexes and throughout evolution by applying parallel redox
proteomics analyses in models of C. elegans aging and DR. We will additionally determine the mechanisms and
metabolic consequences of redox regulation of newfound redox regulated targets of α-ketoglutarate metabolism,
which we hypothesize play a central role in DR-mediated metabolic regulation. Taken together, we propose to
define, for the first time, the proteome-wide redox regulatory landscape that defines tissue aging and DR-
dependent promotion of lifespan. Successful completion of these Aims will define mechanisms for a mode of
biological regulation by ROS that has long been associated with aging, but for decades has remained elusive."
10890670,"ABSTRACT
To fully understand the basic biology that underlies human aging, and accurately time potential treatments that
are aimed at preventing age-related pathology, it will be of vital importance to determine when the events that
precipitate human aging occur. One of the processes that drives human aging is mitochondrial mutagenesis.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations accumulate as we grow older, which accelerates the natural aging
process and contributes to various age-related diseases, including cancer, muscle wasting and
neurodegeneration. However, due to the multiplicity of mitochondrial genomes in a cell, de novo mtDNA
mutations are initially harmless. MtDNA mutations need to clonally expand to cause disease. Because this
expansion process takes time, we hypothesize that the mutations that precipitate age-related pathology arise
relatively early in life, and that the pace of mitochondrial aging is set long before pathology becomes apparent.
We propose to test this hypothesis with a new mouse model of DNA polymerase gamma (PolgA), the enzyme
that replicates the mitochondrial genome. This model expresses an error prone version of DNA polymerase
gamma that can be replaced with a WT allele at will. Accordingly, we can turn off mitochondrial mutagenesis at
any time during the animal’s lifespan and determine how mutations that occur early in life affect pathology later
in life. In addition, we will use various mutation detection techniques, including random mutation capture, single
cell sequencing and duplex sequencing to track the fate of these mutations over the lifespan of our mice.
These experiments will describe the natural history of every possible mtDNA mutation in various tissues,
effectively dissecting the parameters that control the impact of mtDNA mutations on human health. Finally, we
propose to rejuvenate somatic cells and aging mice by manipulating mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy, in an
attempt to cure them from deleterious mtDNA mutations. If successful, this strategy could provide a potential
treatment for multiple pediatric mtDNA diseases, as well as the mitochondrial component of age-related
diseases. Accordingly, our experiments have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the relationship
between mitochondrial mutagenesis and aging, and provide powerful new tools to combat both inherited and
age-related diseases that are associated with mtDNA mutations."

 Our laboratory is interested in developing new inorganic chemistry tools to address unmet needs in the
areas of bioconjugation, recognition, and imaging. In order to tackle these challenges, new molecular scaffolds
and biocompatible chemistry are crucial. The overall objective of this competitive MIRA renewal application is to
further advance the field of organomimetic boron cluster chemistry. Organomimetic features of these clusters
arise from 1) their ability to undergo facile functionalization chemistry with a wide array of substituents, forming
stable covalent bonds attached to the cluster¢s vertices and 2) unique 3D aromaticity, rendering these clusters
amenable for several modes of microscopy imaging. Within the scope of this work is also a set of new, rapid
organometallic transformations that were discovered during the original cycle of the MIRA funding that would
allow one to rationally tether boron clusters and other molecules under biologically relevant conditions.
 Our laboratory is interested in developing new transformations that mimic the operational simplicity with
which thiol ligands normally assemble onto a metallic gold surface. This chemistry has previously revolutionized
the ease with which we can create hybrid noble metal nanoparticles (e.g., thiol capped gold nanoparticles -
AuNPs). However, these hybrid AuNPs are not atomically precise, and the ligand corona is dynamic. These
features lead to hybrids with a non-uniform composition and size, ultimately limiting their applications for the
inhibition of protein-biomolecule interactions. Addressing this challenge, we have developed organometallic-
based methods for cluster modification, providing a covalently tethered dense corona of functional biomolecules
and ligands spatially arranged with three-dimensional precision. We propose to further expand this approach to
rapidly build up sophisticated atomically-precise 3D nanomolecules for multivalent binding to various biological
targets, including virus entry receptors, biological membranes, and cellular growth factors. We also propose to
utilize the inherent robustness and reaction kinetics associated with the developed Au-based reagents for
biomolecular positron-emission tomography (PET) labeling. We have also been engaged in the development of
new boron cluster chemistry, allowing for the positioning of multiple reactive functional groups on a three-
dimensional cluster and use these rigid 3D species to label and tether biomolecules to achieve unconventional
folding and recognition. We propose chemistry that will enable the labeling of small molecules, peptides, proteins,
and cells with various boron cluster scaffolds, which can subsequently be used as multivalent binders, affinity
tags, and fluorescent-free labels using Raman microscopy imaging. Lastly, we propose the use of
perfunctionalized boron clusters as dual staining/fluorophore agents for correlative light and electron microscopy
(CLEM). Specifically, we will work on developing hybrids that contain heavy atom perfunctionalized boron cluster
stains tethered to a fluorescent dye, which would enable targeting of specific cellular organelles, thereby
providing access to an unprecedented class of photostable and non-toxic agents for CLEM."

 Maternal substance use (SU) is a significant and growing public health problem. In 2020, over 26 million
U.S. women used illicit substances, and SU rates among women giving birth have nearly quadrupled in the last
decade. Despite these realties, mothers with substance use disorders (SUDs) remain an underserved and
understudied population. For Black mothers in the U.S., the lack of research on risk, protective factors, and
effective elements of treatment for maternal SU is even more pronounced. For example, while a growing body
of research demonstrates the negative effects of racism-related trauma on a wide-range of health outcomes,
no quantitative studies, and only a handful of qualitative studies have examined the contributions of racism-
related trauma to maternal SU outcomes in Black women. For Black U.S. mothers, their own experiences of
racism-related trauma, and the parenting stress they can experience in worrying about and processing their
children’s experiences with racism, likely significantly impact feelings of fear, helplessness, parenting
competence, and parenting stress which can all contribute to maternal SU risk. While racism-related trauma
likely contributes to Black mother’s SU risk, in part through amplifying parenting stress, the parenting role, and
particularly the quality of mother-child relationships, may also serve as a critical SU protective factor. One
factor that has been shown to bolster the quality of the parent-child relationship and improve maternal SU
outcomes is maternal mentalizing, defined as the capacity and tendency for mothers to observe and make
generally accurate inferences about thoughts, emotions and intentions of themselves and others, including
their child, and how they affect behavior. Recent maternal SU intervention studies show that improving
maternal mentalizing improved mother-child relationship quality, buffered against the effects of other/non-
racism related trauma on SU, and improved SUD recovery outcomes. Thus, mentalizing is likely an important
protective factor for maternal SU outcomes, but no studies have investigated if maternal mentalizing may serve
as a protective factor against the effects of racism-related trauma for Black mothers struggling with SUDs.
 The objective of the proposed study is to collect and analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data on
experiences of racism-related trauma and maternal mentalizing in a unique sample of Black mothers with
SUDs who are seeking treatment at Drexel University College of Medicine’s Caring Together Program (>80%
of patients identify as Black/AA; 85% are mothers of dependent children). This research will contribute to
NIDA’s research priorities to: 1) better understand the real-world complexities and the impact of important
social factors on maternal SUDs; and 2) conduct research that will significantly impact the promotion of health
equality in SU research and practice. Accomplishing the study aims will provide important data on SUD risk
and protective factors for Black/AA mothers and be a first step towards a future RO1 submission aimed at
developing culturally responsive evidence-based assessment tools and intervention strategies."
10888590,"NMR Fragment-based Design of New β-lactamase Inhibitors.
SUMMARY
A rapid and widespread increase in antimicrobial resistance over the past few decades has seriously threatened
our capability to treat bacterial infections that may persist following treatment with last-resort antibiotics such as
carbapenems and polymyxins. Given bacterial β-lactamase enzymes can degrade β-lactam antibiotics, β-
lactamase inhibitors have been widely sought to improve the efficacy of this antibiotics class. Since the majority
of recently approved antimicrobial agents for Gram-negative pathogens are β-lactam + β-lactamase inhibitor
combinations, the validity of this approach is widely accepted. However, microbial β-lactamases are constantly
evolving into new forms that can evade the activity of β-lactamase inhibitors. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy can generate high-resolution structural and dynamics information on proteins like β-lactamases
and map atomic details of interacting chemical entities like β-lactamase inhibitors. These structural details create
new opportunities such as fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). These techniques are at the forefront of
many research programs and have proven successful in antimicrobial drug development. The fragment-based
approach is distinct from high-throughput screening of drug libraries and has yet to be applied to β-lactamase
inhibitor development. Here our objective is to expand the use of FBDD and discover new chemistry by designing
inhibitors against β-lactamases TEM-1, SHV-1, PDC-3, and OXA-40. The specific goals for this project are to
develop new inhibitors based on the diazabicyclooctane scaffold and to generate detailed NMR maps of this set
of β-lactamases. Backed by our preliminary data that has identified 69 TEM-1 interacting fragments, our multi-
faceted approach relies on structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and microbiology approaches to advance the
fragment-based methodology for the identification of new β-lactamase inhibitors. These inhibitors will be
designed around a drug scaffold that targets the active site of broad-spectrum β-lactamases, therefore our
approach should result in the identification of potent inhibitors active against a broad spectrum of resistant
bacteria. Moreover, we will perform NMR relaxation studies to explore allosteric mechanisms in β-lactamases.
Public Health Impact: The World Health Organization has given the highest priority to anti-microbial research
on the Gram-negative bacteria genera Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas, as well as specific species of
Enterobacterales in which extensively-drug resistant strains are increasingly emerging. These resistant strains
can cause systemic infection and may not respond to known antibiotics that are rendered ineffective due to
specialized enzymes produced by the bacteria that degrade and thereby confer resistance to important classes
of antibiotics such as β-lactams. The goal of this project is to develop a structure-based methodology to devise
inhibitors against a model β-lactamase and then extend the methodology to other enzymes synthesized by
extensively-drug resistant bacterial strains. The efficacy of our inhibitors will be tested in conjunction with known
β-lactam antibiotics using clinical bacterial isolates and appropriate infection models."

Some autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus or “lupus,” are now known
to occur because of the pathogenic excess of an intracellular disaccharide called Man(b1-
4)GlcNAc. The accumulation of this disaccharide in cells can lead to the erroneous activation of
immune responses, leading to autoimmunity. The molecular mechanisms through which Man(b1-
4)GlcNAc regulate autoimmunity remain unknown, due to the difficulties of capturing the
intracellular interactors and receptors of free oligosaccharides, like Man(b1-4)GlcNAc. We will
use a chemoproteomic mass spectrometry-based approach to elucidate the interactome of
Man(b1-4)GlcNAc to identify its functional receptors. The accomplishments resulting from this
work will result in an enhanced understanding of aberrant glycosylation and the bioactivity of free
Man(b1-4)GlcNAc, as well as pave the pathway for studying the interactomes of intracellular free
oligosaccharides."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to dramatic declines in morbidity and mortality for people with
HIV (PWH). However, as PWH age, the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has increased, with a projected
lifetime burden among PWH of 65% for men and 44% for women. The higher observed risk of CVD in PWH
compared with the general population is a result of the higher prevalence of established CVD risk factors
(smoking, alcohol, dyslipidemia), and direct effects of HIV infection, including immunodeficiency and
inflammation. Recent studies have also implicated integrase strand inhibitors and other ART with increases in
body weight, which may further increase risk of CVD. There are also many understudied social and economic
conditions that may contribute to the high CVD risk in PWH, including disparities in healthcare access and
treatment, social isolation, history of trauma, and HIV stigma. While most studies have considered the impact
of CVD risk factors in isolation, it is well known that many frequently co-occur, such as smoking, alcohol,
obesity and depression. Furthermore, the ways in which social factors exacerbate the effect of biomedical CVD
risk factors among PWH is not well understood. Using a syndemics framework, which is uniquely suited for the
evaluation of the clustering of social and biological conditions in vulnerable populations, we will investigate
reasons for the persistently high risk of CVD among PWH. With the team’s interdisciplinary expertise in HIV,
CVD and syndemics, our study is designed to understand how social, economic and biological factors combine
in PWH, contributing to their high CVD risk. We will leverage comprehensive electronic health record (EHR)
data from Kaiser Permanente (KP) and detailed existing survey and biospecimen from the KP Research Bank
(KPRB). In Aim 1, we will examine synergistic relationships with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)
among 29,000 PWH and 1:20 matched people without HIV (PWoH) enrolled in KP from 2000-2021. We will
evaluate clusters of social and biological factors available in EHRs such as mental health, substance use
disorders (SUD), neighborhood deprivation, and insurance benefits. For Aim 2, we will perform a
complementary study within the KPRB to identify synergistic relationships with subclinical CVD among 1,969
PWH (709 with biospecimens) and 1:1 matched PWoH. We will consider additional social factors from surveys
that may impact CVD risk, including discrimination and stigma, social isolation, emotional and practical health
support, and economic factors. Finally, Aim 3 will involve recruitment of 60 PWH from high-risk clusters
identified in Aims 1 and 2 for in-depth qualitative interviews to explore how the syndemic conditions contribute
to the high CVD risk. The interviews will inform a follow-up survey of 350 PWH recruited from the same high-
risk clusters, to confirm syndemic conditions in a larger sample that could be addressed in future CVD
prevention efforts. Integrating quantitative and qualitative data sources, this study has great potential to inform
future comprehensive community- and health system-level interventions to reduce the CVD burden in PWH."
10891401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During the last few decades, the development of novel and powerful statistical tools as well as increasing access
to low-cost, high-speed computing have made significant impacts on cancer research. Consequently, an
expanded and critical role has emerged for statisticians to collaborate in the investigative process, and more
importantly, a higher and more rigorous standard has been established and accepted widely in the definition
of scientific evidence. Notably, the rapid advances in genetics and genomics through large-scale molecularly
targeted approaches to personalized medicine have presented new challenges in experimental design and data
analysis. For example, next-generation sequencing and high-density genotyping generate complex high-
dimensional datasets for hypothesis generation and inferential testing. Such rich datasets pose fundamental
challenges in study design, data analysis, and results interpretation due to the large number of hypothesis tests,
gene pathway effects, and complex gene-gene interactions.
The Biostatistics Core will collaborate and consult with SPORE investigators on study design and data analysis
of the proposed studies to ensure the translational research will satisfy high scientific standards for statistical
rigor. The requested funding will provide biostatistical support to pre-clinical experiments in cell lines and animal
models, biospecimen studies for correlative analysis, and clinical trials in Projects 1-3 as well as new studies in
the Developmental Research Program (DRP) and Career Enhancement Program (CEP). In particular,
the Biostatistics Core is a dedicated facility to provide ready and specialized access to a broad range of statistical
expertise and data-related services.
1. Statistical expertise for the design, planning and conduct of animal experiments and human studies. Sample
size considerations are critical in clinical trials as well as biospecimen studies using blood and tissue collected
retrospectively and prospectively. Prospective study design includes interim monitoring plans and early stopping
rules in early phase trials. 2. Statistical expertise for data analysis and interpretation of animal experiments and
human studies. Data analysis plans for human subjects include the identification and validation of biomarkers in
retrospective and prospective studies. 3. Database consultation on (a) forms design, including variable
definitions and coding conventions (b) database specifications, including variable and output formats (c) quality
control and audit processes. 4. Computing facilities and resources for statistical and database requirements,
including data transfer, merging, sharing, and security. The SPORE projects may require transfer and merging
of clinical, pathologic and molecular data from different databases and laboratories, while maintaining
confidentiality of personal identifiers and protected health information."

Dr. Pulcini proposes a five-year research training program to support his development into an independent
physician-scientist dedicated to improving emergency care of children with medical complexity, which account
for approximately 20% of all pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and 33% of all healthcare spending
among children. Dr. Pulcini’s project goal is to optimize and implement a user-centered emergency care
planning tool to improve outcomes for infants with medical complexity (notably those in rural areas), a
particularly vulnerable subset of this patient population. Under the first aim of the proposal, Dr. Pulcini will
optimize an existing emergency care planning tool that, despite advocacy for children with medical complexity
by two professional societies, has been poorly implemented to date. Dr. Pulcini will optimize the emergency
care planning tool for infants with medical complexity through iterative semi-structured and targeted interviews
and surveys of tool users: providers, local interdisciplinary collaborators, and families. Under the second aim,
Dr. Pulcini will design and conduct a randomized feasibility trial of the user-centered emergency care planning
tool’s implementation, measuring resultant emergency health care outcomes. As part of the trial
implementation process, Dr. Pulcini will monitor barriers to implementation, as well as measure key emergency
health service research measures with plans for cost-effectiveness analysis for a full-scale future randomized
controlled trial to be submitted as an R01.
Dr. Pulcini’s training program is focused on dissemination and implementation (D&I) science, supplemented
with training in clinical trials and health services measure development. The training in D&I science builds upon
Dr. Pulcini’s previous training in pediatric emergency medicine and maternal and child health. Dr. Pulcini’s
research will be supported by an accomplished group of mentors with expertise in D&I science, clinical trials,
pediatric emergency medicine and health services research. His mentors are dedicated to ensuring his career
development into an independent clinical investigator through successful conduct of the proposed project and
training plan. By providing Dr. Pulcini with the skills and mentored experience necessary to complete this
proposal, he will be well positioned to succeed as an independent scientist and significantly improve the
emergency care of children with medical complexity."

The incidence of human papillomavirus associated (HPV+) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)
is rising in the US, and is now even more prevalent than cervical cancer. Due to low HPV vaccination rates
and the decades long latency period between HPV infection and cancer diagnosis, HPV+ OPSCC remains a
major health concern, with the most likely reason for death being distant metastasis. Furthermore, due to the
life-long detrimental treatment effects on quality of life for survivors, it is essential to identify a subset of
patients who would benefit from de-escalated treatment. Our long term goal is to differentiate HPV+ patients
who have a good prognosis and are most likely to benefit from de-escalated therapy and those who require the
standard, or a more aggressive regimen. Our group first characterized two main subtypes of HPV+ OPSCC,
identifying HPV integration into the host genome as the driving factor in determining tumor subtype.
Furthermore, we and others have shown that HPV integration status is associated with overall survival.
In this proposal we plan to study three downstream effects of HPV integration identified by our group and
others: an increase in the splicing of HPV oncogene E6 to E6*, a decrease in the tumor immune response, and
a change in cell differentiation status. Each of these effects plays a role in determining metastasis and
survival, however the mechanism of their effect and their relative contributions remain unclear. In aim 1, we will
disentangle the above three effects of HPV integration on overall and disease-specific survival using a
University of Michigan cohort of 300 patients, and we will compare methods for defining HPV integration
status. We will also optimize a biomarker for tumor immune infiltration based on H&E slides. In aim 2, we will
examine the oncogenic effects of the shift to expressing the shorter E6* isoform instead of full length E6, using
in vitro and in vivo models. This was observed by us and others to increase oxidative phosphorylation and
potentially tumor mutational burden. Finally, in aim 3 we will use in vitro and vivo models to examine
mechanism by which HPV integration and/or the shift to E6* expression modulate cell invasion and treatment
response. Based on our results, we will begin one or more biomarker-based pilot phase II clinical trials."

The goal of PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) is to provide investigators with
standard measurement protocols (e.g., questionnaires, bioassays, physical measurements) to improve the
quality and consistency of data collection and increase the impact of individual studies. Over time, this
common currency will enable investigators to more easily combine studies to increase statistical power and
compare studies to validate findings. Enabling analysis of shared data should lead to a better understanding
of the etiology, progression, and treatment of human disease, ultimately leading to improvements in patient
care, health outcomes and quality of life. To this end, PhenX has established a freely available, Web-based
catalog (https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) of measurement protocols intended for use in genomic, clinical,
translational, and epidemiological research with human participants. The PhenX Toolkit content and
features are driven by the scientific community. The PhenX Steering Committee (SC) provides overarching
guidance and each measurement protocol in the PhenX Toolkit is selected by a Working Group (WG) of
experts using a consensus-based process that relies on input from the scientific community. Initially
released in 2009, the PhenX Toolkit currently includes 874 protocols addressing human phenotypes and
exposures. In the next 5 years, PhenX will expand the breadth and depth of the Toolkit, increase utility, and
strive to increase awareness of the resource. The Specific Aims are to (1) review, update, and expand
PhenX Toolkit content; (2) leverage biomedical standards to increase scientific impact of PhenX Toolkit;
and (3) raise awareness and increase adoption of the PhenX Toolkit. This research plan will establish the
PhenX Toolkit as a sustainable knowledgebase that organizes, accumulates, and annotates standard
protocols and links them to relevant resources and data. This plan, which reflects a multipronged approach,
will ensure that the value and impact of the PhenX Toolkit will continue to increase over time."
10894082,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. It develops in a
sequential progression of a carcinogenic cascade from pre-cancerous metaplasia to cancerous dysplasia and
adenocarcinoma. However, oncogenic drivers or master regulators which lead to carcinogenic transition
between pre-cancerous and cancerous stages are uncertain. Previous investigations have noted that Kras
activity is observed in up to 40% of patients with gastric cancer and have suggested that Ras activation in
gastric cancer may promote the progression of metaplasia toward dysplasia and cancer. Our previous results
described that Kras activation in chief cells can rapidly develop metaplasia and invasive metaplasia with
dysplastic glands. These studies therefore imply that Kras activation might be a driving factor of gastric
carcinogenesis and chief cells might be an origin of gastric cancer. However, there is a clear knowledge gap
as to whether Kras activation is a critical oncogenic driver which controls the carcinogenic process of dysplasia
to adenocarcinoma. Also, while roles of Sox transcription factor activation following the oncogenic Kras
activation have been well-studied in other GI tract cancers, no studies have addressed whether such activities
are important for metaplasia development or are associated with Ras activation in gastric carcinogenesis.
We have therefore hypothesized that Kras activation is a driver of gastric carcinogenesis and metaplastic
development and progression can be controlled by upregulation of Sox9 as a downstream effector of Kras
signaling pathway. We propose two specific aims to elucidate a deeper understanding of cellular mechanisms
and events of gastric carcinogenesis using a novel inducible driver mouse model, which is a stomach- and
chief cell-specific driver mouse allele. First, we will define the oncogenic roles of Kras activation and the
lineage contribution of active Kras-induced cells during gastric carcinogenesis. Second, we will assess
functional roles of Sox9 transcription factor as a putative master regulator of metaplasia development and
progression. Our proposed study will not only define the cells of origin for gastric cancer, but also determine
the oncogenic potential and regulatory mechanisms of Kras activation during gastric cancer development.
Consequently, our results from this proposed study would provide insights in pre-clinical information to design
therapeutic interventions or to identify novel druggable targets by regulating transcriptional regulation of key
factors in patients with gastric cancer."
10894085,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The extent and relevance of admixture between human populations has remained one of the most hotly
debated questions in human genomics. Recent studies have revealed that admixture between diverged
populations has been a recurring feature of human evolution. However, despite the ubiquity of admixture in
humans, it is typically not accounted for in population genomic studies of natural selection. This project will
utilize ancient and modern human genetic variation data as well as reconstructed ancient microbiomes and
pathogens to learn about the evolutionary consequences of mixing between human populations. First, this
project will develop a novel statistical method that can detect genomic footprints of genetic adaptation
(selective sweeps) in admixed ancient DNA, as well as estimate the selection coefficient and beneficial allele
trajectory. This will allow us to accurately quantify and utilize adaptation signatures across different temporal
samples and investigate the confounding effect of past admixture on selection signatures in modern samples.
Further, we will contrast a model of homogeneous selection with a model of intense selection during the Out-
of-Africa (OoA) migration event to explore if adaptation to colder European environments might have been a
prerequisite to the OoA expansion. Second, we will evaluate the robustness of methods for detecting archaic
adaptive introgression in modern human data, by examining an alternative hypothesis of passive genetic
hitchhiking of archaic segments with mutations that originated in modern humans. This will allow a more
accurate interpretation of introgression signatures in modern genetic variation data. Third, we will sequence
archaeological skeletal samples from the ancient Levant that are bracketing a major historical event, the Late
Bronze Age Collapse, which is characterized by extensive migration and cultural turnover. This study will
provide important insights into the extent to which such a major admixture event was associated with changes
in population size, health-related parameters of the microbiome, and the appearance of novel pathogens.
Finally, we will develop a novel selection inference approach for modern admixed populations based on the
Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). Using the ARG for population genetic inference promises to boost
power compared to previous approaches and will allow us to accurately estimate the onset of selection.
Knowledge of the onset of selection aids our understanding of possible selective pressures in cases where no
ancient DNA of an ancestral pre-admixture population is available. In conclusion, the insights from this grant
will be critical to our understanding of the evolutionary origin of human adaptations and the health implications
of historical population admixture. The novel methods that we will develop will lead to an unprecedented level
of resolution regarding the origin of genomic segments and mutations and when and why they had been
selected. These insights will increase our ability to interpret individual genomic introgression and admixture
profiles and thus contribute to the advancement of personalized genomic medicine."
10894087,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibody recognition of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein is hindered by the densely-packed host glycans
that coat the surface of Env. Antibodies that interact with Env glycans have the potential to develop broad HIV-
1 reactivity and neutralization. However, host glycans are poorly immunogenic, presenting a challenge for
eliciting glycan-reactive neutralizing antibodies. In the first term of our grant, we defined a new type of
neutralizing HIV-1 antibody that bound the glycans that shield the HIV-1 envelope. These antibodies were
isolated from multiple vaccinated macaques and simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques.
Distinct from known glycan-dependent HIV-1 antibodies, these antibodies exhibited the ability to form I-shaped
and Y-shaped IgG molecules, and bound to glycans via a deep cavity formed by the heavy chain variable
region. We termed this type of antibody Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG) antibodies, since the dimerization of the
Fabs generated the I-shaped conformation. Vaccine-induced FDG antibodies broadly neutralize HIV-1 when
the virus glycosylation is restricted to Man9GlcNAc2–these are termed Type I FDG antibodies. Type II FDG
antibodies are similar to Type I, except they do not require Man9GlcNAc2 enrichment for neutralization of the
autologous virus that initiated the antibody lineage. Additionally, Type III FDG antibodies from infected
macaques bind to more glycosylation sites than Type I vaccine-induced FDG antibodies, and exhibit broad
HIV-1 neutralizing activity irrespective of the type of glycan present on HIV-1 envelope. The scientific premise
of this work is that the development of FDG antibody HIV-1 neutralization breadth is dependent upon antibody
recognition of multiple Env glycosylation sites, and antibody recognition of diverse glycans at each Env
glycosylation site. The goal of this study will be to guide antibody affinity maturation and selection from Type I
FDG antibodies to Type III FDG antibodies. We have designed structural and antigenic mimics of the
glycosylated region of Env targeted by these antibodies, and arrayed 24 copies of this glycopeptide on a
protein nanoparticle. We propose to isolate FDG antibodies from vaccinated macaques whose serum suggests
their antibodies are developing into Type III broadly neutralizing FDG antibodies (Aim 1); determine the
common genetic or biochemical features between Type I and Type III FDG antibodies that contribute to the
development of neutralization breadth (Aim 2); and elicit Type III FDG antibodies in macaques with Env
minimal immunogen nanoparticles (Aim 3). This work is significant because it will define a path for reproducibly
eliciting HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, and it will define promiscuous glycan recognition as the
mechanism by which neutralization breadth occurs for FDG antibodies. This approach would have great impact
on the field as it will demonstrate an alternative vaccine approach for the induction of HIV-1 bnAbs that does
not require targeting and shepherding rare precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies."

 Child maltreatment is associated with health risk behaviors carrying high personal and societal costs,
such as substance use and sexual risk behavior.1–4 Placement of children into out-of-home care aims to
mitigate these negative effects.5 Findings about rates of health risk behavior among youth in out-of-home care
are mixed,6–16 although studies show that young adults formerly in care have heightened levels of health risk
behavior.17–20 These mixed findings may be due to the fact that most studies test effects of placement across
childhood on later health risk behaviors. However, placement during adolescence may be a turning point that
redirects trajectories of health risk behavior. Adolescence is a period of rapid change and a typical period for
initiation of these behaviors,21 and adolescents have more difficulties adjusting to placement than do younger
children.22 To test whether adolescent placement acts as a turning point, it is important to know whether
placement initiates long-term changes in trajectories, short-term (time-specific) changes, or both. To design
interventions, it is also necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying placement effects. However,
because placement may occur at various points across time, identifying its direct and mediated effects requires
modeling out-of-home placement, mediators, confounders, and outcomes as time-varying variables.
 Importantly, out-of-home placement is a nonrandom event, and many pre-placement variables likely
predict both placement and subsequent health risk behavior. To deal with this threat to causal inference, recent
research has utilized propensity score methods.23–27 However, these methods cannot accommodate time-
varying variables, precluding tests of placement as a turning point or tests of its time-specific mediators.
 Accordingly, the proposed study uses two modern methods for causal inference, inverse probability of
treatment weighting (IPTW) and g-estimation, to test direct and mediated effects of placement on health risk
behaviors across time. These methods can account for biases from observed confounders and accommodate
time-varying variables.28,29 Aim 1 tests whether adolescents with out-of-home placement since the prior wave
show short-term, time-specific increases in substance use and initiation of unprotected sex, compared to those
who remain in-home. Aim 2 tests whether adolescent placement predicts longer-term elevations in adult health
risk behavior. Aim 3 tests time-varying mediators of the effect of placement on adult health risk behavior.
These aims will be tested in a national sample of 738 maltreated youth (age 11-14 at baseline) studied across
four waves to adulthood. The training plan brings together a distinguished mentoring team to provide
multidisciplinary training in child welfare system research, modern quantitative methods for causal inference,
developmental psychopathology of health risk behaviors, implications for intervention and policy, and
professional development. This will provide the applicant with the foundation to launch a research career
studying the effects of placement and child welfare involvement on adolescents' developmental outcomes."

The goal of this proposal is to develop expert panels focused on curating evidence for the clinical application of
somatic mutations associated with childhood cancers. Tumors in the pediatric population have unique genetic
profiles that can affect their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. There is currently a gap in representation
of somatic variants for childhood tumors in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. New
approaches for evidence curation are needed to identify important mutations in childhood cancers for both
diagnosis and therapy response. To address these gaps, our application builds on two prominent
developments in the field led by our team. First, as the ClinGen Somatic Clinical Domain Working Group
(CDWG) we developed the Minimal Variant Level Data (MVLD) standard to promote sharing and use of gene
variants in precision oncology. Second, we developed the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)
expert crowdsourced platform for somatic curation and clinical interpretation. Our goals are to: (1)
systematically catalog the clinical relevance of common, rare, and novel variants identified through
gene-specific and genome-scale testing in childhood cancers; (2) partner with ClinGen, ClinVar,
guideline-setting professional organizations, and other relevant global efforts to translate and present the
knowledge derived from genome researchers and clinical laboratories; and (3) develop informatics support for
variant assessment of clinical actionability, information display, interfacing with relevant databases, and
dissemination. To accomplish these goals we developed a collaboration over the past three years through the
ClinGen Somatic CDWG among researchers at Washington University, Georgetown University, and Children’s
Hospital Los Angeles that includes clinical and molecular geneticists, genetic counselors, bioinformaticians,
and genomic database experts to advance the use of genomic data in childhood cancers. Specifically, we will
establish pilot variant curation expert panels (VCEPs) to assess clinical relevance and actionability of somatic
variants in pediatric cancers. Our initial focus will be on two disease areas, with timely relevance, pediatric
malignancies with NTRK fusions and BCR-ABL1 (Philadelphia)-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like B-ALL).
We will adopt ClinGen’s existing VCEP policies and processes for assessing variants of strong clinical
significance, potential clinical significance, unknown clinical significance, and benign or likely benign variants in
childhood cancers. We will adapt and enhance the CIViC platform to support these expert panels. The CIViC
platform will also provide the curated evidence in standard formats for exchange of data with ClinVar and
ClinGen resources. Finally, we will seek FDA recognition for the evidence repository developed and curated
through this grant."

A major challenge in neuroscience is to uncover how defined neural circuits in the brain encode, store, modify, and retrieve information. Adding to this challenge is the fact that neural function does not operate in isolation but rather within living, behaving animals. Great technological advances over the past decades have allowed researchers to begin to optically measure and modulate neural activity but these approaches are often limited to head-fix animals when studying neural function at spatial and temporal scales relevant to internal neural circuit dynamics. While a great deal of scientific and technological progress has been made, there is still much to learn concerning complex neural function, especially within the context of natural behavior. This knowledge gap, at least in part, is due to a lack of accessible tools for simultaneously modulating and observing large-scale neural circuits with single-cell precision in freely behaving animals. This project will fill this gap by developing open-source, head-mounted miniature microscopes with spatiotemporal illumination capabilities for both patterned photo-stimulation and improved neural imaging in freely behaving animals. We will develop a modular control and acquisition platform for native integration of neural and behavioral equipment to facilitate neural-behavioral experiments. Finally, this platform will be driven by a novel, automated, closed-loop processing framework for detecting, decoding, and manipulating neural and behavioral dynamics in real-time. The goal of this platform is to 1) significantly extend and improve upon current freely behaving neural imaging and modulation techniques and 2) provide an integrated framework for observing, controlling, and manipulating neural dynamics within the context of behavior. This approach has the potential to simultaneously “read” from and “write” into, potentially, any area of the brain, enabling fine-grained investigation of the causal role between neural activity and behavior. Our development will be guided by concurrent benchtop and in vivo testing at every stage of the development and optimization process. To maximize the impact of our efforts, all tools and technologies developed for this proposal will be open-source and shared widely with the scientific community through online resources and technical workshops."

MIDUS has unprecedented opportunities to advance knowledge of risk and protective factors for cognitive
decline as well as for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD). Such potential stems from its
comprehensive assessments from two national samples (Core, Refresher) of behavioral, social, psychological,
and biological assessments from prior decades in the participants’ lives. Identifying markers of risk before
disease symptomatology is foremost to AD/ADRD prevention science. Key aims are to: (1) Conduct additional
waves of cognitive assessments on both national samples and obtain new measures focused on cognitive
impairment. The Brief Test of Adult Cognition will be re-administered to ~ 4,000 adults (Core n = 2,062; Refresher
n = 1,935), ages 25 to 95 at the last wave with key neuropsychological assessments of memory, speed, fluency,
reasoning, and executive functioning. Global cognitive status will be assessed with the Telephone Interview for
Cognitive Status and self-reported symptoms. (2) Conduct additional waves of emotion-related functional
neuroimaging and psychophysiological assessments on Core and Refresher Neuroscience subsamples and
obtain comprehensive measures of brain aging. Multimodal neuroimaging and psychophysiological data will be
collected on ~ 450 adults (Core n = 215 longitudinal + 60 new; Refresher n = 115 longitudinal + 60 new).
Longitudinal analyses will examine changes in affective chronometry of emotional processes, computed brain
age, atrophy, white matter structural integrity and hyperintensities, microstructural complexity of dendrites and
axons, and network connectivity and modularity. (3) Quantify AD and neurovascular disease burden and collect
new ADRD-related plasma and neuropsychological measures and clinical assessments in the Biomarker
subsamples. Conduct advanced molecular amyloid PET to identify individuals exhibiting amyloid accumulation
indicative of AD neuropathic change, and neurovascular MRI to identify vascular diseases including vessel
stiffness and oligemic tissue perfusion. Cross-validate plasma markers of amyloid beta (42/40) against amyloid
imaging in participants who have both, and in conjunction with the MIDUS U19 collect aβ42/aβ40, p-tau181,
ptau217, total tau, and neurofilament light (NFL) on the full biomarker samples (~ 1280 participants; Core n = 630;
Refresher n = 647), thereby extending the reach of MIDUS to include ADRD biomarkers. In conjunction with the
U19 application, these new measures will be used to test hypotheses regarding cognitive decline and the
precursors of AD/ADRD and neurovascular disease via cumulative stress over 30 years and consider
socioeconomic and race disparities and resilience. The protective influence of biopsychosocial
resources, affective style, and lifestyle factors assessed over multiple prior waves of MIDUS will be examined
in relation to early indicators to gain a better understanding of the relations of these factors to cognitive
impairment and dementia. These new assessments and analyses offer ground-breaking science on mechanisms
to advance prevention, including development of interventions and treatments for aging declines and dementia."
10894237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain is still a clinical diagnosis based on location, symptom report, and clinical expertise. Despite recent
efforts to delineate specific and evidence-based criteria to diagnose different chronic pain conditions, substantial
heterogeneity persists among chronic pain patients often within the same clinical pain syndrome (e.g., low-back
pain). The lack of quantitative and reliable measures to diagnose chronic pain and the related heterogeneity
that ensues are major obstacles to medical care for patients and for research studies. Chronic pain patients are
often managed using a “trial and error” approach as targeted and precise treatment is not possible without
quantitative biomarkers, like glucose levels for diabetes. In addition, patient-related variability in analgesic
response is thought to be one of the main reasons why the current therapeutic interventions for chronic pain are
unsatisfactory, as 20% of US adults live in chronic pain and 8% of US adults are disabled from chronic pain.
Natural language processing analyzes semantic and emotional content, syntactic structure, and complexity of
speech; audio-visual processing analyzes voice acoustics and facial expressions. These tools have recently
been shown to be powerful quantitative and reliable biomarkers for discriminating between patients with
psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and major depression, and in predicting long-term outcomes, like the
development of psychosis in high-risk groups. A parallel can be drawn between chronic pain and chronic mental
illness like major depressive disorder, as both conditions are diagnosed based on subjective report of symptoms,
diagnostic criteria, and clinical expertise. In addition, both conditions are closely associated with negative affect
which has been corroborated by preclinical research and brain imaging data showing a critical role of the limbic
brain in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Therefore, it stands to reason that natural language and audio-
visual processing may serve as biomarkers to phenotype different types of chronic pain patients and to measure
patients' responses to treatment.
This proposal will study the ability of language analysis and audio-visual processing tools in discriminating
between different types of patients with chronic pain (i.e., discriminant validity) in Aim1, and the ability of these
tools to predict analgesic response of chronic low-back pain (CLBP) patients receiving spinal cord stimulation
(SCS) (i.e., predictive validity) in Aim 2. In both aims patients will be video recorded during an interview where
they speak about their pain or mood (for major depressive disorder patients). Language, speech, and facial
expression features will be extracted from the recordings and used in multivariate machine learning models. In
Aim 1 natural language and audio-visual processing patterns will be compared between patients with 3
conditions: (1) musculoskeletal CLBP, (2) musculoskeletal CLBP with clinically significant negative affect, and
(3) moderate major depressive disorder. In Aim 2, natural language and audio-visual processing patterns will be
used to identify responders and non-responders to SCS."

Survivors of sudden and violent deaths, such as those that occurred on 9/11, are at higher risk for prolonged
grief disorder (PGD), in response to both that death and subsequent deaths. Despite World Trade Center
Health Registry (WTCHR) Survivors’ high rates of knowing someone who died on 9/11, there has been
minimal study of bereavement, trauma, and grief and their effects on health-related quality of life (HRQoL),
including cognitive functioning, in this population while accounting for the effects of gender, race, and ethnicity.
This proposal will first determine grief severity and the presence of self-reported threshold PGD in a
representative sample of English- and Spanish-speaking WTCHR Survivors. Study findings will provide a
greater understanding of grief severity/PGD among gender, ethnic, and racial groups and help to ensure that
public health efforts reflect the needs of the diverse WTCHR Survivor community.
This proposal will also examine the associations between bereavement and trauma with current grief severity,
including PGD. Using existing WTCHR data regarding 9/11-related bereavement and trauma and newly-
collected information pertaining to subsequent bereavement and trauma, as well as current grief, we will
examine the complex inter-relationships among these variables to outline pathways of risk. We will also
examine the impact of grief and these factors on HRQoL by determining how risk pathways and associations
described above (bereavement burden, trauma burden, grief severity/PGD) extend to HRQoL, while also
taking into account the effects of physical and mental health burden. As bereavement has been associated
with impairment in various cognitive functions that affect daily functioning which have also been associated
with quality of life, and cognitive impairments have been associated with WTC-exposure, we plan to assess
cognitive difficulties as an additional aspect of HRQoL. The last aim of this project addresses reports that
treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorder have not been readily available or accessed by
WTCHR participants. Therefore, we will determine the extent to which individuals who are at risk for PGD are
ready and able to access grief support within the community, and are satisfied with the support they receive.
This proposal brings together an experienced multidisciplinary team of collaborators from the Center for the
Study of Traumatic Stress at Uniformed Services University, the Center for Prolonged Grief at Columbia
University, the WTCHR, and Voices of September 11, Inc., which has an established history, familiarity, and
rapport with the 9/11 survivor community, as well as established working relationships with one another."
10893920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Violence in the United States is the third leading cause of death
for young people (aged 10 to 24 years), and violent acts have immediate, enduring, and
disturbing impacts on individuals, families, and communities. Youth violence is a problem in
other countries in our hemisphere as well, and one area of particular concern is Central
America. For the past nearly eight years, our research team has been working with partners
across Central America to develop Miles de Manos (MdM; “Thousands of Hands”), a universal,
multi-modal, evidence-informed and community-based youth violence prevention intervention.
MdM has been widely disseminated throughout the region, and has been adopted as a key
component of the national education plans of Honduras and El Salvador, despite the lack of an
evidence base demonstrating its effectiveness. This project proposes a randomized controlled
trial in Honduras, conducted in collaboration with the Honduran Secretary of Education and
ChildFund International, experienced in-country experts in the implementation of MdM through
work funded by USAID. The aims of the proposed project are:
Aim 1. To examine the effectiveness of a culturally specified youth violence prevention
program on improving effective parent and teacher behavior management practices and
reducing both youth problem behaviors and youth association with peers and adults
involved in problem behaviors.
Aim 2. To investigate potential mediators of any outcomes due to the intervention, and
specifically to conduct a test of the social learning theory underlying the intervention.
Aim 3. To investigate potential moderators of any outcomes due to the intervention.
Potential benefits of the project include filling in gaps in knowledge about community-based
violence prevention programs both in Honduras and the U.S. Finding effective ways to improve
the health, safety, and social cohesion of community members has the potential to benefit both
countries in numerous ways, including reducing the personal and social disruptions and traumas
that come from living in and leaving communities that become marked by violence."

Summary
Our focus will be on two separate, but related goals. The first goal will be to maintain our
compliance with the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) and to improve our
processes under the AFRPS standards by developing policies and procedures, strengthening
collaborations, and conducting program self-assessment to maintain and improve conformance
with the standards. The second goal will be to implement the PCAF regulations at the Iowa
Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. This will require reviewing (and possibly
revising) our current code and laws to make them conform to the PCAF regulation, training
inspectors on the requirements (and developing a training program so that future inspectors will
continue to be adequately trained), and developing and conducting an Out Reach program to
help producers to understand their responsibilities under the new regulation. Meeting these
combined goals will help the Commercial Feed and Fertilizer Bureau to protect public health by
having policies and procedures in place resulting in a high quality animal feeds regulatory
program."
10894052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity in recent decades has made obesity one of the
greatest public health challenges of the modern world. It is estimated that by 2030, 33% and 50% of US
children ages 6-11 and 12-19 years, respectively, will be overweight or obese. Environmental exposures in
utero and during postnatal periods of heightened susceptibility may increase risk of obesity and adversely
impact cardiometabolic health. Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are additive flame retardants and plasticizers
that are extensively used worldwide after the phase-out of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The
ubiquitous use of OPEs has resulted in almost all pregnant women having OPE exposures and children having
a higher body burden compared to adults. OPEs interfere with well-recognized biological pathways contributing
to the development of obesity and cardiometabolic health, including disruption of: 1) thyroid hormones; 2) sex
steroid hormones; and 3) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors as well as inducing 4) chronic low-grade
inflammation. Toxicological studies indicate OPEs increase lipid accumulation, disrupt metabolic function, and
impair glucose tolerance, supporting their role as potential obesogenic and metabolism-disrupting chemicals.
Epidemiological studies report increased odds of being overweight and obese as well as higher waist
circumference, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, no longitudinal study in
humans has examined repeated OPE measures in early life and their association with adiposity and
cardiometabolic health in adolescence, which is a significant data gap. This proposed application will capitalize
on resources of the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study to be among the very
first to examine whether early life OPEs are associated with adiposity and cardiometabolic health measures in
adolescence, including BMI and waist circumference z-scores, fat-mass index, body fat %, blood pressure,
fasting glucose, serum lipids, adiponectin, and leptin, using a prospective study design. We will additionally
measure novel cardiometabolic intermediates, including high molecular weight adiponectin, glycoprotein
acetyls (GlycA), irisin, vaspin, and lipoprotein particles, as well as biomarkers of inflammation. We will use
Quantile g-computation (Q-gcomp) and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to examine complex
OPE mixtures to determine the individual and joint effects of OPEs on adiposity and cardiometabolic profiles in
adolescence. We will use data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC)
Study, a pan-Canadian cohort, to validate findings from the HOME Study. We will generate novel findings on
whether early life OPEs are obesogenic and metabolism-disrupting chemicals during adolescence and identify
potential windows of susceptibility. Given the ubiquity of OPEs and the global burden of obesity and type 2
diabetes, the findings will be highly valuable for environmental policy making and exposure reduction."
10894035,"Project Summary
Maternal stress is associated with children’s risk for obesity controlling for socioeconomic status, yet standard
of care child obesity prevention programs have not focused on maternal stress reduction. The association
between maternal stress and child obesity is particularly strong in Latino families, whose children also have the
highest rates of obesity in the United States. A mindful parenting program might reduce Latina mothers’
psychological stress and lead to improved parenting practices and ability to create a healthier environment.
The primary objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention
that integrates mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindful parenting in a population whose children are at
highest risk for obesity: Latina mothers. Phase 1 of the research involves developing and refining an integrative
intervention manual, titled ATIENDE (Awareness Training to Influence Eating, Nutrition, Decision-making, and
Exercise) and translating it into Spanish. Phase 2 involves conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing the
ATIENDE intervention to an active control condition in 50 Latina mothers of elementary-school age children.
Participant satisfaction rates and qualitative interviews will provide evidence of the program’s acceptability.
Feasibility will be determined by examining recruitment rates, retention rates, and treatment fidelity.
Completion of this project will inform the development of a full-scale efficacy trial. This Mentored Patient-
Oriented Research Career Development Award builds upon the candidate’s experience and interest in
conducting parent-focused obesity prevention research. The proposed research and training activities will
provide the candidate with essential skills in the areas of: (1) intervention development; (2) trial design and
conduct; and (3) advanced statistical methods. Training in these domains will prepare the candidate to be an
independent investigator in the development and evaluation of parent mindfulness interventions to improve
child obesity-related outcomes and reduce health disparities."
10894038,"Patients who need long-term central venous catheters (CVCs) for chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition (TPN),
outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT), and other indications often maintain CVCs at home, with support
from home nursing and home infusion agencies. The market for home infusion therapy grows 8% a year, and currently
reaches 1.2 million patients yearly. Unlike in hospitals, home infusion therapy patients and their caregivers (i.e., family,
friends, neighbors, or even coworkers) perform day-to-day CVC care and infusion initiation after training by home
infusion or home health nurses. However, complications of home infusion therapy such as central line associated
bloodstream infections (CLABSI) have not been a focus of research or regulation. In fact, we do not currently have a
widely-accepted definition of CLABSI in home infusion therapy. Such a definition is urgently needed to perform
benchmarking and industry-wide quality initiatives. Furthermore, improved understanding how to perform this work in
home infusion therapy is needed. There is no CLABSI benchmark or reporting platform by which home infusion agencies
can compare their CLABSI rates with others. There is no centralized reporting platform. Meanwhile, while CLABSI
prevention toolkits are now standards of care in acute care hospitals, similar CLABSI prevention toolkits have not been
widely implemented in home infusion therapy. Evidence-based adaptations, such as training materials specifically
geared towards patients and informal caregivers, and specific advice on covering CVCs during bathing, have been
developed but not widely implemented. We have previously gathered stakeholders in healthcare epidemiology,
infection prevention, infusion nursing, and home infusion therapy using a modified Delphi approach to develop a pilot
home infusion CLABSI definition. Through a collaborative of five home infusion agencies in different regions of the
country, we will work, to validate and benchmark this new home infusion CLABSI definition, test the impact of feeding
benchmarked home infusion CLABSI data back to agencies on CLABSI rates, and implement a CLABSI prevention
maintenance toolkit in home infusion therapy. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims: (1) To
determine the validity of a candidate home infusion CLABSI surveillance definition and barriers to its implementation by
home infusion agencies, (2) To develop a benchmark for CLABSI rates in home infusion therapy patients and design and
implement a dashboard for dissemination of benchmarked rates, and (3) To adapt and implement an existing CLABSI
prevention toolkit for home infusion therapy and measure its impact on CLABSI rates in five home infusion agencies.
The major outcomes of this work will be (1) a validated home infusion CLABSI surveillance definition, (2) a benchmark
for home infusion CLABSI with a dashboard for dissemination of benchmarked rates, and (3) an understanding of the
impact of a CLABSI prevention toolkit on home infusion CLABSI rates."

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization globally. Viral
and bacterial LRTI present similarly, leading clinicians to overprescribe antibacterials for fear of missing a
lethal bacterial infection or superinfection. However, emerging data from global cohorts indicate that viral LRTI
is frequently more prevalent than bacterial LRTI in both children and adults. In low- or middle-income countries
(LMICs), antibacterial overuse for viral LRTI is often worse given limited diagnostic capacity. Access to point-
of-care (POC) diagnostic tests, which do not require laboratory infrastructure, may decrease antibacterial
overuse for LRTI in LMICs. Locally relevant, evidence-based, cost-effective diagnostic algorithms for LRTI
have not been systematically developed in LMICs. The objective of this proposal is to integrate multiple low-
cost diagnostic tools (clinical predictors, POC pathogen tests, and POC biomarker tests) to develop and
evaluate an LRTI diagnostic and treatment algorithm in a LMIC setting. We will use a large, existing, setting-
specific biorepository of patients with LRTI to guide algorithm development. The following aims are proposed:
1) create an evidence-based algorithm for LRTI management by integrating clinical predictors, POC pathogen
tests, and POC biomarker tests; 2) establish understanding, acceptability, and barriers to implementation of
clinical algorithms for LRTI management among local physicians; and 3) evaluate an LRTI management
algorithm in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial at a single hospital in a LMIC. We will complete gold-
standard testing and clinical adjudications of samples in our biorepository to identify etiology of infection. We
will then construct decision trees by inputting 1) clinical predictors, 2) POC pathogen tests, and 3) POC
biomarker tests to identify a potentially cost-effective algorithm that would reduce inappropriate antibacterial
prescriptions. We will conduct focus group discussions with local physicians to identify barriers and facilitators
to using clinical algorithms. Following algorithm development, we will reconvene focus groups to iterate on the
algorithm and to determine appropriate methods for communicating and implementing the algorithm. We will
then conduct a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial to evaluate the algorithm. Patients admitted with LRTI
will receive either 1) algorithm-directed care, or 2) usual care. To assess clinical outcomes and antibacterial
duration concurrently in this trial, we will use the innovative Response Adjusted for Duration of Antibiotic Risk
(RADAR) clinical trial design developed by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). The
expected outcome of this work is the development and evaluation of a LRTI diagnostic algorithm that uses
local evidence and integrates multiple low-cost diagnostic tools. The long-term goal of this work is to translate
these methods to other low-resource settings to combat the growing global crisis of antimicrobial resistance."

 The vector-borne spirochetes that cause relapsing fever are transmitted to humans by either ticks or human
body lice. Despite identification of the etiological agents of relapsing fever over 100 years ago, very little
information exists regarding their pathogenesis. Although relapsing fever is more common in developing
countries, tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) occurs in areas of the U.S. where Ixodes and Ornithodoros species of
ticks, the vectors for TBRF spirochetes, are endemic. During their natural enzootic cycle, vector-borne
spirochetes exist in two distinct niches found within the arthropod vector and the vertebrate. It is well
established that Lyme disease spirochetes must undergo significant changes in global gene expression to allow
them to adapt to these two diverse environments. Cyclic dinucleotide second messengers (e.g., c-di-GMP and
c-di-AMP) play key roles during the enzootic cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi, but their regulatory contributions in
TBRF spirochetes have not been investigated. We will test the role of the c-di-AMP signaling pathway in
promoting adaptation of TBRF spirochetes to the different host environments encountered during the bacterial
natural lifecycle. Because the c-di-AMP signaling pathway is found in all pathogenic Borrelia, findings from this
work also has the potential to provide insight into the function of this system in Lyme disease Borrelia. In
Specific Aim 1, we will inactivate individual components c-di-AMP signaling system in the TBRF spirochete,
Borrelia turicatae, and define their roles in messenger molecule production and general spirochetal physiology.
We will also study the regulation of individual pathway components and c-di-AMP synthesis. Specific Aims 2
and 3 will elucidate the impact of the c-di-AMP signaling system on global regulation, pathogenesis, and vector
colonization/transmission. These aims will provide critical knowledge regarding the regulatory networks that
control B. turicatae adaptation during transmission and infection and identify virulence determinants required
by the bacteria for host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interaction(s). Regulators and virulence factors
identified in this project represent potential targets against which future therapeutic interventions and/or
diagnostics for TBRF could be developed. Molecular characterization of the c-di-AMP-dependent signaling
system and c-di-AMP-regulated virulence determinants will be the focus of future R01 grant proposals."

advance the health of the U.S. population. Over the past five years, our program has trained 12 PPH informatics
researchers who are helping modernize the nation’s public health infrastructure and strengthen approaches to
managing and analyzing population health data. Building on these and other successes, including the
establishment of a vibrant and flourishing educational, institutional, and technical infrastructure to support these
trainees, we are now positioned to grow our program and its value as outlined in this application for competitive
renewal. The program continues to have two overarching goals: 1) train predoctoral and postdoctoral scientists
for successful careers in PPH informatics research; and 2) recruit and graduate high-caliber trainees with diverse
backgrounds, races/ethnicities, and research disciplines. Our program equips trainees with advanced data and
information science skills to address biomedical informatics research challenges in the context of public and
population health. Predoctoral trainees pursue a PhD in epidemiology, health policy and management, or
biostatistics with a doctoral minor in population health analytics. Postdoctoral trainees obtain further training that
includes a research-oriented master’s degree if they lack prior training in PPH informatics. The educational
program for all trainees consists of coursework; a substantial research project culminating in dissertation for PhD
students and thesis for master's students; purposeful mentorship and guidance in meeting training goals; and
associated publications, presentations, and other academic activities related to their research with expert faculty
mentors. In this next funding cycle, we propose to train a steady state of 9 predoctoral trainees and 5 postdoctoral
trainees, including two trainees focused on HIV research. Overall, we aim to build on our past successes by: 1)
expanding the number of trainees served by our program; 2) expanding coursework and research experiences
in the area of clinical informatics, including a focus on training HIV researchers who can apply PPH informatics
methods to enhance surveillance and care for people living with HIV; 3) improving coursework in the areas of
data science and analytics; and 4) expanding and achieving greater diversity among our faculty and trainees."

Inflammation is essential for tissue repair and removal of harmful pathogens and molecules , but if activated
inappropriately, the innate immune system triggers autoinflammatory conditions. Macrophages play a key role
in inflammation and have tremendous impact on human health, both positive and negative, yet many questions
about these cells remain unanswered. They are heterogeneous and adopt a spectrum of activation states, both
as distinct tissue-resident macrophages and in circulation as monocytes. The drivers of these activation states
remain elusive. Metabolism plays a role, with macrophages undergoing metabolic changes during pro-
inflammatory activation, including switching from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. However, whether
metabolism or other intracellular processes alone can dictate activation states remains unclear and is critical to
understanding a host of human diseases associated with inappropriate inflammation. The current proposed
research program addresses this question and significantly expands our previous work by analyzing these
processes in different organ systems (including the liver and the intestine).
We are leveraging the unique advantages zebrafish provide for exquisite genetic manipulations, high throughput
screening, and in vivo imaging to dissect the complex relationship between intracellular processes and
macrophage activation. The discovery of an inactivating mutation in a NOD-like receptor, nlrc3l, that causes
inappropriate macrophage activation and loss of microglia led us to create a new genetic screen in zebrafish that
yielded several novel macrophage mutations that we will investigate. These new mutations cause inappropriate
macrophage activation, disrupt microglia development or both. We are investigating whether nlrc3l and
associated genes as well as new genes we identify from the screen regulate macrophage activation by altering
metabolic and other intracellular processes. We are taking an integrated approach at multiple levels—using
differential transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, high power in vivo single cellular and whole-body
imaging, CRISPR based genetic engineering, protein-protein interactions, and cross-species
experimentations—to address these questions. Furthermore, our previous results raise critical new questions
regarding how activation states are regulated to ensure normal tissue macrophage development, and whether
common mechanisms exist to control macrophage activation across multiple organs. Our research program will
expand to address these key areas in vivo using a diverse set of tissue macrophages (microglia, intestinal
macrophages, and Kupffer cells). These studies aim to provide necessary insights into macrophage
differentiation, plasticity, and potential in a disease-relevant context, and address how seemingly disparate
functions (development and activation regulation) are encoded in the molecular program governing
macrophages. In summary, deciphering the molecular networks regulating immune activation is critical for
addressing health challenges associated with inappropriate inflammation, including diabetes, obesity, cancer,
and autoimmune diseases. Our research will lead to new knowledge and technologies needed to harness the
properties of macrophages for disease prevention and treatment."
10894041,"Project Summary/Abstract
Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of
experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately,
short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed
interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre-
operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four
weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the
surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of
accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care.
Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use
from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning
(ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to
synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will
leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts
who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic,
automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate
the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky
alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions.
Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes)
and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims
will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This
study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which
will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health
outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future
implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics."
10894042,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Germline PTEN mutations cause PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), a hereditary overgrowth and cancer
predisposition disorder. Besides being a classical tumor suppressor gene associated with cancer, PTEN mutations are one
of the most common causes of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental
delay (DD). However, it is not known which specific PHTS individual will develop ASD/DD, and importantly, whether all
children with PHTS and ASD/DD grow up to have identical cancer risks as non-ASD/DD PHTS. The broad over-arching
objective of this proposal is to systematically characterise the modifier landscape of individuals with PHTS in order to
ultimately shift current research and clinical practice paradigms from population-level probabilities towards more precise
individual-level disease risk probabilities. Based on the current knowledge gaps and proof-of-principle data, the central
hypothesis is that interactions of germline PTEN variation with other pertinent measurable biological factors, such as
germline genomic modifiers or metabolic differences, provide more precise risk estimates of ASD/DD and possibly,
comorbid cancer in PHTS at the individual level. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: (Aim 1) To
identify metabolomic markers of ASD/DD and cancer risk in PHTS patient-derived plasma and lymphoblastoid cell lines;
(Aim 2) To characterize genomic markers of ASD/DD and cancer risk in PHTS via multimodal phenotype-driven genomic
analyses including copy number variation analysis, family-based whole-genome sequencing, and genome-wide derivation
of polygenic risk scores; (Aim 3) To generate a predictive model of ASD/DD and cancer risk in PHTS including translational
methods to facilitate clinical adoption for individual patient risk stratification. This patient-focused research will rely on an
existing uniformly phenotyped PHTS cohort and continuing prospective accrual of individuals harboring germline PTEN
mutations. The proposed research aligns with the NICHD Priorities and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee
strategic plan for ASD in that the priority is (1) to understand genetic syndromes associated with ASD and the co-occurring
medical and mental health conditions associated with such disorders; (2) to identify reliable markers to predict for ASD
within PHTS in a timely manner, since earliest interventions lead to improved outcomes in ASD; (3) to understand the
biology of autism through investigating metabolomic and genomic markers and importantly, integrating these factors
through predictive model development. The proposed research is innovative because in addition to studying a monogenic
(less heterogeneous) and deeply/uniformly phenotyped group of individuals with PTEN-ASD/DD, this proposal goes
beyond observational epidemiological interrogation into investigating underlying metabolomic and genomic factors that
contribute first to altered ASD/DD and then comorbid cancer risks in individuals with ASD/DD. Upon conclusion, in
addition to discovery science, this application is projected to result in predictive methods that clinicians can adopt at the
point-of-care."

Radiopharmaceutical treatments with α-particles represent a promising approach to treat some tumors and
metastases. This modality leverages the short range of α-particles, up to tens of microns, to deliver radiation
only to cancer cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. To do so, an α-emitting radionuclide is bounded
to an affinitive ligand which is used to target biomolecules expressed in tumoral cells. Currently, here are several
clinical applications either approved, such as 223Ra for the treatment of bony metastases, or under investigation.
Particularly, α-RPT could be used for the treatment of high-risk pediatric neuroblastoma, whose prognosis keeps
poor. As the rationale behind radiopharmaceutical treatments is to exploit the differential amount of radiation
imparted to tumors and healthy tissue, a rigorous determination of radiation dosimetry and effects is requested
to develop this technique to their full extent. Starting with the study of α-particles in general, this research will be
oriented to the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma using the radiopharmaceutical [211At]MM4, which targets
the overexpression of PARP-1 proteins in these tumors. In general, the absorbed dose generally predicts the
biological or clinical effect of X-rays, γ or β radiation. However, heavy-particle-based radiations, such as α-
particles, deposit their energy in a much denser fashion and are capable to produce more concentrated damage
to biological structures as the DNA, which tends to impair the repair mechanisms of a cell. Microdosimetry is the
study of these patterns of interaction at the microscopic level and allows for a better determination of the effect
of α-particles than absorbed dose. The principal investigator has previously investigated methods to calculate
microdosimetric quantities for α-particles. Therefore, this project is structured as follows. First, those
microdosimetric calculations will be connected with actual damage to the DNA using the Monte Carlo toolkit
TOPAS and its extension for subcellular structures, TOPAS-nBio. Second, initial damage to neuroblastoma cell
lines will be studied using the affinity of [211At]MM4 for PARP-1 in these cell lines to create realistic sub-cellular
models of α-particle irradiation. Permanent damage after the occurrence of repair mechanisms will be also
modelled assessed through experimental data published by Dr. Makvandi’s group from the University of
Pennsylvania. Finally, biodistribution of radiopharmaceutical across organs and blood in animal models and
phantoms will be assessed and used to predict treatment outcomes. The principal investigator will use the
experience and expertise of his mentoring team (Dr. Harald Paganetti and Dr. Jan Schuemann) to learn the skills
and abilities necessary to accomplish the proposed research. He will also attend seminars, coursework and
conferences on radiobiology, Monte Carlo simulations and grant writing and leadership skills, which will ensure
a strong foundation for running an independent laboratory after this project."

 The COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigating measures have brought on tremendous financial hardship
for vulnerable Americans, with nearly 15% unemployment at its peak and millions falling into poverty. There
have been striking racial and socioeconomic disparities in these hardships, particularly for Black and Latinx
families, which build on longstanding inequities in income, housing, and other social determinants of health.
Recent research has demonstrated the impact of the pandemic and its resulting socioeconomic inequities on
disparities in mental health and healthcare utilization. It is increasingly recognized that policies play a role in
mitigating or exacerbating these disparities. For example, mandated closures lead to job and income loss,
which disproportionately affect low-income and minority women. Conversely, economic support policies ensure
that vulnerable families have the resources to stay healthy at home. While some studies have examined the
effects of state-level COVID-19-related policies, there has been little systematic documentation of county-level
policies and their effects on disadvantaged groups. The goal of this study is to leverage, expand upon, and link
existing national data sets to test the hypothesis that county-level public health and social policies have
affected disparities in mental health and healthcare utilization. In Aim 1, we will gather county-level COVID-19-
related policy data for 2020-2021 for a nationwide sample of 250 counties, selected to ensure coverage of over
half of the U.S. population as well as diversity in racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and urban/rural composition.
Policies will be drawn from online sources and grouped into 3 domains chosen due to likely impacts on mental
health and utilization: (1) containment and closure, (2) economic support, and (3) public health. We will
characterize geographic and temporal variation in county-level policies and make this database freely
available. In Aim 2, we will examine which county-level COVID-19-related policies contributed to or ameliorated
pandemic-related disparities in mental health and health behaviors, linking the policy database from Aim 1 with
national health surveys that provide individual-level data on self-reported psychological distress, smoking,
alcohol use, and illicit drug use. In Aim 3, we will estimate the association of county-level COVID-19-related
policies with disparities in healthcare utilization for mental health problems, linking the policy database from
Aim 1 with national data sets that provide individual-level data on healthcare utilization. Aims 2 and 3 exploit
temporal and geographic variation in county-level policies and employ quasi-experimental methods to estimate
policy effects. Conducted in close collaboration with other SBECCC investigators, the expected outcome of this
research is the creation of a county-level policy database that will serve as a valuable resource for researchers
and stakeholders working to understand how local policies contributed to and continue to influence pandemic-
related health disparities, as well as specific evidence on policy effects on mental health outcomes. This will
guide policies and interventions to reduce mental health burden especially for vulnerable communities."
10886402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Early detection of autism and delivery of evidence-based services are crucial because they can lessen the
degree of long-term disability associated with the condition. Black children however, continue to experience
disparities in access to services due, in part, to inaccurate screening, lack of referrals for autism evaluations,
and underrepresentation of culturally and linguistically diverse participants in research samples.
The proposed study will address important gaps in autism research. Few studies have been conducted to
understand the feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability of digital screening tools from the perspective of
culturally and linguistically diverse end-users. There is little knowledge of how the cultural appropriateness of
provider communication about screening results and clinical decision support influences Black caregivers’
decisions to link their child to services. Moreover, information on determinants of culturally and linguistically
diverse children’s recruitment and retention in autism studies is lacking. These gaps will be addressed in the
proposed study through three aims. The first aim is to describe acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of
communication about screening results to Black families within the context of clinical decision support. The
second aim will explore the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of a digital autism screener for Black
families. The third aim is to identify determinants of Black caregivers’ enrollment and continued engagement in
autism studies of digital screening tools.
Dr. Fannin is an investigator looking to expand her capacity for independent research. She has established an
interdisciplinary mentoring team with expertise in psychiatry, biology, education, and population health science.
Dr. Fannin’s career development plan capitalizes on the mentoring team’s guidance for selection of didactic
training and professional development to address gaps in research skills, as well as their individualized
mentoring to apply what she has learned to the research. The proposed research contributes to the knowledge
base concerning equitable identification and access to autism services, as well as strategies to help generalize
evidence-based intervention to culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Through examination of how
Black caregivers believe providers can customize screening procedures, improve conversations about
screening results, and promote study recruitment and retention, the resultant data can foster development of
culturally responsive clinical procedures to improve the quality of life for autistic children and their families."
10889001,"The Department of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania proposes continuation of its innovative T32-
spomsored Research Track Radiology Residency Program with the goal of developing imaging clinician-
scientists. The clinical and scientific importance of biomedical imaging, rapid progress in imaging technology,
and an increasing investment in imaging research create an ongoing and increasing need for imaging-based
clinician scientists to assure translation of these advances into human research and clinical practice. There
continues to be a talented pool of resident applicants to academic radiology residency programs across the US
but only a small fraction of programs equipped to fully train radiology clinician-investigators. The training
program described for this proposal continues the Penn radiology residency track designed for trainees
interested in careers as imaging scientists, leveraging a highly active program in imaging and image-guided
therapy and the large and well-developed research infrastructure within Penn's Radiology Department. The
Program specifically includes 1 year of research training during the 4th year of radiology residency and a
second optional research fellowship year undertaken in the context of an integrated radiology resident
experience that meets the requirement for board certification. In this renewal proposal, we continue to
emphasize the development and application of technology for biomedical imaging and image-guided therapy
apropos to NIBIB training priorities. We leverage the considerable success of our prior and current trainees in
obtaining academic radiology faculty positions, publishing high-impact research papers, and developing
independent research programs and funding, including the first 2 NIH Early Independence Awards ever given
to investigators primarily appointed in a radiology department. Other accomplishments include successful
integration of the research preceptorship year and research undertaken during subsequent fellowship
specialty training in order to assure continuity. Proposed Program innovations for this renewal include (1) a
dedicated spot for Interventional Radiology spurred by increasing research in the field and new training
pathways; (2) increased focus on rapidly advancing areas of imaging research – molecular imaging, imaging
analytics/informatics, and image-guide therapy – with new faculty mentors in these areas; and (3) further
integration of post-residency fellowship training and research to assure continuity from the Program's
dedicated research preceptorship. In summary, we request to continue our highly successful program to train
imaging and image-guided therapy focused clinician-scientists."

 This application addresses critical needs and deficiencies in prostate cancer (PCa) patient management.
The five year survival rates for localized primary PCa are excellent, but sadly fall to below 1 in 3 for those with
metastatic disease. The deluge of academic and clinical efforts to harness targeted agents for imaging of
Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), widely overexpressed on prostate cancer tissues, for improved
detection represents a sea change in how malignant disease will be monitored. Advancing close behind is a
systematic evaluation of therapeutic variants of these agents that deliver an ionizing radiation dose to PSMA-
expressing sites of disease.
 There is considerable interest in alpha particle (α-particle) emitting radionuclides for this targeted
radiotherapy as the high linear energy transfer imparts 5-8 MeV in a dense track that is only several cell diameters
in length. Unfortunately, widespread background-organ expression of PSMA results in untoward side-effects of
absorbed dose to normal tissues. Off-target toxicity places limitations on the activity dose which may be
administered; the patient population eligible for the treatment; the requirements for involved long term care of
comorbidities; and ultimately the overall impact this treatment will have in the clinic.
Here, we propose a strategy that enables organ specific reduction in absorbed dose without affecting
tumor targeted uptake. We focus on the salivary glands and kidneys; radiosensitive organs that demonstrate
intense PSMA-ligand targeting in pre- and clinical imaging and treatment studies. We have developed and
acquired significant insight into a novel prodrug, Tris-POC-2-PMPA that is preferentially deliverd to the kidneys
and salivary, and selectively cleaved in these organs, to release the high affinity PSMA inhibitor, 2-PMPA. Our
Preliminary Data demonstrate the potential to ensure that tumor specific ablation without toxicity can be achieved
while sparing kidney and salivary tissue. Taking advantage of a hybrid imaging and therapy approach, we will
define the optimal treatment course required for tumor control, without normal organ toxicity, in multiple small
animal xenograft and in an advanced genetically engineered model that most closely recapitulates human
disease.
 This application is being undertaken by a multidisciplinary team composed of experts in radiochemistry,
medical physics, pathology, drug development and clinical molecular imaging. This group of investigators and the
strength of our data addressing key issues in alpha particle emitting radiopharmaceutical development
demonstrate that this application has the potential to realize the transformative capabilities of molecularly targeted
radiotherapy for cancer patients."

People with HIV-1 (PWH) experience chronic inflammation that leads to comorbidities despite virological
suppression on anti-retroviral therapy. These individuals have high rates of substance abuse including
cannabinoids which have known immunomodulatory effects. Recent evidence has suggested an important role
of the NLRP3 inflammasome as a driver of inflammation. Cannabinoids have been shown to reduce
inflammasome activity. What remains unknown is the effect that cannabinoids have on HIV-stimulated NLRP3
inflammasome activity. Our goal is to elucidate the role of cannabinoids in modulating HIV-inflammasome
signaling in lymphoid tissue. This study is the proposal of an early stage investigator physician scientist who will
bring together expertise in HIV virology, immunology, receptor signaling, and genomics to test the following aims:
1) To determine the effect of cannabinoid treatment on HIV-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. 2) To
identify the cell types impacted by cannabinoid treatment on HIV-stimulated NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. 3)
To identify the impact of cannabinoid treatment on inflammatory signaling in infected and neighboring cells
through spatial transcriptomic analysis of infected tonsil blocks. The methods proposed are novel in that they
utilize a recently developed ex vivo human tonsil infection model and a single cell imaging and gene expression
platform that will allow for understanding the inflammatory signaling that is associated with HIV-1 infection on a
single cell level. The investigators and collaborators offer complimentary expertise and the facilities at the Mount
Sinai Health System are uniquely capable of supporting these studies with core facilities, large patient cohorts,
and institutional support. The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has demonstrated commitment to the
career development of this early stage principal investigator. The goal is to develop a successful career of the
PI as an independent physician scientist in dissecting out the pathogenesis of the cannabinoid signaling in HIV-
1 infection and downstream inflammasome signaling with the goal of finding key therapeutic agents in the
treatment of HIV-1 infection and inflammation and in understanding the interplay of chronic inflammation and
drugs of abuse."
10889169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of new methods for prenatal genetic editing in humans has accelerated the translation of
technologies designed to disrupt disease mechanisms or remove disease-causing mutations entirely. These
technologies show promise for preemptively addressing previously intractable genetic conditions. However,
recent events have demonstrated considerable gaps in the governance structure surrounding human gene
editing and its translation to clinical practice. Since the discovery that a scientist in China had conducted human
experiments allegedly resulting in the birth of three genetically edited children, numerous calls have been made
for a novel governance structure for prenatal human gene editing, frequently framed around moratoria or other
forms of suppression, and several international bodies have convened. There has been strong pressure towards
a values-based governance approach that moves beyond traditional technocratic considerations of safety and
efficacy and takes into account collective normative deliberation about the ethics of prenatal intervention. This is
challenging in the United States context, which is among the few high-income countries without centralized
regulation of research on embryos and/or translational assisted reproductive technologies. As such, two
important stakeholder voices have been largely left out of conversations around the future of prenatal gene
editing in the US context: the patients and families that might be benefitted or harmed by the translation of
prenatal gene editing and the scientists and clinicians who would be on the front lines of clinical translation were
it to move forward. We propose to fill this gap by conducting empirical research with these key stakeholders that
assesses potential governance approaches internationally and explores how they may be implemented in an
United States context. The goal is to move past generalizations to explore the direct policy mechanisms that are
feasible while incorporating the values and priorities of end users.
This study consists of three aims. The first two, contemporaneous, aims will consist of qualitative research with
two sets of stakeholders: patients and families affected by genetic conditions potentially addressable through
prenatal gene editing and clinicians and scientists involved in relevant translational and clinical activities in this
space. In Aim 1, We will begin by conducting a review of the international science policy landscape to gather
policy mechanisms that have been proposed or implemented to manage emerging technologies in the
reproductive science, genetics, and regenerative medicine spaces. We will identify policies that fall into a
spectrum from permissive to restrictive. These policies will be shared with stakeholders during qualitative
interviews to assess their concordance with stakeholder values and priorities. We will recruit a diverse cohort of
clinicians and scientist leaders from 20 key professional societies and conduct qualitative interview to assess
underlying normative underpinnings of proposed policy approaches, professional feasibility of proposals, and
values and priorities around the potential translation of prenatal gene editing in humans. The results of this Aim
will feed directly into the deliberative democracy exercises in Aim 3. In Aim 2, we will partner with Genetic
Alliance, the largest patient advocacy organization for genetic conditions to recruit a panel of patient advisors
from communities affected by 9 genetic conditions from across a spectrum of penetrance and severity. Together
with the advisors we will connect with patient advocacy and support groups in these communities to recruit a
cohort of patients and family members. Patients will be asked to share their understanding of the potential of
gene editing, their aspirations or concerns about its clinical applications, their priorities and goals in research on
their condition, and their views on the proposed policy approaches. In Aim 3 we will convene representatives
from both groups, together with the research team and select policymakers to conduct two deliberative
democracy exercises in which all stakeholders can deliberate towards a consensus on the appropriate
mechanisms for optimal governance of prenatal gene editing technologies. The results of all three aims will be
disseminated in the scientific, lay, and policy literatures."

Cellular differentiation is a fundamental biological process through which complex multi-cellular organisms
develop from single-cell embryos and maintain tissue homeostasis throughout life. Cells integrate signals from
the microenvironment and transmit them to downstream transcriptional regulators, which execute the expression
and chromatin changes to define phenotypic state transitions in differentiation trajectories. Elucidating the
principles of how cells choose their fate, and the path they take to get there, is a major challenge in the field.
Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of the cellular spatio-
temporal trajectories that shape differentiation. The emergence of additional high throughput, multimodal
technologies such as paired RNA&ATAC-seq, scCUT&Tag and spatial technologies provide unprecedented
opportunities to extract mechanistic insights into the lineage decisions that underly differentiation trajectories.
This proposal aims to exploit this enormous potential by developing sophisticated new algorithms that integrate
single-cell measurements to model and interpret complex biology. Through analysis of multiple single-cell RNA-
seq datasets, we demonstrate that phenotypic asymmetries are a pervasive feature of lineage decisions. We will
develop algorithms to unravel the mechanisms that drive lineage decisions and the underlying asymmetries in
three broad research directions. We will investigate the role of: (i) enhancer priming and transcriptional
regulation, (ii) open and heterochromatin dynamics, and (iii) cell communication in shaping differentiation
trajectories. Our studies will lead to novel insights surrounding cell-autonomous and non-autonomous
mechanisms engaged by cells as they navigate the phenotypic landscape. Successful completion of this
research will provide a robust mechanistic basis to delineate normal differentiation events, decipher
dysregulation of these mechanisms in disease, understand repurposing of differentiation mechanisms in wound
healing and regeneration, and reconstruct differentiation processes in vivo and ex vivo to unlock the therapeutic
potential of cell engineering."
10889020,"Project Summary/Abstract
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease affecting almost 2% of children in the US
alone. Despite its genetic and clinical heterogeneity, recent systems biology and genomics studies demonstrated
that ASD converges on a specific set of cellular pathways. Epigenetic regulation and synaptic signaling emerged
as the two most prominent pathways in ASD, with many high-confidence genetic risk factors and dysregulated
genes involved in these processes. This observation prompted a hypothesis that epigenetic dysregulation leads
to improper neuronal circuit development and function, which has been demonstrated in mouse models of
epigenetic regulators recurrently mutated in ASD, such as CHD8 (Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein
8). However, the exact epigenetic changes, cell types they affect and the neuronal circuitry changes resulting
from epigenetic dysregulation in ASD are unknown. Recently, single-cell genomics approaches, including single-
cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequinning, offered unprecedented new level of detail of cellular and
molecular composition of the brain, as well as processes underlying its development. In my postdoc, I applied
single-nucleus RNA sequencing to human post-mortem cortical tissue from ASD patients to gain insight into the
molecular changes associated with ASD in specific neuronal and glial subtypes. One of the most important
insights from this work is the implication of upper-layer cortical neurons as the cell type most affected by ASD-
associated transcriptional changes. This observation raises questions about the origin and functional effects of
such changes on specific neuronal circuits. As part of the Aim 1 of my K99 proposal, I will test the hypothesis
that gene expression changes in ASD are driven by changes in epigenetic states of specific cell types. To that
end, I will perform a joint RNA-seq and ATAC-seq profiling of neocortical tissue of ASD patients and controls to
identify cell type-specific epigenetic changes. Then, I will develop and test a high-throughput synaptic tracing
technique by combining barcoded rabies virus library with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (Aim 2 of K99 phase).
Finally, using the training, tools and preliminary data from the K99 phase of my proposal, I will launch an
independent research project that focuses on investigating cell-type specific epigenetic and neuronal circuitry
changes in the Chd8+/ mouse model during development (R00 phase). I will first apply the joint RNA-seq/ATAC-
seq protocol to study epigenetic changes in specific cell types during development caused by the loss of one of
Chd8 alleles. By crossing the Chd8+/ mouse with reporter lines expressing Cre recombinase in specific neuronal
subtypes, such as upper-layer cortical neurons (Cux2-Cre), I will be able to use the barcoded rabies virus library
and single-nucleus RNA-seq to identify changes in specific components of cortical circuitry as the result of Chd8
haploinsufficiency. I believe that the K99-R00 award will allow me to form a unique research direction and
establish myself as a successful independent investigator in the area of autism and single-cell genomics."
10889033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nef is an HIV-1 accessory protein whose function is to undermine host defenses. Long term infection with HIV
strains bearing defective nef alleles leads to AIDS only over many years, suggesting Nef could be targeted as
part of functional cure strategies. This basic research proposal seeks will elucidate the mechanisms of action
of Nef. Nef targets include CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28, CXCR4, MHC-I, SERINC3/5, and for HIV-1 group O and
SIV, BST2/tetherin. Nef substrates are downmodulated by via the clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) pathway. Nef
does not interact directly with clathrin, but rather with various members of a family of heterotetrameric adaptors
known as the adaptor protein (AP) complexes, AP-1 and AP-2. The ability of the human immune system to
detect and kill virally infected cells relies on proper presentation of viral antigens on the cell surface by MHC-I
complexes. Nef subverts this process by promoting MHC-I complex downregulation by hijacking AP-1 and its
associated small GTPase Arf1 at the TGN. MHC-I contains an incomplete version of the normal Tyr-based
sorting motif. Nef complements this defective motif and converts MHC-I into a substrate for AP-1 mediated
sorting to the lysosome for degradation. Structures of Nef assembled with AP-1 and the MHC-I cytosolic tail in
solution suggested that Nef promotes the assembly of hexagonal lattices whose symmetry matches that of
clathrin. Now, the previous solution studies will be followed up by reconstitution and structure determination of
Nef, MHC-I tail, AP-1 and Arf1 in their functional setting on lipid membranes. Downmodulation of CD28 by Nefs
is conserved across SIV and HIV and is mediated by AP-2. CD28 downmodulation phenotypes of Nef
mutations follow a distinct pattern from other receptors, and the structural basis for this mode of CD28 is
unknown. The structure of the CD28:HIV-1 Nef:AP-2 complex will be determined and leveraged to design
mutations that uniquely perturb the CD28 binding site. Of the many host substrates of Nef, the most significant
for viral infectivity are the multipass integral membrane proteins SERINC3 and 5. The SERINC binding site
appears, on the basis of Nef phenotypes, to overlap with the site used by SIVsmm Nef to downmodulate
simian tetherin, but is otherwise distinct from the known locations of CD3, CD4, and MHC-I sites. SERINCs do
not share any obvious motifs with other substrates. SERINCs have been purified in monodisperse form
suitable for structure determination. The cryo-EM structure of lipid- or detergent embedded SERINC3 or 5 in
complex with AP-2 and HIV-1 Nef will be determined, completing a major goal in the field."

In our original application for R01 HD056465 we hypothesized and proved that distillation of the genetic
component contributing to obesity is easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure has had
less of an impact due to a relatively short period of lifetime. During our first renewal, we successfully expanded
this programmatic line of research by identifying additional variants.
During the last funding cycles, we carried out a series of non-hypothesis-driven studies that were directed at
uncovering loci that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting various genome-wide based approaches.
For instance, employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined
as being in the ≥95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently
replicated. This first NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics, with the subsequent
larger trans-ethnic study being more recently reported.
Intense genome-wide association studies (GWAS) efforts by the community have yielded key variants robustly
associated with measures of adiposity, both in children and adults. Interestingly, while macro-level gene sets
analysis of overall GWAS findings for adult waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) have implicated adipogenesis, comparable
analyses of adult BMI GWAS datasets implicate central nervous system (CNS) processes.
Despite these macro-level analyses, an important caveat of GWAS is that they only report genomic association
signals and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit genes. As such, GWAS have not strictly
represented an era of gene target discovery, rather it was simply a decade of signal discovery. One clear
example of this is with progress in understanding the obesity GWAS signal that resides within an intronic
region of FTO. Specifically, the signal is now known to influence the expression of nearby genes, IRX3, IRX5
and RFGRIP1L, rather than the `host' gene itself. These discoveries suggest that the FTO variant is actually an
enhancer embedded in one gene that influences the expression of other causal genes.
Since we already have dedicated infrastructure, namely the Center for Spatial and Functional Genomics at the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), to conduct such `variant to gene mapping' efforts, our team is
poised to determine at scale how our reported childhood obesity loci affect the expression of specific genes in
neuronal relevant cells, namely neural precursors, microglia, astrocytes and hypothalamic neurons. This
involves the integration of high resolution `3D Genomics', `Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin
sequencing' (ATAC-seq), RNA-seq and CRISPR. This final step will enable us to fully infer effector genes.
Thus, the premise of this renewal is to uncover the correct functional context of the childhood obesity variants
identified by our GWAS in order to translate these discoveries into meaningful benefits for pediatric care."
10889222,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is a complex disorder of cortical bone quality and strength. Impaired cortical bone
is due to the combined actions of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and changes in bone hormones
as a result of kidney failure. ROD affects nearly all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and results in
cortical bone loss, cortical-type fractures and cardiovascular events. The current goal of ROD treatment, to re-
duce high bone turnover due to renal hyperparathyroidism, is contraindicated in the presence of low turnover yet
reliable ways to determine low turnover status are lacking. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
(KDIGO) guidelines recommend that treatment is guided by the biomarkers PTH and bone specific alkaline
phosphatase (BSAP) and not to treat when turnover is low. However, despite these recommendations, cortical-
type fracture incidence has doubled in dialysis patients over the past 25-years, a failure in fracture reduction due
in part to PTH and BSAP being developed to identify turnover in trabecular rather than cortical bone. Further-
more, although KDIGO recommends tetracycline-labeled bone biopsy to define turnover and guide treatment,
the histomorphometry is also based on analysis of trabecular and not cortical bone, the latter being the primary
site of PTH action. Our published preliminary data suggest that trabecular turnover is a poor surrogate for cortical
turnover, with only moderate correlations between bone compartments (R2 59%). Thus, there is an unmet need
to identify biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility for the identification of low cortical turnover,
used without or without trabecular turnover, to guide treatment decisions and for use in clinical trials. In our
published data, we hypothesized that an a priori defined subset of microRNAs (miRNA) that regulate osteoblast
(miRNA-30c, 30b, 125b) and osteoclast (miRNA-155) development would be accurate biomarkers of low cortical
turnover. In 23 CKD patients with bone biopsies, the areas under the curve for discrimination of low from non-
low turnover were 0.866, 0.813, 0.813, and 0.723 for miRNAs-30b, 30c, 125b and 155 respectively, 0.925 for a
panel of the 4 four miRNAs combined, while PTH and BSAP, individually and together, did not discriminate in
this population. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that circulating miRNAs discriminate ROD
cortical bone subtype. In a cohort of 90 CKD patients with low, normal, and high turnover (30/group; Aim 1) we
will use miRNAseq to identify novel miRNAs that correlate with ROD type and determine if their combination with
the preliminary panel enhances discrimination. In 40 ROD patients managed with strategies that change turnover
from high to low or low to high (n=20/group; Aim 2), we will determine if changes in histology-based turnover are
reflected by changes in the optimized panel and if the circulating miRNA panel mirrors bone-tissue miRNA ex-
pression. Then, we will determine if the panel is related to bone quality and strength (Aim 3). Our results will
determine if the circulating panel can serve as a biomarker for guiding ROD management. This high impact
proposal has the potential to result in a paradigm shift in the non-invasive diagnosis and management of ROD."
10889094,"The incidence of endometrial cancer is on the rise each year reaching over 60,000 new cases in the US in 2018. Obesity remains a significant public health problem and is a major risk factor for developing endometrial cancer. Although excess estrogen from adipose tissues is thought to predispose a woman from developing endometrial cancer, the protective role of progesterone in obesity is unknown. Studies demonstrate that the excess estrogen theory in obese women does not always hold true particularly in the premenopausal state. We hypothesize that adipose tissue release factors that activate the AKT pathway in endometrial epithelial cells to blunt progesterone receptor (PR) action, thereby increasing the risk of endometrial neoplasia. In this study, we will decipher the actions of PR in the human endometrium in the presence or absence of adipocytes using 3D spheroid cultures in microfluidic systems. These innovative technologies allow us to study for the first time, the effect of adipocytes on the signaling and genomic activities that affect progesterone sensitivity. We will determine how adipocytes affect progesterone driven differentiation and survival of the endometrial organoids and how changes in epigenetics, including DNA methylation and histone marks, affect the ER and PR cistrome. Unbiased sequencing will be done using technologies that allow for deep sequencing of small cell numbers. This research will generate insight into the early changes that may lead to tumorigenesis which will be useful to determine how to effectively prevent endometrial cancer in the obese women who are at high risk."

The goal of this phase I/II multicenter clinical trial is to improve walking function, dynamic stability, and
community mobility in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel combination of high-intensity training
and an environment that challenges dynamic balance. There are two critical elements of this proposal: 1)
balance perturbations applied during treadmill walking will allow participants to develop neuromuscular
strategies to maintain upright posture, which will be refined and enhanced with repeated practice, and 2)
patients who engage in high-intensity training will improve their neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory capacity
to facilitate the ability to walk faster and further. Indeed, patients with mild or moderate MS present with altered
locomotor and postural control, and this 2X2 factorial design will delineate the individual and combined effects
of repeated exposure to postural perturbations during walking and high-intensity exercise that may enhance
locomotor and balance control in both laboratory conditions and in the real-world, where the locomotor and
postural demands are substantial. This study is predicated on the previous experience of the investigators with
high-intensity training in patients with other neurological disorders and promising results of a pilot study
demonstrating feasibility of dynamic balance treadmill training in people with MS. The present project will
attempt to delineate changes in clinical and laboratory measures of locomotor capacity following walking-
specific exercise training at high vs low intensity and with or without postural perturbations during treadmill
stepping (Aim 1). Aim 2 will demonstrate the relative efficacy of these strategies on dynamic postural control
(i.e., balance) and relate improvements in the response to perturbations to secondary measures of community
falls. Finally, Aim 3 will delineate changes in community mobility and participation following these various
exercise paradigms. We suggest that high-intensity locomotor training with postural perturbations will elicit the
largest changes in both locomotor and balance outcomes, and these combined gains will boost physical
activity in the community setting leading to improved quality of life."

the feasibility of expanding tumor-reactive TIL, a fundamental requirement for adoptive cell therapy (ACT), he
completed an FDA investigational new drug (IND) application, developed a clinical trial protocol, and obtained
funding for activation. With these efforts successful, he is now the principal investigator of a clinical trial which
will assess the safety and feasibility of ACT in patients with metastatic STS.
The scientific work he has proposed includes a deeper study of the interaction between the tumor and T-cells
within STS. The molecular pathogenesis of STS is different than most epithelial tumors where copy number
variation or reciprocal chromosomal translocation results in oncogenesis of mesenchymal tissue, as opposed
to the point mutations commonly seen in epithelial malignancies. Dr. Mullinax has outlined a scope of work
that will utilize bioinformatics analysis to understand the relationship between genomic instability and the
expansion of TIL from STS. He will also complete experiments to understand the tumor-specific activity of T-
cell subsets, specifically tissue resident memory (TRM) T-cells, as a method of selecting optimal clonal
expansion in the cellular infusion product delivered to patients in ACT clinical trials.
Completion of this work will be overseen closely by his primary mentor Shari Pilon-Thomas, PhD and co-
mentor James J Mulé, PhD. He will meet weekly with his primary mentor, bi-weekly with his clinical trial
advisors (Damon Reed, MD and Amod Sarnaik MD), and quarterly with his complete advisory committee which
adds Jose Conejo-Garcia, MD, PhD and Jamie Teer, PhD to the above faculty. He has described a rigorous
schedule of didactic course work to address training the ethics of trial design, grant writing, and biostatistics.
Completion of this work will position Dr. Mullinax well for R01 submission during the penultimate year of this
award and ensure the expertise needed to conduct early phase clinical trials which translate the findings of his
laboratory to therapeutic options for the STS patients that he treats in his clinical practice."

In order to teach the future scientists of tomorrow, investment into supporting their teachers today needs to be
made. The complexity of scientific ideas and access to data has exploded in the first decades of the 21st century.
These include advancements in molecular biology that have enabled researchers to better understand the
structure-function relationship of nucleic acids and proteins as it relates to human health. These contemporary
understandings in molecular biology are often unknown to secondary-level teachers and can be difficult for
secondary-level students to learn as it requires them to use and integrate multiple levels of biological
organization. Advances in computational power and access provide a unique opportunity to make molecular
biology accessible to all students by bringing it to life in the classroom. Teachers need supportive, ongoing
professional development to successfully integrate these investigative practices into their classrooms.
The overall goal of the SHaping of Authentic Practices by Engaging in Modeling of A Topic with Teachers
to Explore Research in Science (SHAPE MATTERS) project is to engage high school science teachers in a
rigorous professional development experience that will impact 100s of students per participating teacher. Specific
Aim 1: The SHAPE MATTERS team will develop and implement a professional development experience for
teachers to increase their knowledge of the scientific practices involved in molecular biology research. Teachers
will examine a series of molecular stories of current research projects and then work directly with a research
mentor to explore a specific phenomenon and associated investigative strategies in molecular biology. They will
ultimately develop a 3-dimensional model of the relevant molecule and present a new molecular story. Specific
Aim 2: Biomolecular science curriculum will be created within Central Pennsylvania secondary schools centered
on authentic scientific practices through the SHAPE MATTERS program. With researcher and science education
faculty support, educators will develop and implement classroom research projects (CLRPs) with high school
students. From this, teachers will generate an Impact Report documenting the impact of the curriculum on their
instructional practice as well as student learning and interest. The curriculum will be disseminated broadly across
Pennsylvania. Specific Aim 3: SHAPE MATTERS will establish SMART teams in Pennsylvania to engage
teachers and students in modeling practices through authentic research projects connected to the basic biology
and chemistry concepts. Participating high school students across Pennsylvania will showcase their molecular
stories in the community-based symposium event. Magnolia Consulting will lead the program evaluation using a
treatment-group only, mixed-methods approach. The evaluation will use data collected through the review of
program artifacts and records, interviews, online surveys, and observations to examine the development,
implementation, and perceptions of the SHAPE MATTERS summer workshop, CLRPS, and SMART teams."

The Emergency Department (ED) is an essential care setting for Veteran persons living with dementia (PLWDs),
with 40% of community-dwelling PLWDs making at least one ED visit per year. One of the most impactful and
costly elements of ED care is the decision to admit a patient to the hospital or discharge them home- the “dispo-
sition” decision. ED providers must balance the risks of unnecessary admissions, such as delirium and functional
decline, against the risks of discharge, which may result in return ED visits and hospitalizations. ED providers
lack best practices to incorporate PLWD and caregiver values and preferences in the disposition decision when
there is no serious illness that clearly requires admission. Shared decision making (SDM) tools can facilitate
complex conversations between patients, caregivers, and ED providers, to ensure that patients and caregivers
are involved in decisions about their care. The research proposed in this application is designed to develop a
shared decision making tool to support ED dispositions that are aligned with PLWD and caregiver goals.
With the support of her mentorship team, this proposal is also intended to support the continued career devel-
opment of Dr. Justine Seidenfeld, an extremely promising emergency medicine physician-scientist, within the
field of emergency care health services research. During this period of support, she will pursue didactic instruc-
tion and further training to 1) advance her skills in methods for conducting research with PLWDs and their
caregivers, 2) learn best practices to design and implement interventions aligned with end-user needs, and 3)
develop skills for development and testing of SDM tools. The expected outcome of this proposal is to construct
and pilot test a SDM tool to support high-quality ED dispositions for PLWDs.
This study employs a sequential design based on the 3-step decision aid development process created by the
International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) collaboration. Aims 1 and 2 will address the first “under-
stand user” step through quantitative and qualitative methods. Aim 1 will calculate home time (i.e., days alive
and out of acute and post-acute settings) after an ED visit for a cohort of Veterans with dementia, and identify
Veteran, ED facility, and visit type characteristics that are associated with variation in home time to suggest
groups that may benefit from a customized SDM tool. Aim 2 will use qualitative interviews with Veteran PLWDs,
their caregivers, and ED providers after an ED visit to assess their unmet needs, values, and preferences when
making a disposition decision. To fulfill the “development/refinement” and “assessment” steps of the IPDAS de-
velopment process, Aim 3a will create and iteratively refine a prototype SDM tool with feedback from a multidis-
ciplinary collaborator panel, and Aim 3b will then use a iterative cohort pilot study design to assess the feasibility
and acceptability among PLWDs, caregivers, and ED providers."

In the early vertebrate embryo, signaling pathways instruct cell fates and orchestrate
morphogenetic movements, placing cells into proper positions to experience new rounds of
signaling and new waves of fate specification and morphogenesis. A long standing question
remains how changes in cell polarity determine collective cell behaviors during early development.
To approach this problem, this program focuses on the core planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway that
is one of the main drivers of morphogenetic processes in vertebrates. Core PCP proteins have
been discovered in Drosophila genetic studies. In vertebrates, the PCP protein complexes
Vangl/Pk/Celsr and Fz/Dvl/Celsr are conserved and accumulate at opposite cell edges along the
body axis, marking tissue polarity. The significance of the core PCP proteins extends far beyond
being epithelial polarity markers, as their vertebrate homologs function in key developmental
processes, including gastrulation movements, neural tube closure and branching morphogenesis,
the formation of functional cilia and left-right patterning. To gain mechanistic knowledge of
morphogenetic events, including vertebrate gastrulation, we will study the following long-standing
questions in the field: a) how cells polarize in response to a cue, b) how the cell polarity translates
into spatially restricted activation of effectors such as Myosin II, and c) how actomyosin contractions
and the resulting mechanical forces alter cell shape and coordinate collective cell movements.
New force-dependent genes that are involved in the control of morphogenesis will be identified.
These directions will be pursued using high resolution imaging, embryological and molecular
biological techniques combined with systems level analysis (proteomics and transcriptomics). Our
studies will use Xenopus embryos as our main experimental model, due to their fast external
development, ease of experimental manipulation and large size allowing biochemical and systems
biology approaches. The proposed studies will advance the knowledge of basic cell biological
mechanisms underlying vertebrate morphogenesis. High relevance to human health is due to the
known connections of PCP signaling to multiple congenital defects and syndromes, polycystic
kidney disease and cancers."
10868896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this work is to identify pain-induced adaptations in the prefrontal cortical dynorphin / kappa-opioid
receptor system and the role this system plays in pain-induced mal-adaptive behavior and nociception. Chronic
pain drives adaptations in prefrontal cortical circuits and is hypothesized to increase bias towards aversive
experiences. Our preliminary data demonstrates that inhibitory and excitatory populations of prefrontal cortical
dynorphin neurons are activated and release dynorphin neuropeptide in response to aversive stimuli. However,
it is unclear whether prefrontal cortical dynorphin neuron activity and ensuing dynorphin release is impacted by
pain. To address this knowledge gap, we will perform ex-vivo electrophysiological procedures and in-vivo single
cell calcium imaging in freely moving mice to determine how pain influences activity of excitatory and inhibitory
prefrontal cortical dynorphin neurons and their responsivity to noxious stimuli and aversive stimuli. Moreover, we
will manipulate the activity of prefrontal cortical dynorphin neurons and release of dynorphin neuropeptides or
fast transmitters to determine whether enhanced prefrontal cortical dynorphin neuron activity and transmitter
release controls nociception and mal-adaptive affective behavior induced by pain. Taken together, this work will
identify how genetically-defined sub-populations of prefrontal cortical neurons and the opioid peptides or fast
excitatory and inhibitory transmitters they release influence negative affect induced by pain from the cellular to
in-vivo level of analysis. This work is of broad relevance as it elucidates basic principles by which neuropeptide-
expressing neurons in prefrontal cortical circuits control behavioral plasticity and delineate potentially new
therapeutic targets for the treatment of mal-adaptive affect and increased responsivity to noxious and aversive
stimuli associated with pain states."

Our preliminary data, as well as our previous published studies, show that ME/CFS cases have alterations in
gastrointestinal mucosal immunity and mitochondrial homeostasis. Several other studies have described
significant alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome in ME/CFS cases, when compared to age and
gender-matched controls, potentially implicating a pathological role for a dysbiotic microbiota in the progression
of ME/CFS through the gut-microbiota-brain axis. We hypothesize that by conducting a fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) with stool from ME/CFS cases into mice that are engrafted with a functional human
immune system, we can develop an animal model that will replicate ME/CFS-associated pathology. We further
hypothesize that this model can be used to conduct ME/CFS research that is not practical or possible when
working with human subjects.
In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize and transplant stool from ME/CFS cases and healthy controls into
common C57BL/6J laboratory mice, which have a normal murine immune system, as well as mice that are
engrafted with a functional human immune system. We will then evaluate these mice for exercise intolerance,
neurocognitive dysfunction, and sleep disturbances; behavioral alterations consistent with those observed in
human cases. In Aim 2, we will pathologically evaluate these mice to identify changes in the gut and the brain
that potentially implicate the altered microbiota in ME/CFS pathophysiology. These studies will lay the
foundation for a larger research focus to identify ways to target the gut-microbiota brain axis in the prevention
and treatment of ME/CFS.
ME/CFS is a multisystemic, debilitating, and neglected illness for which no accepted efficacious treatments are
currently available. Population-based epidemiologic studies suggest that ME/CFS may affect as many as 2.5
million people in the United States alone. Moreover, ME/CFS produces an annual economic burden of at least
$17 billion 4. Although ME/CFS represents a serious public health concern, after almost four decades of research,
the pathophysiology of this illness is still largely unknown."
10869706,"Project Summary/Abstract
Patients with penicillin allergies receive toxic antibiotics that place them at higher risk for adverse events,
including surgical site infections. However, most patients who report a penicillin allergy can tolerate penicillins
and other beta-lactam style antibiotics without any problems. One large healthcare system silenced low risk
penicillin alerts without increasing adverse events for patients. BJC HealthCare, our 14 hospital network
headquartered in St. Louis, MO, silenced low risk penicillin alerts in 2019 based on these findings. We have
been able to demonstrate that silencing low risk penicillin allergy alerts was also safe in our healthcare system.
For this project, we propose to evaluate the impact silencing low risk penicillin allergy alerts for surgical
patients in our healthcare system. We hypothesize that removal of the alert will be associated with an increase
in cefazolin prescribing for common surgeries via an interrupted time series analysis. We also hypothesize that
the removal of the alert will be associated with a reduction in surgical site infection rates among penicillin
allergic patients but not control (non-penicillin allergic) patients using an interrupted time series analysis.
We believe that this project aligns well with the mission of AHRQ to “produce evidence to make healthcare
safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used.”
Indeed, this intervention to silence low risk penicillin allergy alerts would be scalable in any healthcare system
without requiring any additional resources. If effective, this simple intervention could be easily added to existing
AHRQ toolkits or provide preliminary data for a large pragmatic prospective multicenter study. This is unique
among most research projects, as implementation of new innovations requires substantial investment among
healthcare systems that often have limited resources.
We are well suited to complete the proposed work. All of the proposed data has already been collected during
routine patient care. We already have IRB approval, and we have collected much of it prior to grant
submission. For the remaining steps, we have assembled an outstanding team of investigators that includes
leaders in infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, allergy/immunology, and biostatistics. These
individuals have a strong track record of collaborating, obtaining extramural funding, and completing their
proposed research projects."

This goal of this proposal is to investigate a novel photothermal nanoparticle-based approach for generating
tumor-specific T cells as an adoptive T cell therapy (ATCT) for glioblastoma (GBM). Despite being the most
commonly diagnosed brain tumor, the prognosis for GBM patients is dismal, with a relative five-year survival rate
of 7.5%. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapies for this patient population. In response, we are
synthesizing novel Prussian blue nanoparticle-based formulations that will be used to administer photothermal
therapy (PBNP-PTT) and generate a personalized ATCT for GBM. Our approach involves treating GBM tumor
cells resected during surgery with PBNP-PTT ex vivo, and co-culturing them with dendritic cells (DCs) and T
cells expanded from PBMCs sourced from the patient or a matched donor, to expand GBM-specific T cells for
subsequent ATCT. We envision our therapy to be administered to patients after standard-of-care regimens of
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, when GBM patients are in a minimally residual disease state, with
the goal of maximizing the impact of the T cell therapy thus improving survival outcomes. In a recently published
study with GBM tumor cell lines, we demonstrated that PBNP-PTT generated more potent tumor-specific T cells
in terms of specificity and cytolytic function, when compared to T cells generated by freeze-thaw lysis of the GBM
tumor cells or by heating of the tumor cells on a heat block at equivalent thermal doses. In vivo, our immune
engineered T cells eliminated orthotopically implanted U87 xenograft tumors and significantly improved survival
compared to tumor-bearing animals treated with lysate-derived, antigen (PRAME)-specific, or PHA-expanded T
cells, and control treatments. Operationally, our approach represents a more seamless workflow than other
personalized approaches. It involves a straightforward, single administration of PBNP-PTT to the GBM cells
isolated after surgery for 10 minutes using PBNPs pre-synthesized with GLP techniques and a portable laser,
followed by well-established DC and T cell expansion protocols. Building on these promising findings, we now
propose to synthesize multiple PBNP-PTT nanoformulations to generate and expand tumor-specific T cells and
conduct studies testing their efficacy in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo, as well as mechanistic studies. We hypothesize
that PBNP-PTT of GBM tumor cells using our PBNP nanoformulations significantly enhances antigen release
and capture by the PBNPs, their processing and presentation by DCs allowing more robust activation of a diverse
T cell population, which subsequently differentiates into cytotoxic effector and long-lasting memory phenotypes,
the ideal ATCT product for safe and effective treatment of GBM. Success in this project will demonstrate the use
of PBNP-PTT nanoformulations to generate a transformative, new class of ATCT for GBM."
10871465,"1 Particulate matter emitted through incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, known as combustion-
 2 emitted particulate matter (CE-PM), has emerged as a critical public health and climate change issue in the
 3 United States (US) and world-wide. Despite the implementation of The Clean Air Act in the 1970s, which led to
 4 a persistent reduction in ambient PM2.5 levels in the US, racial-ethnic disparities in PM exposure remain
 5 significant. People of color (POC), on average, experience disproportionate exposure to ambient PM2.5, with
 6 Black Americans experiencing the highest levels of PM2.5 exposure both nation-wide (by 34% higher than White
 7 Americans) and in most states. Moreover, the majority (>75%) of PM2.5 that POC breathe is from emission
 8 sources disproportionately affecting POC. This pattern is consistent across exposure levels, even in POC with
 9 optimal social determinants of health status (SDOH). The literature also reports that Black Americans reside
10 near emission sources such as traffic and industry due to a legacy of racist housing policies, and thus may be
11 exposed to more toxic PM, i.e., fresh combustion particles. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding
12 whether racial-ethnic disparity in ambient PM2.5 exposure can translate to higher lung deposition dose of black
13 carbon in Black versus White Americans and whether Black Americans are exposed to PM with stronger pro-
14 inflammatory potency than White Americans. We hypothesized that not only do Black Americans have higher
15 PM exposure, but that they are also exposed to more toxic PM due to the proximity of their neighborhoods to
16 traffic and industry. Macrophage carbon load (MaCL) is a novel sputum cytology-based method that quantifies
17 black carbon particles engulfed by the macrophages and reflects the lung dose of total CE-PM exposure at an
18 individual level over the past several months. We have successfully developed an innovative Machine-Learning
19 algorithm for Engulfed cArbon Particles (MacLEAP) that automates the scoring process of MaCL assay, and is
20 validated, high-throughput, and scorer-independent. This application will utilize biospecimens (sputum and blood)
21 from the Subpopulations and Intermediate Markers in COPD Study (SPIROMICS), a NHLBI-funded
22 observational study, which enrolled a geographically diverse cohort consisting predominantly of Black and White
23 Americans. We have identified 139 Black and White Americans each that are frequency-matched by age (± 10
24 years), sex (male and female), and stratum (non-smokers, smokers without airflow obstruction, smokers with
25 mild/moderate COPD, and smokers with severe COPD). Specific Aim 1 will assess whether Black Americans
26 have higher lung deposition dose of black carbon compared to White Americans using MaCL assay. Specific
27 Aim 2 will compare pro-inflammatory potency of PM exposures between Black and White Americans based on
28 slopes of the dose-response relationship between MaCL and pulmonary and systemic inflammation. Successful
29 completion of this study will greatly advance our understanding of racial-ethnic disparities in PM exposure and
30 toxicity, which is critical for identifying drivers of racial-ethnic disparities in PM induced health effects."

The objectives of the UCSF Pediatric Endocrinology T32 Training Program are to: 1) Recruit a superb and
diverse group of Fellows committed to academic careers in Pediatric Endocrinology. 2) Provide an academic
“incubator” for each Fellow that provides a rich and lasting mentored experience and fosters scientific career
development. 3) Develop the next generation of leaders and mentors in Pediatric Endocrinology. Hormonal
systems regulate key physiologic processes in virtually all organ systems, and are especially important for
growth, reproduction and carbohydrate homeostasis; these are areas addressed by Pediatric Endocrinology.
There is currently a national shortage of Pediatric Endocrinologists that is at-risk of worsening without funded
training programs. Furthermore, well-trained academic Pediatric Endocrine investigators are needed to advance
this complex and rapidly developing field. The Program at UCSF is open to physician scientists, with either MD
or MD/PhD, who are pursuing research in Pediatric Endocrine related programs. Trainees will be funded by this
T32 grant for 1-3 years, and devote at least 80% of their time to their research efforts. Fellows take a summer
workshop in clinical research or related introductory core courses in basic science; a course in Responsible
Conduct in Research; and have numerous other opportunities to participate in didactic coursework, lecture
series, and journal clubs in the type of research most germane to their future academic interests. Trainees work
with the Principal Investigators, Program Director, and Program Faculty to identify research projects, with a
primary research mentor and Mentoring Team. The Trainees select from 28 different Program Faculty, who
have broad, diverse research interests related to Pediatric Endocrinology; are well funded; and have a strong
track record for mentoring Trainees. Trainees learn to design and execute basic, translational, and/or clinical
research projects; analyze data; and present the data at national meetings, as well as write manuscripts for
prominent peer-reviewed journals. In addition, Trainees prepare and submit grants for extra-mural funding,
further preparing them for independent academic careers. The special strengths of this program include: 1) The
diverse skills and interests of the faculty. 2) A dedicated committee committed to the recruitment and mentorship
of trainees in Pediatric Endocrinology that are under-represented in medicine. 3) The substantial laboratory
resources of the faculty. 4) A robust Clinical and Translational Science Institute with Pediatric Clinical Research
Center, which facilitates training in state-of-the-art clinical investigation, and the opportunity to obtain a certificate
for Advanced Training in Clinical Research or Master’s Degree. 5) Comparable programs for basic science
training in the UCSF biomedical sciences programs. 6) The outstanding environment for research in
endocrinology and related areas at UCSF. 7) A network of research core facilities supporting the UCSF research
community, and available to all Trainees. The continuing success of this program is shown by the fact that since
1966, 81% of the Fellowship graduates have held positions in academic medicine."

Nicotine addiction in the form of habitual tobacco use is the leading cause of premature death in the United
States and costs at least $170 billion in healthcare-related expenses each year. In addition to its addictive
qualities, nicotine triggers a plethora of respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune disorders,
reflecting its actions in not only the brain, but also in the body of smokers. While it is well established that the
addictive properties of nicotine are related to its direct pharmacological actions on nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors located in reward and motivation brain circuits, evidence from our lab suggests that noxious effects of
nicotine related to its actions on hindbrain aversion circuits (e.g. nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS),
interpeduncular nucleus, and medial habenula) play a significant role in regulating nicotine intake as well.
However, it is unclear if nicotine acts solely on these circuits by direct action on centrally expressed nicotinic
receptors or if nicotine also acts indirectly via vagally (nodose ganglia, NG) derived sensory inputs that terminate
primarily at the NTS. Preliminary data presented in this grant application strongly suggest a role for peripheral
actions of nicotine in controlling nicotine intake. For instance, the peripherally-restricted, full nicotine agonist,
methylnicotinium causes a conditioned place aversion beyond that generated by an equimolar dose of nicotine.
Further, the peripherally-restricted cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) agonist, CCK-8 (10 µ*kg-1) decreased
volitional nicotine intake, especially at anxiogenic nicotine doses. Given these preliminary data and the
observation that plasma CCK levels are dysregulated by nicotine in rodents and humans, I hypothesize that
CCKRs in gut-innervating NG neurons potentiate aversive nicotine signals from the periphery to the NTS thereby
regulating nicotine intake. I will test this hypothesis using a nicotine intravenous self-administration mouse model
in combination with CCKR-specific lesions of the NG, FosTRAP mice, and chemogenetics. I will then define the
transcriptional responsiveness of the NG to an aversive dose of nicotine using single cell RNA sequencing.
Finally, I will employ an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genomic cleavage strategy to knockdown prioritized
nicotine-response genes in the NG and assess the consequences on nicotine intake. Completion of this highly
innovative proposal will substantially advance my technical skills in mouse genetics, surgery, and computer
programing, and provide me with entirely new training in single cell sequencing, bioinformatics, and advanced
genome editing technologies. It will also contribute to the currently sparse literature about how sensory
information related to nicotine actions in the periphery are transmitted via the vagus to the hindbrain. Defining
such a mechanism will position me for a successful independent career in the exciting and rapidly growing field
of brain-body interactions. In summation, this training plan will provide me with the conceptual, technical, and
learning experiences that will serve as a springboard for my transition to an independent research investigator."
10864541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is a major cause of disability in the U.S., disproportionately impacting older adults.
Ischemic stroke accounts for over 75% of stroke subtypes, but the only approved treatments rely
on blood flow restoration (reperfusion). Significant gains made in acute stroke treatments have
increased the number of patients undergoing acute reperfusion treatment. Despite successful
reperfusion, most patients still suffer from post-stroke disability, driven in part by
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Activation of the inflammatory response following ischemic
stroke is known to cause further neurologic injury, and impairs recovery. Neutrophils are the initial
cell type involved in this inflammatory response, however our understanding of neutrophil-
mediated brain injury following ischemic stroke is lacking. Therapeutic advancements for I/R injury
are unlikely without better understanding the neutrophil-mediated injury following ischemic stroke.
By leveraging publicly available gene expression datasets, we found a potentially critical
transcription factor, nuclear receptor Nr4a2, was upregulated in neutrophils. Nr4a2 is widely
expressed in several types of leukocytes, but universally serves as a regulator of lifespan and
longevity. Nr4a2 is also upregulated in circulating neutrophils in aged mice and humans,
suggesting that neutrophils from older adults may persist once entering the ischemic brain.
We hypothesize that 1.) Neutrophils persist in the ischemic brain following I/R in aged brains
compared to younger brains due to increased neutrophil Nr4a2 expression, and 2.) Increased
Nr4a2 expression in recruited neutrophils contribute to impaired neutrophil function and increased
injury following ischemic stroke, leading to worse outcomes.
Aim 1 will focus on how NR4A2 affects the spatiotemporal recruitment and persistence of
neutrophils following ischemic stroke. Aim 2 will determine how NR4A2 impacts neutrophil
function and overall outcomes following ischemic stroke. These aims will be tested using a murine
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model with young and aged wild-type C57Bl/6 Catchup
mice crossed with Nr4a2 knockout mice.
The proposed studies will fill an important knowledge gap regarding the neutrophil-response
following acute I/R and address the discrepancy in this response in aged brains. Findings from
these studies will inform development of novel therapies targeting neutrophil-mediated
mechanisms of brain injury. The proposed study has the potential for expanding treatment
approaches for ischemic stroke beyond blood flow restoration and has broad potential translation
to other aging-related brain disorders."

Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure human brain activity non-invasively, using sensors
placed on or above the head, with millisecond accuracy, and have long been used to study neural and cognitive
processes. This project is to develop a user-friendly, open-source analysis pipeline to make recent innovations
in analysis techniques available to a broad audience. First, M/EEG has traditionally been analyzed primarily as
event-related activity (an experiment is conceptualized as a series of trials, each constituting a unique event; for
example, the response to a syllable da). Such experiments typically require many repetitions of identical trials to
separate signal from noise in the M/EEG response. More recent techniques allow conceptualizing experimental
time as continuous, with different aspects of stimuli that are distributed in time evoking different overlapping brain
responses (for example, the auditory cortex response continuously “tracks” the acoustic envelope of speech, or
the visual cortex tracks the amount of visual motion in a movie, etc.). In this time-continuous analysis, no
repeated trials are necessary, and the signal is instead estimated using detailed models of the stimuli. Second,
while brain activity is measured outside of the head, it has long been possible to estimate anatomically localized
sources of this activity in the brain, and recent advances have greatly improved this source estimation. These
two advances (single-trial continuous analysis and improved source localization) have only recently been
combined successfully, and no off-the-shelf software package allows researchers to readily apply this method to
existing or new datasets. This project will develop such a software tool with an easy-to-use pipeline for group
level analysis. The technique that this tool will make available is essential for analyzing data from experimental
designs with naturalistic stimuli (for example, participants watching a movie or listening to an audiobook). Such
experiments offer enhanced validity, and are rich and versatile: researchers can test many different hypotheses
about what neural processes are evoked by the stimuli. However, the traditional averaging techniques that are
widely available are not remotely suitable. The software tool developed here is ideally suited for analyzing such
datasets. It will be made widely accessible and user-friendly, to lower the threshold for non-neuroscientists to
test hypotheses about neural representations. For example, existing datasets of audiobook listening could be
used by psychologists, computer scientists and linguists to test hypotheses about neural representations of
speech."

Despite recommendations from the American Dental Association, dentists face barriers such as limited time,
training hindering their ability to effectively screen for IPV. Evidence shows that 2-50% of care providers screen
for IPV. To streamline IPV screening for dentists, Dr. Banava will employ state-of-the-art machine learning

of IPV-related Orofacial Injuries and Conditions in Electronic Health Records. Dr. Banava will leverage standard
IPV-related orofacial injury and condition terms to conduct a comprehensive search within the UCSF structured
electronic health record (EHR) database Epic (APeX), which encompasses electronic dental records as well.
Next, Dr. Banava will extract embedded IPV-related data from notes, manually annotate, and validate with patient
chart review and actual diagnosis (gold standard). Later, Dr. Banava will apply NLP techniques, such as Named
Entity Recognition, to annotate the same set of notes and evaluate their precision, recall, and F1 score.
Additionally, Dr. Banava will leverage advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) within the NLP framework to
further enhance the annotation process. Aim 2: Develop an IPV-Specific Clinical Decision Support Tool and
Assess its Feasibility and Acceptability. Dr. Banava will collaborate with the UCSF APeX Enabled Research
team to develop a prototype of an IPV-specific clinical decision support tool, leveraging generated data. Adopting
a human-centered design approach, Dr. Banava will engage domain experts and conduct iterative focus groups
to ensure the tool's user-friendliness, alignment with clinical workflows, and effectiveness in decision-making and
case management. The focus groups, following a mixed methods research design, will take place during both
the development and post-development phases of the project. Additional groups may be included if information
saturation is not achieved. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the developed tool, Dr. Banava will use
the Technology Acceptance Model and incorporate prompts accordingly. A comparison will be made between
the tool and a standard IPV screening approach. The primary objective of the K23 Award is to provide Dr. Banava
with structured training in advanced quantitative statistical analyses and modeling techniques, health informatics,
natural language processing, and mixed methods research. This award will empower Dr. Banava to bridge

amyloid-PET, tau-PET, regional brain volumes for ATN classification and brain MR measures of vascular
disease. A key goal of the imaging core is to obtain and share robust neuroimaging biomarker data relevant to
AD in Black or African American (B/AA) individuals, a population underrepresented in imaging biomarker
studies. These imaging data will be available to investigators at UAB and other institutions to support research
in B/AA populations and to further the understanding of the impact of racial disparities in AD and related
cognitive disorders. PET and MRI data will be acquired in the centrally located UAB Advanced Imaging Facility
using a simultaneous PET/MRI system, processed using a validated semi-automated workflow, and shared
with other investigators through a secure cloud-based platform. Qualitative and quantitative summaries of
image analysis as well as anonymized DICOM data sets will be available to investigators through data use
requests. The Imaging Core will work closely with the Clinical and Data Management and Statistical Cores to
maximize the percentage of the ADRC cohort who participate in molecular neuroimaging and to ensure that
the imaging data for individuals are linked to their clinical assessment, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers,
and other assessments. The Imaging Core will also support investigators who wish to use investigational PET
tracers and MRI techniques for research projects that build upon the ADRC cohort. The Imaging Core will also
support training and educational activities in structural and molecular neuroimaging for trainees and junior
faculty in neurology, neuroscience, radiology, nuclear medicine and other relevant specialties."

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) proposes to renew a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in
the Basic Biology of Aging focused on comparative bioenergetics and aging. Energetics is comprehensively
defined for this purpose as the study of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the acquisition,
storage, and utilization of metabolizable energy. Comparative energetics is the study of metabolic processes at
multiple scales and across multiple species, in this case as it relates to health and aging. Nearly a century of
aging research has reinforced the link between energetics and aging. In modern terms, this link is reified as
dysregulated mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and nutrient responsiveness. The twin objectives of
the Center will be to 1) explore in greater depth and detail than previously possible the complex relationship
among cellular and organismal energetics and their relationship to whole organisms' energetics, health, and
aging, and 2) provide quantitative, state-of-the-art technologies and novel methodologies in the assessment
and analysis of bioenergetics to the geroscience community at large. In pursuit of these objectives, we will
continue to provide three Research Cores. 1) The Comparative Organismal Energetics Core (a.k.a.
Organismal Core) will provide expertise and cutting-edge instruction and methodology for determining
complete whole-animal energy balance (intake, assimilation, and expenditure) and body composition, including
regional distribution of white and brown adipose tissue, in living animals of various species, including worms,
flies, fish, mice, or other mammals, under diverse temperature or activity regimes. 2) The Comparative
Mitochondrial Health Assessment Core (a.k.a. Mitometabolism Core) will provide integrated, quantitative
mitochondrial functional analysis at the level of the organelle, cell, or tissue for both traditional and emerging
animal models, including targeted metabolomics, assessment of mitophagy, and oxidative stress.
Mitochondrial-nuclear exchange models also will be available to enable experiments that evaluate the
contribution of mtDNA variation to bioenergetics. 3) The Comparative Data Analytics Core (a.k.a. Analytics
Core) will provide innovative analytic approaches to data sets linking comparative energetics to organismal
health and longevity.
 With these Research Cores plus the Administrative Program Enrichment Core (Admin Core) and Research
Development Core (RDC), we aim to: 1) facilitate hypothesis-driven research and leverage these technologies
into new projects, interactions, and collaborations nationwide in basic aging research; 2) foster meaningful
novel interactions among investigators within UAB and across the region and country; and 3) provide
resources, education, training, and direction to junior investigators through the intellectual resources and
research infrastructure the Center will develop."
10865505,"Abstract
We pioneered a novel regulatory CD8 T subset (CD8 Treg) that promotes transplant tolerance by suppressing
pathogenic CD4 T cells. CD8 Tregs use semi-variant TCRs that allow the selective killing of alloreactive CD4 T
cells via recognizing the surface class-Ib MHC molecules (Qa-1 in mice and HLA-E in humans). These CD8
Tregs express distinctive co-signaling receptors, including inhibitory Killer Ig-like receptor (iKIR), a checkpoint
that constrains the uncontrolled response of CD8 Tregs. The overall goal of this project is to leverage the
expertise we gained through the study of mice CD8 Tregs to develop clinically relevant CD8 Treg
immunotherapy. Our central hypothesis is that HLA-E-binding superagonists and iKIR inhibitors can
selectively mobilize human CD8 Tregs and promote allograft tolerance. In Aim 1, I will exploit the semi-
variant nature of HLA-E-restricted TCRs to develop a tolerogenic superagonist that specifically stimulates CD8
Tregs. This will be achieved by defining a dominant TCR used by human CD8 Tregs and reconstructing this
TCR to screen for a potent inducer from a peptide-HLA-E presenting yeast library. Using a kidney transplant
recipient's PBMCs, I will validate the efficacy of selected superagonists inducing CD8 Treg cytotoxicity against
alloreactive CD4 T cells. In Aim 2, I will study the mechanism of iKIR controlling the CD8 Treg response. I will
analyze the phosphorylation status of TCR signaling molecules and examine the change in CD8 Treg effector
capacity upon blocking the iKIR, in vitro. To investigate the role of iKIR expressed by human CD8 Tregs in
vivo, I will use a novel humanized kidney organoid transplant model we established; I will analyze the
activation of CD8 Tregs, suppression of alloreactive CD4 T cells, and prolongation of kidney organoid allograft
survival when humanized hosts are treated with an iKIR-inhibiting antibody.
Successful completion of the project can transform therapeutic strategies to achieve tolerance by suggesting a
human CD8 Treg vaccine, CD8 Treg-specific checkpoints, and a novel humanized mice model that allows
studying CD8 Treg immunotherapy, in vivo. The K08 award is necessary and sufficient to advance my niche in
catalyzing preclinical discoveries into phase-1 trials and to pursue my long-term goal of developing clinically
relevant personalized tolerogenic therapies."
10865638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Septic shock is a common, often fatal, dysregulated host response to infection that results in acute circulatory
failure. Almost all patients with septic shock either have anemia (i.e., low blood counts) on presentation or
develop anemia during hospitalization and anemia in septic shock is strongly associated with morbidity and
mortality. Almost 60% of patients with septic shock receive autologous red blood cell transfusions to treat
anemia once hemoglobin levels drop below 7.0 g/dL (threshold-based transfusion strategy). However, there is
conflicting guidance and evidence for whether all patients with septic shock and hemoglobin levels <7.0 g/dL
should receive transfusion or whether blood transfusion should be guided by additional clinical criteria beyond
hemoglobin level alone. In a recent study, we found that routine threshold-based transfusion strategies for
patients with sepsis were, on average, associated with harm. In the setting of conflicting guidance and limited
evidence of effectiveness, practice patterns for blood transfusion in septic shock are also unclear. Guided by a
Learning Health System framework that is consistent with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute's clinical trial and implementation research priorities, this proposal's objective is to improve
the effectiveness of blood transfusions during septic shock. We will (1) benchmark hemoglobin threshold-
based blood transfusion practices in patients with septic shock across United States hospitals using a novel
econometric-based approach, (2) use cutting-edge causal inference techniques to identify blood transfusion
heterogeneity of treatment effect (i.e., identify patients most, and least likely to benefit from blood transfusion),
and (3) pilot the implementation of an evidence-informed transfusion decision aid in the Boston Medical Center
Medical Intensive Care Unit. Through his comprehensive career development plan, interactions with his
excellent mentoring and advisory team, and the excellent training environment of Boston University Chobanian
& Avedisian School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, Dr. Bosch will achieve training objectives in (1)
econometrics, (2) observational comparative effectiveness and causal inference, (3) mixed methodologies (4)
hybrid implementation-effectiveness clinical trials, and (5) research team leadership that are aligned with core
competencies to train the new generation of Learning Health System researchers. Results from this mentored
proposal will fill large knowledge gaps in septic shock and transfusion medicine, will yield clinically actionable
information regarding the optimal approach to blood transfusion in critically ill patients, and will inform Dr.
Bosch's R01 application for a multicenter, pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 randomized clinical trial studying the
effectiveness of transfusion guided by decision aids."
10865531,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) disproportionately affect American Indian (AI) populations. Socioeconomic
(SE) determinants of health have gained considerable attention as critical risk factors for CMDs, and SE
inequity may be a fundamental feature underlying the disparity in CMDs observed in AIs, although this has yet
to be investigated. To comprehensively understand the role of the SE environment on CMDs pathogenesis,
investigation into the underlying biological mechanisms is needed. Epigenetic mechanisms provide a unique
opportunity to identify plausible mechanisms of this relationship, given they facilitate gene-environment
interactions. The proposed project will combine multi-level socioecological information with epigenomic and
inflammatory proteomic data to understand the complex relationship between the SE environment and
endogenous responses that may underlie CMDs and CMD-associated risk phenotypes.
This project will leverage rich data collected from the largest longitudinal, prospective cohort of AIs in the U.S.,
the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS), an extension of the original Strong Heart Study, which includes AI
communities across Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota. During the K99 phase, we will build upon
the rich data collected in the SHFS by creating personal, neighborhood and cumulative measures of SE
adversity from participants in the SHFS cohort at SHFS baseline (Visit 4; 2001-2003) and follow-up (Visit 5;
2005-2009); and we will investigate SE determinants of cardiometabolic health (Aim 1). In the R00 phase, we
will identify biologically relevant DNA methylation alterations and epigenetic aging deviations associated with
SE adversity (Aim 2), and we will integrate DNA methylomic and inflammatory proteomic data to identify a
biological signature that will better explain SE adversity-induced CMD risk (Exploratory Aim).
Dr. Dye will have a dedicated training and career development plan that will supplement the proposed research
and build his scientific capacity towards his short- and long-term goals. In addition to didactic training, Dr. Dye
will have experiential training and guidance by his mentorship and advisory team of leading experts in fields
relevant to this study. Dr. Dye will gain fundamental training in indigenous health disparities research and CMD
epidemiology (Dr. Ana Navas-Acien, primary mentor); environmental molecular epidemiology and epigenetics
(Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, co-mentor); social epidemiology and determinants of indigenous health disparities (Dr.
Mandy Fretts, advisor); and data science approaches to high-dimensional, -omics data (Zhonghua Liu,
advisor). This award will prepare Dr. Dye for an independent research career that will bridge epigenetic
epidemiology, social epidemiology, and indigenous health sciences for his long-term goals to understand the
epigenetic basis of determinants of health in indigenous and under-served communities. This project will be
useful for preventative medicine (e.g., policy and interventions) in under-served communities, and identifying
biological mechanisms will be invaluable for precision medicine (e.g., therapeutics, diagnostics, prognostics)."
10865591,"Project Summary
 The majority of the genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has yet to be identified. Even less is known
about if and how genetics influence the age of onset and rate of progression of AD. Complex forms of genetic
variation such as the ~1 million short tandem repeats (STRs) in the genome cause over 30 monogenic neurologic
diseases, but the role of STRs in AD has not been explored. Inherited expansions in STRs not only cause these
diseases, but somatic instability of these pathogenic expansions within brain tissues also contributes to earlier
age of onset and faster rates of neurodegeneration. My preliminary studies have found that STR expansions
associate with risk of AD and that they are somatically unstable in temporal lobes of patients with AD. However,
it is not known how STR expansions promote neurodegeneration and whether they associate with faster
progression of AD. This proposal will address these knowledge gaps to test the overarching hypothesis that
inherited and somatic STR expansions promote neurodegeneration in AD.
 In Aim 1, I will test whether STR expansions correlate with age of onset and rate of progression in AD. I will
use existing whole genome sequencing data in over 11,000 AD cases and controls and associate STR genotypes
with longitudinal AD phenotypes. In Aim 2, I will test whether STRs become somatically unstable in neurons from
patients with AD. I will sort neurons from multiple brain regions in the same individual and perform long-read
sequencing to test for somatic STR instability. In Aim 3, I will test whether AD-associated STR expansions
promote neurodegeneration in induced pluripotent stem cell models of AD. I will use genome engineering to cut-
back an AD-associated STR expansion in a stem cell line from an individual with AD and test for alterations in
gene expression, cell viability, and synapse formation in differentiated neurons. Together, this work will generate
unprecedented insights into how an unexplored form of genetic variation underlies neurodegeneration in AD.
 I am uniquely suited to address these questions because of my deep expertise in human genetics and
genomics in addition to my clinical expertise as a cognitive neurologist treating AD and related disorders. During
my mentored training, I will develop new skills in analyzing the genetic basis of longitudinal AD phenotypes (Aim
1), performing genomics in post-mortem AD samples (Aim 2), and genome engineering in AD induced pluripotent
stem cell models (Aim 3). My mentorship team of Dr. Jennifer Phillips-Cremins (expert in STRs, somatic
instability, and genome engineering) and Dr. Edward Lee (expert in molecular mechanisms of
neurodegeneration) are unique aligned toward these training goals. This powerful complement of skills I will
develop and the insights I will derive from this work will form the foundation for a career as a physician-scientist
uncovering the genetic and molecular drivers of neurodegeneration."
10865668,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 250 million children under age 5 (43%) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) experience delays in
development which have lasting effects on academic attainment, literacy, and economic opportunities,
contributing to adverse health. Early interventions focused on responsive caregiving, early learning, and
nutrition in this context have improved short-term health and development outcomes, however, whether these
effects persist beyond 6 years of age is largely unknown. Further, few interventions have simultaneously
targeted infectious disease prevention, another known risk factor for poor childhood development that
disproportionately impacts children in LMICs. The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to identify mechanisms
through which early WASH and nutrition interventions impact health and development, assess whether these
effects persist into adolescence, and estimate the potential impact of novel multicomponent interventions that
target multiple prevalent risk factors in early life simultaneously. The work proposes to (1) leverage data from a
large cluster randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to uncover the mechanism of impact of an
effective early water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), and nutrition intervention on middle-childhood development,
(2) use population intervention effects to identify early intervention targets that take into account baseline
prevalence of risk and the confluence of risk factors that children experience in early life, and (3) follow up
children who received the early WASH and nutrition intervention to evaluate impacts on health and
development in adolescence. This work fills critical gaps in the literature regarding how early WASH and
nutrition interventions work to improve outcomes, which combinations of interventions could lead to the largest
improvements in child development outcomes, and the impact of early WASH and nutrition interventions on
later adolescent health and development outcomes. Conducted at the University of California Berkeley, the
proposed research will be guided by an exceptional mentor team with expertise spanning epidemiologic and
biostatistical methods and adolescent health. The proposed plan builds on the applicant’s background in the
design and evaluation of interventions in early childhood by providing subject matter training in (1) late
childhood and adolescent health and development; as well as methodological training in (2) causal mediation
analysis; (3) population intervention effects and target trial emulation with observational data; and (4) best
practices in reproducible and transparent research. Combined, the training and research plan prepare the
applicant to pursue their long-term goal of conducting research to improve health and development over the life
course in low-resource global settings. Aligned with NICHD’s strategic direction to improve child and
adolescent health and the transition to adulthood, this work will inform the design of future interventions that
optimize the health and development through childhood and adolescence in the context of global poverty."
10868607,"Each year, over 1 million new patients are diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide, and over 300,000
men die of this disease. High risk PCa accounts for the vast majority of PCa deaths. The standard of care for
high risk PCa was set by RTOG 92-02, a phase III trial that demonstrated a reduction in disease recurrence
and an improvement in PCa-specific survival with radiation therapy (RT) plus long-term androgen deprivation
therapy (LTADT, 28 months), compared to RT with short-term ADT (STADT, 4 months). Despite this advance,
both overtreatment and undertreatment are acute clinical problems in this patient population. In this trial, 50%
of patients were ultimately not cured with RT + LTADT. If this subset of patients had been identified with
prognostic biomarkers, they could have received therapy more suited to their aggressive disease, including
chemotherapy and novel targeted agents. On the other hand, 30% of men were cured with RT + STADT alone,
and could have avoided 24 unnecessary months of exposure to ADT and its toxic side effects. Surprisingly,
PCa is one of the few common cancers in which molecular biomarkers are not routinely used to guide
therapeutic decisions. To address these unmet needs, we propose to develop and validate clinically useful and
cost-effective prognostic and predictive biomarkers for high-risk PCa patients treated with RT, by applying a
clinical-grade high-density oligonucleotide array on a unique set of tumor samples from three landmark phase
III trials (RTOG 92-02, 99-02, and 94-13). Our research team, combining expertise in PCa, prognostic and
predictive biomarker signature identification and validation, bioinformatics, and decision analysis, will: (1)
Optimize a prognostic classifier that integrates genomic and clinicopathologic data for PCa patients treated
with RT, allowing selection of men with high-risk PCa who would benefit from treatment intensification in future
trials, (2) Derive and validate an integrated genomic-clinicopathologic predictor of response to LTADT vs.
STADT, a therapeutic duration signature that would allow differentiation of patients who should require LTADT
vs. those who are likely to be cured with STADT alone, and (3) Determine the health benefits and cost-
effectiveness of using genomic-clinicopathologic classifiers to personalize therapy in men with high-risk PCa.
Successful completion of these aims would result in cost-effective prognostic and predictive clinical-grade
biomarkers developed on a CLIA-compliant platform that would have an immediate impact on the clinical
management of men with high-risk PCa, transforming current treatment paradigms for these patients."

Although many women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) primary cancers are successfully
treated with surgery and adjuvant anti-estrogen therapies, metastatic therapy-resistant ER+
cancers account for the majority of breast cancer related deaths. New understanding of the
biology underlying disease processes is required to develop new approaches. In this renewal
application, we build on our previous findings demonstrating dynamic reciprocity between
estrogen and features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the microenvironments of both the
primary tumor and the metastatic niche which fuel the pulmonary metastatic burden. We showed
that estrogen remodels the ECM architecture of the primary tumor, aligning collagen fibers and
increasing synthesis of ECM components associated with more aggressive cancers, and alters
ECM components in the lung metastatic niche. Moreover, we showed that this collagen alignment
signature in patient tumors correlates with inflammatory markers, including COX-2 and CD163+
macrophages, and poor prognosis. In the current proposal, we hypothesize that estrogen
orchestrates synergy among ER+ tumor cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM)/ cancer associated
fibroblasts (CAFs), and macrophages/ inflammation, to fuel primary and metastatic tumor
aggression. We will utilize our robust immunocompetent in vivo model of metastatic ER+ breast
cancer, in vitro systems, PDX models and clinical patient samples to test this hypothesis in the
following aims. Aim 1: Identify the steps in metastatic progression of ER+ breast cancer which
are altered by estrogen activity in tumor cells as well as other estrogen targets. Aim 2: Determine
how estrogen action on CAFs modifies the stromal ECM to mediate tumor progression, determine
the receptors that mediate this action, and identify ECM signatures from native stromal matrix
from ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma biopsies that instruct estrogen action on tumor cell growth
and migration. Aim 3: Determine how estrogen impacts immune metastatic mediators, including
macrophage activity and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. Aim 4: Evaluate the ability of
standard of care therapeutic approaches to reverse E2-promoted steps in metastasis and post-
treatment estrogen re-exposure to promote growth of residual pulmonary lesions, and interrogate
the interrelationships among E2-altered ECM structure, and macrophage activity/inflammation.
Our studies will illuminate the role of estrogen in dissemination and pulmonary metastatic
colonization, with implications for therapy, metastatic dormancy and recurrence of ER+ breast
cancer, and reveal potential sites for intervention."
10912071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glycyl radical enzymes (GREs) are a growing superfamily that catalyzes an impressive array of chemical
transformations critical to both human health and the environment. GREs share a common glycyl radical cofactor
which allows them to perform challenging, otherwise inaccessible chemistry; however, this simple yet effective
cofactor is extremely oxygen sensitive. Because of the anaerobic nature of these catalysts, they are prevalent
within oxygen-free environments such as the human gut, marine seeps, and crude-oil containing environments.
GREs have been implicated in liver, heart, and kidney diseases and could prove uniquely effective as
bioremediation tools and targets for biodeterioration inhibition; however, most GREs remain uncharacterized. Of
particular interest is a class of GRE known as X-succinate synthases (XSSs), which are prevalent in
hydrocarbon-degrading anaerobes. XSSs catalyze the hydroalkylation of fumarate, in which new C–C bonds are
forged between fumarate and unactivated hydrocarbon substrates. This initial hydrocarbon-activation step allows
for hydrocarbons to be further metabolized by these anaerobes. Through this mechanism, XSS-containing
organisms are able to degrade hydrocarbon pollutants in even the most recalcitrant regions for environmental
remediation. On the other hand, organisms with these enzymes also significantly contribute to microbiologically
influenced corrosion. Beyond their potential environmental significance, XSS enzymes enable challenging
chemistry and could serve as an important addition to the current C–H functionalization toolkit. The work
described here will illuminate key missing mechanistic elements of XSSs and GREs more broadly, characterize
new hydroalkylation enzymes, and explore GRE use in biocatalysis. Here, I aim to use cutting-edge cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) tools and equipment to capture never-before-seen conformations of GREs as well as
novel structures of XSS enzymes. Additionally, I aim to develop methods of installing the glycyl radical cofactor
in vitro, a feat which has not yet been accomplished for any XSS enzyme to date. In vitro installation will allow
us to probe details of hydroalkylation and activation mechanism that have been severely lacking for this class.
Lastly, I will use directed evolution to engineer XSSs as selective hydroalkylation catalysts. Collectively, this work
will provide insight into the ways in which Nature uses enzymes to achieve remarkable chemistry and will allow
us to begin to harness the powerful radical chemistry Nature has to offer. I will complete the K99 phases of Aims
1 (develop a cryo-EM pipeline for XSSs using BSS) and 2 (determine conditions for in vitro activation of XSSs)
during my postdoc in the Drennan lab at MIT. The R00 phases of Aims 1 (structural characterization of an alkyl-
SS) and 2 (directed evolution of XSSs) will take place during my independent career. During the K99 phase, I
will also develop other proposals for job applications, apply for faculty positions at research-intensive institutions,
and continue my professional development through presentations, submission of manuscripts, and outreach
activities."
10869950,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly-effective in preventing new HIV infections among gay, bisexual and
other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women (TW), but relies on engaging these high-
risk communities at multiple steps along the PrEP continuum of care. Studies show that a minority of PrEP-
eligible GBMSM are taking PrEP, and TW are less likely than GBMSM to have heard of PrEP, talked with their
provider about PrEP, used PrEP in the past 6 months, and been adherent to PrEP. An existing HIV testing and
PrEP program led by members of our study team in San Diego, CA found that over 60% of GBMSM and TW
participants eligible for PrEP were not interested in starting it; of those who did start PrEP, only 5.8% remained
on PrEP after 3 months. Clearly, innovative interventions that optimize the PrEP continuum of care for diverse
GBMSM and TW are needed. We propose here a theoretically-grounded (in the IMB model), effective, accessible
and sustainable mHealth PrEP care continuum intervention for GBMSM and TW, called eSTEP (Electronic
Support To Engage with PrEP). The eSTEP WebApp will be tailored by sexuality and gender status and include
a set of interactive components delivered before in-person HIV testing (e.g., PrEP information on the benefits of
PrEP) and after the participant tests HIV-negative and agrees to start PrEP (e.g., adherence self-monitoring).
Aim 1: Use an iterative development process to gain feedback on eSTEP content and features through
focus groups with GBMSM and TW and a community advisory board (CAB). 6 focus groups with 18-45
year-old GBMSM and TW (6 participants/group; > 50% Black/Latinx) will be conducted at 3 key points in the
intervention development cycle to create the tailored (separately for GBMSM & TW) IMB-related content and
features of eSTEP. A CAB of GBMSM (n=3) and TW (n=3) will be established to provide guidance between
rounds of focus groups. Aim 1 will culminate in usability testing among 3 GBMSM and 3 TW to finalize eSTEP.
Aim 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of eSTEP to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary impact among GBMSM and TW in preparation for a large-scale R01. 120 (50% racial/ethnic
minority) GBMSM (n=85) and TW (n=35) who report risk factors that qualify for PrEP eligibility will be randomized
(2:1) to the eSTEP intervention (n=80) or a usual HIV testing control (n=40). The eSTEP group will have
immediate access to pre-HIV testing components. All study participants will be offered free in-person HIV testing
and, if eligible, PrEP at a university-based HIV prevention and treatment clinic. eSTEP participants who begin
PrEP will unlock PrEP adherence and persistence components. Follow-up study visits will be conducted at 3-
and 6-months to collect biological, clinical, and self-reported outcomes to assess eSTEP’s feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary outcomes (HIV test completion, PrEP initiation, PrEP adherence, and PrEP
appointment attendance). Finally, 10 GBMSM and 10 TW in the intervention arm will participate in an exit
interview to gain feedback on eSTEP in anticipation of a large-scale R01 study."

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial species that causes infections of the skin, lungs, blood and
internal organs. These infections can have their onset in the community or in the health care
setting, including those caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains called methicillin-resistant S.
aureus (MRSA). About 28-50% of all people are asymptomatic carriers of this species on their
bodies. The interaction of S. aureus strains in the community and in hospitals has not been
adequately studied. While we think that S. aureus can spread from person to person in
hospitals, we are not sure how often that happens, if some strains spread more readily than
others in the hospital, and how often infections result from the S. aureus bacteria that patients
bring with them on their own bodies. Also, it is unclear how important fomites (inanimate
objects) or the bodies of healthcare workers (HCWs) are as intermediate carriers in spreading S.
aureus from patient to patient in the hospital. This study will be based on data from whole
genome sequencing (WGS) of S. aureus collected in two units at the Hospital of the University
of Pennsylvania (HUP). For 24 months, we will test all patients upon admission for S. aureus
colonization of 4 body sites. For a subset of subjects colonized with S. aureus, we will test
fomites in their hospital room for S. aureus. We will choose control patients who are not
colonized with S. aureus on admission and test their room fomites to determine what the risk
factors are for acquisition and spread of S. aureus in the hospital. Using WGS we will test all of
the bacteria causing infections on the study units to see how often specific strains spread, and
we will determine whether some genetic traits of S. aureus make them more likely to spread
and/or more likely to cause infections. In addition, each month, we will test a sample of the
noses and gloves of HCWs on study units to see if they carry S. aureus. We will test common
areas of these units to see if fomites carry S. aureus. We will determine if any of the spreading
S. aureus strains are found on HCWs or common-area fomites. We will examine all infecting S.
aureus isolate genomes from the entire 850-bed HUP during an overlapping 2-year period to
identify evidence for distant spread of S. aureus causing an infection. We hope to better
understand the genetic markers of virulence and transmissibility in S. aureus. We will test the
hypothesis that strains of S. aureus that spread develop a distinct collection of plasmids, which
are mobile genetic elements coding for antibiotic resistance or virulence factors that S. aureus
may or may not carry. With these results, we may be able to identify patients carrying high-risk
S. aureus isolates and develop strategies to prevent the spread of this bacterium in the future."

Inhibition of Wnt Receptor Activation by the Tumor Suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli
The long-term objective of this study is to investigate how the tumor suppressor Adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) inhibits the Wnt signal transduction pathway by regulating the Wnt receptor
complex (signalosome) and to demonstrate how this can be exploited to target APC mutant colorectal
cancers (CRCs). Wnt signaling is essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance, whereas aberrant
activation of this pathway, which occurs most frequently through mutational inactivation of APC, triggers
the development of the vast majority of CRCs. In the classical model for Wnt signaling, the sole role of
APC is to destabilize the key transcriptional activator in the Wnt pathway, beta-catenin. However, our
recently published findings reveal an additional and entirely new function – APC prevents the
internalization and consequent activation of the signalosome, a novel role that is evolutionarily
conserved. We have shown that: 1) inducible loss of APC is rapidly followed by ligand-independent
signalosome activation; 2) depletion or antibody-mediated inhibition of LRP6 (a signalosome
component) inhibits the stabilization of beta-catenin, the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes,
and the proliferation of APC mutant cells; and 3) in APC mutant cells, endocytosis of Wnt receptors is
required for the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling. The goal of this project is to use in vitro, ex vivo,
and in vivo approaches to gain a better understanding of how APC inhibits signalosome activation
under physiological conditions and to determine how aberrant activation of the signalosome underlies
the consequences of APC inactivation in tumors. The three specific aims are to: 1) elucidate the
mechanism by which APC loss promotes signalosome assembly in CRC cells; 2) identify the APC
mutant CRC cells most susceptible to LRP6 inactivation; and 3) test the efficacy of LRP6 inactivation
on CRC tumorigenicity in vivo. Because the molecular mechanisms by which APC prevents the
aberrant activation of Wnt signaling are important for our understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis,
the knowledge gained from this study will aid in the development of new therapeutic strategies for the
treatment of CRC and other Wnt-driven cancers."
10869955,"ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, especially among women
with HIV. Of the 1.3 million pregnant women living with HIV, 85% use combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART),
which should significantly decrease their risk of TB. Yet pregnant women with well-controlled HIV still have a 2-
3 times greater incidence of TB than pregnant women without HIV. There is an urgent need to identify the
immune impairment responsible for the increased risk of TB in these women.
Gestational diabetes (GDM)– which affects 16% of pregnancies globally, and up to 40% of pregnancies in TB-
endemic India–likely contributes to the increased risk of TB in pregnancy, especially for women with HIV. We
base this hypothesis on the known association between HIV, diabetes (DM) and TB in non-pregnant
populations and our preliminary data on HIV, GDM and TB in pregnancy. We found HIV increases GDM
prevalence, and GDM impairs the host immune response to M. tuberculosis (Mtb).
In partnership with BJ Government Medical College in India (BJGMC), we propose a longitudinal study to fully
describe HIV’s effect on GDM risk, and GDM’s effect on the immune response to MTB in pregnancy. BJGMC
has conducted NIH clinical research for over 20 years with expertise in HIV and TB in pregnancy. We will enroll
2nd trimester women from the antenatal clinic at BJGMC in Pune, India, with additional visits at 3rd trimester,
delivery, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. Women will be screened for GDM at enrollment with
an oral glucose tolerance test. A subset comprised of all women diagnosed with GDM, and a matched number
of women without GDM, will have additional blood and placenta samples collected for flow cytometry and
cytokine studies. Enrolled women will be screened for active TB at each visit. Our specific aims are to:
1. Determine the effect of chronic HIV-induced inflammation on glucose metabolism during pregnancy
 and GDM prevalence. We hypothesize that women with HIV will have double the prevalence of GDM
 compared to women without HIV. We further hypothesize that elevated plasma TNF-a levels and decreased
 placental GLUT4 will be associated with GDM in women with HIV.
2. Determine the effect of GDM on the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response to Mtb and incident TB. We
 hypothesize that women with GDM will have a significantly higher incidence of active TB than women
 without GDM. We hypothesize that women with GDM will have suppressed Mtb-specific memory CD4+ and
 CD8+ T-cell function, with a decreased ability to activate macrophages, compared to women without GDM.
This will be the first study to determine if the pathophysiology of GDM is different in women with HIV and to
delineate the TB-specific clinical and immune sequelae of GDM for pregnant women. The results of this study
will identify pregnant women at the highest risk for active TB, improve targeted GDM screening and TB
prevention and potentially identify novel targets for GDM prevention and treatment."

The overall goal of this application is to characterize a novel protein quality control (PQC) system in mammalian
cells and to elucidate its role in tumorigenesis. Oncogenic transformation is a progressive process during which
normal cells acquire a set of traits to overcome various constraints that govern their proliferation. Here we will
test the notion that a heightened ability to remove misfolded proteins may be a new characteristic of tumor cells.
Protein folding is a challenging process in normal unstressed cells, and even more so in incipient and established
neoplastic cells, which frequently encounter high oxidative stresses that damage proteins. However, PQC
systems that remove misfolded proteins in mammalian cells and the role of these systems in tumorigenesis are
not well understood. Our lab recently found that many mammalian tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins can specifically
recognize misfolded proteins and mark them for proteasomal degradation, and that certain TRIM can also directly
activate the proteasome. Moreover, we observed that the capacity to remove misfolded proteins is markedly
increased in cancer cells due to the up-regulation of TRIMs. This higher degradation power mitigates oxidative
stress associated with oncogenic growth and permits oncogenic growth. These findings indicate TRIMs as
versatile regulators of protein quality, connect the clearance of misfolded proteins to antioxidant defense, and
suggest a previously unrecognized characteristic of tumor cells. Our central hypothesis is that TRIM proteins
constitute a major PQC system in mammalian cells that are critical for antioxidant defense and oncogenic
transformation. We propose three specific aims. First, TRIM proteins exist in a large number including over 70
in humans. To gain a comprehensive view of the TRIM system, we will systematically investigate the role of all
human TRIMs in proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins and define the molecular basis for their different
potency. Second, we will investigate how the accumulation of misfolded proteins causes high oxidative stress,
and how TRIMs ameliorate this stress through the clearance of misfolded proteins. Third, we will determine the
role of the TRIM system in cancer progression using cell and animal models. Moreover, our results suggest that
the removal of misfolded protein is highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition, which may provide an explanation
for proteasome-inhibitor-based therapies for cancer. We will test the notion that increasing production of
misfolded proteins, combined with proteasome blockage, may be highly effective in killing cancer cells.
Collectively, these aims will address critical issues pertaining to protein homeostasis and oncogenic
transformation, and will likely provide valuable information for the development of effective therapies."

The Monell Chemical Senses Center Postdoctoral Training Program, supported in part by Monell’s T32
Institutional National Research Service Award (NRSA), provides an opportunity for postdoctoral fellows to
obtain training at a center for research into the chemical senses—taste, smell and chemical irritation. The
eighteen faculty members participating in the training program have diverse scientific backgrounds and
conduct collaborative research using methods spanning many disciplines such as electrophysiology, molecular
biology, genetics, analytical chemistry, and psychophysics (applied to both humans and animals). Many Monell
trainees extend their expertise obtained in other fields to the chemical senses; the Center provides a
framework for them to apply skills learned elsewhere to chemosensory research. In addition to specialized
hands-on research training provided by faculty mentors, fellows attend instructional courses, workshops, and
Postdoctoral Journal Club meetings; they have opportunities for small-group review of data, one-on-one
assistance with clear scientific communication, and instruction on academic ethics tailored to their stage of
professional development. For each fellow, a mentoring committee composed of three faculty helps formulate
an Individual Development Plan for that fellow’s career path, tracks the fellow’s progress, helps set practical
scientific goals, suggests skill development opportunities, and provides written feedback every six months. In
response to the current pandemic, training plans have been modified to include remote-access Journal Club
meetings, seminars including an Interinstitutional Chemosensory Series, advanced training in workplace safety
including decontamination procedures, and transitioning where possible to online data collection. The training
program emphasizes teaching the skills to prepare results for publication and to write successful research
grants in an environment where faculty share common interests and trainees have access to specialized
infrastructure to study the chemical senses. During the previous funding period, Monell’s Institutional NRSA is
supporting or has supported 12 postdoctoral fellows: 4 are in training and 8 now have obtained individual
funding or have positions in academic institutions or elsewhere in the biomedical research workforce. All the
trainees have published papers in field-appropriate peer-reviewed journals or preprint archives, attended
national and/or international conferences, sought specialized training in courses and workshops, and become
familiar with standards for the responsible conduct of research (including rigor and reproducibility). Several
trainees have won awards for excellence in research; others have won competitive research grants, including
three F32 Individual NRSAs and one similar governmental award. The long-term goal of Monell’s Postdoctoral
Training Program is to train independent scientists in chemosensory biology, part of NIH’s mission to improve
the nation’s health."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse outcomes for both the mother and infant. Over
1 in 3 infants born to individuals with T2D will experience an adverse outcome, including large for gestational
age at birth, preterm birth, birth trauma, neonatal hypoglycemia, and stillbirth. Strict maternal glycemic control
throughout pregnancy is key to optimizing perinatal outcomes. This is possible with insulin pharmacotherapy,
vigilant glucose monitoring, lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise, and team-based prenatal care.
Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D experience non-medical social needs that limit their ability to
achieve glycemic control, including lack of reliable transportation to attend prenatal visits, access to resources
to engage in diet and exercise changes, and convenient methods to log self-monitored glucose values and adjust
insulin dosing. A multi-faceted provider-patient based approach is needed with proven strategies to
improve glycemic control. We propose “ACHIEVE: Successfully achieving and maintaining euglycemia
during pregnancy for type 2 diabetes through technology and coaching.” Our intervention is multi-
component, including a mobile health (mHealth) application (app), provider dashboard, DEXCOM continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM), and care team coaching for medical and social needs. This intervention empowers
Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D and their healthcare providers to achieve and maintain glycemic
control, improve access to care, and provide patient education and support. Each sub-component of the
proposed intervention is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), and emphasizes on individuals’ skills,
knowledge and beliefs, and self-efficacy to achieve glycemic control. We propose three aims: AIM 1: Develop
the tailored ACHIEVE mHealth app and provider dashboard for Medicaid-enrolled pregnant individuals with T2D
and their healthcare team through active stakeholder engagement; AIM 2: Conduct an RCT and measure the
effect of the intervention (mHealth app with CGM, provider dashboard, and care team coaching) compared to
current standard care (prenatal visits, self-monitored blood glucose, and certified diabetes care and education
specialist) on achieving glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c <6.5% in the third trimester). We hypothesize a 25%
absolute increase in the proportion of participants in the intervention group who will meet the target hemoglobin
A1c <6.5% in the third trimester compared to the standard care group; and AIM 3: Identify multi-level patient and
provider barriers and facilitators to satisfaction, engagement, and use of the intervention and its subcomponents."

To divide, move, and communicate, cells rely on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton that can rapidly assemble and
change. This is achieved by the polymerization of actin monomers into filaments, the construction of filament
networks, and the disassembly of these networks back into monomers. Cells maintain a large monomer reserve
to meet the demands of actin network assembly. Because of its size, the monomer pool was traditionally
considered to be homogeneous. However, recent work by us and others has revealed distinct subgroups of
monomers that can drive and modify actin dynamics in ways that profoundly influence cell behavior. These
discoveries have shown us that the rules of monomer polymerization are much more complex than previously
thought. Addressing this severe knowledge gap in one of the most fundamental aspects of cytoskeletal biology
is paramount to understanding how actin functions in cells. It may also finally reveal why defects in monomer
regulation are associated with neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, cardiac disease and cancer.
Most of our current knowledge about actin monomer behavior comes from solution biochemistry. However, these
types of experiments cannot reproduce the complex monomer-driven actin dynamics seen in cells. Therefore,
we are devising strategies that merge biochemical principles with cellular imaging to reveal how monomeric actin
regulates the cytoskeleton in living cells. This includes controlling protein levels with micromolar precision, using
quantitative image analysis to extract rate constants and concentrations, and employing computational models
to reveal how cellular geometry influences actin dynamics. Additionally, we are developing new tools to describe
and quantify actin ultrastructure from super-resolution images. We will use these innovative approaches to
address the following fundamental knowledge gaps about monomer-driven actin dynamics: 1) How monomers
control the dynamics of complex actin networks, 2) How cell geometry contributes to monomer-regulated actin
dynamics, and 3) Novel roles for monomers in the regulation of cellular processes."

Access to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the first-line treatment for disorders characterized by recurrent
binge eating (i.e., eating large amounts of food within a discrete-time period, characterized by a sense of loss
of control) is limited. CBT for binge eating is intensive (16-20 sessions), expensive ($1,882 per patient), and
requires access to clinicians with specialized training. Self-help CBTs for binge eating are accessible and cost-
effective, however, outcomes are best when the self-help treatment is paired with periodic contact with a highly
trained clinician. Clinicians likely improve outcomes because they are trained to utilize specific behavior
change techniques for facilitating improvements in two key treatment targets including treatment adherence
and skills utilization during self-help CBT program. Given the limited availability of expert clinicians, it is critical
to understand how to enhance outcomes from self-help CBTs without clinician involvement.
Recent technological advancements have shown the potential to closely approximate the behavior change
techniques typically implemented by expert clinicians to enhance treatment adherence and skills utilization
during self-help CBT without clinician involvement. In particular, technology-based intervention factors such as
Advanced Digital Data Sharing with Coaches and Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) have shown
promise in emulating behavior change techniques used by an expert clinician. Advanced Digital Data Sharing
systems can perform key behavioral tasks typically accomplished by expert clinician (e.g., identify areas for
intervention and generate recommendations on how to intervene on target behaviors). Coaches (individuals
with bachelor’s degree in health-related fields) may use the recommendations generated by this system and
provide support to patients via weekly emails for improving treatment adherence and skills utilization. Thus,
Advanced Digital Data Sharing system may allow coaches to function in a more skilled way without receiving
extensive training in behavior change techniques. JITAIs are a smartphone intervention design that conducts
real-time analysis of behavioral data related to treatment targets and determines the time of delivery and
content of momentary interventions designed to improve treatment adherence and skills use. To date, no study
has tested whether these technology-based intervention factors can independently and synergistically improve
treatment targets and outcomes from self-help CBTs for binge eating without clinician involvement.
The proposed study will use a full factorial design with 76 individuals with binge eating to identify the
independent and combined synergistic efficacies of two intervention factors (i.e., Advanced Digital Data
Sharing with Coaches and JITAIs) hypothesized to 1) improve treatment adherence and skills utilization, and
2) enhance treatment outcomes when combined with a self-help CBT program without clinician involvement.
Results of the study will inform development of effective and highly disseminable self-help CBT program for
binge eating."
10894092,"Abstract
The cellular environment is heterogeneous. Some intracellular domains are now thought to arise due to
weak attractive interactions between lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, leading to emergent domains
much larger than individual components. Such phase-like behavior has been implicated in a range of
processes from synapse structure, to signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. While it is
appealing to speculate that these domains play a role in integrating signals and other cellular information,
we cannot presently formulate the precise contributions these domains make to function. My group seeks
to understand the new physical and biological principles that determine function in the gap in scale
between all-atom molecular dynamics and established coarse-grained systems biology approaches.
We will seek to understand the thermodynamics and physical underpinnings of domains in the cellular
environment. We will build minimal models for domain forming membranes interacting with cytoplasmic
droplets, motivated by synapses, and the diverse signaling platforms which often involve partitioning and
localization of both membrane bound and cytoplasmic factors in close proximity. To this end we will use
and extend the established theory of wetting transitions, which has mostly been developed in the context
of solid homogeneous surfaces, and we will connect our theoretical predictions to experiments being
performed by collaborator Veatch’s laboratory, and to other results in the literature. We will also
investigate the ramifications of the high dimensionality of the space of protein and lipid abundances for
phase behavior in cells, seeking strategies cells could use to navigate this space, and making predictions
that can be verified with lipidomics and proximity labeling techniques. We will also investigate how driving
from active cellular components can alter domain forming behavior.
We will also investigate how thermodynamically driven domain can shape biological function at the level
of individual proteins and interaction networks, combining established thermodynamic simulation
techniques with non-equilibrium kinetic networks. We will investigate how the presence of domains can
alter the function of established interaction motifs as well as strategies that explicitly depend on the
propensity of the cellular environment to phase separate. We will quantify how domains could aid in the
amplification and distribution of small signals and investigate whether domain formation could act as an
effective analogue to digital converter. We will apply these ideas to the regulation of ion channels by
membrane domains, especially in synapses, comparing with experiments in progress by Veatch.
These projects will be significant in that they will provide deep insight into the role that phase behavior
plays in determining cellular heterogeneity and in shaping function. The proposed work will have broad
impacts for many researchers seeking to navigate a rapidly expanding field."

10894241,"ABSTRACT
 Advances in screening and adjuvant therapy have significantly improved disease outcomes in primary
(early-stage) cancer, however 30% still experience relapse despite curative treatment. Recurrent (metastatic)
disease is currently incurable. Thus, effective strategies to prevent disease recurrence in those patients at
highest risk are of major clinical importance.
 Exercise therapy is a well-tolerated strategy that may also hold significant promise to control MRD in
breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Observational studies show that self-reported exercise is associated
with 20% to 60% reductions in the risk of relapse in primary breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Moreover,
these observations extend to patients with high-risk (e.g., stage 3, node positive) disease. In preclinical support
of these data, we have demonstrated exercise significantly inhibits primary tumor growth in aggressive mouse
models of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Finally, we have translated the development of exercise
interventions to the clinic with numerous prospective trials demonstrating exercise training is safe, well-
tolerated, and exhibits significant pharmacodynamic (PD) activity as illustrated by favorable alterations in the
circulating availability of multiple growth factors and hormones as well as inflammatory-immune effectors
known to affect cancer cell proliferation and survival in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Collectively, the
encouraging data strongly support further clinical investigation of whether exercise has adjuvant therapy
benefit in patients with primary solid tumors.
We will conduct a phase 1a/1b study of exercise in primary cancer patients at high-risk of disease
relapse. We will leverage analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to: (1) identify those at high-risk of relapse,
and (2) monitor therapeutic response to exercise. This grant has two specific aims: (1) Aim 1: Phase 1a Dose-
Finding and (2) Aim 2: Phase 1b Dose Expansion."

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic inflammatory esophageal disorder characterized clinically by
esophageal dysfunction (vomiting, pain, dysphagia, and food impaction); histologically by esophageal
eosinophilia, epithelial hyperplasia, and dilated intercellular spaces associated with impaired barrier function;
and by a high degree of heritability. Most genetic studies have focused on analyzing common genetic variants
by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with evidence implicating the calpain 14 (CAPN14) and thymic
stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which are notably both expressed by the same relevant cell type, esophageal
epithelial cells. Recently, we have performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on EoE multiplex families and
identified a set of rare genetic variants involved in EoE. Though recent research progress provides the evidence
for EoE genetic etiology being linked to genetic variants, testing single genetic variants separately does not
consider the complex interaction landscape of genes. Our central hypothesis is that a subset of EoE results
from the combination of multiple variants in the same biological pathways. This study will statistically and
experimentally evaluate combinatory effects and how the genetic variants are contributing to EoE and will
develop risk scores based on the biological pathways to predict EoE by using recently developed innovations
(e.g., WES, GWAS, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ex vivo disease modeling [esophageal organoids and organotypic
culture]). In the attached proposal, we have outlined an integrated set of multidisciplinary studies with the
necessary statistical and experimental support to evaluate the impact of the combinatory effects among EoE
genetic variants. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the risk for EoE will be increased by the combinatory
rare-rare variants, rare-common variants/SNPs, and biological pathways. To determine the impact on the risk
for EoE, we will jointly analyze combinatory effects at variant, gene, and pathway levels. In Aim 2, we will test
the hypothesis that DSP and PPL rare variants have combinatory effects on esophageal barrier functions and
gene/protein expression. To explore the operational mechanisms, we will examine whether these variants have
combinatory effects using ex vivo, 3-dimensional culture models (e.g., esophageal organoids, organotypic
culture) of EoE. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the synthesis of genetic and genomic data will
lead to the ability to predict who is at risk of developing EoE, its disease features, and/or response to therapy.
Aim 3 will serve as the foundation for a future R01 application to conduct a mechanistic study to characterize the
impact of convergent genes/pathways and a case-control study to further validate and explore the clinical utility
of risk scores. The proposed study will address an unmet medical need as outlined by a recent NIH workshop,
providing insight into disease genetic mechanisms and thereby potentially contributing to personalized medicine,
especially the application of enhanced screening or preventive therapies."
10914302,"Project Summary
 In eukaryotic organisms, transcribed RNA is processed from precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) into
mature RNA in a process known as splicing. During this RNA processing mechanism, the non-coding regions of
pre-mRNA are removed, and the flanking regions are joined by a large molecular machine known as the
spliceosome. Spliceosomes do not exist pre-assembled into splicing active conformations. Instead, splice sites
(SS) are specifically chosen through the stepwise assembly of five small nuclear ribonuclear protein complexes
consisting of a small nuclear RNA and a large number of associated proteins. These spliceosome assemblies
are charged with correctly identifying and juxtaposing splice sites that are not explicitly sequence encoded in the
pre-mRNA. Adding to the complexity of splice site selection, >90-95% of human pre-mRNAs are alternatively
spliced by varying the configuration of which regions are joined and which are removed from multi-exon
containing genes. Splicing errors associated with alternative usage of splice sites are implicated in a large
number of human diseases such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (alternative 5'SS), dilated
cardiomyopathies (alternative 3'SS), Myelodysplastic syndromes (altered 3'SS preference) and early-onset
Parkinson Disease (cryptic splice site usage). Despite decades of research to characterize splicing mechanisms,
the mechanisms that control splice site usage are incompletely understood. To fill this knowledge gap, the long-
term goal of the candidate is to characterize the mechanisms that control splice site selection and the splicing
factors involved. In this project, I propose to investigate protein-driven RNA rearrangements during splicing
catalysis using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy methods through three specific aims. In aim 1, I will
implement a single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) approach to characterize a conserved
spliceosome rearrangement driven by the Prp22 helicase that leads to displacement of ligated mRNA from a
conserved region in the spliceosome catalytic core, U5 snRNA loop 1. A Prp22 variant will be used to stall
spliceosomes onto a surface immobilized pre-mRNA just after exon ligation but prior to release from the
spliceosome. Prp22-driven displacement of the ligated mRNA will subsequently be monitored using fluorescent
reporters installed on U5 snRNA loop 1 and the RNA substrate, respectively. Specific Aims 2 and 3 propose the
investigation of a human-specific protein, FAM32A, hypothesized to stabilize the interaction between the 5' exon
and U5 loop 1 in order to facilitate ligation to the 3' SS. Together, this work will answer questions about conserved
and metazoan-specific mechanisms involved in the late stages of pre-mRNA splicing catalysis. This project will
advance the applicant's career goal of running an independent laboratory at an academic institution in a way
that combines her graduate training in mechanistic enzymology with her ongoing postdoctoral training in RNA
molecular biology and biophysics to characterize the mechanisms and assembly of complex macromolecular
machines whose proper functions are vital to human health."

The goal of the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine
(UMMSM) is to provide a rich, supportive and inclusive training environment that fosters the development of
diverse, highly motivated and goal-oriented physician scientists who will pursue careers matching state of the
art research with evidence-based medicine. The Miller School is fully positioned to ensure the success of the
MSTP. The continuous expansion of basic and clinical funded research, the establishment of several new NIH
funded Centers and training grants, the Institutional investment in new infrastructure and core facilities over the
last 10 years, as well as Miami’s diverse population and access to Latin America & the Caribbean, make
UMMSM an outstanding place for MSTP training. Students are recruited from colleges and universities
throughout the US and are selected through a holistic review process that focuses on research experience,
character, and passion for a dual research and medicine career. South Florida’s unique demographics has
been a key element in the recruitment of a diverse MSTP student body, which has 36% of trainees
underrepresented in medicine (26% underrepresented minorities). The award of a MSTP T32 in 2017 has
increased the number and quality of our applications and has also facilitated stronger institutional and
programmatic leadership support, resulting in a 30% increase in the program size in 5 years. The Program is
well integrated with the newly established UMMSM NextGenMD curriculum that highly values scholarly
activities. This curriculum allows MSTP students to complete their dual degree in 7-8 years, and effectively
incorporates PhD training after exposure to both preclinical coursework (14 months) and clinical clerkships (1st
6 months). Students are able to select among PhD training programs in eight interdisciplinary Programs in
Biomedical Sciences, as well as Programs in Public Health Sciences and Biomedical Engineering. Graduate
training that confers the development of competencies needed to carry out rigorous and ethical research and
MSTP support of formal training to enhance productive mentor-mentee relationships are complemented by a
series of other MSTP activities enhancing skills necessary to build a solid physician scientist unique identity.
These include a journal club for MSTP students in their early years of medical school, longitudinal clinical
experiences during graduate training which includes exposure to clinical research related activities, and
student-led activities that bring together all MSTP students, such as monthly Scientific & Professional
Development Workshops, monthly Clinical Case Reviews, annual MSTP Student Research Symposium,
annual Retreat and other career development and social activities. Measurable outcomes of the program
include, among others, strong publication records, high success rates of NRSA fellowship applications, and
excellent residency matches. Overall the MSTP provides an integrated training experience that fosters a true
culture and passion for learning how to generate and translate innovative research to medicine."

 This T32 renewal application requests funds over five years to support six (6) predoctoral traineeships in
population research at the Center for Demography and Ecology (CDE) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Since 1962, CDE has offered a world-class training program in population science, with nearly continuous
NICHD T32 funding since 1975. Our graduates are among the leaders in population research today, serving in
a range of academic, government and applied research settings. Guided by the NICHD mission “to ensure the
health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people,” CDE research is organized around five major
areas: 1) Fertility, families & households; 2) the Demography of inequality; 3) Health and the lifecourse; 4)
Biodemography; and 5) Environmental and spatial demography. Our training objectives—and associated
research activities—fall squarely under the Population Dynamics Branch which “supports research, data
collection, and research training in demography, reproductive health, and population health.”
 The primary goals of the CDE training program in demography are: (1) to foster an interdisciplinary
community of junior scholars in population research; (2) to build expertise in demographic theory, methods,
and analysis; and (3) to cultivate students’ professional skills, including the organization, execution,
presentation, publication, and critique of research. Within the CDE training program, the process of developing
this expertise involves four essential components: (1) formal training via coursework in students’ home
departments and interdisciplinary coursework in other departments; (2) exposure to cutting-edge research of
scholars in the broader community of population studies, primarily through the weekly Demography Seminar
(‘DemSem’); (3) participation and collaboration in substantive research projects of CDE training faculty through
an apprenticeship model; and (4) professional socialization and integration into the field of population studies,
especially via the weekly Demography Training Seminar.
 Predoctoral T32 trainees are typically appointed in year 2 or 3 of their PhD program, having shown clear
academic promise and a strong commitment to pursuing a population research career; most students come
from Sociology, Economics and Population Health, although we are increasingly recruiting from a broader
range of disciplines. They typically receive T32 funding for two to three years. We are requesting 6 predoctoral
training slots (1 more than our current allocation) because our program has continued to grow in size, scope
and quality. Our training efforts have expanded to focus on interdisciplinary research areas at the forefront of
social science, especially biodemography and spatial/environmental demography, and we have been
successful at recruiting even larger numbers of highly-competitive students into our broader training program. A
critical mass of T32 traineeships ensures that we can continue to support our most outstanding students in
what we believe is one of the best available environments for predoctoral training in population research."

The 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendation of “Understanding the
Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention” as a key strategic plan to treat and
prevent Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) by 2025. Exposure to extreme
weather-related events, air pollution, and environmental contaminants are pervasive, yet little is
known about their relationships with ADRD, especially among a diverse older population. The
proposed study addresses critical gaps in the literature by linking residential history on a diverse
sample of over 3,379 individuals from 3 ongoing NIH-funded cohort studies (Kaiser Healthy Aging
and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE, n=1712, mean age 76.2, 71% non- White), the Study of
Healthy Aging in African-Americans (STAR, n=764, mean age 68.4, 100% non-White) andLife After
90 (LA 90, n=903, mean age 92.7, 72% non-White)) to newly collected data on environmental
exposures and will generate new granular, comprehensive, lifecourse measures of environmental
exposures that will be used to examine their association with ADRD. All studies conduct
harmonized neurocognitive assessments, clinical exams and neuroimaging, collect information on
lifecourse risk factors, and are linked to health data (1960s-1990s) and electronic medical records
(1996-present). Residential history at seven time points is collected (birth-current), and will be
geocoded and linked to historic exposure data. The overall objective of this studyis to investigate
exposure to extreme weather-related events, air pollution, and toxic environmental contaminants on
cognitive function, ADRD, and neuroimaging biomarker in diverse aging populations. In a unique
and unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively evaluate environmental exposures on late-life
brainoutcomes, this study will address the following among 3,379 diverse Northern California
residents: (1) Test the associations between exposure to extreme weather-related events (extreme
heat, drought, wildfire) on neuroimaging markers, cognitive decline, and ADRD; (2) Determine the
associations between exposure to ambient particulate air pollution (fine and ultrafine particulate

relationships between exposure to toxic environmental contaminants (lead, mercury) on
neuroimaging markers, cognitive decline, and ADRD. Leveraging cumulative and time-dependent
exposure to these environmental factors will illuminate lifecourse period in which exposureto these
environmental factors is especially salient to healthy brain aging. Findings from this study have the
potential to uncover new risk factors for ADRD and cognitive decline, and provide targets of ADRD

Women with germline variants in breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer predisposition genes are at significantly
elevated risk of developing these cancers in their lifetime. Clinical hereditary cancer genetic testing for
pathogenic variants in these genes has become an important part of clinical practice. Much of the benefits of
genetic testing are associated with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes because of the risk management, surgical
prevention and targeted treatment benefits associated with knowledge of the presence of a cancer predisposing
pathogenic variants. However, identification of pathogenic variants in other predisposition genes including ATM,
BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C and RAD51D is also clincially meaningful because carriers may
qualify for enhanced screening for breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. However, this process is often
complicated by an inability to establish the clinical relevance of variants in these genes. This lack of information
about these variants means that individuals carrying germline variants often cannot benefit from enhanced risk
assessment and management or make informed decisions about surgical prevention or tailored treatment
options. To address this issue we have developed a ClinGen BRCA1/2 Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP)
and a Hereditary Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic (HBOP) VCEP. We will develop ACMG-like rules-based
methods for variant classification in each of the genes described above and apply these rules to classification of
observed variants in these genes. Thus, the Aim of this application is to curate and classify the clinical
relevance of germline variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 through a BRCA1/2 VCEP and variants in ATM,
BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C and RAD51D through the HBOP VCEP. The results from the
proposed curation efforts will be entered into the ClinGen Variant Curation Interface and made available to the
public through the ClinVar and BRCA Exchange websites."

Alternative splicing processes over 95% of human mRNA and enables a single gene to encode
distinct protein isoforms of different functions. Dysregulation of alternative splicing causes
incorrect selection of exons and consequently various human diseases. Alternative exons are
selected in early-stage spliceosome assembly. Due to our limited knowledge about early-stage
spliceosome assembly, it is still challenging to develop therapies for diseases related to
aberrant RNA splicing. Early-stage spliceosome assembly involves selection of exons and
recruitment to the splicing sites of ribonucleoprotein complexes U1 and U2. These processes
depend on the interplay of Ser/Arg-rich proteins (SR), U1-70K and U2AF-35. SR proteins are
the key factors that coordinate all these events. The SR family consists of 12 members and
shares Arg-Ser repetitive regions (RS) that are subjected to phosphorylation. In this proposal,
we have selected the prototype of the family, SRSF1, as a model to investigate the central roles
of SR proteins in spliceosome assembly. Mounting cellular studies have shown that SRSF1
promotes inclusion of exons by binding to exonic splicing enhancer RNA motifs, and
phosphorylation of SRSF1 regulates not only the overall splicing pattern, but also the
spliceosome assembly. Despite the progress in cellular studies, elucidating the mechanisms by
which phosphorylation of SRSF1 regulates exon selection and spliceosome assembly is
challenging due to low solubility of SR proteins, U1-70K and U2AF-35. Our lab has obtained all
three of these proteins in the soluble full-length form. With this success, we have found that the
SRSF1 RS region (a) displays RNA-binding preference and its phosphorylation inhibits RNA
binding; (b) is essential for interaction with U1-70K and U2AF-35, which are responsible for
recruitment of U1 and U2 complexes, respectively; (c) mediates phase separation, which is
consistent with its role in organizing nuclear speckles. This proposal will (1) use the high-
throughput method RNA Bind-n-Seq to systematically investigate how phosphorylation
regulates RNA-binding specificity of SRSF1; (2) use a combination of NMR, molecular dynamic
simulations and other biophysical methods to elucidate the structural mechanism by which
SRSF1 interacts with U1-70K and U2AF-35; (3) investigate how the RS region balance its roles
in modulating RNA-binding affinity, mediating protein interactions, and organizing phase
separation in the phase-separated state. In summary, our proposal will advance our knowledge
of exon selection and splicing factor interaction during early-stage spliceosome assembly."

spermatogenesis, where epigenetic changes occur as germ cells transition from precursor to sperm.
Successful execution of the meiotic program necessitates the induction and repair of DNA double-strand
breaks to enable recombination between homologous chromosomes. Several factors involved in repairing DNA
damage in somatic cells are also involved in male meiosis. Chromatin-remodeling complexes, in addition to
regulating gene regulation, also play a role in DNA repair, regulation of gene expression, and meiotic sex

10886903,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research Project: Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age. The
economic impact of symptomatic uterine fibroids in the United State is estimated to be nearly $34 billion annually.
The incidence of these tumors is age and race dependent and has been estimated to be detected in up to 80%
of women by age fifty. Genetic mutation appears to contribute to fibroid tumorigenesis, and two altered genes,
the high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) and mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12), are observed in
approximately 85% of all fibroids. A major gap in knowledge is to define the functional role of these mutations in
myometrium and determine if they are sufficient to induce a fibroid phenotype. Studies have described the
transcriptomic and methylation profiles of uterine fibroids showing a strong divergence between subtypes, which
supports an underlying difference in the establishment of the tumors. Understanding the functional role of each
mutation is necessary to design new therapeutics in pursuit of personalized medicine. Here, I propose to study
the role of the two major fibroid mutations, by over-expression of HMGA2 or by induction of a MED12 point
mutation in human primary myometrial cells. My central hypothesis is that over-expression of HMGA2 or MED12
mutation is each sufficient to induce a fibroid phenotype and that exploiting their transcriptome differences will
allow us to identify effective therapies specific to each subtype. In this application, I propose to 1) Determine the
functional roles of HMGA2 over-expression and MED12 mutation in uterine fibroids 2) Predict and test drug
compounds to target each of the two major fibroid subtypes using a spheroid model 3) Design in vitro assays
and test compounds by high throughput screening.
Career Goals: My Ph.D. is in pharmacology and toxicology, and I discovered that metallic nanoparticle exposure
during pregnancy can cross the placental barrier and impair normal fetal development. I became more interested
in women’s reproductive health during my postdoctoral training in Dr. Teixeira’s laboratory and made some
seminal discoveries. I found differential gene expression in the myometria of patients with fibroids compared to
those without fibroids and discovered transcriptomic differences in the myometria of Black and White women
that could be related to the racial disparity of these disease. I have also identified a novel myometrium stem cell
marker. My goal is to secure a tenure-track faculty position within an Academic Medical Center and develop in
vitro and in vivo models to test drugs for personalized therapeutics.
Career Development and Environment: The K99/R00 award will provide me the necessary training in drug
discovery using omics-data and high throughput screening to become a successful independent investigator. My
mentors will be Drs. Jose Teixeira, Bin Chen and Richard Neubig. Dr. Darlene Taylor is a specialist in the design
and synthesis of drug delivery systems and will serve as a collaborator. The diverse departments at Michigan
State University are ideal for me to complete the training to uncover novel specific and personalized therapies."
10887006,"Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are the leading cause of death in children under 5 years old. There is
a high prevalence of pediatric ALRI-related hypoxemia in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Building
on past successes, this proposal aims to advance the use of pulse oximetry in LMICs. In Malawi a SpO2
(peripheral oxygen saturation) of 90-92% was associated with child ALRI mortality which is consistent with a
retrospective study from the United States that reported SpO2 may over-estimate arterial oxygen saturation
(SaO2) by 4.3% in Black children. Pulse oximeters are not universally available in outpatient settings in LMICs
due to a lack of health system financing. Government stakeholders often must prioritize low, or perceived, low
cost high output interventions. However, the cost of pulse oximetry implementation in these settings remains
unknown. For outpatient pulse oximeters to reduce child ALRI mortality, they must accurately and reliably
measure SpO2 and be financially and time cost effective.
The aims of this mixed methods study are to 1) examine the accuracy of SpO2 in children with dark and fair skin
tones and 2) compare the costs of ambulatory reflectance versus transmissive pulse oximetry implementation
for outpatient child ALRI care in South Africa. These aims address the NHLBI's mission to lead the world in
advancing translational research that bridges the gap between clinical research to practice and population to
health outcome.
Interventions to improve early identification of hypoxemic children and provision of appropriate care are critical
to reduce child ALRI mortality. This proposal leverages the unexplored roles of cost analysis and compares
objective findings with clinician perceptions of time-costs in pulse oximetry use and generates critical racial health
disparity-related data to inform future studies aimed at improving equitable care and treatment by refining SpO2
interpretation.
Dr. Hooli is a pediatric emergency medicine physician with years of clinical experience in LMICs and the United
States. These experiences framed the aims and shaped her career focus on patient-oriented research. The
educational plan includes formal, tutorial, and practical experiences in prospective study design and analysis,
cost analysis, and implementation science. She is mentored by internationally recognized scientists with
expertise in these fields and child pneumonia, global health, and pulse oximetry. Execution of these aims coupled
with the educational and mentorship plan outlined in the proposal will prepare Dr. Hooli to become an
independent investigator."

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may begin in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The overall goal of this research is to
identify intestinal pathogenic mechanisms in PD that may lead to the identification of gut-biomarkers for early
diagnosis as well as gut-directed therapies to halt progression of disease in the premotor phase. The proposed
research addresses the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium causes PD via
the gut brain immune axis through two specific aims. The first aim will determine the role of mitochondrial
dysfunction in mediating the response of the intestinal epithelium to enteric neuron pathologic α-Synuclein.
This will be accomplished through measurement of inflammation and mitochondrial stress in duodenal tissue,
isolated crypts and intestinal organoids from a PD model (mice over-expressing human α-Synuclein). In
addition, these measures will be evaluated in wild type organoids treated with conditioned media from
organotypic cultures of the enteric nervous system in the same PD model. The second aim will test the
hypothesis that impaired mitophagy in the intestinal epithelium causes persistent central pathology and motor
deficits in a gut-seeding PD model. This will be accomplished through duodenal injection of α-Synuclein
preformed fibrils in mice with intestinal epithelial-specific Parkin knockout and wild type mice.
This proposed research will provide Dr. Elizabeth Videlock, a board-certified Gastroenterologist, with training in
the research skills necessary to study the gut-brain axis in PD. This technical training is a component of a
comprehensive career development plan designed to facilitate her transition to independence. Her mentorship
team is led by Nigel Maidment, Professor of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, who has extensive
experience studying dopamine neurotransmission in rodent models of PD and a strong track record in
mentoring trainees to independence. Co-mentors will provide mentorship in assessment of the enteric nervous
system (Million Mulugeta), intestinal organoids (Martin G. Martin), and leadership skills (Lin Chang). In
addition, an advisory panel will provide mentorship for content related to the role of the gut in PD (Yvette
Taché, Michael Camilleri) and mitochondrial morphology and metabolism in epithelial cells (Leanne Jones,
Rajat Singh). The strength of the clinical and basic science programs in metabolism, neurodegenerative
disease and the gut-brain axis make UCLA the perfect institution to support this interdisciplinary proposal."
10888983,"BIOMARKER DISCOVERY LAB ABSTRACT
Increases in the use of computed tomography (CT) for lung cancer (LC) screening and other indications has
dramatically multiplied the detection of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs), resulting in a clinical
management challenge. The estimated annual US prevalence of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules was
1.57 million persons. The number of nodules will continue to increase given the widespread use of CT and the
new recommendations that expand the screen-eligible population for annual low-dose CT screening. In patients
presenting with screen or incidentally detected IPNs, the goal is to rapidly identify and treat malignant nodules
while avoiding unnecessary follow-up or invasive procedures. However, discriminating between benign and
malignant nodules is challenging especially among intermediate-risk IPNs where the clinical management is the
most variable and false positivity rates are high. There is an urgent and unmet need to develop biomarkers to
better risk-stratify intermediate risk IPNs to improve and standardize clinical management. The focus of this
Biomarker Discovery Lab (BDL) is to develop, refine, and validate non-invasive nasal gene expression,
circulating tumor cell (CTC), and CT image-based biomarkers in both screen and incidentally detected IPNs of
intermediate-risk. The goal of the BDL biomarkers is to transition a subset of intermediate-risk IPNs to 1) low-
risk where they can be followed with CT surveillance or 2) high-risk where histologic sampling is commonly
performed. We hypothesize that integrated biomarkers combining clinical, molecular, and imaging data as well
as longitudinal measurement of biomarkers (during follow-up surveillance) will maximize the stratification of
patients with intermediate-risk IPNs into these clinically actionable groups. To achieve our goals, we have
partnered via the Biomarker Reference Lab with two industrial partners and an academic advanced image
analysis laboratory. Each of the industrial partners have CLIA-LDT tests for early detection of lung cancer that
will be further validated in the setting of intermediate-risk IPN and tested as longitudinal biomarkers in large and
unique cohorts of screen and incidentally detected IPNs. The BDL collaboration is designed to meet the goal of
significantly changing the risk stratification and clinical management of IPNs."

The Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) of the BU-UCLA Lung Cancer Biomarker Characterization Center
(BCC) will work to ensure that the biomarkers developed and evaluated by our Biomarker Discovery Lab (BDL)
can be robustly measured in the clinical setting using material collected and analyzed using CLIA-lab protocols.
Like the BDL, the BRL will be organized into analyte specific teams. Reference Lab studies will be performed in
collaboration with our industrial partners for the nasal gene expression, circulating tumor cell (CTC) and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) biomarkers, and at the UCLA Imaging Biomarker Reference
Laboratory (IBRL) for the imaging biomarkers. Each entity within the BRL has had a long-standing collaboration
with our BDL teams. The BRL will also assess biospecimen, imaging and molecular data quality and convey that
information to the collecting sites and the BDL to ensure that all sites are collecting high quality specimens and
generating high quality data. The goals of these collaborative efforts are to rigorously assess the validity of
candidate biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer that are identified in the BDL, and develop either
refined algorithms that currently exist in our commercial partners’ laboratories or novel CLIA assays that can
emerge in the commercial marketplace for clinical use. The major goals are that these tests have high
reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity."
10889005,"ABSTRACT
Elucidating the underlying genetic causes of the awesome phenotypic diversity observed in natural
populations is a major challenge in biology. Despite the importance of understanding the genetic basis of
complex traits, we currently lack complete knowledge of the relevant genetic components. Genetic variation
affecting the structure and copy number of chromosomal segments is an underappreciated component of the
genetic architecture. In this proposal, we seek to obtain a species-wide view of structural variation (SV) and
copy number variation (CNV) and how these contribute to the phenotypic landscape of natural populations. In
order to accomplish this, we will take advantage of the genetic workhorse Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for which
we have recently completed whole genome resequencing of 1,011 natural isolates, plus accompanying large
scale phenotyping efforts. CNVs are frequent in our strain collection and have outsize phenotypic affects in the
association tests we have so far completed. We propose to: Aim 1. Apply long read sequencing to better
characterize the structural variation present in these strains and generate high quality de novo assemblies. In
Aim 2, we will collect quantitative strain phenotypes over a large panel of environmental conditions, with a
particular emphasis on conditions that we and others have found to be particularly sensitive to CNVs. We will
also include molecular traits such as mRNA and protein abundance. We will then perform association testing
with the variants discovered in Aim 1 in order to determine over an entire species the degree to which SVs and
CNVs contribute to trait variation. Since association methods perform poorly for rare genetic variants, we will
in Aim 3 use a diallel panel where controlled crosses allow us to better survey all variation present. Finally, in
Aim 4 we will complement our work on naturally occurring variation by building libraries of engineered
variants. We will create large dosage series pools of segmental amplifications and deletions to better
understand their consequences across multiple genetic backgrounds. Our work will result in a more complete
understanding of the complexities of the genotype-phenotype connection with respect to this important but
understudied class of genetic variants."
10889007,"The vast majority of the 20 human connexin isoforms have been associated with pathological
dysfunctions, suggesting an essential physiological role for these proteins in human health.
Although connexin channels are permeable to both atomic ions and small metabolites, they are
highly selective to different molecules, which likely determines their distinct biological functions.
They are also regulated by various stimuli, including Ca2+, voltage, and pH. Our understanding,
however, of the molecular mechanisms underlying permeation and gating is extremely superficial,
especially when compared with other classical ion channels. Recently, we made the surprising
discovery that connexin hemichannels (and other large-pore channels) are not passive diffusion
pores for molecules. Instead, they display saturation suggesting binding sites in the permeation
pathway that might determine selectivity in a similar manner to transporters/carriers. Additionally,
published and preliminary data from our lab suggested a major role for the N-terminal (NT)
domain, which lines the channel pore, in permeation of molecules and pore occlusion. Thus, we
hypothesize that the NT in connexin hemichannels serves: (1) as a critical energetic barrier for
transport of molecules and (2) as the gate for controlling ionic conduction. In this proposal, we
focus on two connexins, Cx26 and Cx30, in which human mutations at the NT are associated with
deafness and congenital skin disorders. We will identify whether these NT mutations affect
permeability, gating or both, and will provide a mechanistic basis of hemichannel dysfunction.
Novel high-resolution structures of the connexin channel have been solved, which will serve as a
guide for the proposed molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we will complement
computational data with experimental studies addressing key mechanistic questions that remain
still unanswered. Our proposal is highly significant because we are testing an innovative
hypothesis that will provide better understanding of the mechanisms of permeation and gating of
connexin channels. Importantly, this will assist in the rational development and design of drugs or
other therapeutic approaches that can specifically correct or compensate for the varied human
diseases produced by connexin protein dysfunction, including deafness and skin disorders."
10889108,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is one of the most potent and
persistent toxicants known. TCDD and other dioxin-like chemicals are primarily ingested through food, and can
cause various adverse effects ranging from immune suppression to hepatotoxicity and developmental
alterations. Despite gradually decreasing environmental and body burdens, dioxin exposure remains of
particular concern in utero, in breastfed infants, and specific populations reliant for food on locally caught fish
and wildlife. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-inducible transcription factor, mediates virtually all
of the toxic effects of dioxins. Nearly four decades after its discovery, the AHR remains an enigmatic molecule
with a variety of endogenous roles in addition to its function as an environmental sensor. Our recent analysis of
the AHR signaling network in mouse liver showed that direct AHR binding to cognate sequences in promoter
regions of target genes explains only about 10% of TCDD-induced gene perturbations. In addition, it is unclear
why humans are much less sensitive in responses to TCDD than rodents. These gaps in our knowledge make
it difficult to estimate the risks of human exposure to dioxins. Our overarching hypothesis is that tissue- and
species-specific alterations in gene expression induced by AHR activation, which in turn lead to dioxin toxicity,
are determined by a combination of local chromatin accessibility, AHR binding in gene regulatory regions, and
AHR-mediated long-range chromatin interactions. We propose to use an innovative combination of functional
genomic experiments, computational modeling, and targeted epigenome editing (CRISPRi) to develop a
predictive model for AHR-mediated tissue- and species-specific gene regulation, and to reconstruct the AHR
transcriptional regulatory network in human vs. mouse liver and B cells. We will draw on both AHR-specific
data generated in this project, and the NIH ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, which have
collectively made available 10,000+ genomic and epigenomic data sets from more than 400 human cell lines
and tissue types. In Aim 1, we will compare genome-wide chromatin accessibility of mouse and human
hepatocytes and B cells in the absence and presence of TCDD. In Aim 2, a novel predictive model for
genome-wide AHR binding will be developed based on ChIP-Seq, chromatin accessibility and histone
modification data. In Aim 3, we will identify and predict the differential expression of AHR target genes in
mouse and human from AHR binding sites in regulatory DNA and AHR-mediated long-range interactions. The
overall impact of our model will be improved mechanistic understanding of tissue-and species-specific gene
regulation by the AHR in unprecedented genome-wide detail. Our long-term goal is to develop a genome-
based quantitative framework for human risk assessment of chemicals that dysregulate core transcriptional
regulatory pathways."
10889110,"ABSTRACT
Precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression is essential to ensure normal development and
homeostasis and is achieved through multiple regulatory mechanisms acting at every step from gene
transcription to protein degradation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), constitute a large class of highly conserved
regulatory short non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
Mechanistically, miRNAs repress their targets as part of a large multicomponent ribonucleoprotein known as
the miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex (miRISC), which include Argonaute proteins (AGO) and members of the
TNRC6 family of proteins.
How miRISC assembly and activity are regulated in vivo remains poorly understood and until recently it was
tacitly assumed that miRNAs are constitutively active in all cell types. Recent work from several groups, including
ours, has challenged this assumption, revealing that assembly of the miRISC is tightly regulated in vivo, and
suggesting the possibility that in many adult tissues and in quiescent cells the bulk of miRNA-bound AGO
proteins are not bound to target mRNAs, and are not engaged in their repression.
Why many adult tissues and quiescent cells contain high levels of functionally inactive miRNAs and
whether, in addition to mitogenic cues, other perturbations—including cancer, aging, infection, and
inflammation—regulate miRISC assembly and activity are two major unanswered questions in the field
and the main focus of this grant proposal.
As a first step to address these two questions we propose a series of experiment that take advantage of a novel
genetically engineered mouse strain we have recently generated that allows to control miRISC assembly in vivo
in a temporally and spatially controlled fashion. We will use this novel mouse strain to determine the requirement
for miRISC activity during normal tissue homeostasis, in development, and during tissue regeneration (Aim 1).
In Aim 2, we will use it to directly test the hypothesis that miRISC activity is required for tumor progression and
tumor maintenance in vivo and we will determine the potential of miRISC inhibition as a novel anticancer strategy.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will take advantage of a novel mouse strain we have developed to gain mechanistic insights
into how miRNAs control these essential processes.
Successful completion of this project will greatly advance our understanding of the role of miRNA-mediated gene
repression in mammals and could lead to the development of novel anti-cancer strategies."
10889112,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Absent known deficits such as hearing loss or developmental disorder, approximately 15% of two-year-olds
nevertheless have atypically small expressive vocabularies. These “late talkers” (LTs) are at increased risk for a later
diagnosis of language disorder, and even those LTs who are not diagnosed still have poorer long-term language outcomes
as compared to their typically developing peers (TDs). At present, we do not know why some children struggle to develop
their vocabularies, and we are unable to predict which LTs are at greatest risk for language disorder.
 This project focuses on toddlers’ verb vocabularies because of the role that verbs play in developing grammar.
Difficulty with verbs is considered a warning sign for later language disorder, and children with language disorder in turn
struggle particularly with verbs. To learn new verbs, toddlers use information derived from the surrounding linguistic
context, such as sentence structure. However, this ability is predicated on preexisting knowledge of verbs. Concerningly,
our prior research indicates that LTs and TDs differ in early verb knowledge: LTs have more result verbs (i.e., verbs that
denote the result of an event, such as “break”) than manner verbs (i.e., verbs that denote how an event unfolds, such as
“run”) in their vocabularies. This pattern mimics biases for result over manner meanings observed in older children with
language disorder. However, TDs have more manner than result verbs throughout development. In contexts where verb
learning is dependent on knowledge of manner versus result meanings, LTs and TDs are likely to perform differently.
 In Aim 1/Study 1, we consider one such manipulation: Whether the sequencing of the linguistic information (i.e.,
the verb) and its referent action impacts verb learning. TDs appear to learn manner verbs best when the verb precedes the
action, but they learn result verbs best when the verb follows the action. However, older children with language disorder
better learn verbs when they follow the action, irrespective of verb meaning. We hypothesize that LTs will show the same
pattern as older children with language disorder because they also have a bias for result over manner verbs. If true, this
would be the first demonstrated verb learning difference between LTs and TDs.
 Learning a verb’s meaning from its linguistic context also requires that children be able to process the given
linguistic information. Conversely, children who do not process the linguistic context fail to learn new verb meanings. It
has been hypothesized that children who are faster linguistic processors are better verb learners, but this has not yet been
demonstrated experimentally. In Aim 2/Study 2, we consider the relationship between concurrent processing of familiar
words and performance on a verb-learning task (i.e., Study 1). We hypothesize that for both LTs and TDs, those who are
faster to process familiar words will also be better at verb learning.
 The final sample will include 52 toddlers (26 LTs; 26 TDs, ages 24.0 – 30.9 months) who will complete both
studies. Data will be collected using eye tracking, and regression analyses will be used to test our hypotheses. Results
from Aim 1/Study 1 will support future research on verb-learning interventions for LTs. Results from Aim 2/Study 2 will
provide the basis for future longitudinal studies aimed at predicting outcomes for LTs."
10889113,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The last decade has seen a devastating epidemic of opioid addiction in the U.S with the fatal opioid overdose
incidence doubling in 10 years. Genetic factors clearly contribute to addiction vulnerability, but they alone cannot
account for this rise. Therefore, environmental factors must also play role, and their enduring effects would be
maximal during sensitive/critical periods early in life. Indeed, early life adversity (ELA) is associated with opioid
addiction vulnerability, and in experimental models, it promotes such vulnerability. Although the responsible
mechanisms have yet to be elucidated, the enduring nature of changes set in motion by ELA strongly suggest
that epigenetic mechanisms may underlie these stable changes. The epigenome is a signal integration platform
superimposed on the genome, which is modified by both ELA and drugs of abuse, and which also encodes
aspects of sex differences. Epigenetic mechanisms are known to establish stable changes in cell function (via
coordinating gene regulation) that give rise to persistently altered behaviors, including drug use and drug seeking
behaviors. Thus, understanding epigenetic and transcriptional changes associated with addiction propensity
following ELA may answer several key questions about the causes and mechanisms of opioid use disorder
(OUD). For example, how is ELA epigenetically encoded, thereby increasing risk for opioid abuse and relapse-
associated behaviors? Does heroin differentially affect the epigenome and transcriptome in those with ELA
history, promoting this vulnerability? These questions will be addressed here using robust rat models of ELA and
of heroin self-administration and relapse. Capitalizing on our findings that ELA augments heroin vulnerability and
relapse in a sex-divergent manner4, consistent with human data20-23, we will test the driving hypothesis that both
ELA and initial heroin use regulate epigenomic processes, and these, in turn, coordinate gene regulation that
ultimately affects cellular signaling, and OUD-like behaviors. The epigenomic and transcriptomic changes
induced by ELA and heroin will be determined by employing both bulk- and single-cell multi-omics in selected
brain regions at different points in the OUD trajectory. They will be complemented by sampling of CSF and blood
extracellular vesicle (EV) miRNA profiles to enable potential development of predictive markers of OUD risk
and/or progression. Using state of the art sequencing and analysis methods, we will uncover gene regulatory
networks associated with ELA, initial heroin use, and heroin abuse/relapse in females and males. This approach
will allow us to identify novel targets for OUD prevention and intervention in vulnerable individuals."

fellows. Given the rapid pace and complexity of both basic and clinical research, it is imperative
to provide trainees with the requisite armamentarium of investigative skills during post-doctoral
training. The establishment of both research proficiency and a pattern of mentored training are
critical for the promotion of successful academic career pathways. Importantly, we have
configured a multidisciplinary training program to allow development of investigators along
basic, patient-oriented, clinical research or bioinformatics tracks. All four of these research
paradigms are considered crucial to the success of broad-based cancer-related investigation.
The objective of this program is to prepare general surgery and neurosurgery residents and
surgical oncology fellows in Urology, Breast and Head and Neck cancer for investigative careers
in research fields related to surgical oncology. Fellows commit at least two years to intensive
training in basic, translational or clinical research through a mentored training environment
necessary for the development of experience and proficiency in investigative techniques and
reasoning. For those interested in basic science research training, opportunities for mentored
investigation are available in the laboratories of scientists with broad interests in cancer biology.
In addition to bench research training, fellows in the basic research track will participate in
didactic course work as determined by the individual advisory committees. Pursuit of a basic
science PhD program is available. Fellows interested in patient-oriented research training may
pursue a Masters of Science in Clinical Investigation (MSCI). The MSCI program combines
broad didactic coursework with a mentored research experience focused on patient related
material or therapeutic intervention. Those interested in epidemiological or outcomes research
may pursue a Masters of Public Health (MPH). The MPH program combines didactic
coursework in clinical epidemiology with a mentored clinical research project. Finally, trainees
interested in computational science may pursue a Masters in Bioinformatics. These four
training tracks allow fellows to pursue the pathways best suited to their career objectives."
10889015,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Personal payments from the pharmaceutical industry to US physicians are common and influence physician
prescribing. Approximately 80% of medical oncologists receive personal payments from industry each year,
with a mean of over $5,500 per physician. These payments may result in differences in the quality of cancer
care delivery and potentially affect patient outcomes. Because the selection of different cancer treatments
directly impacts patient outcomes such as drug toxicity, financial toxicity, and survival, these outcomes may be
affected when industry payments cause changes in physicians’ treatment selection. Despite concerns about
the potential influence of industry payments on medical practice, no study has investigated whether the
changes in treatment patterns resulting from industry payments have consequences for patients. The short-
term project goal is to evaluate the association between industry payments and cancer care quality, patient
outcomes, and costs. The long-term research goal is to understand the importance of physician-industry
financial relationships within the US healthcare system. Our overall hypothesis is that industry payments affect
care delivery and, ultimately, patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will link CMS Open Payments data
to Medicare fee-for-service claims. The exposure of interest will be receipt of payments by the treating
physician from a manufacturer of a drug relevant to each patient’s treatment decision. Aim 1: Assess the
association between industry payments and cancer care quality. We will assess whether receipt of
industry payments by physicians is associated with the likelihood that they deliver the guideline-preferred
treatment for each patient (1A) and established forms of low-value care (1B). We hypothesize that physicians
who received payments are less likely to use guideline-preferred treatments (1A) and are more likely to use
low-value interventions (1B). Aim 2: Assess the association between industry payments and patient
outcomes and costs of care. We will assess whether patients treated by physicians who received industry
payments have differences in patient-focused outcomes such as unplanned acute care utilization, survival
time, and quality of end-of-life care (2A) and whether they have differences in Medicare spending (2B). We
hypothesize that patients treated by physicians who received payments are more likely to have acute care
utilization, shorter survival time, and lower quality end-of-life care (2A) and to have increased Medicare
spending (2B). This study will be the first to assess the relationship between industry payments and patient-
focused outcomes, substantially increasing our understanding of the health system impact of these payments.
These results may inform future policy and practice decisions regarding physician-industry interactions,
potentially contributing to improvements in cancer care quality, improved patient outcomes, and lower costs."

This is a competing renewal application of our longstanding R01 Grant CA74305 that
concerns the development and application of chemical approaches to enhance the
understanding of cell signaling pathways and the attachment, removal, and function of
protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). In the next cycle, we plan to investigate
how ubiquitination regulates two key cancer-related signaling enzymes, PTEN and Akt,
how several cancer-connected E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases target and catalyze Ub transfer
to their protein substrates, and how mTORC2 phosphorylates its major substrate Akt.
PTEN is one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes and catalyzes the
conversion of phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to PIP2 and in
this way antagonizes the action of the PI3-kinase/Akt oncogenic signaling pathway. Akt
is a protein Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by PIP3 and drives tumor formation. Akt is an
intensively studied cancer therapeutic target. E3 Ub ligases are a large family (>600
members) of enzymes that target Akt, PTEN, and thousands of cellular substrates for
Lys ubiquitination. Our research program will continue to develop and employ protein
semisynthetic methods including ubiquitin hydrazide installation to generate mimics of
mono-ubiquitinated proteins and covalent E3-Ub-substrate ternary complexes. Our three
specific aims are: 1. Elucidate the basis of PTEN and Akt regulation by Lys
ubiquitination; 2. Delineate the catalytic mechanisms and protein substrate recognition of
key E3 ubiquitin ligases; 3. Determine the molecular basis of mTORC2 mediated-
phosphorylation of Akt. With site-specifically modified signaling proteins in hand, we will
integrate kinetic assays, structural analysis, binding measurements, and cell-based
studies to clarify key regulatory and signaling features. Upon completion of this research
effort, we will broaden the knowledge of how Lys ubiquitination targets critical cancer-
related proteins and influences their functions. We will also deepen our understanding
of how the multisubunit mTORC2 complex is able to activate Akt. Moreover, these
studies should pave the way for new therapeutic strategies to combat pathway
dysregulation in cancer. This research program will also enable the training of the next
generation of biochemical investigators with an interest in cancer."
10889179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With support from this program, we reported in 2016 that across multiple rodent models of type 2 diabetes
(T2D), remission of hyperglycemia lasting for weeks or months can be achieved with a single
intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). In the years since, our investigation
into mechanisms underlying this effect has consistently shown that in addition to sustained glucose lowering,
FGF1 also induces a potent but transient anorexic response. In a primate model, this effect is sufficiently
intense as to suspend ongoing efforts to translate FGF1-based diabetes therapy to the clinic.
 Studies in this proposal will clarify mechanisms underlying both the anorexic response and sustained
glucose lowering induced by the central action of FGF1, with a focus on neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate
nucleus (ARC) that express agouti-related peptide (AgRP neurons). Inhibition of these neurons by FGF1 is
implicated in both the feeding and glucose-lowering effects of FGF1, although distinct projections and signaling
molecules appear to mediate these divergent effects. Thus, whereas diabetes remission induced by icv FGF1
injection is blocked by Mc4r deletion or blockade, these interventions have no impact on FGF1-induced
anorexia. Instead, we hypothesize that the anorexic response involves activation of neurons in the parabrachial
nucleus that express calcitonin gene-related peptide (PBNCGRP neurons) via a melanocortin-independent
mechanism. These neurons are 1) highly anorexigenic, 2) tonically inhibited by GABAergic projections from
AgRP neurons, and 3) robustly activated following icv FGF1 injection. SA1 investigates the hypothesis that
FGF1-induced anorexia results from PBNCGRP neuron activation secondary to reduced GABAergic input
from AgRP neurons. We will also determine if FGF1-induced PBNCGRP neuron activation can be blocked
by pharmacological intervention with a GABA receptor agonist, while having no effect on the
associated remission of hyperglycemia.
 A second goal of this proposal is to delineate the mechanism(s) underlying prolonged inhibition of AgRP
neurons by FGF1. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix specializations that enmesh most AgRP
neurons, and loss of these PNNs is hypothesized to contribute to diabetes-associated AgRP neuron activation.
Since these PNNs are rapidly reformed following icv FGF1 injection, SA 2 tests the hypothesis that
sustained inhibition of AgRP neurons by FGF1 requires reassembly of the PNNs that enmesh them.

10889183,"This is a new application for an R01 award for epidemiologist Dr. Julia Simard, at Stanford 
University School of Medicine, who brings an innovative lens to the field as an early stage 
investigator building a research program focused on adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients 
with systemic lupus erythematosus. For her K01 award, Dr. Simard and colleagues showed that 
pregnant women with lupus are a highly-medicated group, who experience more adverse 
outcomes, including early-onset preeclampsia, preterm delivery, infection, and stroke. In recent 
pilot work, Dr. Simard found that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is used to manage lupus 
during pregnancy, may prevent preeclampsia and preterm delivery. In two populations (one US 
and one in Sweden), Dr. Simard also found that fewer than half of pregnant women with lupus 
use HCQ, despite recommendations. This has been corroborated by others as well. 
Dr. Simard builds upon this work in the present application via three large international 
populations to determine whether HCQ reduces the risk of these adverse outcomes in lupus 
pregnancies. Dr. Simard will partner with colleagues in Sweden, Israel, and Kaiser Permanente 
of Northern California’s Division of Research in the United States. These data include details on 
ordered and filled prescriptions, and often unavailable data on antiphospholipid antibody status 
and parity, two critical factors in lupus reproductive research. In aim 1, Dr. Simard will determine 
whether preeclampsia risk is reduced in women who use HCQ during pregnancy. In aim 2, Dr. 
Simard will examine preterm delivery, partitioning spontaneous from medically-indicated, to 
examine overall risks and medication by preeclampsia and other factors such as glucocorticoid 
use and gestational diabetes. 
In aim 3, Dr. Simard’s team will identify barriers and facilitators of HCQ use in pregnant women 
with lupus using an innovative mixed methods design. After evaluating patient adherence and 
guideline adherence by clinicians in the large US and Israeli databases, they will identify 
subsets less likely to adhere and examine how they differ from adherent patients. Then 
partnering with patients and providers, they will use these quantitative findings to identify 
barriers and facilitators of adherence from the patient and provider perspectives using focus 
groups. This aim will provide key information on HCQ use and prescription practices to improve 
the analytic paradigm and inform our clinical understanding HCQ use in lupus pregnancy, and 
provide foundational support for clinical care and possibly, a future clinical trial."
10889185,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traditional epidemiologic measures of pregnancy intention are fraught with psychometric and conceptual
limitations. Measures focused on whether pregnancy was intended or optimally timed omit emotional aspects
of pregnancy, do not account for fluctuating or uncertain intentions, and may neglect the reproductive
experiences of significant segments of the US population for whom pregnancy planning may not be salient or
feasible, including socially and economically marginalized populations. Furthermore, there is emerging
evidence that the associations between pre-conception intentions and reproductive health outcomes may be
relatively weak. Extensive qualitative work suggests that women’s responses to existing pregnancies within the
complex contexts of their lives may drive pregnancy-related decisions and reproductive outcomes more than
pre-conception intentions. New measures are needed to more fully assess the cognitive, affective and
circumstantial factors that influence orientations toward, or “acceptability” of, existing pregnancies and affect
downstream outcomes associated with these pregnancies. In this proposal, we aim to develop a
multidimensional, quantitative measure of post-conception pregnancy acceptability (the Post-CAP). Our
specific aims are to: 1) create a comprehensive conceptual framework of post-conception pregnancy
acceptability via in-depth interviews with diverse women of reproductive age; 2) generate quantitative items
based on Aim 1 qualitative findings and existing measures, with subsequent refinement and evaluation using
Delphi methods with lay and academic experts and cognitive interviews; 3) test the Post-CAP in a large,
longitudinal cohort of women seeking abortion or prenatal care, to assess psychometric properties including
factor structure, reliability and validity. Completion of these aims will produce a novel, psychometrically sound
measure which will facilitate a critical expansion of our understanding of associations between pre-conception
intentions, post-conception orientations, and reproductive health outcomes."
10889035,"The senses of hearing and balance are mediated by the cochlea and vestibular organs of the inner ear. In
these organs, mechanical motion (generated either by sound vibrations or by head movements) is detected by
sensory hair cells and transmitted to the brain by the auditory and vestibular nerves. Hair cells are essential for
sensory function, but can be injured by noise exposure, ototoxicity or infections, and are also lost as a
consequence of normal aging. After injury, the timely removal of cellular debris from the sensory epithelium
helps promote repair and homeostasis. This process is mediated by two distinct cell types: (1) Supporting cells,
which can engulf cellular debris and – in nonmammalian vertebrates – generate replacement hair cells, and (2)
Macrophages, which are effector cells of the innate immune system that also recognize and engulf dying cells.
Supporting cells are present in all hair cell-containing epithelia. The tissues of the inner ear also contain
resident populations of macrophages, and macrophage-mediated inflammation occurs after most types of otic
injury. When responding to hair cell injury, it is critical that both supporting cells and macrophages correctly
distinguish between healthy and dying cells, and then target and remove only those cells that are irreversibly
damaged. A key objective of this project is to understand how this process occurs. One set of experiments will
examine a signaling pathway known to be essential for evoking phagocytic responses in macrophages and
other cell types, but has not been previously studied in the inner ear. In addition, we will determine whether
inhibiting phagocytosis after acute injury may permit some damaged hair cells to survive, and whether the
engulfment of injured hair cells is an important trigger for sensory regeneration. Studies will employ both
mammalian and zebrafish models, in order to best utilize the unique advantages of both systems. A second set
of experiments will enhance our very limited knowledge of the role of inflammation in the vestibular organs.
Projects will focus on two clinically relevant situations. First, it is known that prenatal infection with
cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause developmental deficits in both hearing and balance, but the underlying
mechanisms are completely unknown. Using a validated mouse model, we have shown that CMV infection
leads to a massive inflammatory response in the vestibular maculae, which is accompanied by phagocytosis of
sensory cells. We will determine whether this inflammation is the cause of CMV-induced pathology and also
whether macrophages transport CMV into the vestibular periphery. Additional studies will characterize
vestibular injury and inflammation in a mouse model of cochlear implantation. Completion of the studies will
greatly enhance current knowledge of the cellular signals that regulate inflammation in the inner ear. Such
knowledge will permit development of methods for modulating such inflammation, so as to reduce pathology
and enhance functional recovery after injury."
10889083,"Project Summary
The perception of emotion starts with emotion detection, which reflects an ability to determine whether
emotional content is present. The detection of emotional information is evolutionarily relevant, in that it allows
for a rapid behavioral response when faced with threat. Emotion detection (and its relation to immediate threat)
has primarily been studied with adults and very little is known about the development of this critical ability. The
K99 portion of this proposal seeks to remedy the situation by testing infants for detection of emotional content
in very brief stimulus presentations (50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 400ms). The infants will be tested using happy,
angry, and fearful facial expressions and saccade latencies to different emotions will establish whether they
are differentially detected; specifically, if threat-related emotions (i.e., anger, fear) are detected faster than non-
threatening emotion (happiness). Additionally, eye-tracking and pupillometry measures will determine whether
infants are utilizing specific features to detect distinct emotions and whether pupil diameter, an index of
autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, is altered by emotional faces. Most importantly, the R00 phase of
this award will be used to study a longitudinal sample to assess individual differences in detection speed
across development and determine whether these relate to later developmental abilities. Candidate: The
candidate has her Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology and has 2 years of postdoctoral research experience.
She has a strong publication record despite a 4-year absence from her field due to health issues. With this
award, she will reach her potential to become a successful independent investigator. Training: Specific
training in the acquisition and analyses of eye-tracking data and the related measures of pupillometry will be
useful in her pursuit of a tenure-track position at a Research I/Doctorate Extensive university. Becoming
comfortable using MATLAB and conducting analyses using advanced statistical methods will be appropriate
training aims to facilitate this goal. KU’s Life Span Institute is an interdisciplinary research center focused on
development across the life span, and its collaborative environment will provide an ideal setting for the
proposed research. Research: Using a cross-sectional study with 3.5- and 7.5-month-old infants, the proposed
research will document the time course of emotion detection, potential preferential processing of threat-related
emotions, how low-level visual features influence detection, and how ANS activity is differentially modulated by
emotional content. The R00 phase will add an additional visit at 12.5 months and a follow-up assessment at 18
months. This study will establish cross-age stability across measures and examine their predictive validity for
developmental outcomes. Documenting the development of this vital skill in early infancy has potential
implications in the study of typical and atypical development, such as that in autism spectrum disorder."
10889132,"ABSTRACT
In this Predoctoral Fellowship proposal, I will be trained for a future as a physician-scientist with my own
independent research program at the interface of genomics, computational biology, and neuroscience.
During my MD/PhD training, I will be co-mentored by two physician-scientists, Drs. John Greally (Medical
Genomics) and Pablo Castillo (Neurology), addressing a question that is timely with the imminent widespread
use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in clinical diagnostics – how do we interpret variants in the non-
coding majority of the human genome when a patient presents with a medical problem?
I will focus on autism, as a condition that represents a substantial proportion of patients seen by medical
genetics services, for which there is extensive WGS information from thousands of families. Despite this wealth
of research sequencing, only a small minority of individuals with autism receive a positive outcome of
diagnostic exome or WGS. I propose that the currently limited diagnostic success rates are mostly due to our
inability to interpret pathogenic variants in the non-coding majority of the genome of these patients. By
improving our insights into non-coding variants, we will be able to offer diagnostic information to many more
families seeking answers than currently.
My strategy is to focus on de novo variants (DNVs) in offspring with autism born to unaffected parents. My
hypothesis is that DNVs can be pathogenic when they occur in the cis-regulatory regions of cell types
mediating autism. The project is therefore based on a computational genomics foundation, using WGS and
DNV calls from large datasets from thousands of families who have a member with autism. In my preliminary
data, I show that DNVs in individuals with autism are enriched at cis-regulatory loci in glial and neuronal cells in
particular, and at genes known to be causative for autism. In my project, I will test these associations more
rigorously, and will define a high-confidence set of DNVs for functional testing.
Two types of functional testing will be performed. One will test whether the DNVs alter molecular genomic
properties, including chromatin accessibility and gene expression. The second will test the physiological
properties of the cells. To generate the appropriate cells for testing, I plan to use induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) that are in vitro differentiated to GABAergic neurons and astrocytes. By performing CRISPR-mediated
genomic editing in the iPSCs, I can generate cells with the candidate pathogenic DNVs, and test whether they
have effects on cellular properties like dendritogenesis, synaptogenesis, and electrophysiology, increasing the
confidence that these DNVs have pathogenic effects.
I will have the privilege of getting training in sophisticated computational, stem cell and neuroscience
techniques, under the guidance of two leaders in their fields, as part of a comprehensive training plan that will
equip me to become the independent physician-scientist I aspire to be in my career."
10889217,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Brain atrophy is a common correlate of dementia. Majority of older persons with dementia have comorbid
cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. The spectrum of SVD includes
both small vessel pathologies and diverse tissue injuries. Differing biologic processes may contribute towards
the etiology of brain atrophy in vulnerable brain regions, including the hippocampus, a structural brain change
seen on MRI proximate to cognitive decline. The interplay between SVD and AD is complex, with evidence to
suggest microglia inflammation may be important. To date, very little research has focused on the interplay
between SVD, AD, and microglia inflammation in the context of regional brain volume. The objective of this study
is to examine the association of neuropathologic and MRI SVD markers with regional brain volumes and identify
the effects of comorbid AD pathology and microglia inflammation. This K01 will integrate neuropathology,
neuroimaging, and cognitive data from three community-based studies, the Religious Orders Study, the Memory
and Aging Project, and Minority Aging and Research Study. Specifically, this proposal will use state-of-the-art
methods to capture novel digital morphometric changes from post-mortem brain tissue, use MRI-defined
quantitative volume measures in susceptible brain regions, examine differing SVD markers with regional brain
volumes, examine in-vivo longitudinal SVD changes, and extend analyses in African Americans. Primary aims
are 1) Examine the relationship between SVD markers, AD pathology, and regional brain volume, 2) Determine
the role of microglia inflammation with SVD markers and regional brain volume, and 3) Identify associations
between SVD markers, regional brain volume, and cognitive decline. An exploratory aim 4) will examine the
relationship between SVD markers and regional brain volume in African Americans. My mentorship team has
extensive experience with large epidemiological studies of aging and dementia and will provide expert guidance
through the research methods and complimentary training plan. Specific areas of mentorship expertise include
translational neuropathology, neuroimaging, biostatistics, health disparities, and cognition . Their expertise will
be augmented by the interdisciplinary training programat Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC), and cutting-
edge resources within the RADC Cores (Neuropathology, Neuroimaging and Biomarker, and Biostatistics).
Together, the proposed research and training plan provides the framework from which I can launch a successful
independent research career."
10907845,"Project Summary/Abstract
The objective of this K99/R00 proposal is to estimate the effect of community water fluoridation on adverse
birth outcomes in California and identify whether there are subpopulations who are especially vulnerable to
fluoride exposure during pregnancy. Fluoride has been added to water supplies to promote dental health in the
United States since 1945, but the impacts on pregnancy outcomes have never been assessed.
It is possible that maternal and in-utero fetal exposure to fluoride increases risk of preterm birth and small-for-
gestational age. A small number of studies in other countries suggest there is an increased risk of adverse
birth outcomes associated with drinking water with naturally high levels of fluoride, and evidence suggests
fluoride consumption can affect thyroid function and cardiovascular systems, both of which play important roles
in regulating and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Since 1995, California has required water systems with at
least 10,000 service connections to fluoridate their water, but systems were only required to implement a
fluoridation program once the funds were allocated. Therefore, there is a substantial amount of variability in
which water systems have added fluoride over the last 25 years, and when they did so.
We will leverage this variation in water fluoridation practices in California to (1) identify the effects of changes
in water fluoridation on adverse birth outcomes during 2006-2017 and (2) evaluate whether there are
heterogeneous exposure effects by maternal/fetal characteristics and environmental co-exposures.
Furthermore, we will use the ECHO.CA.IL pregnancy cohort, which is composed of pregnant women and their
children in San Francisco and Illinois, to (3a) assess whether maternal urinary fluoride during the second
trimester is associated with reduced gestational age or lower birthweight-for-gestational-age-z-scores at birth
and (3b) evaluate whether there are heterogeneous effects of exposure by maternal/fetal characteristics and
environmental co-exposures.
The research plan is bolstered by an exceptional mentorship team and training plan at the University of San
Francisco, California. The proposed project builds on the applicant’s background in perinatal epidemiology and
provides training in new statistical methods to identify heterogeneous exposure effects and education in the
biological processes of gestation and parturition, exposure assessment of environmental chemicals, and
translating scientific findings to policymakers. The combined research and training plans will enable the
candidate to transition into an independent researcher of policy-relevant social and environmental factors that
shape perinatal health.
This research aligns with NIEHS’s strategic goals to evaluate health effects of the exposome, identify individual
susceptibilities to environmental hazards, utilize data science techniques, and generate evidence that can be
utilized by policymakers to improve population health."
10889137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The 5-year survival is the lowest for cancers of the pancreas (<10%) among all cancers and the incidence of
pancreatic cancer continues to increase. The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), followed by pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). Pancreatic cancer is usually
deadly due to metastatic dissemination and insufficient therapeutics. Factors driving metastasis of pancreatic
cancer remains largely unclear. There is an urgent need to understand the biology of pancreatic cancer
metastasis and develop new therapeutic strategies.
We were the first to report that Receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility isoform B (RHAMMB), but not the full
length RHAMMA, promotes metastasis of PNET. We found that among different splice isoforms, RHAMMB was
significantly upregulated in human PDAC, and that higher RHAMMB predicted poorer survival of PDAC.
However, whether RHAMMB promotes PDAC metastasis is still unknown and will be determined in this
proposal work. Our preliminary data showed that RHAMMB overexpression induced RhoA signaling, migration,
3D spheroid invasion, and lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis in both PDAC and PNET cell lines, while RHAMMB
knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of RhoA signaling caused opposite effects. We hypothesis that
RHAMMB promotes pancreatic cancer metastasis through RhoA signaling/LD biogenesis and this RHAMMB
/RhoA/LD axis represents a novel therapeutic target.
To test this hypothesis, we will use multiple experimental systems, including cell lines, orthotopic tumor
xenograft, genetically engineered mouse models, and patient-derived xenografts. The findings will be cross-
examined. The success of this proposed study will establish the mechanisms by which RHAMMB promotes
pancreatic cancer metastasis and translated into new therapeutic approaches for treatment of this devastating
cancer."
10889145,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Gene therapy (GT) for the hemophilias is poised to fulfill the promise of a safe, affordable,
lifelong correction following a single treatment. Yet clinical trials employing AAV vectors to treat adult hemophilia
A (HA) patients have underscored the risk of hepatoxicity and genotoxicity in adult patients receiving GT. In
addition, the use of AAV-based GT is prevented by pre-existing AAV immunity in a high percentage of patients.
While FVIII inhibitors have not yet been seen in GT trials, inhibitors usually appear within the first 50 exposure
days to FVIII, and since all enrolled patients were selected based upon an inhibitor-free clinical history, it is likely
that the patients were not “inhibitor-prone”, leaving unanswered the critical question of whether GT will avoid
inhibitor induction. GT to treat HA at birth provides the advantage of correcting bleeding events sooner, but
whether neonatal GT would avoid FVIII inhibitor induction and hepatic inflammation is, at present, unknown.
Recent studies have shown a 59% incidence of neutralizing antibodies to AAV at birth. Thus, treatment during
the neonatal period will likely be hampered by anti-AAV immunity. One approach that could circumvent both
AAV- and FVIII-related immune hurdles while enabling correction prior to disease onset is in utero GT (IUGT).
Using the same preclinical animal model (sheep) used to delineate conditions to cure SCID patients prenatally,
we showed that the highly proliferative state and relative immune-immaturity of the fetus can be exploited to
achieve clinically relevant levels of gene transfer to multiple tissues and induce durable tolerance to vector-
encoded proteins. Besides its inherent advantages as a GT recipient, its rapid cellular turnover makes the fetus
a highly sensitive system in which to define the potential genotoxicity and risk of tumorigenesis following AAV
GT. This rapid cellular proliferation also provides a rigorous testbed to define the incidence and locations of AAV
genomic integration, determine the duration of AAV persistence, and identify the optimal target cell(s) within the
liver to achieve long-term expression of a fVIII transgene and resultant therapeutic benefit. The overall goal of
this proposal is to use fetal sheep to address critical unanswered biological and safety questions that plague
liver-targeted AAV-based GT for HA and test the hypothesis that performing AAV-based IUGT will overcome
the immune hurdles inherent to postnatal GT, transduce sufficient numbers of the appropriate hepatic cells to
mediate long-term therapeutic plasma FVIII levels, and induce durable tolerance to FVIII. We propose 3 Aims: i)
Define the in vivo tissue tropism of two AAV serotypes in use in clinical trials for HA (AAV5 and AAV3B) following
administration into fetal and neonatal recipients; ii) Define the impact of fVIII-encoding AAV transduction on fetal
vs. neonatal liver function; and iii) Determine the duration of fVIII-AAV persistence and fVIII transgene
expression, and whether durable immune tolerance is induced to FVIII and/or AAV following in utero vs. neonatal
GT. We hope that these studies will elucidate whether IUGT or neonatal GT for HA will be safe, and whether or
not the therapy will be long-lasting, prevent breakthrough bleeds, and avoid FVIII immune responses."
10889000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual minority and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience a wide variety of health disparities
compared to their non-SGM peers. These disparities include higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) risk factors tied to psychological distress (e.g., depression, stress), behavioral CVD risk factors
(smoking, physical inactivity, diet), and clinical CVD risk factors (e.g., diabetes, obesity, hypertension, high
cholesterol). Existing SGM population health studies rely primarily on self-reported measures to document
CVD risk factors and disease prevalence, thus ignoring undiagnosed clinical CVD risk factors present among
younger populations. Though these studies have laid important groundwork to document the existence of SGM
CVD disparities, the absence of objective measures of CVD risk factors and outcomes therefore remains a
critical gap in the SGM health literature. Minority stress theory (MST) is the leading framework proposed to
explain the wide-ranging health disparities observed among marginalized populations. In MST models,
structural stigma (e.g., anti-SGM laws) is viewed as leading to and exacerbating distal (discrimination) and
proximal stressors (internalized stigma, perceived stigma). These stigma-related stressors can contribute to
poor SGM health via enhanced psychosocial distress and CVD risk behaviors. These pathways add to the
higher chronic stress burden associated with the development of clinical CVD risk factors. Increasingly, MST-
derived frameworks also reflect that resilience promoting factors at multiple levels (e.g., identity affirmation,
social support) can decrease the harmful population health effects of stigma. Applying a theoretically-driven
intersectional lens, we propose to build on studies describing the existence of SGM CVD disparities by
contextualizing these disparities across person, place, and time in relation to social power systems. We
propose an ancillary study to CARDIA to collect sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data as well as
measures of SGM stigma and resilience promoting factors in the Year 35 CARDIA exam. Through an
innovative collaboration, we also propose to pool CARDIA data with data from the Hispanic Community Health
Study/Study on Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort to address the following compelling and timely Specific Aims: Aim
1: Assess how behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors vary by SGM status over the life course. Aim 2: Among
SGM participants (n=734), investigate how stigma and resilience promoting factors at the internalized and
interpersonal levels associated with behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors. Aim 3: Determine the influence of
SGM structural stigma on behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors. Overall, the impact of these studies will be
to advance CVD epidemiology and to enhance the evidence base to ameliorate SGM CVD health disparities
and promote SGM CVD health equity at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities."
10889105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, one out of eight people suffers from hearing loss. Common causes of hearing loss are age, frequent
exposure to loud noise, genetic disorders, and more. Hearing loss is often accompanied by other medical
conditions such as higher rate of depression, social isolation, and cognitive decline (e.g., dementia). Many
diverse and novel therapeutic methods are developed to treat hearing loss, but one common challenge that they
all share is how to safely deliver therapeutics to the inner ear. Often, non-invasive methods to deliver drugs to
the inner ear cannot penetrate the inner ear’s barriers, and consequently, only a small fraction of the drug
reaches its target. Alternatively, invasive surgical methods such as direct injection to the inner ear could
potentially cause damage to the cells that populate the inner ear.
Although rodent models vastly expanded our understanding of hearing loss and its treatment at a molecular
level, rodent models are less suitable to address the drug delivery problem. This is due to the fact that the size
of the rodent’s inner ear, and the thickness of its protective barriers do not match the human’s, therefore,
evaluation of the translational potential of new drug delivery methods using rodent models is challenging.
To address this gap, we would like to advocate for the use of the pig as a translational animal model to study
non-invasive drug delivery strategies to the inner ear. Pigs are large animal models, and their size, anatomy,
intelligence, and genetics are by far closer to humans than rodents. Consequently, the pig is becoming a popular
animal model and it is commonly used in cardiovascular research, wound healing, organ transplantation,
nutritional studies, and more. In general, pigs are readily available for research as they are a popular form of
livestock, and in the US alone, over 100 million pigs are slaughtered annually.
Here, to establish the pig as a large animal model to study local delivery to the inner ear, we will: (i) Validate an
ex-vivo porcine RWM model for drug permeability studies. (ii) Develop a method to deliver therapeutics to the
middle and inner ear of the porcine model. Technically, we will utilize tissue clearing and labeling techniques
together with advanced microscopy to image the whole porcine inner ear with cellular resolution. This
methodology facilitates the biodistribution of drugs in the tissue.
Overall, the success of these goals will open future avenues for testing minimally invasive drug delivery methods
to the inner ear and studying in-vivo drug delivery in a big animal model."
10889106,"This project aims to identify the targets and features of antibody responses that determine the outcome of malaria
infection in young African children. It uses Systems Serology, combining multi-dimensional antibody profiling
with machine learning, to study responses to Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1),
the dominant antigen on the surface of malaria infected erythrocytes (IEs). We also study key merozoite antigens,
which are implicated in protection from asymptomatic parasitemia (AP) or uncomplicated malaria (UM).
Responses include antibody subclass, isotype, and Fc receptor and complement engagement, together with
antibody glycosylation and avidity. Some PfEMP1 types are implicated in cerebral malaria (CM); others may
influence outcomes across a spectrum which includes AP, clearance of parasites and progression to UM. Our
earlier work validates this approach. We applied Systems Serology to pregnancy malaria and were able to
identify seven key responses to the PfEMP1 that mediates placental malaria (VAR2CSA), that distinguished
women susceptible to placental malaria from protected women. Four of these seven were IE based assays.
The proposed study is based in Blantyre, Malawi, an International Center of Excellence in Malaria Research
(ICEMR) site. In ongoing studies, children with CM have retinal exams and MRI scans to assess neurovascular
involvement and brain swelling, respectively. Cohorts of controls with UM and community controls with AP are
enrolled and sustained. In Aim 1, we use Luminex technology on acute and convalescent plasma and parasite
isolates to characterize antibody response to a broad range of PfEMP1 protein fragments implicated in severe
malaria. From these analyses we will identify antibody responses to PfEMP1 domains that are lacking in children
with CM, that differ between children with or without retinopathy and brain swelling, and that develop in
convalescence from CM.
In Aim 2, priority PfEMP1s identified in Aim 1 are studied in depth using cell-based assays of phagocytosis,
respiratory burst and activation with both PfEMP1 fragments and parasite lines expressing similar PfEMP1 types.
We have established assays using monocytes, neutrophils, NK cells and whole blood for this purpose.
Aim 3 uses community cohorts recruited by the Malawi ICEMR, including children with AP, to study how
antibodies to PfEMP1 and to merozoite antigens influence the evolution of AP, to identify antibody responses
that prevent progression to UM or lead to clearance of infection. These comprehensive, integrated studies will
compare and contrast antibody responses that protect against CM, against UM, and that clear parasitemia.
Identifying the targets and properties of antibodies to PfEMP1 that are associated with protection from life
threatening malaria in African children will be key to developing tailored vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or
treat severe malaria. Discovering key protective antibody responses across the malaria infection spectrum will
reveal the importance of antibody to PfEMP1 and merozoites for malaria control and elimination."

 The goal of this project is to develop effective bioremediation technologies for metal
mixtures occurring in contaminated waters and soils in sites impacted by mining legacy that are
used for agriculture and grazing in Navajo Nation and Laguna Pueblo. The burden of mining
activities has affected various Superfund sites in the U.S., causing multigenerational metal
exposures in our partner communities. The negative health impacts of human exposure to
Uranium, Arsenic, Vanadium and other co-occurring metals are well documented. The chemical
reactions influencing the solubility of metal mixtures in environmental systems remain unclear.
Our collective expertise will integrate advances in will integrate advances in ecology, mycology,
molecular biology, and environmental engineering. We will develop novel bioreactors catalyzed
by plant-fungal symbiosis coupled with adsorption and precipitation using natural minerals for
sustainable bioremediation of metal mixtures.
 The following specific aims are proposed: 1. Identify mechanisms underlying the interaction
between plants and fungi in water that mediate the adsorption and precipitation of metal
mixtures; and 2. Manipulate bioreactors in pots containing plants and fungi in soils with natural
minerals under environmentally relevant water chemistries for remediation of metal mixtures.
The proposed research will provide new insights about the reactivity of metal mixtures mediated
by fungi and plants. Collaborations with Navajo Nation and Laguna Pueblo will serve to ensure
that the science generated is responsive to community needs. Additionally, this project seeks to
engage graduate students from under-represented minority groups, in this way contributing to
training the next generation of scientists and engineers. The knowledge resulting from the
proposed project is essential to risk assessment and to the advancement of bioremediation risk
reduction strategies for metal mixtures."

COVID-19 vaccines have been inequitably distributed and vaccine uptake has lagged, particularly for
immigrant, refugee, Latino, and Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) communities. Underlying reasons
for the slow and variable uptake of COVID-19 vaccines include individual (e.g., health literacy, trust), cultural
(e.g., linguistic needs), and structural barriers, such as technological and systemic factors (e.g., complex and
onerous processes to schedule and attend vaccine appointments). There is no one-size-fits-all approach to
vaccine implementation. This is borne out in the data indicating enormous disparities in COVID-19 testing,
morbidity, mortality, and inoculation rates. Culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate, dynamic, and
scalable strategies are essential to the immediate and long-term success of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and
pandemic mitigation. Changing COVID-19 vaccine uptake behaviors offers an opportunity to concurrently
improve engagement in other preventive health behaviors that are important public health priorities (e.g.,
diabetes management, cancer screenings, recommended adult vaccinations). We propose to co-refine, test,
and scale a multicomponent health program to address the multi-level barriers to vaccine uptake and
engagement in preventative healthcare in immigrant, refugee, Latino, and BIPOC communities in San Diego.
Harnessing reverse innovation thinking, we will apply the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability
Model (PRISM) to co-create with our community partners, the Global ARC, and San Ysidro Health, the
elements of a health program that combines mHealth outreach (community-driven text and voice messages)
and enhanced care coordination. Responsive to NOSI NOT-MD-22-006, this R01 will build on our current
CEAL and RADx-UP implementation research to scale and sustain a multicomponent health program to
increase acceptance, access, and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and preventive care engagement among
underserved communities. We assembled an experienced team of community-engaged implementation
scientists, health equity, public health, and infectious disease researchers to accomplish the following aims: 1)
Optimize a multicomponent health program to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake and engagement in
preventive healthcare using our established co-creation approach to address multi-level (individual,
community, systemic) barriers to vaccine uptake and preventive care engagement; 2) Evaluate the
implementation, effectiveness, and sustainment of the multicomponent COVID-19 vaccine and preventive care
engagement program using a hybrid type 3 implementation-effectiveness sequential multiple assignment
randomized trial design across immigrant, refugee, Latino, and BIPOC communities in Central and East San
Diego."
10915695,"Project Summary
Teen drivers are three times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than adult drivers. Several factors
contribute to increased crash risk among novice teen drivers, including distracted driving, inexperience,
heightened risk taking, and an underdeveloped ability to identify potential roadway hazards. Potential hazards
refer to emerging threats on or near the roadway (e.g., the car in front of you braking suddenly due to a
pedestrian darting into traffic) which may or may not evolve into an actual hazard or crash. Experienced drivers
quickly identify and respond to potential hazards with little to no effortful cognition. Novice drivers need
repeated experience in the perception of hazards to effectively identify and respond to potential hazards, yet
fail to develop this skill during the learner phase of licensure. We hypothesize that this experience can be
hastened with specific parental guidance. As primary supervisors and teachers during the learner phase of
licensure, parents are well positioned to teach their children to identify latent hazards in the driving
environment. However, research on driving supervision indicates this type of instruction is almost completely
absent. The overall goal of the current project is to improve parental instruction and practice surrounding these
events. The first aim of this proposal is to describe parent-teen conversations about hazard identification and
mitigation while parents and teens jointly engage in a perceptual/adaptive learning module – a hazard
anticipation training program delivered via video. We hypothesize that parents will vary in how they scaffold
teens’ ability to correctly identify and perceive hazards according to individual differences in teen temperament,
parenting style, and family communication pattern. The second aim seeks to develop a hazard anticipation
training program to teach parents to better communicate with their children about identifying potential hazards
on the roadway. To this end we will modify an existing training program, designed to help drivers anticipate
hazards on the roadway, to help improve parents’ communication related to these events. For the third and
final aim, we will test the impact of the intervention in a state-of-the-art driving simulator, the NADS-1. We
hypothesize that compared to controls, parents exposed to the intervention will show improved high-order
driving instruction - applicable to the current and future driving environment. We also hypothesize that teens of
parents exposed to the intervention the will look to and respond to potential hazards on the roadway more
quickly and reliably than those assigned to the control. My graduate training in parent-child communication, my
MPH which trained me in population-level primary prevention, and my postdoctoral fellowship in simulation
research have prepared me to begin this interdisciplinary research. This K99/R01 award will equip me with the
necessary training and skills in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation to achieve the aims
set forth in this proposal. Additionally, this proposal directly addresses goals set forth by the NICHD strategic
plan by assessing and preventing the leading cause of traumatic injury in teens, motor-vehicle crashes."

This proposal is responsive to NIA solicitation PAR-22-094/NOT-AG-21-036 for projects involving the
development of novel approaches to diagnose and study Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)
with an emphasis on the need for biomarkers for dementia types other than Alzheimer’s disease in the ADRD
spectrum, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this project, we will leverage our MPI team’s expertise
with MR-based accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation (TNS) and PET super-resolution (SR) to develop
thalamic-nuclei-based measures of atrophy, connectivity, and hypometabolism as possible FTD biomarker
candidates. FTD, the second most common cause of dementia in adults under 65 years of age after AD, is
clinically, genetically, and pathologically heterogeneous. There is an urgent need for antemortem biomarkers for
FTD that are sensitive across its different subtypes. Thalamic atrophy is a common feature of early disease
pathogenesis for all FTD subtypes. We propose to develop an integrated MR and PET imaging framework for
deriving quantitative imaging measures from the thalamic nuclei and validate in secondary-use multimodal
imaging data. Our dataset will include both sporadic FTD and familial C9orf72+ FTD patients. We will use a more
advanced variant of our TNS approach which, as per our preliminary results from an Alzheimer’s disease cohort,
leads to significantly better discrimination between healthy and impaired groups than FreeSurfer’s Bayesian
segmentation method, which is one of the current state-of-the-art TNS methods. We will develop and validate
an SR PET platform that uses MR-based thalamic nuclei labels as additional inputs to the model to enhance
thalamic nuclei contrast. To assess the clinical utility of the thalamic-nuclei-derived multimodal biomarker set for
atrophy, connectivity, and hypometabolism, we will compute receiver operating characteristic curves for FTD
subtype groups vs. cognitively normal subjects. We will also characterize our multimodal biomarker by
establishing a temporal ordering via event-based modeling. To assess the sensitivity of our nuclei-derived
atrophy and connectivity biomarkers, we will conduct cross-sectional spatiotemporal analyses in a larger cohort
with MR-only data that can reveal the age of divergence of each biomarker in a diseased vs. control group.
Finally, we will conduct longitudinal analyses to predict changes in clinical dementia rating and its behavioral and
language subscores from changes in atrophy and connectivity measures from the thalamic nuclei. Unlike
Alzheimer’s disease, for which the ATN research framework is well-developed for biomarker-based
characterization of dementia, there is a pressing need for imaging biomarkers for FTD, which this project can
address. We therefore envision that our proposed research will have high clinical impact on FTD characterization
and could play a role in FTD drug development efforts."
10887086,"Obesity is a metabolic disorder of pandemic incidence in developing countries and the United States. The
development of new therapeutic interventions to help mitigate this disease is a significant need in the clinic and
for public health. Gaining insight into the role of specific brain areas in eating behavior will lead to the discovery
of treatable targets for which drugs can be developed to support metabolic disorder treatments. In support of
this proposal, we present new data showing that central and peripheral administration of a specific inward
rectifier potassium channel Kir7.1 blocker, ML418, produces a robust anorexigenic effect. These results reveal
a new target in the satiety pathway that has not been previously studied. The current application is centered on
the hypothesis that Kir7.1 regulates the sensitivity setpoint of the hypothalamic nuclei involved in energy
hemostasis. We propose to employ a TRAP (targeted recombination in active populations) approach for
accessing and controlling target-sensitive neural circuitry that becomes active after the pharmacological
inhibition of Kir7.1 with ML418. The first aim will identify the Kir7.1 responsive neurons, and it will validate the
participation of these neurons in determining feeding behaviors by challenging the activated centers with a
chemogenetic approach. In the second aim, we will identify hypothalamic circuitry associated with Kir7.1-
activated neurons that regulate energy homeostasis. This proposal presents Kir7.1 as a novel regulator of
energy homeostasis and a potential target for developing novel therapeutic approaches against obesity. More
generally, this work will establish a fundamental platform for basic and clinical research to treat obesity and
eating disorders."
10887169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Peripheral insulin administration and impaired insulin clearance lead to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance
in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). As independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD),
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance contribute to the high burden of CVD experienced by this population.
The long-term goal is to develop approaches to reduce the excess risk of CVD in T1D. As the next step toward
this goal, the overall objective of this proposal is to quantify the ability of combination adjunct-to-insulin therapy
to reduce hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in T1D. The central hypothesis is that combination adjunctive
therapy will (1) mitigate peripheral hyperinsulinemia via decreased insulin dosing and increased insulin
clearance and (2) improve insulin resistance in muscle, adipose, and liver tissues. The rationale for this work is
that gaining insight into the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance will inform new
treatment strategies to mitigate the risk of CVD in T1D. The central hypothesis will be tested in a double-blind,
placebo-controlled, crossover study in which participants with T1D will receive combination adjunct-to-insulin
therapy and double placebo treatment, in random-order. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1)
Quantify the reduction in hyperinsulinemia induced by combination adjunctive therapy and (2) Quantify the
effect of reducing hyperinsulinemia on tissue-specific insulin resistance. For the first aim, ambulatory insulin
dosing and circulating insulin concentrations will be measured, and the metabolic clearance rate of insulin will
be calculated to determine the relative contribution of insulin dosing and insulin clearance in reducing
hyperinsulinemia. For the second aim, insulin sensitivity will be measured in adipose, hepatic, and skeletal
muscle tissue using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with stable isotope tracer. This research is innovative
because it leverages a unique therapeutic intervention (combination adjunct-to-insulin therapy) to achieve
meaningful improvements in insulin clearance, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance in T1D. This research
is significant because it is expected to demonstrate a novel treatment approach and justify the study of
adjunctive therapies to mitigate hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and potentially CVD risk in T1D. The
proposed studies will also provide a framework for mentored research training. The principal investigator (PI)
seeks to gain expertise in advanced human metabolic research techniques to study insulin clearance, insulin
resistance, and CVD in T1D. The PI has established a comprehensive training plan and a multidisciplinary
mentorship team with diverse but complementary expertise to achieve the research and career development
goals and transition to independence. This training will prepare the PI to pursue high impact research using
novel therapies to mitigate hormonal and metabolic imbalances in T1D, with the mission of improving the
health and wellbeing of people living with the disease."
10887170,"Project Summary
 In the U.S., emergency departments (EDs) care for >130 million patients each year. Current estimates
suggest that 5% of all ED patients experience a diagnostic error, leading to harm for 2.5 million ED patients
and death or permanent disability for 350,000 each year. The vast majority of ED patients—about 85%—are
discharged without inpatient admission, and there are no commonly used systems in place to detect diagnostic
errors or report them to ED administrators. This “blind spot” places patients at risk for harm after ED discharge
and inhibits improvements in ED diagnostic processes.
 Our Research Aims are: (1) To detect and characterize diagnostic errors among high-risk patients
discharged from the ED; (2) To detect and characterize outcomes resulting from diagnostic errors, including
healthcare utilization, severity of harm, and patient-reported nonclinical impacts; and (3) To ascertain and
characterize the work-system factors contributing to diagnostic errors.
 We will enroll 300 English- and Spanish-speaking patients who are high risk for experiencing harms if
errors occur because of their advanced age, comorbid chronic conditions, and urgent ED triage scores. In
response to recommendations from AHRQ and the National Academy of Medicine, we will use multiple data
sources to detect and characterize errors, including phone follow-up with patients, questionnaires administered
to treating ED physicians and nurses, and structured medical record review. In accordance with best practices
in patient safety research, all study measures will be determined through dual-reviewer adjudication of study
data. We anticipate that we will detect diagnostic errors in 20% of cases, which is four times the 5% error rate
that was reported in a recent systematic review.
 Our results will inform and motivate continuous quality improvement efforts locally and nationwide by
educating administrators, safety officers, clinicians, and patient advocates that errors and harms from errors
are more common than previously suspected. Moreover, our research into the work-system factors contributing
to errors will direct system-based approaches to prevent diagnostic errors and protect patients from harm.
 Part of a K08 award program, this work will train the PI in patient safety and diagnostic error research
methods; patient and clinician engagement in quality improvement/diagnostic error research; and human
factors engineering. Given strong mentoring and institutional support, this K08 award will launch the PI’s career
as an expert in solving problems with the quality and safety of emergency care, and it will prepare him to
conduct large-scale studies to develop solutions that protect patients from harm due to diagnostic errors."

Award focused on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection since 1999. Current and ongoing
research activities to be supported by this RCS Award are as follows.
 Project #1. a) Develop new prophylactic, or therapeutic approaches involving broad antiviral
and anti-inflammatory compounds formulated using novel nanoscale technologies, which are
effective against COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections. The currently proposed Merit
Review project aims to develop a simple, smart and translatable nanoscale system that combines
novel targets for antiviral- and replication and inflammation inhibitors. He currently leads two
additional projects, as a multi-PI. This proposal aims to characterize novel virus-neutralizing particles

intelligence (AI)-enhanced imaging, and preliminary data with COVID-19, he was funded by CSRD
to examine the potential to clinically diagnose and prognose COVID 19 by AI-aided chest CT.
 Project #2. Investigate and test a novel targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy (OVT) for lung
cancer using the mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) infected by RSV, which is harmless for
immunocompetent individuals. Thus, it is planned to use a 3D multicell tumoroid and biopsy-derived
cultures in vitro and mouse model of lung cancer in vivo to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OVT.
The project to data has attracted industry collaboration, which might lead to clinical trials.
 Project #3. Investigate the potential of a novel combinatorial therapeutic approach in a
mouse CCI model of moderate TBI that includes (i) a treatment to reduce inflammation (local and
systemic) using a nano-formulated siRNA against a recently discovered target, CCL20, and (ii) a
second treatment to promote neuroregeneration by MSC therapy.
 VA Impact: These highly innovative applications of nanomedicine approaches taken
together are expected to lead to high-impact clinical diagnostics and therapies for Veterans and
other Americans in need. Veterans have been proportionately affected by the pandemic, and are
increasingly affected by the incidence of lung cancers and TBI compared to the general population.
The development of these effective nanotherapeutics will greatly improve the quality of Veteran’s
healthcare."
10881810,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a common complication of anticancer treatments, such as
chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, due to treatment toxicity. In female cancer survivors
POI causes sterility, and loss of the ovarian endocrine function, which in turn results in premature
osteopenia, muscle wasting, and accelerated cardiovascular disease. These long-lasting effects are
significant, particularly for young girls reaching puberty. Our results in an ovariectomized adult mouse
model have demonstrated that transplantation of an ovarian allograft encapsulated in an
immunoisolating hydrogel-based capsule restores normal physiological endocrine ovarian function
without eliciting immune rejection. Yet, rodents present limitations for clinical translation to humans,
such as 1) the small size of a prepubertal female limits intervention before puberty and onset of puberty
is regulated differently in primates than in rodents; 2) the small size and multiovulatory character of the
mouse ovaries have a limited translational potential; and 3) the differences in immune response limit the
reach of our findings. To overcome these challenges and increase the translational potential, we propose
to extend preclinical testing of our therapy into non-human primates (NHPs). We will test the efficacy of
encapsulated ovarian allograft to initiate physiological puberty in adolescent NHPs, we will study the
longevity of graft function as well as the dynamics of the recipient’s immune response to initial and
repeat implantations and evaluate the quality of oocytes grown in capsules for fertility restoration.

10881811,"SUMMARY. The first cell fate decision in mammals transforms a totipotent embryo comprising identical cells into
two cell types: outer trophectoderm cells, which will give rise to the placenta, and inner pluripotent cells, which
will give rise to the fetus. This decision depends on cell polarization. Although we understand how cell
polarization connects to downstream signaling to specify the two cell types, the mechanisms that act earlier, to
ensure cell polarization and its specific developmental timing, remain entirely unknown. To identify this
mechanism, we first need to identify the upstream regulators, which have been elusive – until now. We recently
found that two zygotically expressed transcription factors, Tfap2c and Tead4, together with Rho-mediated
actomyosin activity, are essential and sufficient to trigger de novo cell polarization. These results provide us with
an unprecedented opportunity to determine the mechanism that triggers the specific developmental timing of
embryo polarization in early mammalian development. The objective of this proposal is to reveal the principles
of self-organization that lead to de novo polarization and consequently the first cell fate specification in the key
model mammalian embryo, the mouse embryo. Our central hypothesis is that zygotic transcription cooperates
with the cytoskeleton to polarize cells and drive the first cell fate determination. We will test this hypothesis via
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine what regulates timing of embryo polarization. We
hypothesize that the timing of embryo polarization is controlled by Tfap2c and Tead4. We will alter the dose and
developmental stage of Tfap2c and Tead4 expression and examine the effects on their downstream targets and
the timing of embryo polarization. Aim 2: To determine how the apical domain becomes established. We
hypothesize that Tfap2c and Tead4 regulate apical domain formation by modulating the actomyosin
cytoskeleton, which in turn controls the conjugation of Par complex clusters. We will use advanced imaging
techniques and pharmacological and optogenetic methods to determine the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton
in regulating apical domain formation and the dynamics of the Par complex during polarization. We will also
examine how Tfap2c and Tead4 control the behavior of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the organization of
apical proteins into clusters to form the apical domain. Aim 3: To determine how altered timing of polarization
affects embryo development. Embryo polarization always happens at the late 8-cell stage, just before the first
cell fate decision, suggesting that the invariant timing of this polarization is critical for subsequent developmental
progression. We will determine if accelerating the timing of embryo polarization by one cell cycle at the pre-
implantation stage affects subsequent development, specifically cell fate and blastocyst formation before
implantation and embryo morphogenesis post-implantation. We expect to discover the triggers and mechanisms
that regulate the precise timing of cell polarization in the mouse embryo. Our work will likely have major medical
relevance, as it will shed light on the causes of early developmental defects and pregnancy loss in humans."
10878244,"Abstract: The rapid diffusion of genetic testing across adult cancer diagnoses is a unique opportunity to
personalize cancer treatment and prevention at the population level. Germline genetic testing guidelines have
broadened to encompass nearly all patients with breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer; all patients with
advanced prostate cancer; and many patients with colorectal, endometrial, and other cancer types. The
growing use of genetic testing is driving the development of precision oncology: a new paradigm for
personalizing prevention and treatment based on genetic testing results in addition to or instead of traditionally-
measured tumor features. Increasingly, an inherited pathogenic variant in a specific gene serves as an
essential common thread that connects diverse cancer diagnoses and enables genetically-targeted cancer
therapy. However, we know virtually nothing about how genetic test results are managed across cancer types.
We pioneered the Georgia-California (GACA) Genetic Testing Linkage Initiative, linking industry-provided
genetic testing data to SEER registry records for all adults diagnosed with cancer in Georgia and California
from 2013-19. We found that genetic testing across cancer conditions has increased but rates are too low
relative to clinical recommendations. Our foundational work underscores the urgent need for research about
how well genetic testing results are broadly integrated into the management of cancer. We are now completing
the next phase of the GACA Genetic Testing Linkage Initiative: merging SEER data for all adults diagnosed
with cancer in Georgia or California from 2013-21 (N=1,826,000), with an update planned for cancers
diagnosed in 2022-23 (N=456,000), to genetic results through 2025. We will use this unique, population-based
data infrastructure to determine whether genetic testing results management is effectively personalized across
common cancers with high testing rates. We will also examine cancer mortality by genetic testing results to
inform communication about prognosis and personalized treatment. Our hypotheses are as follows:
Extensiveness of surgery (e.g., organ preservation vs. removal) is well-personalized: it is strongly associated
with clinical indications derived from tumor features, host factors and actionable genetic results, but not with
non-actionable genetic results, socioeconomic or healthcare system factors. Receipt of chemotherapy and
genetically targeted systemic therapies (immune checkpoint inhibitors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
inhibitors) is well-personalized: these treatments are strongly associated with clinical indications and actionable
genetic results, but not with non-actionable genetic results, socioeconomic or healthcare system factors.
Among cancer patients treated with systemic therapies, patients with PVs have lower cancer-specific mortality,
controlling for tumor features, treatments, comorbidities, socioeconomic and healthcare system factors."

This is a study to investigate the relationship between trajectories of alcohol use, longitudinal changes in brain
function, and the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). To address gaps in knowledge about the
relationship between alcohol use and AD, we will integrate plasma Aβ testing and a measurement of clinical
dementia into ongoing assessments of N=600 participants (age ≥ 50, 17% African American) in a large
ongoing study of alcohol use disorder. We will leverage sample collection from the St. Louis site of the
Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a longitudinal, family-based study of alcohol use
disorder funded by NIAAA for over 30 years, with extensive clinical, neuropsychological, electrophysiological,
and genetic data from families densely affected by alcohol use disorder and community-based comparison
families. The ongoing assessments of older COGA participants includes a comprehensive evaluation of alcohol
use, neurophysiological measures including resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related brain
potentials (ERPs) acquired during cognitive tasks (same as in previous longitudinal assessments), and
neuropsychological surveys. Together with existing COGA data, the new combined assessment will allow for
creation of powerful measures of alcohol use, brain function, and neuropathology.
This represents the first study to integrate AD biomarkers with comprehensive, longitudinal assessments of
alcohol use. Aim 1 will examine the effect of alcohol consumption on preclinical AD and longitudinal changes in
brain function and cognition in older adults. Aim 2 will investigate genetic, comorbid, environmental, and
demographic factors as moderating the effect of alcohol consumption on AD biomarkers and brain function.
The innovations include integration of state-of-the-art AD assessment, plasma biomarker of AD, brain function
measures of neural synchronicity and connectivity, and comprehensive longitudinal assessment of alcohol use
in a high-risk sample that has been followed over 20 years. This proposal is significant because the products
and results will apply broadly to our understanding of both the development of AD and the long-term impact of
alcohol on the brain."

 Dozens of drugs have failed in clinical trials for the inflammatory lung disease ARDS (acute
respiratory distress syndrome), largely due to 3 pharmacological challenges particular to ARDS: ARDS
patients have multi-system organ failure, so cannot tolerate off-target drug side effects; the column of
liquid covering alveoli prevents effective inhaled delivery; dozens of signaling pathways underlie ARDS,
so modulating just one will not work. To overcome these 3 challenges, we designed M-LACs, which
are 100-nanometer lipid spheres (liposomes), loaded with multiple drugs, and coated with targeting
tags that cause them to massively accumulate in the capillaries of the alveoli (air sacs of the lungs).
We have previously published on the benefits of M-LACs targeted to alveolar endothelial cells, but have
long seen the need to target the other major alveolar capillary cell type, alveolar marginated
neutrophils. Here we introduce new targeting tags that can massively concentrate M-LACs in alveolar
neutrophils. With the new ability to target LACs to both endothelium and neutrophils, we can now
answer fundamental questions in ARDS biology (Aim 1) and general pharmacology (Aim 2), while
radically improving M-LACs as a therapy for ARDS (Aim 3). Aim 1: In ​ex vivo​ human lungs and ​in vivo
mouse models of ARDS, we quantify the relative number of marginated neutrophils compared to naive
cases, and we will measure how well neutrophils and endothelial take up M-LACs. Aim 2: We will test
the “depot theory” of targeted drug delivery, which says drugs efficiently elute from targeted cells to
their neighbors. We will test whether drugs meant to act in neutrophils (e.g., neutrophil elastase
inhibitors) will ameliorate ARDS-like phenotypes the same or worse if targeted to endothelial cells, and
vice versa. Aim 3: We will identify the principles of combination therapy. We hypothesize that the most
efficacious combinations will be a pair of neutrophil- and endothelial-modulating drugs (e.g., as
opposed to 2 endothelial-modulating drugs). By the end of these studies, we will have uncovered new
ARDS biology and answered fundamental questions in pharmacology. Additionally, we will have
created a highly optimized therapy for ARDS that we will have tested in multiple mouse models of
ARDS and in human lungs."

Research: The study aims to introduce an innovative approach to estimating HIV incidence, which is very
important for national HIV programs / public health, and also for HIV prevention research, but can be
expensive and challenging to do. The specific aims are: 1) To assess adjusted viral diversity as a potential
biomarker of HIV incidence. 2) To refine results of serological screening in subsets of true- and false-recent
cases, and patients with established infection (ART-naïve and on ART), by adjusted viral diversity. We will test
whether viral diversity within the most informative regions across the HIV-1C genome adjusted for multiplicity
of transmission, recombination, and level of viral replication could be used to refine the results of serological
screening and improve specificity and sensitivity. We expect that the adjusted viral diversity within the most
informative regions will increase specificity and sensitivity in estimation of HIV incidence within the 4 subsets of
individuals targeted in this Aim to ≥95%. Establishing a cost-effective algorithm to estimate incidence is of
critical public health importance in low resource settings."

 Lung cancer is the global leader in cancer related deaths, and responsible for an estimated 1.4 million
deaths worldwide and ~160,000 deaths in the United States annually. Treatment outcomes have improved in
recent years with our recent understanding that patients can be divided into subsets based on the presence of
specific genetic mutations that occur in their tumors. These oncogenic mutations can serve as predictive
biomarkers that these tumors can be targeted with certain specific therapeutics. This approach has improved
therapeutic options for patient with certain oncogenic mutations, but not the majority of patients. Ultimately,
even the best responses to targeted therapeutics result in dramatic, but transient responses. A small
population of cells remain refractory and survive, comprising what is known as minimal residual disease
(MRD). MRD provides the molecular basis and roots that drive drug resistance - one of the most urgent clinical
struggles in the war against cancer.
 In this proposal I set out to understand the role of WT EGFR or other ERBB family members in modulating
oncogenic programs, the sensitivity to targeted therapies, and MRD in mouse and organoid models of lung
cancer. The work described in this project will allow me to use elegant genetic systems to separate out the
distinct role and contributions for WT EGFR from other ERBB family members in the context of some of the
most common molecular subtypes of lung cancer. I will also be able to define the consequences of EGFR loss
on MRD using state-of-the-art single cell RNA-sequencing technologies. Ultimately, the long-term goal of these
analyses is to identify and understand the molecular mechanisms that drive MRD and the deployment of
rational, targeted polytherapy strategies to eradicate MRD in malignant lung cancers."
10868958,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the leading genetic causes of infant mortality. SMA is caused by
deletions of or mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene that codes for the multifunctional SMN
protein. SMN2, a nearly identical copy of SMN1, fails to fully compensate for the loss of SMN1 due to
predominant skipping of exon 7. Prevention of SMN2 exon 7 skipping is a proven approach for the treatment of
SMA. Among many regulatory elements that modulate SMN2 exon 7 splicing, intronic splicing silencer N1
(ISS-N1) has been extensively validated as an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-directed therapy for SMA.
Nusinersen, an ISS-N1-targeting ASO (abbreviated as “N1ASO”), became the first FDA-approved drug for
SMA. Risdiplam, a small molecule capable of preventing SMN2 exon 7 skipping, is also approved for SMA
therapy. Gene replacement is an additional therapeutic avenue for the treatment of SMA. Current therapies of
SMA do not fully meet the needs of SMA patients, as most severe SMA patients remain wheelchair-bound
even after several years of treatment. One of the likely causes of low efficacy of available drugs for SMA is the
off-target effects at concentrations used for clinical applications. Phosphorothioate (PS) backbones present
within ASOs are known to produce off-target effects. However, off-target effects of 2¢O-Methyl (OMe) or 2¢O-
Methoxyethyl (MOE) incorporations in the sugar moiety of RNA oligonucleotides remain largely unknown.
Additional off-target effects of ASOs could be expected due to tolerance for mismatch base pairing with the
target. High concentration of a 20mer N1ASO encompassing PS/OMe modifications has been recently
reported to cause massive perturbations of the transcriptome in SMA patient cells. However, similar study has
not yet been done with Nusinersen, an 18mer N1ASO encompassing PS/MOE modifications. Also, there is no
comparative study on the concentration-dependent chemistry-specific off-target effects of N1ASOs. Unlike
PS/OMe and PS/MOE ASOs that contain negatively charged backbones, morpholino ASOs have neutral
backbones. We performed RNA-Seq on transcripts generated from SMA patient cells treated with N1ASOs
encompassing PS/OMe, PS/MOE and morpholino modifications. Our preliminary analysis and pilot validations
of RNA-Seq data reveal chemistry-specific perturbations of the transcriptome. Here we propose to fully analyze
and validate the results of RNA-Seq. In Aim 1, we will determine the nature of genes and pathways impacted
by an N1ASO encompassing three chemistries. We will determine the extent to which small, large, coding,
non-coding genes are affected by the chemistry of an N1ASO. We will validate upregulated and downregulated
genes as well as seven types of aberrant splicing events, including exon skipping, exon inclusion, enhanced
intron retention, enhanced intron removal, alternate 5ʹ splice site usage, alternate 3ʹ splice site usage and
mixed splicing events. We will analyze promoters and upstream sequences of upregulated and downregulated
genes to determine the presence of common motifs responsive to N1ASOs. We will examine if the off-target
effect on splicing is associated with splice site strengths of the affected exons. We will determine if ISS-N1-like
sequences within the affected exons and/or their flanking introns are associated with the off-target splicing. We
will examine if transfection conditions also affect the nature of off-target effects of N1ASOs. We will determine
if some of the off-target effects of N1ASOs are cell-type specific. In Aim 2, we will determine primary and
secondary targets of N1ASOs by capturing the antisense effects at early and late timepoints of the treatment
with N1ASOs, respectively. We will examine both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent targets.
We will employ minigenes to uncover the nature of sequences associated with the aberrant splicing triggered
by N1ASOs encompassing different chemistries. We will interrogate the role of ISS-N1-like sequences in the
affected exons and/or their flanking introns. Our results will reveal the required minimum complementarity
between ASO and its target for the antisense response. We will determine if the chemistry-specific off-target
effect of an N1ASO is due to a common motif within the target sequence. Outcomes of our proposed study will
have high significance for developing future ASO-based therapies for SMA as well as other diseases amenable
by ASOs encompassing PS/OMe, PS/MOE and morpholino modifications."
10869708,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The goal of most cancer treatments is to induce the apoptotic death of tumor cells; in many cases these
treatments also induce substantial off-target apoptosis in healthy tissues. Even in the absence of therapy, the
majority of prospective metastatic cells die by apoptosis, resulting in the early metastatic niche being rich in
apoptotic cell material. While numerous studies have focused on the features of tumor cells that allow them to
survive and metastasize in the face of such treatments, less attention has been paid to the influence of dying
cells themselves on cancer progression. The work proposed here will investigate the hypothesis that apoptotic
cells drive efficient metastatic spread of healthy cancer cells, because they initiate a cascade of platelet
recruitment, coagulation, and myeloid cell reprogramming at metastatic sites. We will address this hypothesis
by focusing on three Aims: First, we will address the role of phosphatidylserine exposure on apoptotic cells in
recruiting platelets and promoting tumor cell survival within the intravascular niche upon arrival of
metastasizing cells to the lung. Second, we will examine the interface between apoptotic cells, cancer cells,
and the myeloid immune network of the lung, during extravasation and establishment of the metastatic niche.
Third, we will study the effects of apoptotic cells on spontaneous metastasis from a primary tumor, and test
whether blocking pro-metastatic features of apoptotic cells can reduce metastasis in this setting. While our
work is focused on the fundamental processes by which apoptotic cells influence metastasis, we suggest that it
may point toward therapeutic combinations that prevent metastasis."
10869467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The trabecular meshwork (TM)/Schlemm’s canal (SC)-interface is critical for normal aqueous humor outflow
function and intraocular pressure. Flow across the circumference of the outflow tract is non-uniform or
segmental, with low-flow (LF) regions exhibiting higher extracellular matrix stiffness than high-flow (HF)
regions. Dysfunction of the outflow tract causes decreased aqueous drainage and consequently increased
intraocular pressure that poses a serious threat to normal vision. However, despite the strong association of
outflow impairment with development of high-pressure glaucoma, the underlying mechanisms – including
contributions from LF/HF regions – are incompletely understood. This largely stems from the inability of current
outflow tissue models to precisely simulate the dynamic TM/SC-interface at high resolution necessary for in-
depth mechanistic studies. To overcome critical limitations of previous outflow tissue replicas, this work seeks
to generate a first-in-class TM/SC-interface-on-a-chip that accurately recapitulates the outflow tissue’s complex
microenvironment and segmental elasticity profile. The novel 3D outflow tissue platform allows us to dissect
the mechanisms of resistance generation by selectively manipulating individual outflow pathway components in
ways otherwise not possible using other models. This will enable quantitative measurements of dynamic
changes at the interface in real-time, while also being compatible with critical end-point tests. Based on key
preliminary data acquired by our investigative team, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Design and validate a microfluidic chip-based TM/SC-interface to investigate dynamic outflow
regulation.
Aim 2: Investigate segmental outflow regulation using localized ECM stiffness patterns containing region-
specific TM cells.

This shared instrument grant requests funding to acquire an inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass
spectrometer (icpTOF-MS) for ultrafast laser ablation (LA)-assisted multi-elemental mapping of high-value
clinical and preclinical biospecimens. The proposed icpTOF-MS (R-series, TOFWerk) will be sited at the
Boston University School of Medicine Center for Biometallomics (CBM), the only hospital/medical school-
based analytical core facility of its kind in the region. The icpTOF-MS enables >3000 mass resolution power
for multiplexed detection of all possible elements every 30 µs. Hyphenation to the CBM’s state-of-the-art LA
platform (300 Hz laser firing rate, <4 ns pulse width, spot size to 1 µm) will accelerate NIH-funded research
requiring ultrafast multi-elemental imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) mapping at single-cell spatial resolution
in high-value organ, tissue, cell, and fluid biospecimens from humans, non-human primates, and small lab
animals (mice, rats) as well as experimental preparations, environmental samples, and other biomedically-
relevant specimens. The hyphenated LA-ICP-TOF-MS system will accelerate a core group of 11 major and 5
minor users who are funded by the NIH (NIA, NINDS, NHLBI, NIDDK) and other sponsors to conduct innovative
clinical and preclinical research on Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD-related dementias (ADRDs, including tau
protein neurodegenerative diseases, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, CTE), vascular dementia,
stroke, traumatic brain injury, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, cataracts, retinopathy, and heavy
metal toxicology linked to environmental and consumer product exposures (exposome research). The
proposed icpTOF-MS will also facilitate novel techniques (developed by CBM investigators) to detect, localize,
and quantitate microvascular dysfunction. The major user group includes NIH-funded investigators at Boston
University School of Medicine, affiliated national human tissue repositories (BU Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center, BU-Concussion Legacy Foundation-VA Boston Brain Bank, Boston Chronic Kidney Disease Research
Center, and the Framingham Heart Study,) as well as major biomedical research institutions in the region
(Mass General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, The Jackson Laboratory), across the nation (Indiana
University, UCLA, Navy Medical Research, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), and around the globe
(Queen’s University Belfast). The proposed icpTOF-MS will greatly decrease MIMS scan time while increasing
spatial resolution, simultaneous acquisition of multi-element spectra, and analytical mapping throughput.
These enhanced analytical capabilities will not only accelerate cutting-edge NIH-funded research but also
enable novel 3D mapping reconstructions, multi-elemental colocalization analyses, and other data-intensive
applications enabled by this powerful analytical technology."
10915684,"Abstract
Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are ubiquitous in biology, and their dysregulation is closely associated with
diseases, from cancer to neurodegeneration to rare genetic disorders. PPIs often form complex networks that
include highly interacting ‘hub’ proteins. Methods to modulate single interactions would provide great insight into
the functions of these hubs. Small-molecule probes and drug leads have focused on blocking PPIs; however,
stabilizing PPIs could be just as important for drug discovery and could provide greater selectivity for chemical
biology. However, there are few systematic methodologies to discover PPI stabilizers prospectively. This
proposal focuses on the systematic discovery of selective small-molecule PPI stabilizers, using the hub protein
14-3-3 as a model system. 14-3-3s are seven highly homologous adaptor proteins that bind to serine and
threonine sites on client proteins to alter their function and fate. Hundreds of proteins in signal transduction
pathways, cell-cycle regulation, transcription regulation, and protein homeostasis are clients of 14-3-3. Given the
importance of protein phosphorylation and the ubiquity of 14-3-3 as an effector of phosphorylation, it is
surprisingly underappreciated. We propose that developing a tool kit of selective, cell-active stabilizers of native
14-3-3/client PPIs will stimulate biological study and may lead to new drugs. Based on the structural diversity of
clients, we hypothesize that we can develop client-selective PPI stabilizers that bind to the composite 14-3-
3/client interface. These selective stabilizers should amplify the native biology of the 14-3-3/client complex. We
will provide proof-of-concept for this approach through three aims: Aim 1. Screen for selective stabilizers of
14-3-3/phosphopeptide clients. We have previously discovered disulfide-bound fragments that stabilize 14-3-
3/phosphopeptide complexes. We will now screen six, structurally and biologically diverse 14-3-3/client
complexes, using a native C38 residue found only on the 14-3-3 isoform. We hypothesize that client sequences
with more open or flexible structures near the C38 will yield higher quality hits. Aim 2. Optimize 14-3-3/client
stabilizers for cell-based activity. We have demonstrated the ability to convert disulfides to cell-active
electrophilic warheads and to tune the selectivity of 14-3-3/client stabilizers. We will optimize C38-bound
fragments with (or without) an electrophile with the goal of achieving target-selective PPI stabilization in cells for
the 14-3-3 clients CRAF kinase, estrogen receptor  (ER), and the transcription factor FOXO1. Aim 3. Design
PROTAC-based degraders of 14-3-3 clients. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules that induce proximity
between a ubiquitin ligase and a target, leading to the target’s degradation. We will expand the targets accessible
to PROTAC technology by using 14-3-3 as a scaffolding protein to link intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to
the ubiquitin ligase. We will first develop the technology for ER, where PROTACs are known, then translate our
learning to IDPs, including FOXO1. Successful completion of these aims will provide approaches that are broadly
applicable to the 14-3-3 network and are extendable to other native and nonnative PPIs."
10915573,"SUMMARY: Chemistry-driven strategies that allow proteins to be manipulated in ways not
permitted by standard genetics are now indispensable tools in both basic and applied
aspects of biomedical science. Of the various platform technologies in common use, those
that rely on manipulation of intein-mediated protein splicing have proven especially
powerful owing to broad compatibility with both in vitro and in vivo applications. Work
performed during the current funding period has led to the discovery, characterization and
eventual engineering of several inteins, especially those split into two mutually-dependent
fragments that support protein trans-splicing upon complexation. We have employed
these ‘protein ligases’ to solve a number of biochemical problems, primarily in the
chromatin biology area. In the next phase of this program, we will exploit recent advances
in our understanding of protein trans-splicing, to develop split intein tools designed to
address a series of problems also in the area of epigenetics. Accordingly, a concerted
protein ‘transposition’ reaction will be developed that allows replacement of internal
regions of intact target proteins with synthetic cassettes containing chemical probes such
as crosslinkers and photosensitizers (Aim 1). This cut-and paste system will be used to
define and manipulate epigenetic complexes involved in higher-order chromatin structure.
We will also develop various controllable versions of split inteins for use in both basic
science and synthetic biology applications. In one line of enquiry (Aim 2), we will use these
tools to rapidly generate oncofusion proteins such AML-ETO, thereby allowing
characterization of the early stages of cell transformation. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will develop
protein ‘actuators’ that use conditional protein splicing to convert a biochemical input of
choice into a user-defined biochemical output. These ‘actuators’ will form the basis of
epigenetic circuits that are dependent on Boolean logic operations and that allow higher-
order chromatin complexes to be monitored in cells. While our focus is in the epigenetic
area, we imagine that the technologies developed in the context of this work will expand
the type of protein systems, and hence biological problems, accessible to interrogation
through chemical biology strategies."

Concurrent with a dramatic rise in social media use, youth in the United States are reporting high rates of peer
victimization and mental distress. Treatment-modifiable elements of the relationship between online social
messaging, mental distress, and peer victimization are unclear. This lack of clarity is partly because prior work
relies primarily on “snapshots” of these social connections, in which youth self-report on their social media use
and related experiences at a single point in time. More intensive sampling and real-time characterization of
adolescents’ social worlds is needed to develop better interventions and guidance for clinicians, youth, and
parents. This work is particularly urgent among youth with high rates of online and in-person victimization. We
have previously recruited and retained high-risk samples of youth from the emergency department (ED), who
report high cross-sectional and longitudinal rates of peer victimization, mental distress, and social media use,
for both intervention and cohort studies. This research project, developed in response to PA 19-373, proposes
an innovative combination of methods from our prior work. We will enroll 240 adolescents (age 13-17)
presenting to the ED for any medical or injury complaint in a 6-month cohort study. Using recruitment,
sampling, and follow-up methods similar to our prior work, we will intensively collect online social messaging
(“OSM”), in-person interactions (using the Electronically Activated Recorder, or “EAR”, which collects snippets
of codable audio), and self-perceived mood, loneliness, and peer victimization (using ecological momentary
assessments, or “EMA”) for 1 month. We will administer validated self-report surveys at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months.
Finally, we will collect continuous OSM data from 2 weeks prior to recruitment to the end of the 6-month study.
We will use advanced computational modeling, as previously piloted by our group, to align and integrate OSM,
EAR, and EMA data, and develop nuanced descriptions of at-risk youth’s social connection and isolation. We
will then examine the relationship between their social connectedness, peer victimization, and future
psychological well-being, and will explore how demographic and other vulnerability factors influence this
relationship. SIGNIFICANCE: Consistent with the NICHD strategic plan, our methodology as well as the unique
composition of our research team ensures that our research is aimed at identification of “targets for behavioral
intervention.” Our findings will inform future in-person and population-level interventions to improve patterns of
social connectedness, reduce peer victimization, and improve well-being among at-risk adolescents."
10909143,"Exceedingly high mutation rates permit most RNA viruses to rapidly explore protein sequence space. On the other hand, high mutation rates also result in widespread production of viral protein variants with poor biophysical properties and severe folding defects. Protein variants that cannot fold successfully are removed from the population, even if they could otherwise confer a beneficial adaptive function. Recent work has revealed that the composition and activities of the host cell’s protein folding and quality control machinery (the proteostasis network) play a central role in defining the amino acid sequence space accessible to rapidly evolving RNA viral proteins. This phenomenon has so far largely been explored using proteostasis modulation itself as the selection pressure. It is not yet clear whether host cell chaperones are directly – by enhancing viral protein folding – impacting the ability of viruses to adapt to and escape from external selection pressures stemming from the host’s adaptive immune system, antiviral drugs, or other factors. Using influenza as a model system, this proposal integrates state-of-the-art chemical biology, genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods to comprehensively evaluate and elucidate, at the molecular-level, the emerging and complex interplay between host proteostasis and viral adaptation in the context of diverse selection pressures. Aim 1 focuses on the mechanism by which hijacked host chaperones promote influenza escape from innate immune system factors, establishing biophysical origins of host chaperone-dependence in influenza nucleoprotein evolution and elucidating whether and how the virus can readily adapt to challenging host proteo- stasis environments. Aim 2 establishes how the composition and activities of the host cell’s endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network impact the ability of influenza hemagglutinin, the primary target of influenza-neutralizing antibodies, to escape selection pressure from the adaptive immune system. Aim 3 operates on a broader scale to understand how host proteostasis networks impact genome-wide mutational tolerance and influenza error catastrophe, a phenomenon in which increasing viral mutation rates past a certain threshold causes population extinction. Experimental findings from all these Aims are integrated with protein biophysical studies and computational modeling to illuminate molecular origins of host proteostasis-dependent viral adaptation. This work is expected to establish host proteostasis as a defining force that shapes viral adaptation, particularly in the context of highly relevant selection pressures. Beyond fundamental elucidation of viral evolution, findings will greatly enhance understanding of the factors involved in viral adaptation to host selection pressures and, in the longer-term, improve the ability to accurately predict viral evolution. Discoveries are also expected to highlight the potential of therapeutic adjuvants targeting host chaperones to enable treatment regimens to which viruses cannot easily evolve resistance. Contributions will impact fields ranging from basic virology and vaccine and antiviral drug development to evolutionary biology and protein folding biophysics."

Genetically-modified mouse models have proven to be essential for the production of antibody-related
biological drugs (biologics). To date, the majority of biologics originate from mouse models, and small animal
models are used not only to generate the antibodies, but also as a platform for further optimization and testing
of the biologics. Camelid-based antibodies, which have superior antigen binding and physicochemical
properties (stability, hydrophilicity, etc.) have not realized their full potential, to the same extent that
conventional antibodies have. This is founded in the logistic and financial hurdles immunization of camelids
pose for monoclonal heavy-chain antibody (HCAb) production and the fact that in vitro technologies cannot
fully recapitulate the exceptional natural selection towards extremely diversified, high-affinity binders that
occurs in animals. In this SBIR project we propose to develop genetic platforms in a murine host for the
discovery and development of partially humanized hybrid HCAbs (and their products). Since their discovery in
the early 1990s, HCAbs have generated progressive interest in the biotech, diagnostic and therapeutic fields
due to their intrinsic properties and adaptability. Apart from a small size paired with robustness and superior
access to difficult epitopes, HCAbs can be easily processed into, and utilized as, single domain binding units
(VHH) while preserving their affinity towards antigens (in contrast to conventional antibodies). The proposed
targeted mouse models carrying an engineered immunoglobulin locus will potentiate the production of high
affinity HCAbs by serving as an alternative, hybrid Ab host. It will allow natural, in vivo affinity-maturation of
antigen-specific HCAbs in a small animal platform, one amenable to further genetic manipulation. It will enable
larger cohort sizes than the natural camelid hosts, and streamline HCAb generation, thus providing further
potential for the development of HCAb and VHH domains for downstream applications. In our Aim 1, we focus
on honing and characterizing our hybrid camelid immunoglobulin locus by adding more camelid VHHs and
introducing modified human VHs into the locus while also evaluating B-cell development and antibody affininty
and diversity. In Aim 2, our focus is to benchmark the the repertoire and efficiency of the Ab response with
competing technologies by using disease-relevant, difficult antigens and progress promising hits to hybridoma
development and larger scale antibody production. In accomplishing these milestone based Aims, we will be
able to develop our business and begin licensing of the platforms to individual labs and established
pharmaceutical companies to support discovery of novel antibodies for high-value targets."

The risk associated with both untreated depression and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
treatment has presented a significant dilemma to the 20% of pregnant women suffering from prenatal
depression and their clinicians. Both prenatal depression and SSRIs have been found to adversely impact fetal
brain development. However, the limited epidemiologic research on neurodevelopmental outcomes of the
offspring suffers severe methodological limitations and thus, the literature is inconclusive. The proposed study
addresses these methodological limitations and leverages Kaiser Permanente Northern California’s (KPNC’s)
unique universal perinatal depression screening program to assemble a longitudinal birth cohort of >320,000
children from 0 to 8 years of age born between 2013-2020. As part of standard prenatal care, women are
screened for depression twice during pregnancy (at the first prenatal visit and 26-28 weeks) providing a large
cohort of women with depression and its severity measures throughout pregnancy. In addition, KPNC’s
universal childhood developmental screening program provides systematic screening for neurodevelopmental
disorders. The primary outcomes will be six neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses defined in the DSM 5:
intellectual disability, global developmental delay, motor disorders, communication disorder, autism spectrum
disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); corresponding diagnosis codes will be
ascertained from KPNC’s electronic health records (EHR) and supplemented through linkage to California’s
Department of Developmental Services. We will use KPNC EHRs to ascertain information on important
confounders and link to the father’s medical records to ascertain information on psychiatric history. We will test
the hypothesis that the underlying prenatal depression and SSRIs are independent risk factors for adverse
neurodevelopmental outcomes and may differ by infant sex. We will evaluate the effect of untreated prenatal
depression, compared to no prenatal depression on the six neurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring,
after adjusting for confounders. We will also assess the effects of treatment with SSRIs during pregnancy on
neurodevelopmental outcomes of the offspring compared to both untreated prenatal depression and treatment
with psychotherapy only, while taking into account depression severity and other confounders. Finally, to
examine their impact on less severe neurodevelopmental outcomes we will recruit a subsample of 2,000 5-
year old children (500 randomly chosen from each of four exposure categories: no prenatal depression,
untreated prenatal depression, treatment with SSRIs, treatment with psychotherapy only) to ascertain
information through parent interview on neurodevelopmental outcomes that may not meet the criteria of a
clinical diagnosis, but may suggest a need to monitor and/or provide early interventions. Findings from this
study will have significant public health and clinical implications by providing information that can be
immediately used by pregnant women and clinicians making treatment decisions."

program is to address the as yet unmet need to train more committed physician-scientist anesthesiologists.
PPRTPM program direction, aims and objectives: Program leadership will be provided by Dr. Max Kelz,
serving as contact PI, with further leadership provided by additional Executive Committee members Drs.
Gordon Barr, Maurizio Cereda, Renyu Liu, and Roderic Eckenhoff. All are members of the University of
Pennsylvania Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care. Their responsibilities will be focused on
directing four theme-based research training tracks, three of which are devoted to laboratory research trainees
and one of which is devoted to clinical research trainees gaining research training in perioperative medicine.
The aims of the PPRTPM are to:
 • Identify, recruit and foster research trainees, both anesthesiology residents and clinical sub-specialty
 fellows willing to commit to training and career development in perioperative medicine research
 • Match up trainees strengths and interests with mentoring teams
 • Provide guidance for structured learning opportunities

Tobacco use is highly prevalent among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) especially in southern Africa where
HIV is most heavily concentrated. Among PLWH, tobacco use impacts HIV-related co-morbidities and is the
leading cause of premature mortality from non-HIV related malignancies such as lung cancer which account for
20% of the cancer burden. Integrating an evidence-based intervention, such as Screening, Brief Intervention and
Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) into a HIV care system presents an important opportunity to establish and
evaluate a modifiable cancer prevention strategy into a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting where
both lay health workers (LHW) and non-physician clinicians are widely used. Botswana, where the University of
Maryland Baltimore (UMB) has worked since 2015, oversees a wide network of HIV care clinics for its citizens.
Demographic Health Surveys from sub-Saharan Africa show that smoking prevalence among PLWH ranges
12.5-44.3%. Yet, based on our pilot data the system of care is highly unprepared to meet the challenge of
integrating evidence-based smoking cessation treatment into routine HIV care. The Government of Botswana
wants more to be done to assist its citizen in smoking cessation. To meet this challenge, the Botswana Smoking
Abstinence Reinforcement Trial (BSMART) proposes to use a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study
design to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a well-established SBIRT intervention consisting of
the 5As, (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) delivered by trained LHW case managers, followed by referral
to treatment with varenicline (a medication demonstrated to be efficacious for smoking cessation among
PLWH1-3 and on formulary in Botswana) prescribed and monitored by trained nurse prescribers-dispensers, in
the network of outpatient HIV care facilities in Botswana. The specific aims guided by the RE-AIM Framework
and informed by an Implementation Governance Structure are to: 1) Assess Reach and Effectiveness of
BSMART; 2) Assess the Adoption and Implementation indexed by quality and consistency of intervention
delivery; 3) Assess whether the intervention becomes Maintained as part of routine practices; 4) Determine the
preliminary cost-effectiveness of BSMART."

collaborations with several co-investigators across the Center Projects. The SCA will pursue the following four
aims:
Aim 1: To perform computational analysis of genomic data to identify new risk genes and develop composite
genomic risk scores that predict autism risk based on genetic variants across the entire allele frequency spectrum
(Project 1 analyses).
Aim 2: To conduct statistical analysis of survey and behavioral outcomes in the PROGRESS cohort to model
parental outcomes and effects of genetic risk on children’s longitudinal neurobehavioral development (Project 2
and 3 analyses).
Aim 3: To integrate genetic, caregiver, and infant neurobehavioral development data across projects to obtain
a complete picture of children’s autism risk signatures (cross-Project analyses).
Aim 4: To maximize data quality and availability in all PROGRESS Center research, including through a central
data management platform that ensures rigor and reproducibility.
By integrating a robust data management and analytic pipeline with population-based, longitudinal data
collection, the SCA Core will allow the PROGRESS Center to reveal the implications of early life genetic
information, integrating genomic risk with neurodevelopmental trajectories and family impact."
10916382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The PROGRESS in Autism Center of Excellence will conduct three inter-related Research Projects to
understand how identifying genetic variants associated with high risk for autism shortly after birth predicts risk
for altered neurodevelopmental trajectories and autism diagnosis, and how this identification affects parents’
experience, attitudes, and decision-making. The three proposed PROGRESS Research Projects are built around
a cohort of 240 infants at identified genetic risk (IGR), and 120 infants without identified genetic risk (non-IGR)
found amongst 100,000 healthy newborns screened using genome sequencing from the currently funded
GUARDIAN project. Project 1 will identify genes and genetic variants that increase autism risk using existing
genomic datasets to identify the IGR group prospectively. Project 2 will examine the impact of receiving a
molecular genetic diagnosis on stress, well-being, and decision-making for intervention in parents of the IGR
group. Project 3 will longitudinally assess the IGR group to identify emerging neurodevelopmental (biological,
cognitive, behavioral) markers to predict later autism diagnosis.
 The Assessment Core will implement screening at 18 months for children in both groups. Any child
screening positive will either be referred for an expedited evaluation. At 24 months, the Assessment Core will
provide comprehensive, rigorous, standardized, and cost-effective autism diagnostic evaluations of the IGR
group. The result of this evaluation will provide phenotypic and diagnostic information for the PROGRESS
Center’s primary outcome variable – whether or not the child meets the criteria for autism. In addition to providing
screening at 24 months for the non-IGR group (and diagnostic evaluation for those who screen positive), the
Assessment Core will again screen those children in either group who reach 36 months by the end of the project,
and, if positive, refer for an expedited evaluation. The Assessment Core will draw on an experienced team of
pediatric neuropsychologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists who are experts in evaluating autism and other
neurodevelopmental disorders to provide the best estimate diagnosis. The Assessment Core will relay diagnostic
information to parents and coordinate the curation of Assessment Core data with the Statistical and
Computational Analysis (SCA) Core, leveraging the resources of the NYP / Weill Cornell / CU Center for Autism
and the Developing Brain (CADB). Phenotypic information and post-evaluation surveys will be shared with the
Research Projects to accomplish their Aims."
10916384,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The heritability of autism has been estimated to be > 80%; therefore, genetics should be a powerful tool to
predict risk of autism. Newborn screening using genomic sequencing is a platform that can deliver genetic
diagnoses before autism symptoms emerge – providing the opportunity for early intervention which improves
autism outcomes. Independent of this proposal, we are conducting a pilot study (GUARDIAN) of genome
sequencing as a new platform for traditional newborn screening in a diverse New York City population. In
GUARDIAN, parents will have the option to receive results for at least 100 monogenic conditions for which the
genetic variants are highly penetrant for some impact on the brain and behavior, and on average ~20% of
individuals with the risk variant have autism. The individuals with monogenic conditions and autism often have
challenges with self-injurious behavior, have poorer adaptation, are less independent, and have associated
lower quality of life and greater family burden. It is unclear what factors determine which of the individuals with
the monogenic risk factor will develop autism (including other rare or common inherited genetic variants or
other factors) and whether it is possible to predict, among infants with these risk variants, who will develop
autism and perhaps benefit from behavioral interventions. The key to accurately predicting risk with genetics is
to identify all risk genes and variants and precisely estimate their effect size. Inherited, rare, moderate-risk
variants, and common variants of individually small effect are a major contributor to autism risk in aggregation,
but the majority of these genes or variants have not been identified. As the genomic data increase in autism
cohorts including SPARK, there will be substantially improved power to more completely understand the
genomic architecture and identify new genes and variants and quantify the autism risk for these variants. In
Project 1, we propose to identify the PROGRESS Cohort: newborns at high risk for autism in a diverse New
York City population. We will screen a large (~100,000) population-based cohort of newborns in GUARDIAN
and identify an unbiased group of infants with monogenic susceptibility to highly penetrant neurogenetic
conditions that increase the risk of autism (IGR, N=400) and return these genetic results to parents within 6
weeks of life. Of these infants identified in GUARDIAN, 240 will be consented for Projects 2 and 3. We will
identify a comparison group of 120 infants without monogenic risk (non-IGR). Using large autism cohorts we
will identify additional genes and genetic variants that confer risk of autism and test genetic models including
high, moderate, and low risk genetic variants and family history to develop a composite genomic risk score and
apply it in our PROGRESS cohort of newborns at identified genetic risk (IGR) of autism. The prospective
assessment of neurobehavioral development of this cohort (Project 3) will provide infant neurodevelopmental
trajectories that will be combined with the composite genomic risk score to generate an integrated autism risk
score (Projects 1 and 3)."

Project Title: The Role of Adenine Nucleotide Translocase in Mitochondrial Dysfunction
Associated Senescence in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
PI: Corrine Kliment, MD, PhD
Applicant Trainee: Ugonna Mbaekwe, B.S.
Abstract:
COPD is a prevalent disease characterized by chronic inflammation, abnormal epithelial repair
and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Major risk factors for COPD include cigarette smoke
(CS) exposure, air pollution and genetics [1,2], leading to millions of affected individuals
worldwide with few effective treatments. We seek to better understand mechanisms of disease
pathogenesis to develop therapies that will halt or reverse COPD development. The objective of
this research project is to determine how adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2), a prominent
mitochondrial ATP transporter, alters mitochondrial function to influence lung epithelial cell repair
and senescence in smoking-induced lung injury and COPD. The research performed under this
diversity supplement is an integral part of the approved, ongoing research under the parent
R01. The parent R01 has 3 primary aims: 1) To test the hypothesis that loss of ANT2 in AEC2
cells drives senescence by increasing ROS and the DNA damage response (DDR). 2) To test
the hypothesis that loss of ANT2 shifts AEC2 metabolism and decreases repair capacity to
promote COPD; and 3) To test the hypothesis that therapeutic restoration of ANT2 or removal of
senescent cells can protect against emphysema. This diversity supplement will specifically
focus on the mechanism of senescence and ferroptosis, a form of cell death, in lung repair. The
connection between ferroptosis and senescence in lung disease remains unknown. Research
under this supplement will evaluate novel links between the senescence and ferroptosis
pathways in the context of the parent R01 studies. This is an exciting and logical extension of
the studies outlined in the R01."
10914538,"Abstract
Cannabinoids and compounds made from Cannabis have a diverse range of therapeutic potentials, including
novel treatments for pain, seizure disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, addiction, and cancer. The Cannabis
plant itself produces over 400 unique compounds, 100 of which are bioactive cannabinoids that can activate the
endocannabinoid system through activating the G-protein-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2. The interest in
developing effective cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals has only grown in recent years, with four FDA-
approved drugs on the market, and 200 trials in progress for a variety of therapeutic applications. Despite their
high therapeutic promise, critical issues in cannabinoid production have strained the commercial supply
chain. Cannibis plant cultivation uses large amounts of water and energy, and the realities of agricultural
production result in variable year-to-year yields and pesticide impurities. Adding to the issue, the purification
process of a specific cannabinoid from the many compounds produced by Cannibis plants are extremely labor
and manufacturing intensive, leading to prohibitively expensive final products. To overcome these challenges,
Cellibre is developing a fermentation-based microbial engineering and biofactory platform to produce
high-quality, cost-effective cannabinoids. This method has the potential to reduce the costs of cannabinoid
manufacturing by 5-10x and establish Cellibre as cost-effective, environmentally friendly leader in cannabinoid
manufacturing. By selecting bacterial and yest strains that naturally produce high concentrations of cannabinoid
precursors, then bioengineering them to encourage cannabinoid synthesis, Cellibre has yielded fermentations
of THCVA (2.7 g/L), CBGA (3.9 g/L) and other minor cannabinoids (i.e CBCA ~1.5 g/L) of high interest to
drug development. To accelerate these breakthroughs from proof of concept to scalable commercial platforms,
this Direct to Phase II project has the following two specific aims: 1) De-bottleneck metabolic pathways to achieve
>5 g/L of CBGA and THCVA, 2) Establish a process ready for technology transfer with an overall COGS
<$500/kg. These aims will result in the development of a pipeline capable of producing therapeutically relevant
cannabinoids at commercially viable titers, paving the way for the development and effective production of
cannabinoid-based treatments for a wide range of devastating diseases."
10916187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic sequencing of tumor samples is now a routine component of cancer care, providing unprecedented
insight into cancer initiation, progression, and treatment effects. Additionally, novel molecular profiling and
imaging techniques are gaining traction, generating ever more data. Ensuring that these data sets are easily
accessible and interpretable to scientists and clinicians is of vital importance. Towards this end, we seek to
evolve and expand the capabilities of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, a unique platform that enables
interactive exploratory analysis of large-scale cancer genomic data. The cBioPortal is the most widely used
and most highly cited tool within the cancer genomics community. The public site, with data from 325 cancer
studies, is accessed by >34,000 unique users each month. The cBioPortal instance that supports AACR
Project GENIE, a multi-institutional data sharing initiative, now hosts genomic profiles from >120,000 tumors.
Since the software is available under an open source license, >65 cancer centers and pharmaceutical
companies have institutional installations of cBioPortal to analyze their own data. Multiple institutions are
making contributions to the software, including the five that are part of this application (Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Princess Margaret Cancer
Centre, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia). To ensure that this vital resource continues to aid the cancer
research community and to keep pace with the rapidly advancing fields of cancer genomics and precision
cancer medicine, including the continuing increase in the number of profiled tumor samples, we propose to
actively sustain and evolve the cBioPortal platform. Specifically, we plan to make improvements across the
entire cBioPortal software architecture (Aim 1); this includes significant changes to address key performance
bottlenecks, a new API capable of supporting federated queries, a new App Store, and improvements to our
cloud infrastructure and data pipelines. We will also support several new molecular data types, add two entirely
new cBioPortal views, develop new features for precision oncology, and improve general usability (Aim 2). We
propose to continue funding a group of core developers across five institutions, expand the base of code
contributors, and continue to collaborate with The Hyve to support biotech and pharmaceutical companies (Aim
3). Finally, to maximize use in the scientific community, we plan to continue to improve community outreach,
user support, and training (Aim 4). These improvements will be necessary to ensure that cBioPortal continues
to provide an essential service for cancer research and development of new biomarkers and drugs, especially
as more cancer centers are using the cBioPortal as part of their precision medicine programs, and as
pharmaceutical companies are using it for internal research. We expect that, over the next few years, the
cBioPortal will continue to have a strong impact on all areas of cancer research and patient care."

Meiosis is the process by which a diploid cell gives rise to haploid gamete cells and is essential for sexual
reproduction. This conserved cell division program is driven by a specialized transcriptome, which supports
complex chromosome behaviors that are integrated with cell cycle progression. Errors in meiotic chromosome
behaviors are a major cause of aneuploidy, and thus of miscarriage and birth anomalies in humans. My research
program aims to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms of meiosis, and of the processes that
regulate gene expression and chromosome behaviors in the germline. We use mouse to explore these critical
aspects of cell biology. Our current research primarily focuses on two pathways that regulate meiosis, one cell-
autonomous and one non-cell-autonomous, as outlined below:
· The switch from mitosis to meiosis is a critical cell fate transition that involves complete remodeling of the
transcriptome, but little is known about the mechanisms regulating this change in mammals. Our recent work
identified an essential pathway that controls the mitosis-to-meiosis switch. In this pathway, the RNA helicase
YTHDC2, along with its binding partner MEIOC, regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally via direct
interaction with RNA targets. How this regulation is accomplished remains unclear, however. Powerful methods
for mapping genome-wide protein-RNA interactions and innovative structure-function mutants will be exploited
to define how this machinery controls gene expression, how it recognizes and engages RNA, and how it
intersects with other cellular machinery to regulate meiotic progression.
· Metazoan cells undergo meiosis in a syncytium, sharing cytoplasm and RNA between cells. This is an
essential feature of meiosis, as disruption of cytoplasmic sharing by genetic ablation of the intercellular bridges
connecting meiotic cells leads to meiotic failure and infertility in male mice. However, the underlying functional
significance of cytoplasmic sharing via intercellular bridges is poorly understood. Recent advances inform
hypotheses about the roles of cytoplasmic sharing in regulating gene expression and meiotic chromosome
dynamics. We will leverage advances in microscopy and single-cell genomics to test these and to determine the
roles of this striking, evolutionarily conserved meiotic feature."

MinION sequencing technology, giving them first-hand experience with the preparation of genomic DNA samples
for sequencing, in school DNA sequencing, tools for determining the makeup of microbial communities from
sequencing data, and the construction of a microbial genome through the compilation of a large number of
overlapping long MinION sequence reads. The project will include a week-long teacher professional
development covering hands on experience with all aspects of project activities in the summer, followed by three
different day-long refresher training sessions for teachers during the school year. Students will perform identical
project activities during the academic year under the guidance of their teachers and faculty from the partnership.
Year one of the proposal will be formative, involving two schools and three teachers along with a total of 30
students. Years 2-5 will have ten intervention teachers and 100 students per year take part, who will be
compared with a total of 30 teachers and 300 students as matched controls in years 2-4 as part of the evaluation
plan. Students and teachers will present data at an annual capstone event each spring. Their data on waterway
quality will in addition be shared and publicized by BNW, and their microbial genome sequencing data will
ultimately be shared on GenBank. The authentic research experiences for students involving new DNA
sequencing technology and big data manipulations will increase their interest, engagement and future
performance in STEM, and positively influence their long-term STEM and health-related career goals."
10916395,"ABSTRACT
Annually, approximately 25% of US teens and young adults sustain physical, psychological, or sexual abuse
by dating partners. Many victims of dating violence (DV) experience negative and long-lasting consequences,
including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidality, risky sexual behavior, substance misuse,
academic disengagement, and adulthood intimate partner violence. Perpetrators of adolescent DV are at
increased risk for continuing intimate partner violence in adulthood. Moreover, partner violence is costly to
Americans, with one estimate putting the population economic burden at $3.6 trillion over victims' lifetimes.
Given the prevalence, costs, and adverse mental, physical, and social health outcomes, effective and enduring
prevention strategies are critically needed. Thus, we conducted an RCT of the 7th grade version of Fourth R in
24 middle schools (12 intervention schools, 12 control schools; n=2865 students) and found that students who
received the intervention were significantly less likely to perpetrate DV. We propose to extend our school-
based cluster RCT by 1) collecting an additional four years of annual follow-ups, when participants will be, on
average, 21 years old and 8 years post-intervention; 2) augmenting data with school, neighborhood, and
environmental factors that may moderate program impact; and 3) delivering a text-based booster to half of the
students originally randomized to the intervention condition (n=666) and comparing them to students from
control schools (n=1533) and to those who received Fourth R without a booster (n=666).
Specific aims: 1) Determine the long-term impact of Fourth R in reducing DV, as indexed by less perpetration
and victimization of physical, sexual, and psychological DV through adolescence and into emerging adulthood,
relative to participants from control schools; 2) Determine the long-term impact of Fourth R, relative to control,
in a) enhancing emotional well-being and increasing acquisition and use of healthy relationship skills, as
indexed by improved problem-solving, communication, and conflict resolution skills through adolescence and
into emerging adulthood; and b) ameliorating the modifiable cognitive and behavioral correlates associated
with the perpetration and victimization of DV, as indexed by fewer attitudes justifying DV, decreased substance
misuse and risky sexual behavior, increased school connectedness, improved academic performance, and
decreased psychological symptoms through adolescence and into emerging adulthood; 3) Test the hypothesis
that participants receiving an 18-week, 54-message text-based booster five years after receiving the Fourth R
intervention will be least likely to perpetrate and experience DV and other risky behaviors, followed by students
who received Fourth R without the booster, followed by participants in the control group; and 4) Evaluate the
cost-effectiveness and fiscal impact of the Fourth R intervention and text-based booster.
Preventing DV throughout the formative years has the enormous potential to improve the health, relationships,
and wellbeing of countless lives, while also reducing the economic burden of this public health crisis."
10910556,"Project Summary/Abstract
Primate brains develop following an exquisitely conserved Bauplan that is shared with other mammals, yet also
possess advanced cognitive capabilities. These capabilities manifest from innovations to cellular and molecular
repertoires, but the developmental origin of these evolutionary modifications has remained elusive due to lack
of tools that enable access to primate neurodevelopmental processes. A major evolutionary modification is the
expansion of the neocortex. Within the neocortex, areas associated with higher-order cognitive functions (and
their disorders) have expanded disproportionately relative to areas that process sensory information. The
increase in cortical territory devoted to higher-order processing has been accompanied by fundamental
differences in neocortical cell type composition (the absolute and relative proportions of different cell types),
gene expression, and cell-cell connectivity properties. For example, unlike sensory areas, higher-order areas
are typified by long-range connectivity to other higher-order areas. Mechanisms for the establishment of
primary sensory areas and their connectivity have been worked out in mice, but it is not known whether these
rules are conserved in primates, especially in expanded higher-order neocortex which lacks a rodent homolog.
Thus, we lack understanding of when and why higher-order areas establish their unique cellular characteristics
and come to disproportionately connect to each other to form the long-range networks in primate brains. This
proposal seeks to address this gap by applying modern molecular tools and genomic analyses to discover
rules for the development and connectivity of sensory and higher order areas in the common marmoset, an
emerging and genetically tractable primate model species. Cellular lineage tracing methods delivered in utero
to developing marmosets will be paired with single cell RNA and DNA sequencing to reconstruct lineage
relationships and progenitor population demographics across sensory and higher order areas. Lineage-
resolved spatial sequencing will determine how clonal dispersion statistics differ between primary sensory and
higher-order areas, and between marmosets and mice. Emerging technologies for reconstructing the
connections between individual cells, such as those based on barcoded, synapse-transiting viruses, will reveal
how and when connectivity is established across brain areas. Marmosets offer distinct advantages for this
program, including a high-quality genome, small size, and rapid sexual maturity, while retaining primate-
specific brain features such as expanded higher-order cortex and long-range connectivity. This research
program leverages the power of quantitative genomic measurement and cell type-resolved recording
technologies to reconstruct the developmental and evolutionary histories of primate brain specializations. The
knowledge and expertise gained by developing this expanded toolbox will improve access to developmental
processes in non-traditional model species broadly. It will also be foundational for the development and
assessment of NHP preclinical models for genetic perturbations that affect brain development."

The older cancer survivor is particularly affected by cancer and its treatments with numerous physical, mental,
and psychosocial short- and long-term side effects, such as an increase in risk to experience chronic pain
symptoms. Strong evidence indicates physical activity is correlated with lower rated symptoms of chronic pain.
Despite the known benefits of physical activity, only 7% of older cancer survivors meet current physical activity
recommendations. High ratings of pain are associated with low physical activity levels in older cancer
survivors. Therefore, it is critical to understand how and when to best deliver physical activity intervention
health messaging to reduce chronic pain symptoms among older cancer survivors who experience chronic
pain symptoms. This application proposes the career development plan for Dr. Whitney Welch to establish an
independent research program examining the relationship between physical activity and the maintenance of
independence through the reduction of chronic symptoms among older cancer survivors. Dr. Welch's career
development will be supported by an exceptional interdisciplinary group of investigators with a lengthy history
of federal funding and a track record of successful mentorships. Her mentors, Dr. Rini, Dr. Spring, and Dr. Wolf
are internationally recognized scholars in the areas of cancer survivorship, adaptive intervention design, and
health literacy and health communications, respectively. The overall aim of this application is to develop and
test the timing of physical activity promotion messages to increase physical activity and reduce pain symptoms
among older cancer survivors who experience chronic pain symptoms using a micro-randomized trial design.
In Aim 1, we propose to use a patient-centered, health literacy approach to develop and select theory-based
health messaging that increase survivors' likelihood of engaging in physical activity tailored to their current pain
symptoms. In Aim 2, we will conduct a micro-randomized trial, a new experimental design developed to
optimize the construction of in-the-moment interventions, to determine the optimal pain state (pain/no pain) to
deliver a message to increase physical activity and the probability that older cancer survivors will engage in
physical activity. Finally, we propose an exploratory aim to determine the optimal pain state (pain/no pain) to
deliver the message to increase physical activity and the probability participants will experience a subsequent
pain episode. Results from this study will provide a robust foundation for a R01 submission to conduct a just-in-
time adaptive physical activity intervention to manage pain symptoms in older cancer survivors. This award will
directly lead to the establishment of an independent research program in physical activity and health research
among older cancer survivors."
10913433,"Project Summary: Gender minority individuals (GM; transgender and gender non-conforming), an NIH-
designated disparity population (NOT-MD-19-001), experience numerous health disparities including high rates
of hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD). GMs also have culturally-distinct life experiences that can
further increase alcohol risk. Standard alcohol treatment programs often neglect such GM-specific experiences.
Cultural adaptation can improve treatment acceptability, retention, and effectiveness in minority populations by
increasing treatment compatibility with patients’ cultural norms/values. Despite alcohol disparities and unique
risk factors, there are no evidence-based alcohol interventions for this marginalized population.
 In this application, Dr. Jeremy Kidd proposes a comprehensive path toward becoming an independent
physician-researcher of innovative treatments for alcohol and drug use disorders among GMs. Specifically, this
proposal follows the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapies Research to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a
culturally-adapted psychosocial intervention for AUD among GMs. Cultural adaptation will address the specific
types of interpersonal disruptions (e.g., with family, friends, coworkers) that many GMs experience due to gender
transition or anti-GM discrimination/stigma. These disruptions result in interpersonal distress that increases
alcohol risk. In Stage 0 formative research, Dr. Kidd will use latent class analysis to examine the relationship
between social support and trajectories of hazardous drinking in an established multi-site, longitudinal cohort of
GMs (N = 330). Next, he will employ qualitative descriptive methodologies to conduct individual semi-structured
interviews with cohort members (N = 48) to understand in-depth how interpersonal factors influence GM drinking.
He will use these formative findings to develop a culturally-adapted AUD intervention for GMs. He will use
interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) as a platform for adaptation because it is evidence-based for alleviating
interpersonally-mediated psychological distress. Finally, Dr. Kidd will evaluate this intervention’s feasibility by
delivering it to 20 GM individuals with AUD in a Stage 1 single-arm, pre-post, mixed-methods feasibility trial.
 To further his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher focused on GM addiction
disparities, Dr. Kidd will pursue training in the following 5 areas: (1) advanced epidemiology and biostatistics with
longitudinal and clinical trials data, (2) qualitative research, (3) psychosocial intervention adaptation, (4)
psychotherapy clinical trials, and (5) grant writing. The results of this study will be the first application of the Stage
Model of Behavioral Therapies Research in GM populations and the first evidence-based psychosocial alcohol
treatment for GMs. This approach may also inform clinical treatment research for other GM health disparities.
Overall, this award will ensure Dr. Kidd’s successful transition to an independent clinical investigator studying
prevention and treatment of substance use disorders in GM populations."
10912214,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Northwestern/Nigeria Research Training Program in HIV and Malignancies (NN-HAM) addresses a high
priority NIH research area and significant problem in sub-Saharan Africa because of the widespread HIV
epidemic made worse by the high burden of oncogenic viral co-infections. Antiretroviral therapy programs put
into place by PEPFAR, the Global Fund and others, have resulted in a remarkable decrease in HIV-related
morbidity and mortality; however, the rate of certain malignancies are rising while the HIV population is aging.
Most African medical and research institutions are ill-prepared to confront these emerging challenges. For
over 10 years, University of Jos, University of Lagos, and Northwestern University have successfully
collaborated on several NIH grants focusing on HIV and HIV-associated conditions including cancer. We also
formed a network to successfully complete an NCI-funded U54 (Epigenomic Biomarkers of HIV-Associated
Cancers in Nigeria, 1U54CA221205). This renewal Fogarty HIV Research Training Program for LMICs
proposal will continue to advance Nigerian scientists’ capacity for large population-based HIV-malignancy and
diagnostics research by training scientists focused on cancer molecular epidemiology and clinical investigation.
Our primary hypothesis is that building capacity in molecular cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical
investigation on HIV-associated malignancies will significantly enhance our understanding of cancer
epidemiology and diagnostics to promote mechanistic biomarker-based research that will inform preventive
and therapeutic strategies, ultimately leading to a reduction in cancer incidence and mortality. This renewal
application’s specific aims are to: 1. train cancer molecular epidemiologists and clinical investigators capable
of: i) designing and conducting population-based molecular epidemiology studies; ii) developing protocols for
biospecimen collection, processing, and storage; iii) developing biomarkers that can be used for prevention
and improved treatment of HIV-associated malignancies; and iv) translating biomarker assays into novel point-
of-care (POC) tests for diagnosis and screening of HIV-associated malignancies; 2. train master’s degree-level
scientists in biostatistics, clinical investigation, and epidemiology who can manage and handle data from
clinical, laboratory, and population settings, and perform comprehensive clinical validation and epidemiological
(population-based) studies; 3. create a multidisciplinary research team, led by Nigerian investigators, capable
of performing advanced in-country HIV-associated cancer molecular epidemiology and diagnostics research at

10920486,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer treatment accelerates aging. In people over 65, accelerated aging may have far greater consequences
than in younger adults. One of the most important consequences of accelerated aging is frailty. Frailty is linked
to loss of independence, falls, and death. Older cancer survivors develop frailty 2- to 4-fold more frequently and
at an earlier age than age-matched controls. Mechanisms underlying frailty are just starting to be understood.
One key aging mechanism driving frailty is cellular senescence – a state of terminal growth arrest. Senescence
is the result of both natural aging and cancer treatment; radiation and chemotherapy both generate senescent
cells (Sncs). In pilot biomarker studies, I observed that older survivors treated with chemotherapy (vs. no
chemotherapy) have increased T-cell expression of P16INK4a (p16). p16 is an established marker of Sncs. I also
observed that the percentage of T-cells expressing p16 correlates with clinical frailty. My findings are consistent
with published studies linking p16 and frailty in childhood cancer survivors. Together, these data provide the
premise for testing clinical interventions to target and eliminate Sncs in older survivors. Recently, drugs have
been discovered that selectively eliminate Sncs – senolytics. One such senolytic is fisetin, a natural product
flavonoid found in strawberries and other fruits. Because the amount of fisetin varies considerably in food, it is
not possible to achieve sufficient levels for eliminating Sncs in a natural diet; however, fisetin is available as a
dietary supplement. In preclinical models, fisetin reduces Sncs, inflammation, and frailty. As such, fisetin is now
in >10 efficacy trials to alleviate age-related conditions in frail older adults and, so far, has had a favorable safety
profile. No trial to date has tested fisetin in frail older cancer survivors. Here, I propose a randomized placebo-
controlled trial with multi-modality biomarkers to test the preliminary efficacy, safety, and tolerability of fisetin to
improve frailty and reduce Snc burden in frail older cancer survivors. Guided by a firm mechanistic rationale and
preliminary data, my overall hypothesis is that fisetin is efficacious (improves frailty), safe, and tolerable
in frail older survivors. To test my hypothesis, I will randomize cancer survivors age >65 with diminished gait
speed (<0.8 m/s) to a 60-day course of fisetin vs. placebo. The primary endpoint is change in gait speed from
day 1 to day 60. Secondary endpoints include changes in p16, inflammatory biomarkers, and frailty measures
(Fried’s criteria, frailty index, grip strength). I also will assess safety and tolerability of fisetin and explore longer-
term sustainability of efficacy, as measured by gait speed at 150 days. Promising results from this study will
provide preliminary evidence for a large multi-center clinical trial (R01) to establish the efficacy of fisetin in older
survivors. Additionally, by completing this study, I will fill a gap in my prior training in cancer clinical trials with
training in geroscience research. This study will form the basis of my independent research program to develop
geroprotective interventions to ensure that older cancer survivors live healthy lives well after cancer treatment."
10920375,"Nearly 100 people die every day from a prescription opioid overdose in the United States (US). Over-reliance
on opioids for these with chronic pain is one of the factors that led to this crisis. Pain, both acute and chronic,
that is so severe that it requires opioids to attempt to keep to tolerable levels, is a constant companion to the
100,000 people in the United States, mostly of African or Hispanic background, and millions more worldwide
living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Pain is SCD’s hallmark symptom, and the leading cause for almost
200,000 annual emergency department (ED) admissions, and is the leading cause of hospitalization, with
estimated annual health care costs in the US of $2.4 billion. We will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness
implementation trial to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture and guided relaxation on 360 people with SCD
while observing and gathering information on implementation in three health systems: University of Illinois
Hospital & Health Sciences System, University of Florida Health, and Duke University Health Systems. Each
serves a large population with SCD, uses EPIC as their electronic health record, and has a Clinical and
Translational Science Award (CTSA), which will help speed the translation of discovery into improved patient
care. UG3 1-year Planning Phase: Year 1 comprises milestone-driven planning to prepare the three health
systems for the subsequent pragmatic clinical trial (UH3). During the UH3 Implementation Phase, our 3-arm, 3-
site randomized controlled trial will follow a quantitative SMART design. A pragmatic trial that evaluates
adaptive interventions where our guided relaxation and acupuncture interventions responds to patients’
characteristics and evolving pain status. We rely on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) to plan, execute, and evaluate associated implementation processes. The use of complementary and
integrative (CIH) therapies by those with SCD to reduce pain, opioid use, and enable themselves to better
cope with their pain is well known, but there are few studies that evaluate the effectiveness of these therapies,
and none that also evaluates the implementation across multiple health care systems and patient populations
as this study will."
10922688,"In Phase I, the Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism (AIM) center’s Administrative Core (AC) established 
a nationally unique thematic center focused on autophagy, inflammation, and metabolism. These interlinked 
areas are of fundamental and biomedical value and impact human health, including aging, circulatory 
diseases, cancer, infection, autoimmune disorders, neurodegeneration, obesity, and diabetes. Inflammation 
and metabolism are at the core of national and global health issues, as well as in New Mexico, being driven by 
health disparities, obesity, and aging populations. The AC coordinated all AIM operations and ensured AIM’s 
impact at University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. The AC has overseen AIM’s growth from a local 
to internationally recognized entity and has catalyzed AIM’s demonstrable impact on the scientific field. AIM 
publications have a Weighed Relative Citation Ratio of 356.9 (“highly influential set of articles” per iCite 
definition). All four junior investigators (mentored PIs; mPIs) from the initial cohort graduated by obtaining 
independent R01s. In Phase II, the AC will strengthen the AIM center based on experiences in Phase I and will 
lead AIM’s progress toward sustainability. Strengthening mentoring and support for mPIs and other 
investigators will remain a key focus, with additional approaches implemented to increase mentor skills and 
evaluate mentoring effectiveness. The AC will coordinate its multi-pronged pilot programs with scientific core 
utilization. Additionally, the AC will promote partnerships with other IDeA centers. Sustainability planning began 
in Phase I with a task force, and in Phase II will be under the purview of the sustainability director and a 
sustainability committee. 
The long-term goal of the AC is to lead AIM to become a self-sustained, impactful center. The AC will provide 
programmatic and scientific leadership, evaluation, reporting, approval, and financial oversight. The AC will 
build the next generation of AIM leaders, formalized through extended individual development plans for 
graduating mPIs, customizing their roles as they and the AIM center mature. The AC will foster connections 
with IDeA programs, form an innovative tri-CoBRE council with joint retreats, interact with all stake holders, 
including advisory committees and the NIGMS program, prepare reports, ensure compliance, and align AIM with 
institutional goals, in turn influencing them. The AC specific aims are: 
1. Strengthen success of mPIs and further increase critical mass of AIM investigators. 
2. Augment scientific core capabilities and foster AIM activities leading to sustainability. 
3. Set AIM’s vision, provide management, build the next generation of center leaders, and strengthen 
 AIM’s interactions."
10922690,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is perhaps the most important complication for children with congenital heart
disease (CHD) that results in increased pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and pressure. Postnatally, the presence of
large communications at the level of the ventricles (e.g. ventricular septal defect) or great vessels (e.g. truncus
arteriosus) exposes the pulmonary circulation to abnormal elevations in blood flow and pressure, which results
in progressive structural and functional abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature. Metabolic reprogramming is
increasingly recognized as a critical component of early pulmonary vascular injury and disease. Vascular
morphology studies in our Shunt lamb model demonstrate a >2-fold increase in pulmonary arterioles in Shunt
compared to control lambs. This is opposed to the decrease in arterial counts demonstrated in humans with
advanced disease. This early increase in angiogenesis likely represents an adaptation to the increase in flow
and pressure. The development of a hyperproliferative, anti-apoptotic endothelial phenotype is necessary for this
angiogenic response. Further, it requires a dramatic metabolic reprogramming that serves to supply these cells
with the necessary biosynthetic precursors required for cell division while simultaneously decreasing cellular
ATP levels due to increased consumption and decreased respiration. We have linked this decrease in ATP to
the loss of hsp90-mediated NO signaling and the development of endothelial dysfunction and vascular
remodeling. Thus, this PPG intensely focuses on increasing our understanding of: i) the differential effects of
mechanical forces on cellular metabolic programming; ii) post translational modifications (PTMs) that influence
key signaling pathways involved in metabolic reprogramming; iii) interactions between mitochondrial network
dynamics, metabolism, and cellular survival; iv) how these pathways interact to disrupt hsp90-mediated NO
signaling; and v) novel therapeutic strategies for treating CHD with increased PBF. The key novel pathways that
comprise the focus of each Project were identified by our intensive investigations into the metabolic
reprogramming underlying the development of pulmonary vascular disease and selected for their capacity to
contribute to a spectrum of cellular responses related to glutaminolysis and aerobic glycolysis (Project #1),
cellular ß-oxidation and mitochondrial bioenergetics (Project #2), mitochondrial network dynamics and
mitophagy (Project #3), and cell proliferation and apoptosis (Projects #1 & #3). Investigations are integrated
across our three PPG projects to fully understand how metabolic reprogramming leads to the loss of hsp90-
mediated NO signaling and represents the thematic underpinning of this PPG. The synergy derived from the
interactions between individual Projects and scientific Cores, with our programmatic approaches, will promote
an increased understanding of how mechanical forces modify cell metabolism, NO signaling and endothelial
function, and the development of novel, individualized therapies to attenuate pulmonary vascular disease in
children born with CHD that result in increased PBF and pressure."
10922692,"The Autophagy, Inflammation, and Metabolism (AIM) center Scientific Core (ASC) provides
state of the art technology with high content microscopy as its centerpiece, expert services,
training to mentored PIs (mPIs) and other AIM members and users in general, in support of
fundamental and disease-related studies of autophagy, inflammation and metabolism. In Phase
I, the ASC played a crucial role in mPIs competing for independent funding, with all mPIs in the
initial cohort obtaining their R01s and graduating with full success. The ASC developed a
significant interdisciplinary user base thematically related to AIM’s continuum of research,
leading to impactful publications, collaborations, grants including multiple funded R01s, and
other significant projects. The ASC has expanded the impact of the AIM Center at the University
of New Mexico Health Science Center (UNM HSC), in our state, nationally, and worldwide.
In Phase II, the ASC will further strengthen the research impact of the AIM Center and
contribute to its pillars of sustainability, which include ASC’s own sustainability, critical mass of
investigators, institutional support, and programmatic grants. The first major goal of the ASC in
Phase II is to provide key instrumentation and technical expertise to Phase II mPIs, enabling
their graduation. A second goal is to build research capacity related to autophagy, inflammation,
and metabolism, and to build a critical mass of funded investigators at all career levels to
sustain future core facility operations and contribute to the sustainability of the center as a
whole. The ASC will offer expert advice to educate and assist users with the latest technologies.
ASC will acquire, update, and develop equipment and assays after receiving feedback from
mPIs, AIM-affiliated users, and internal and external advisory committee members to maximize
the ASC’s capabilities. Central to the overall success of the AIM Center, the ASC will facilitate
interdisciplinary research performed by mPIs and all AIM Center investigators. The ASC will
accomplish its goals through the following specific aims:
1. Enable Phase II mPIs to study autophagy, metabolism and inflammation.
2. Support and expand the user base by providing expert service, training, collaboration, and
dissemination of new technologies, focused on building a critical mass of researchers.
3. Build a path to long-term sustainability through the development of a fee structure and
outreach to new users within the institution, state, and region."
10922701,"SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic and millions of deaths worldwide. Although vaccines were developed in record time, the natural cycle of immunity is short and the rise of new variants complicates the development of herd immunity. New drugs have been proposed as antivirals however, it is known that viruses also develop drug resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to find new therapeutic targets to cope with SARS-CoV-2 and new zoonotic coronaviruses to prevent new pandemics and another global health crisis. In this regard, a proven therapeutic target that is understudied is the inhibition of viral capping, a process that modifies the 5’UTR of the viral RNA to mimic the mammalian RNA. Capping prevents the degradation of viral RNA, improves translation, and prevents the detection of the innate cell immune system. Viral replication and capping take place in confined double-membrane vesicles (DMV) formed by host membranes and viral non-structural proteins (nsps). These processes cause severe stress and imbalance in the metabolism and bioenergetics of the host cell since high amounts of ATP and S-adenosylmethionine are used. Many metabolic pathways improve their efficiency by forming protein complexes, which avoid product inhibition and move the equilibrium of the reaction to the product. The replication-transcriptional (RTC) complex of SARS-CoV-2 was previously described; however little is known about the capping enzymes (nsp14-nsp10, nsp16-nsp10). Since capping enzymes are methyl transferases (MTases), which are strongly inhibited by the product of the reaction S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and this product can only be hydrolyzed by a host SAH-hydrolase (AHCY), the need for host metabolites such as ATP, GTP,SAM and SAH hydrolysis, indicates a possible viral-host hybrid metabolon which is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the existence of a hybrid viral-capping-host metabolic pool within the DMVs and the impact of these changes on the bioenergetics of the host. To address these knowledge gaps, we will take an integrated strategy using computational, biochemical, structural, and cell biology approaches. The aims of the proposal are: 1. Determine the existence of a viral methyltransferases-SAH hydrolase metabolon. Using AlphaFold 2 multimer software as a computational approach to predict the interactions of the methyl transferases nsp14-nsp16-nsp10 and nsp14, nsp16, nsp10 with AHCY. In parallel, these interactions will be tested by pull-down assays, using purified proteins and structural biology. Aim 2. Establish the localization of the methyltransferases from coronaviruses and S-adenosylmethionine hydrolase within the DMVs. The co-localization of capping enzymes nsp14, nsp16, and AHCY hydrolase within viral vesicles will be assessed by a time-course of MHV infection using lung-rat epithelial cells (L2), followed by subcellular fractionation, Co-immunoprecipitation as well as confocal microscopy using immunofluorescence. Aim 3. Assess the changes in the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation of the host upon viral replication and capping. The rate of external acidification (glycolysis-lactate production) and the rate of oxygen consumption (mitochondrial activity) will be measured in L2-MHV-infected cells using a seahorse analyzer. And the interaction of the glycolytic enzymes and mitochondria with SAM-metabolic enzymes and viral proteins in the DMV, will be tested as in aim 2."

We request partial support to cover the expenses of the 15th Mechanics of Hearing (MoH) Workshop, to be held at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI in June 2024. Since their inception in 1983, the Mechanics of Hearing Workshops
have provided the primary forum for presenting, debating, and sparking advances in the fields of auditory biomechanics and
biophysics. Convened at three-year intervals, the Workshops bring together researchers working on the mechanics of
hearing for nearly a week of intense discussion. The Workshop will create bridges between numerous scientific fields and
approaches by covering auditory biophysics at the molecular, cellular and system levels with both experimental and
theoretical approaches and aims to advance our understanding of the mechanics of hearing. As it has in the past, this
Workshop seeks to offer an invaluable opportunity to graduate and post-doctoral trainees to discuss their work, develop
new ideas, interface directly with more senior scientists, and absorb the practice and sociology of science. The intentional
opportunity for formal and informal interaction between junior and more senior investigators is a memorable hallmark of this
Workshop. Attendees are from a wide range of U.S. and international institutions, and the Workshop has historically been
held at both domestic and international locations. The most recent Workshop was held in Denmark. Prior to that, Workshops
were held in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Greece, Canada, and the United States. The University
of Michigan was chosen because of its central location (allowing easy travel for the majority of the participants), outstanding
conference facilities and support services, idyllic campus/surroundings, and very reasonable costs. In this proposal, we
request funds from the NIH to cover student and post-doctoral travel awards, travel of invited speakers, and a portion of the
audio-visual costs (including CART/captioning services)."
10908291,"Nerve agents are lethal chemical weapons that have been used in war and terrorist attacks, with devastating
consequences. The risk for mass exposure to nerve agents is presently very high. One of the clinical
manifestations of acute exposure to nerve agents is seizure activity progressing to status epilepticus (SE),
which can lead to death, or brain damage. It is imperative that medical countermeasures against the toxic
effects of nerve agents are developed and become available, which will not only save lives, but also protect
against brain damage caused by prolonged SE, and the ensuing long-term morbidities. Currently, diazepam
(DZP) is the FDA-approved anticonvulsant for the treatment of nerve agent-induced SE, and its replacement
by midazolam (MDZ) is under consideration. There is ample evidence, however, indicating that neither
benzodiazepine has satisfactory antiseizure and neuroprotective efficacy. Therefore, a more efficacious
therapy is needed to replace DZP and MDZ. We have already completed a significant amount of research in
soman-exposed rats, demonstrating that an AMPA/GluK1 receptor antagonist, LY293558 (tezampanel), exerts
a far superior antiseizure and neuroprotective efficacy in comparison with DZP or MDZ. However, we also
found that 6 months after exposure (a long time for the life span of a rat), even LY293558-treated rats
presented evidence of brain damage, suggesting a progressive nature of the induced neuropathology, and
indicating the importance of long-term studies in evaluating the neuroprotective efficacy of an anticonvulsant.
Therefore, to enhance neuroprotective efficacy, we subsequently tested the combination of LY293558 with an
NMDA receptor antagonist—we used caramiphen, an antimuscarinic with NMDA receptor antagonistic
properties—and found complete protection against brain damage up to 6 months after soman exposure. Most
of these studies have been conducted in young rats (postnatal day 21 or 12). The goal of the present
application is to test LY293558+caramiphen in adult male and female rats, in order to complete all the
preclinical research necessary to lead this highly efficacious combination therapy to the stage of advanced
development. We will include aged rats in the proposed studies, in order to obtain preclinical data pertinent to
the elderly population, which is more difficult to protect. Comparisons will be made with soman-exposed rats
treated with MDZ. The anticonvulsants will be administered at 1 h after soman exposure in order to simulate a
real case scenario of mass exposure, when medical care is unlikely to available immediately. Our central
hypothesis is that LY293558+caramiphen will prove to be far superior to MDZ in controlling soman-induced
seizures, preventing neuronal degeneration, neuronal loss, GABAergic interneuronal loss, atrophy and
pathophysiological alterations in the amygdala and hippocampus, overall brain pathology as revealed by MRI,
as well as neurological (development of spontaneous recurrent seizures – epileptogenesis) and behavioral
(increased anxiety-like behavior) abnormalities, studied up to 6 months postexposure."
10908388,"Project Summary
Most children in foster care experience multiple forms of maltreatment, increasing risk for behavior problems
(e.g., aggression, noncompliance, suspensions/expulsions from preschool or daycare). The foster care system
is over-burdened and crisis-response oriented, limiting capacity to focus on prevention of behavior problems
with foster caregivers and children. The Chicago Parent Program (CPP) is an evidence-based 12-session
program (11 concurrent weeks, 1 one-month booster) with demonstrated significant and sustained
improvements in consistent discipline, parenting self-efficacy, and child behavior problems 1 year following
training. If available to foster caregivers, CPP could prevent or reduce behavior problems in foster youth,
decrease caregiver stress, increase self-efficacy and consistent discipline with caregivers, and prevent
unnecessary placement changes. However, adaptations to the existing program are necessary. The goal of
this study is to conduct a clinical trial of CPP adapted for foster caregivers of young children. This will be
accomplished through three aims: Aim 1: Adapt CPP to meet the unique needs of children ages 2-5 years
who are placed with foster caregivers (CPP-FC) and pilot delivery coordinated with mandated
healthcare visits (2 groups, 6-8 families). CPP content will be adapted (e.g., additional content targeting
trauma and child maltreatment, modified discussion of vignettes, additional role-play targeting specific foster
care scenarios). A stakeholder adaptation team, including 6 caregivers, has been established to guide
development of enhanced content. Aim 2: Assess the impact of CPP-FC on caregiver stress & confidence
in managing child behavior. Families (N = 300) will be randomized to CPP-FC or usual care, with
assessments at baseline, 3 months (end of training) and 6 months. CPP-FC is expected to reduce caregiver
stress and increase confidence. Aim 3: Assess the impact of CPP-FC on child behavior. Observations of
structured interactions between caregivers and children at baseline and 3-months will be collected along with
caregiver reports of child behaviors at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. CPP-FC is expected to decrease
child behavior problems and result in fewer placement changes. If hypotheses are confirmed, this study will
provide an evidence-based model to prevent behavior problems in young foster children that could be spread
to other institutions."
10908561,"Summary
Advanced sequencing technologies provide ever-increasing quantities of data about human genetic variation
and viral evolution. However, predicting the outcomes of missense mutations in protein coding regions remains
a challenge, creating a bottleneck in discriminating biomedically-relevant variants from neutral ones (with little or
no effect on phenotype). In particular, outcome predictions are very poor when a missense mutation alters amino
acids that are located far from a protein’s functional/binding sites. These shortcomings also impair protein
design. We propose to ameliorate these needs by developing quantitative, computational models that predict
the effects of long-distance substitutions on binding interactions. To that end, we have developed an approach
in which (1) a protein’s collective motions are first revealed by molecular dynamics simulations and then (2) force
perturbation is used to disrupt the protein’s equilibrium, thereby approximating the effects of ligand binding. We
have used this approach in published studies and preliminary data to illuminate the propagation of dynamical
changes through a protein’s anisotropic network of interactions. Results suggest that changes in these dynamic
networks have crucial effects on protein function, thereby leading to our central hypothesis: The effects of long-
distance substitutions on ligand binding are emergent properties of changes in the protein’s dynamically-coupled,
anisotropic network. The goal of the current proposal is to extend this computational approach to develop
models that predict: (Aim 1) the magnitudes of binding affinity changes arising from long-distance, modulating
substitutions; (Aim 2) which pairs of non-contact substitutions have non-additive effects on binding affinities
(“epistasis”); and (Aim 3) which long-distance positions contribute to ligand specificity. To that end, we have a
well-established collaboration that allows us to iterate between computational predictions and experimental
testing, enabling development of quantitative models with computed accuracies. Our preliminary studies used
the well-characterized E. coli lactose repressor protein (LacI), for which experimental results validate our
preliminary computational models and provide specific hypotheses for Aims 1-3. Additional model proteins will
be used to show the generality of our approach and will include the LacI homolog PurR, the cAMP receptor
protein, and a viral protease SARS-Cov2-Mpro. Results will be used to provide novel computational tools for
predicting functional outcomes of long-distance substitutions. The success of this project will catalyze research
at the interface of protein structural biology, molecular genetics, evolution and medicine by advancing the
mechanistic understanding of how substitutions distal from functional sites alter ligand binding."

Genetic susceptibility contributes significantly to the development of diabetes and its complications. Recent
successes in genome wide association and exome sequencing have demonstrated that the technological
capability now exists to identify many of the genes responsible for complex disorders. To be successful in such
endeavors, it is necessary to combine expertise in genetic epidemiology, clinical investigation, molecular
genotyping, DNA sequencing, and mathematical genetic analysis. The goal of the Human Genetics Core is to
offer such expertise to DRC investigators conducting genetic studies. To achieve this objective, the Human
Genetics Core will: a) Assist DRC investigators in the development and successful completion of well-designed
genetic studies; b) Establish and store EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), as well as PAXgene
tubes; c) Provide access to molecular methodology for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and
specialized (e.g., the exome chip), candidate gene sequencing, whole exome sequencing (WES), whole
genome sequencing (WGS), and large-scale gene methylation analysis (by chip); d) Assist with mathematical
genetic epidemiologic analysis, including analysis of multi-omics data; e) Make induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs), as well as diabetes-relevant cells derived from them, available to investigators as a means of
investigating the impact of specific genetic variants on organ development and tissue function; f) Provide
training in genetic techniques to DRC investigators and staff; g) Provide access to DRC investigators to a
national multi-ethnic (including high-risk minorities) genomics resource for the study of diabetes and diabetes-
related phenotypes. In the last cycle, the Human Genetics Core brought GWAS technology to DRC
investigators and in this cycle extends the technology available for studying human samples with the addition
of specialized genotyping chips, methylation chips, exome and whole genome sequencing, and iPSC
technology. The DRC offers a unique opportunity to facilitate research directed at identifying and characterizing
the genes responsible for diabetes and related disorders, including both macrovascular and microvascular
complications, by providing access to both the expertise and facilities necessary for such genetic research in
human populations. In the last cycle, the Human Genetics Core augmented GWAS technology by offering
specialized genotyping chips to DRC investigators as well as iPSC technology. In this cycle, the Core will
expand the available technologies, including several new specialized genotyping chips (e.g., GSA, 850K
methylation), next generation sequencing, and diabetes-relevant tissues derived from iPSCs, complemented
by updated multi-omic analysis methods. The DRC facilitates research directed at identifying and
characterizing the genes responsible for diabetes and related disorders by providing access to both the
expertise and facilities necessary for such genetic research in human populations."
10909259,"Abstract - Pilot and Feasibility Program
The mission of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program is to foster the development of new investigators and to
provide seed support for innovative high-risk diabetes-related research. Dr. Peter Tontonoz assumed the
directorship in 2014 and will continue to lead the P&F program in the next cycle. The UCSD/UCLA DRC has
an exemplary track record of funding catalytic diabetes research. In the history of our DRC, the P&F Program
has funded 82 projects (61 over the last 10 years). Over 90% of these were projects from young investigators
looking to establish new independent diabetes research programs. More than 95% of our P&F recipients are
still active in diabetes research, providing clear evidence that we are selecting meritorious recipients.
Moreover, our P&F-funded investigators have an impressive record of obtaining post-P&F NIH grant support
and of publications in high impact journals. Most importantly, many prior UCSD/UCLA DRC P&F awardees are
now independent, productive R01-funded faculty members at UCSD/UCLA or at other institutions around the
US. Collectively, these achievements underscore the exceptional pipeline of young investigators in our
research community and our ability to successfully identify meritorious recipients. Specific Objectives for the
P&F Program are to continue to: 1. Promote emerging and innovative diabetes projects and catalyze
development of future scientific leaders; 2. Inform and engage diabetes research communities regarding the
DRC P&F and its opportunities; 3. Mentor P&F recipients in order to facilitate and accelerate their transition to
independent external funding; 4. Leverage institutional investments in the form of matching support,
infrastructure outlays, and the development of technologies towards the success of P&F projects; 5. Synergize
with other institutional training and research programs; 6. Foster collaborative research among junior and
senior scientists, promote leadership skills, and encourage entrepreneurship and the development of
intellectual property; 7. Implement oversight and programmatic review of the P&F program and its awardees"
10914230,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are hallmarks of mammalian aging and disease.
Nε-carboxyethyl-lysine (CEL) in particular, is among the most abundant AGEs accumulating in tissue proteins
with aging, and is an important marker of glycation, oxidative stress, and disease. Current techniques for
reliable measurement of CEL are slow, expensive (>$120/sample), and not readily available to many academic
research labs nor easily applied for routine analysis of clinical samples. Development of a convenient method
for measurement of CEL would democratize the research tools used to study AGEs and advance the tools
available to study and treat diseases at the interface of aging, glycation and oxidative stres.
Revel has discovered a CEL oxidase enzyme which oxidizes CEL to lysine. The newly discovered CEL
oxidase provides an opportunity to develop enzymes for diagnostic use in monitoring CEL-modifications. The
goal of this Phase I SBIR is to develop a rapid, one-pot, inexpensive enzymatic test (<$10/sample) to measure
CEL. The proposed assay will be developed analogous to the enzymatic HbA1c test which is used to assess
patient blood sugar levels and diagnose diabetes. In Phase II, we will develop a workflow for CEL detection in
patient samples. Eventually, further engineering of the enzyme for removal of CEL from endogenous proteins
could yield a ground-breaking tool for reversing glycoxidatively damaged proteins in clinical medicine."

Weight-related problems are of great public health concern given their high prevalence, health consequences,
and unequal distribution across ethnic/racial backgrounds and income levels. The Healthy Weight Promotion in
Youth and Families from Diverse Communities Applied Epidemiology Training Program is designed to train
future scientists for successful research careers aimed at ensuring positive weight-related health
among youth and families from diverse communities. This program is unique in its combined focus on five
areas: 1) comprehensively addressing the broad spectrum of weight-related problems, including obesity, poor
dietary intake, low physical activity, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating; 2) promoting positive weight-
related health among children and families during critical periods of the life course; 3) achieving greater health
equity by reducing disparities in weight-related problems across ethnic/racial and income levels; 4) engaging in
both observational epidemiologic population-based studies and intervention/evaluation research (clinical,
community, and policy-oriented); and 5) translating research into action within different settings. This program
is designed to provide rigorous, innovative, and pragmatic research training. As a new program, the number of
trainees will gradually increase: Year 1: 3 trainees (1 predoc and 2 postdoc); Year 2: 5 trainees (2 predoc and
3 postdoc); Years 3-5: 7 trainees (3 predoc and 4 postdoc). Predoctoral trainees will be funded for up to four
years and will complete a PhD in Social and Behavioral Epidemiology. Postdoctoral trainees will be funded for
up to three years. Training will promote interdisciplinary learning, collaborative experiences, innovative
thinking, rigorous research skills, and leadership capacity to ensure successful and impactful research careers.
Training includes: 1) individualized mentoring by experienced interdisciplinary faculty; 2) experiential learning
through active involvement in observational and intervention research projects; 3) interdisciplinary professional
training for leadership development; 4) formal class work; 5) peer group work; 6) deep dive workshops

10917264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Hypertension (HTN) control in Blacks is sub-optimal due to barriers at
the patient, health systems, provider, and community-levels of care. Although the efficacy of nurse case
management (NCM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is well-proven; these strategies do not
address community-level barriers (unstable housing, transportation) to adequate HTN control, thus limiting
their impact in Blacks. Integration of community health worker (CHWs) into primary care to help patients
navigate community resources is effective for HTN control in patients experiencing community-level barriers.
Despite their efficacy, implementation of these multi-level evidence-based interventions (NCM, HBPM, and
use of CHWs) into routine care in real world primary care practices, where a majority of minority patients
receive care, is suboptimal. This proposal harnesses practice facilitation (PF)- a theoretically sound and
sustainable implementation strategy to evaluate the implementation of NCM, HBPM, and CHWs delivered as
an integrated community-clinic linkage model [Practice support And Community Engagement (PACE)] to
address patient-, physician-, health system-, and community-level barriers to HTN control in Blacks. We will
test the implementation of PACE across a network of 20 primary practices within NYU Langone Health in
NYC, in partnership with an established Community-Clinic-Academic Advisory Board and HealthFirst (NYC's
largest Medicaid payer). Practice facilitators will assist practices to integrate NCM and HBPM into the clinic
workflow for 6 months, after which the patients' BP control status are re-evaluated; and for those who remain
uncontrolled, the facilitators will assist practices to develop processes for the addition of a CHW to the care
team to help patients navigate community resources and address community-level barriers to optimal HTN
control. NCM comprises home BP telemonitoring, behavioral counseling, and medication adjustment/titration
by trained Nurses. Trained CHWs work in partnership with Nurses to enhance care coordination, and provide
health coaching and bi-directional referrals between the practices and community resources. We will conduct
the proposed study in two phases: 1) a UG3 phase that will use principles of Community-Based Participatory
Research and the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research to develop a context-specific PF
strategy and; 2) a UH3 implementation phase that will use Proctor's Implementation Outcomes Framework to
evaluate, in a stepped-wedge cluster RCT of 20 primary care practices in 500 Black patients with uncontrolled
HTN, the effect of the PF strategy on clinical and cost-effectiveness of PACE. We will also examine adoption
and implementation fidelity as potential mechanisms that may explain the impact of PF on BP control. Primary
outcome is BP control from baseline to 18 months. Secondary outcome is cost-effectiveness of PACE. The
study's findings will provide a practical and sustainable system that harnesses existing clinical and community
resources to build capacity for primary care practices to manage HTN control in minority populations."
10917143,"Breast cancer has a strong heritable component with approximately 15% of patients exhibiting a family history
of the disease. My group recently established that inherited variants in 12 genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2,
CDH1, CHEK2, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53) predispose to breast cancer (1, 2), that
variants in all 12 genes increase risks of breast cancer in minority populations (3), and that variants in certain
genes predispose only to estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ATM and CHEK2) or ER negative and triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC) (BARD1, RAD51C and RAD51D) (4-6). Despite these major advances, clinical application
of the information is still lacking. In addition, up to 50% of the familial risk of breast cancer remains unexplained.
Under this award we plan to address clinically relevant issues, including improved application of genetic testing
results for risk management of patients and improved selection of breast cancer therapy. In addition, we aim to
identify new breast cancer predisposition genes that account for the missing heritability. The proposed studies
are unified under a theme of advancing understanding of predisposition genetics. The studies are as follows:
A. Age-specific and population-specific cancer risk assessment for predisposition gene variants. Results from
hereditary multigene panel testing has limited clinical utility because only lifetime risk estimates of cancer by age
80 are available. Here we will estimate 5 and 10-year risks of breast cancer, so that patients can make decisions
about medical management. In addition, we have evidence that specific genes have much higher penetrance in
African Americans. We will determine the penetrance of predisposition gene variants using a large African
American cohort study in order to modify risk management guidelines for this population.
B. Functional characterization of predisposition gene variants. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)
identified by genetic testing remain a major problem for individuals receiving clinical genetic testing. We aim to
combine high-throughput functional analysis of VUS in ATM, BRCA2 and PALB2 genes with genetic data from
families in integrated models to determine the clinical relevance of many VUS alterations.
C. Therapeutic response for breast cancer predisposition genes. The responsiveness of breast tumors
associated with predisposition gene variants to standard or targeted therapy is only known for BRCA1 and
BRCA2 mutation carriers. Here we aim to identify all patients with pathogenic variants in the commonly mutated
BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 genes from a series of neo-adjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic breast
cancer clinical trials and to assess response to therapy and outcome.
D. Identification of novel breast cancer predisposition alleles. The common and rare risk alleles for breast
cancer account for only 50% of the familial risk in the population. In an effort to identify the missing heritability
we will collaborate with Regeneron Inc. through our SIMPLEXO consortium to identify common and rare alleles
associated with breast cancer risk in 45,000 breast cancer patients."
10917147,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer incidence and mortality in women in Nigeria.
Survival is poor, in part due to inadequate access to effective treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) Harmonized Guidelines for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) were developed to promote delivery of
evidence-based, context-appropriate breast cancer care. Dr. Romanoff’s prior work shows that receiving multi-
disciplinary, guideline-concordant breast cancer care in Nigeria is associated with improved outcomes.
Nonetheless, guideline implementation and adherence are sporadic and have not been systematically evaluated.
The overall goal of this K08 proposal is to facilitate Dr. Romanoff’s development into an independent investigator
in global oncology, focusing on strategies to enhance evidence-based breast cancer care delivery in resource-
limited settings. This research aims to develop and evaluate strategies to improve healthcare provider adherence
to clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer care in Nigeria. Candidate: Dr. Romanoff is a Breast Surgical
Oncologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, where she is an Assistant Professor in the Department
of Global Health and Health System Design, as well as a Global Cancer Disparities Researcher at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Aims for candidate development include education and training in: 1)
fundamentals of health services research, 2) implementation science, and 3) global breast oncology. With the
candidate development and research activities proposed, Dr. Romanoff will develop the tools necessary to
become an independent investigator and leader in the field of global oncology, and meet her ultimate goal of
improving breast cancer outcomes in resource-limited settings worldwide. Research: This research will use
rigorous implementation science frameworks and methodologies to accelerate adherence to the NCCN
Harmonized Guidelines for SSA in Nigeria, with the ultimate goal of reducing the evidence-to-practice gap and
improving evidence-based breast cancer treatment. To achieve this, Dr. Romanoff will leverage the research
infrastructure of the African Research Group for Oncology (ARGO), a research consortium including MSK and
26 Nigerian academic institutions. The overall hypothesis is that implementation of structured, multi-level
strategies to enhance adherence to breast cancer care guidelines in Nigeria will be acceptable, appropriate,
feasible and adoptable – and show promise to change clinical practice. Study aims are to: 1) identify multi-level
barriers to guideline-concordant breast cancer care in Nigeria, 2) develop evidence-based implementation
strategies to improve adherence to breast cancer clinical practice guidelines in Nigeria, and 3) rigorously
evaluate selected implementation strategies in a pilot study in Nigeria. The rationale that underlies this proposal
is that implementation of context-appropriate strategies to promote guideline adherence will improve breast
cancer care delivery in Nigeria, and ultimately patient survival."
10917287,"Project Summary and Abstract
Gene therapy enables the treatment of a large number of genetic diseases through delivery of nucleic acids striking at the
root of the disease. This is advantageous because it is highly modular, allowing for a number of different cargo nucleic
acids to be delivered depending on the disease cause. As such, the ideal gene therapy delivery vector would be able to
carry a variety of cargo, deliver this in a targeted manner, and accommodate a range of cargo sizes. There are a number of
techniques utilized to deliver nucleic acids including viral systems like adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), and
lentivirus, as well as non-viral methods including nanoparticles. Although these therapies can be successful, a key
limitation to currently used vectors is the immune response which can lead to ineffective delivery of nucleic acid cargo.
There is currently a need to develop effective and non-immunogenic delivery vehicles for gene therapy for a wide range of
diseases, including neurological disease, for which effective delivery vehicles have yet to be designed.
To this end, mammalian genomes contain numerous virus-like genes, some of which have been co-opted by their host
cells for important functions. Among these are homologs of gag, which encodes the capsid protein. We hypothesize that
endogenous genes encoding a capsid domain have the ability to self-assemble into capsids and mediate intercellular
communication by binding, secreting, and delivering nucleic acid cargos. We propose to explore and re-engineer
endogenous capsid-containing proteins for use as gene therapy vectors. We hypothesize that delivery vehicles composed
entirely of self proteins will be more effective than standard vectors as they could be non-immunogenic. Here we propose
to use an approach combining in vitro characterization, re-engineering, and in vitro and in vivo validation to identify
candidate proteins and learn how they can be re-engineered. These systems will ideally be modular, having both
programmable cargo and tropism to treat a range of diseases. We hope that by identifying and re-engineering these
systems, the resulting fully endogenous delivery vehicle will be useful for efficient, reprogrammable, and
non-immunogenic gene delivery.
With the goal of becoming an independent investigator, this project will also support development of computational
biology skills, molecular biology expertise as well as mentorship and scientific communication skills. These will be
supported by the excellent research environment at the Broad Institute and MIT."
10917149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) communities are experiencing a disproportionate share of SARS-
CoV-2 infection and its sequelae in the US. As of September 2021, ANAI people had a cumulative incidence of
9,256 COVID-19 cases per 100,000, compared with 5,445 among non-Hispanic Whites. The current rate of
COVID-19 associated deaths per 100,000 population is 220 among ANAI people, compared with 137 among
non-Hispanic Whites. Widespread vaccination remains the best strategy to control COVID-19 morbidity and
mortality, but the US has one of the lowest vaccine acceptance rates in the world with wide regional variability.
Little research has attempted to understand or address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination in ANAI people,
despite unique geographical, historical, and cultural factors that could influence vaccine uptake in this
population. We have formed a consortium of Tribal health leaders from across Alaska to better understand
vaccine attitudes and intentions, including hesitancy, and to increase vaccine uptake in Alaskan ANAI
communities. In conjunction with community advisors, we will develop and implement a theory-driven
intervention that is grounded in ANAI values of relationality and respect. First, we will use vaccination tracking
data to assess current rates of vaccine uptake and analyze preexisting quantitative and qualitative data
regarding vaccine attitudes, intentions, and behavior among ANAI people in rural and urban areas of Alaska.
We will also conduct a survey in southcentral Alaska to inform intervention design. Second, we will work with
statewide Tribal health leaders and regional Community Advisory Boards to create educational information,
stories, and messages keyed to the beliefs and perceived norms that drive vaccine behavior. This content will
be incorporated into an eHealth toolkit for use by community members and specially trained community
vaccine advocates, laypeople who volunteer to provide information and motivational/emotional support to their
friends, families, and communities. Third, we will launch the intervention in the southcentral region of Alaska
and evaluate effectiveness using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-
AIM) framework. Refinements based on program data and participant feedback will be made, then the refined
intervention will be deployed in two rural regions of Alaska and evaluated. This project will add to the limited
evidence base regarding adult vaccine attitudes, intentions, and behaviors among ANAI people. It holds the
potential to increase vaccination in a hard-hit population and build support for future vaccination as
SARS-CoV2 continues to evolve. Our findings will have broader applicability to vaccine outreach and
engaging ANAI communities in leveraging peer relationships, their social networks, and eHealth to promote
health education and behavior change."
10917325,"Human B cells play a fundamental role in the adaptive immune response to infection, development of protective
immunity from vaccination, and pathology of many autoimmune diseases. Central to all of these processes are
migration of B cells among different tissues and differentiation of B cells into functional subtypes. Currently,
understanding B cell migration and differentiation is limited because these processes are dynamic and difficult
to directly observe, particularly in humans. Our previous work has demonstrated that it is possible to detect
migration and differentiation events along evolutionary trees inferred from B cell receptor (BCR) sequences,
which are subject to rapid somatic hypermutation and antigen-driven selection during adaptive immune
responses. This is analogous to viral phylogeography, the use of evolutionary trees to track the spread of viruses
during epidemics. However, there are key differences in the biology of B cells and viruses that require modifying
and extending existing approaches to make them appropriate for B cells.
 The goal of this proposal is to enable B cell phylogeography. We will develop novel computational
methods that leverage recent advances in single B cell sequencing technology to infer how B cells migrate
between tissues and differentiate into cellular subtypes based on their activation states during immune
responses. The aims of this proposal focus on solving the roadblocks to the development of phylogeographic
methods for B cells. These methods will be validated by simulations and experimental analysis. We will work
with established experimental collaborators to translate these novel methods into meaningful outcomes in the
research of influenza vaccine response and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including lupus and
myasthenia gravis. We will implement these methods in widely available free software, which will greatly increase
their potential to inform vaccination strategies against other pathogens like HIV and SARS-CoV-2, as well as
treatment of other B cell-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis and asthma.
 The K99 phase of this proposal will be guided by Prof. Steven Kleinstein at Yale School of Medicine, a
world leader in computational methods development for BCR sequence analysis, and Prof. Kevin O’Connor, a
leading experimental biologist in the B cell pathology of neurologic autoimmune diseases. The candidate, Dr.
Kenneth Hoehn, has a strong background in genetics and evolutionary biology, and has an established record
of developing evolutionary models to study B cell populations from BCR sequence data. The work detailed in
this proposal will fill gaps in the candidate’s training in B cell biology, single cell analysis, and software
development. The R00 phase will build off of this work to develop a highly generalizable framework for
characterizing the complex migration and differentiation patterns that underlie B cells’ role in vaccination and
autoimmunity. This will support new, medically-relevant discoveries about B cell biology, and serve as a
foundation for the candidate’s future as an independent computational immunologist."
10917127,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Acute kidney injury and brain injury manifest as delirium each affect over 25% of the 500,000 patients
undergoing cardiac surgery annually, and these organ injuries are associated with longer hospitalization,
increased mortality, longer mechanical ventilation, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
Vascular reactivity is a component of vascular function which enables control of tissue perfusion via smooth
muscle tone. Vascular reactivity is elicited via endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling which may be
disrupted by inflammation, surgery, and oxidative stress. The endothelium is a major regulator of vascular
reactivity, coagulation, and immune cell activation, and endothelial dysfunction may contribute to organ
dysfunction after surgery. We have recently identified that impaired vascular reactivity is independently
associated with kidney injury after surgery. Under normal circumstances, nitric oxide diffuses from the
endothelium to vascular smooth muscle and binds to the heme-moiety on soluble guanylyl cyclase inducing a
conformational change that allows the enzyme to catalyze the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.
Oxidation of the iron in this heme moiety to the ferric state, however, impairs nitric oxide binding and vascular
reactivity. Impaired vascular reactivity secondary to impaired soluble guanylyl cyclase activation may be an
important mechanism underlying perioperative organ injury that is not routinely addressed in clinical care.
 Recently, pharmacologic soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulators have been developed to enhance
impaired soluble guanylyl cyclase activation and are approved for use in patients with heart failure and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. These drugs stabilize the heme moiety on soluble guanylyl cyclase while
binding to the enzyme at a separate site, and they directly stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase to generate cyclic
guanosine monophosphate. This project builds on our prior findings that identified impaired vascular reactivity
as a potential mechanism for perioperative organ injury, and further examines the role of the soluble guanylyl
cyclase stimulator vericiguat in enhancing vascular reactivity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and at risk
of organ injury. We hypothesize that administration of a soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulator prior to surgery will
enhance perioperative vascular reactivity and decrease cellular markers of renal tubule and neuronal injury.
We will directly assess vascular reactivity in vivo and ex vivo using gold standard techniques in patients
randomized to receive vericiguat versus placebo and will compare plasma and urine biomarkers of soluble
guanylyl cyclase stimulation, endothelial activation, endothelial barrier degradation, renal tubular injury, and
neuronal injury."

 Dr. Kim is enrolled in a uniquely combined periodontics and Doctor of Science in Dentistry (DScD)
program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine. Under the mentorship of Dr. Boesze-
Battaglia and support from consultants, Dr. Kim will investigate cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) mediated
modulation of phagocytic function. This topic is important in the field of periodontology as it will advance our
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism by Cdt produced by A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)
modulates local host defense regarding localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP). Dr. Kim is committed to a career
in academics, which will be greatly enhanced by the educational, technical and career development training
opportunities afforded by the K08 Award. The established specialty/DScD program at Penn will serve as an
important stepping stone for Dr. Kim's long-term goal to eventually emerge as an independent researcher
studying the pathophysiological mechanism of bacterial and host immune response in an effort to develop
adjunctive/alternative therapeutics for periodontitis.
 Among many possible bacteria that can cause periodontitis, Aa was known as the etiology for LAP. Our
current understanding is that Aa is a critical pathogen providing a suitable environment for other pathogens and
cause LAP. Among different types of toxins produced by Aa, Dr. Kim's project focus on Cdt produced by Aa
which causes cell cycle arrest, apoptosis in T cells and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages
by phosphoinositide 3-kinases blockade. Cdt acts as a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase and
causes phosphatidylinositol (PI) pool imbalance which is crucial for not only the cellular response but phagosome
degradation. Dr. Kim's overarching hypothesis is that Aa Cdt-mediated disruption in macrophage phagosome
processing leads to Aa survival contributing to disruption of local host defense. In Aim1, Dr. Kim will investigate
phagosome maturation with effector proteins and phago-lysosome fusion regarding Cdt-mediated PI pool
imbalance in macrophage. In Aim 2, Dr. Kim will study effect of Cdt on macrophage and survivability of Aa by
using wild type and Cdt deficient mutant Aa. Furthermore, Dr. Kim will investigate the pro-inflammatory and
oxidative stress in relation to survivability of Aa. For aim 3, Dr. Kim will investigate synthetic secoisolariciresinol
diglucoside (LGM2605), potent free radical scavenger, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent, in mitigating Aa
mediated inflammation and bone loss via in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, these studies will further our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of Aa in the evasion of phagocytosis and early events in
microbial dysbiosis. Moreover, we will expand future therapeutic strategy for LAP with a potential anti-
inflammatory agent."

This project focuses on task shifting and integrating the evidence-based WHO Package of Essential
Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (WHO-PEN) approach to managing cardiovascular disease risk
factors and cardiometabolic complication of HIV into routine care settings for persons living with HIV in
Lusaka, Zambia. Using local data and implementation science theories, we will adapt WHO-PEN for the
national HIV program in Zambia, and create a streamlined, task-shifted evidence-based intervention that
we have coined “TASKPEN”. TASKPEN will focus on addressing challenges faced by HIV patients who
have cardio-metabolic complications related to HIV or its treatment, but in the future could be expanded to
address other noncommunicable diseases. TASKPEN aims to improve detection and management of these
complications. We hypothesize that the TASKPEN intervention will result in reduced cardiovascular disease
risk as determined by the Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) risk score, as well
as clinical improvement in a number of secondary end-points, including HIV viral suppression, for HIV-
positive patients attending PEPFAR-supported HIV clinics in the urban Lusaka district of Zambia. The
implementation strategies used will enable productive interactions between activated, informed patients
and proactive, prepared health care professionals by task shifting most of the care to nurses and
community health workers who will be supported by the training and adapted screening and treatment
algorithms based on WHO-PEN protocols. TASKPEN will be integrated into routine primary care HIV
services where nurses and community health workers lead the intervention. As the individual components
of TASKPEN are already recommended by Zambia national HIV guidelines, screening of participants to
take part in the study will be done as part of routine HIV care. For those eligible, the screening for metabolic
complications will be done at baseline, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Those found with any cardiometabolic
complications will receive an individualized management plan, which will combine usual HIV care plus the
adapted protocol for management of cardiovascular disease risk factors and cardiometabolic complications.
To advocate for scale-up of TASKPEN in Zambia, we plan to evaluate its clinical impact using a cross-
sectional type 2-hybrid effectiveness-implementation stepped-wedge design, which is a quasi-experimental
design that allows for measurement of clinical effectiveness alongside assessment of implementation
outcomes and strategies. Our hope is that by the end of the study, the Zambian Ministry of Health will
maintain TASKPEN at all study facilities and would consider wider scale-up in the Zambian health system."
10914883,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Streptococcus pneumoniae is estimated to cause over 1.6 million deaths/year worldwide. Pneumococcal disease
and related deaths are much more frequent in the elderly. The growing emergence of antibiotic-resistant S.
pneumoniae strains places increasing reliance on effective pneumococcal vaccines to protect this at-risk
population. The native pneumococcal vaccine currently used in adults consists of capsular polysaccharides
(PPS) derived from 23 different serotypes and therefore provides broad coverage against invasive disease with
an estimated efficacy of ~65-70%. Nonetheless, protection eventually wanes as antibody titers diminish,
typically by 5-10 years post-immunization, and protection against pneumonia is limited. Optimizing protective
vaccine responses in the elderly is therefore a major goal. However, in humans there are clear differences
between elderly males and females with respect to humoral responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide
antigens. We have found the same to be true in mice. The cause of these differences has gone uninvestigated
and therefore highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how sex-related differences impact humoral
immunity in the aged. Given the continued burden of pneumococcal disease in the elderly, an investigation of
the underlying factors contributing to altered immunity to S. pneumoniae with a strong consideration for sex
bias is long overdue. Three specific aims are designed to probe factors regulating B cell immunity to
pneumococcal polysaccharides and phosphorylcholine (PC) in aged males and females. In Aim 1, we will
determine the extent to which age and sex hormones impact the development, phenotype, and functional
responses of B-1b cells and PPS3-specific B cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanisms contributing to
altered PC-specific B cell populations and natural antibody secretion between aged males and females and
examine the consequences these alterations have for protection against pneumococcal infections. In Aim 3, we
will investigate the extent to which sex-driven differences impact protective mucosal responses to S.
pneumoniae. Our studies will thereby investigate the extent to which biological sex and gender-influencing
hormones intersect to impact the regulation of protective pneumococcal immunity throughout the lifespan.
Our results are expected to have a significant impact on the future design and administration of sex- and age-
appropriate vaccines, as well as promote informed decision-making for patients receiving hormone
replacement or gender-affirming therapy, such that optimal protection against pneumococcal infections can be
achieved."
10914884,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a form of skin cancer, originating from keratinocytes, that kills an
estimated 8000 people per year in the United States. Compared to other cancers with similar incidences, death
tolls, and/or economic burdens, our understanding of the genomic landscape and genetic evolution of
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is limited. The overarching goals of this grant are to define the driver
mutations in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, to delineate the genetic evolution of cutaneous squamous
cell carcinomas from precursor lesions, and to establish the earliest genetic alterations occurring in pre-
neoplastic keratinocytes. Towards these goals, in aim1, we will identify driver mutations in exome and genome
sequencing data covering cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This data will be aggregated from publicly
available sources as well as new sequencing data from our own institution, collectively comprising the largest
analysis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma sequencing data to date. In aim2, we will sequence cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas and the remnant precursor lesions from which they arose. Most cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas are discovered adjacent to benign precursor lesions known as actinic keratoses,
and here, we will analyze patient-matched lesions to reveal the mutations driving the transition from the benign
to the malignant state. In aim3, we will elucidate the earliest somatic alterations occurring in individual
keratinocytes from normal skin. Deep sequencing of normal skin has shown that keratinocytes can form
patches of related cells, sometimes harboring mutations known to drive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,
but no studies have truly genotyped keratinocytes at single-cell resolution, leaving gaps in our knowledge of
the incipient events that occur in pre-neoplastic keratinocytes. We have developed an innovative workflow to
call mutations in individual skin cells with high specificity and sensitivity, permitting us to catalog, for the first
time, the genomic alterations in human skin at single-cell resolution.
Similar lines of genomic studies have proven fundamental in advancing our understanding of other cancers by
revealing therapeutic points of intervention, biomarkers to measure disease progression, biomarkers to
estimate disease likelihood, and guidance on the best prevention tactics. Here, we will address these gaps in
knowledge for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Taken together, completion of these studies will realize
longstanding goals within the field of dermatology, which will pave the way for new treatment strategies and
new preventions strategies to alleviate the public health burden posed by cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma."
10914891,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive and metastatic subtype of breast cancer, is one
of the major causes of cancer death in women. TNBC also has lower survival rates for primarily local
cancers. Loss of hormone receptors and the lack of HER2 overexpression in TNBC limit treatments to
cytotoxic therapies such as radiation, a key clinical strategy for 10-15% of breast cancer patients. Hypoxia
is a major cause of resistance to radiotherapy, chemotherapy and even immunotherapy. Thus, identifying
mechanisms to suppress the hypoxia stress response and increase the sensitivity of TNBC tumors to
therapy remains a top clinical priority. Upon hypoxic stress, cancer cells initiate a transcriptional program that
enables them to survive and migrate from an inhospitable microenvironment. While hypoxia-inducible factors
(HIFs) are generally considered the main effectors, growing evidence suggests the hypoxia cellular response is
much more complex and requires coordinated signaling with other stress response factors. One promising
candidate is BACH1, a transcription factor that is induced by hypoxia and represses transcription of genes
involved in heme oxidation and anti-oxidant production. Based on preliminary results, we now hypothesize that
BACH1 is stabilized by hypoxia and functions as a key inducer of the cellular hypoxia response in TNBC
cells leading to abnormal leaky vasculature that contributes to intratumoral hypoxia and radiation
resistance. Specifically, we plan to: 1. Determine whether BACH1 is regulated by oxygen and induces a
transcriptional hypoxic stress response in TNBC cells; 2. Determine whether BACH1 promotes angiogenesis,
leaky vasculature and hypoxia in TNBC tumors; and 3. Determine whether BACH1 depletion sensitizes TNBC
tumors to radiation. We propose that targeting BACH1 represents a unique strategy for increasing tumor
oxygenation to improve the efficacy of cytotoxic, standard-of-care therapies such as radiation. Normalizing
vasculature to suppress leakiness should also facilitate drug delivery to tumors. Since BACH1 can be targeted
by an FDA approved drug either alone or in combination with HIF inhibitors, the proposed work could lead to a
clinical trial in breast cancer and other cancer patients whose treatment involves radiation therapy."

The overall purpose of the Preclinical Models Core is to facilitate the accomplishment of the translational
research goals and objectives of the SPORE by providing investigators with a biobank of state-of-the-art
patient-derived and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of prostate cancer. These models include
23 patient-derived organoid (PDO) lines and 14 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines, as well as GEMMs of
genetic alterations studied in the SPORE projects and organoids derived from these models. In addition, the
Preclinical Models Core will provide assistance in the design and generation of transgenic and
knockout/knockin mouse strains and will serve as a centralized repository for these mouse strains and
materials of common interest, such as dissected tissues, DNA, RNA, and protein extracts from these strains.
The Preclinical Models Core will generate, characterize, and maintain clinically and molecularly annotated
PDOs and PDXs for use by SPORE investigators; generate and provide a repository of GEMMs and murine
engineered prostate organoid models; and provide histopathologic analyses and design preclinical trials. The
Preclinical Models Core will collaborate with RP-1 to use unique PDOs with mutations in homologous
recombination genes as well as mouse organoids with BRCA2 deletion for validation studies of determinants of
PARP inhibitor sensitivity; with RP-2 to provide genetically defined models for preclinical trials to evaluate

existing NIH funding to investigate specific hypotheses related to how HIV infection in the pregnant woman leads
to adverse birth outcomes and ensuing pediatric immune dysfunction through rigorous clinical and basic science
laboratory training. TIGRIS is a multidisciplinary, international and intercontinental African HIV training program.
The program will be implemented at Stellenbosch University (SU) in South Africa along with the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, USA. Mentorship will be provided by our extensive international Faculty in the US (Morehouse
School of Medicine, Stanford University, Duke University, Weill Cornell Medical College, University of
Cincinnati – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Seattle Children’s Research Institute and
Harvard University), Canada (University of Toronto) and in the UK (Universities of Cambridge and Surrey)
to provide laboratory training for existing registered MMed, PhD and Post-Doctoral Fellows through short- and
medium-term laboratory training in South Africa and in LMICs in west, east and southern Africa. This training will
strengthen laboratory investigations and generate novel data by having access to state-of-the-art technologies
and data analysis. By so doing, the over-arching aim of TIGRIS will be to strengthen HIV research by studying
reproductive and neonatal immunology in Africa and specifically around mother-infant dyads during maternal
HIV infection. TIGRIS has three specific aims: 1) Create and implement a short- and medium-term laboratory
training program in reproductive immunology in the context of maternal HIV infection in pregnancy; 2) To
launch and sustain a two-semester structured didactic post-graduate course in reproductive and neonatal
Immunology that will supplement and enrich existing training for Clinician Scientists, graduate students working
towards PhD degrees, and Post-doctoral Fellows; 3) To create bilateral engagement between Stellenbosch
University and the Mayo Clinic with Benin, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda. We have successfully used a D71
planning grant to establish the Reproductive Immunology Research Consortium in Africa and to hold stakeholder
meetings that has shaped this D43 application. We will continue to leverage existing funded projects to
implement training in reproductive and neonatal immunology research, to enhance immunology knowledge
capacity and use our extensive expertise of training in Africa for grant writing sessions that will equip young

The goal of the Metabolic Dysregulation and Cancer Risk Consortium (MDCRC) is to identify tangible
mechanistic/etiologic pathways that link obesity-related metabolic dysregulation with cancer risk to inform
cancer prevention strategies. The Consortium proposes to accomplish this through developing common
measures for obesity-related metabolic dysregulation for different cancer types, understanding how obesity-
related metabolic dysregulation affects cancer initiation and development, characterizing signal cross-talk
between key biologic processes that impact obesity-associated metabolic dysregulation and cancer risk, and
determining the utility of emerging approaches for the discovery of novel obesity-associated metabolic targets
in cancer risk and prevention.
The Biostatistics Center (Center) in the Milken Institute School of Public Health (SPH) of the George
Washington University (GW), the participating institution, proposes to serve as the MDCRC Coordinating
Center (CC). The MDCRC CC will integrate this expertise and experience, drawing upon our successful history
of coordinating center leadership in collaborative research consortia, capacity for innovation, and the extensive
scientific expertise in obesity and cancer prevention, nutrition, exercise, metabolism, body composition, and
bioinformatics/computational biology to form a CC that is rooted in scientific rigor and is flexible and responsive
to the diverse challenges and scientific opportunities of the MDCRC.
The specific aims of the MDCRC include to 1) provide scientific leadership and project management for
collaborative cross-Consortium activities, including providing guidance on the selection of common measures
and development of consistent protocols and manuals of operations, maintain private and public websites,
establishing topical work groups, and spearhead outreach activities; 2) facilitate data harmonization, data
sharing and results dissemination across the MDCRC sites and with NCI, including identification of
opportunities for novel data collection to enrich the MDCRC data resources, developing a common data
management platform, and training for site staff; and 3) establish a Self-Evaluation Core to promote timely self-
evaluation, along with effective self-correcting actions, working with NCI and the Consortium investigators to
establish criteria and outputs related to the “success” of individual investigators, study teams, and Consortium
sites."

The overarching goal of this K01 is to support the training of Dr. Alex Russell. His goal is to become an
independent alcohol use disorder (AUD) recovery researcher with expertise in how to leverage social media
platforms to enhance AUD treatment and recovery outcomes in novel and innovative ways. To help achieve this
goal, the candidate proposes an original mentored research study focused on developing scientific knowledge
about AUD and recovery-related social media exposures in order to define prominent social-media based
barriers to and facilitators of AUD recovery, and thereby informing narrative-based social media interventions
designed to enhance AUD treatment and recovery outcomes. In aim 1, we will characterize AUD and recovery-
related exposures on Twitter by conducting a qualitative content analysis using an unsupervised machine
learning and inductive coding approach – identifying potential barriers to/facilitators of recovery present on
Twitter. In aim 2, we will use latent class analysis to identify underlying content similarities between clusters of
tweets, over and above individual themes. We will also determine how varying post characteristics (e.g., format,
source) and content cluster themes are associated with user engagement (i.e., likes, retweets). In aim 3, social
network analysis will be used to examine the network structure of barriers/facilitators-related posts, identifying
important opinion-leaders and topics about AUD and recovery on Twitter (targets for later intervention) and to
determine how network position of posts varies by post characteristics (e.g., format, source) and domains of
AUD recovery barriers and facilitators. This mentored study is intended to facilitate training to help the candidate
develop the expertise to build an independent research career. More specifically, Dr. Russell’s mentorship team
(Philip Massey, Brandon Bergman, John Kelly, Dana Litt, and Brian Primack) will foster his scientific development
in the following areas: 1) AUD recovery science (addiction treatment and recovery, mechanisms of recovery-
related behavior change, digital recovery support services); 2) social media-based research methods (theory,
data collection, measurement, analyses, and interpretation); 3) latent class analysis; 4) social network analysis;
and 5) career development and grantsmanship. Additionally, Dr. Russell’s training plan will supplement practical
experiences and mentorship with formal coursework and workshop attendance, and dissemination of research
findings at conferences. His career goals are in line with NIAAA’s emphases on a) the identification and
development of strategies to reduce personal and organizational barriers that prevent people with alcohol use
disorders from seeking and receiving appropriate care, b) the study of potentially vital recovery mechanisms
during an at-risk developmental stage, c) the development and testing of methods that can enhance the diffusion
and adoption of evidence-based alcohol-related treatment practices across the full spectrum of services for at-
risk, harmful, and dependent drinkers, and d) the development of innovative behavioral strategies to promote
drinking-related behavior change (PA-15-299)."
10914145,"Human parainfluenza virus (PIV) and metapneumovirus (MPV) are common causes of lower respiratory
tract infections in infants and young children, and major causes of respiratory illness in immune compromised
adults and the elderly. Unfortunately, there are no therapy or vaccine for either viruses, and only supportive
medical care is available. Interestingly, PIV and MPV share many pathological and clinical manifestations as
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Indeed, neither PIV nor MPV are known to cause viremia in the blood of
infected patients, indicating both infections are strictly localized in the airways similar to RSV that shed progeny
viruses exclusively from the apical surface of infected cells. Such unique pathophysiology implies progeny
viruses must traverse airway mucus (AM) before spreading to neighboring cells. This in turn motivated us to
develop a pathogen-specific antiviral that could physically limit the spread of the infections within the airways.
 We recently discovered a novel Ab effector function in mucus – trapping individual pathogens in mucus
based on carefully-tuned affinity between IgG-Fc and mucins – and developed a platform for enhancing mAb
function at mucosal surfaces. We hypothesize that “muco-trapping” mAb delivered to the airways can directly
intervene with the viral life cycle by intercepting and trapping shed progeny viruses in AM, rapidly eliminate
trapped viruses from the airways by natural mucociliary clearance, and enable effective therapy in vivo. In
support of this strategy, we engineered mAbs that potently trap RSV in AM, and showed that nebulized
delivery of “muco-trapping” mAb to RSV-infected neonatal lambs beginning on Day 3 post infection effectively
reduced the infectious viral load in lung tissues to non-detectible levels within 3 days, with viral RNA in
bronchial tissues reduced by 11-fold compared to vehicle control. These results motivated us to explore
whether a similar approach may be effective in treating PIV and MPV infections. In support of this application,
we have engineered antibodies with picomolar affinity to diverse strains of both viruses, and demonstrated that
we could effectively trap viruses in human AM and limit spread of infection in vitro in well-differentiated human
airway epithelium (WD-HAE) grown at the air-liquid interface.
 In this proposal, we will continue our work with affinity maturation using mammalian and yeast display
to produce high affinity mAb that broadly bind and neutralize diverse strains of PIV and MPV (Aim 1). We will
validate whether these mAbs can trap PIV and MPV in fresh undiluted human AM, and whether they can inhibit
the spread of pre-established PIV and MPV infections in WD-HAE cultures (Aim 2). We will then advance the
lead mAb for both viruses for evaluation in a hamster nasal infection model (Aim 3). By enabling enhanced
mAb function in mucus secretions, we expect we will help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted
therapies and prophylaxis against a broad spectrum of pathogens across all major mucosal surfaces, providing
a powerful option addressing the current gap in pharmacological interventions for respiratory infections."

Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most commonly acquired heart disease among children and young adults
worldwide. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (secondary prevention) with monthly intramuscular benzathine
penicillin G (BPG) is a cornerstone of RHD control programs and has been used successfully for decades in
wealthy countries. Unfortunately, because of neglect in the global and national health agendas, most RHD-
endemic countries (like Uganda) have no RHD programs, so most of the estimated 40 million people living with
RHD worldwide remain undiagnosed and unprotected from further valvular damage. Considering these
challenges, our objective is to partner with the Ugandan government to test a novel community-based program,
ADUNU (Acholi for “heart”) that aims to find individuals with RHD and provide secondary prevention close to
where they live. The program will be tested in two districts (one demonstration, one replication), building a
foundation for national scale-up beyond the proposed research. ADUNU is based on two core, evidence-based
technologies, (1) RHD testing using handheld echocardiography in community settings and (2) nurse-led,
registry-based delivery of secondary prevention. ADUNU is a non-randomized experiment that will set up a new
system in settings where RHD-related healthcare currently does not exist, with the goal of finding new cases and
enrolling them in local registries that provide secondary prevention. ADUNU will be integrated with general
primary healthcare and track outcomes over time, key factors in sustainability and scalability. In Aim 1, we will
evaluate ADUNU using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
framework, mapped to the RHD Care Cascade (an adaptation of the cascade used for HIV). Primary quantitative
outcomes in each of RE-AIM’s five dimensions will be supplemented with qualitative data from in-depth
interviews and administrative data. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of
ADUNU in these two districts in order to justify investment and plan for scale-up of the program nationally in
Uganda, beyond the proposed study. ADUNU will provide much-needed evidence to government
stakeholders in RHD-endemic countries, demonstrating how a pragmatic, community-based strategy
can deliver guideline-based care to people living with RHD. It will also provide critical, and currently
absent, evidence on the cost-effectiveness, affordability, and sustainability of RHD programs in
resource-limited settings."

Kinases, a class of proteins with more than 500 members in the human proteome, are important regulators of
biological processes in health and disease. Kinases have proven to be excellent drug targets with more than 70
FDA approved medicines that target kinases. Despite this success, most kinases are understudied, and details
of their functions are poorly understood. The NEK family of 11 kinases (NEK1 through NEK11) is a particularly
understudied set of kinases that play roles in key biological processes like the cell cycle, ciliogenesis, and the
DNA damage response (DDR), all with relevance to cancer and human health. These kinases have emerging
links to numerous cancers, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, ciliopathies, and ALS. In this project we will
use an efficient kinase systems-based approach to create an enabling suite of chemical probes, assays,
reagents, and molecular tools to identify NEK family members that have key roles in cancer. These high-quality
compounds and reagents we generate, which we will freely share, will allow scientists to build a deep
understanding of the physiological and pathological roles members of the NEK family play. In Aim 1 we will
create potent and selective inhibitors of each NEK using iterative medicinal chemistry and state of the art in cell
target engagement assays. In a complementary effort for this aim we will also create inducible NEK knockdown
cell lines. In Aim 2, using compounds and the NEK knockdown lines, we will evaluate the role and importance of
each NEK in a suite of NEK and oncology-relevant cell health and cell biology signaling assays, measuring
effects on proliferation, migration, the cell-cycle, DNA replication, and ciliogenesis. In Aim 3 we will
experimentally determine the substrates of each NEK, locate the NEKs in broader kinase-dependent signaling
pathways, and develop genetically targetable kinase activity reporters for tracking NEK activity within the
endogenous cellular environment. Output from this project will include potent and selective NEK inhibitors, NEK
family-wide assays, details on the impact of NEK inhibition and knockdown on key cancer processes, molecular
tools, and NEK substrate and pathway information. Successful completion will provide a framework and the
resources needed to validate individual NEKs as high quality, druggable targets for the treatment of cancer."

Hypoxic Pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is characterized by elevated right ventricle pressures, increased
vascular remodeling and resistance, and it is often fatal. Dysregulated immunity underlies the
pathophysiology of the disease, which is supported by the elevated numbers of inflammatory cells around
the remodeled vessels, as well as high levels of inflammatory cytokines present in the plasma of patients
from different PH groups. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional-antigen presenting cells that scan and
sense their tissue microenvironment, coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses. Classical
dendritic cells (cDCs) are divided in two different subsets: cDC1 (CD11b-/CD103+) and cDC2 (CD11b+).
Activated DCs modify their immediate tissue microenvironment by secreting chemokines and cytokines
that attract other inflammatory cells, including monocytes/ macrophages. Besides, activated cDCs drive
polarization of naïve T cells into different effector phenotypes, most importantly CD4+/Th17 cells, which
have been linked to experimental HPH. Therefore, there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that
dendritic cells are orchestrators of the PH-related immune response, including their augmented presence
around remodeled vessels in different etiologies of PH; however, there are few studies that address
pathogenic mechanisms in which these cells could participate in PH. Our preliminary data indicate that
bone-marrow-derived cDCs, particularly cDC2 that is increased in hypoxic PH lungs, are triggers of
hypoxia-induced HPH; that monocyte/ macrophage recruitment and Th17 polarization may be dependent
on cDC. The overall goal of this project is to determine the mechanistic role of the classical dendritic cell
subset cDC2, in driving the recruitment of pro-remodeling thrombospondin-1- expressing monocytes to
the lung, as well as directing T cell responses, which cause vascular remodeling in hypoxic pulmonary
hypertension (HPH). This project will be highly innovative in pulmonary vascular diseases and will serve
as a foundation to continue exploring this rich investigative research field, which will be essential to my
transition to an independent investigator."

Although the USA has seen a significant increase in the number of PhD degrees in the biomedical sciences
earned by scientists from underrepresented and racially minoritized (URM) backgrounds, there has not been a
corresponding increase in the representation of URM faculty in the biomedical professoriate. To address this
disparity in the state of Minnesota and more broadly, the University of Minnesota formulated and implemented
the Minnesota IRACDA Program. The Minnesota IRACDA Program is a collaboration between the University of
Minnesota and the nearby community colleges of Normandale Community College and North Hennepin
Community College, which predominantly serve students from minority and low-income urban populations. The
Minnesota IRACDA Program provides a diverse cohort of recent PhD scholars with rigorous scientific research
training, instruction, mentoring, experience in teaching, and career development guidance. The long-term goal
of the Minnesota IRACDA Program is to develop and implement successful and creative strategies to promote
and facilitate the transition of talented postdoctoral researchers from diverse backgrounds into independent
faculty careers in biomedical research and education. The overall objectives of the Minnesota IRACDA Program
are to: (1) Recruit postdoctoral scholars from backgrounds that have been historically excluded from STEM
research and education and provide them with strong multitiered mentoring in cutting-edge biomedical research.
(2) Provide the postdoctoral scholars with pedagogical training in modern teaching techniques that incorporate
diverse populations, and mentored practice in evidence-based teaching at the undergraduate level at two
teaching-intensive institutions that predominantly serve students from minority and low-income urban
populations—Normandale Community College and North Hennepin Community College. (3) Equip postdoctoral
scholars with a multitude of career and professional development opportunities and programs including,
participation in workshops that address scientific communication, publication, job searches, grant writing,
professional advancement, and diversity, equity, and inclusion in biomedical research. (4) Provide URM
undergraduates from the teaching-intensive partner institutions with paid authentic research opportunities at the
University of Minnesota in which they are mentored by the postdoctoral scholars. In the first funding period, the
Minnesota IRACDA Program met or exceeded all key benchmarks: (i) Nearly 40% of the IRACDA scholars
recruited to the program were from URM backgrounds. (ii) IRACDA scholars were successful in career
progression. Of the six scholars who completed training, four moved on to tenure-track Assistant Professor or
Lecturer positions. (iii) URM undergraduate students participated in authentic research under the mentorship of
IRACDA scholars and most successfully transferred to four-year degree programs. We are seeking funding to
support six IRACDA postdoctoral scholars per year when the program is fully populated."
10909081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal leverages cephalopods as a uniquely suited model system to ask how sensory systems detect
and discriminate diverse environmental signals. Octopuses, as representative cephalopods, use their flexible
arms and semi-autonomous distributed nervous system to explore their surroundings at a distance by locally
detecting and capturing prey. This unique “taste by touch” system is mediated by chemotactile receptors (CRs),
which are structurally similar to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but are insensitive to neurotransmitters, and
instead detect poorly soluble molecules to mediate contact-dependent aquatic sensation. Here, we will exploit
cephalopod chemotactile systems to understand how subtle evolutionary modifications in single proteins
facilitate a functional transition from neuronal signaling to environmental sensation. Our approach spans
structural biology to animal behavior. First, in Aim 1, we propose to determine high resolution structures of ligand-
bound and apo octopus CRs to analyze structural and biophysical underpinnings of sensory versus
neurotransmitter receptor function. In Aim 2, we will extend our comparative approach to CRs in distinct
cephalopods with specific behaviors. In contrast to octopuses that use arms for active exploration, cuttlefish are
ambush predators that strike and capture unsuspecting prey with their eight arms and two long tentacles. We
recently discovered CRs in cuttlefish, which detect distinct ligands, exhibit different voltage dependence, and
enable unique behaviors. Here, we will extend our analyses to include structurally informed experiments to
compare aspects of ligand binding, ion permeation, and channel gating to ask how receptor function is suited to
particular organismal behaviors. Finally, we recently found that octopus sensory cells express diverse CR subunit
combinations that can form homo- and heteropentameric ion channel complexes. Subunit composition alters
ligand sensitivity and ion permeation to tune signal detection, transduction, and filtering to influence peripheral
processing in the octopus’ unusual distributed nervous system. In Aim 3, we will analyze the structural basis by
which heteromeric complexes alter biophysical properties of ligand binding, ion permeation, and channel gating.
Collectively, these studies will reveal broad principles underlying the structural basis for sensory receptor function
and the evolution of biological novelty."

The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to have enormous medical, societal and economic implications worldwide.
While combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has greatly reduced the global burden of HIV, the ability of the
virus to establish a persistent reservoir within the body requires that HIV-infected individuals remain on lifelong
treatment. As a result, new modalities that can suppress the viral reservoir and thereby limit the requirement of
HIV treatment are greatly needed. Recent efforts have been focused on the induction of cytotoxic T cells
(CTLs) by therapeutic vaccines. However, the accumulation of CTL escape mutations in chronically infected,
cART-suppressed patients has greatly limited the ability of CTLs to successfully prevent viral rebound following
cART cessation. Thus, in order to counteract this viral escape, this DP2 proposal will focus on the study of CTL
responses to a new set of targets, known as `highly networked' epitopes, to determine whether they can form
the basis of a novel therapeutic CTL-based vaccine for HIV. These highly networked epitopes were identified
using an innovative approach known as structure-based network analysis. By applying network theory
principles to HIV protein structure data, the approach was able to identify a set of epitopes that are intolerant to
mutation, but which are also presented by a broad array of HLA alleles. Moreover, the targeting of highly
networked epitopes by functional CTL responses was shown to strongly distinguish individuals who naturally
control HIV from those with progressive disease. Thus, the goal now is to determine whether CTLs directed
against highly networked epitopes can also suppress viral outgrowth following cART cessation in the remaining
~99% of chronically-infected, cART-treated individuals. This will be accomplished by: (i) deep sequencing
highly networked epitopes in proviral DNA derived from peripheral blood and gastrointestinal tissue and (ii)
determining whether CTLs targeting highly networked epitopes can suppress latent virus outgrowth both ex
vivo and in a humanized mouse model. Demonstrating the effectiveness of CTL-mediated responses to highly
networked epitopes will confirm the value of the structure-based network analysis approach to guide the
rational design of a effective, therapeutic CTL-based vaccine for HIV."
10909202,"Proper development depends on asymmetric cell division (ACD), a process by which dividing stem cells
produce a renewed stem cell and a differentiating cell. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors guiding ACD have
been found and characterized. Yet, the contribution of chromatin to cell-fate determination is poorly
understood. Previously, our lab discovered asymmetries in histone and histone post-translational modification
(hPTM) inheritance in Drosophila male germ cells. Further dissection of this process revealed it functions and
is regulated in three-steps: 1) histone asymmetry is established during S-phase; 2) histone asymmetry is
distinguished during M-phase; 3) the readout of the inherited asymmetric histones guides cell cycle
progression following mitotic exit. Interestingly, disruption of these asymmetries results in both stem cell loss
and overproliferation phenotypes, suggesting that asymmetric histone inheritance is an essential process in
tissue health. Further, deterioration of this process may be common among diseases including age-related
tissue degeneration and cancer. I hypothesize that asymmetric histone inheritance is a general mechanism
that plays a crucial role in stem cell homeostasis and cell-fate determination during development. However, our
ability to track histones and hPTMs at specific loci within single cells is severely limited at this time. Thus, we
are in urgent need of new tools to study the roles and consequences of asymmetric histone inheritance in
development, stem cell homeostasis, and cell-fate determination. In this proposal, I will 1) broaden our
understanding of pervasiveness, roles, and patterns of histone inheritance in asymmetrically dividing cells and
2) develop a novel method for labeling non-repetitive loci to track epigenomic features.
 First, I will express histones tagged with the photoconvertible Dendra2 in Drosophila neuronal stem cell
lineages. Neuroblasts (NBs), their progenies ganglion mother cells (GMCs), and transit-amplifying intermediate
neuronal progenitors (INPs) are a well-studied stem cell model system. Following 405nm light induced
photoconversion, I will observe the inheritance patterns of old (red) versus new (green) histones in type I and II
NBs. These studies will 1) expand our knowledge on histone inheritance in ACD, and 2) reveal whether histone
inheritance patterns change as asymmetrically dividing cells age and lose potency (e.g. INPs).
 Tracking epigenomic information at specific genomic locations has traditionally been performed using
FISH. However, the heat denaturation required for FISH is either partially or completely incompatible with
detection of DNA-associated proteins. To overcome this limitation, I will adapt Oligopaint technologies to
design guide RNA libraries for tethering dCas9 to specific, non-repetitive loci. This will allow me to track
histone and hPTM inheritance patterns at specific genomic loci with single-cell resolution.
 These works will both enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ACD and provide new
tools facilitating the detection of epigenomic alterations in research and clinical settings."

Modifiable behavioral factors, including tobacco use, alcohol consumption, diet, exercise, and sun exposure,
account for up to 75% of cancer cases and figure prominently in response to treatments and risk of relapse. In
addition, heightened risk for cancer, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, often come with significant
harms to psychological functioning and quality of life, which in turn may adversely affect cancer outcomes.
Despite decades of research on behavioral aspects of cancer prevention and control (BCPC), many individuals
continue to engage in risky behaviors, and many continue to bear the considerable psychological burdens
associated with cancer risk, diagnosis, treatment and survival. Major barriers to continued progress in this area
include: 1) the relatively small fraction of scientists who focus their work on BCPC, 2) a lack of awareness of
BCPC career opportunities when college students consider their advanced educational options, 3) a lack of
opportunities to receive formal early training in BCPC research, and 4) a lack of stewardship of outstanding
college students to help them transition from research labs to successful graduate education. Moreover, BCPC
scientists are increasingly unprepared to tackle the unique behavioral and psychological challenges faced by an
increasingly culturally diverse population. The program aims to address these critical training gaps by providing
15-week immersive summer research, mentoring, and career development experiences for outstanding
undergraduates (n=16/summer) from the City University of New York (CUNY), the largest urban university
system in the U.S. With all of its eleven senior colleges federally-designated minority-serving institutions, the
diverse and talented CUNY student body provides an ideal pool of dedicated, promising young scholars to benefit
from the proposed program. We will match outstanding students with behavioral scientists from CUNY's Hunter
College (HC), or the nearby Center for Behavioral Oncology at the renowned Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai (ISMMS), with which HC maintains close collaborations. The program will go beyond simple summer lab
experiences, offering collaborative multidisciplinary idea-generation projects, biweekly career development
meetings as a cohort, creating opportunities for students to develop lasting relationships with experts in the field,
as well as future colleagues, and provide critical transitional mentoring during the process of applying for
graduate education. Connecting with the next generation of scientists from an early stage and shepherding them
through the challenging transition from undergraduate to advanced education is a critical step supporting the
continuity of trainees' development that is all too often ignored. We will also leverage the considerable resources
of HC's larger NIH-funded Cancer Health Disparities Partnership, which will provide scaffolding and infrastructure
to efficiently execute the program. Finally, we will conduct ongoing, rigorous multifocal outcome evaluations to
determine the effectiveness of the program and make real-time programmatic adjustments as needed."

The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Nils Petersen, a Neurocritical Care and Stroke Neurologist at Yale-New
Haven Hospital, and Assistant Professor at Yale University School of Medicine. Dr. Petersen is a physician-
scientist with specialized knowledge of human cerebral hemodynamics who is investigating personalized,
autoregulation-guided blood pressure management after ischemic stroke. About 40% of patients with ischemic
stroke due to intracranial large-vessel occlusion (LVO) are rendered non-ambulatory, bedridden or deceased
despite treatment with endovascular thrombectomy. Abnormalities in cerebrovascular autoregulation in the acute
phase of LVO stroke increase the risk of secondary brain injury from relative cerebral hypo- or hyperperfusion.
Thus, autoregulation-guided, personalized blood pressure management presents a promising alternative to the
current practice of targeting fixed thresholds. By providing a more favorable physiologic environment for the
injured brain, the autoregulation-guided approach may reduce secondary brain injury and improve outcomes.
Preliminary data obtained by Dr. Petersen have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan that uses near-
infrared spectroscopy and real-time data processing to identify a patient-specific blood pressure range that yields
optimal brain blood flow. This research proposal will evaluate if blood pressure management outside
personalized limits of autoregulation increases the risk for neurologic worsening from infarct progression or
hemorrhagic transformation, leading to increased rates of unfavorable outcome (Aim 1). Next, Dr. Petersen will
evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic blood pressure interventions and explore the feasibility of an
intervention protocol targeting a personalized blood pressure range (Aim 2). Under the expert mentorship of Dr.
Kevin Sheth, Chief of Neurocritical Care, Dr. Randolph Marshall, Director of Stroke Division at Columbia
University, and Dr. Cynthia Brandt, Director of Medical Informatics, this K23 award will allow Dr. Petersen 1) to
acquire skills in informatics, advanced signal processing and machine learning in order to enhance current
methods of quantifying cerebral autoregulation, 2) to develop expertise in clinical trial design, 3) to build a
research group dedicated to discovery and clinical evaluation of physiology-based individualized treatment
strategies after stroke, and 4) to foster inter-institutional collaboration and data-sharing. This proposal will
leverage Yale’s cutting-edge neuro-monitoring technologies along with extensive informatics and research
resources from the Yale Center for Clinical Investigation to generate new insights into cerebral hemodynamics
and identify treatment opportunities. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Petersen will be well-positioned
to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in the area of cerebral
hemodynamics. His long-term goal is to use neuro-monitoring to develop physiology-based, personalized, early
interventions to reduce the disability and morbidity associated with stroke."
10909212,"Abstract
Kidney transplantation elicits powerful B cell responses that generate antibodies specific for the transplant
donor. B cell responses to allogeneic HLA (panel reactive antibodies, PRA) and to the transplant donor (donor-
specific antibodies, DSA) correlate with risk of rejection and graft loss and thus serve as diagnostic indices of
allo-immunity. B cell responses that generate DSA initiate the most vexing types of rejection (antibody-
mediated rejection, ABMR) and chronic ABMR and hence much interest exists in development of therapeutics
that specifically target B cells. Some B cell responses however may correlate with or even promote graft
survival (immune regulation, accommodation, operational tolerance). Although there has been extensive
investigation of the specificity and function of the blood DSA hardly anything is known about the properties of
donor-specific B cells. The research we propose will identify for the first time key characteristics of
donor-specific B cell responses in kidney transplant recipients to determine what properties associate
with and potentially contribute to stable graft function, as opposed to rejection. As a first objective,
donor-specific B cell responses will be studied by determining Heavy and Light chain Ig sequences of donor-
specific B cells by single cell sequencing and their phenotypic signature by RNA-seq . We will determine key
properties of Ig, such as clonal diversity, extent of somatic hypermutation or Ig independent properties such as
production of cytokines in recipients with stable function or rejection. As a second objective, donor-specific Ig
sequences obtained by NGS will be studied prospectively over periods > a year (up to two years). We will
determine whether clonotypes expand and diversify in anticipation of rejection as would be expected of T cell
dependent responses; and how donor-specific sequences change following rejection treatment. We will also
determine if in recipients with stable grafts, donor-specific B cells encode Igs with distinct properties. As a third
objective, we will conduct the first investigation of key properties (e.g. maximum binding, avidity, direct
activation of donor cells and antigen specificity, where possible, confirmed using graft tissues) of recombinant
monoclonal DSA on donor cells to determine whether these properties could explain differences in
pathogenicity. The research might reveal novel approaches to assessing risk and new targets for biological
intervention. The research might also inspire rational approaches to modifying B cell responses in transplant
recipients in a personalized manner with the goal of promoting protective responses and antagonizing
pathogenic ones."

minorities groups. The Executive committee, composed of Dr. Gomez and all the project PIs with the
internal and external advisory committees will oversee the P&F program, the Enrichment program and the
functioning of the Core. The internal and external advisory committee members are experts in the central
scientific theme of the Center. Those advisors will visit and evaluate the whole program each year and
make recommendations regarding the suitability, funding and continuation of P&F projects and the
direction of the center. The Administrative component will continue to maintain a fully developed website
that describes the Center,highlights the research accomplishments of individual projects and the Core in
Single Cell Epigenomics, Transcriptomics and Bioinformatics, advertises the call for applications to P&F
awards (in coordination with the 2 other PCENs), and publicizes the seminars and symposia provided
through the Enrichment program. Furthermore, all the opportunities and activities will be advertised in the
PCEN Twitter and Facebook accounts. The University of Virginia provides extensive research facilities
with numerous additional core labs to guarantee an exceptional environment for the research activitiesof the
Center investigators. In further support of the Center, the institution has committed funds for salary,
reagents and educational enrichment activities. The PCEN will continue to collaborate with the adult
Nephrology Division via a Pediatric and Adult Nephrology U2C/TL1 training grant, with the Integrated
Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia (iTHRIV), the Center for Public Health Genomics, the
new School of Data Science, the Cardiovascular Research Center (T32) and all the O’Brien and PCENs

10916457,"SUMMARY
The PCEN at UVA will support a combined biomedical research core to assist investigators in two important
areas: 1) Transcriptome and epigenome technologies and 2) Bioinformatics. The Single Cell Epigenomics,
Transcriptomics, and Bioinformatics core will be directed by experienced researchers (Silvia Medrano, Ph.D.
and Nathan Sheffield, Ph.D.) and staffed with highly trained personnel. Through the Single Cell Epigenomics
and Transcriptomics component of the core, the PCEN will generate new data that will require substantial single
cell and bioinformatics resources and expertise. The Bioinformatics component of the core will work closely with
the single cell component and provide both computational infrastructure and analytical support to ensure that
the investigators convert this important data into knowledge. By integrating all these services within a single
core, we will ensure that PCEN investigators carry out their research in a coordinated, cost-effective, and efficient
manner. The core will serve as a resource for the two PCEN main Research Projects and Pilot Projects at all
times. Furthermore, the core will support the broader pediatric kidney research community at UVA and other
institutions. In addition to offering a variety of specialized, innovative and essential research services, techniques,
and instrumentation, the core will provide hands-on training to students, postdocs, fellows and young scientists
as well as consultation services and access to state-of-the-art research equipment. Moreover, the core will
provide support for preparation of manuscripts and grant proposals. The scope of the core is well in line with the
overall theme of this PCEN that is “Regulation of cell fate during kidney development and disease”. The
experimental approaches of the PCEN involve examination of epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms that
control cell fate, plasticity, and identity and the cellular signals underlying the phenotypic transformation that
occurs during kidney injury and repair. The proposed core will provide the specialized technologies and expertise
needed to accomplish the stated goals of the PCEN."
10916459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells are sensors, perfected throughout evolution to interpret and respond to changes in
blood pressure and the composition and volume of the extracellular fluid. Normally, renin release from JG cells
suffice to maintain homeostasis. However, under intense and prolonged physiological challenges (dehydration,
sodium depletion, hypotension) smooth muscle cells (SMCs) along the kidney arterioles reacquire the renin
phenotype and restore homeostasis. Once homeostasis is reestablished, the transformed cells stop making
renin and become SMCs again. Conversely, if the inciting threat is not removed or overcome [as in spontaneous
or experimental mutations of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) genes or chronic inhibition of the RAS in mice,
rats and humans] the relentless chronic stimulation of renin cells leads to the concentric hypertrophy of intrarenal
arteries and arterioles. Numerous hypertrophic renin cells surround -and insert chaotically within- the arteriolar
walls. SMCs accumulate concentrically and inwardly, narrowing the vessel lumens and restricting blood flow,
resulting in ischemia, fibrosis and renal failure. In spite of its medical importance, and the prevalent use of RAS
inhibitors in children and adolescents, the mechanisms underlying the development of this severe, albeit silent,
disease are not known. Our renin cell ablation studies indicated that renin cells are responsible for the vascular
disease not only by physically participating in the thickening of the vessel wall but also by their direct cell-to-cell
interaction with SMCs. Abundant preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that the cAMP and Notch
pathways are responsible for the transformation of renin cells and the arterial disease. We hypothesize that
under chronic unrestrained stimulation, p300 remodels the chromatin of renin cells leading them to a dual
embryonic-senescent phenotype. Further, the transformed renin cells, via Notch activation induce the concentric
vascular hypertrophy of the adjacent SMCs. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that specific imprinted chromatin
domains determine the progressive changes in cell fate responsible for the concentric arterial hypertrophy. Aim
1A will define the identity and fate of the cells that compose the diseased arterioles. Aim 1B will test whether
cells derived from the diseased arterioles are retained in (or reverted to) an embryonic/progenitor state. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that Histone acetyltransferase p300 is responsible for the generation of those chromatin
domains that determine the pathological transformation of renin cells and the concentric arterial hypertrophy.
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the concentric accumulation of adjacent SMCs is mediated by Notch signaling
via the engagement of the Jagged1 ligand in renin cells with the Notch2 receptor in SMCs. Using novel
conceptual and technical approaches, the proposed work will uncover the fundamental mechanisms, chromatin
domains and transcriptional drivers responsible for the changes in cell fate leading to this severe arterial disease.
The work has the potential to open new translational opportunities for the rational identification of targets for the
design of specific therapies that protect the kidneys of children and adults with kidney diseases and hypertension."
10916461,"SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Young children with salt wasting renal diseases are at high risk of developing chronic and severe extracellular
fluid (ECF) volume contraction, leading to growth retardation and poor renal perfusion. Chronic conditions that
threaten homeostasis such as hypotension, hypokalemia, salt depletion, and/or the prolonged used of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in young children
induce the recruitment of renin-producing cells with the resulting hypertrophy of the renal arterioles. This
response however, cannot be sustained for too long without affecting renal perfusion. However, it is unclear what
are the major vascular growth factors involved in this process, and how they affect the growth of renin producing
cells. Previous studies, including our own preliminary work, suggest that Transforming Growth Factor-b (TGF-b)
and Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) interacting with Angiotensin II, play a key role modulating vascular tone,
hypertrophy, and proliferation of juxtaglomerular (JG) and renal vascular smooth muscle cells (RVSMC).
However, very little is known about the role that TGF-b and FGF-2 play in the regulation of renin release and the
phenotype of renin producing cells in young infants. Here, we will test the hypothesis that under conditions
that represent a physiological threat to maintain the ECF volume and/or renal perfusion in infancy, the
Ang II-TGF-b and FGF-2 axis plays a critical role maintaining the normal fate and function of renin-
producing cells and RVSMC. In addition, we hypothesize that when the balance between the RAS, TGF-b and
FGF-2 pathways is disrupted, cells programed for the renin phenotype integrate in a disorderly manner inside
the renal arterioles, precipitating the development of vascular concentric hypertrophic lesions leading to poor
renal perfusion and kidney fibrosis. Using time and cell specific conditional deletion approaches, and single cell
transcriptomic analysis, we will test this hypothesis in three aims. In aim 1 we will test hypothesis that a functional
TGF-b receptor 1 signaling pathway in Ren1 + cells is necessary to sustain the hypertrophy of JG and RVSMC
in response to chronic changes in dietary Na+ / K+ intake or RAS inhibition during early postnatal life, and
determine how renin and the cAMP pathway interact with TGF-b and/or FGF-2 in JG and RVSMC to modulate
their endocrine and contractile phenotypes. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that FGF signaling contributes
to maintain the proper balance between the RAS and TGF-b in JG and RVSMCs under conditions of chronic
RAS stimulation and suppression in young mice. In aim 3 we will define the transcriptome profile and protein
changes that occur in renal arterioles and cells shed in the urine of young rats with poor renal perfusion induced
by Na+ depletion and RAS inhibition, and validate these findings in cells and tissues derived from young infants
undergoing similar conditions. These studies will elucidate new mechanisms whereby the RAS interacts with the
TGF-b and FGF-2 pathways during infancy to modulate the growth of JG and RVSMCs, and maintain the ECF
homeostasis and renal perfusion under conditions of chronic RAS stimulation or suppression in infancy."

10916532,"PROJECT SUMMARY BIOINFORMATICS AND DATA MANAGEMENT (BDMC) CORE
Creating and establishing the translational relevance of mouse models of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease requires
a centralized data management and analysis platform interacting with all Center components. To this end, the
Bioinformatics and Data Management Core (BDMC) will: combine human and mouse data to predict
combinations of genetic factors in polygenic models of LOAD; jointly analyze multi-omics, biomarker, and
imaging data to characterize new mouse models of LOAD; systematically align multimodal mouse data to
analogous human study data to determine the precise disease relevance of each mouse models; identify mouse
models with alterations in pathways targeted by precision therapeutics for preclinical testing; expand, maintain,
and further populate a data-sharing platform for broad and FAIR access of all data and protocols. This core will
address this goal through the following aims: (1) Iteratively analyze human and mouse data to prioritize multi-
factorial mouse models of LOAD; (2) Determine translational relevance of mouse models through alignment with
human LOAD and identification of therapeutically-relevant alterations; (3) Enable open science practices for all
Center mouse models through data dissemination and an interactive web platform. The BDMC will build upon
existing resources such as the AD Knowledge Portal, the MODEL-AD Explorer, the Agora platform, Alz-PED,
and the workflows from existing NIA-funded consortia, including AMP-AD, TREAT-AD, MODEL-AD, MOVE-AD,
and Resilience-AD. We will add the outcomes of this mouse-centered project to this foundation to optimize
translational relevance and responsible data reuse. Internal and external researchers will be positioned to
efficiently and reliably assess the disease relevance of mouse models. Finally, the broader research community
will be empowered to use responsibly use mouse models to understand and guide their research into
therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease."
10916533,"PROJECT SUMMARY PRECLINICAL TESTING (PTC) CORE
The Preclinical Testing Core (PTC) of the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center was established to serve as an expert
technical resource and provide the infrastructure to enable rigorous and unbiased preclinical screening of
proposed therapeutic interventions nominated by the greater research community, and to be tested in mouse
models of late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) characterized by the MODEL-AD Disease Modeling Project.
The PTC pipeline includes an initial primary screen, which evaluates drug stability, formulation, and confirmation
of the active pharmaceutical ingredient followed by pharmacodynamics (PD) and predictive PK/PD modeling to
inform the dose regimen for long-term chronic efficacy studies. The secondary screen includes chronic treatment
that evaluates in vivo target engagement and disease modifying activity utilizing translational non-invasive
PET/CT and behavioral assessments to determine a therapeutic window. Provided the compound meets the
pre-determined Go/No-GO criteria for these endpoints, evaluation for efficacy on cognitive endpoints correlated
to neurophysiological outcomes as measured by EEG, and fluid and imaging biomarkers are conducted. Finally,
at the conclusion of chronic drug treatment, multi-omics analysis (i.e. proteomics, transcriptomics, and
metabolomics) of brain, blood, and CSF are conducted to determine the molecular signatures in response to
drug treatment. In the initial funding period, the PTC established best practices and validated the pipeline for
both small molecules and biologics as well as established a mechanism for the research community to nominate
their compounds for screening through submission to the STOP-AD portal website. Building on these
milestones, for this next phase of MODEL-AD, the following complementary specific aims are proposed with the
ultimate goals to provide better predictive insight on drug response and improve preclinical to clinical translation:
Specific Aims
Aim 1: Support Drug Screening of STOP-AD Submissions Utilizing the Rigorous PTC Testing Strategy.
Aim 2: Enhance the PTC Screening Strategy to Establish Molecular Response Signatures to Therapeutic
Interventions.
Aim 3: To Establish the Utility of Novel Biomarkers to Predict Efficacy of Therapeutic Interventions."
10916534,"PROJECT SUMMARY DISEASE MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND PHENOTYPING (DMP) PROJECT
In the initial funding period, the DMP created and evaluated more than forty new models incorporating 33 LOAD-
relevant alleles. This included a set of platform strains that incorporated humanized APOE4, Trem2*R47H and
humanized Aβ sequence. Platform strains were evaluated from 4 to 24 months through the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-
AD phenotyping pipeline that included PET/CT, multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics),
neuropathology, and fluid biomarker analysis. The first platform strain, LOAD1 (double homozygous for APOE4
and Trem2*R47H) showed primarily age-dependent affects and few genotype-specific effects. For our second
platform strain, LOAD2 (triple homozygous for APOE4, Trem2*R47H and hAβ), we included a high fat/high sugar
diet (HFD) group as an environmental risk factor. Compared to control mice, at 12 months, HFD-fed LOAD2
mice showed elevated levels of insoluble Aβ42, loss of neurons in the subiculum, reduced long-term potentiation
(LTP), and reduced spine densities in the hippocampus. In addition to the platform models, 24 putative genetic
risk variants identified by the Bioinformatics and Data Management core (BDMC) were introduced into LOAD1
or LOAD2 by CRISPR/Cas9 and evaluated by comparing brain transcriptomes to Accelerated Medicines
Partnerships in AD (AMP-AD) data. The putative risk variants were located in both previously identified (e.g.,
Abca7, CR1, Plcg2, Mthfr and Epha1) as well as novel AD risk genes. Through this work, Abca7*A1527G,
Plcg2*M28L and Mthfr*677C>T were prioritized for full characterization through our phenotyping pipeline.
Collectively, these data support our overarching hypothesis that combinations of LOAD-relevant genetic and/or
environmental risk factors, in the absence of familial AD (fAD) mutations, will induce hallmark AD pathologies in
mice and therefore create improved mouse models for preclinical testing. In the renewal we will continue to
evaluate novel LOAD models, with an increased focus on identifying models for the preclinical testing core (PTC).
To achieve this, our phenotyping pipeline has been enhanced and incorporates a combined cross-sectional and
longitudinal design, extensive biomarker analysis, MRI, additional PET ligands (e.g., for neuroinflammation and
synapse loss), digital spatial profiling, and synaptic and cognitive assessment. We will first complete
characterization of three prioritized LOAD strains as well as characterize a novel platform model LOAD3 (triple
homozygous for APOE4, hAβ and a humanized MAPT allele) with and without HFD (Aim 1).
Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of TAU is a hallmark pathology for LOAD and absent in our current
strains. Therefore, we will next evaluate four MAPT variants (N279K, P301L, R406W and S320F) that are
predicted to increase susceptibility to TAU pathology (Aim 2). Finally, no single LOAD model is expected to
represent the heterogeneity of human LOAD and we will therefore evaluate novel LOAD models based on
polygenic risk analysis (BDMC, Aim 3). The DMP will continue to synergize with the BDMC and Preclinical Test
Core (PTC) to develop more precise mouse models of LOAD and initiate preclinical testing."

 Latinas suffer disproportionately from late stage breast cancer (BC) diagnoses and worse post-diagnosis
quality of life relative to non-Latina Whites (NLWs), in part due to lower guideline-concordant screening.
Education+navigation (educate) approaches have offered Latinas community education to address
psychosocial barriers (e.g., fear) and navigated Latinas to free/low-cost breast cancer care. Our
transdisciplinary team has developed a promising empowerment+navigation (empower) approach that may
lead to greater BC screening among Latino networks. In the empower approach, Latinas who are non-adherent
to US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines learn about BC; are navigated to free/low cost
breast cancer care; and gain communication skills to promote BC screening throughout their networks.
 Our premise is that empowering non-adherent Latinas as breast health agents may lead to greater BC
screening among non-adherent Latinas and their networks than treating non-adherent Latinas as passive
recipients of education. The current proposal tests our premise and identifies “active ingredients” of the
empower approach.
 In Aim 1, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a federally qualified health center
(FQHC). This trial will build on our team’s current service projects to provide free/low-cost BC screening in the
FQHC, including leveraging its relationship with a community organization committed to leadership
development among Latinas. Among non-adherent Latinas, we will compare the effects of empower and
educate approaches on initial and repeat BC screening, in line with USPSTF guidelines.
 In Aim 2, we conduct an observational social network study. We will recruit network members through non-
adherent Latinas enrolled in our RCT. Among network members, we will compare the effects of empower and
educate approaches on initial and repeat BC screening across four years.
 In Aim 3, we will explore theoretical mechanisms of change that could contribute to intervention differences in
BC screening. For non-adherent Latinas’ BC screening, we will examine the mediating roles of greater BC
knowledge and motivation to be healthy role model. For network members’ BC screening, we will examine the
mediating role of non-adherent Latinas’ enhanced capacity to promote BC screening. Specifically, we will test
the independent effects of volunteerism in community BC initiatives, potential to “bridge” network members
with formal change agents (e.g., community health workers, navigators), acceptability to promote BC, feasibility
to promote BC, and BC promotion to network members.
 Our innovative, robust approach has direct implications for expediting the translation of promising community
interventions into practice."

The PI’s long-term objective is to improve the health and well-being of women and their children in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) through evidence-informed structural interventions, which will be made
possible by the training and mentorship provided from the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award. The
research proposed in this award will evaluate the effect of social policies that protect and support women on
reductions in intimate partner violence (IPV) and improvements in the health of their children under 5 years of
age in LMICs. This research will fill an important evidence gap. The IPV prevention literature has focused
primarily on interventions that target individuals, households, or communities, and the effect of social policies is
not well understood. During the K99 portion of the award, the PI will receive training and mentorship at
Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health from a cross-disciplinary mentoring team with
substantial experience mentoring early career investigators. Training areas will include child health, including
conceptual knowledge of potential pathways linking IPV to child health; causal mediation analysis; and
econometrics, which are methods commonly used to evaluate social policies. This training will enable the PI to
conduct three social policy evaluations in diverse LMIC settings. The first project will evaluate adoption of
national-level IPV prevention legislation on changes in IPV and improvements in child health. This work will
utilize Demographic and Health Survey data from 24 LMICs, linked with policy data collected from the World
Bank. The second project will evaluate the effect of availability of a cash grant for low-income, primarily female-
headed households in South Africa, on the health of children under 5 years of age. The project will perform a
causal mediation analysis to formally test if improvements in child health are mediated through reductions in
maternal IPV-related factors. This work will utilize longitudinal data from the South Africa National Income
Dynamics Study, which is a large population-based panel survey. The third project will evaluate the degree of
implementation of comprehensive IPV-prevention legislation in India on maternal IPV-related factors and child
health. This work will utilize longitudinal data from the India Human Development Survey, a large population-
based panel survey, linked with legislative data collected from an Indian legal advocacy group. The results of
these studies will substantially increase knowledge about the effect of social policies on reducing IPV and
improving child health across a wide range of LMIC settings. The training, mentorship, and research afforded
by this award will help the PI develop into an independent investigator who evaluates structural interventions to
improve the health of mothers and their children in LMICs. This proposed research furthers NICHD’s mandate
of improving child health by investigating and preventing harmful social and environmental causes, including
adverse childhood events."
10916567,"Project Summary and Abstract
Synovial joints are essential for body motion and quality of life. Their synovial cavity and lubricant-rich fluid
permit unhindered joint motion and function and provide tissue protection and nourishment. While these
aspects of synovial joint biology are well understood, little is known about how the cavity and its fluid actually
develop during embryogenesis. At early fetal stages, the limb skeletal primordia are composed of continuous
cartilaginous structures without joints. Joint development starts with appearance of an “interzone”, a tissue
made of mesenchymal cells expressing the growth and differentiation factor 5 gene (Gdf5). We previously
showed that Gdf5+ cell progenies produce most joint tissues over time and the synovial cavity forms in the
middle of the interzone. Because the interzone cells are initially attached to each other, the cavitation process
must involve their physical separation along the prospective articular line to facilitate the creation of a fluid-filled
cavity. Previous studies indicated that interzone cells produce hyaluronan (HA) around the cavitation time, and
this is accompanied by accumulation of a HA-rich matrix in local tissues. HA is a major component of
extracellular matrix and synovial fluid and plays important roles in tissue homeostasis. In my preliminary
studies, I found that just before cavitation onset, interzone cells in mouse embryo limbs express hyaluronan
synthase 2 (HAS2, ‘the HA synthesizer’) and transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2), a cell surface hyaluronidase
that specifically cleaves high molecular weight HA into intermediate and biologically-active fragments. I also
discovered that, morphologically, cavitation initiates with formation of microlumens along the prospective
articular line and is completed soon afterwards when the pockets coalesce to generate a single one synovial
cavity. This process is extremely rapid in the developing knee but is slower in digits. These and other novel
data lead to my central hypothesis that joint cavitation is brought about by convergence of diverse but
coordinated biological processes. Accordingly, Aim 1 is to determine the role of HAS2 and TMEM2 in joint
cavitation using genetically modified mouse models. I will conditionally delete Has2 and/or Tmem2 in interzone
cells (using Gdf5Cre mice) and subject resulting mutant embryos to detailed analysis. Aim 2 is to determine
cellular and molecular mechanisms of cavitation. I will investigate downstream signaling pathways in response
to changes in HA sizes and resulting interactions with cell surface CD44 receptor, regulating HA metabolism in
synovial joint development and long-term maintenance. The project will provide novel insights into mechanisms
underlying joint development and cavitation. In line with the K01 mechanism, the project will allow me to
acquire new expertise in skeletal developmental and molecular biology and to integrate it with my previous
training in bioengineering. This unique combination of expertise in two distinct but interrelated fields will allow
me to establish an independent career distinct from my mentors and create novel therapeutic tools to repair
and regenerate cartilage for the treatment of joint conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA)."

including sex differences in the immune response, and found differences in the resident (microglial) and
infiltrating (namely myeloid-derived suppressor cell) immune populations. While these initial observations were
made using transplantable mouse glioblastoma models generated from genetically engineered or carcinogen-
induced mouse models and validated in human samples, these models are not strongly representative of the
human disease, as they lack key drivers, including mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR,
namely EGFRvIII). Using in vivo electroporation approaches supported by the NCI IMAT program, more
representative GBM models have been generated using Mosaic Analysis with Dual Recombinase (MADR) and
Genome Editing of Synthetic Target Arrays for Lineage Tracing (GESTALT) technologies that leverage
concomitant expression of key oncogenes such as EGFRvIII and deletion of key tumor suppressors such as
NF1 and p53. The overall objective of this revision application is to enhance our program through the use of
these more representative glioblastoma models to determine sex-specific immune response effects. In Aim 1,
we will determine how the glioblastoma immune microenvironment is arranged as a function of the biological sex
of the tumor. In parallel with these benchmarking studies, Aim 2 will take an unbiased, hypothesis-generating
approach to determine how the neural cell composition of the tumor microenvironment is generated as a function
of the biological sex of the developing glioblastoma. The MADR-GESTALT will be applied to wild-type mice, as
well as Project 3-specific mouse models (junctional adhesion molecule-A) and the four-core genotype model that
separates chromosomal and gonadal sex. The short-term goal of this application is to enhance Project 3 of the
parent award and provide this new model for all projects through Core C, which houses experimental models.
The long-term goal of this project is to leverage these more representative glioblastoma models for future
functional and mechanistic studies on sex differences in glioblastoma."

The goal of the Engineering Core is to enable our Team members to surmount their most challenging
technological and engineering obstacles. There are many needs for engineering solutions in our proposal --
from behavioral apparatus to optical and electrophysiological rigs, to software for data acquisition and
analyses. Even the most technologically sophisticated of the research groups in our Team require special
assistance with engineering problems in order to achieve our ambitious aims. In the Center for Brain Science
at Harvard there is an existing Engineering Core that consists of
(a) an integrated laboratory to design, prototype, iterate, and produce custom devices for neuroscience
experiments
and
(b) Dr. Brett Graham, an engineer-neuroscientist who solves the most challenging engineering problems in the
user laboratories and trains young scientists to do this themselves.
By adding a dedicated staff engineer, the Engineering Core is able to support the team-based neuroscience
research proposed here. The specific aims are to implement engineering solutions to problems faced by the
Projects and other Cores. The Engineering Core will (a) design and build apparatuses to image rapidly
swimming larval zebrafish; (b) build rigs to record neural activity in larval zebrafish brains and hearts via
calcium imaging; and (c) further automate the connectomics imaging pipeline."
10916162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed phase 2 multicenter study will evaluate the small molecule selective CDK2/cyclin E inhibitor seliciclib
in patients with Cushing disease. This rare disease, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of
approximately 20,000 cases, results from an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary corticotroph
adenoma and predisposes patients to serious morbidities and increased mortality, mostly due to cardiovascular
complications. The current multimodal standard of care of surgical, radiotherapeutic, and medical treatments for this
endogenous hypercortisolism is usually not sufficient to control disease, and can lead to serious sequelae. There is a
clear unmet need for a medical therapy that directly suppresses pituitary corticotroph ACTH secretion and
normalizes cortisol levels in patients with this rare disease.
 Preclinical discoveries led to identification of seliciclib (R-roscovitine), which directly targets processes
promoting ACTH overproduction and the consequent hypercortisolism that underlies the excess morbidity and
mortality associated with Cushing disease. Preliminary data from an NIH-funded pilot phase 2 study indicate efficacy
of oral seliciclib without conferring adrenal side effects seen with current medications used for this disease. The
proposed expanded phase 2 multicenter trial has an adaptive design and will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two
of three doses/schedules of seliciclib in patients with de novo or recurrent Cushing disease. Up to 30 subjects will
be recruited, consented, and enrolled in consecutive dose cohorts through a collaborative effort among all five major
specialty pituitary centers in greater Los Angeles. Results of this trial will lay the foundation for additional trials of
this novel, highly targeted agent for treatment of this rare disease."
10916380,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rates of obesity for Black adolescents are among the highest of any racial or ethnic group in the United States,
and loss of control over eating (LOC; being unable to control what or how much one is eating) confers greater
risk for the development and maintenance of excess weight. LOC occurs in 25-44% of Black youth with
overweight and obesity, and Black youth eat more calories than their White counterparts during LOC episodes,
compounding the risk of excess weight gain. Nevertheless, existing explanatory models of LOC do not capture
the unique social contexts in which LOC occurs in Black youth, specifically the social nature of LOC in this
population and the role of minority-specific social stressors, such as racial discrimination. Using a synthesis of
qualitative data and ecological momentary assessment, this K23 proposal seeks to understand the social
contexts in which LOC occurs in Black adolescents, and specifically to probe the association between racial
discrimination and LOC. Focus groups (N = 4-5) will first be employed to gain a qualitative understanding of
the contexts in which LOC occurs, the specific language that Black youth use to describe it, and how it may be
linked to racial discrimination. Data from these groups will then be used to inform the EMA protocol in a second
set of adolescents with concurrent OWOB and LOC (N = 30), which will assess the interplay between
individual vulnerabilities for LOC and the larger social context, including racial discrimination. To carry out this
K23, I will receive mentorship from a leading team of experts in the areas of obesity and eating disorders,
health disparities, and ecological momentary assessment. This K23 will specifically facilitate my training in
culturally sensitive assessment of both LOC and racial discrimination, engagement in community-involved
research, and design and conduct of EMA research. This training will enable me to achieve my long-term goal
of becoming a leading independent investigator focused on understanding the large-scale contextual factors
that drive obesity related health disparities in racial and ethnic minority youth. Additionally, executing this K23
will also enable me to achieve two short-term goals: 1) submitting a subsequent R03 to create a culturally
adaptive measure of LOC that can be used to identify this problematic behavior in both research and clinical
settings and 2) integrating the findings from this K23 to create an intervention program targeting LOC and
obesity in Black adolescents in a subsequent R01. Therefore, in addition to aligning with NIH’s UNITE initiative
aimed at addressing structural racism and promoting health equity within biomedical research, this K23
proposal will serve as a launching point for my career as I leverage the training and research skills afforded by
this award to become a leader in the field of adolescent obesity prevention and intervention for racial and
ethnic minority youth."
10916397,"Despite the many initiatives designed to increase diversity among neuroscience researchers, the sad fact is that there has been a decline in the proportion and absolute numbers of minority researchers in the field of neuroscience. This failure is disturbing at a number of levels, but perhaps most notably highlights the inability of more senior investigators to effectively mentor junior investigators in their discipline. The loss of diversity among career scientists means a loss of diversity of thought, which in turn limits the generation of new ideas and scientific progress in the neurosciences. The inability of the multiple training programs to increase diversity is not an indictment of those programs, but rather it illustrates limitations in program approach. As a result, we propose to take a different route to addressing this problem. Our program is based on published findings that underrepresented individuals are lost in the system at transition points in their training, i.e., graduate school to postdoctoral training, postdoctoral training to faculty members, and tenure for young faculty. From self-report data, a principal contributing factor regarding attrition is that individuals feel isolated by not having meaningful ethnic and/or racial peer groups. In this R25 program we propose to take a longitudinal approach to mentoring in which we establish peer groups across each stage of professional development and utilize these peer groups to provide interactive mentoring within a community. We will recruit from across the nation a cohort of trainees from underrepresented backgrounds, consisting of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early stage investigators. For each of these cohorts we will provide longitudinal training in professional skills and mentoring. Through both mentor/mentee and peer-to-peer/peer-to-near peer mentorship structures, we will tailor professional development consistent with the progression of the trainee, while simultaneously creating a network of support amongst its participants. A key element of the program will be to teach the participants in the program how to be effective mentors themselves as a means to maintain the longitudinal development of program participants. Finally, we will provide access to high-level research cores and laboratories to enhance the scientific impact of the participants’ research. Participants will meet in Minnesota for one week each summer for professional training and guidance. For topics that span across career stage, the cohort will work together. There will also be specialized training sessions specific to academic rank. In addition to the on-site summer training, there will be two additional formal training events. In the fall, our trainees and mentors will meet at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting to participate in both professional development and a social event. In the winter, there will be an on-line video teleconference discussion following the group’s completion of an on-line professional development session. Overall, our goal is to fundamentally alter mentored training, and significantly enhance workforce diversity in the academic pursuit of research on neurological disorders."
10916406,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 As a predominantly rural state, Kentucky leads the nation in many pediatric and adult chronic and
environmentally-related diseases and ‘ranks nationally’ in low educational achievement. These adverse factors
combine to make Kentuckians especially unhealthy residents with a high prevalence of obesity, diabetes,
smoking, alcohol use, heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, etc. Many of these diseases are environmentally
related to poor nutrition, obesity, smoking, drug abuse, and work-place exposures. Kentucky also leads the
nation in the percentage of pediatric populations with special health care needs. Prior work has shown that
most adult diseases have their origin in childhood and some begin during fetal development, making childhood
the ideal time for intervention with the goal of improving health outcomes into adulthood.
 Improving healthcare outcomes and wellness in children is contingent on expanding and sustaining high
quality clinical research that includes diverse populations. Pediatricians at the University of Louisville (UofL)
with our Healthcare Partners serve a highly diverse patient population that includes the rural and urban poor, a
unique Appalachian community, refugees, and numerous ethnic minorities. To better serve this population, we
propose to build upon our current programs, expand our bidirectional community engagement efforts,
collaborate with other institutions on pediatric clinical trials through the ECHO IDeA Pediatric Clinical Trials
Network, and collaborate with ECHO cohort, INBRE, and CTSA sites to advance healthcare for children.
Education and training of local and regional faculty and staff is critical to sustain this initiative.
 The Kentucky ECHO-Pediatric IDeA Research Center (KE-PIRC), as part of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical
Trials Network, will make it possible for 1) rural and underserved infants, children and adolescents to
participate in clinical research; 2) junior investigators to be trained in clinical research and community
engagement, improve the health of both children and adults in Kentucky through this research, and develop
their academic career; and 3) the development of a regional network of partners to sustain this clinical
research initiative. The five primary focus areas are 1) pre-, peri- and postnatal outcomes; 2)
neurodevelopmental; 3) upper and lower airway disease; 4) obesity; and 5) positive health. These primary
focus areas are highly prevalent in Kentucky; therefore, KE-PIRC will enable strengthening current
collaborations and accelerate the development of new networks within the state through bidirectional
community engagement and feedback to support pediatric clinical research. Through these efforts, we aim to
improve the health outcomes of Kentucky children and adults and establish a local and national sustainable
pediatric clinical research workforce."

Lasting impacts: dynamic, fully natural bioprinted 3d human neurovascular biomimetic to study traumatic
 brain injury pathophysiology
Every year an estimated 2.5 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and many survivors experience
subsequent long-term cognitive deficits, sensorimotor impairments, and neuropsychiatric disability that result in
profound psychosocial and economic consequences for affected individuals. Acute and chronic effects of
neurotrauma represent leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and long-term disability in the US and around the
world. Although TBI is clearly defined neuropathologically, less well-defined is the relationship between the initial
impact and the resulting progression of trauma-related neurovascular pathology. This multidisciplinary multi-PI
proposal is responsive to the Trans-Agency Blood-Brain Interface Program (RFA-HL-20-021, R61/R33) and
builds on a longstanding collaboration between Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Boston University
School of Medicine, and the NIH/NIA-funded Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center to address
fundamental mechanisms underpinning acute and chronic effects of neurotrauma, including trauma-induced
microvascular injury and latent tau protein neurodegenerative pathologies associated with chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE). This project will develop and characterize a human in vitro perfusable neurovascular unit
(NVU) model with the overarching goal of identifying biomechanical triggers and molecular-cellular responses to
brain injury that determine the location, severity, and progression of traumatic microvascular injury (TMI), blood-
brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and phosphorylated tau proteinopathy. To accomplish this objective, this work will
leverage an existing BBB platform to biofabricate a 3D multi-cellular dynamic human NVU biomimetic with
perfusable endothelialized vasculature. The resulting optically clear NVU platform will enable systematic
interrogation of the human cerebrovasculature, including all human NVU cell types, with spatiotemporal control
and structure-function measurements in real-time. In the R61 phase, we will modify our existing 3D-printed BBB
model to include culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelia, pericytes, astrocytes,
and neurons. Effects of cellular composition, structure-function relations, fluid flow dynamics (intravascular,
interstitial), and culture incubation conditions on iPSC maturation will be investigated. In the R61 phase, we will
develop a platform-compatible injury instrument informed by computational simulations to match loads used in
in vivo animal studies. Embedded markers in the 3D-printed model will enable direct measurement and
visualization of time-varying strain during impact as a function of vascular, glial, and neuronal pathology and
compromised function (R33 phase). In addition, we will investigate molecular, cellular, and functional effects of
secondary damage post-TBI injury. Results will be informed by companion studies in experimental animals and
clinicopathological correlation with unique human brain specimens. This project will contribute to fundamental
understanding of brain injury biomechanics and relationship to acute and chronic effects of neurotrauma in the
human brain."
10916430,"Pathways for Authentic Teaching of Health Sciences (PATHS) is a five year project
designed to build health literacy knowledge and skills supported by a culturally responsive lens.
PATHS will provide teachers and students in historically underserved rural and urban Virgnia
communities with career awareness for the various educational trajectories and opportunities
provided by health professions (Medical Lab Sciences, PT and OT, Radiation Science, and
Dental Hygiene). PATHS will engage 60 secondary teachers (grades 7 through 12) over four
years in a model program that provides curriculum and pedagogical support (professional
development) guided by culturally responsive practices. Our aim is to support teachers and
ultimately students in learning about the skills and content of health professions, the impact of
social determinants of health (SDH), and to develop their ability to work with large data sets
through medical tools related to precision health. The curriculum tools will be web-based
modularized units to address five areas of health professions, SDH, and precision health and
will provide content-rich and inquiry-based exposure to careers and skills necessary for health
professions that are applicable to science, health/physical education, and career and technology
education classrooms. Teachers will participate in two summer institutes with support during
school-year follow-up sessions and virtual coaching. The project team along with the Virginia
Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) will support teachers and their students with sharing
their learning at Community Health Fairs, STEM Fairs, and other student research conferences.
 PATHS will include both formative and summative evaluation. The formative evaluation
will use a treatment-group-only approach to gauge the development and implementation of the
summer institute and curricular tools. The summative evaluation will involve a
quasi-experimental design to compare treatment and control teachers. Teachers will be
matched using propensity score matching to increase the design rigor. Surveys and focus group
interviews will be used to measure teacher and student learning and development of new skills.
If the PATHS program is successful in accomplishing these aims and increasing awareness and
understanding among students and teachers, we anticipate increased enrollment in programs in
STEM-H and an improved understanding of health care issues."
10916463,"SUMMARY
The maternal to zygotic transition is a universal step in animal development characterized by the
clearance of the maternally provided mRNAs and the activation of the zygotic genome. Indeed, these
two processes are intimately interconnected as maternal factors drive the activation of the zygotic
genes, and zygotic products actively target maternal mRNAs for deadenylation, repression and
clearance.
While recent studies have began identifying individual factors regulating mRNA stability and activation
of the zygotic genome, we lack major understanding on 1) the regulatory code (sequences, structures
and readers) that shapes genome activation and post-transcriptional regulation, 2) the mechanisms that
regulate protein output and genome activation, and 3) how different regulatory mechanisms are
integrated to instruct mRNA turnover, translation regulation and genome activation in the embryo. We
will combine massive parallel reporter assays to determine the regulatory activity of different sequences
in the early embryo, protein interaction maps (at the level of the DNA and RNA) to define the factors
that mediate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and novel imaging approaches to
determine how pioneer factors shape chromatin structure and in turn genome activation. Together
these experiments will define the mechanisms that trigger each of these steps in vivo and the gene
regulatory network that controls early vertebrate development.
This project is relevant for public health at different levels. First, from the standpoint of human disease
and cancer, pathways that control mRNA stability play an important role in aberrant oncogene
activation in cancer and are relevant to changes in cell fate where the cells need to transition to a new
program and remove the previous one through post-transcriptional regulation. Second, from the
standpoint of reproductive health, infertility is estimated to affect 15% of reproductive age women and
early pregnancy loss corresponds to 25% of all pregnancies with up to 70% in pregnancies after in vitro
fertilization. Understanding the mechanisms of zygotic genome activation and maternal mRNA decay
can provide fundamental insights in human infertility and tools to evaluate early loss of fertilized eggs.
The results we derived here will help us understand how gene expression is regulated in the early
embryo to trigger the activation of different developmental pathways during embryogenesis."
10912512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antibodies (immunoglobulins) are among the most widely used biologics for life science research and have
been the major driving force for disease diagnosis and therapeutics. Despite enormous efforts in the past,
high-quality research antibodies remain sparse, which have led to the poor reproducibility of numerous
scientific research papers and the immense costs associated with misleading literature. Major challenges
include poor quality of antibodies (e.g., low affinity and specificity), batch-to-batch variations, and difficulties in
production, bioengineering, manufacturing and storage. There is a pressing need to develop new technological
platforms to address these challenges and to provide new applications in biomedical research and drug
therapeutics.
Camelid single-chain VHH antibodies or Nanobodies (Nbs) are a compelling new class of antibodies
characterized by exceptionally high solubility and thermostability. We have recently developed a robust
pipeline for the discovery and characterization of high-quality antigen-specific Nb repertoires. This pipeline has
been extensively tested and optimized for a dozen of antigens with different structures and immune responses.
With this approach, a large cohort of high-quality conformational Nb binders can be identified.
Here we propose to developing innovative integrative technologies to revolutionize Nb discovery and
characterization. In parallel, we are keen to apply these methods and reagents to enable new biomedical
discoveries and therapeutics.
Development of the next generation Nb platform technologies will offer numerous exciting new possibilities in
biomedical research, disease diagnosis and therapeutics."

 Studies in both animal models and human cohorts have demonstrated broad impacts of prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) on immune function. We showed, for the first time that PAE results in a more severe and
prolonged course of inflammation in response to immune challenge in adulthood, which appears to have its
origins in a proinflammatory bias that is present from birth. Inflammation, increased gut permeability, and
changes in gut microbiota composition have been implicated in the pathogenesis of wide range of diseases/
disorders, including depression and anxiety. Notably, approximately 90% of individuals with Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorders (FASD) experience mental health problems at some point in their lives, with depression and
anxiety being the most common. Yet links between immune/inflammatory function and mental health outcomes
are not well studied in the FASD field, and to date there are no publications examining PAE effects on gut
structure, function, and microbiota composition, nor whether such changes may underlie alterations in immune
function. The present proposal will fill these gaps by exploring the complex interplay among PAE-induced
alterations in gut structure, function, and microbiota composition, immune function, and emotional dysregulation
(operationalized here as adverse mental health outcomes). The potential beneficial impact(s) of intervention
strategies including pharmacological treatments and fecal transplant will be explored, and a translational
experiment will investigate possible associations between PAE-induced emotional dysregulation and altered gut
microbiota composition in a human cohort. Our goal is to explore potential novel biomarkers of PAE and inform
future clinical strategies to improve health and well-being of individuals with FASD. Our Specific Aims are to:
1) Determine the effects of PAE on gut structure, function and microbiota composition and how these may affect
immune function and set the stage for risk for/resilience to emotional dysregulation; 2) Investigate the
effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in ameliorating PAE-induced alterations in gut structure, function,
microbiota composition, immune function, and emotional dysregulation; 3) Evaluate the efficacy of fecal
microbiota transplantation in ameliorating PAE-induced alterations in gut structure, function, microbiota
composition, immune function, and emotional dysregulation; and 4) Translate this work to a human cohort by
investigating associations among PAE-induced alterations in gut permeability, microbiota composition, and
emotional dysregulation in adults with FASD. Our working hypothesis is that PAE: impacts structure and
function of the gut barrier, leading to increased permeability to luminal products; causes a shift in gut microbiota
composition and altered signaling in the gut-brain axis; and together, these changes may be key drivers of the
early proinflammatory bias and lifelong perturbations in immune function that ultimately negatively impact mental
health status. This research will provide unique insight into factors underlying PAE-related risk and resilience."
10909891,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a devastating neurologic disorder caused by mutations in the
ABCD1 gene characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids that affects 1:17,000 individuals
in the U.S. Approximately 60% of male patients with ALD will convert to a devastating rapidly progressive
form of inflammatory demyelination that leads to incapacitation or death within 2-3 years (cerebral ALD). Age
of onset and phenotype varies even among individuals with the same mutation but a constant initial event in
cerebral ALD is blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption with migration of leukocytes to the brain. The precise
molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling BBB function during the course of ALD disease progress
remain poorly understood given lack of cellular or animal models that faithfully recapitulate cerebral ALD.
To address this critical knowledge gap, Dr. Musolino’s laboratory recently developed an ALD ex-vivo model
system using gene-editing strategies and human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Dr. Musolino’s initial
studies provide evidence that loss of ABCD1 directly impairs brain endothelial barrier integrity by increasing
TGFβ1 levels in a manner correlated with severe transcriptional downregulation of Claudin 5 and increased
permeability to small molecules. These alterations precede the accumulation of very-long chain fatty acids
suggesting that the BBB dysfunction is not a direct consequence of their accumulation. As with patients, in
addition to ABCD1 deficiency in this model, a second event, endothelial activation by inflammatory cytokines
or flow sheer stress, is necessary to increase the permeability to leukocytes. Building upon these strong
preliminary data Dr. Musolino’s hypothesizes that levels of ABCD1 expression in brain microvascular endothelium
controls transcriptional regulation of tight junction proteins via TGFβ1-regulated pathways and determines the
permeability to leukocytes during endothelial activation in a dose-dependent manner.
To test this hypothesis Dr. Musolino will probe the effect of ABCD1 deficiency upon the BBB by (1) Identifying
the molecular mechanisms governing tight junction disruption and increased permeability of ABCD1-
deficient brain endothelium (Aim 1), (2) Determining functional consequences of downregulation of tight
junction proteins and main regulatory pathways (Aim 2), and (3) Quantifying ABCD1 gene-dose effect on
endothelial barrier function (Aim 3). Upon successful completion of these studies Dr. Musolino will have
leverage the ability to model the impact of a single-gene mutation to unravel the mechanisms governing the
traffic of cells across the BBB in ALD setting forth a strategy to identify the molecular and cell biological
mechanisms underlying the conversion to cerebral disease, develop functional assays to test novel therapeutic
approaches, and inform the field of neuroinflammation."

novel intervention packages, (3) clinical trials design to test behavioral interventions, (4) collecting and
analyzing ecological momentary assessment data, and (5) designing and evaluating adaptive interventions,
and (6) career development will bridge my prior training in health communication (doctoral training, Cornell

term treatment adherence. Research: The goal of this K01 application is to identify OSA barriers and
facilitators, develop tailored health messages, and conduct a pilot study assessing their feasibility for improving
adherence to recommended OSA evaluation and treatment among transportation workers. I will design an
adaptive intervention to nudge and navigate transportation workers along their individual position on a
spectrum of readiness to change. Messages will be delivered via text messaging in a mobile health (mHealth)
approach. Messages will be designed to increase self-efficacy (i.e., belief in one’s ability to perform a
recommended behavior such as adhering to recommended OSA evaluation and treatment) in accordance with
Social Cognitive Theory. Future Directions: Results from this K01 will provide the necessary preliminary data
for my first R01 submission to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed intervention for improving OSA
evaluation and treatment among transportation workers."

Systems Biology has been an instrumental approach to overcoming challenges in biomedical research, where
solutions arise from interdisciplinary efforts, shared resources (data, tools, models, expertise) and integrative
analyses. The NCI Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) has created multiple consortia comprising interdisciplinary
communities of scientists who aim to integrate approaches, data, and tools to address important questions in
basic and translational cancer research. The Multi-Consortia Coordinating (MC2) Center for Cancer Biology will
work across programs to motivate engagement and collaboration, support resource sharing, and disseminate
knowledge and resources to the broader scientific community.
The MC2 Center will operate through three hubs. The Collaboration Hub will use evidence-based strategies to
catalyze interactions and new collaborations. An evaluation framework will be developed with quantitative and
qualitative metrics to ensure the center continuously improves its impact. Community engagement activities will
include working groups, special interest groups, DREAM Challenges, and Ideation Jams, all of which will have
mechanisms for ensuring inclusion and promoting diversity. To facilitate sharing of resources from DCB
programs, the Resource Coordination Hub will ensure all resources are findable, accessible, interoperable and
reusable (FAIR); it will identify or develop open and FAIR standards and best practices; provide training on
how to implement these standards and practices in the cancer research community; and provide tooling and
interfaces to facilitate resource sharing, curation, and deposition in public repositories. Finally, the Outreach
Hub will enhance dissemination of knowledge and resources through training materials to maximize utilization
of tools and short courses and workshops that bring concepts and resources from across the DCB programs
together, enabling the broader community to experience the power of an integrative interdisciplinary approach
to cancer.
The Cancer Complexity Knowledge Portal will continue to provide open access to all data, tools, and other
resources generated through the DCB and MC2, highlighting discoveries and enabling exploration into the
many valuable resources generated by DCB programs."
10910017,"Ensuring equitable vaccinations is critical for protecting all children against preventable and potentially
dangerous infections such as polio, diphtheria, and measles. Yet, numerous studies have highlighted low
vaccination coverage and timeliness, particularly among children from resource-limited settings. For example, in
Tanzania, only 68% of children receive all basic vaccines that are recommended in the first year of life. Reasons
for vaccination inequities are multifaceted; they include low caregiver knowledge about vaccines, and challenges
with health service delivery and access. Health service interruptions during the global COVID-19 pandemic have
further restricted opportunities for caregiver education, impacted vaccine access, and exacerbated vaccination
inequities. Approaches that optimally utilize limited health workforce capacity and rapidly evolving digital health
capacity for remote healthcare in resource-limited settings hold great potential for mitigating childhood
vaccination inequities. We recently completed (1) a Fogarty-funded study (R21TW010262) that demonstrated
the feasibility and efficacy of mobile phone-based reminders and conditional financial incentives for improving
the coverage and timeliness of childhood vaccinations, and (2) a community health worker (CHW) intervention
that was shown to be acceptable for mitigating caregiver knowledge gaps about childhood vaccines. Building on
this prior work and with support from Tanzania’s National Immunization and Vaccine Development program, we
propose to evaluate an integrated, community-based, digital intervention for promoting equity in childhood
vaccinations. The outreach and educational intervention, called ”Chanjo Kwa Wakati” (“timely vaccination”), is
targeted toward recent mothers and comprises a combination of CHW outreach and low-cost digital strategies
(autonomous mobile phone-based vaccination promotion messages, reminders, stockout notifications, and
incentive offers for timely vaccinations). In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effectiveness of Chanjo Kwa Wakati in
promoting the coverage and timeliness of childhood vaccinations in a Type I effectiveness implementation hybrid
trial. The trial will involve the staggered implementation of the intervention across catchment areas of 40 rural
health facilities in two predominantly rural regions of Tanzania with large numbers of un- or under-vaccinated
children. Vaccination outcomes will be analyzed for children born to 1200 women participating in the trial. In Aim
2, we will evaluate implementation factors associated with variations in intervention effectiveness, analyze the
cost effectiveness of the intervention, and develop an implementation blueprint to guide scale-up to other
settings. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of a machine learning approach for
proactively identifying children at risk of non- or delayed vaccinations and validate predictive models using
vaccination data gathered in Aim 1. Study findings will inform future implementations and scale up of Chanjo
Kwa Wakati, including potential interventions to improve vaccination equity for children living in rural, resource-
limited, or underserved communities in the United States."

The Stanford Molecular Imaging Scholars (SMIS) program is an integrated, 3-year cross-disciplinary
postdoctoral training program at Stanford University that brings together 30 faculty mentors from 13
departments in the Schools of Medicine, Engineering, and Humanities and Sciences. Molecular imaging (MI),
a noninvasive technique to visualize and quantify specific molecular and biochemical processes in living
organisms, has revolutionized medicine and biomedical research, and continues to expand its applications in
the detection, treatment, and management of cancer. Key to the continued advancement and growth of this
important field is the in-depth training of the next generation of cancer MI scientists. We propose to train 7
postdoctoral trainees per year (comprising 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year fellows). SMIS faculty mentors, and extensive
resources, provide a rich and diverse training environment spanning fields such as biology, physics,
mathematics, biocomputations/biomedical informatics, engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, cancer biology,
immunology, and medical sciences. The centerpiece of the SMIS program is the opportunity for trainees (with
PhD, MD, or MD/PhD degrees) to conduct innovative MI research that is co-mentored by faculty in
complementary research and clinical disciplines. SMIS trainees also engage in specialized coursework,
seminars, national conferences, clinical rounds, including ethics training in the responsible conduct of research,
and enhancement of research reproducibility. The 3-year program culminates with the preparation and
submission of an NIH grant proposal, in support of trainee transition to an independent career in cancer MI.
During the previous three award cycles, 39 trainees have entered the SMIS program; 5 are currently enrolled
and 34 have completed the program as of this writing. Those who have moved on are either in faculty or other
academic positions, or working in the biotechnology field. Demand for the SMIS training is high; we now
receive, on average, 10 or more applications per year from qualified candidates for 2-3 new trainee slots per
year. For the upcoming cycle, we propose an enriched SMIS program in the following aspects: expansion of MI
program area definitions to explicitly include cell tracking in vivo, immunotherapy and theranostics, and
computations; strategic selection of additional diverse mentors; improvement in all training and career
development components; expansion of female leadership for our training committee, grant writing proposal
activity, clinical exposure components, and recruitment of underrepresented minority candidates. The
continued goal of the SMIS program is to provide talented young researchers with the scientific and
professional educational/career development opportunities to become leaders in the field."

A decade ago, with the advent of next-generation sequencing of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium,
Karr et al. reported the first whole-cell model that synthesizes diverse mathematical approaches to predict a
broad spectrum of biological processes. Given the recent advancements in single-cell and spatial genomics,
along with the amassed cell atlas of embryogenesis, the creation of in silico models for entire mammalian
embryogenesis—a long-sought goal in computational biology—seems attainable. Nevertheless, two pivotal gaps
remain: (1) To capture the intricate and multi-faceted nature of embryogenesis, a cost-effective technology is
requisite—one capable of profiling entire embryos at a single-cell level with high temporal resolution in 3D space.
(2) To build the in silico model from the massive, high-dimensional datasets, we require powerful machine
learning techniques adept at directly learning complex data-driven models and at making non-trivial predictions.
In this proposal, I aim to construct the first-ever foundational in silico model of whole-embryo mouse
embryogenesis. To begin, I will utilize Ultima's innovative and cost-efficient “mostly natural sequencing-by-
synthesis” chemistry, combined with its ultra-high field of view wafer disc platform, to establish a large-scale 3D
multi-omics cell atlas of mouse embryogenesis from E6.5 to E16.5. This will involve one-day intervals and
incorporate a total of 50 million cells. The versatility of Ultima’s UG100 platform allows us to couple it with RNA
metabolic labeling, CRISPR-Cas9 based lineage tracing, and multi-omics, thereby producing a comprehensive,
high-definition, 3D cell atlas of mouse embryogenesis. Subsequently, I plan to devise sophisticated temporal
modeling techniques for learning multi-scale, multi-modal RNA velocity vector fields. Focusing on the spatial
aspect, I will devise a RNA signal-based segmentation technique for single-cell resolved spatial transcriptomics.
Computer vision methods, such as the Gaussian process, will be utilized to align serial 2D slices to reconstruct
the 3D embryos. To marry both temporal and spatial data dimensions, we will augment our RNA velocity vector
field model to encompass data-driven PDE (partial differential equations) models. Preliminary findings suggest
our model can accurately simulate the entire C. elegans embryogenesis starting from a single zygote, accounting
for protein expression, cell migration, and cell fate dynamics. In parallel, to harness existing vast datasets, we'll
integrate our PDE-like model with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (as used in ChatGPT). This integration
will equip our foundational model to seamlessly manage spatial, temporal, and multi-omics data. Prioritizing
interpretability and predictability, we will leverage differential geometry analysis as done in my previous Dynamo
framework. By merging cutting-edge technology with computational innovation, this project seeks to bridge
critical gaps in our understanding of embryogenesis, enabling a first-ever in silico model of mouse
embryogenesis that has the potential to revolutionize the study of developmental biology, disease mechanisms,
and therapeutic interventions."

Individuals with advanced glaucomatous damage have markedly impaired visual function resulting in a
decreased quality of life. This proposal will provide the longitudinal follow-up to fill in important gaps in our
knowledge about monitoring eyes with advanced open angle glaucoma (OAG). Monitoring of the disease in its
advanced stages is challenging because the visual field island shrinks to such an extent that only the central
visual field survives and measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness reaches a floor, after which
more thinning is not detectable. The overall objectives of this application are (i) to characterize the macular
structural (microvasculature and thickness) and functional changes in eyes with advanced OAG and (ii) to
develop novel models that can detect and predict progression in these eyes. The central hypothesis is that
novel statistical and artificial intelligence-based analyses of central visual field functional status and recently
developed macular optical imaging measurements will improve monitoring of disease in advanced OAG eyes.
There is a critical need for models that can predict glaucomatous progression in advanced OAG eyes and to
characterize longitudinal loss of macular structure and function in order to advise clinical decision making. The
central hypothesis will be tested by 3 Specific Aims. Aims 1 and 2 will develop and validate models for
detection of OAG progression using the central 10 degree visual field and characterize patterns of the
longitudinal changes in the central visual field and retina. Cluster-based progression methods will be applied in
vulnerable and less vulnerable zones of the 10-2 visual field. Nested multivariable linear mixed effects models
will be used to compare rates of macula structure (ganglion cell layer and vessel density) and functional
change (in eyes with Mean Deviation <-8 dB) and to characterize the relationships between baseline patterns
of visual field and structural loss and glaucoma progression while adjusting for inter-eye correlation. In Aim 3,
we will apply novel deep learning techniques to macular function and recently developed optical imaging
measurements to improve the prediction accuracy of glaucomatous progression in advanced disease.
Complex functional and structural tests in daily use by eye care providers contain hidden information that is not
fully used in the current analyses and advanced pattern recognition/machine learning-based analysis
techniques can find and use that hidden information. We will use mathematically rigorous unsupervised
techniques such as archetypal analysis and multimodal deep learning to discover patterns of defects and
assess the risk of changes in longitudinal series of perimetric and optical imaging data from >500 patients,
available in our NIH-supported glaucoma database. The proposed work is significant because it will lead to
development of more effective mathematically-based, validated methods of detecting OAG progression in eyes
with advanced disease. Moreover, it will reduce the cost of glaucoma care by identifying high-risk patients that
require more aggressive treatment, thus decreasing disability and reducing the burden of glaucoma blindness."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and
results in significant reduction in quality of life and functional status. Patients with COPD are 55 times more
likely to fall than patients without COPD, putting these patients at high risk of fall-related injuries and further
decrements in quality of life and health. This study will tackle the common and important problem of use of fall-
risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) among patients with COPD. This will be achieved by implementing and
evaluating a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention to reduce FRIDs use among community-dwelling, multi-
morbid adults with COPD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that poor communication and limited
shared decision making between prescribers, patients, and patient caregivers represent modifiable barriers to
deprescribing. Once these barriers are addressed, prescribers, patients and caregivers will be amenable to
informed deprescribing as part of this targeted intervention. In Specific Aim 1, I will use a national database to
assess commonly used FRIDs among patients with COPD, identifying FRID types and combinations
associated with the highest fall risk. In Specific Aim 2, I will interview patients with COPD, their family
caregivers, and clinicians (primary care providers, pulmonologists, pharmacists) to elicit barriers, facilitators
and key strategies to deprescribing FRIDs and enhancing shared decision making between clinicians and
patients. In Specific Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot randomized trial, testing a pharmacist-led deprescribing
intervention, adapted using findings from Specific Aims 1 and 2. I will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and
appropriateness of the intervention using semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires. I will also
explore the preliminary efficacy of the intervention compared to usual care for the primary outcome of FRID
discontinuation. This pilot trial will provide preliminary data for a future R01-funded hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial. This research is innovative in that: 1) no prior study has evaluated an intervention to
facilitate deprescribing FRIDs among patients with COPD; 2) this intervention includes family caregivers, who
provide informal medication management to patients; and 3) this project uses a pulmonary clinic-based
pharmacist as a conduit to improve communication and shared decision making among patients, caregivers
and clinicians. My learning objectives are to learn a) advanced statistical methods to evaluate fall risk among
patients with COPD, b) training on COPD therapeutics and fall risk assessment, c) behavioral intervention
optimization, adaptation and assessment, and d) behavioral clinical trials design for future intervention trials.
My long-term career goals are to evaluate and disseminate evidence-based interventions to improve
medication management and healthcare delivery for multi-morbid adults with COPD."
10914070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: By examination of cancer patient genomic datasets, through the cBioPortal, we identified a new
class of recurrent mutations in genes encoding histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. This supports an underlying
premise, supported by rigorous publications from many groups including ours, that mutations of gene regulatory
machinery, including histones are oncogenic drivers of human cancer. Many of these mutations affect residues
of the histone folds important for the interactions among histones required for integrity of the histone octamer.
Others may affect histone interactions with the chromatin modeling machinery. Histone fold mutations are found
in 4% of lung (commonest tumor in US) and colorectal tumors, 6% of head and neck and 12% of bladder cancer.
Histone mutations are subclonal. Tumors with histone mutations were significantly more likely to harbor
mutations of oncogenic signaling molecules and tumor suppressive epigenetic regulators, suggesting that
histone mutations augment the effect of other oncogenic lesions. Preliminary data: We characterized a
recurrent mutation that changed amino acid 76 of histone H2B from glutamic acid to lysine (H2BE76K). This
mutation disrupts the interaction of the H2B/H2A dimer with the H3/H4 tetramer, preventing formation of the
histone octamer. Our Cancer Discovery paper showed that H2BE76K inhibits formation of nucleosomes in vitro
and in yeast. Expression of H2BE76K in human cells disrupts chromatin structure, activates gene expression,
promotes cell growth, and cooperates with PI3KCA to transform breast epithelial cells. We hypothesize that
mutations that disrupt histone structure create millions of dysfunctional nucleosomes. These may deregulate
gene expression and drive cancer development by creating new sites of “open” chromatin with loss of
nucleosome-mediated gene repression, as well as by altered interactions with regulators of chromatin and gene
expression. Approach: We will use cell and mouse models and epigenome profiling to characterize the
oncogenic mechanisms of histone mutations, particularly in the transformation of lung cells, through three
specific aims: 1) Elucidate mechanisms by which histone fold mutations alter cell growth, gene expression and
chromatin structure. 2) Determine how histone fold mutations cooperate with co-occurring oncogenes and tumor
suppressive chromatin regulators in cell and animal models. 3) Characterize the effects of histone mutations on
tumor heterogeneity and response to therapy. Novelty: This proposal explores a new class of cancer-driving
mutations to uncover novel mechanisms of oncogenesis by chromatin disruption. We will use the latest versions
of gene editing to engineer histone mutations into cells, analyze tumor cells with advanced technologies for
genome wide analysis of chromatin states and create new animal models. Impact: We will focus on lung cancer,
where we estimate up to 10,000 patients/year will have tumors with histone mutations. The long-term objective
of these studies is to uncover new mechanisms of oncogenesis that contribute to tumor progression,
heterogeneity, and therapy resistance, with the aim of finding new targets and pathways for intervention."

Our multidisciplinary, multi-country team of implementation science experts propose to adapt, implement, and
evaluate the “Integrating HIV and hEART health in South Africa” (iHeart-SA) program that incorporates
hypertension (HTN) and diabetes (DM) screening and treatment for people living with HIV (PLWH). SA is the
epicenter of the HIV pandemic worldwide with over 7 million PLWH, of whom ~5 million are treated with anti-
retroviral therapies (ART). ART rollout has two relevant repercussions: first, PLWH now have approximately
twice the risk of developing HTN, DM, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); and second, the success of ART
programs creates a corresponding mandate to deliver integrated, high-quality, sustainable treatment strategies
to detect, treat, and control HTN and DM in HIV care. There are patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers to
achieving these goals; but, there are also evidence-based interventions to address them, and we have
extensive experience applying these to transform care for CVD co-morbidities in South Africa and India. We
have determined the barriers to CVD care and reviewed the literature to select a package of interventions
proven successful in randomized controlled trials, including: use of non-clinician care coordinators to support
treatment documentation and quality improvement (QI); incorporation of home monitoring to enhance self-
management; decision-support tools to facilitate treatment initiation and modifications; and monthly audit /
feedback meetings to support continuous QI. We will use the EPIS framework and partner with government,
academic, facility, and community stakeholders to guide the project by: Exploring (engaging stakeholders in
human-centered design to co-adapt the intervention package to align with local capacity, opportunities, and
motivations, Aim UG1); Preparing (strengthening capacity in implementation science, Aim UG2);
Implementing and evaluating the intervention package via a stepped wedge cluster trial and assessing both
implementation (e.g., reach, adoption, fidelity) and effectiveness (e.g., controlled blood pressure [primary
outcome] among PLWH and HTN), Aim UH1; measuring Sustainability and costs after 24 months (where 12
months were spent transferring delivery from study to local staff (Aim UH2); and developing a strategy to scale
up to rural clinics and nationally (Aim UH3). The overall goal of this project is to employ rigorous empirical
methods to develop and test care innovations that expand the scope of HIV care in a sustainable, scalable,
and impactful way. We will employ an achievable milestone plan to deliver high quality outputs, including:
continued stakeholder relationships and co-ownership of the study over the project period; completion of three
PhDs in implementation science; and disseminating findings via high-impact publications and presentations.
We will also participate in NHLBI’s collaborative multi-institution network designed to strengthen research
methods and impacts across all sites, and to advance training of the next generation of scientific leaders."

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/ CPPS), are common, costly, and debilitating syndromes characterized by persistent bladder and/or pelvic pain, and urinary symptoms, such as urgency and frequency. The cause of these conditions, together referred to as urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS), is unknown and their pathophysiology is poorly understood,making treatment challenging. Although several therapies have been proposed for UCPPS, none has been found
to work consistently in all patients and each is either invasive or prone to significant side effects. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are clearly needed. One such promising, but understudied, approach is dietary exclusion. This approach is supported by findings from one small single-arm trial (n=10), two case reports, our recent Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain 1 (MAPP-1) Research Network case-crossover study, and several patient surveys indicating that a large proportion of patients believe that diet triggers their flares. However, as patient-reported triggers are numerous and wide-ranging (up to 144 candidates), identification of one common diet suitable for all patients has proven challenging. Elimination diets are also difficult to implement and test because of the large number of possible food triggers that need to be eliminated in the “elimination” phase, the large number that need to be re-introduced in the “re-introduction” phase, and the challenges of blinding elimination diets. Therefore, tools to personalize these diets are urgently needed. In pilot trials of patients with migraines, Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and asthma, researchers have
observed significant symptom reductions following exclusion diets informed by food-specific IgG antibody concentrations. This approach is promising because it reduces the time, complexity, and burden of dietary exclusion, while simultaneously increasing its chance of success and potential for rigorous blinded evaluation. Food-specific IgG antibodies are also plausible candidates to inform UCPPS therapy because they act by biologic mechanisms implicated in UCPPS pathology (e.g. mast cell degranulation and histamine release) and in a “delayed” time frame (hours to days) consistent with patient-reported food trigger experiences. However, before we can initiate a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of food-specific IgG antibody-informed exclusion diets for UCPPS, additional empirical evidence is necessary to support this approach. For many conditions for which biomarker-informed exclusion diets have shown preliminary efficacy, researchers first demonstrated a greater likelihood of having food-specific IgG antibodies in patients than controls. We have also generated promising pilot data in a small sample of 10 UCPPS patients (100% had food-specific IgG antibodies
compared to 15-33% of historical controls). In this R01, we plan to build on these promising findings by formally testing whether UCPPS patients have greater food sensitivity than controls, using existing plasma samples and clinical phenotyping data from 100 cases and 100 controls from the MAPP-1 study."

The increasing number of bubonic/pneumonic plague cases globally (2010-2018), including the U.S., with a
~18% case fatality rate may reflect climate changes and a rodent carrier range shift. The 2017-18 plague
outbreak in Madagascar with ~2400 cases (>75% pneumonic) and ~9% causalities has led WHO (April 2018) to
intensify the need for developing new generation subunit and live-attenuated plague vaccines. This need is
exemplified by deadly plague cases in China (2019) and Congo (2020 with a 35% fatality rate). Y. pestis’ (Yp)
ability to persist in dead hosts to resurge after years of silence, existence of antibiotic-resistant strains that occur
naturally or have been intentionally developed, and no FDA-approved plague vaccine, is fearsome. Two-
component subunit vaccines composed of capsular antigen F1 and a T3SS component and effector LcrV (low
calcium response V antigen), which only generate a humoral immune response, provide variable protection in
African green monkeys (AGM) and generate poor T cell responses in humans. Such vaccines will not be effective
against Yp strains lacking F1 or possessing LcrV variants. Since the cellular immunity is also critical for
protection, we focused first on identifying new virulence genes of Yp and then to delete them in combination to
develop novel live-attenuated vaccine (LAV) strains. Two such LAVs were 100% attenuated in inducing
bubonic/pneumonic plague in mice/rats and generated long-term humoral and cellular immune responses to
provide 100% protection to rodents against developing plague. No clinical symptoms of the disease or
histopathological lesions were noted either during immunization or when the vaccinated animals were
subsequently exposed to Yp CO92 in a more stringent pneumonic plague model. Therefore, further
immunological characterization of these mutants and their testing in higher animals, such as cynomolgus
macaques (CM) and AGM, will provide a rationale for future clinical studies. There is a precedent for using a
LAV against plague (EV76 strain) in humans. However, this vaccine is reactogenic, represents a spontaneous
mutant, and causes disease in patients with over iron load. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate efficacy and immune
responses of two vaccine candidates generated from Yp CO92 (biovar Orientalis) against other Yp biovars
(Antiqua and Medievalis), the F1-minus mutant of CO92, and Yp CO92 with LcrV variants, in bubonic and
pneumonic mouse models. Our data with the mutants indicated a role of IL-17 (a Th17 cytokine), Th1-IFN-γ, and
antibodies, in protection. In Aim 2, we will study the mechanistic basis of this protection (one chosen mutant) by
using RORt-/- mice, which lack Th17 cells, as well as IFN-γ and IgA k/o mice, to discern their links to neutrophil
recruitment and mucosal immunity, to combat Yp infection in bubonic/pneumonic plague models. In Aim 3, CM
and AGM will be used with one mutant to demonstrate its short- and long-term efficacy in causing bubonic and/or
pneumonic plague as well as reactogenicity. The correlates of protective immunity will then be established.
These innovative mechanistic/translational approaches will result in effective new generation plague vaccines."

The ability to sense dynamic changes in the cellular environment and translate that information into rewired
biomolecular interactions forms the backbone of cellular signal transduction. Despite significant interest and
investment in methods capable of detecting and quantifying protein-protein and other protein-biomolecule
interactions, the most commonly employed methods solely map interactions in non-physiologic environments
outside of cells where many important factors contributing to the interactions under study are lost. These methods
are particularly poorly suited to study signaling events in cells that rely on the cellular architecture and chemical
environment in order to form and function. Therefore, new methods are needed to quantitatively map protein
“social networks” inside of living systems. Here we propose to develop and validate several complementary light-
dependent proximity profiling platforms capable of detecting protein interaction dynamics in live cells with high
spatial and temporal resolution, as well as minimal perturbation to the cellular environment. We will accomplish
this goal through three interconnected aims that are supported by preliminary data and our previously published
work with an intracellular photoproximity profiling platform. First, we will synthesize and test tunable
photoproximity chemical probes to map protein complexes at nanometer scale inside of cells. In parallel, we
propose to test potentially more efficient catalytic photoproximity profiling platforms for increased resolution of
low abundance macromolecular complexes inside of cells. Finally, we propose to apply these platforms to study
the dynamic sensing of altered metabolic and redox stress inside cells through the integrated antioxidant and
unfolded protein response pathways. These proximity profiles will enable drafting of the first quantitative,
comprehensive maps of the integrated stress response in cells, which will identify points of intervention for
diseases such as cancer, aging and neurogenerative disorders. Furthermore, the methods and proximity profiles
developed herein will also be widely useful to the biological community for application to diverse questions in
intracellular signal transduction."

 The vision for the UAB Pilot Center for Precision Animal Modeling (C-PAM) is to become a national
resource to efficiently and cost-effectively analyze pathogenicity of gene variants identified in patients with rare
disorders and to produce variant-specific models to pursue disease mechanisms and targeted therapeutics.
Many potential disease-causing variants are being identified in patients due to the availability of whole genome
sequencing technologies. The pace of identifying variants is now far outpacing the ability for individual labs to
confirm their pathogenicity. Following identification, these variants require assessment and annotation to
separate variants of no impact and simple sequencing and mapping errors from those that are causative of the
disease. This is a complex problem to address requiring interdisciplinary approaches and a concerted effort to
evaluate the variant. Part of this effort is to generate and analyze informative animal models. C-PAM has
assembled a team of highly collaborative individuals with expertise in basic science, computational and data
sciences, human genetics, clinical diagnosis, and animal model generation to tackle this problem. The C-PAM
team has established a pipeline in which community nominated variants will be thorough analyzed using an
innovative bioinformatic toolkit generated by the C-PAM Bioinformatics Section. If selected, the variant will be
modeled in animals by the C-PAM Disease Modeling Unit. These new models will be evaluated for human
disease relevance by the C-PAM Pre/Co-clinical Section. Once generated, C-PAM will facilitate the formation of
expert collaborations to utilize the detailed informatic analyses and the animal resource that will be distributed
through the C-PAM Resource and Services Section to advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis, to
ascertain efficacy of novel or repurposed therapeutics, and to contribute to improved human health. For C-PAM
to work efficiently and achieve its goals, the efforts of each component in the Center must be coordinated. This
is the job of the C-PAM Coordination Section (CS) that will provide the overall organizational structure for the
Center. It will synchronize the activity of each of the C-PAM components and provide management,
administrative support, and leadership to ensure C-PAM components are working toward a common set of
objectives. The CS will assemble oversight committees to prioritize nominated variants, to select animal models
for generation, to evaluate the performance and impact of C-PAM, and to make strategic plans for the Center to
fulfill its vision."

The Preclinical/Co-Clinical Section (PCS) provides a critical link between affected individuals and referring
clinicians and the C-PAM. Guiding principles are 1) to maintain a dialog with affected individuals and referring
clinicians to ensure that adequate information is available to prioritize creation of a model and to validate the
model, and 2) to engage affected individuals and referring clinicians as partners, providing updates on progress
in a responsible manner. We expect to receive nominations for creation of an animal model from several ongoing
programs at UAB that have an existing queue of genomic variants for analysis, as well as from sources outside
of UAB. The PCS will provide a secure web-based gateway for accession of clinical information, obtained with
the informed consent of participants. The PCS team will review this information and summarize it in a PhenoTips
entry. This in turn will be used to generate a Variant Phenopacket (VPP), which will include human phenotype
ontology terms related to the affected individual's phenotype along with relevant genotypic information. There
will also be the capacity to obtain and store biological samples, such as blood, urine, saliva, and surgical
specimens, if needed. The VPP will be passed onto the Bioninformatics Section for further analysis, leading
ultimately to information to guide a decision by the Steering Committee of whether to create a model. Once a
model is made, the PCS will work together with the Disease Modeling Unit to provide co-clinical assessments.
If the model is one that might demonstrate a phenotype similar to that seen in the affected individual, the PCS
will help to validate the model phenotype in light of the clinical phenotype. Often this will require going back to
the affected individual or referring clinician for additional phenotypic information. In other cases, the model will
address cellular function altered by the genomic variant. Further validation of this finding might require additional
studies in tissue obtained from the affected individual. The PCS will also work with the Disease Modeling Unit
in studies of potential therapies. In some instances, a drug or substance might be identified that is recognized
as having potential therapeutic benefit. In other instances, the creation of the model might enable a drug
discovery effort. In either case, the PCS will work with the Disease Modeling Unit to assess potential therapies.
If results shed light on the pathogenicity of a variant or on the availability of a possible treatment, these will be
reviewed by a Clinical Curation Committee before any information is shared with the referring physician.
Ultimately, if approved by the committee and the affected individual has opted into learning of such information,
the PCS physician will communicate with the referring physician. Otherwise, general information on research
progress will be maintained on the C-PAM portal to keep the affected individual and referring physician apprised
of general progress."

variants identified as part of rare disease programs to provide a definitive diagnosis, evaluate specific variant
impact, and support therapeutic target identification. C-PAM will accomplish this through application of
computational, cellular, and clinical methods to assist in the generation of informative animal models. As a
component of this Center, the C-PAM Bioinformatics Section (BIS) will provide the computational tools, methods,
and analyses supporting the necessary and diverse set of visualization, exploration, and analysis use cases. It
supports internal and external C-PAM users with varying skillsets and interests and supports use cases related
to both human and animal model data and the intersection between them. By tailoring existing software
infrastructure, computational approaches, and analytical capabilities, the BIS will provide the C-PAM
computational framework (portal, repository and analyses).
 The BIS will: support decisions regarding selection of variants to model (Phases I, II), predict phenotypic
outcomes (Phase III), collect and disseminate data from the animal model generation process (Phases IV, V),
share data and methods with C-PAM sections and the biomedical community (Phases VI, V), and overall
support impact evaluation for C-PAM. The outward facing C-PAM portal (Aim 1) will provide data access
and analytics and a unifying view of the entire Center including an accounting of the Center's holdings and access
to data and tools. Our data schema is completely data driven and highly data condensing, allowing customization
and on-demand updates as underlying data sources update. Additionally, it is designed to support
the natural workflow of C-PAM, for example by providing users with the ability to add notes
and curations, ensuring knowledge is not lost to external notepads or apps. Also building out existing
capabilities (Aim 2), the portal will integrate a diverse and distributed set of tools and data stores supporting
consideration, prioritization, and selection of variants for model organism study. This suite of
features will support the user's ability to predict and understand phenotypic outcomes of the genetic
perturbations generated by C-PAM. Finally, the BIS will support and house cutting-edge computational research
for selection and prioritization of novel or repurposed drug targets for therapeutic decision-making (Aim 3).
Application of these innovative machine learning and other computational methodologies will
support comprehensive variant damage and drug prediction preclinical hypothesis testing and prioritization.
 Across all of these aims the BIS will support the needs of diverse stakeholders, including clinicians,
patient groups, and cellular, molecular, and computational biologists. Through the approaches outlined, the BIS
will support the C-PAM goals of providing efficient and cost-effective models that can be used to help patients or

model characterization and preclinical treatment. The Resource and Service Section (RSS) supports C-PAM by
working in several areas of the pipeline to support the Center's mission including Phases IV: Services and
Shipment, V: Phenotyping, and VII: Special Services. Importantly, the RSS provides access to enhanced
services in Phase VII that are difficult to accomplish in most individual labs and are not readily available through
any other mechanism, or are prohibitively costly in terms of both expense and/or time impediments. The RSS
provides a bridge between all other components in C-PAM and outside investigators. We are a checkpoint that
helps ensure quality control, data management, and data input into our Bioinformatics database and C-PAM
Variant Portal. We archive and distribute models created by the DMU to NIH-sponsored national repositories
and/or outside investigators. We facilitate high level, detailed scientific dialogues between our team and both
external and internal investigators and we provide animals for phenotype assessment in collaboration with the
DMU and the Pre/Co-clinical Section. The goal of these conversations is to lead to new collaborations resulting
in detailed secondary phenotyping through UAB Core Resource facilities that validates variant pathogenicity,
provides new biological insights, and promotes targeted therapeutics testing of the animal models generated by
the C-PAM pipeline. The overall aims of the UAB C-PAM RSS are: Aim 1) Acquire and document mutant animal
model strains and biomaterials from the Disease Modeling Unit. This will include rodents (mice and rats),
zebrafish, and C. elegans. Aim 2) Characterize, expand, and distribute resources created by the UAB C-PAM.

HIVs have established themselves in human populations (HIV-1 group M, HIV-1 group O, HIV -2 groups A and
B) outbreaks, there were many other lesser ones, namely HIV-1 group P and N and HIV-2 groups C through I,
indicating that SIV transmissions to humans are not infrequent events. More than 40 SIVs exist in the wild in
non-human primates (NHP) in West and Central Africa and human encroachment into their habitat continues to
accelerate, suggesting that potential for the emergence of new human pathogens still exists. Thus, we need to
be vigilant and conduct viral surveillance. In this context, animal models that can permit testing of SIV cross-
species transmission and evolution are needed. For this purpose, the new generation hu-mice that harbor a
transplanted human immune system appear to be highly suitable. In work centered on SIV progenitor viral
evolution into HIVs, we and others found that hu-mice are susceptible to SIV-chimpanzee (SIVcpz) the progenitor
of HIV-1 and SIV-sooty mangabey (SIVsm) the progenitor of HIV-2. More recently, we discovered that hu-mice
are also permissive to macaque-derived SIVmac251, a widely used virus in NHP studies in the context of HIV
research. However, thus far no previous studies examined the human infection potential of more primitive SIVs
in the wild. Here we will evaluate two SIV strains, namely SIVrcm from red capped mangabeys and SIVmnd2
from mandrils, viruses from two distinct NHP species. These were previously studied in their native hosts wherein
they display high viral loads but are non-pathogenic. These two viruses are genetically linked to SIVcpz which is
the progenitor for HIV-1. While a full comprehensive study of these in vivo will be a complex undertaking, here
in this R21 grant of a limited budget and scope, we propose to start with the following simpler initial goals.
Aim 1: Investigate the potential for zoonotic transmission and sustained human infection by select SIVs, SIVrcm
and SIVmnd2 using a humanized mouse model.
Aim 2: Characterize key pathogenic attributes of the human adapted viruses for cell tropism, helper CD4 T cell
loss and capacity for sexual transmission.
Knowledge gained from here will shed light on the initial steps in cross-species transmission."

Recently the STRONG-HF trial exceeded initial expectations by demonstrating that heart failure re-admissions
can be reduced by 44%, and patients can be up-titrated on their medications remarkably faster, but only by
increasing the number of outpatient visits by four to monitor key molecular biomarkers such as NT-proBNP and
potassium. Given the strain already on the health-care system, a major need that has been directly requested by
cardiologists is to achieve STRONG-HF outcomes but in a more decentralized care format. If STRONG-HF care
can be implemented in largely ambulatory/home setting, it could represent the next largest leap forward in the
management of newly diagnosed heart failure. Kilele Health has performed rigorous discovery work to confirm
strong significance for remote post-discharge monitoring of heart failure patients: in interviews of 20
cardiologists 100% cited value for remote monitoring of NT-proBNP for treatment efficacy and 90% cited value
for remote monitoring of potassium for adverse events caused by treatment. Kilele Health’s goal is to develop
a factory-calibrated continuous multi-modal molecular monitor of NT-proBNP and potassium for heart failure
patients during the first 30-90 days after discharge. Kilele’s investor-vetted financial modeling points to a $4.1B
market opportunity in heart failure alone. For comparison, this is even larger than the initial beach-head market
for glucose monitors in Type 1 diabetes ($2.6B). The proposed device is highly innovative, as it would be the
first ever continuous molecular monitor for cardiovascular diseases. Continuous remote molecular monitoring
will shift current clinical practice, with automatic data to the patient and to electronic health-care records, not
only improving patient outcomes (greater accuracy, more timely) but reducing the enormous $16B annual costs
of heart failure readmissions. The investigators are exceptionally prepared due to their recent breakthroughs
in creating robust aptamer sensors for molecular monitoring, existing relationships with glucose monitor
companies, enagement with clinical experts in cardiovascular disease, and due to decades of experience for
Kilele’s leadership in commercializing diagnostic devices. The team will achieve the Phase SBIR 1 overall
objectives through the following three aims: Aim 1 – create a skin-insertable sensor strip that can measure both
NT-proBNP and potassium; Aim 2 – demonstrate a ‘factory-calibrated’ batch fabrication process for the sensors;
Aim 3 – perform at least 3 day testing in rats with a stretch goal of >10 days with >0.7 blood correlation. The
expected outcomes of this work will enable Phase 2 SBIR support to pursue both human testing, wearable
product development, and initiation of the regulatory approval process."

An emerging radiotherapy (RT) modality that utilizes ultra-high dose rate, known as FLASH-RT, has
demonstrated unprecedented ability for improving RT therapeutic ratio in preclinical studies and early clinical
cases. Because of lack of appropriate image-guidance technologies, these studies have been limited to superficial
irradiations and simplistic cases where monitoring of delivered dose is permissible using existing methods. This
severely handicaps the prospects of FLASH-RT and largely limits its promising impact for deep seated tumors,
which constitute most of RT cancer cases. It is widely recognized that currently used dosimetry technologies fall
short of providing the necessary guidance to deliver FLASH-RT in a practical clinical setting without exposing
the patient to tremendous risks that go far beyond the traditional RT delivery. Undoubtedly, there is an unmet
need to develop in vivo image-guidance techniques to safeguard FLASH-RT accurate delivery. We hold that these
challenges can be resolved by refining the emerging technology of ionizing radiation-induced acoustic imaging
(iRAI), which can be intrinsically paired with FLASH-RT delivery systems. iRAI is based on the known
thermoacoustic phenomenon in radiation physics, where acoustic waves are generated from thermoelastic
expansion of a substance following absorption of penetrating pulsated high energy radiation. Building upon our
multi-institutional multidisciplinary team with expertise in ultrasound (US) imaging, RT physics, data analytics,
and our promising preliminary results, we hypothesize that: (1) a dual-modality imaging system comprised of
iRAI and US (iRAI-US) can simultaneously image both tissue morphology and 3D dose deposition during
FLASH-RT delivery with high spatio-temporal resolutions; and (2) machine learning based reconstruction and
anomaly detection can effectively improve imaging quality and mitigate errors, respectively, for clinical
translation. Therefore, in this project we aim to exploit the technological potentials of iRAI-US and machine
learning for developing an image-guidance platform for effective and safe FLASH-RT delivery. We will
demonstrate its efficacy with electron and proton beams using computer simulations (in silico), tissue mimicking
phantoms, and relevant preclinical in vivo models. Specifically, we will (1) develop and test a dual-mode imaging
system for 3D radiation-acoustics dosimetry and US imaging for FLASH-RT; (2) evaluate the in vivo
performance of iRAI-US dual imaging during electron and proton FLASH-RT deliveries; and (3) adapt and
improve iRAI volumetric representation, temporal resolution and error detection for FLASH-RT using deep
machine learning algorithms (DeepRAI) towards effective clinical implementation.
Impact: Our proposed image-guided FLASH-RT, once validated, will offer a practical, robust, cost-effective,
and unique system for safeguarding FLASH-RT delivery. These advancements will address the current
challenges impeding the clinical translation of FLASH-RT and enable achieving its promise of limiting
radiotherapy toxicity to normal tissues and thereby improving cancer patient care and quality of life."
10908584,"T cell receptor mimic (TCRm) mAbs. TCRm mAbs represent a new class of mAbs, structurally identical to
traditional mAbs. However, while traditional mAbs recognize 3D conformational structure of a surface protein,
TCRm mAbs recognize peptides (9-10 amino acids) derived from intracellular proteins, displayed on cell
surface by MHC class I molecules, the complexes traditionally recognized by TCR. This allows an antibody to
have access to vast majority, truly tumor-specific antigens, most of them are intracellular proteins. The
advantages of mAb therapy are well known that include their high target specificity, high efficacy, limited side
effects, prolonged half-life, availability, low cost, and infrequent dosing. In addition to the immune effector
functions of a mAb, mAb can also serve as antigen-specific vehicles that can deliver more potent cytotoxic
agents such as toxins, drugs, or radiation. Finally, mAbs can be engineered into chimeric antigen receptors
or bi-specific antibodies in order to enhance the specificity and the potency of T cell therapy.
This project aimed at developing novel TCRm mAbs specific for two important, validated and tumor-specific
antigens, as described below. Combining the best inherent features of both TCR recognition and the flexibility
and potency of the mAbs as drugs, the new TCRm mAbs could offer a potent, controllable and widely
applicable therapy.
1. Developing TCRm mAb to HPV-E7-derived epitope in the context of HLA-A*02:01. Human papilloma
virus (HPV) causes hundreds of thousands of cancers worldwide. Most cervical carcinoma cells constitutively
express HPV type 16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which provide an ideal and specific target for immunotherapies.
We selected an immunogenic epitope derived from E7 protein (E7 p11-19) presented by HLA-A*02:01 as the
target for the TCRm mAb. This epitope has been reproducibly detected in a majority of cervical cancer biopsies
and cell lines in the context of HLA-A*02:01 molecule by mass spectrometry.
2. Developing TCRm mAb to pIRS2 in the context of HLA-A*02:01. Dysregulated protein phosphorylation
is a hallmark of malignant transformation. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues is retained on
peptides during MHC class I and class II antigen processing and presentation on the cell surface. Therefore,
phosphopeptides derived from inappropriate phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells represent
an extraordinary class of tumor specific neoantigens, that are also widely expressed and not patient-specific.
We hypothesize that phosphopeptides could be used as shared tumor specific neoantigens. We selected a
phosphopeptide of insulin receptor substrate2 (pIRS21097-1105) in the context of HLA-A*02:01 as the target
for the TCRm development. This epitope has been identified in various cancer cells by mass spectrometry.
We have a set of experimental tools and methods to select, characterize specific mAbs and to test their
therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo."

Bordetella species are significant agents of morbidity and mortality worldwide, manifesting the life-threatening
disease pertussis in humans and severe respiratory infections in animals. Despite the availability of pertussis
vaccines, in the past 15 years, the World Health Organization has estimated the global impact of pertussis to be
16 to 24 million cases per year, with 160,000 to 195,000 deaths per year in children. Recent reductions in COVID-
19-related restrictions have correlated with increased pertussis incidence. Indeed, in the US, weekly reported
cases of pertussis in 2023 are double those reported in 2022. The first International Bordetella Symposium, held
in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1962, was an opportune moment for world leaders to discuss outcomes of the
introduction of a whole cell pertussis vaccine and the emergence of an “extracted” acellular vaccine. The 14th
International Bordetella Symposium will be held at the Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of
Sciences, Czech Republic, on June 24-28, 2024. This conference is well-timed to foster dynamic scientific
exchange between scientists, physicians, public health officials and industry representatives and advance the
field by addressing current challenges imposed by suboptimal vaccination approaches, increasing pertussis
incidence and the continued economic burden of Bordetella spp. on agriculture. The location offers an affordable
conference center close to accommodation in a city that is readily accessible to international travelers. Meeting
halls have high-quality technical equipment, supporting the attendance of virtual conferees and onsite skilled
technical assistance. In addition, onsite exhibition, catering, and meeting spaces along with guided tours and
conference dinners will facilitate discussions in a casual atmosphere beyond the program schedule. The
objective of the 14th International Bordetella Symposium is to i) provide high-quality scientific programming and
an opportunity for the global exchange of knowledge and skills; ii) facilitate the career development of early
career researchers in a safe environment; and iii) ensure diverse representation at all levels, from conference
organizers to attendees, and showcase diversity, equity, and inclusivity in the Bordetella field. The conference
will include keynote speakers intermingled with short talks, panel discussions and poster presentations.
Members of the Scientific Organizing Committee and Diversity Ambassadors will select short talk presenters
based on the quality and originality of their research and speaker background as a nationally (US)
underrepresented group or group underrepresented in the Bordetella community. Advertisements on society
websites, social media and mailings will emphasize the availability of travel awards for attendees from
underrepresented groups and first-generation students. Upon registration, those requiring childcare will receive
information on services and access to financial support from the International Bordetella Society. We anticipate
approximately 200 in-person attendees and 100 virtual attendees, with >50% US representation. There is no
equivalent conference providing an international platform for Bordetella discussion."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Cancer Immunotherapy: Beyond Immune
Checkpoint Blockade and Overcoming Resistance, organized by Drs. James Allison, Andrea Schietinger, Antoni
Ribas and Padmanee Sharma. The conference will be held in British Columbia, Canada from March 17–20,
2024.
Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICT) has provided lasting cures for a subset of patients with specific
cancers. Attempts to expand ICT toward other patients and cancers has revealed some of the limitations of ICT,
particularly as monotherapies. This meeting will discuss some of those limitations, touching upon lessons learned
from failed clinical trials, mechanisms of resistance to ICT, and new technologies which offer the promise of a
more comprehensive understanding of the tumor-immune response. A strong emphasis will also be placed on
exploring tumor-immunity beyond T cell biology. A better understanding of why immuno-oncology clinical trials
have failed in the past is expected to better inform basic scientists on design of pre-clinical studies that may
guide improved clinical trials that avoid the mistakes of the past. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through
which cancers are either refractory to initial treatment with ICT or gain resistance over time should provide
avenues to predict rationally designed combinatorial treatments from among the hundreds of thousands to
millions of potential combinations. Finally, new technologies, including high dimensional spatiotemporal imaging
and T cell engineering, provide new opportunities to expand our knowledge of immunology and therapeutic
repertoire sometimes in unexpected ways. This meeting brings together scientists and clinicians from many
aspects of tumor immunology to rethink the next steps in the evolution of cancer immunotherapy. It is expected
to provide a springboard toward basic science discoveries and new, more effective therapies."

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes RNAs and proteins critical for cell function. However, the
pathways that regulate mtDNA synthesis and segregation in animal cells are not well
understood. The goals of this work are to identify the protein components of mitochondrial DNA
nucleoid complexes, to investigate how mitochondrial replication and dynamics are coordinated
to homeostatically maintain mtDNA nucleoid segregation and abundance, and to probe the
mechanisms underlying selection against mutant mtDNAs in somatic cells. These experiments
will provide fundamental insights into the maintenance of the essential mitochondrial
chromosome in animal cells and how maintenance processes are regulated, potentially leading
to the discovery and characterization of novel pathways that regulate the inheritance of mtDNA
disease alleles. We will employ cutting-edge microscopy of living cells and whole animals,
proteomics, and single cell transcriptional analyses to interrogate the molecular functions of
candidate proteins implicated in the maintenance of mtDNA integrity. These experiments will
reconcile inconsistencies in the mitochondrial biology literature, provide fundamental insight into

Data is the primary currency for all domains of today's biomedical research. However, data does not have
some of the properties of a good currency: durability, portability, uniformity, convertibility, and acceptability. It is
vast, heterogeneous, geographically distributed, and often protected by access control mechanisms. It requires
hardware and software complex machinery to process. Skills needed for data interpretation are sparse across
the entire biomedical domain. How does one make such a currency universally beneficial to all infectious
disease researchers who study different organisms with disparate goals, motivations, and expertise? This
brings us directly to the main point of this proposal: to implement a common data analysis
medium—BRC.analytics—that would connect infectious disease researchers to data, tools, and workflows.
The transformative tenets of the proposed system are: (1) giving access to an ensemble of data resources via
a single workspace where data can be stored, combined, and analyzed; (2) enabling access to the majority of
high quality open source tools and allow creation of complex workflows in the workspace; (3) ensuring that
workspace in powered by powerful hardware capable of sustaining thousands of users analyzing large
datasets; (4) providing several modes of access including a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as an
Application Programming Interface (API). BRC.analytics is a unique knowledgebase that provides data, tools,
and infrastructure as well as the know-how” on how to apply this power effectively."
10914444,"Project Abstract - Fishing Partnership Support Services - Safety Training in the Mid-Atlantic
 Fishing Partnership Support Services (FPSS) will continue to use a community-based model to implement
safety training programs that are practical; meet multiple health and safety needs; and reduce the risk of
injuries and fatalities within the commercial fishing industry. From 2005-2014, the three most dangerous
fisheries in the U.S. were on the East Coast. Despite the dangers of their profession, most fishermen on the
East Coast have not received the safety training needed to reduce their risk of injury, illness, and death due to
lack of training opportunities; lack of access for isolated fishing communities; lack of safety training instructors;
financial constraints; lack of awareness of danger; and cultural reluctance to change. FPSS's program will
exert a sustained, powerful influence on the field of occupational safety training by increasing both the supply
and demand for safety training in the Mid-Atlantic; increasing capacity to deliver training throughout the
commercial fishing industry; and bringing innovation and evaluation to every level of the training.
 FPSS will utilize NIOSH grant funds to fulfill the following objectives: Objective #1: Enhance the quality
and availability of safety training that addresses the needs of fishermen, by offering Safety & Survival Training
and Drill Conductor Certification Training. Newly developed training components will include Man Overboard
Recovery Devices. FPSS will offer 18 training sessions over three years in Mid-Atlantic states. Objective #2:
Create a demand for training from within the community by promoting a culture of safety. This will result in
more fishing communities recognizing safety as a top priority. FPSS will partner with apprentice programs that
develop to provide safety training to young fishermen. Objective #3: Increase training capacity by offering
AMSEA's Marine Safety Instructor Training (MSIT) locally and certifying up to 18 new safety training
instructors.
 To evaluate the quality, effectiveness, and impact of the proposed safety training, FPSS will engage
internal and external evaluators in a multi-method approach that includes quantitative and qualitative data
collection, and the use of secondary data sources. Outcomes include: 1: Participants engage in safer
behaviors/practices in their work; 2. Participants maintain a positive attitude toward safety; 3. A culture of
health and safety is created; 4. The numbers of accidents, injuries and fatalities are reduced; and 5. USCG's
search and rescues costs decline. For Research to Practice (r2p) FPSS' evaluation team will engage multiple
stakeholders to identify research needs and questions; design evaluation tools and conduct studies; and
translate and share knowledge, interventions, and evaluation learnings with five key audiences: fishing leaders;
other safety training programs, including NIOSH funded programs; law enforcement, including the U.S. Coast
Guard; state and federal policy makers; and fishing safety researchers."
10917129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our application is in response to RFA-AA-20-007 [Medications Development for the Treatment of Alcohol Use
Disorder (AUD)]. Initial evidence supporting a neuroimmune hypothesis for excessive alcohol consumption led
us to test tetracyclines in reward- and dependence-models. Having shown reductions in drinking and acute
withdrawal, we used structure-functional data to design new chemically modified minocycline (CMM) compounds
for loss of antibiotic properties, but retention of known innate immune action. In collaboration with the NIAAA
Division of Medications Development, we have created and tested 16 CMM analogs for potential treatment of
AUD. Several have shown both a loss of antimicrobial action and improvement over minocycline to reduce
drinking in animal models of high alcohol consumption. Following oral administration tests, we have now
identified a lead (best choice) and a backup compound and are in the process of completing preclinical
pharmacology and toxicology screens. Nearly 15 million people in the US and ~100 million worldwide suffer
from AUD. Over 5% of all medical morbidities share an ethanol-related risk. Although there are three FDA
approved drugs to treat AUD, and several others are used off-label, medications have shown only modest
success (in ~20% of patients treated). As a consequence, there is an urgent need for new pharmacotherapeutics
across the DSM-V AUD spectrum. In fact, improved drugs that reduce high alcohol consumption in either reward-
or relief-seeking patients would be most desirable. Currently, gabapentin is used off label as such; it reduces
alcohol consumption and dependence-related symptoms, but its modest effectiveness and significant side-
effects leave opportunity for considerable improvement. As required by the FDA, preliminary data for our CMMs
show a significant reduction of alcohol consumption in two mammalian species. We have patents covering over
100 tetracycline modifications for use in neuroinflammatory diseases, including AUD. Texas Tech University
System holds the patent rights. They have been licensed to South Plains Biotechnology, Inc., AUD subdivision,
LLC, which is owned, in part, by researchers associated with this project. As a consequence, the success of the
below aims represent a positive step toward potential commercialization. We will complete four aims
addressing: Aim 1: Development of manufacturing standards; Aim 2: Completion of pre-clinical IND enabling
studies; Aim 3: Phase I clinical trial; single-ascending dose; Aim 4: Phase I clinical trial; multiple-ascending
dose. Future Phase II plans include testing in reward- and relief-seeking AUD patients, first in a small trial with
our Clinical Research Institute and then in cooperation with the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group. Impact:
The development of a drug without addiction potential that successfully treats reward- and relief-driven
AUD is critically needed. Our NIAAA collaboration, TTUHSC team, scientific advisers (Drs. Adron Harris and
Bob Messing) and FastTrack (FDA consulting firm) represent unique expertise to complete the proposed work."
10917132,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The detection of temperature change by nerve receptors in human tissues is a life‐preserving
function which is highly evolutionarily selected. Platelets show a unique response to cold with
cytoskeletal rearrangement and low‐level receptor activation. Temperature‐gated transient
receptor potential channels (Thermo TRPs) are a family of ion channels activated by temperature.
Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM8) also known as Cold and Menthol Receptor 1
(CMR1), is a nonselective cation channel gated by cold‐stimuli and various cooling reagents
including menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin. In preliminary studies, we show that platelets express
TRPM8, and the addition of TRPM8 agonists mimic typical morphologic and functional changes
of platelets exposed to cold.
The overarching goal of these studies is to characterize the molecular pathways through which
platelets react to temperature changes. Further elucidating these mechanisms could lead to
improved platelet storage conditions at 4ºC for transfusions, safer antiplatelet therapy, better
prevention of heart attacks, and fewer side effects when therapeutic lowering of the body
temperature after cardiac arrest is required.
In aim 1 of this proposal, we will characterize the role of TRPM8 in platelets and elucidate its
specific function for the cold platelet phenotype. This aim proposes to expand on our preliminary
data that identified TRPM8 on human platelets and underscore its functional relevance. In aim 2
we will evaluate TRPM8 as a target for inhibition during platelet storage at 4ºC utilizing a small
molecule TRPM8 inhibitor. In aim 3 of this proposal, we will determine the role of TRPM8
inhibition during 4ºC storage for recovery, survival, and function after transfusion in healthy
human subjects."
10917134,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The androgen receptor (AR) is the master transcription factor responsible for development and maintenance of
the male sex phenotype. Aberrant AR activity is associated with multiple disorders, including but not limited to
metastatic prostate cancer, androgenetic alopecia, and Kennedy's disease. Cell-based studies have reported
AR is regulated through numerous processes, including 1) androgen stimulation; 2) anti-androgen inhibition; 3)
intramolecular contacts among its domains; 4) association with various protein coactivators and corepressors.
Despite its importance in disease etiology, the mechanistic details underlying AR regulation are largely
unknown due to historical difficulty isolating pure, active multidomain AR variants.
This research will employ biochemical and complementary structural methods – including electron and atomic
force microscopy, and x-ray crystallography – to illuminate the molecular determinants of AR activation through
identification of surfaces important for intramolecular and cofactor-mediated stimulation (Aim 1), and for AR
inhibition by anti-androgen binding and self-regulatory modes of autoinhibition (Aim 3). The molecular details
revealed by the biochemical and structural studies will be validated in biologically relevant AR-dependent cell
lines to determine the functional outcomes of these interactions on cell morphology, growth, AR signaling and
the AR cistrome (Aim 2). The findings from these studies will provide novel insight for modes of dimerization,
intramolecular regulation, and DNA binding for AR as well as other type I nuclear hormone receptors, including
the progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors, and can facilitate potential design of novel
AR-targeting drugs. This research is in line with the goals of the NIGMS of generating fundamental knowledge
that will bear implication for human disease and health.
The comprehensive training plan described will enable the investigator to achieve her career goals of running
an independent academic laboratory dedicated to studying fundamental modes of AR transcriptional regulation
in the context of its active, hyperactivated, and inhibited states, and will provide biochemical, structural, and
functional insight to the consequences of its aberrant activity in disease. As a joint mentee in top prostate
cancer and structural biology laboratories at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Rockefeller
University, she will receive diverse training in prostate biology and electron microscopy that will expand the
investigator's biological understanding and technical repertoire that will enable significant innovation in her
future research. The leadership, networking, and communication skills she will acquire through the MOSAIC

10917135,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Our long-term goal is to contribute to the prevention and treatment of
cataracts, which are the major global cause of visual impairment. Age-related lens optical aberrations manifest
around age forty and gradually progress into a cataract. Accrual of Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to UV
radiation, normal cellular metabolism, etc., is a major cause of age-related cataract (ARC) formation. The
scavenging activity of Glutathione (GSH) and Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (GPX1) helps to detoxify cellular H2O2.
As the lens ages, GPX1 activity is reduced, causing gradual H2O2 accumulation which affects homeostasis and
transparency. Homeostasis of the avascular lens significantly depends on microcirculation to carry in nutrients
and eliminate metabolic waste. Aquaporin (AQP) water channels and Connexin (Cx) gap junction channels are
integral to the lens microcirculation. Lens epithelial cells express AQP1, AQP5, Cx43 and Cx50, and fiber cells
express AQP0, AQP5, Cx46 and Cx50. AQP0, the most abundant lens membrane protein, exists as intact and
end-cleaved forms. Mutation or knockout (KO) of AQP0, Cx46 and Cx50 causes cataracts. Under stressful
conditions, AQP1 or AQP5 KO lenses develop cataracts. Lens Cxs play a role in transporting GSH to the nucleus.
Our preliminary intact lens studies show that lenticular AQPs are permeable to H2O2. In this grant proposal, we,
for the first time, seek to explore the non-canonical role of lens AQPs as peroxiporins or H2O2 transporters,
alongside the protective roles of Cxs and GPX1 in scavenging lenticular H2O2. Main Hypothesis is: Lens AQPs
transport extracellular H2O2 into epithelial and peripheral fiber cells, where it is detoxified by GSH/GPX1,
thus removing extracellular H2O2 from the circulation to central fiber cells, which have low GSH and no
GPX1. Age-induced reductions in the function of GPX1 cause H2O2-initiated damage to lens AQPs, Cxs
and Na+/K+-ATPase, thus compromising the microcirculation and contributing to ARC. To test, in Aim 1,
we will quantify age-related changes in transparency in relation to alteration in H2O2 transport by AQPs using the
lenses of WT and AQP-KO models. We will test if post-translationally end-cleaved AQP0s transport H2O2 and
are regulated by pH, calcium and zinc, using intact lenses of WT and a transgenic mouse model. We will
investigate whether the increase in H2O2 level during aging will alter the intracellular pH of the lens. In Aim 2, we
will explore the protective role of GPX1 on AQPs, Cxs and Na+/K+-ATPase to maintain the lens microcirculatory
system during aging, using WT and GPX1-KO lenses. We will test the spatial and temporal H2O2, and reduced
(GSH) and oxidized GSH (GSSG) levels in GPX1-KO in relation to ARC. In Aim 3, we intend to enhance GPX1
activity through a diet containing GPX1-mimic Ebselen in WT and GPX1-KO mice, to lessen GPX1-reduction-
induced H2O2 surge and adverse oxidative stress during aging. We believe that the emerging data as a function
of aging using suitable mouse models will help to understand the mechanistic and mechanisms of oxidative
stress-induced ARC and will guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat/delay/prevent ARC."

Abnormal metabolism is a hallmark of cancer that helps cancer cells to grow, undergo malignant transformation,
and survive under stressful conditions such as nutrient deprivation. Cancer cells are exposed to many cellular
stresses during tumorigenesis, which must be overcome for the propagation of malignancy. In cancer, the
abnormal activation of many signaling networks serves to disconnect the control of growth, metabolism, and
survival, and recent efforts have sought to therapeutically target cancer metabolism. The phosphatidylinositol 3-
kinase (PI3K)-AKT (protein kinase B) signaling pathway is the most activated in human cancer and has a wide
range of effects on cellular metabolism. We have recently identified the Cdc42/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange
factor (GEF) dedicator of cytokinesis 7 (Dock7) as a novel signaling node that supports sustained basal AKT
activation and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity as determined by its downstream target S6
kinase (S6K) during stressful conditions to maintain signaling activity required for cell survival and transformation.
We find that Dock7 is required for multiple cancer cell lines to resist anoikis and exhibit anchorage-independent
growth. While we observe relatively low levels of AKT phosphorylation compared to stimulation by growth factors,
Dock7-dependent signaling is critical for the survival of cancer cells during nutrient deprivation. I hypothesize
that under cellular stress Dock7 serves as a scaffold for AKT, sustaining its phosphorylation and organizing
signaling partners for mTOR signaling required for stress survival. This project will investigate the role of this
novel Dock7/AKT/mTOR signaling activity in providing a survival benefit to cancer cells under cellular stress. I
propose to study the impact of Dock7-dependent signaling activity on AKT/mTOR signaling, cell survival under
stress, and critical characteristics of malignant progression and aggression. In Aim 1, I will investigate the
functional activities of the Dock-homology region 2 (DHR2) domain of Dock7, which is responsible for GEF
activity, in basal AKT phosphorylation for cancer cell stress survival and malignant transformation. In Aim 2, I
will next identify the novel role of the DHR1 domain in Dock7-dependent AKT phosphorylation, cancer cell stress
survival, and malignant transformation. Then, in Aim 3, I will identify the subcellular location of this Dock7
signaling complex under stress conditions and determine the individual roles of DHR1, DHR2, and activated
Cdc42 in Dock7 localization. The work in this proposal will provide biochemical characterization of Dock7
signaling activity that will lead to a mechanistic understanding of Dock7-dependent AKT/mTOR activation in
cancer cell stress survival. These findings will not only contribute to the understanding of cancer aggression and
metabolism but may also identify new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment."

 While hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a life-saving therapy for previously fatal malignant and
nonmalignant conditions, pulmonary complications such as respiratory failure (RF) remain a barrier. Currently
there is no objective way to determine risk of developing RF, thereby limiting opportunities for early intervention
and prevention. We have identified 3 biomarkers, including stimulation 2 (ST2, the IL-33 receptor), interleukin 6
(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), which hold extreme promise for prognosis of future
occurrence of RF when measured as early as day 7 post HCT, well before typical onset of clinical respiratory
symptoms. Furthermore, we have conducted the two phases of proteomic discovery using mass spectrometry
and have identified 11 additional candidate biomarkers, in addition to ST2, to validate in an independent cohort.
Therefore, we hypothesize that prognostic biomarkers can serve as an early warning for the HCT recipient at
increased risk for RF. In Aim 1, we propose to investigate the effect of dynamic changes of validated biomarkers
at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post-HCT on prognosis for RF. We will then, in Aim 2, validate additional diagnostic and
prognostic candidate biomarkers for RF discovered through our proteomics pipeline. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
conduct a prospective real-time multicenter study to determine RF prognostic biomarkers thresholds for enabling
a biomarker-based preemptive trial In addition to elucidating biologic etiologies of RF that could lead to improved
targeted therapies, this work will lay the foundation for a biomarker-based preemptive clinical trial aimed to
reduce RF and RF-related mortality post-HCT.
 During the award period, I will conduct research at Indiana University School of Medicine under the
primary mentorship of Dr. Sophie Paczesny and the remainder of the co-mentors, advisors and collaborators
outlined in the career development plan. I will focus on gaining critical skills in translational research needed to
successfully compete for NIH-funding and launch an independent research career. Specifically, I will develop a
comprehensive knowledge of clinical biomarker development, proteomic discovery using mass spectrometry,
advanced statistical methods to approach biomarker research including prognostic modeling, and skills in
implementation science to be able to translate these discoveries into clinical practice. With expertise in acute
respiratory failure post-HCT, experience leading multicenter collaborative clinical research studies in this
population, and a strong team of mentors and advisors, I am uniquely positioned to successfully complete the
proposed study and transition to an independent research career."
10915044,"PROJECT SUMMARY
South Africa (SA) has the largest HIV epidemic in the world, with 7.2 million people infected and a prevalence
of 18.8% among adults ages 15-49. Nurses constitute the largest group of providers in SA’s healthcare system
and are frontline treaters in HIV care. They experience particularly high levels of burnout resulting from
resource limitations, chronic work overload, and occupational stress; inadequate staffing, resources, and
wages; increased task-shifting work to nurses; interpersonal conflict; and HIV stigma, including stigma by
association. These stressors are worsened in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provider stress and
burnout leads to negative patient outcomes for persons living with HIV (PLWH), including: (1) self-reported
suboptimal care and attitudes toward patients; (2) decreased patient satisfaction; (3) increased post-
hospitalization recovery time; and (4) reduced adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and
HIV testing uptake as a result of experienced or anticipated negative patient-provider interactions. Patient-
provider relationships are a core element of engagement and retention in HIV care; patients prefer providers
who have good communication skills, and are empathetic, engaging, and validating, behaviors that are difficult
to emulate in the context of high stress and burnout. Interventions that foster resilience can minimize the
negative impact of work-related stress; however, despite decades of research into individual, patient-level
factors impacting HIV care engagement, no known interventions have systematically attempted to support the
wellbeing of nurses in SA by providing them with skills to more effectively manage and cope with stressors that
negatively and directly impact patient outcomes. The objective of this application is to adapt the Relaxation
Response Resiliency Program (3RP) to the needs of nurses providing HIV care in the public sector in SA to
build resilience and reduce stress, and ultimately improve patient-related outcomes. We propose the following
specific aims as part of this formative feasibility and acceptability study: (1) to explore the ways in which the
3RP requires adaptation to meet the needs of nurses providing HIV care in the public sector in SA, based on
data collected from qualitative focus group discussions, and to adapt the intervention accordingly, and (2) after
a small proof-of-concept study, to conduct a randomized pilot of nurses providing HIV care in the public sector
in SA to test the feasibility and acceptability of all study procedures. The proposed work will contribute to our
understanding of how to offset high stress and burnout among HIV care nurses in SA’s public sector, a setting
with the world’s most significant HIV burden, where nurses are the frontline treaters. These data will inform a
larger, multi-site, randomized efficacy trial looking at the impact of the intervention on the wellbeing of nurses,
as well as on patient outcomes (e.g., successful engagement in HIV care, patient-nurse trust, satisfaction with
care, and viral suppression) in public health sector clinics nationwide. Ultimately, we hope to develop an
intervention with applicability to other providers in other resource-limited settings."

More than 276,480 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, with 120,000 cases occurring in
women 65 years or older. Given the increasing median age of the US population, the number of breast cancers
diagnosed in older women is expected to rise by 50% in the coming decades. Older women with breast cancer
experience worse breast cancer-specific outcomes as compared to younger women, under-treatment is likely
to play a central role. Studies have demonstrated that breast cancer patients who receive <85% of received
dose intensity (RDI), a metric that combines the total dose administered with adherence to the planned
treatment schedule, have a 57% increase in the risk of disease recurrence at 10 years as compared to women
who receive at least 85% RDI. Only 50-76% of breast cancer patients >65 receive an RDI >85, largely due to
increased toxicity of therapy in these patients. Reducing treatment-related toxicity to enhance RDI is
critical to improving disease outcomes among the growing population of older breast cancer patients.
To this end, models predicting for severe chemotoxicity demonstrate that a number of potentially modifiable
factors (commonly assessed as part of the geriatric assessment), are important determinants of chemotoxicity,
including function, depression, and falls (or use of assistive devices). Exercise has a significant positive impact
on each of these modifiable factors, in the general population and in cancer patients. However, data on the
ability of exercise interventions to improve treatment tolerance and preserve dose intensity among older breast
cancer patients are lacking. We propose a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a
multicomponent, hybrid telehealth (TH) exercise and protein intake support (the THRIVE Intervention)
on RDI, incidence and severity of chemotoxicities, functional status, muscle mass, and patient
reported outcomes in 270 breast cancer patients age ≥ 65 receiving neo/adjuvant chemotherapy.
Participants will be randomized to the THRIVE Intervention or to a Health Education and Support control
group. The intervention will be delivered through a hybrid model, leveraging the existing Breast Cancer Weight
Loss (BWEL) Trial call center. After 2 in-person, onsite exercise sessions, we will transition to TH sessions
delivered on study provided tablets, by certified exercise coaches who will tailor behavior change to support
adherence relative to symptom burden. To optimize intervention effectiveness, participants will undergo a TH
evaluation of diet adequacy with a registered dietitian, focused on optimal daily protein intake. Protein
supplementation will be provided if needed to achieve 1.2 gm/kg daily intake. The TH focus consolidates
expertise at a well-established call center (BWEL), elevating the potential for broad implementation across the
U.S., including cancer treatment centers with too few patients to justify necessary personnel. The project also
seeks to evaluate intervention cost, as well as the facilitators and barriers to implementation of this TH
intervention, toward the goal of translation to clinical practice upon successful completion of the THRIVE trial."
10915049,"ABSTRACT:
Effector CD8+T cells that promote anti-tumor response become dysfunctional and exhausted. However, the key
mechanisms that define the delicate balance between effector vs. exhausted state of CD8+T cells remain elusive.
Our preliminary studies demonstrate that in early-stage tumors, sumoylation of the T-box transcription factor, T-
bet, facilitates its association with Zbtb42, a member of the ThPOK family of transcription factors. The Zbtb42/T-
bet complex promotes the effector function and anti-tumor activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
Conversely, in advanced tumors, the ubiquitin ligase Trim37 is upregulated in exhausted CD8+TILs, which
targets Zbtb42 for degradation and disrupts the Zbtb42/T-bet complex. Importantly, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
inhibition of Trim37 rescues exhausted CD8+TILs and restores their effector function. These key findings led us
to hypothesize that ubiquitination and sumoylation of the Zbtb42/T-bet complex are critical molecular events that
dictate the effector vs. exhaustion of CD8+TILs, which can be therapeutically targeted.
In Aim1, we will determine the mechanism by which the Zbtb42/T-bet complex promotes effector CD8+T cell
function and anti-tumor response. We will use newly generated Zbtb42-/- and T-bet-K208R-KI mice to investigate
how sumoylation of T-bet at Lys(K)-208 facilitates the formation of the Zbtb42/T-bet complex via the SUMO
interacting motif (SIM) within Zbtb42. Further, we will delineate the mechanism by which the Zbtb42/T-bet
complex co-operatively binds to and transactivates the IFN-γ promoter. In Aim 2, we will investigate how Trim37,
which is upregulated in exhausted (PD1+Tim3+) CD8+TILs in advanced tumors, binds to Zbtb42 via its meprin
and TRAF homology (MATH) domain and targets Zbtb42 for ubiquitination at K164. Using newly generated
Trim37-/- mice, we will examine how disruption of the Zbtb42/T-bet complex leads to the inhibitory transcriptional
profile of exhausted CD8+T cells in advanced tumors. In Aim 3, we will target the Zbtb42-Trim37 pathway in
CAR-T cells to promote tumor regression. We will test the therapeutic potential of blocking Zbtb42 ubiquitination
in CAR-T cells against carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in the MC38 and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
colon cancer model.
Completion of these studies will lead to 1) discovery of the novel Zbtb42/T-bet complex that is critical for effector
CD8+T cell function, 2) determination of how Trim37-mediated ubiquitination disrupts this complex leading to
alternate transcription profile in exhausted CD8+TILs, and 3) evaluate the means to target the Zbtb42/T-bet-
Trim37 pathway to overcome the current limitations of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors."

The purpose of the Biomarkers Core is to provide an organizational model to accelerate the development and
approval of biomarker tests that link biology to clinical outcomes within SPORE projects and across other
Cores. This Core is focused on credentialing both imaging-based and liquid non-invasive assays to assess and
monitor disease status by characterizing the molecular and cellular features of a cancer as it changes over
time. Through the Biomarkers Core, the collection of human biospecimens is scheduled, collected, and tracked
under an IRB-approved clinical protocol. The process of consent, patient registration, and specimen collection
is undertaken in clinic, under the leadership of the Biomarkers Core. Applied to the clinic, the Biomarkers Core
efforts cover patients across the prostate cancer disease continuum. The Biomarkers Core will also conduct
under its leadership the three imaging protocols, for FDHT, PSMA, and DLL3 PET. This core complements the
other SPORE cores and MSK resources that include the Center for Molecular Oncology (CMO), Sloan
Kettering Institute (SKI), the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program (HOPP), Clinical Laboratories, the
Early Drug Development (EDD) Service, and other clinical services. Priorities for the Core are determined by
unmet needs in basic research, drug development, and clinical practice, with the objective of enabling more

Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) has been demonstrated to reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% for
high-risk current and former smokers. However, 25% of the subjects in the NLST demonstrated abnormalities
and a large fraction of those lesions were determined to be false-positives. There is an unmet need to
accurately and non-invasively identify early-stage aggressive lung cancers and distinguish lesions that are life
threatening from those that are not. Recently cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in human blood has emerged as an ideal
source for cancer detection. In this proposal, we develop an integrated system, CancerRadar, consisting of (1)
an experimental assay, cfMethyl-Seq, for cost-effective genome-wide methylation profiling of cfDNA, offering
>10 fold enrichment over Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) in profiling CpG islands; and (2) a
computational framework to extract various information from cfMethyl-Seq data, including cfDNA methylation,
cfDNA fragment size, copy number variation (CNV), and microbial composition, and perform multi-feature
ensemble learning for detecting malignant lung nodule and locating its primary tumor sites. We will validate
CancerRadar with several clinical cohorts. Compared to the commonly used small panels focusing on one type
of markers, CancerRadar profiles and integrates genome-wide profiles of multiple genetic/epigenetic features,
therefore can robustly capture the very small proportion of tumor-derived cfDNA fragments, comprehensively
diagnose patients with heterogeneous cancer pathogenesis, and learn and exploit newly significant features as
training sample size grow."

Fibrotic-like dysfunction and extracellular matrix stiffening of the trabecular meshwork (TM) is a hallmark of
persistent intraocular pressure elevation in primary open-angle glaucoma. Short-term exposure of healthy TM
cells to mechanical insult induces characteristic glaucoma-like pathology, which is recoverable after cessation
of insult. In contrast, glaucomatous TM cells retain a pathologic phenotype via a stored mechanical memory
despite culture within a soft tissue-like matrix environment. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify
how mechanical memory in TM cells is first formed and then stored, and how it contributes to the persistence
of glaucomatous cellular dysfunction. We hypothesize that TM cell mechanical memory plays a central role in
persistent tissue failure in glaucoma. In Aim 1, we will fully characterize TM cell mechanical memory. Cells
“sense” their mechanical environment through mechanotransduction. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of a
key mechanoregulatory transcriptional co-activator Yes-associated protein (YAP) in modulating TM cell
mechanical memory. Cells “store” mechanical memory through chromatin remodeling and epigenetic
modifications. In Aim 3, we will investigate the role of epigenetic modifications in long-term TM cell mechanical
memory retention. We will use our innovative bioengineered primary human TM cell-encapsulated hydrogel
and dynamically tune matrix stiffness to test our hypothesis. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: To determine how mechanical memory persistence contributes to glaucomatous TM cell dysfunction.
Aim 2: To determine how YAP mechanotransduction contributes to TM cell mechanical memory acquisition
and retention.
Aim 3: To determine how epigenetic modifications contribute to long-term TM cell mechanical memory
retention."
10914813,"Project Summary
Immunotherapy has shown profound benefit for adult patients but has yet to be fully unlocked for pediatric solid
tumors such as osteosarcoma (OSA) where a significant percentage of children/adolescents succumb due to
the presence of lung metastasis. OSA, like many poorly tumor immunogenic tumors, is defined by a lack of tumor
specific targets and a regulatory tumor microenvironment (TME). Unleashing immunotherapy against poorly
immunogenic cancers requires new technologies that activate the TME, while concomitantly engaging both
innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to generate sustained cellular immunity.
 We have developed a novel (FDA approved) RNA-nanoparticle (RNA-NP) vaccine that simultaneously
penetrates/reprograms the TME while inducing an OSA specific T cell response. This vaccine utilizes a novel
engineering design that layers tumor derived mRNA into a lipid-nanoparticle (NP) “onion-like” package. We have
shown that systemic administration of RNA-NPs safely mimics viremia, activating the quiescent immune system
in only a few hours for induction of potent anti-tumor efficacy in several poorly immunogenic murine tumors
resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors. These RNA-NPs activate dendritic cells (DCs) that supplant regulatory
intratumoral myeloid populations inducing antigen-recall response with long-term survivor benefits in murine
metastatic pulmonary OSA models. We have established safety of RNA-NPs in acute/chronic murine toxicity
studies, and launched a large animal canine OSA trial which demonstrated that RNA-NP administration is
feasible, safe and immunologically active. While RNA-NPs mediate substantial anti-tumor activity, some animals
suffer tumor outgrowth that warrant exploration of resistance mechanisms in our non-survivors. We have shown
that RNA-NPs can be enriched for tumor specific antigens or configured with siRNAs to target pertinent
regulatory axes (i.e. PD-L1), which can be studied in our murine/canine OSA models. The scientific premise for
this work is that osteosarcoma is encased by a regulatory myeloid microenvironment that actively subverts
adaptive immunity. We hypothesize that myeloid reprogramming of metastatic OSA will lead to safe eradication
of disease. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are:
1. Establish mechanisms of OSA treatment resistance that can be overcome with adaptable RNA-NPs.
2. Identify correlates for vaccine response and escape in a comparative oncology canine OSA model.
3. Conduct a multi-institutional phase I/II study evaluating the safety and activity of the most promising
RNA-NP formulation in recurrent OSA patients.
Successful completion of this study will lead to a novel OSA therapy and a mechanistic understanding of its
therapeutic effects that will be co-opted as biologic response correlates in a human clinical trial.

10914814,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rare diseases are individually rare yet are collectively common and affect millions of patients and their families
in the United States. To date, most efforts for clinical decision support systems (CDSS) for rare diseases are
aimed at deriving diagnoses from genomic data. Although those tools can be critical for genetic specialists, it is
essential for primary care providers to identify suspected patients and make appropriate referrals at an early
stage to get their genomic testing. In this study, we propose a SMART-on-FHIR based Rare Disease Detection
and Escalation Support (RESCUE) CDSS. It will use a centralized informatics approach to identify suspected
rare disease patients from clinical data warehouse (CDW) and send alerts to physicians with escalation support
including phenotype summarization, genetic/genomic test requisition and research opportunity discovery. We
will leverage the cutting-edge natural language processing technics to unlock the clinical features in the clinical
narratives and convert them to the GA4GH-based standard for optimized genetic disease information exchange.
To overcome the challenge of insufficient knowledge and limited sample size for a single rare disease, we
propose a hybrid approach to address this challenge. Expert-curated and knowledgebase-derived phenotype-
based queries will be issued to identify “silver-standard” cases first, and then a neural network-based analytical
model will be trained to further identify potential undiagnosed rare disease patients. We will investigate the
efficiency and accuracy of this analytical model by conducting chart-reviews using the clinical data warehouse
at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). To ensure its generalizability, we will further validate
the model using Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia as the secondary site. The proposed RESCUE CDSS will
apply this analytical model to identify suspected rare disease patients and notify physician by triggering a
provider-facing SMARTapp during the patient encounter. By engaging patients (and their families), primary care
physicians, genetic specialists, researchers, key policy makers and ELSI experts, our stakeholder-centered
participatory approach will ensure that the design of this SMARTapp is interoperable, comprehensible, and
actionable. We will collaborate with Epic IT teams to deploy RESCUE and evaluate its usability in ambulatory
pediatrics clinics at CUIMC. To optimize the performance and to increase interoperability with various EHR
systems, the CUIMC validated software will be further deployed and validated at CHOP. We will further extend
RESCUE to enable an enhanced escalation support including genetic/genomic testing support and patient-
research matching, and retrospectively validate the extended module. Our transferable software and tools
developed in this study will be shared through multiple outlets including CTSAs, the eMERGE network, and the
Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community."

 The goal of the Oklahoma Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (OPCTN) is to provide access for the
underserved rural, urban minority, and American Indian populations of children in Oklahoma to state-of-the-art
clinical trials and the transfer of findings that will benefit the health of those children. The OPCTN will continue
to be a member of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric
Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). The ISPCTN facilitates involvement of sites in IDeA states to design and
implement clinical trials related to the 5 primary ECHO focus areas: 1) upper and lower airway disease, 2)
obesity; 3) pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; 4) neurodevelopment; and 5) positive child health. These are
each areas of substantial health concern for Oklahoma, where our overall child health is rated amongst the
worst in the United States.
 The first phase of OPCTN was successful in developing capacity for pediatric clinical trials through
mentoring of junior clinical investigators, building clinical informatics resources, leadership with the ISPCTN
network, and participation ISPCTN-led trials. The OPCTN was consistently among the top three recruiting sites
within the network and led the development of an ISPCTN feasibility trial focused on rural populations.
 For this renewal phase of the OPCTN, we have assembled a diverse mixture of resources within Oklahoma.
It is centered in the Department of Pediatrics and the Oklahoma Clinical and Translational Science Institute at
the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. It combines the resources of Oklahoma’s IDeA-CTR, the
Oklahoma Shared Clinical and Translational Resources, academic physicians at the state’s allopathic medical
school, clinical trials experts at the Stephenson Cancer Center, providers in Oklahoma urban and rural
communities, and practice-based research networks in order to broaden the opportunities for children in
Oklahoma to participate in clinical research studies. The OPCTN engages with community consultant groups
that represent the American Indian, Latino, and African American communities as well as county-based health
improvement organizations within the state to allow their input on research project design, implementation, and
community participatory interest. The OPCTN also focuses on training pediatric clinicians and research staff to
enhance their experience in the design and conduct of clinical trials in order to increase the capacity of the
medical community in the state to conduct clinical and translational research efforts."

 Heart failure caused by progressive dilated cardiomyopathy is the primary cause of death in
patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal inherited muscle wasting disorder defined by
the FDA as an orphan disease. Cardiomyopathy is detectable in children as young as 10 years old and is
present in most patients by their late teens. Most DMD patients die in their late 20s from heart failure.
 There are no approved medications for DMD cardiomyopathy. Little effort has been devoted to
cardiomyopathy therapeutic development despite it being the main cause of DMD patient mortality. The vast
majority of DMD therapies in development focus on treating skeletal muscle degeneration. Current standard of
cardiac care for DMD patients utilizes steroids and off-label anti-hypertensive and heart failure drugs to reduce
heart inflammatory damage, workload, and tissue remodeling.
 Revidia Therapeutics, Inc. is a cardiac regenerative medicine company developing small molecules that
reactivate endogenous cardiac repair and regenerative processes. We are advancing a novel subcutaneous
formulation of our lead small molecule MSI-1436 into clinical trials as a treatment for DMD cardiomyopathy.
 MSI-1436 has already proven human safety. It functions by inhibiting the tyrosine phosphatase
PTP1B via a novel allosteric mechanism. PTP1B normally inactivates endogenous tissue repair and
regeneration processes. MSI-1436-induced inhibition of PTP1B reactivates these processes, which in turn
reverses tissue damage. Using blinded and randomized experimental and data analysis protocols, we have
shown that MSI-1436 stimulates heart muscle regeneration, improves heart function, and reduces infarct size
in wild type adult mice following myocardial infarction; improves left ventricle ejection fraction in a mouse
pressure overload dilated cardiomyopathy model; slows cardiac degenerative changes in young D2.B10-
Dmdmdx/J DMD mice; and improves left ventricle ejection fraction in aged DMD animals. Doses of MSI-1436
that reverse cardiac injury are up to 50-times lower than the maximum well tolerated human dose.
 Revidia has completed multiple IND-enabling workstreams including 1) FDA pre-IND meetings, 2)
efficacy testing in multiple animal models, 3) in vitro safety pharmacology, 4) ADME studies, 5) dose-range
finding, 6) CMC development and 7) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) manufacturing. The final IND-enabling
workstream that must be completed is FDA-required GLP-compliant safety and toxicity testing of
subcutaneously administered MSI-1436. Proposed studies will validate subcutaneous MSI-1436 dose
formulations and bioanalytical methods and perform repeat dose toxicology and genotoxicity testing and CNS,
respiratory and cardiovascular safety pharmacology testing. Completion of these studies will allow IND
application submission in early 2025 and initiation of clinical trials later that year. Treatment of DMD
cardiomyopathy with MSI-1436 has significant potential to improve patient quality of life and prolong lifespan."

represent one of the most significant racial disparities in reproductive health. Black women have higher
prevalence, higher incidence, more invasive surgical approaches, worse surgical outcomes, more

indicates that race is a social construct, and thus we propose that social and structural determinants of health
such as chronic stressors and life events, discrimination/racism, psychosocial factors, education/knowledge, and
living conditions undergird some of the observed disparities in UF. The overall goal of this center proposal, titled,
Partnering for Equity: An Academic and Community Alliance to Eliminate Disparities throughout the

incidence, growth, treatment pathways, and patient experiences between Black and White women. Our goal is to
provide the much-needed data to identify solutions and interventions to reduce these disparities and improve the
health and well-being of Black women with UF and all women with UF. This Center will be guided by the principles
of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), in which community members, stakeholders, and
researchers work in partnership to conduct research that is equitable in process, resources, accountability, and
responsibility. We will leverage the expertise of our community/academic partners to focus on socio-cultural
drivers of UF incidence, growth, treatment pathways, and patient experiences. To take on this extraordinary

together for months to build the PEACE Center from the ground up. The Center team represents an incredible
range of expertise, from UF clinical, CBPR, and epidemiological experts, to national and global leaders who are
new to UF, but bring vast experience in health disparities, health equity, African American history and culture,
sociology, health services, health behavior, and health intervention. We propose three highly multidisciplinary and
innovative research projects for this center: Project 1- Racial Disparities in UF Care Pathways; Project 2- Multiple
Stress Pathways and Positive Resources in UF Incidence and Growth; and Project 3- Centering Patients:
Development of a Tailored eHealth Intervention to Improve the UF Patient Experience. Two core facilities will
support the research projects: an Administrative Core and the Community Partnership, Education, and Outreach
Core. Internal and External Advisory Boards will provide scientific input biannually and yearly, respectively. The
PEACE Center will include a Pilot Grant Program for Early-Stage Investigators and a Community Dissemination

an Annual PEACE Symposium to celebrate fibroid-related science, patient advocacy, and progress. The
following objectives of the Administrative Core are central to meeting the Center’s goals: 1) provide a focal point
for administration and coordination between sites (University of Michigan, Harvard TH Chan School of Public
Health, Henry Ford Health, Boston University, University of California, Irvine), projects, committees, and boards
to foster efficiency and consistency; 2) ensure completion of all compliance activities, including institutional
review board (IRB) activities, training, reports to the sponsor, and budgetary reports; 3) administer the Pilot Grant
Program; and 4) administer, support, and track dissemination activities including town halls, open houses,
presentations, abstracts, and manuscript submissions. The Administrative Core will be responsible for
coordinating the activities of the multiple institutions involved in this collaborative and ensuring that component
plans are implemented to fulfill the Center’s goals in a timely fashion. It will support the organizational and
governance structure of the PEACE Center and will manage and support the entire range of proposed Center
activities, including ensuring that community partners and organizations are compensated in a timely fashion.
The Administrative Core will be responsible for administering the Pilot Grant Program including ensuring a
national applicant pool and organizing an objective process for selection of awardees in partnership with the
CAB members. The Administrative Core will financially manage the Pilot Grant awards and will facilitate
multidisciplinary collaboration, support, and mentoring of Early-Stage Investigators. The Administrative Core will
ensure the dissemination of PEACE Center work and findings to a broad constituency—from community
organizations to scientists, clinicians, and patients. It will track document development, manuscript submissions,
development of a public website, and organization of community-based dissemination events. To promote the

10907110,"This proposal aims to establish a new category of safe and affordable in vivo HIV cure “drugs” that would
transform the health of substance users who are disproportionately affected by HIV-1 (HIV) disease. Substance
users suffer from high rates of HIV acquisition and transmission, poor adherence to antiretrovirals and drug
resistance, and high prevalence of neurodegenerative and mental health problems. It will also be broadly
transformative to more than 40 million people across the globe who are living with HIV today.
 Using a unique bacteriophage (phage) T4 artificial viral vector (T4-AVV) technology we have recently
developed, we will engineer the 120 x 86 nm T4 capsid nanoparticle to target patient's hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) in vivo and deliver a payload of genome modification molecules. These will introduce a delta-32 deletion
mutation into the CCR5 HIV co-receptor gene, which will make the HSCs and the cells derived from it, HIV-
resistant. This is the only known HIV cure option today, as evident from at least five independent HIV cure cases
worldwide, all remarkably involving transplanted HSCs containing the naturally present delta-32 mutation.
 Our experimental path involves three milestones. First, we will identify targeting ligands that have high affinity
and binding specificity to HSCs from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). These will be selected from libraries of
nanobodies, darpins, and ScFvs displayed on phage T4 capsid through fusion at the tip of the 180Å-long,
flexible, outer fibers known as Hoc. Next, HSC-targeting, lipid-coated, T4-AVVs will be assembled in the test
tube by incorporating all the HIV cure molecules into one nanoparticle by sequential assembly and DNA
packaging. These include combinations of genome editing enzymes, gRNAs, and donor DNAs. The T4-AVVs
that exhibit maximum delta-32 genome conversion will be optimized using an ex vivo UCB-HSC model. Finally,
the HSC-targeted T4-AVVs will be tested in vivo in a humanized DRAGA mouse model reconstituted with the
same UCB-HSCs, using a protocol that mimics HIV cure in humans. Various parameters will be optimized such
that the T4-AVVs will enter HSCs in minutes, deliver payload in hours, and modify genome in 1-2 days.
 The T4-AVV in vivo HIV-cure would be a safe, affordable, outpatient protocol that can be easily administered
to substance users. Since it is targeted, a small dose of T4-AVVs (~10E12 particles) would be sufficient to
capture the HSCs mobilized into patient's blood, while minimizing host immune responses and off-target events.
The delta-32 converted HSCs will then repopulate the body with HIV-resistant blood cells including CD4+ T cells,
which would replace the HIV reservoir and result in functional HIV cure. A single dose of T4-AVVs might be
sufficient, however a second dose may be needed to maximize HSC delta-32 conversion for permanent HIV
cure. Currently, T4-AVV is the only technology that has the capacity and engineering capability to create such
HIV cure delivery vehicles. Furthermore, this plug-and-play drug model can be adapted to many other blood cell
diseases and cancer, potentially transforming future gene therapies and precision medicine."
10907260,"Abstract
Many fundamental questions in neuroscience and neurological disorders, such as those associated with
learning, memory, sleep, aging, and disease progression, would benefit greatly from a technology that enables
brain-wide single-cell readout of signaling activities and gene expression changes over extended time periods
(over weeks, months, to even years). Current single-cell physiology recording methods require external
interfacing to live cells, either optically (via fluorescent probes plus microscopy) or electrically (via electrical
probes). It has been a major challenge to perform long-term optical imaging in vivo beyond several hours, due
to fast photobleaching of fluorescent probes. Electrical probes, on the other hand, often induce unwanted long-
term immune response after implantation and do not support measurement of intracellular signaling and gene
expression activities. In addition, these single-cell recording methods do not support large-scale readout
across the whole brain, while modalities that can image whole brains, such as ultrasound, MRI, and CT, lack
single-cell resolutions. We aim to bridge this technological gap by developing a genetically encoded,
temporally scalable ‘protein ticker tape’ recording system, to enable long-term, brain-wide recording of single-
cell physiology in vivo without any external interfacing to live cells. In our prior work, we found it is possible to
record and store cell physiology histories over time, such as gene expression histories, along elongating
protein self-assemblies in live cells (analogous to tree rings permanently storing wood’s growth conditions), for
subsequent single-cell readout in situ via simple post-mortem tissue processing and imaging techniques. In
this project, we will leverage our expertise in protein engineering and neurotechnology development to
transform this protein ticker tape concept into a technological solution that enables brain-wide single-cell
physiology recording over long (up to a year) and scalable periods of time, where the recording duration is
externally defined by users. We will first engineer novel protein assemblies, via an AI-powered protein design
approach, to boost the information storage capacity and recording precision of protein ticker tapes. Next, we
will employ chemical and light dependent expression systems to externally control the elongation speed of the
protein self-assembly, to enable various recording durations (from a day to a year) externally defined by users.
Finally, we will couple protein ticker tapes to promoters and synthetic expression systems that respond to
signaling events, transcription factor activities, circadian rhythms, and gene expression levels, to enable
recording of these cell physiological events separately and in parallel. We will genetically deliver these protein
ticker tapes in single cells across living mouse brains to characterize and validate their performance, fidelity,
and safety to cells and tissue, followed by demonstrations of long-term, brain-wide, single-cell physiology
recording in healthy and diseased mouse models. We envision this novel recording technology with both
spatial and temporal scalabilities to have a broad impact in biology and medicine."

The value of legally trained researchers is well established, yet there is a dearth of training and mentorship
opportunities to help develop sustainable and effective research careers. First, the curriculum at major U.S. law
schools generally does not include technical training on empirical research. Additionally, unlike other doctoral
training programs, most JD graduates are unlikely to publish during their program. Thus, JDs may not appreciate
how to translate their skills into a successful research career. Second, legally trained scholars with faculty
appointments outside of law schools are usually the only faculty member with a “JD” in their department. This
both creates different demands on their time and hinders potential mentorship on how to advance research that
harnesses a unique skill set. Additionally, legally trained researchers are more likely to feel isolated in their career
path, a sentiment emphasized throughout preliminary gatherings and workshops used to inform the development
of this proposal. The objective of this proposed Conference Grant is to support a one-day workshop aimed at
providing legal researchers with knowledge and skills that will help them develop and implement impactful
research that advances health sciences. The proposed Workshop builds upon several years of developing a
supportive community of similarly situated researchers. In June 2023, we successfully hosted the first half-day
workshop providing content relevant to career development for JDs with faculty appointments or career paths in
health sciences (e.g., schools of medicine, public health). We now seek to sustainably advance this Workshop
with a focus on developing a network of legally trained researchers who are poised to lead and contribute to
rigorous studies that harness the impact of law on health and public health. The proposed Workshop will provide
needed training that is beneficial to new and established researchers and assures that legally trained researchers
are equipped to build a sustainable career that advances health sciences."
10908987,"Advancements in computational psychiatry allow us to isolate multiple, specific cognitive mechanisms that
determine human behavior. This formal modeling framework generates quantitative parameter estimates that
can serve as bridges between pathophysiology and psychopathology. A major goal of computational psychiatry
is to translate these laboratory tools so that they can be used in the clinic. Two critical hurdles need to be
overcome. First, the enhanced validity and sensitivity of computational metrics needs to be established relative
to standard behavioral performance metrics in key psychiatric and nonpsychiatric populations. We propose to
do that by addressing a range of cognitive and motivational domains that have been strongly implicated in
psychopathology, including working and episodic memory, visual perception, reinforcement learning, and effort
based decision making. Second, we need to establish and optimize the psychometrics of these computational
metrics so that they can be used as tools in treatment development, treatment evaluation, longitudinal, and
genetic studies. These powerful metrics must have adequate test-retest reliability, and not be limited by ceiling
and floor effects. We propose to develop these methods using an open, flexible, and scalable framework and
demonstrate that they provide valid data both in the laboratory and in large-scale Internet-based data collection,
facilitating “big data” studies of cognitive processes. To this end, the current project will leverage the expertise
of Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability and Clinical applications in Serious mental illness (CNTRACS)
consortium, a multi-site research group with an established record of rapid cognitive tool development and
dissemination. Aim 1 is to establish that model based parameters for the measurement of cognitive function are
more sensitive than standard behavioral methods in assessing deficits across a range of common mental
disorders, and have an enhanced capacity to predict clinical symptoms and real-world functioning, with a sample
of 180 patients with psychotic and affective disorders (both medicated and unmedicated) and 100 healthy
controls. Aim 2 is to measure and optimize the psychometric properties (test re-test reliability, internal validity,
floor and absence of ceiling and practice effects) of computational parameters described in Aim 1, in a new
sample of 180 psychiatric patients and 100 healthy controls. Aim 3 is to establish the feasibility and replicability
of model-based analytic approaches outside the laboratory for assessing RDoC dimensions of interest, and to
assess their relationships to variation in psychotic-like experience, depression and anhedonia, as well as real-
world functioning in a community sample of 10,000 recruited over the Internet. Aim 4 is to validate key model
based parameters against well-characterized neurophysiological measures acquired using EEG recordings
during task performance. Successful completion of these Aims will significantly advance the field by providing
easily administered and scalable web-based tools for estimating the integrity of key neural systems that underlie
normal cognition and motivation and form the basis of common forms of cognitive and affective psychopathology."
10909146,"Project Summary
Today, we live in an age of unprecedented access to food. Recent research suggests that many Americans eat
from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep. Night eating, specifically, is linked to several aging-
related comorbidities, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. While much ongoing
research investigates the mechanisms by which dietary components affect metabolism, it is less understood how
the timing of feeding affects metabolism. To this end, dietary interventions that alter the timing of feeding have
been shown to protect many aspects of health, even without reducing caloric intake. Time-restricted feeding
(TRF) diets have been shown in mice and humans to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, decrease insulin
resistance, lower blood sugar. In mice, TRF has been shown to reduce fat levels, protect against a high-fat diet,
and prevent obesity. Using Drosophila melanogaster, the Shirasu-Hiza lab developed a robust TRF diet that
extends lifespan and delays molecular signs of aging, such as protein aggregation, and showed that TRF
enhances circadian gene expression and requires the circadian clock to confer lifespan benefits. In addition, we
found that TRF seems to reprogram lipid metabolism; after TRF treatment, flies responded to fasting by utilizing
lipids much faster than controls, leading to increased rate of triacylglyceride loss and starvation sensitivity. I
found that this TRF-accelerated lipid usage, like TRF-induced lifespan extension, requires circadian components
but, unlike TRF-induced lifespan extension, does not require autophagy components. Because the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear, I propose to identify molecular components that drive the effects of TRF on lipid
metabolism. I will use Drosophila melanogaster, an advantageous model organism for this work because: many
mammalian metabolic pathways are conserved in flies; flies have short generation time (2-3 months); and flies
offer a plethora of powerful genetic tools. Aim 1 will identify specific tissue(s) in which circadian regulators are
required for TRF-accelerated lipid usage. Aim 2 will examine the molecular mechanisms by which TRF changes
lipid metabolism. I will use RNA-sequencing analysis to identify transcriptional differences between TRF-treated
flies and their controls; significantly differentially expressed genes and/or pathways will be assessed for their
functional role in TRF-accelerated lipid usage. Aim 3 will investigate the therapeutic potential of TRF in diet-
induced obesity. Flies fed a high-sugar diet and have hallmarks of obesity will be treated with TRF to test if
obesity-related phenotypes are ameliorated upon TRF treatment; we will test both young and old flies. These
experiments will determine the molecular mechanisms connecting TRF to lipid metabolism and how TRF can be
used to ameliorate obesity- and aging-related pathologies. This will improve our understanding on how TRF can
confer health span benefits while also testing its therapeutic potential in aging-related, diet-induced obesity."

The primary goal of the proposed work is to provide the PI with advanced biomedical research training,
outstanding mentorship, and protected time to become a leading independent researcher in post-anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) rehabilitation. A significant consequence of the approximately 250,000
anterior cruciate ligament injuries that occur annually in the United States is that unresolved neuromuscular
impairments often lead to the development of detrimental knee osteoarthritis and other debilitating
comorbidities. Despite extensive rehabilitation, protracted deficits in gait mechanics remain and directly
contribute to detrimental knee loading. Yet, a promising finding from stroke research is that an asymmetric
walking protocol can disrupt maladaptive gait mechanics and lead to the adoption of new, healthy gait patterns.
While the success of the asymmetric protocol in correcting adverse gait patterns is often assessed by the
magnitude of the between-limb gait speed perturbation, this novel intervention to our knowledge has never
been employed in post-ACLR patients. Thus, I will employ experimental gait analysis, computational modeling,
biosignal processing, and machine learning to restore healthy post-ACLR gait mechanics and reduce knee
loading as outlined by the following aims:
 Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of asymmetric walking protocol gait perturbation magnitudes in
 restoring healthy gait in post-ACLR individuals.
 Aim 2. Develop patient-specific models to evaluate the impact asymmetric walking protocol gait
 perturbation magnitude has on reducing detrimental knee loading in post-ACLR individuals.
 Aim 3. Generate personalized data-driven clinical algorithm to rapidly and non-invasively predict knee
 loads in a clinical setting.
The results of this research will yield new therapeutic interventions and treatment guidance to improve post-
ACLR rehabilitation outcomes.
The successful execution of the proposed work will involve a strong team of interdisciplinary researchers with
skills in signal processing, machine learning, medicine, biomedical engineering, computational modelling, and
physical therapy. The PI has assembled a dynamic team with a superb reputation for mentoring others and
they will provide her with research guidance in addition to career and professional development direction and
support. This mentorship combined with strong institutional support, state-of-the-art resources, and facilities,
and dedicated protected time will allow her to successfully perform the research and training activities outlined
in her K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award."

The lung cancer early detection CVC has two main goals: Specific Aim 1 is to develop a blood-
based biomarker panel for personalized risk assessment, modeled for its cost effectiveness. To
this effect, substantial validation work in phase 3 studies has been done using retrospective
longitudinal cohorts to test the performance of a four-marker protein panel (4MP) as a means to
determine lung cancer risk and need for CT screening. The goal moving forward is to test the
4MP alone and in combinations with other types of markers in the screening setting, using lung
cancer screening cohorts available to the CVC. The resulting marker panel, in combination with
subject characteristics, would identify subjects who are currently not eligible based on USPSTF
criteria that would benefit from CT screening based on their risk, ultimately leading to a utility trial
for which a concept has been presented at a recent EDRN scientific meeting. The utility trial
concept also includes as an objective to test the value of biomarkers in informing subjects who
are currently eligible but not decided to undergo CT screening, about their risk through a decision
sharing process. Specific Aim 2 will test the use of biomarkers and AI for interpretation of CT
images and to personalize the screening frequency and duration. Sub Aim 1 is intended to validate
the macrovasculature surrounding a nodule (vessel number) previously developed as a
biomarker, in an independent screening cohort. Sub Aim 2 is intended to develop a validated
integrative computational model for improved early lung cancer detection that includes blood-
based biomarkers, CT features such as emphysema, presence or absence of a nodule, small
airways and subject characteristics for interpretation of CT images and to determine screening
frequency. The model will be subjected to a cost effectiveness analysis compared to current lung
cancer screening guidelines.
The CVC represents a multi-institution, multi-investigator effort with expertise in cancer
biomarkers and statistics; pulmonology and lung cancer; epidemiology; radiomics, bioinformatics
and artificial intelligence; and clinical trial design, simulation modeling and cost-effectiveness
analysis. The CVC brings in substantial accomplishments in biomarker discovery and validation
related to lung cancer screening and in CT image analysis. In pursuit of its aims, the CVC has
access to samples from a multitude of cohorts for validation studies."
10916816,"This proposal focuses on our discovery of new signaling pathways mediated by the p90 ribosomal S6
kinase (RSK2) that regulate vascular smooth muscle (VSM) mediated vascular resistance, myogenic
tone and blood flow with the rational that outcomes have potential to deliver new therapeutic targets.
The myogenic response of small resistance arteries is critical for protection of downstream arterioles
and capillaries against barotrauma due to excessive changes in intravascular pressure. Our
understanding of the signaling pathways that control myogenic and agonist-mediated vasoconstriction,
vascular resistance and blood pressure homeostasis are incomplete and this proposal addresses this
gap in our knowledge base. Our overall objective is to determine the contribution of RSK2 to vascular
physiology and pathophysiology from a mechanistic and functional perspective. Our central hypothesis
is that RSK2 kinase mediates a novel network of pathways that result in regulation of VSM contraction
in response to myogenic pressure and to agonists. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data
identifying three RSK2 targets in resistance arteries which potentiate the contractile state: (1) RLC20,
leading to direct augmentation of the canonical activation of myosin cross-bridge function; (2) NHE-1
Na+ /H+ exchanger, the phosphorylation of which contributes to an increase in pHi associated with an
increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], thereby potentiating the MLCK-mediated pathway; and (3) two RhoA-
specific nucleotide exchange factors, with potential regulatory impact on the RhoA-mediated pathway.
Our preliminary data also suggest that RSK2 signaling contributes ~20% of maximal myogenic force
and that arteries from a Rsk2-/- mouse or treated with RSK inhibitors are more dilated, have reduced
myogenic tone and RLC20 phosphorylation and that Rsk2-/- mice have lower blood pressure compared
to wild-type mice. We hypothesize that this non-canonical RSK2 pathway augments and cross talks
with the canonical Ca2+/MLCK and RhoA/ROCK Ca2+-sensitization pathways to regulate
vasoconstriction and basal BP. The following aims test our hypotheses: Aim 1: To determine how RSK2
contributes to VSM contraction in response to perfusion pressure and agonists, with a focus on select
phosphorylation targets, i.e. RLC20, NHE-1 and RhoGEFs. Aim 2: To assess the contribution of RSK2
to blood pressure homeostasis. Outcomes are expected to establish and add a new RSK2 mediated
signaling network to the canonical MLCK and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways regulating VSM tone
and vasoconstriction and to provide possible new therapeutic targets for contractile pathologies of the
vessel wall."
10916466,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The effects of genetic elements on human health are highly dependent both on other
genes in the genome as well as external environmental influences. Understanding how
functional biological systems arise from the integration of environmental and genetic
information is a central research challenge that has implications for medicine,
agriculture, and the response of our global ecology to a changing environment. In ants,
environmental signals, including social interactions and nutrition, cause developing
larvae to differentiate into distinct morphological castes as adults. These individuals
cooperate to form a coherent social unit, analogous to the epigenetic processes of cell
differentiation and cell signaling that underpin the development of unitary organisms.
Caste development in ants provides an opportunity to understand how environmental
information can induce alternative genetic programs at the level of an entire animal.
Furthermore, the study of castes will allow us to understand how heterogeneous groups
of individuals cooperate to produce functional collective behaviors, and the way that
these groups can evolve. All of these topics are directly relevant to the genetic and
cellular basis of human physiology and could greatly improve our understanding of
human health.
To identify and characterize the core mechanisms of caste development in ants, this
proposal presents an integrative research program that spans multiple scales of
biological organization: 1) The use of functional genetic manipulations and mutant
libraries to study caste from a developmental perspective using highly controlled and
replicated experimental methods. 2) The application of recent advances in population
and comparative genomics to understand the genetic basis of caste evolution in natural
ant populations and validation of results using laboratory experiments. 3) The generation
of a large-scale database of caste morphology across both living and fossil ant species,
and the application of these data to test specific predictions about how the mechanisms
of caste development have constrained and facilitated caste evolution throughout the
ants. This research will provide some of the first mechanistic insights into caste
development and evolution, and will promote a unified understanding of epigenetics,
phenotypic plasticity, and emergent properties in biological systems."
10914568,"SUMMARY
Emerging and re-emerging neurotropic viruses, including flaviviruses and alphaviruses, generally cause fever,
malaise, and related symptoms. However, in some patients, these viruses enter the central nervous system
(CNS) and cause severe illness and disease resulting in meningitis, encephalitis, and death. Several cellular
mechanisms have been described that allow viruses to bypass the blood-brain barrier. However, to date, there
have been no anatomical routes identified that enable direct passage of virions in the periphery into the CNS.
This highly collaborative and interactive proposal between the Diamond and Kipnis laboratories will advance
our mechanistic understanding of how meningeal structures function in the regulation of and response to
neurotropic virus infections. Our overarching hypothesis is that neurotropic viruses can directly enter the
CNS through arachnoid cuff exit (ACE) points, a newly described meningeal structure linking the CNS and
periphery. We hypothesize that neurotropic virus infections early-in-life alter the development of meningeal
immunity, and this increases the severity of and vulnerability to heterologous neurotropic virus infections
later in life. We will address our hypotheses in four specific aims: (1) We will define the role of arachnoid
cuff exit (ACE) points in neurotropic flavivirus entry into the CNS and provide a detailed transcriptional profile
of meningeal and brain responses to neurotropic flavivirus infection at different ages (e.g., in utero, neonatal and
adult); (2) We will determine how early-life neurotropic virus infection and IFN-g signaling modulates the
development of meningeal lymphatic vessels; (3) We will test the contribution of IFN-g signaling in meningeal
stromal cells to ACE point development in the context of early-life neurotropic virus infection; and (4) We will
define the effects of early-in-life neurotropic virus infection (with Zika virus [ZIKV], a TORCH pathogen) on the
neuropathogenesis of a second, heterologous neurotropic virus in adulthood. Conceptually, we will define the
role of newly described meningeal structures in viral entry into the CNS. Mechanistically, we will explore how
virus-induced IFN-g signaling modulates the development of meningeal immunity and its subsequent impact on
neurotropic virus infection. Our suite of relevant neurotropic flavivirus and alphavirus mouse models (e.g., ZIKV,
WNV, VEEV, WEEV), novel inducible Cre-driver mouse lines enabling targeting of specific cell types in the
meninges (e.g., arachnoid barrier cells, Dpp4-CreERT2; dural border cells, Slc47a1-CreERT2) and state-of-the-
art immunological assays of meningeal structure and function will enable us to define how meningeal
immunity is affected by and modulates the neuroinvasion and neuropathogenesis of virus infection. Together,
our team will elucidate the mechanisms and reciprocal relationships between CNS invasion by neurotropic
viruses and meningeal immune responses, which could provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against
neurotropic viruses."
10912627,"Project Summary/ Abstract: Drug adverse events have been estimated to contribute to 16% of healthcare
spending in the US, and less than 10% of new treatments reach the clinic, suggesting we need better models
for anticipating drug effects. Intriguingly, cells have multiplexed, and cascading effects in response to stimuli,
such as drug therapies. For instance, a drug stimulus can induce multiple outcomes including modifying disease
symptoms or causing undesirable side-effects, and further, drugs can influence proteins downstream of their
intended targets. Yet, drug therapies are not routinely designed with their multiplexed, cascading effects or multi-
protein binding properties in mind because we lack quantitative mechanistic models for understanding these
interesting cellular effects. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network models have identified downstream proteins
associated with diseases and side-effects relevant to drug therapies, demonstrating the ability to link multiplexed
outcomes with a stimulus. These associative models are insufficient for prioritizing drug target proteins because
PPI networks lack mechanistic detail to describe the magnitude or relative contribution of cellular responses to
multi-protein stimuli. The overall objective of this research is to derive quantitative relationships between multi-
protein stimuli and downstream response proteins using clinical data. This proposal is innovative because of the
context-specific interaction (CSI) approach: compared to other PPI network approaches, CSI analysis
demonstrated a 50% and 76-95% improvement in prediction accuracy and precision, respectively, when
identifying severe adverse events using PPIs downstream of drug targets and the emphasis on clinical data
integration. This approach emphasized the importance of learning PPI network parameters using phenotype-
specific data to better understand all network-associated phenotypes and demonstrated the feasibility of deriving
mechanistic details in PPI network models. This program is significant because it stands to reduce overall side-
effects and increase therapeutic efficacy by advancing a better understanding of cellular multiplexed responses
to multi-protein stimuli. Further, I have demonstrated consistent productivity and the flexibility and adaptability in
pursuing research projects to establish a distinguished independent career."

 Liver immune cell activation is central to alcohol associated liver disease (ALD) and is poorly understood.
The protein homeostasis network/pathways are crucial in safeguarding the cellular proteome from cellular stress.
Amongst these, proteostasis mediator HSP90 is widely studied and extensively explored as a therapeutic target
in cancer. We reported two isoforms of HSP90, HSP90AA1 (stress inducible cytoplasmic HSP90) and
HSP90B1/GP96 (Endoplasmic reticulum paralog of HSP90) are important in ALD. These studies point to a
pathophysiological role for HSP90 in ALD. Studies during the last funding period of this project established that
liver targeting of HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG using nanoparticles in ALD can prevent and reverse liver injury,
GP96/HSP90B1 deficiency in macrophages facilitates resolution of liver inflammation and ALD, M-TLR4 deficient
mice are not protected from ALD, inhibition of HSP90 reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activity decreasing IL-1β
protein and HSF1 partially contributes to reduced pro-inflammatory signaling, whereas deficiency of HSF1 did
not protect from ALD, suggesting that HSF1 does not contribute to resolution of ALD. In the next project period
we will investigate mechanisms mediated by HSP90AA1 and HSP90B1/GP96 in alcohol induced liver
macrophage activation resulting in ALD. We propose that HSP90 induces inflammation by alternate mechanisms
(independent of HSP90/TLR4 axis), for instance macrophage aerobic glycolysis via epigenetic mechanisms or
HIF1α. In our preliminary data, we found that HSP90AA1 is detected in the nucleus in ALD and its inhibition can
modulate expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Pilot data also reveal that inhibition of HSP90AA1
reduces alcohol mediated induction of glucose transporter (SLC2a1/GLUT1) and hexokinase II, two important
mediators of glycolysis, suggesting a role for HSP90 in metabolic programming of M1 macrophages in ALD. On
the other hand, HSP90B1/GP96 induced preferably in liver macrophages promotes inflammation via glycolysis
and its inhibition induces GRP78+ATF3+Trem2+ restorative/reparative macrophages resolving ALD. We
hypothesize that alcohol induced HSP90AA1 facilitates macrophage aerobic glycolysis via epigenetic
mechanisms whereas HSP90B1/GP96 and ER stress facilitate macrophage glycolysis via HIF1α in ALD.
Inhibition of HSP90 in ALD induces ATF3+Trem2+ reparative macrophages using OXPHOS facilitating
protection. The specific Aims of this proposal are - 1) To identify HSP90AA1 mediated epigenetic and metabolic
programming of macrophages in murine ALD in vivo and human AH PBMCs in vitro. 2) To characterize the
significance of macrophage-specific HSP90B1/GP96 in macrophage metabolism and assess significance of
ATF3 and TREM2 in macrophages conferring protection from liver injury. Collectively, during the next project
period our studies will identify novel metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms regulated by HSP90 and characterize
reparative macrophages crucial in resolution of ALD. Studying these pathways in mouse ALD model and human
AH patient monocytes will provide basis for future clinical development of HSP90 in ALD."
10912741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major unanswered question is how chromatin topology coordinates human development and cellular
differentiation, and how genome folding is differentially regulated in human disease. It is thought that three-
dimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms
of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to
elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its
molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human
congenital heart disease (CHD). CHDs are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart
development. The genetic basis of CHD is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g.
WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset
arrhythmias. The impact of CHD mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D
genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations
in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to
elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal
and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map
of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (CM) and endothelial cell (EC) differentiation. We will use
directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: CMs and
ECs, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D
organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated
cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In
Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin
organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with CHD-associated mutations in transcriptional
regulators, differentiated into CMs and ECs. These findings will establish the degree to which CHD is caused
by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular
diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of CHD and synthetic non-
coding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning
model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By
introducing thousands of CHD patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize
variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding.
Several candidates will be validated in engineered iPS cells differentiated into CMs and ECs. These results will
provide a novel platform for computational discovery of disease variant impact across diverse human diseases"

 This project will develop and implement a training program in neurotherapeutics discovery and
development for faculty members and advanced postdoctoral fellows, centered around a 4-day short course
that will provide the trainees with the various knowledge elements required to discover and advance a
neurotherapeutic agent – either small molecule or biological – to IND. The course is offered in conjunction with
the American Society for Experimental Neurotherapeutics (ASENT). The training, which is designed to be
applicable to diverse diseases of the nervous system, will equip students with a broad understanding of the
various component steps in the neurotherapeutics drug discovery and development process. Students will
learn how to identify a good drug discovery target; how to construct an assay; the elements of medicinal
chemistry; how to conduct animal efficacy testing; the principles of ADME studies, safety testing, and
formulation; special considerations for development of biological products, including monoclonal antibodies,
oligonucleotides and viral vector gene therapies; the steps required to prepare an IND document and the
principles for interacting with the FDA; the principles of intellectual property as they relate to
neurotherapeutics discovery and development; and how to seek funding for academic drug discovery
research. They will also receive training in responsible conduct of research. Students will be equipped with
the skills to develop and coordinate an entire drug discovery and development effort, and to work
collaboratively with experts in each of the component areas. The training will combine didactic lectures with
active engagement activities in which the students will be challenged to utilize the lecture material to work
through their own drug discovery project plan with the guidance of the area experts. The 4-day short course
will be offered annually, a total of five times. After attending the short course, trainees will participate in
ongoing activities that provide continuing professional development through engagement with ASENT."

Disorganization in psychosis has important clinical implications but is under-studied. Several lines of evidence
suggest that disorganization reflects higher genetic loading and worse outcomes, and is sensitive to treatment
response and relapse. We will use computational linguistics to measure disorganization in a sensitive,
objective, efficient, reproducible, and repeatable way. Speech will be elicited with open-ended and structured
tasks from 270 people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and mood disorders with psychotic features,
generating ~30,000 sentences across the sample. Findings will be validated in an existing independent
dataset. We will measure psychosis symptoms, functioning, and cognition in both samples. Incoherence and
inefficiency will be labeled for individual sentences and rated for the overall participant. Our Specific Aims are
as follows: (1) Develop deep-learning methods to classify sentence-level disorganization; (2) Integrate across
computational features to predict participant-level disorganization; (3) Predict key participant characteristics
using linguistic features. An integrated training plan will combine hands-on experience through these research
aims with mentorship, coursework, self-study, seminars, and conferences to achieve the following Training
Goals: (1) Proficiency in computational linguistics and machine learning methods, (2) Expertise in validating
clinically-relevant biomarkers, and (3) Development as a physician-scientist. This work provides the foundation
needed to develop cutting-edge computational methods into biomarkers of disorganization and key psychosis
outcomes. We lay the groundwork for future studies that leverage these features as early markers of treatment
response and relapse, and that use these features to connect behavioral phenotypes with underlying biology.
The proposed project builds on my existing expertise to develop the technical proficiency and expertise in
psychosis biomarker research I need to lead new discoveries in this area as an independent physician-
investigator."
10911870,"Engineering of bacterial synthetic multicellular systems and materials hold promise for many health-
relevant applications such as modular drug biosynthesis, living diagnostic devices, and synthetic bioﬁlm research
models. To date, bacterial synthetic biology has largely focused on the scales of molecules and single cells.
Equivalent work on bacterial synthetic consortia is much less advanced, in signiﬁcant part due to the previous lack
of suitable synthetic and genetically encoded cell-cell adhesion tools to control the assembly, development, and
functionality of multicellular systems. We recently developed the ﬁrst such synthetic cell-cell adhesion toolbox, as
well as tools for optogenetically controlling cell-surface deposition and patterning.
 The speciﬁc objectives of this research are to signiﬁcantly advance these synthetic cell-adhesion tools, and
to develop design principles and predictive modeling tools that enable consortia engineering and patterning that
integrate all relevant length scales (i.e., molecular, cellular, and multicellular), and ultimately pave the way for
medially relevant applications. Our main hypothesis is that we can signiﬁcantly advance our control over the
strength, speciﬁcity, and subcellular localization of synthetic adhesion proteins in Escherichia coli, which will
allow rational tuning of consortium-level biophysical properties such as porosity and viscoelasticity, and which
will ultimately enable versatile multicellular consortium engineering and patterning. This work will constitute
a foundation for various biomedical applications such as biocompatible materials, multicellular plug-and-play
pathway engineering, targeted in-vivo drug delivery, and living diagnostic devices.
 Our interdisciplinary methodology combines synthetic biology, biophysics, instrumentation and modeling. All
experiments will be done in a quantitative manner. The proposed investigations include three independent yet
synergistic Speciﬁc Aims motivated by our hypothesis: (Aim 1) Advance the functionality of the synthetic adhesin
toolkit at the subcellular level; (Aim 2) Achieve engineering control over synthetic consortium properties such as
viscoelasticity and porosity at the scale of 10-100 µm; and (Aim 3) Achieve higher-level consortium patterning
on the scale of centimeters and demonstrate potential for medical applications.
 The PI (Prof. Riedel-Kruse) and his team are well-suited for this project as we have signiﬁcant
expertise in synthetic biology, biophysics, instrumentation (e.g., microﬂuidics, imaging), and modeling genetic
circuits and biophysical systems across scales. We developed the ﬁrst synthetic cell-cell and optogenetic cell-surface
adhesion toolboxes in bacteria. Multiple collaborators provide additional domain expertise in key areas. Overall,
this project's innovation lies in establishing synthetic adhesins as an essential and integral component of the
synthetic circuit-engineering toolbox and in establishing a novel paradigm for modular engineering of multicellular
living materials. Accordingly, this project will broadly impact the engineering of synthetic consortia for basic
research as well as enable a dynamic spectrum of future applications in health."

The Washington University T32 postdoctoral training grant “Translational Imaging in
Radiopharmaceutical Sciences” (abbreviated as “TIRS”) is a multidisciplinary initiative to train the
next generation of PET molecular imaging scientists to design, develop, and translate PET
radiotracers for noninvasive detection of pathophysiology mediating development of
neurodegenerative diseases and ADRDs. This training program will be spearheaded by
Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology (MIR), an institution known worldwide as a frontier for
translational PET research, and a preferred first stop for radiopharmaceutical scientists for
learning applied nuclear imaging research. To accomplish this novel training objective, the T32
TIRS program brings leading scientists from radiological sciences division of the MIR, the Knight
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC), Molecular Imaging Center, Institute of
Clinical and Translational Sciences, Cyclotron-GMP facility and PET-Radiotracer Translational
and Resource Center (P41 program through NIBIB) and faculty members as mentors from 12
departments to accomplish aims of proposed training for investigation of new or existing
biomarkers mediating AD and ADRDs with overlapping pathophysiology, assist in noninvasive
early detection of diseases, facilitating drug development and allow stratification of treatment
paradigms for managing patient care. Of note, the T32 TIRS mentors include chemists,
biochemists, biomedical engineers, immunologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, radiochemists,
and radiologists. The postdoctoral trainees will be drawn through various participating
departments at the medical school, and Danforth campus, including other universities in
metropolitan St. Louis area, and nearby academic institutions in the Midwest. We are proposing
to train 3 postdoctoral trainees each year, wherein each trainee will be enrolled for 2 years of
training, over 5 years of the T32 program. All trainees will be trained through mechanism of dual-
mentorship (one in basic science and other physician-scientist to provide multidisciplinary
training) and all trainees will be trained in responsible conduct of research including instructions
in methods of experimental rigor for accomplishing reproducible science. Of note, scientists
training at the interface of neuroscience and radiopharmaceutical sciences are also rapidly
declining nationwide in general, and there is a clear shortage of radiopharmaceutical scientists
across the board in the US workforce. Therefore, our T32 postdoctoral training program TIRS
would be expectedly to substantially meet this critical shortage of radiopharmaceutical scientists
trained at the interface of neuroscience and radiopharmaceutical sciences. Although our current
T32 TIRS programmatic mission is directed for trainees at ADRDs, we envision that trained
molecular PET imaging research scientists could also serve other departments and fields
including the medical oncology, therefore, extending significance and scope of TIRS training
program well-beyond the field of neuroscience. Overall, we (the T32 TIRS program director and
co-directors) are confident that postdoctoral scientists trained through this program will be
transitioning into faculty positions nationwide and will be expected to serve the field of diagnostic
nuclear medicine in neuroscience for several decades."
10912074,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescents and early Young Adults (AYAs, 12-25 years-old) with cancer are at high risk of poor psychosocial
outcomes because their distinct developmental challenges add to the burden of cancer. This is particularly true
when AYAs transition from active treatment to cancer-surveillance (“early survivorship”) because this time
demands increasing autonomy, re-integration into social, educational/vocational networks, and re-evaluation of
self-identity. We created “Promoting Resilience in Stress Management” (PRISM): a novel, brief, skills-based
program promoting AYA-endorsed “resilience resources” (stress-management, goal-setting, positive-reframing,
and meaning-making). PRISM involves 4, 30-60 minute telehealth sessions between AYAs and certified
PRISM coaches, plus an award-winning smartphone app. In a phase 2 randomized trial of 92 AYAs receiving
cancer-treatment, PRISM improved patient-reported resilience, quality of life, hope, benefit-finding, and
psychological distress early after its delivery, compared to usual care. While these findings were promising,
they were tempered by 3 key threats to PRISM’s scalability: (1) PRISM’s delivery demands scarce human
resources that might be replaced by digital media; (2) PRISM’s durability was limited after the study ended;
and, (3) we lacked tools to recognize real-time changes in AYA distress that warranted additional support.
Thus, we now propose a multi-center, Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) to address
these 3 barriers among AYA survivors of cancer. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of video-
and text-PRISM coaching vs. the self-guided mPRISM app; (2) Determine the optimal method for
maintenance of PRISM-response; and (3) Explore correlations between patient-reported resilience,
distress, hope, quality of life, anxiety, and depression with validated instruments and: (a) in-app
resilience and stress ratings, and (b) digital phenotype (passive smart-phone data including phone/text
logs and accelerometer data). With SMART design, N=325 English or Spanish speaking AYAs from 3 diverse
U.S. regions (Northwest/Alaska/Hawaii, Midwest, and South) who completed cancer-directed therapy within
the past 2 years will be randomized 1:2:2 first to receive app-only, video, or text-based PRISM lay-coaching.
Responders in the video- and text- arms will be randomized 1:1 second to app-only (low) maintenance or text-
based (high) maintenance. Because non-response suggests a demand for more in-person engagement, text
non-responders will be non-randomly assigned to video, and video non-responders will receive referrals to
specialty care. Exploratory analyses will evaluate the role of in-app and digital phenotypic data in detecting
real-time AYA distress. This proposal is significant because early survivorship is highly stressful for AYAs with
cancer, and we propose a scalable, evidence-based program to support AYA resilience. Findings will facilitate
an accessible, sustainable, evidence-based program designed to target and meet the needs of thousands of
AYAs, in turn alleviating the burdens of cancer survivorship and improving their quality of life."

Although evidence in favor of physical activity (PA) for reducing age-related cognitive decline continues
to grow, critical issues for the viability of PA to promote cognitive health are persistently low PA adoption
and adherence in the population. Because PA starts declining at middle-age and neurodegenerative
pathologies increasing dementia risk start decades before cognitive impairment, there is a pressing need
to understand how and why middle-age adults are successful at adopting and sustaining PA. Theoretical
and empirical support have identified self-regulatory capacities as critical for acting on our intentions and
plans to be more physically active, however causal evidence testing whether and how strongly self-
regulatory capacities affect PA behavior change is absent from the literature. Therefore, our objective is
to test the causal role of the self-regulation construct, cognitive control, in PA behavior change among
inactive middle-age adults. Based on the Temporal Self-Regulation Theory (TST) for PA behavior
change, we hypothesize cognitive training designed to improve cognitive control will increase the
success of a PA behavior change program, and that training cognitive control with emotionally valenced
stimuli will further increase PA adherence at moderate-to-vigorous intensities. Our predictions are based
on research showing the importance of cognitive control in PA adherence and maintenance, evidence
that negative affective experiences of PA are common and detrimental to future PA initiation and
maintenance, and research supporting the modifiability of cognitive control with adaptive cognitive
training. We test our overall hypothesis with three aims, including a developmental R61 phase (Aim 1) to
develop and refine a computerized training program targeting aspects of motivation, planning, and
cognitive control theorized to promote PA behavior change, followed by an implementation R33 phase
(Aim 2) with a lab-based, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the extent that cognitive control
for emotionally valenced information is a target mechanism for PA behavior change in inactive middle-
age adults. The RCT implemented in Aim 2 will be tested across rural and urban sites to increase
diversity and generalizability of our sample, which forms the basis for (Aim 3) determining moderators of
intervention efficacy for improving PA behavior change. We predict those with poor cognitive control and
high negative affective experiences to moderate intensity PA will benefit most from cognitive control
training targeted to an affective domain for PA behavior change. Our results will be significant by
determining the causal role of cognitive control and affect in sustainable PA behavior change in the
critical period of midlife. Success will culminate in a scalable training program to boost PA adherence,
setting the stage for personalized and accessible strategies for midlife adults to change their course
towards a more physically active lifestyle and a virtuous cycle of sustained cognitive and physical health."

Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) stand on the brink of a healthcare revolution, providing an unprecedented means of
managing and preventing a myriad of diseases. However, the potential of IMDs is currently impeded by the challenges of
limited interfacing with dispersed neurons, invasive and voluminous designs, and excessive costs, factors that impede their
widespread adoption. This project aims to address these limitations by pioneering a novel generation of IMDs: wireless
microdevices. The proposed devices will be battery-free, injectable microchips capable of deployment anywhere within the
body, integrating energy harvesting, telecommunication functions, and capabilities specific to diverse applications. The
development of the microdevice will necessitate interdisciplinary integration spanning integrated circuits, wireless
powering, materials science, and microfabrication. Key innovations central to this research include the design of compact,
reconfigurable integrated circuits; enhancement of power transfer efficiency; and the application of cost-effective, inkjet
printing-based techniques for efficient device assembly and fabrication. Importantly, this project will introduce for the first
time a precise injection technique designed to enhance placement accuracy and minimize tissue damage. The project's
validation of injectable bioelectric devices in animal models opens avenues for engaging collaboration with neurosurgeons,
neurologists, and industry stakeholders. Together, we envisage translating the technology into clinical trials, implementing
targeted health interventions, and potentially shifting the perception of IMDs from a last-resort solution to an elective option
at earlier disease treatment stages. By developing wireless microdevices that are injectable, scalable, versatile, and fully
addressable, this project represents a technological breakthrough, aiming to redefine the future of implantable medical
devices. This resonates deeply with my career aspiration to be at the forefront of transforming the IMD field."
10910663,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder for which disease-modifying therapies
do not currently exist and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. PD is characterized by
the loss of dopaminergic and other neuronal cell types, and the formation of pathological Lewy body inclusions
containing aggregated α-synuclein protein. Increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein aggregation may
originate in neurons innervating the gastrointestinal tract, and spread to the central nervous system in a prion-
like manner. While rodent models have demonstrated that gut-to-brain spreading of α-synuclein can occur and
results in neurodegeneration and behavioral decline, major challenges associated with the low-throughput nature
of these model systems have hindered progress in the field. To address these issues and significantly accelerate
the rate of discovery of novel disease mechanisms, we propose to generate new gut-to-brain α-synuclein
transmission models in C. elegans, a rapidly aging and highly genetically tractable model organism amenable to
large-scale investigations. We will construct and integrate brain-wide maps of spreading α-synuclein pathology
and neurodegeneration, revealing vulnerable and resilient neuronal cell types in the face of α-synuclein insult
from the gut. To decipher cell type-specific mechanisms that underlie these differential susceptibilities, we will
use a combination of high-throughput screening and single cell RNA-sequencing. Known and predicted cell
surface proteins will be systematically tested for a potential role as novel α-synuclein receptors, facilitating the
toxic invasion of α-synuclein into neurons. Nervous system-wide, single cell transcriptional analyses will provide
powerful insights into both protective and detrimental factors responsible for the fate of neurons in the path of
gut-to-brain α-synuclein transmission. Collectively, this work will constitute the most comprehensive investigation
to date of the mechanisms regulating α-synuclein neurotoxic propagation from the gut, linking cellular- and
molecular-level events at unprecedented resolution, with neuronal degeneration and whole-organism behavioral
dysfunction. Given the accessibility of the human gut to pharmacological and dietary interventions, the results of
this study may inform early therapeutic strategies that hold great promise to halt or even prevent PD progression."
10917017,"This study is aimed to better understand cardiovascular physiological, biomarker, and viral genomic 
heterogeneity changes from influenza infection onset to recovery during normal and differing inflammatory 
states (obesity and antiviral treatment). Thorough investigation of the spatiotemporal inflammatory 
biomarker profile along with the respiratory and cardiovascular physiological profiles from naivety to 
recovery will allow us to explore the interplay between responses to influenza infection in primary site of 
infection and its peripheral effects. The identification of novel biomarkers (molecular and proteomic) 
during an inflammatory event could significantly improve predictions for cardiovascular events. 
Additionally, more thorough genomic investigation of replicating influenza populations can lead to better 
surveillance and prediction of ongoing and emerging events. This study will investigate a major gap in 
knowledge by performing detailed analysis of cardiovascular and molecular changes associated with 
localized respiratory viral infection with obesity and antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis. We hope to 
modify cardiovascular events caused by respiratory virus infection (both during and after) with 
pro-inflammatory state of obese mice or reduction of inflammatory events in a timely manner with varying 
oseltamivir treatment timings. The expectation is to define markers that are present during an influenza 
virus infection that correlate with disease and changes in physiological homeostasis specifically for each 
inflammatory state (proinflammatory caused by obesity and anti-inflammatory caused by antivirals). 
Overall, we hypothesize that a localized inflammatory event in the respiratory system caused by the 
influenza virus infection leads systemic changes in normal cardiovascular physiology, biomarkers, and 
viral genomic heterogeneity that can be altered by obesity and timely admission of antiviral therapeutics."
10913287,"(1) PURPOSE- TBI in Veterans can often be a chronic condition and produce long-term sleep and behavioral
problems. Insomnia in the context of TBI is reported in 30–60% of individuals following TBI and produces
significant morbidity, daytime cognitive problems and impedes the quality of life. This proposal examines the
impact of sleep aberrations and cognitive and behavioral disturbances in a mouse model of chronic TBI (CCI).
Neural ORX dysregulation appears to be a mechanism for sleep and behavioral disturbances and provides an
opportunity to treat with orexinergic agents. We propose to examine the effects of a dual orexin receptor
antagonist treatment (DORA) on sleep, cognition, anxiety, and fearfulness in a mouse model of TBI. (2)
BACKGROUND- (a) Scientific Rationale- ORX activates neural circuits by regulating awake state and arousal,
anxiety, cognition, and other behaviors through widespread neural projections. Because ORX system
abnormalities in the LH develop after TBI, ORX sleep-wake disruptions are hypothesized to contribute to chronic
sleep and behavioral disturbances. Lemborexant (LEM) is a commercially available DORA that blocks orexin
OX1 and OX2 receptors and improves sleep latency and maintenance in primary insomnia in both humans and
animal models. LEM treatment is hypothesized to reverse sleep abnormalities and improve cognition and
daytime behaviors produced by TBI. (b) How This Research Will Advance Biomedical Knowledge- (c)
Significance of the Research and How it Relates to Priority Areas – This grant represents a potential high-
impact translational proposal for a mechanism-based treatment for insomnia and other behavioral disturbances
in chronic TBI. This proposal by experienced investigators (Kaplan and Zielinski) seeks to explore new research
in areas where they have not previously been funded. As such, it responds to RX-20-009 as a TBI Small Project
in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE). (d) Direct Benefits and Quality of Services- If the utility of LEM on sleep
disturbances, anxiety, and cognition can be demonstrated in proposed SPiRE studies, then larger scale studies
using commercially available DORAs in animals and then Veterans with TBI can be pursued. (3) EXPECTED
OUTCOMES OR PRODUCTS– Chronic CCI is anticipated to produce sleep abnormalities including: increased
sleep latency and wake bouts, reduced total sleep time and sleeping bouts, disturbances of REM and NREM
sleep, and sleep fragmentation. LEM is hypothesized to reverse these sleep abnormalities compared to vehicle
treatment. CCI is expected to produce impaired memory in NOR test, greater anxiety as measured by decreased
exploration in LDTT task and increase aberrant FR after FC. It is expected that LEM reverses these behavioral
impairments in the CCI group. CCI is expected to produce reductions of ORX-A and -B levels in LH that are
inversely correlated with sleep and behavioral disturbances. (4) METHODS AND RESEARCH PLAN- We
examine a model of CCI vs. sham CCI in male and female C57BL/6 mice. In Aim 1, we examine the effects of
single- and repeated-dose effects LEM (0, 10, 30, mg/kg) in CCI and sham CCI, at two months post-injury, on
sleep parameters via sleep qEEG (measures of sleep latency, wake time, total sleep, NREM and REM sleep
and delta EEG sleep). In Aim 2, we propose to measure the effects of single- and repeated-dose effects LEM in
CCI on cognition using the NOR task. We examine LEM effects in the LDTT to measure motor behavior and
anxiety in exploring a novel environment. Finally, we measure LEM effects in a fear conditioning test and
measure LEM effects on with cue-induced FR. In Aims 1 and 2, we measure ORX-A and -B levels in LH using
IHC and examine relationships between ORX-A and ORX-B neuropeptide expression and behaviors."
10913439,"ABSTRACT
Mechanical allodynia is a hallmark symptom of chronic pain characterized by painful responses to innocuous
stimuli. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular regulation of this process. Recently, the
mechanically activated Piezo2 channels were identified as key players of mechanical allodynia in mice and
humans, but the molecules and proteins responsible for the sensitization of Piezo2 channels upon injury are
still poorly understood. Recent data from our lab show that activation of Gi-protein coupled receptors induces a
long-lasting potentiation of Piezo2 currents in Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons and HEK293 cells. The
potentiation of Piezo2 currents was abolished by inhibiting the activity of Gβγ. Surprisingly, the inhibition of
Gβγ-downstream kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),
also abolished the potentiation of Piezo2 current suggesting an indirect effect of Gβγ on Piezo2 channels.
Therefore, for aim 1 (Ph.D. progress), we described a novel mechanism of regulation of Piezo2 currents by Gi-
protein coupled receptors. On the other hand, our lab has also shown that activation of Transient Receptor
Potential Vanilloids 1 (TRPV1) channels by capsaicin leads to robust inhibition of Piezo2 currents in DRG
neurons and heterologous systems. This inhibition is abolished by removing Ca2+ from the extracellular
solution, confirming a pivotal role of Ca2+ on Piezo2 channels. Preliminary data in our lab using total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) show that Piezo2 channels are internalized upon activation of TRPV1 channels
in HEK293 cells, but whether Piezo2 channels are internalized via endocytosis is not known. For aim 2 (F99
phase), we hypothesize that activation of TRPV1 induces a Ca2+-triggered endocytosis that orchestrate the
inhibition of Piezo2 currents. We aim to identify molecules and proteins that regulate the activity of the
mechanically activated Piezo2 channels. We hope these novel findings could help us understand the process
of tactile allodynia and investigate the changes that affect the periphery and influence the central nervous
systems (aim 3-K00 phase) with the ultimate goal of providing new avenues for treatments of mechanical-pain
syndromes."

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the U.S. About 250,00 cases and
34,000 deaths from prostate cancer occur each year, making it the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in
U.S. men. Incidence is so high that approximately one in every eight men will be diagnosed with the disease
over their lifetimes, and there are currently an estimated 3.2 million men living with prostate cancer in the U.S.
Due to this high incidence, prostate cancer creates a significant economic burden estimated to total over $13
billion in the U.S. annually. It is well established that androgen signaling drives prostate cancer growth and
metastasis. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy, which inhibits androgen receptor (AR) signaling, is widely used
as first-line therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. However, the majority of patients progress,
with lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Interestingly, despite androgen deprivation,
mCRPC continues to be driven by AR signaling due to the presence of AR splice variants that are constitutively
active in the nucleus. ARMA Bio is developing dual inhibitors of AR-full length (AR-fl) and AR-V7, the most
prevalent splice variant of the androgen receptor in men with mCRPC. AR-V7 expression in patients with mCRPC
is associated with drug resistance and poor survival outcomes. Currently there is no dual AR-fl/AR-V7 inhibitor
on the market, leaving patients with mCRPC with no therapeutic options. A first-in-class dual inhibitor has the
potential to overcome drug resistance, synergize with conventional androgen receptor therapy, and offer a much-
needed therapeutic option for men with mCRPC, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. In this Fast Track
project, ARMA proposes to 1) Perform medicinal chemistry for compound optimization and assess selectivity,
potency, and mechanism of action. 2) Investigate in vivo toxicity and pharmacokinetics. 3) Evaluate efficacy of
lead candidate in mCRPC xenografts. 4) Assess efficacy and synergism with enzalutamide in additional models
including patient-derived xenografts. 5) Perform mechanistic studies as a foundation for clinical biomarker
development. 6) Perform GLP manufacturing and IND-enabling toxicology studies. Ultimately, this work will
identify a lead compound and provide proof-of-principle data to advance the goal of developing a first-in-class
pharmacologic inhibitor of AR-fl/AR-V7. This inhibitor could be readily combined with existing anti-androgen
receptor treatments to not only reverse, but also prevent, the onset of AR-V7-mediated drug resistance, thereby
benefiting patients with earlier stages of disease."

Ju Dong Yang, MD, MS is a faculty in the Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the Samuel
Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and a health sciences assistant
clinical professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Yang`s long-term career goal is to become a
physician-scientist in precision medicine-based diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Dr.
Yang`s long-term research objective is to translate novel biomarker discovery into clinical practice by
determining the utility of novel liquid biopsy technology in early detection of cancer development and
progression, assessment and prediction of treatment response, and prognosis. To achieve his long-term
career goal and research objectives, Dr. Yang set up short-term career goals of gaining skills in 1) liquid biopsy
biotechnologies, 2) prospective patient recruitment and monitoring, 3) advanced biostatistics for longitudinal
data analysis, and bioinformatics for large scale transcriptomic data analysis and marker panel selection, and 4)
leadership and research grant writing. HCC is a biologically aggressive tumor and one of the leading causes of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. Following cancer treatment, patients undergo radiologic tests for evaluation
of treatment response. However, post-treatment radiologic assessment could be obscured due to treatment-
related non-specific changes. The main objective of Dr. Yang's K08 proposal is to investigate the performance
of novel circulating biomarker digital scores for evaluation of HCC treatment response. Recently, Dr. Tseng
(Co-Primary mentor) has developed a streamlined HCC extracellular vesicles (EV) digital scoring assay that
couples two robust technologies, i.e., EV Click Chip for purification of HCC EVs and reverse-transcription
droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) for quantification of HCC-specific mRNA markers with outstanding
performance for early-stage HCC detection. Dr. Yang demonstrated that the GALAD score, derived from three
HCC protein tumor markers (AFP-L3, AFP, and Des-carboxyprothrombin) is highly accurate for the detection of
early-stage HCC. Both scores reflect tumor burden and our pilot data showed their promising performance in
assessing treatment response. Thus, the central hypothesis of the project is that pre- and post-treatment HCC
EV digital score, GALAD score, and integration of two independent scores (i.e., HCC EV-GALAD digital score)
can evaluate HCC treatment response. Dr. Yang will conduct phase 2 and 3 biomarker studies to test the

Our goal is to recruit, train and develop the next generation of leaders in cancer research. To achieve this
objective, we will implement the Integrative Cancer Scholars (ICS) program as described in this competitive
renewal of our long-standing Cancer Biology Training Program. ICS is an innovative predoctoral and
postdoctoral fellows training program that embraces a paired-mentor team approach to maximize the impact
and significance of cancer research. Specifically, Scholars choose one basic science mentor and one clinical
science mentor from among nationally competitive basic and physician scientists. From the mentor pair, the
Scholar selects a `lead' mentor from among the faculty with well-funded collaborative research programs with a
broad range of cancer research specialties: Genomic and Epigenetic Instability, Tumor Microenvironment,
Cancer Prevention and Control, Developmental Therapeutics, Cancer Imaging, Tumor Viruses and
Immunology, Tumor Progression and Metastasis, and Cancer Pain. ICS is a unique program with distinct
training events designed to integrate current molecular and clinical cancer concepts. Each Scholar is expected
to conduct original cutting-edge research under the guidance of the mentor-pair and to participate in clinical
cases with their chosen physician mentor. Progress of each trainee is ensured through compulsory committee
meetings and annual evaluations by the mentor-pair. Scholars also participate in career development and
national networking opportunities, including hosting thought leaders in our Cancer Biology Seminar Series,
acquiring new targeted skills in educational workshops, and community engagement with oncologists and
biotechnology experts. Additionally, Scholars are provided support to travel and present their work at a national
meeting. ICS is associated with the Cancer Biology Graduate Interdisciplinary Program which provides
instruction in cancer causation, epidemiology, prevention, and grant writing through specific coursework and a
symposium featuring presentations of pre- and postdoctoral research. The postdoctoral training plan ensures
that each trainee navigates a path of comprehensive training, leading to a mature scholarship and ability to
conduct independent, cutting-edge research. The program is designed to expose each trainee to the range of
current thought in the cancer field, to teach state-of-the-art laboratory techniques, to emphasize critical thinking
skills, to introduce real-world aspects of clinical work, and to refine their career-development skills, particularly
in networking, communication and grant/manuscript preparation. Pre- and postdoctoral researchers from
laboratories of the participating mentors are eligible for ICS support, and Scholars are selected through a
competitive process. Support from the UA, state-of-the-art research core facilities, and opportunities for
underrepresented-minority researchers (UA is top of all Research I institutions for URMs in graduate school)
round out a rich environment for training the future leaders of cancer research."

This program is an extension of our successful HIV basic science training program with the HIV Cure Research
Infrastructure Studies (H-CRIS) based at the University of Ghana - an ongoing collaboration between
Washington University in St. Louis (WU) and the University of Ghana (UG). Finding a permanent cure for people
living with HIV, a key priority for the NIH, requires rigorous and inclusive basic science research. The main
obstacle to an HIV cure is the persistence of transcriptionally silent and immunologically unrecognizable
proviruses in quiescent memory CD4+ T cell reservoirs in people who are on ART. Although over 70% of HIV
patients live in Africa, very little of the basic science of cure research involves African patients or
scientists. This is a clear deficiency in the cure research efforts that needs immediate remedy. Most HIV basic
science research on cure has been conducted in the USA and Europe in Caucasians and on one viral subtype
(HIV subtype B). However, Africa has a wide patient genetic diversity and a variety of viral subtypes, including
A, C, G, and recombinant forms such as CRF2_AG, CRF2_AE, HIV-2, and others which can all affect the latent
viral reservoir. In addition, African patients also have co-infections like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and malaria which
can all determine CD4+ T cell responses. Africa also has different social situations that may determine whether
people will participate in future cure trials. Therefore, training African scientists in HIV basic science will help
account for these deficiencies in the cure research efforts.
Since 2018, a partnership between WU and UG has set up the HIV Cure Research Infrastructure Studies (H-
CRIS) at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, UG. H-CRIS is training graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in HIV basic science and cure research with outstanding success; many of the trainees have
obtained independent grant funding. For the five years of the proposed D43 program, we expect to enroll 3
PhDs (4-year program), 4 MPhil (2-year masters with a laboratory research thesis) and provide a two-
year intensive basic laboratory research training and mentorship for 4 postdoctoral fellows (11 trainees
in all). In addition, our grants and manuscript writing workshops will be open to students and faculty at the UG
and expected to benefit over 80 additional scientists at the University of Ghana. The predominant site for the
training will be the UG, with medium- and short-term experiences at WU. Our specific aims are:
1. To build capacity and experience at the University of Ghana for basic science researchers to design and
conduct HIV cure-related research in Ghana.
2. To equip trainees with research skills through 2-year intensive and mentored postdoctoral research projects
focused on HIV basic science and cure.
3. To establish and maintain a mentorship plan for trainees at UG who aspire to become independently funded
investigators in the basic science of HIV research."
10914059,"The overall objective of this UO1 application is to advance the development of BPN-27473, a potent, selective
and orally active GABA-A α5 Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) for the treatment of Mild Cognitive
Impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease (MCI due to AD). As yet, no treatment has shown significant and
reliable therapeutic efficacy on the progression of AD in patients making this an area of extremely high unmet
need. There is strong support from preclinical AD models and human patients, particularly in this early stage
of AD, that neuronal circuits in the hippocampus become excessively active contributing to neuronal pathology
and brain dysfunction. AgeneBio’s GABA-A α5 PAM program represents a novel approach to addressing the
excess hippocampal activity in this patient population at high risk for dementia.
The concept that reduction of hippocampal overactivity is therapeutically beneficial is supported by recent
preclinical and clinical studies using the atypical antiepileptic levetiracetam. Ranging from research on age-
associated memory impairment in rodents to clinical studies in patients with amnestic MCI, beneficial effects on
key circuits in the medial temporal lobe/hippocampus and on memory performance have been demonstrated
by treatment at low doses of levetiracetam that reduce hippocampal overactivity. The strong hippocampal
localization of GABA-A α5 receptors coupled with its role to control tonic inhibition make GABA-A α5 PAMs
well suited to reduce the excess hippocampal activity in MCI due to AD.
BPN-27473 has been well characterized and is a potent, highly selective and orally active GABA-A α5 PAM
that meets discovery in vitro and in vivo criteria. BPN-27473 shows good in vivo receptor occupancy and
studies in rats with age-associated memory loss (a model which shows hippocampal overactivity) demonstrate
that BPN-27473 is effective on improving memory performance after both acute and chronic administration. A
rat dose-range finding study has shown that doses > 15-fold the MED do not have limiting safety or toxicity
liabilities. A suitable scaleup process to enable manufacture large quantities of material has been
demonstrated.
The current proposal will expand both non-GMP and GMP scale up of BPN-27473 manufacture to enable
sufficient supplies for the completion IND-enabling safety studies in rats and dogs/monkeys. Formulation and
drug product development will be completed to have a suitable dosage form for Phase I studies. A pre-IND
meeting will be requested from the FDA and the IND will be submitted. A Phase 1 single ascending dose study
in healthy elderly volunteers will be completed. These studies will enable a thorough understanding of the
safety and tolerability of BPN-27473 and its utility for further clinical development."
10914060,"ABSTRACT
Polygenic scores — summaries of the genomic contribution to risk and resilience for biomedical traits — are an
emerging and promising approach for clinical risk assessment and personalized medicine. Minoritized groups,
such as gender minorities, do not currently benefit from insights gained via studies of polygenic scores
because these groups have not been sufficiently included or characterized in this research. This disparity must
be addressed both by inclusion during recruitment as well as consideration of the effects of
heterogeneity during analysis. For example, our preliminary data show striking dissociations in suicide risk as
influenced by polygenic scores. Notably, these opposing associations are apparent only when gender diversity
status (i.e., cisgender; gender-diverse) is modeled, underscoring the imperative to parsing the heterogeneity of
such associations by both sex and gender. These results suggest value in genomic research for gender
minority groups to understand both innate risk and resilience. The promise of genomic research informed by
designated sex, gender, and their interaction (i.e., gender diversity) depends on the ability to rigorously and
equitably include and characterize individuals across the spectra of designated sex and gender.
Currently, biomedical research relies on checklist or write-in gender identity descriptors, which do not capture
the continuous and simultaneous nature of dimensional binary and nonbinary gender experiences and result in
statistically underpowered analytics with far too few individuals within each gender self-descriptor category.
This perpetuates the exclusion of gender and its intersection with designated sex in genetic research. We
propose to close this gap by calibrating and genetically characterizing the Gender Self-Report (GSR), a novel
and broadly disseminable method for obtaining multidimensional gender for genomic research and broader
research applications. First, we will facilitate partnership between scientists and gender diverse community
stakeholders, and reduce paternalistic tendencies in this ethically complex field of research, by building on our
established community partnerships with a purposively recruited stakeholder panel (N=50) to provide a final
version of the GSR itemset. Next, to advance the dimensional characterization of gender identity and gender
diversity in a genomic research context, we will validate the stakeholder-refined GSR in a large sample
(N=10,000) of genotyped neurotypical and neurodivergent adults, enriched across broad experiences of
gender diversity. Finally, to demonstrate proof-of-principle for how designated sex, gender, and gender
diversity contextualize patterns of association with polygenic scores, we will measure key health
outcomes (both mental and physical), in a large, genetically informed sample enriched for neurodiversity (e.g.,
autism) and broad gender diversity. The proposed research will provide value to gender minority groups by
seeking a better understanding of how polygenic scores apply specifically to them, and not just the cisgender
proportional majority."
10914226,"Abstract
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal malignancies due largely to their lack
of response to current cytotoxic, targeted, and immune therapies. PDAC tumor tissues harbor an expansive,
desmoplastic stroma that both suppresses angiogenesis and limits perfusion and diffusion. Consequently,
delivery of therapeutic agents through systemic administration is impeded, lowering drug efficacy and
increasing general toxicity. Indeed, multiple components of the PDAC stroma support its survival and growth,
for example by conditioning a locally immunosuppressed microenvironment that facilitates tumor survival.
Conversely, we previously showed that at least some elements of the tumor stromal restrain PDAC growth and
progression, for example Hedgehog pathway-responsive myofibroblasts. Early attempts to modulate the PDAC
stroma in order to facilitate drug delivery failed upon clinical translation. Post-clinical trials ultimately
demonstrated that stromal remodulation upon inhibition of individual pathways can lead to unpredictable
consequences in multiple additional cell types. Based on these data, we hypothesize that individual paracrine
pathways typically link together to form “paracrine cascades” that propagate through multiple pathways and
cell types. We advance that reconstructing these paracrine cascades offers both the opportunity to better
understand the consequences of therapeutic intervention and also to infer candidate targets that act on a
broad range of cell types within the PDAC TME to enact stromal remodulation.
 In order to test this, we will make use of a series of innovative systems biology tools built by members of
our transdisciplinary team. These include a suite of algorithms leveraging the computational field of regulatory
network analysis, as well as technically innovative techniques for studying outcomes in single cell datasets.
Moreover, we will acquire unique dataset from samples collected by members of our multidisciplinary clinical
service at the Pancreas Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital. These include acquiring human PDAC
tumor interstitial fluid and generating matched sets of tumor, normal pancreas, spleen, and blood samples from
PDAC patients. We will also routinely utilize fresh PDAC tissue samples to make tumor “explants” a novel ex
vivo model system for the short-term, medium throughput study of PDAC. This new model system enables the
dissection of complex multi-cellular phenotypes in ways that are not possible through study of intact tumors or
co-cultures of purified cell types
 Using these approaches, we will reconstruct the network of paracrine cascades in PDAC and validate
selected candidates experimentally. We will also test a specific candidate pathway uncovered through study of
the Hh pathway that connects myofibroblasts to myeloid derived suppressor cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes.
We expect that the proposed studies will provide an expansive understanding of paracrine crosstalk in PDAC
and also provide multiple valuable resources and techniques to the PSRC consortium."
10914855,"The Tsepamo birth outcomes surveillance study has accrued many thousands of women living with HIV from
Botswana. The Tsepamo Plus study (Project 1) will continue to collect ARV exposures in pregnancy which are
rarely studied with high precision. Because Tsepamo can provide high precision when there is much uncertainty
about safety in pregnancy and Botswana typically rolls out new ARVs before other African countries, Tsepamo
may be the first to report on novel safety signals. This in turn makes Tsepamo highly influential in the
understanding of adverse ARV effects in pregnancy. Moreover, surveillance data alone can and should be used
to inform personal, clinical, or societal decision-making, especially when randomized trials are too costly,
unethical, or not timely enough. The objectives of this proposal are to evaluate methodologies and provide
guidance on methods for making best use of Tsepamo data and similar studies. Specifically, we aim to create
guidance on when to publicly report on safety signals based on unplanned analyses; evaluate the statistical
properties of various group sequential methods; develop and implement methods to benchmark results from
Tsepamo with results from a randomized trial; and develop and improve triangulation strategies within
pregnancy-related surveillance data."
10917034,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this F32 fellowship project and training plan is to prepare the candidate to independently
conduct innovative research aimed at improving our understanding of suicide risk and preventing suicidal
behaviors (SB) in high-risk populations. Despite decades of suicide risk research, our ability to predict and
prevent suicide is inadequate,24 and suicide rates continue to rise.37 Among young adults ages 18-35,
suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death.37 The proposed research is critical to understanding and reducing
suicide during the high-risk developmental period of young adulthood. Social pain and social exclusion are
theoretically and empirically associated with suicide ideation and SB, but the mechanisms by which social
pain leads to SB are largely untested. The central hypothesis is that a maladaptive response to social pain
(elicited by perceived chronic social exclusion) leads to impaired decision-making (deficits in value
comparisons) and blunted physiological reactivity (blunted sympathetic arousal and blunted
parasympathetic withdrawal), which is associated with SB. To test this hypothesis, virtual reality (VR)
simulation, a valid and safe laboratory proxy for SB, 39,50 will be used in combination with highly sensitive
objective measures of cognition and physiological arousal. These mechanisms will be examined in a
transdiagnostic sample of 125 young adults (ages 18-35) with recent suicide ideation and/or SB. This
multi-method study is a within-person crossover design, in which the sequence of the social exclusion
manipulation (exclusion vs. neutral control) is randomized across participants. Participants complete
decision-making tasks and VR suicide scenarios with physiological assessment, as well as interview and
self-report measures of suicide risk and social exclusion at pre-, post-, and 4-month follow-up. This study
has two specific aims: 1) Identify cognitive and physiological mechanisms linking social pain and
engagement in VR SB scenarios; 2) Determine the predictive value of laboratory-derived cognitive and
physiological mechanisms for future real-world SB and the potential moderators (e.g., rejection
sensitivity, perceptions of rejection) of these associations. My study will provide causal evidence for 2
modifiable mechanisms for SB: impaired decision-making and physiological arousal. This is critical to
improving our assessment, prediction, and treatment of SB. This is the fundamental step towards my
long-term goal of isolating key mechanisms in the real-world and developing effective interventions (e.g.,
attentional or cognitive bias modification,84,85 real-time biofeedback86) targeting mechanisms at critical
time points to reduce SB. With the proposed training and research plan, the candidate will develop
expertise in physiological, cognitive, and VR methodology, as well as the practical, clinical, and statistical
skills necessary to conduct cutting-edge research on suicide risk with high-risk populations."
10917060,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 3.1 million adolescents are diagnosed with depression each year with over 60% not receiving or
engaging in mental health care. In an effort to address the significant challenges in access to and engagement
with evidence-based psychosocial interventions (EBPIs) for adolescent depression, investigators in the
University of Washington’s Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences (MPI Jenness) and Human
Centered Design and Engineering (MPI Kientz) partnered to conduct pilot work addressing these challenges
through the use of Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) supported behavioral activation (BA+ARC). ARCs
are technology-mediated groups that use private online platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to deliver weekly
tasks to participants and includes features such as asynchronous therapist and chatbot coaching, ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) of mood, activity, and skill-use tracking, and peer communities that aim to
improve support and motivation to engage in therapy and behavior change. Pilot work included successful design
and development of a preliminary BA+ARC prototype (ActivaTeen) that was found to be acceptable, usable, and
engaging to clinician and patient target users. The present proposal responds to PAR-21-131 “Pilot
Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions” and aims to advance this pilot
work by conducting a mixed-methods study that 1) builds and conducts usability testing on a functional, usable,
and robust BA+ARC platform that will satisfy the needs of mental health clinicians and adolescent patients
identified through our pilot study (e.g., data security, HIPAA compliance, clinician workflow integration), and 2)
tests the feasibility, usability, and change in proposed target mechanisms and outcomes of BA+ARC compared
to BA treatment only (BA-Only) within a moderately-sized randomized control trial conducted within our partner
site’s outpatient psychiatry clinic. We hypothesize 1) BA+ARC target users will report increased acceptability,
feasibility, usability, and less burden than users of BA-Only; 2) BA+ARC adolescents will demonstrate
improvements on hypothesized treatment mechanisms including therapist alliance, timeliness of intervention,
social belongingness, and greater engagement in care compared to BA-Only adolescents; 3) Adolescents
treated by BA+ARC versus BA+Only will have improved outcomes in depression symptoms and diagnoses and
functional impairments. This research addresses the broader NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 4.3: Develop
innovative service delivery models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services
received in diverse communities and populations by investigating a novel, technology-mediated service
model that has the potential to improve access to and effectiveness of EBPIs for adolescent depression."

In this K08 career development award, the principal investigator (PI) aims to determine how DNA-methylation is
altered after DNA damage and investigate the impact of these changes on 3D chromatin organization, gene
regulation and treatment resistance. The PI studies this process in glioblastoma, a difficult to treat malignant
brain tumor. Training and mentoring activities will facilitate meeting not only scientific goals, but also the principal
investigator's career development by addressing gaps in knowledge and expanding training through coursework,
meetings, networking, and an expert mentoring team consisting of a primary mentor, co-mentor, and four faculty
advisors. The research proposed will be addressed through this K08 phase of training and serve as the scientific
basis for the applicant's career as an independent investigator. The candidate will acquire skills necessary to
complete the aims through selected mentors with non-overlapping expertise and coursework. The central
hypothesis is that, after DNA damage repair, the local epigenetic state is not restored correctly, leading to
epigenetic alterations, gene expression changes and treatment resistance. This hypothesis is tested using
human patient-derived glioblastoma cell cultures as a model system. The rationale for this project is the
observation that stochastic DNA methylation alterations can be detected with radiation damage models, and
endonuclease damage can alter local DNA methylation states. The mechanism underlying this process and the
extent to which it occurs in cancer, however, is not known. This hypothesis is challenging to test using stochastic
damage, such as radiation, or traditional endonuclease damage models, which are unable to cut methylated
DNA, and have a fixed and limited number of sites. To circumvent this issue, the investigator developed a
CRISRP-Cas9 tool to reproducibly induce genome-wide double strand breaks to study DNA methylation
alterations and genome organization around sites of DNA damage. The central hypothesis will be tested by two
specific aims to (i) test how DNA methylation and genome organizational alterations evolve at damaged DNA
loci, and (ii) test if genome re-organization factors can be targeted therapeutically during radiation stress. This
training proposal is innovative because it (i) develops tools to map DNA methylation and 3D chromatin
organization alterations following DNA damage and (ii) implicates this process in treatment resistance. The
significance of this proposed research is that it fills knowledge gaps in epigenetics, DNA-damage repair, and the
understanding of the effects of treatment on cancer cells. Successful completion of these studies will provide
translatable insight into the interplay between DNA damage, DNA methylation and genome re-organization in
glioblastoma."
10917381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), are deleterious malignant
pediatric tumors of the brainstem. DMG is the leading cause of death among pediatric brain tumors and the
second most common malignant brain cancer afflicting children. DMG has a dismal prognosis of less than 1%
survival within a year of diagnosis, even when using the most aggressive treatments. Approximately 400 children
will be diagnosed with DIPG in the United States in 2022, all of whom will have a median survival of between 8
and 11 months. DMG disease outcomes have plateaued over the past decade due to the lack of effective
treatments and limited diagnostic tools. Many failed clinical trials and therapeutic strategies in DMG can be
attributed to two critical concerns: 1) the selectively penetrable blood brain barrier (BBB) restricts drug delivery
to central nervous system, and 2) despite there being distinct genetic alterations between DMG and adult high-
grade gliomas (aHGG), the agents considered for DMG clinical trials have been derived by extrapolation from
aHGG data, without grounds for the therapeutic translation. Studies have revealed extracellular signal-regulated
protein kinases (ERK), a downstream receptor tyrosine kinase of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), is
upregulated in DMG, raising questions about whether targeting the MAPK/ERK pathway can have anti-tumor
effects in DMG. Targeting MEK in combination with aminolevulinic acid-photodynamic therapy (5-ALA-PDT) is
of interest because inhibition of MEK has been found to significantly enhance protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)
accumulation in vitro and in vivo in a tumor-specific manner. This proposal uses an innovative multimodal
treatment approach that addresses the barriers to successful DMG clinical trials and exploits the molecular
composition of DMG cells to reduce morbidity and mortality. By targeting MEK and employing 5-ALA-PDT, we
anticipate MEK inhibition will synergize with 5-ALA-PDT efficacy by eliciting direct tumor cell killing, vascular
shutdown and immune response, ultimately increasing overall patient survival. If successful, this treatment can
be applied to other inoperable CNS tumors."

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate a fivefold increase in the number of deaths due to
opioids from 1999 to 2016. Neuroimaging is a powerful tool in understanding the neurocircuitry and physiology
of OUD in order to target treatments for patients suffering from this disorder. This K23 application presents a
training program for a board-certified clinical medical physicist, who specializes in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), in order to receive training in the neuroscience of substance use disorders and to become an
independent investigator. The goals set in this application will build on the candidate’s imaging physics
background by (1) developing a foundational knowledge of brain function and neurocircuitry in substance use
disorders in order to design, optimize, and interpret advanced neuroimaging techniques for addiction research;
(2) acquiring training in professional development to become an independent investigator, mentor and
educator; and (3) receiving additional training in the responsible and ethical conduct of scientific research. The
overall training program will involve a research study focused on (1) brain effective connectivity (i.e., directional
connectivity) of neural circuits in OUD, and (2) magnetic resonance spectroscopic quantification of
neurotransmitters related to these circuits. In this proposed work, we will employ fMRI-based dynamic causal
modeling of effective connectivity with guided expertise from mentors in order to identify neurocircuits
underlying drug craving and attentional bias to dug cues. In addition, we will use MR spectroscopy to
investigate the neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in OUD and their relation
to drug craving and attentional bias, and to explore the association of these neurotransmitters with brain
effective connectivity."
10908292,"Project Summary
The past decade has witnessed explosive advances in our understanding of how the organization of
chromatin controls gene expression in eukaryotes. Much of the work delineating these mechanisms has
contributed to the notion that a so-called ‘Histone Code,’ which refers to the landscape of histone post-
translational modifications (PTMs), is a central determinant of a gene's potential to be activated or
repressed in response to environmental stimuli. However, although detected in vivo, very little is known
about how non-enzymatic covalent modifications (NECMs), such as glycation, affect the established
cellular transcriptional program. We recently found that glycation, which is the hallmark of diabetes,
accumulates on histones in a disease state-dependent manner (Zheng et al. Nature Communications,
2019). Using a variety of biophysical, biochemical and genetic methods we found that histone glycation
disrupts regulatory histone PTMs as well as changes chromatin architecture in vitro and in cells by forming
both histone-histone and histone-DNA crosslinks. Importantly, we identified a cellular regulatory response
to this damage in the form of the deglycase DJ-1 as well as more recently, an arginine-specific deglycase,
PAD4, which further demonstrates the crosstalk between histone glycation and other enzymatic PTMs
(Zheng et al., in revision). In this proposal, we will take an interdisciplinary approach and leverage new
chemical probes we developed to determine the sites of glycation on histones and their distribution within
chromatin. In addition, we will perform a high-resolution analysis to identify the precise mechanistic effect
histone glycation has on higher-order chromatin structure and the epigenetic landscape. Finally, we will
investigate the cellular response to glycation by identifying “readers” and “erasers” of this new mark.
Successful completion of this project is expected to yield a detailed molecular mechanism linking a new
class of histone modifications to transcription regulation, thus providing essential insights into a
fundamental biological problem and opening the door to new therapeutic avenues."
10908374,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are rare heterogeneous mesenchymal tumors that have more than 75 subtypes. STSs are
understudied tumors for which there are few established research models and a lack of funding sources. Over decades,
there has been little improvement in the therapeutic strategies for STSs, which are often resistant to current therapies
and can be frequently fatal as 50% of patients develop metastasis in distant organs. To solve this unmet clinical problem,
in vivo models that accurately recapitulate this spectrum of cancers provide a unique and effective platform for studying
sarcoma biology and preclinical trials before novel therapeutic strategies translate to limited population of sarcoma
patients. However, there are very few in vivo sarcoma models available because the tumor suppressor and oncogenic
drivers for sarcoma development and metastasis remain unknown. Therefore, I performed genome-wide in vitro genetic
screens and direct in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens in wild type mice to identify driver genes whose mutation is
required for sarcoma initiation. From these screens, I generate a novel in vivo sarcoma model driven by the mutation of
Fat1 which is frequently mutated in human STSs. This is a de novo in vivo model that recapitulates a subset of human
STSs and, to our knowledge, the first determination that Fat1 is a potent tumor suppressor in human STSs. Furthermore,
using in vivo sarcoma models and high throughput RNA sequencing, I also identified the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
Neat1 as an oncogenic driver for sarcoma metastasis. This K22 award will allow me to build my own research platform to
further characterize the critical signaling pathways and target genes in sarcoma development and metastasis using these
unique in vivo sarcoma models. In Specific Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanism by which the Hippo pathways and their
effectors Yap1/Taz drive sarcomas through the mutation of Fat1. In addition, we will use my novel in vivo sarcoma
models to test and optimize the best combination treatment strategies that suppress sarcoma tumor growth. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which lncRNA Neat1 drives sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary results
suggest that RNA splicing regulating genes, such as Khsrp, interact with Neat1 and promote sarcoma metastasis. We will
use my unique in vivo sarcoma models to dissect the mechanisms governing sarcoma metastasis and the implications of
these genes for targeted therapies in treating metastatic sarcoma patients. In conclusion, completion of this proposal
will determine the functional consequences of expression of the coding gene Fat1 and the non-coding gene Neat1 in
sarcoma development and metastasis and provide novel candidate pathways and genes for designing effective targeted
therapies to improve outcomes for sarcoma patients."
10908376,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the United States, young women with early-stage breast cancer are increasingly choosing to have their
unaffected breast removed, a procedure known as contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) or bilateral
(“double”) mastectomy. The clinical benefits of CPM (e.g., no survival benefit) are minimal and there are
documented harms, including an increased risk of surgical complications and the potential for negative quality
of life sequelae. Additionally, the American Society of Breast Surgeons and Choosing Wisely guidelines
recommend against the routine use of CPM among average risk women with unilateral breast cancer. Prior
research has suggested that the risks and benefits of breast cancer surgery are not being optimally
communicated and that some women have inaccurate perceptions about breast cancer risks that are likely
impacting their choice of surgery. Life-stage specific factors (e.g., breastfeeding, body image) can make surgical
decisions particularly complex for young women and young women report high levels of decisional conflict
regarding the surgical decision. To optimally support young women making decisions about breast cancer
surgery, we developed CONSYDER, a web-based decision support tool tailored to the unique concerns of young
patients. In our pilot study, all women who used CONSYDER found it helped them understand the pros and cons
of surgery and clarify their values around this highly preference sensitive decision. CONSYDER is innovative in
its approach to decision support in that integrates supportive care resources to help manage stress and anxiety
around diagnosis as part of the decision tool. These resources were valued by patients, demonstrating the
acceptability of this approach that acknowledges their psychosocial needs. We are now proposing a pragmatic,
stepped-wedge, multicenter trial that incorporates a Type II hybrid effectiveness-implementation design. We will
test the effectiveness of CONSYDER in reducing decisional conflict before surgery among 800 young women
seeing a breast cancer surgeon at Yale Smilow Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, and Duke Cancer Institute. Concurrently, we will use a mixed-methods approach, including surveys
and semi-structured interviews with patients and providers, to evaluate the value and implementation of
CONSYDER. Implementation outcomes will include feasibility of delivery, adoption and fidelity across sites,
uptake of key features, and sustainability. Our pragmatic study will test the effectiveness and implementation of
an intervention designed to promote shared decision-making and reduce decisional conflict in young women with
breast cancer. We expect findings from the proposed study not only to demonstrate the effectiveness of this
novel intervention but also to inform the optimal delivery and broader dissemination of CONSYDER, enabling
patient-centered support for the highest quality preference-sensitive decisions for young women with breast

The presence of an extra copy of human chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) is associated with Down syndrome (DS),
and this is the most common live-born chromosomal alteration in humans. In the United States, DS has an
incidence rate of approximately 1 in 691 newborns, and individuals with DS exhibit many clinical phenotypes;
nervous system involvement is among the most burdensome. Today, human trisomy 21 remains a leading
genetic cause of developmental delays and intellectual disabilities with near universal penetrance. Effective
treatments for such clinical manifestations would be transformative because these treatments could profoundly
improve the quality of life for individuals with DS. Based on the prevailing hypothesis that particular phenotypes
of DS are affected by the dosage increase of specific genes on human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), triplications of
particular genomic segments, i.e., human segmental trisomies, have been studied in detail to establish
genotype–phenotype relationships with the ultimate goal of identifying dosage sensitive causative genes that
can serve as therapeutic targets. However, such efforts have been severely hampered by the lack of an adequate
number of informative segmental trisomy cases. Fortunately, amore fruitful alternative based on the evolutionary
conservation between humans and mice has also been pursued, and this approach has allowed the genetic
dissection efforts to advance much more rapidly. For example, analyses of the DYRK1A gene ortholog in mice
demonstrated that this gene is a causative determinant for DS-associated developmental cognitive deficits;
subsequently, these results served as the basis for the only successful clinical trials involving developmental
cognitive deficits and orthologous Hsa21 genes. To further the genetic dissection efforts, we have developed a
large number of mouse mutants carrying different chromosomal rearrangements in Hsa21 orthologous regions.
In Aim 1 of this application, we will utilize these mouse mutants and develop new mutants by using CRISPR -
mediated genome engineering to enhance our efforts to identify novel dosage sensitive causative genes
underlying developmental cognitive deficits in DS, whose human orthologs can serve as therapeutic targets
along with the DYRK1A gene. Besides acting through a gene dosage increase, human trisomy 21 may have
other ways of influencing phenotypes, such as by altering the nuclear architecture and thus gene expression. In
Aim 2 of this application, we will test this second hypothesis by using mouse models. We believe the success of
our proposed project will have a transformative impact on research on DS in general and on DS-associated
developmental cognitive deficits in particular."

 Hypertension affects nearly half of the population and it is the principal risk factor for heart attack and stroke,
the leading first and third cause of death in the United States.
 The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is one of the most studied mechanisms of blood pressure control. The
classical view of the RAS involves a sequential cleavage of the substrate angiotensinogen resulting in the
elevation of circulating angiotensin II (ANG). In addition to functioning within the circulation as a classical
(endocrine) hormone system, several tissues including the brain produce local acting ANG, supporting the
concept that autocrine/paracrine/intracrine versions of the RAS act locally within these tissues.
 However, this scientific premise has been challenged due to the difficulties to detect renin in extrarenal
organs. Indeed, the enzymes catalyzing the hydrolytic removal of the prosegment, which is required for the
activation of renin, are absent in extrarenal tissues. Utilizing cutting edge molecular techniques with superior
specificity and sensitivity we were able to identify specific cells located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM)
that express renin. We also observed that in a model of neurogenic hypertension, such as mice lacking the
alternative renin isoform (renin-b), there is a disinhibition of the classical renin isoform (renin-a) encoding
preprorenin within the RVLM. This data has been our driving force to interrogate what is the function of renin-
expressing cells within the RVLM, and moreover, are these cells initiating ANG signaling within the areas
adjacent to the RVLM by secreting prorenin to the extracellular space which is abundant of angiotensinogen? A
key step to answer these questions is to decipher how prorenin is activated. The discovery of prorenin receptor
(PRR), a receptor that binds prorenin and induces its activation without the cleavage of the prosegment, might
be a key player to solve this problem. In the recent years, several ANG-independent and (pro)renin-independent
functions of PRR have been demonstrated. Since then, the role of PRR mediating the local activation of the RAS
has been questioned. Given the long-held controversy in this field, our fundamental goal is to clarify the
physiological and molecular role of PRR within the RVLM and then to dissociate the actions that are dependent
of the RAS versus those that are independent of the generation of ANG. Finally, we propose a transcriptomic
approach to identify the neuronal and molecular signature of the renin-expressing cells within the RVLM.
 Collectively, this project will facilitate continued technical, intellectual, and professional training for the
candidate, and assist in the establishment of an independent research laboratory at an academic research
institution."

Rationale: PSA screening detects too many low risk prostate cancers (PCas) and subjects too many men to
prostate biopsy (PB). Hence, new diagnostic tests with improved specificity for aggressive PCa are needed.
Prostate Health Index (PHI) measures 3 kallikrein isoforms and has been validated in multiple cohorts in
Europe and the US for prediction of Gleason grade ≥3+4 clinically significant (cs) PCa at PB. The test could
prevent 30-58% of unnecessary PBs at a cost of deferring or missing detection of very few high-grade PCas.16-
18 Multi-parametric MRI of the prostate (MP-MRI) is similarly promising for detecting Gleason ≥3+4 PCa.8,18,19
The PROMIS study from the UK resulted in a 27% reduction in unnecessary PBs with few missed cancers.19
However, both tests low specificity still subjects over half of men to unnecessary PB. Moreover, there is limited
validation in Black men and almost no validation in Hispanics, thus precluding meaningful estimates of
predictive accuracy in a high-risk and a growing population.18 Our long-term goal is to cost-effectively
reduce PCa over-detection and unnecessary prostate biopsies.
Brief Description: Aim 1 is an observational study to identify effective thresholds of PHI and MRI used alone, in
series (i.e. PHI +/- MP-MRI and MP-MRI+/-PHI) or in parallel (PHI & MRI) for detecting csPCa. Aim 2 is a study
to determine the most cost-effective strategy by race. Aim 3 will assess the csPCas that were missed by MRI
by careful pathologic review and highlighting the missed csPCa for corroboration on MP-MRI to see if they
were truly not present on the MRI. All regions will be assigned a PIRADS Score. csPCas not seen on MRI will
be characterized for Gleason grade, tumor size and extracapsular extension. We will also look for other
aggressive features like comedonecrosis, cribriform histology, intraductal carcinoma, neuroendocrine
differentiation, and lymphovascular and perineural invasion. We will address these objectives with the following
Specific Aims:
 1) Identify the biopsy strategies with highest specificity using PHI and MRI alone, in series, and in parallel
 to maximize the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer for biopsy-naïve Black and Hispanic
men;
 2A) Compare the costs of the biopsy strategies for the detection of Gleason ≥3+4 PCa at initial biopsy;
 2B) Estimate the cost-effectiveness of each strategy relative to biopsying all men as the cost per Gleason
 ≥3+4 PCa detected;
 3) Characterize the MRI-blind lesions in Blacks and Hispanics men undergoing radical prostatectomy."

Research. Oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OPC) cancers afflict more than 53,000 individuals in the United
States annually. Despite advancements in oncologic therapies, the majority of patients will experience significant
toxicity burden during and after therapy, including moderate-severe xerostomia, dysphagia, reduced mouth
opening (i.e. trismus), periodontal disease, and osteoradionecrosis. Remote electronic symptom monitoring
through standardized assessment tools for patient reported outcomes (ePROs) is an evidence-based best
practice, particularly in the COVID-19 era, yet few clinical practices have demonstrated sustainability of
implementation efforts. To date, acute and chronic orodental complications afflicting OC/OPC survivors are
largely managed on empirical knowledge with wide inter-provider management variability based on provider
experience and available clinical information which is often incomplete, incorrect, or nonexistent. Therefore,
standardization of electronic data capture of PROs and objective measures of provider-assessed orodental
toxicity severity remains an unmet public health need. Our central hypothesis is that synchronous optimization
of machine-readable patient- and provider-generated data collection can be achieved through prioritization of
effective implementation strategies for longitudinal oro-systemic ePRO data collection (Aim 1) and creation of
novel dental standards for accurate orodental toxicity reporting in both electronic health and dental records (Aim
2). As a subcomponent to Aim 2, we will also design and pilot a novel radiation odontogram to enhance treatment
communication between providers. Accurate risk predictions of high-morbidity high-prevalence post-therapy
orodental sequelae using high-quality electronic data from Aims 1 and 2 will be incorporated into a statistically
robust machine-learning based model (Aim 3). In summary, the PROHEALER proposal fosters innovative and
novel informatics approaches for data-driven risk assessment and algorithmic prevention and management of
treatment-related oral health diseases afflicting OC/OPC survivors.
Career Development & Training. Dr. Moreno's overarching goal is to become an internationally recognized
independent research investigator with domain expertise in advanced radiation therapy techniques, clinical
informatics and rigorous toxicity modeling methodologies as they pertain to improving patient quality of life and
promoting precision prevention and risk-based interventions for orodental complications. This proposal presents
Dr. Moreno's 5-year mentored career development plan which includes mentorship from prominent Established
NIH Investigators who have committed to overseeing the progress of the proposed projects and Dr. Moreno's
overall professional development. The outlined training activities build upon Dr. Moreno's clinical expertise as a
Head and Neck Cancer Radiation Oncologist and her prior work in EHR utility enhancement with the inclusion
of a comprehensive didactic and project-based curriculum focused on domain knowledge expansion in dental
informatics, implementation science, and advanced statistical methods in risk prediction modeling."
10916264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 CMV disease is the largest cause of post-transplant patient mortality. After a transplant, patients have to
undergo extensive screening and prophylactic therapy in order to prevent reactivation of the virus. In many
cases, even if these precautions are taken, the virus will reactivate after the patients finish antiviral therapy. This
is due to the virus establishing latency in cells of the myeloid lineage. Because the antivirals target and inhibit
virus replication, CMV is very difficult to target in its latent stage due to low levels of replication. This proposal
aims to develop molecular tools that have the potential to be used in clinic to prevent CMV-related mortality, by
combining the fields of protein and DNA engineering.
 In the first aim, a CMV detection platform will be developed that combines the techniques of rolling circle
amplification and hybridization chain reaction to then turn on a luminescent protein biosensor that can be
detected with a cell phone camera. This tool will allow identification of active CMV infection with high sensitivity
by performing the one-pot reaction at room temperature with no special equipment for detection other than a cell
phone. Patients will be able to self-screen at home using this low-cost alternative to PCR that does not require
trained personnel or expensive equipment.
 In the second aim, DNA self-assembly technique of toehold-dependent strand displacement will be
utilized to trigger a toxic protein switch in response to CMV-specific RNA input. The components will be
introduced into a population of cells that may be latently infected with CMV, and the switch will turn on in response
to a latency-associated CMV RNA that is expressed in target cells. This will cause specific death of CMV-infected
cells. The potential application of this switch is its use in bone marrow transplants—the switch may be introduced
in the cells of donor bone marrow, and any infected cells can be killed before transplantation into the recipient.
 Development of DNA/RNA-activated protein switches have been limited to natural cas proteins so far.
There is a strong desire for the discovery of more cas proteins to extend the toolbox of CRISPR. The techniques
developed in this proposal will circumvents that need by “CRISPR-izing” proteins of choice to perform any desired
function based on a nucleic acid input. In aim 1 of this proposal, an RNA-activated luminescent protein switch
will be constructed, and in aim 2, an RNA-activated toxic protein. These findings will give rise to a new class of
proteins to perform functions unattainable by cas proteins in nature."
10916561,"The American Academy of Periodontology and European Federation of Periodontology have recently adopted
the new terminology, “Grade C Periodontitis,” to identify individuals with a high risk for disease progression. The
localized form of this disease, now termed Stage 3-4 Grade C, molar-incisor pattern periodontitis (C/MIP),
exhibits a very well-defined clinical presentation. Although less common than other periodontitis, C/MIP has a
significant public health impact, as it affects systemically healthy, young individuals, of low social economic
status, who usually cannot afford its expensive and complex treatment, as their affected teeth are often lost due
to its rapid progression and delayed diagnosis. This leads to early function and aesthetics issues and life-long
difficulties for functional and aesthetic rehabilitation. Due its common aggregation in families, several studies
have searched for genetic associations with grade C disease, but not in large cohorts of C/MIP. Thus, genetic
contributions for C/MIP are not yet identified. The team put together for this proposal have conducted ground-
breaking work in this field over the last 3 decades, including the identification of candidate genetic susceptibility
variants, hyper-inflammatory response, and strong association with Aa and Aa JP2 clone. However, different
populations have different genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, and microbial colonization, which
further complicates unveiling the true etiology and pathogenesis of this disease. Thus, there is a critical need to
examine a large well-defined cohort of C/MIP families from different world regions to systematically and
comprehensively determine the genetic, host response, and microbial determinants of this disease. The goal of
this proposal is to characterize the genetic, host, and microbial factors of the early onset, well-defined, localized
form of periodontitis in populations worldwide. We propose to do this by gathering large cohort of C/MIP families
in 4 different continents to 1)identify genetic susceptibility variants within C/MIP families via WES; 2)Identify the
inflammatory networks associated with C/MIP 2, via transcriptome and network analysis and inflammatory
mediator profile in the oral environment of these affected families; and 3) Determine common microbiome profiles
via metagenomic analysis and unique Aa strains in C/MIP families from different regions of the world associated
with this disease. Our hypotheses are that 1-C/MIP will be associated with identifiable genetic variants, which
may vary in different regions of the globe, 2-a specific transcriptome is linked to pro-inflammatory pathways in
C/MIP, and 3-genotypically and phenotypically different strains of Aa will differ among regions of the globe and
will correlate with microbiome communities of distinct functionality and virulence potential.
 The impact of the proposed work is the development of an integrative series of interaction network and
functional analyses, which will lead to the characterization of susceptibility, molecular, and microbial phenotypes
of C/MIP in different populations around the world, which will provide criteria for early disease diagnosis and
development of targeted and individualized therapies for these highly susceptible families."

10917142,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration
of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. At present, PD is incurable. A roadblock halting development of
effective therapy for PD is the limited understanding of PD pathogenesis. While most PD cases are sporadic
without an ascertained cause, about 10% of PD cases are likely caused by mutation of a known or unknown
gene. Genetic clues not only help define the molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration but also help
identify biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic effectiveness. Compared to the other
neurodegenerative diseases, genetic discovery for PD is significantly deferred. One reason for deferred genetic
discovery in PD is the incomplete penetrance of disease phenotypes in PD and it is particularly true for late-onset PD. A compelling need for PD research is identifying and validating the genes segregating with late-onset
PD. Recently the new gene TMEM230 was reported to cosegregate with disease in a large family affected by
late-onset PD. Once after a novel disease gene is identified, enormous efforts are required to validate the
authenticity of the pathogenic role of the mutant gene in the disease. First, genetic variants cosegregating with
the disease must be verified in independent families afflicted with the disease. Second, disease phenotypes
observed in patients carrying the genetic variant must be reproduced in animal models expressing the disease-associated mutation. Third, mechanistic studies must be fulfilled to reveal how the disease-linked mutation
impairs cellular functions and thus to determine how these new mechanisms are integrated into existing
pathways leading to cell death in the disease. Validating process often takes many years to consolidate the
authenticity of a genetic mutation after a disease gene is identified. In the proposed studies, we will take
comprehensive approaches to validating the pathogenic role of TMEM230 mutation in late-onset PD by using
both cell culture and animal models. Upon completion, our study will determine the effect of TMEM230 mutation
on neuronal functions at both systemic and molecular levels."

Biomedical Informatics is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study that requires researchers to have a
knowledge base in numerous domains, including: biology, medicine, public health, ontology, human factors,
and data science. This multidisciplinary nature presents as a barrier to precocious students who may have an
interest in Biomedical Informatics but lack the prerequisite foundational skills and knowledge. We aim to
reduce that barrier to entry with our proposed research education program by equipping undergraduate and
master’s students with the skills to enable them to begin their career via graduate education or workforce
employment. At the same time, we need a special focus on increasing excellence through diversity. The
percentage of URMs is low when compared with other disciplines and this needs to be corrected if we are to
reach our excellence goals.
We propose a 12-week Buffalo Research Innovation in Genomic and Healthcare Technology (BRIGHT)

and train diverse undergraduate and masters’ students to prepare them for future careers in
Biomedical Informatics and Data Science. We will accomplish this objective through the following aims:
Aim 1: Expand trainee’s knowledge base in Biomedical Informatics and Data Science via didactic
teaching, including lectures and interactive notebooks.
Aim 2: Provide trainees with hands-on research in Biomedical Informatics to develop useful

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of degenerative joint disease affecting millions of people
worldwide and lead to a tremendous financial burden. Currently there are no disease modifying therapies
available for OA, due to limited understanding of the genetic factors and pathways underling OA progression.
Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of signaling pathways driving the pathogenesis of OA will motivate
innovation for early diagnosis and disease modifying therapeutics. This proposal will further the molecular
characterization of a genetic mutant mouse of the Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G6 (Adgrg6) gene.
ADGRG6 is enriched in articular cartilage in human and mouse, and we have demonstrated its involvement in
human OA. Loss of Adgrg6 in the articular cartilage in mouse leads to OA-like joint pathology, and
dysregulation of both cAMP and STAT3 signaling pathway. Interestingly, cAMP signaling is previously
indicated to drive chondroprotective mechanisms, and STAT3 activation is associated with OA development in
human. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that homeostasis of articular cartilage requires precise
regulation of both cAMP and STAT3 signaling. This hypothesis will be tested under three specific aims:
1. We will specifically activate cAMP signaling in articular cartilage using a novel Gs-coupled DREADD
 mouse, and determine the transcriptional network regulated by cAMP signaling. We will determine the
 cellular effectors of cAMP signaling during OA development in Adgrg6 mutant mice and in post-traumatic
 mouse model of OA.
2. We will determine the downstream effectors of STAT3-mediated signaling during OA progression using the
 post-traumatic mouse model of OA by analysis of STAT3 dependent gene regulation.
3. We will determine the efficacy of targeting STAT3 and cAMP signaling pathways for treatment of OA-like
 joint pathology using the post-traumatic mouse model of OA. We will utilize innovative pharmaceutical
 approaches for localized, slow-release delivery of disease modifying therapies targeting these pathways.
Taken together, this proposed study will utilize mouse genetics, combined with modern genomics and
pharmaceutic approaches to define the role of cAMP and STAT3 signaling in articular cartilage homeostasis
and OA pathogenesis, which may accelerate our diagnosis and treatment of human OA."

Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a research domain that addresses exposures to microbial
pathogens and infectious disease processes in order to characterize human health effects. It has become a
well-established framework for predictive and retrospective evaluations of health risks. QMRA is a translational
science requiring integration of knowledge from mathematics, statistics, biology, engineering, and public
health. Though complex, QMRA is highly useful for addressing societal problems encountered within the
multidisciplinary biomedical community - public health, emergency response, environmental control measures,
decontamination, industrial hygiene and medical countermeasures. Exposure to microbial agents of disease
and subsequent development of infection are dynamic processes associated with substantial variability and
uncertainty across the population, which must also be communicated in order to effectively manage risk. Since
risk science is inherently interdisciplinary, few programs in the contributing disciplines offer courses and
training in QMRA. Though training, models and tools have increased as the result of our preliminary work,
barriers to full participation across the biomedical community still exists especially needs in mentoring and
outreach. Our long term goals are to increase the capability for biomedical and behavioral scientists: (i) to
incorporate and contribute to microbial risk assessments related to their research; and (ii) to increase their
ability to lead and contribute to diverse, interdisciplinary team science projects related to microbial risks. The
objective of this project is to provide the biomedical community with comprehensive training in microbial risk
sciences, evidence-based mentoring approaches to support inclusion and participation of scientists from
diverse backgrounds and a data/computational platform to facilitate deeper learning and the QMRA practice.
The proposed project builds upon several, successful, ten-day courses offered through the NIH funded
QMRAIII program (2014 to 2018) and previous one week-long, intensive courses conducted through the
Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Assessment) from 2006 to 2011. Each year, there were significantly more
applicants than allowable enrollment; and mid-career and senior faculty members were generally excluded to
prioritize early career researchers. Our evaluations and assessments support our model of practice for
reaching learning objectives. However, the balance of contributions across the biomedical community would be
greatly enhanced through sustained mentoring and outreach opportunities which are complementary to the
course as well as an online platform for future trainees and educators."

Over 38 million people across the world live with HIV. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has suppressed HIV
plasma viremia, the persistent inflammation in people living with HIV (PLWH) places them at two-fold greater
risk of developing metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is biochemically associated
with predictive inflammatory metabolic biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), saturated fatty acids
(SAFAs), and ceramides. In numerous HIV clinical cohort studies, the excess CVD risk has been documented.
Systemic inflammation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of CVD. However, traditional CVD risk
assessments do not include direct cardiometabolic measurements of inflammation, nor are unique aspects of
inflammatory processes in PLWH considered. While the biochemical factors leading to inflammation and CVD
are multifactorial, antiretrovirals (ARVs) are a unique factor. ARV exposure induces changes in the functional
cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles and increases inflammatory cytokines; these changes promote
CVD in PLWH. Therefore, the net influence on the cardiometabolic risk must be clarified to provide more targeted
CVD risk factor modification among PLWH. To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct the Multiomics and
Antiretroviral Drug Exposure for assessing Metabolic Effects (MADE-FOR-ME) study using stored specimens
from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Women Interagency HIV Study Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) to
quantify ARV exposure and CVD inflammatory biomarkers. With these specimens, we will quantify ARV
exposure and perform experimental multiomics analyses to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying
the development of CVD. We will apply principal component analyses, Bayesian estimation methods, and
mediation analyses to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of CVD, particularly
among different demographic groups living with HIV. We will make exposure-response relationships among
different populations such that we can stratify the risk and have population-specific biomarkers and/or
understand the limitations from more established biomarkers of interest. These are uniquely 21st century
clinical problems that require 21st century methodologies. Our project will likewise contribute to the fields
of drug development, computational biology, and systems physiology. By expanding into these areas,
we will synergistically impact and transform research studying HIV-associated comorbidities. We anticipate
discovering unique and potential drug targets and biomarkers to utilize for more precise monitoring of HIV-
associated CVD. With this committed multidisciplinary team, we will identify the effects of ARV exposure on
metabolic homeostasis and on inflammatory profiles and pioneer a new era of personalized medicine in
HIV/AIDS research with antiretroviral pharmacometabolomics."
10917316,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use poses significant health problems particularly when characterized by bouts of heavy consumption
(i.e., binges). It is now recognized that women demonstrate greater vulnerability to the adverse effects of
alcohol, including greater physiological risk of organ damage (e.g., liver cirrhosis), than do men with
comparable histories of alcohol use. Research suggests that ovarian hormones play a role in substance abuse.
With regard to alcohol use, there is evidence to suggest that women may exhibit distinct patterns of heavy
drinking across the menstrual cycle. Indeed, our preliminary research shows that surges in follicular estradiol
[E2] at ovulation predict increased alcohol use in young women. Yet, to date no research has aimed to
determine the specific behavioral mechanisms by which rapid surges in E2 confer increased abuse potential of
alcohol. The proposed study directly examines ovarian hormone flux and acute sensitivity to alcohol to provide
the first rigorous and integrative test of the hypothesis that rapid rises in estradiol increase the acute rewarding
and disinhibiting effects of alcohol and that this heightened sensitivity increases alcohol use outside the
laboratory. A sample of 100 naturally-cycling women will be examined daily over their menstrual cycle using an
integrative combination of daily ecological assessments of hormone fluctuations and alcohol use along with
strategically-timed laboratory tests of their acute sensitivity to the rewarding and disinhibiting effects of a
controlled dose of alcohol. The findings will advance understanding of the neurobehavioral mechanisms
linking E2 to alcohol abuse and inform clinical assessment practice by highlighting the importance of menstrual
cycle phase and hormonal profiles when assessing alcohol abuse risk in young women."

The objective of this training program is to provide post-doctoral fellows with didactic and research experience
in cellular and molecular aspects of cancer to prepare them for independent investigative careers in basic and
translational cancer research. The program forms the core of cancer biology training in the Helen Diller Family
Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDCCC) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The faculty,
who are all members of the HDCCC, consists of basic researchers, laboratory-based physician-scientists, and
more applied clinician-investigators who share common interests in the multifaceted fields of cellular, molecular
and structural biology applied to the understanding of mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression, diagnosis
and therapy. The areas of didactic and research training will expose trainees to a spectrum of approaches,
concepts and opportunities from altered gene and protein structure and expression, cancer microenvironment
and immunity, cell cycling and signaling to differentiation and development. The goal of this approach is to
further the understanding of cancer incidence and progression so that the trainees will have an appropriate
perspective to approaching basic cancer research as well as to address, prevention, biomarkers and
translation to patients. Post-doctoral trainees will join one of 37 research groups involved in studying these
basic mechanisms. To broaden their experience, the trainees will have secondary mentors and will be
encouraged to seek out collaborations with other research groups at UCSF or outside. Because of the
significance and need for training in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology for modern cancer research, we
have initiated a workshop for our trainees, taught by the Program faculty. Trainees will have access to all the
academic resources available at UCSF. In this way, trainees will be provided with an in-depth research
experience in an environment that covers the broad forefront of molecular and cellular dysregulation in cancer.
Seminar programs, research-in-progress discussions and journal clubs complement the research training.
Trainees must have a Ph.D. or equivalent degree in cell or molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry or an
applicable discipline, or an M.D. or M.D., Ph.D. The trainees will be selected on the basis of past
accomplishments and promise, course work, grades achieved, suitability for the research projects and a
commitment to a research career. Trainees will receive a stipend for an average of 2 years, but will be part of
the program throughout their training period of at least 3 years. The program will consist of 8 trainees,
complemented by the larger group of other trainees in the host laboratories to make a significant critical mass
of basic cancer researchers in the CCC. Upon completion of the program, it is anticipated that the trainees will
continue careers in basic and translational cancer research in academic institutions, governmental agencies or
the biotechnology industry."

Short-term memory function is commonly supported through persistent activity, the sustained
response of populations of neurons following the offset of a memorized stimulus. This form of
activity underlies diverse tasks including navigation, motor control, and decision-making. Classic
mechanistic theories have idealized such activity through models that assume strongly
homogeneous populations of neurons that encode only a single variable and generate perfectly
stable patterns of activity. This contrasts with recent work showing that neurons in real biological
memory networks exhibit multiplexed encoding of multiple stimulus attributes, temporally varying
responses across the population, and context dependence. Here we address the circuit
mechanisms and role of this diversity in function through a combined experimental-theoretical
approach. Experiments are conducted in a short-term memory circuit of the larval zebrafish gaze
control system that contributes to stable vision by precisely maintaining the eyes on a visual
target. Taking advantage of the quantitative precision and experimental tractability of this system,
we combine whole-circuit, synapse-resolution anatomy with circuit-wide recordings and
perturbations of activity at cellular resolution. In Aim 1, we combine these data into a model of the
system in which neurons map in a one-to-one manner with experimentally recorded neurons. This
enables us to infer the interactions within and between neurons of different anatomical, genotypic,
and functional cell classes and form predictions for how these interactions govern circuit function.
In Aim 2, we use 3D cellular resolution optical imaging and stimulating perturbations of neuronal
activity to refine our model and test model predictions. In Aim 3, we expand our capacity to form
precise characterizations of within and between cell-class interactions by developing and applying
3D suppression of neurons across the memory circuit. Altogether, this work promises to greatly
expand our understanding of the circuit mechanisms and role of cell type diversity in persistent
firing, short-term memory, and motor control."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and over ten million
people worldwide are living with PD. To date, treatments are only symptomatic; they do not alter the inexorable
progression of the disease. The most common cause of familial and idiopathic PD are mutations in leucine-rich
repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD demonstrate mitochondrial impairment, however
our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD is limited. In our efforts to
understand the underlying mechanisms driving mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that mitochondrial DNA
damage is a shared phenotype amongst both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. Unrepaired mitochondrial
DNA damage can have major adverse cellular effects, impacting genetic and protein instability, compromising
bioenergetic function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and triggering cell death. Recent preliminary studies
by the Sanders lab has found that blocking kinase activity of ATM (a kinase that functions to sense, signal and
promote repair of DNA damage) rescues PD-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. We further observed that
ATM is activated and initiates the DNA damage response pathway. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA repair
capacity is impaired with a concomitant increase in specific mitochondrial oxidative DNA lesions. Our central
hypothesis is that dysfunctional LRRK2 triggers the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway, which
impairs mitochondrial DNA repair capacity, leading to an increase in mitochondrial DNA damage, ultimately
promoting downstream pathogenic PD cascades. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims that
integrate molecular, biochemical and cellular techniques using established neuronal and murine PD models. Aim
1 will determine the molecular nature of the mitochondrial DNA damage and the dependency on LRRK2 kinase
activity. Aim 2 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial DNA damage accumulates in PD.
Aim 3 will determine the contribution of ATM to PD-associated phenotypes. This project will advance our
understanding of LRRK2 function in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Further, preclinical testing may
establish ATM as a viable therapeutic target and lay the foundation for the development of neuroprotective PD
therapeutic strategies."

10917323,"In this proposed project, we plan to fill the knowledge gap of the relationships between
microscopic self-assembled structures, collagen-molecule interactions and macroscopic fiber
morphologies of type-I collagen, the primary component of most human tissues and a commonly
used biomaterial for tissue engineering. By investigating collagen-water and collagen-protein
interactions in in vitro systems that mimic basic aspects of physiologically relevant three-
dimensional fibrillar tissue architectures, we aim to fill knowledge gaps in fundamental collagen
research. We will achieve this goal by developing a hyperspectral imaging technique – vibrational
sum frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy – at high repetition rates (400 kHz) and apply it to
collagen. The long-term vision is to develop new biophysics methods to reveal molecular-level
structures and interactions for pericellular space research and other complex biological
environments, and eventually applying it to study various pericellular environment related
diseases. In order to correlate spectral features to microscopic and macroscopic structures of
type I collagen, we plan to apply machine-learning techniques to analyze our data and extract
spectral signatures of collagen’s micro/macrostructures. We will two major scientific focuses: (A)
understanding molecular signatures of microscopic self-assembly fibrils structures and its
relationship to the macroscopic morphology (plan 1 and 2); and (B) investigating molecular level
collagen-molecule interactions (plan 3 and 4). Specific plans include:
 1. Obtaining hyperspectral VSFG images of collagen tissues to study their morphology in a
 label free and non-invasive manner
 2. Establishing molecular spectral signatures of self-assembled collagen fibril structures
 3. Understanding collagen-water interaction in first solvation layer of collagen fibers.
 4. Imaging spatial locations of chemicals and peptides that interact with collagens.
If successful, the significance is that a label free, vibrational mode specific imaging technique
specific for pericellular space will be available, which can reveal molecular level insights of
collagen structures and its interactions with surrounding molecules, pertinent to fibrosis and cell—
pericellular space interaction related diseases. This proposed project contributes to the scope of
NIGMS by developing new technology to reveal fundamental molecular-level principle,
mechanism and signatures related to morphology of collagen I at both micro- and macroscopic
scales, and collagen-molecule interactions, laying foundations for biophysical/biochemical
principles for future biomedical applications related to collagens."
10918162,"Control of physiological systems via the autonomic nervous system is often based on a baseline of tonic
neural activity that is modulated to achieve a desired state. Electrical stimulation can be used to increase, or
upregulate, this activity, but until recently, there was no reliable means to rapidly and reversibly decrease, or
downregulate, this activity. The ability to downregulate, or completely block, neural activity could apply to a wide
range of clinical applications and new treatments, including: downregulation of sympathetic drive to the heart for
arrhythmias, block of bronchopulmonary parasympathetic nerves to reverse the bronchospasm in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), block of nociceptive fibers to alleviate chronic neuropathic pain, and
block of spastic urinary sphincter muscles to enable voiding, etc. Kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC)
has been demonstrated as a way to provide nerve block in a quick acting, titratable, and rapidly reversible
manner. The goal of the NECTAR project is to create the tools necessary to allow researchers to incorporate
reversible electrical nerve block via KHFAC into their research in a practical, effective, and safe manner.
 KHFAC nerve block has two key features that distinguish it from non-electrical nerve block. First, KHFAC
nerve block occurs instantly. Second, KHFAC nerve block is fully and rapidly reversible. Unfortunately, research
in the area of nerve block has been hampered by a lack of commercially available nerve block devices.
Successful application of KHFAC block requires knowledge of the specific waveform parameters for effective
and safe use of these waveforms in neural control. The therapeutic effect of KHFAC is complex and multimodal
resulting in suboptimal results from improperly tuned waveform parameters. The contribution of the NECTAR
project will be to provide two critical deliverables related to KHFAC block: 1) a fully featured device with
reproducible outputs and 2) comprehensive mapping of the KHFAC parameter space.
 In aim one, a KHFAC module will be produced that will include many key features such as amplitude/
frequency ramping, validated outputs, DC offset mitigation, and charge injection capacity (CIC) electrode testing.
In aim two, we will perform chronic in vivo studies to provide data that establishes the therapeutic window for
KHFAC block with respect to frequency, amplitude, charge delivery, and duty cycle. These studies will involve
both functional and histological metrics for safety and efficacy.
 Electrical block, when combined with electrical stimulation, can provide real-time control of neural activity, in
which action potentials can be variably upregulated or downregulated as needed; a significant advantage for
many bioelectronic applications. With the completion of Aims 1 and 2, the NECTAR project will enable the
bioelectronic research community to rapidly proceed with incorporation of KHFAC electrical nerve block into their
research studies."

10918177,"RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE – ABSTRACT
The overall objective of the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) Research Education
Core (REC) is to increase the number of students from underrepresented populations engaged in cancer
research by fostering meaningful research, education, and community engaged experiences which link faculty
and students of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert
H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC). For this Core, we define students
as high school through postdoctoral fellows. Between 2016 – 2019, the REC launched research education
experiences bringing together diverse students across the Chicagoland area, developed curricula introducing
students to the science of cancer disparities, and built robust networks with high school and local community
college students to encourage their entry into REC programs. In that period, the REC provided structured
summer research education experiences through the ChicagoCHEC Research Fellows (CHEC Fellows)
Program to 65 students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds. The CHEC Fellows Program is an
intensive 8-week summer program that introduces students to a breadth of cancer health disparities research
topics and to the work of leading cancer researchers, provides hands-on engagement with community partners,
and builds professional skills as a foundation for lifelong learning. In this renewal, we seek to sustain the
successes of the CHEC Fellows Program and add programming to further student entry into cancer research
trajectories and further meet the needs of students within ChicagoCHEC sponsored Projects. Thus, the CHEC
Fellows Program will be complemented by development of new career readiness and career development
supports, and an expansion of ChicagoCHEC Laboratory Experiences and Programs (LEaP), which matches
students, including graduates of the CHEC Fellows Program, to intensive, one-on-one mentored immersion
experiences in cancer research laboratories. A diverse and exceptional tri-institutional team of cancer research
faculty has been assembled to lead the REC in achieving its specific aims, which are to: (1) develop curriculum
and support professional development opportunities to increase Chicago area undergraduate interest and
readiness in entering the cancer research career pipeline; (2) refine and sustain the CHEC Fellows and LEaP
Programs for diverse undergraduate students recruited from NEIU, UIC, NU, and City Colleges of Chicago; (3)
link underrepresented students (undergraduates, graduate/medical students and postdoctoral fellows) to
mentored cancer research experiences within ChicagoCHEC Projects and provide career development support;
and (4) implement continuous tracking and program evaluation. Initiatives of the ChicagoCHEC REC will directly
introduce students to cancer research and enhance their capacity to seek out opportunities that will enable them
to pursue meaningful, highly effective careers in this field."
10917771,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The composition and organization of the cell surface are critically important for cell-to-cell communication and
for the ability of cells to interact with their surrounding environment. The cell surface is decorated with myriad
glycosylated transmembrane proteins for which there is a molecular understanding of their function and cell
surface presentation. Surprisingly, RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are also glycosylated and
components of the cell surface. However, is unknown what glycosylated RNAs and RBPs do at the cell surface.
This unexplored area of biology represents a major knowledge gap in our understanding of both the RNA and
cell surface fields. Thus, the immediate goal of this proposal is to close this knowledge gap and to create the
conceptual and technical foundations that will enhance our understanding and exploration, respectively, of the
biology of RNA at the surface of the cell. To achieve this, we propose to explore three fundamental, but
outstanding, hypotheses. Importantly, these hypotheses are established on sound logic of the known biology of
RNA and RBPs and supported by the published literature and preliminary data. Hypothesis 1 explores the
molecular, biochemical, and biophysical activities of the cell surface localized RBPs DDX21 and NCL in the
extracellular space. Hypothesis 2 takes an unbiased genetic approach to determine how cell surface RBPs are
trafficked to the cell surface, given that they lack a classical membrane-targeting signal. Hypothesis 3 explores
the intersection between cell surface RBPs and RNA in disease pathogenesis by focusing on the functional
characterization of cell surface RBPs that possess cell-penetrating activities. The expected outcomes of this
research are to reveal that the biochemical activities of RBPs are not restricted to the intracellular space of the
cell, but also to the cell surface. The significance of the proposed research lies in expanding the field of RNA to
the surface of cells and providing proof of concept of the importance of cell surface RBPs in human disease.
While high-risk, the proposed research addresses an important problem and has the potential to be
transformative. Hence its suitability for the Transformative Research Award."
10917838,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of the proposed project is to develop an innovative chair built with a calibrated pressure-shifting
programmable surface to prevent and/or treat pressure injuries in persons living with Alzheimer's disease or a related
dementia (ADRD). Persons living with moderate to severe ADRD, either in long-term care facilities or private homes,
are at increased risk for the development of pressure injuries. Physical repositioning is the cornerstone of pressure
injury prevention; however, there are barriers that limit its use among persons with ADRD. While active devices to
spread or shift supportive pressure have been shown to have advantage over passive devices, the existing devices
on the market have limited use due to cost, safety, patient discomfort, noise, and energy use. The proposed system
would overcome these concerns and be suitable for widespread use in both homes and long-term care facilities for
persons with ADRD. Testing in phase I will include both testing of the effectiveness of the chair in shifting pressure
as well as acceptability and usability testing. The project team is uniquely suited to successfully carry out this
research due to our unique combination of skills and abilities, which includes a history of developing product for
injury prevention, age-related injury research, and research involving pressure injuries in dementia care, as well as
experience in the conduct and analysis of qualitative research and multi-methods research."
10930924,"Liquid Biopsy for Rapid Detection and Real Time Monitoring of FGFR-altered Cancers
Patients with advanced cancers driven by fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) alterations, including gene
fusions and single nucleotide variants (SNVs), are benefiting from several new FGFR kinase inhibitors.
Erdafitinib and pemigatinib were recently FDA approved for bladder cancer and cholangiocarcinoma,
respectively, and other FGFR inhibitors have received fast-track designation and are being explored in tumor
agnostic basket trials. Patients are experiencing improved overall survival and progression free survival, with
high overall response rates. Unfortunately, virtually all patients eventually develop resistance to these inhibitors,
oftentimes through acquisition of secondary FGFR mutations. FGFR inhibitor development is hindered by the
lack of accurate and comprehensive methods to 1) rapidly detect FGFR alterations in order to qualify patients
for clinical trials, 2) monitor therapeutic response, and 3) characterize emerging drug resistance. The
development of novel testing strategies, such as non-invasive liquid biopsies, can fulfill these unmet needs for
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection. Liquid biopsies evaluate a blood sample, from which cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) shed by the tumor is sequenced to detect genomic alterations. The technical specifications for existing
commercial cfDNA tests show that these assays are not validated for FGFR fusions and have insufficient
sensitivities of ~30% for FGFR fusions. Additionally, commercial tests are too large and costly to repeat
frequently for therapy and disease monitoring. Thus, we propose to develop and validate an FGFR-focused,
accurate, and cost-effective cfDNA sequencing assay (FGFR-Dx) for real-time testing to support rapid detection,
response monitoring, and early detection of resistance. Our team at Ohio State University has six active FGFR
inhibitor clinical trials, a large cohort of FGFR true positives, and a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
(CLIA)-compliant Cancer Genomics Lab with extensive experience performing clinical-grade tumor sequencing
and bioinformatics analysis for detection and interpretation of gene fusions and single nucleotide variants.
Further, we have paired this cfDNA development with a rapid research autopsy study that will enable the first
systematic evaluation of detection limits for cfDNA by assessing how accurately the heterogeneity observed
across tumor samples from multiple sites is represented in cfDNA. We propose the following Aims to address
the criteria for PAR-18-317: 1) Analytically validate a targeted liquid biopsy assay (FGFR-Dx) to detect fusions
and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in FGFR1-3; 2) Establish the clinical validity of FGFR-Dx to detect FGFR
fusions and SNVs. In summary, coupling the development of an FGFR-focused liquid biopsy with rapid research
autopsy can broadly impact the field’s understanding and application of cfDNA approaches in patients with
FGFR-altered and other cancers."
10917481,"Project Summary
Without significant additional political leadership, investment and further scientific advance, the global
response to HIV/AIDS is not on track to achieve the 2030 goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat.
This is due to continued high rates of incident HIV infection in multiple communities, populations,
countries, and regions. While HIV science has made remarkable advances, implementation of highly
effective prevention and treatment options remains challenging. Taken together, these realities
underscore that the HIV response must be global to succeed, that HIV research and training efforts
must also be global and multidisciplinary, and that actors in all sectors of the HIV response are needed
to address our shared goal of reducing HIV as a threat to global health and individual wellbeing. To
respond to this imperative, the 25th International AIDS Conference, AIDS 2024, will convene the HIV
community in Munich, Germany, and virtually in July 2024.
AIDS 2024 will bring together clinicians and people living with HIV, community leaders and policy
makers, basic scientists, junior investigators, donors, journalists, and experts from law, policy and
program implementation. This diversity is essential to revitalizing the HIV response, since multi-sectoral
and multi-disciplinary work is needed. Munich was also selected as host city to bring a specific focus
on Central and Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and the Russian Federation, where the HIV epidemic
continues to expand, driven by a lack of access to health services for key populations and exacerbated
by the disruption and instability of the war in Ukraine, mass migration and faltering economies.
AIDS 2024 aims to:
1. Accelerate scientific discovery to drive innovation across the HIV prevention and treatment
cascades, including pathogenesis, transmission, co-morbidities, vaccines, and cure; long-acting oral
and injectable treatment and prevention technologies, including rings for prevention; integrated and
differentiated models of care; and analyses of structural and economic determinants of health.
2. Advance core components of implementation science research that address the challenges
and opportunities of implementing novel prevention and treatment modalities in different populations
and contexts, including implementation of long-acting antiretrovirals for prevention and treatment, and
in settings of conflict and displacement.
3. Address HIV vulnerability and determinants of disease progression among key and
vulnerable populations, including novel interventions and implementation science to reduce stigma
and discrimination, including intersectional stigmas of HIV, homophobia, transphobia, and ethnic and
racial disparities.
4. Draw attention to enduring gaps in the HIV response, such as areas where greater investment
is needed in research and person-centered service delivery, and where the needs of communities
remain neglected.
5. Explore complex dynamics of the still expanding HIV epidemic in Central and Eastern
Europe, including structural barriers preventing uptake of services by key and vulnerable populations
and the impact of the war in Ukraine.
The scientific program will consist of six tracks: Track A/Basic and translational research; Track
B/Clinical research; Track C/Epidemiology and prevention research; Track D/Social and behavioral
research; Track E/Implementation research, economics, systems and synergies; and Track F/Political
research, law, policy and human rights. Main topics, challenges and developments to be addressed in
each track are described below. While the scientific program of the conference is developed by
international members of track committees representative of different disciplines and areas of science,
cross-cutting aspects will be covered in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with
community and policy perspectives. Additionally, bridging sessions are designed to cut across at least
two of the scientific tracks to provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary, multi-perspective dialogues. A
particular emphasis will be placed on ensuring interaction between on-site and virtual conference
delegates in Q&A and discussion sessions through the use of advanced conferencing technology.
Access and diversity will remain key guiding principles at AIDS 2024, with large scholarship and youth
programs to strengthen engagement and capacities of the next generation of researchers, clinicians,
educators, and advocates. The conference will be fully hybrid with all conference sessions accessible
online live and on demand."

resulting from the Committee’s review of work presented at our research meetings, including the Prostate
Cancer Working Group (weekly), SPORE Scientific Seminar Series (monthly), Genitourinary Disease
Management Team (monthly), Multi-institutional Prostate Cancer Program Retreat (annual), and the MSK
Geoffrey Beene Cancer Research Center Retreats (annual). This ensures the steady infusion of new ideas and
techniques into our SPORE in Prostate Cancer program. Preference will be given to projects that complement
the long-term research goals of the SPORE and advance our translational research objectives. The Executive
Committee can also solicit and fund experimental or clinical initiatives that address an urgent and specific need

10915682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The SPORE Career Enhancement Program (CEP) prepares physicians and scientists for independent careers
as investigators in translational research in prostate cancer. We have designed the CEP to form both an
interdepartmental and an interinstitutional training ground to produce investigators who will become intellectual
leaders in their fields of interest. By combining the research and academic resources available throughout
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and at our affiliated institutions, we have a long tradition of successful
faculty development. Recruiting and/or developing the career of junior faculty members committed to
translational research in prostate cancer is a centerpiece of our program. Over the next 5 years we will
continue to recruit and develop the careers of junior faculty members and experienced investigators—from
both basic research and clinical backgrounds—committed to translational research in prostate cancer."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle disorder that affects
approximately 1:3500 to 1:5200 live male births caused by mutations in the X-linked DMD
gene. DMD gene mutations result in absence of the dystrophin protein in muscle fibers,
leading to myofiber necrosis, endomysial fibrosis, and fat replacement. It is a devastating
disorder, leading to loss of ambulation by age 12, and historically to death by age 20. The
psychological and socioeconomic effects on families are enormous; these include but are
not limited to the costs of medical care, opportunity costs for career and work, and the
psychological toll taken on parents and siblings. Our long-term goal is to understand which
genes modify disease progression and severity of DMD. Confirming a hypothesis derived
from a genetic modifier of muscular dystrophies in mice, we have recently used data from
patients enrolled in the United Dystrophinopathy Project (UDP) to demonstrate that
polymorphisms in the LTBP4 gene influence age at loss of ambulation. Our objective in
this project is to identify additional genetic modifiers of skeletal muscle, cardiac, and
ventilatory function, and our central hypothesis is that such modifiers can be identified
by use of the UDP database, a unique resource that contains detailed phenotypic data
and archived DNA samples from over 900 DMD patients. Our specific aims are to 1)
update and analyze phenotypic data within the UDP cohort, 2) map modifier traits by high-
density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and 3) validate newly identified putative
genetic modifiers. Validation will engage collaborating networks of investigators in the US
and Europe, who have additional natural history cohorts of DMD patients. At the
conclusion of these Aims, we will have gained new information about modifier genes
associated with the severity and progression of DMD."

Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide that occurs due to the
detrimental effects of myocardial infarction (MI)/ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Mechanisms of MI/IRI
are not completely clear, and hence, there are no effective therapeutic strategies; current therapeutic
approaches to mitigate heart damage mostly focus on restoring coronary perfusion but not limiting
reperfusion injury. Multiple forms of cell death occur at different stages of post-MI/IRI depending on the
severity of the disease. This project will elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of a recently discovered iron-
dependent programmed cell death, ferroptosis, in cardiac IRI. Ferroptosis arises via excessive oxygenation
of phospholipids (PLs) accompanied by the insufficient capacity of a selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4) to eliminate oxidized PLs, particularly, phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) at the expense of
reduced glutathione (GSH). We have recently identified and quantified pro-ferroptotic PEox species in
response to RSL3 (GPX4 inhibitor, ferroptosis inducer) in cardiomyocytes by a state-of-art technique. In
addition, our preliminary studies revealed accumulation of ferroptotic PEox species in mitochondria
isolated from hearts exposed to global IRI as well as from cardiomyocytes challenged with RSL3. We
propose that mitochondria participate in MI/IRI-induced ferroptotic signaling through two major GSH-
dependent mechanisms: i) IR-induced mitochondrial ROS generation by ETC and TCA cycle deplete GSH,
and hence, inactivate the GSH/GPX4 system, and ii) glutamate deficiency due to inhibition of
glutaminolysis in mitochondria inhibits GSH synthesis as a result of low glutamate and cysteine levels.
Thus, this project will explore a novel paradigm by investigating the role of mitochondria in cardiac IRI
ferroptosis. Our central hypothesis is that mitochondria are engaged in ferroptosis induced by cardiac IRI
through diminishing GPX4 activity and inability to control the accumulation of pro-ferroptotic PEox species.
Also, we propose that major cell death mechanisms have different impacts during post-MI/IRI depending
on the severity and duration of post-MI/IRI. Hence, we will evaluate specific biomarkers to distinguish the
contributions of apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis to post-MI/IRI. Two approaches will be
employed to mitigate cardiac IRI via i) specific suppression of mtROS production/GSH depletion, and ii)
replenishment of the GSH pool by a potent reductant lipoic/dihydrolipoic acid (LA/DHLA). Specific Aims of
the project will (i) determine comparative contributions of ferroptosis to cardiac dysfunction during IRI, (ii)
explore molecular mechanisms of mitochondria-mediated ferroptotic signaling in cardiac cells, and (iii)
examine the effectiveness of novel inhibitors of ferroptosis against cardiac IRI. The project will establish
the contribution of ferroptosis, in comparison with other major cell death mechanisms, to MI/IRI-induced
cardiac dysfunction, and discover new mitochondria-mediated mechanisms of ferroptotic signaling that will
lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiac IRI."
10914906,"Molecular classification has transformed the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors and created promising
avenues for targeted therapies. However, the clinical impact of molecular classification for brain tumor patients
has been blunted by long turnaround times (days-weeks), as well as the complex infrastructure and workflow
required to access genetic and epigenetic data from clinical specimens.
A system for rapid (<2 minute) molecular diagnostic screening would redefine the surgical and non-surgical
treatment of diffuse gliomas. Rapid intraoperative molecular classification would identify the patients who
would benefit most from radical resection from those with chemo- and/or radio-sensitive tumors where a more
conservative surgical approach, relying more heavily on adjuvant treatment, might be best. Immediate
molecular classification would also facilitate the use of targeted therapeutics and transform the way clinical
trials in the glioma field are designed by enabling rapid identification of potential study subjects based on
molecular criteria during or shortly after biopsy.
Through our academic-industrial partnership with Invenio Imaging Inc, we developed, implemented and
validated an accurate bedside system for rapid morphologic diagnosis through label-free stimulated Raman
histologic (SRH) imaging paired with an artificial intelligence-based algorithm (Hollon et al. Nature Medicine
2020). Here, we intend to leverage and enhance our unique AI-based platform for intraoperative diagnosis to
predict the molecular alterations that define diffuse gliomas within minutes of biopsy in the
operating room without the need for a pathology lab or specialized analytic facility.
This proposal is expected to yield an autonomous diagnostic workflow for human brain tumor molecular
diagnostics. The work proposed here represents the development of a platform approach by which molecular
diagnosis is unlocked through SRH and artificial intelligence, thus creating a new standard of accessibility for
molecular diagnosis in human cancer."
10914916,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Standard treatment of prostate cancer with current agents fails due to development of therapy resistance and
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a terminal disease. CRPC differs from early-staged prostate
cancer in its increased reliance on glycolysis (the Warburg effect) as well as emergence of therapy resistance
due to the androgen receptor (AR) splice variant 7 (AR-V7), a truncated, constitutively active AR that mediates
oncogenic programs in a hormone-independent manner. However, mechanisms underlying altered metabolism
and AR-V7-incuded signaling in CRPC remain largely unclear. Our analyses of tumor versus paired normal
samples uncovered overexpression of YY1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, during progression of CRPC. By
genomic profiling (ChIP-seq and RNA-seq) in CRPC cells, we demonstrate that YY1 binds to and induces high
transcription of metabolic genes such as PFKP, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis. Loss-of-function and
rescue studies show a YY1-PFKP axis essential for sustaining glycolysis and malignant growth of CRPC in cell
models. Additionally, YY1 interacts with AR-V7 co-occupying a majority of AR-V7 targets, where combined
actions of AR-V7 and YY1 maintain oncogenic signaling. Mass spectrometry-based identification of YY1
interactome uncovered YY1’s partners including bromodomain proteins. Knockdown of YY1, or blockade of
bromodomain proteins, suppressed CRPC growth. We hypothesize that YY1 and AR-V7 act in concert to
sustain both tumor metabolism (glycolysis)-related and AR-V7-related gene-expression programs, thereby
producing more aggressive tumor phenotypes and therapy resistance in terminal CRPCs; we also hypothesize
that targeting YY1’s co-activators reverses oncogenic signaling, providing an attractive anti-CPRC therapeutic.
Dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying the YY1-mediated CRPC progression should provide critical
insights into new treatment strategies. Towards this goal, we will use additional models to further define the
YY1:AR-V7 co-targeted gene pathways in CRPC; validation of this finding with primary tumor samples will be
paradigm-shifting and change current views regarding how oncogenic signaling is wired in CRPC (Aim 1). We
will define YY1 as a new oncogenic factor in promoting CRPC formation and tumor cell metabolism with cell
and murine models (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine blockade of YY1-associated co-activator machinery as
new means for treatment of CRPC (Aim 3). Because certain glycolysis pathway enzymes and YY1 cofactors
are potentially druggable with inhibitors, completion of the proposed research should not only promote a new
mechanistic understanding of CRPC but will yield innovative therapeutics for treatment of affected patients."

The nature and function of ocular surface nerves play a critical role in maintaining ocular surface health while
preventing disease. Disruption of ocular surface sensory nerves can lead to blinding keratitis, graft rejection,
dry eye disease, and ocular surface pain. The advent of “-omics” studies have provided a platform to
understand how ocular surface nerves participate in the broader context of ocular health and disease. Here,
we outline a proposal that will create large datasets detailing the nature of ocular surface innervation. We will
take a systems-level approach towards analyzing our data using bioinformatics and machine learning
platforms, so that we can gain a practical understanding of the ocular surface environment during health and
disease. Specifically, this proposal will address how ocular surface nerves, epithelial cells, and immune cells
interact. We have recruited a multidisciplinary research team that consists experts in ophthalmology,
neuroimmunology, neurology, proteomics, systems immunology, and bioinformatics. With this team, we plan to
comprehensively analyze all three levels of research outlined in the RFA, which includes anatomical and
morphological characterization, defining cellular and molecular properties of neuronal and non-neuronal cell
types, and assessing functional properties of neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Because innervation patterns
and functionality changes with disease, we will use multiple ocular surface disease models (viral keratitis and
aqueous dry eye disease) to better understand how neurons, epithelial cells, and immune cells affect neuronal
functionality and subsequent disease. We will achieve our goal by pursuing four specific aims: 1) We will
perform single-cell (sc)-omics on neuonrs and non-neuronal cells of the cornea and ocular surface innervating
ganglia. These data will characterize neuronal identities and describe their functionality during disease.
Additionally, we will be able to molecularly characterize immune and epithelial cells that influence the
functionality of ocular surface afferents during disease. 2) We will use mass spectrometry to analyze the
proteomic signatures of the cornea during health and disease. An unbiased shotgun approaches and a
targeted approach focusing on neurotrophic factors will be used to identify proteins that influence ocular
surface nerve functionality. 3) We will use our imaging techniques and histocytometry to comprehensively
analyze the location and morphology of neuronal and non-neuronal cells within the cornea, so that we may be
able to make conclusions about how nerves, epithelial, and immune cells interact in close proximity at the
ocular surface. 4) We will use DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs) technology
to perturb neuronal sensitivity, so that we can assess how altering neuronal responsiveness to stimuli may
affect the ocular surface homeostasis and progress of disease. A systems-level analysis of our observations
using machine-learning and bioinformatics will lead to the prediction of novel interaction networks that can be
interrogated in future studies. All data will be deposited into a web portal that we will develop."

PAH is a fatal disease characterized by the progressive remodeling of the distal pulmonary vascular arteries,
resulting in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, which may lead to serious
complications, such as right heart failure, and ultimately death. Accumulating evidence indicates that endothelial
dysfunction is one of the first triggers in PAH that leads to uncontrolled proliferation of vascular cells, vascular
remodeling, and occlusion of the pulmonary blood vessels. One of the most common pathomechanisms in PAH
is the alteration of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein Type 2 Receptor (BMPR2) signaling in vascular cells. The
loss of BMPR2 function, induced by mutation or a loss of expression, is associated with a severe hemodynamic
profile and poor outcomes in PAH patients. Multiple studies point to the pulmonary endothelium as the cell type
that is most critically impacted by BMPR2 loss in PAH. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
regulation of BMPR2 expression and its associated PAH-like phenotype remain largely unknown. Our group has
recently shown that SIN3a plays a central role in the DNA and histone methylation of the BMPR2 promoter in
pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and the pathogenesis of PAH. However, the epigenetic and transcriptional
mechanisms by which SIN3a regulates the BMPR2 gene in PAEC remain to be elucidated.
proposal are to uncover the role of SIN3a in the pulmonary endothelial dysfunction
Our objectives in this
in PAH, identify the
downstream mechanisms underlying the regulation of BMPR2 expression in PAEC, and evaluate the therapeutic
effects of modified mRNA encoding SIN3a in animal models of PAH. Our preliminary data showed that SIN3a is
significantly downregulated in hPAEC isolated from PAH patients. In vitro, we observed that SIN3a silencing
downregulates BMPR2 expression and signaling while potentiating PAEC proliferation and migration.
Mechanistically, we discovered a novel molecular pathway by which SIN3a modulates BMPR2 levels in hPAECs.
Our data showed that SIN3a overexpression upregulates FOXK2 by repressing Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2
(EZH2)-mediated histone methylation in the FOXK2 promoter. Ultimately, SIN3a overexpression increases
FOXK2 binding to the BMPR2 promoter and upregulates BMPR2 levels in hPAECs. Based upon these findings,
we hypothesize that the loss of SIN3a impairs BMPR2 expression in PAEC, triggers endothelial
dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PAH. In this proposal, our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the
following three specific aims: Aim 1) To investigate the role of SIN3a in endothelial cell dysfunction and decipher
the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of BMPR2 in PAH-hPAEC. Aim 2) To elucidate the effects
of SIN3a deficiency in the onset of PAH in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells using a dual approach. Aim
3) To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SIN3a modRNA in preclinical models of PAH. Defining the regulatory
mechanisms underlying the loss of BMPR2 expression in PAH will be of great relevance. Finally, restoring the
expression of SIN3a in the lungs using SIN3a modified RNA might be a new promising strategy for treating PAH."

The Dissemination and Outreach (D&O) Core is an essential component of the Prospective Genetic Risk
Evaluation and Assessment Study (PROGRESS) in Autism Center. Our multidisciplinary Center will
prospectively identify and partner with a cohort of families whose children are at identified genetic risk (IGR) for
autism. Parents will receive genetic screening results prior to any clinical indication of developmental delays or
differences, which creates opportunities for early interventions, however receiving this information also carries
ethical concerns for the well-being of the parents, especially in minoritized communities. The D&O Core will
accomplish the PROGRESS Center’s overarching goals of rapidly disseminating research findings to
stakeholders, supporting families, engaging and communicating with the autistic community, and training new
investigators, through four aims: Aim 1, Dissemination of PROGRESS Center Results, is imperative to inform
scientific exchange, clinical practice, affected communities, and downstream policy. We will use in-person and
online seminars and town halls, as well as the PROGRESS Center website, to share information with autistic
individuals, families, clinicians, educators, and scientists. Aim 2, Outreach and Support, will optimize
information and support for PROGRESS Cohort families as well as others impacted by IGR of autism through
individual and group family navigation sessions to help parents and infants gain access to early intervention
services. Aim 3, Translation and Exchange, will optimize bidirectional communication and collaboration
between the autism community stakeholders and PROGRESS investigators through a Community Advisory
Board to cultivate an authentic community-academic partnership that informs approaches to share results with

Population-based newborn screening through sequencing-based genetic testing to predict risk of autism before
symptoms emerge may benefit families, e.g., by facilitating early assessment and intervention, but the prospect
also raises questions about the effects of this information on parents. PROGRESS Center Project 2 will examine
the behavioral and psychosocial impact of informing parents about their newborn’s elevated genetic risk
of developing autism. Led by researchers with extensive experience investigating the impact of genetic
information, the project will collect empirical data both to characterize the immediate effects of the genetic
information and to understand how its impact unfolds over the course of the first two years of the child’s
life. We will survey parents who learn that their newborn is genetically susceptible to autism immediately after
they receive this genetic information, comparing their responses to those of parents whose children were not
identified as being at genetic risk of autism to assess the impact of the genetic information on parents’ emotions,
relationships, life plans, intentions, and expectations. We will also investigate the stability of these effects by
resurveying the parents 12 months after completion of the initial survey. In addition, we will examine how
ultimately receiving an autism diagnosis colors retrospective evaluations of the effects of receiving the genetic
information during the newborn period by surveying parents from the identified genetic risk (IGR) group whose
children did and did not receive an autism diagnosis at 24 months of age. We will explore parental reactions in
further depth using qualitative interviews to understand the impact and value of receiving genetic information.
Interviews will be conducted with a diverse sample of parents of children from the IGR group, exploring their
emotional reactions, impact on expectations about their children’s lives, impact on parenting behavior, and views
about whether and how such information should be delivered to parents in the future. Additional interviews with
parents whose children receive an autism diagnosis during the study will explore their views on having earlier
received genetic risk information. Project 2 will be an integral part of the Center and will be closely linked to
Project 1 (which will identify the cohort of IGR newborns) and Project 3 (with which Project 2 will share data to
study the relationship between quantitative psychosocial measures and observed parent-child interactions), as
well as with the Assessment Core (which will identify families whose children meet criteria for autism and
collaborate on post-diagnosis surveys), the Statistical and Computational Analysis Core (which will assist in the
analysis of quantitative data), and the Dissemination and Outreach Core (which will collaborate on the
communication of Project 2’s findings and their social, bioethical, and policy implications to relevant
stakeholders). Project 2’s findings will allow clinicians to anticipate the consequences of providing parents
of newborns with genetic information regarding susceptibility to autism, setting the stage for more effective
communication, mitigation of negative effects, and enhancement of positive adaptations."
10916387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic screening can now identify risk variants before the emergence of behavioral symptoms of autism. This
advance affords opportunity for presymptomatic intervention in infants whose developmental trajectories indicate
early deviation from typical patterns. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined whether the combination
of genetic screening and precise trajectories of early neurodevelopmental pathways might enable earlier
diagnosis in infants with identified genetic risk for autism. Based on this significant knowledge gap, Project 3
proposes to longitudinally assess neurodevelopment every 3 months when infants are 3 to 15 months of age.
The PROGRESS cohort will include a final sample of N = 300 infants: N = 200 in the Identified Genetic Risk
(IGR) group and N = 100 gestational age, sex, race/ethnicity, language, and zip code-matched control infants
without Identified Genetic Risk (non-IGR). We will examine developmental trajectories of autonomic nervous
system and neural function (Aim 1), information-gathering perception and action systems (Aim 2: visual, auditory,
multisensory, motor), and social development and language/communication (Aim 3) to determine if and when
these trajectories deviate across genetic risk groups. Being situated in the PROGRESS Center allows us to
combine measures across multiple levels of analysis (Aim 4) including genetic risk (Project 1), parental
experience and self-efficacy (Project 2), trajectories of neurodevelopment (Project 3), and diagnostic outcomes
(Assessment Core). We pair this innovative design with sophisticated statistical modeling techniques (Statistical
and Computational Analysis Core) to elucidate developmental mechanisms and to enable earlier diagnosis in
infants at identified genetic risk for autism. We will partner with the Dissemination and Outreach Core to share
emerging knowledge and to provide parents with appropriate support and linkage to early intervention services.
In summary, Project 3 leverages a representative sampling strategy in a diverse large city, a large sample size
paired with dense longitudinal assessments, and a multidisciplinary team science approach, to characterize
neurobehavioral trajectories in infants at identified genetic risk of autism."

The proposed career development application provides research training for Dr. Jiaying Liu to facilitate her
transition to independence. The goal of the proposed research is to identify neurobehavioral makers of nicotine
use escalation and cigarette smoking initiation among young adult (YA) users of electronic nicotine delivery
systems (ENDS). Findings are expected to inform regulatory policy and improve YA responsiveness to public
health campaign communications. Given the accumulating evidence that ENDS use conveys 5-fold additional
risk for smoking initiation and other tobacco use escalation, recent YA increases in use are alarming,
threatening a resurgence of dependence that may reverse decades of tobacco control success. Therefore, it is
crucial to identify predictive markers of smoking initiation and tobacco use escalation in this vulnerable
population, and to provide actionable evidence that informs regulatory and prevention efforts. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) generates information complementary to traditional behavioral risk
assessments, with direct observations of the neural substrates that underlie the subjective states known to
perpetuate addiction, in order to yield objective and putatively more predictive measures. Assessment of
behavioral and brain markers associated with smoking onset and tobacco use escalation is proposed. The goal
is to determine whether baseline neurobehavioral markers will predict smoking transition and tobacco use
escalation beyond traditional makers at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. A one-year public service announcement (PSA)
intervention with a cross-over design will also be conducted, in which two message exposure orders and one
control condition allow testing whether novel anti-ENDS PSAs addressing harms associated with ENDS flavors
will more effectively prevent tobacco use escalation compared to the existing regular PSAs. The proposed
research is among the first that aims to inform regulation of flavored ENDS marketing, and to provide
recommendations for developing effective PSAs for prevention campaigns. These aims directly address
multiple priorities of FDA Center for Tobacco Products (Marketing Influences, Communications, Behavior and
Addiction), and they are expected to pinpoint effective regulatory gates to address the current ENDS epidemic.
Dr. Liu’s long-term goal is to become an independent researcher translating communication neuroscience
research to regulatory actions for improvements in health campaigns and interventions utilizing persuasive
anti-tobacco messaging. Her near-term goal is to prepare a competitive R01 application to implement
randomized controlled trials of PSAs to maximize impact on deterrence of smoking and substance use
transition among ENDS users. The proposed training experience is designed to develop competencies in (a)
neuroscience, (b) functional neuroimaging, (c) tobacco regulatory science, and (d) grant writing. The proposed
research study provides focus for training and preliminary data to support a competitive R01 application."

The normal cell of origin (COO) from which a cancer arises is fundamental to our basic notions of cancer
development. COOs are central to the standard of care for hematopoietic cancers, where they inform
prognosis and guide therapy. However, COOs are not incorporated into the clinical paradigms for treating lung
adenocarcinomas, an epithelial cancer that is among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The major
reason for this is that we still don’t know the COO for most lung adenocarcinomas or whether the COO varies
from patient to patient. One major scientific obstacle to addressing this question is the limited understanding of
lung cell types, and epithelial types in general. A second obstacle is lineage infidelity that occurs during lung
cancer progression, which can obscure the COO when one analyzes tumors morphologically or
transcriptionally. As a result, the field has been required to rely on genetically engineered mouse models,
which are still limited in their ability to fully recapitulate genotypes and clinical features of human lung
adenocarcinomas. Recent work by us and others in the field has shown that genome-wide patterns of
passenger mutations can provide a patient-specific COO signal. However, this hypothesis has not been tested
rigorously for lung cancer or for other malignancies. In this study, we investigate how passenger mutation
patterns inform COOs in lung cancer. In particular, we focus on noncoding surfactant protein gene (SPG)
insertions and deletions, which our recent study (Cell 2017) and preliminary data establishes as one of the
most common mutational events in lung adenocarcinoma (30-40% of patients). In this study, we hypothesize
that this mysterious but highly prevalent mutational pattern is a somatic genetic “tattoo” of alveolar type II (AT2)
cell origin in SPG mutant lung adenocarcinomas. We will investigate this through deep profiling of tumor
adjacent tissue using targeted and single cell sequencing. In addition, we will investigate whether SPG mutant
lung adenocarcinomas are associated with distinct evolutionary trajectories, with respect to their mutational,
transcriptional, and histological state. Finally, we will build on our preliminary studies that establish compelling
links between genome distributions of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in lung cancer and cell-type
specific gene expression profiles obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing of benign lung. These preliminary
data indicate that some lung adenocarcinomas may have proximal (club or basal cell) rather than distal (AT2
cell) origins. We will build on our initial findings, to generate and analyze higher depth atlases of healthy lung
and correlate the patterns of cell type specific transcriptional and open chromatin profiles with genomic
distributions of somatic SNVs. This work will provide some of the first direct evidence to map human lung
adenocarcinoma to specific COOs. Furthermore, our establishment of rigorous links between passenger
mutational patterns and COO in lung cancer may have broader applicability to the study of COOs in other
prevalent and deadly human epithelial cancers."
10916277,"Project Summary
 Organisms that reproduce sexually utilize a specialized cell division program called meiosis to reduce their
chromosome number by half to generate haploid gametes. Proper execution of this process is crucial for a
successful pregnancy, since errors in meiotic chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy (incorrect
chromosome number in the embryos), the leading known cause of miscarriages and birth defects in humans.
Meiosis in females is especially error prone and this vulnerability has a profound impact on human health: it is
estimated that 10-25% of human embryos are chromosomally abnormal, and the vast majority of these defects
arise from problems with the female meiotic cells (called oocytes). However, despite the importance of female
meiosis for successful reproduction and human health, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that act
to ensure accurate chromosome partitioning in oocytes.
 Oocytes have some special features that necessitate the use of novel cell division mechanisms. Perhaps
most significantly, oocytes lack centrosomes, which define and organize the spindle poles in other cell types;
therefore, spindles in these cells must assemble using different mechanisms. Using C. elegans as a model, we
previously demonstrated that acentrosomal spindle assembly proceeds by 1) nucleation/stabilization of
microtubules adjacent to the disassembling nuclear envelope, 2) sorting of microtubules such that their minus
ends are positioned at the periphery of the array, 3) organization of these ends into nascent poles, and 4)
coalescence of these sites until bipolarity is achieved. Moreover, we have identified proteins required for key
events in this pathway, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this form of spindle assembly.
 Building on these discoveries, the goals of the proposed work are to: 1) deepen our understanding of
acentrosomal spindle assembly and organization, and 2) investigate mechanisms that promote the formation
and stability of acentrosomal spindle poles in both C. elegans and mammalian oocytes. These approaches will
enable us to gain a mechanistic understanding of oocyte meiosis, an important yet poorly understood form of
specialized cell division."

The Paul Calabresi Career Development Award for Clinical Oncology (K12 Program) at the City of Hope
Comprehensive Cancer Center has been funded for more than 25 years. The overarching goal of the K12
Program is to develop a new generation of clinical oncology investigators capable of translating basic
advances in cancer biology into novel strategies for the diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of malignant
disease. To this end, the K12 Program provides a structured, multidisciplinary approach to training and
mentoring junior faculty to ensure their success as clinician researchers and leaders in cancer research.
Eligible candidates are within five years of completing their training and are selected from a variety of
specialties. The Principal Investigator/Program Director, Associate Director, Program Administrator/Curriculum
Director, and seven faculty members constitute the Advisory Committee. This Committee selects the Scholars,
regularly assesses their academic progress, and provides input on the curriculum. Annually, two external
advisors evaluate the overall program and the progress of the current Scholars. The four-year K12 Program
begins with the year-long Clinical Investigator Training Program, which provides structured coursework in
topics including study design, statistics, team building, protocol writing, good clinical practice, responsible
conduct of research, and grant writing. Practical skills training in leadership and data presentation are
incorporated throughout the four years. Each Scholar identifies a clinical and laboratory mentor who provide
support throughout the Scholar’s completion of a translational research project, for which they are guaranteed
protected time. The Scholars meet quarterly with the Advisory Committee and formally present their research
progress biannually for critique and input on their progress. The Program Director and Associate Director meet
individually with the Scholars on a quarterly basis to review the critiques of the Advisory Committee and to
provide Scholars with the opportunity to troubleshoot any problems or barriers to their career development.
Scholars are also encouraged to provide suggestions for program improvement. The K12 Program continues
to evolve with the addition of new mentors and enhancements to the curriculum. Participation in the program is
considered prestigious by both the Scholars and their mentors. The value of the K12 Program is evident in the
success and productivity of our Scholars. The nineteen K12 Scholars enrolled in the past 10 years have
produced 853 publications, 227 of which are first-author publications, and 199 of which are senior-author
publications. They have been awarded 109 grants including three NIH R01s, an NIH R03, an NIH R21, four
other NIH grants, 25 foundation grants, and 75 others. Eighteen of the nineteen Scholars continue as
academic faculty and all have been promoted or are in the process of being promoted to the level of Professor
or Associate Professor, emphasizing the ability of our program to train independent clinical investigators."

 Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intraocular cancer in the United States and accounts for about
5% of all kinds of melanomas. Approximate 50% of UM patients develop metastases, predominantly to the liver
with 100% mortality. UM lacks mutations in BRAF, NRAS, NF1 and KIT common to other melanoma types.
Instead, over 90% harbor somatic activating mutations in the Gaq family members GNAQ or GNA11, with the
remainder carrying mutations of genes also acting in the Gaq signaling pathway such as CYSLTR2, a Gaq-
coupled GPCR, phospholipases C b4 (PLCb4), a direct effector of Gaq. Therefore, UM is genetically defined by
activating mutations of the Gaq pathway. Despite dramatic successes in other melanoma subtypes, immune
checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate clinical benefits in UM, leading to an
urgent need to develop novel and effective therapeutic regimens. The CYSLTR2->Gaq->PLCb-> protein kinase
C (PKC) module is a linear signaling cascade that drives the essential MAP-kinase (MAPK) signaling for UM cell
proliferation, making Gaq pathway the prime target for targeted therapy for this devasting disease. Although both
GNAQ/11 and PKC inhibitors are very effective to suppress UM cell proliferation/survival in vitro, targeting either
GNAQ/11 or PKC alone has shown limited efficacy in UM liver metastasis. Understanding the resistance to the
Gaq pathway inhibition is of paramount importance to develop new strategies that work in the specific signaling
context of a constitutively activated Gaq pathway. Our preliminary data show either GNAQ/11 inhibition or PKC
inhibition yields strong upregulation of the Gaq-coupled receptor EDNRB, which when encountering its ligand
EDN1 from the liver environment can lead to reactivation of MAPK, thus driving resistance to Gaq pathway
inhibition in UM. In this proposal, we will evaluate that blocking endothelin signaling will increase the therapeutic
efficacy of targeting oncogenic Gaq signaling, directly or downstream, using newly developed genetically
engineered and xenograft models of UM metastatic to the liver. While the role of endothelin signaling in
melanocyte development and melanoma progression is well documented, the nature of the feedback that
upregulates EDNRB expression/signaling is not understood. We will utilize a combination of candidate
approaches, RNAseq and phospho-proteomics to dissect the underlying mechanisms in UM cells and in
melanocytes. Our preliminary data also show that secondary mutations in GNA11 can confer resistance to the
Gaq inhibition. In this proposal, we will expand the emerging landscape of the mechanism underlying the
adaptive and acquired resistance to Gaq pathway inhibition and identify rational therapy combinations to improve
the therapeutic efficacy for metastatic UM. Using a combined genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 synthetic lethality
screen and phospho-proteomic screen we identified a lipid synthesis pathway that is essential for the survival of
cells with Gaq mutation, which we will explore as entirely novel therapeutic target for UM."
11196157,"The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 ""core conditions"" and that 26 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Since acceptance of the core conditions, 5 additional ones have been added. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening."

 The main goal of this project is to develop a neurosteroid therapy to mitigate seizures and morbidity caused by
nerve agents and organophosphate (OP) compounds in children and elderly population. Exposure to nerve agents
or OP poisoning can result in persistent seizures, status epilepticus (SE), and severe brain injury. Current
benzodiazepine anticonvulsants do not sufficiently protect from SE, a prolonged seizure activity lasting 30 min or
longer with significant neuronal injury and mortality. Recently neurosteroids have been identified as anticonvulsants
that can effectively control OP seizures and brain injury in adult models. However, the children and elderly are
more vulnerable to nerve agent neurotoxicity, but very few medical countermeasures are available to
protect these populations. This project seeks to address this gap by optimizing a specific anticonvulsant against
nerve agents to stop seizures and prevent brain damage in the pediatric and elderly population. Recent studies
shows that neurosteroids that enhance phasic and extrasynaptic tonic inhibition are strong anticonvulsants against
seizures and brain damage caused by nerve agents. Post-exposure neurosteroid therapy has been shown to be
more effective anticonvulsant and neuroprotective than midazolam in OP intoxication models. The objective of
this project is to determine the efficacy and safety of the synthetic neurosteroid ganaxolone (GX) as ‘broad-
spectrum’ anticonvulsant for nerve agent and OP intoxication in pediatric and aged models. The main
emphasis is focused on IND-enabling efficacy optimization, mechanism, and safety validation of GX in pediatric
rats. The project will address three specific aims: (Aim 1): To determine the efficacy of GX against DFP- and soman-
induced seizures and neuropathology in pediatric rats; (Aim 2): To determine the efficacy of GX against DFP- and
soman-induced seizures and neuropathology in aged rats; and (Aim 3): To determine the pharmacokinetic and
safety profile of GX in pediatric and aged rats and prepare a pre-IND application under the Animal Rule pathway.
The progressive “go/no-go” milestones plan includes quantitative criteria for the success of key studies focusing
on four primary outcome measures: (i) anticonvulsant efficacy; (ii) acute neuroprotectant efficacy; (iii) prevention of
chronic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation; and (iv) attenuation of epilepsy and long-term neurological
dysfunction. The overall impact of the project’s outcomes will be very high for the development of lifesaving
anticonvulsant drug for OP intoxication in pediatric and elderly population, which is a high priority civilian therapeutic
field for the CounterACT program."
10916470,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Celiac disease (CeD), a complex T cell-mediated enteropathy induced by dietary gluten in HLA-DQ2 or HLA-
DQ8 individuals, currently affects 1% of the global population. While CD4 T cells are required for the
development of villus atrophy (VA), the effector cells mediating intestinal epithelial cell destruction (IEC) are
intraepithelial cytotoxic lymphocytes (IE-CTLS). Currently, the only effective CeD treatment is a lifelong gluten-
free diet (GFD). However, 30-40% of adult CeD patients fail to restore a completely normal intestinal
morphology on a GFD, and complete avoidance of gluten can be challenging. During the last funding period,
we generated the first HLA and gluten-dependent mouse model of CeD (CeD-tg) that recapitulates the
intricacies of CeD pathogenesis. We will take advantage of the CeD-tg mouse model and our expertise in
human immunology, to (i) further dissect the mechanisms underlying tissue destruction, and (ii) profile the
clinical spectrum of CeD using high dimensional single cell technologies with the goal of identifying new
therapeutic avenues and biomarkers predicting tissue destruction. The central hypothesis emerging from our
studies is that IE-CTL integrate signals from CD4 T cells and IEC to become licensed killer cells and mediate
tissue destruction. Furthermore, while it is acknowledged that IEC play a role in IE-CTL activation, their role in
CeD pathogenesis and how they impact on IE-CTL activation has not been investigated. The proposed specific
aims are:1) Establish the role of epithelial cells in T cell-mediated CeD immunopathology using the CeD Tg
mouse model; 2) Establish the Impact of γδ and CD4 T cells, IFNγ, IL-15 on IE-CTL activation in CeD-tg mice;
and 3) Profile the heterogeneity of potential and active CeD. The goal is to provide a knowledge base that will
help identify appropriate treatment strategies to individual patients, and help predict which potential CeD
patients (patients who have develop inflammatory anti-gluten immunity but conserve a normal intestinal
architecture) are at high risk of developing VA. The studies proposed will have a significant positive impact on
human health because they will help define curative and preventive strategies that have the potential to
prevent tissue destruction in celiac disease."

Chemotherapy for primary breast cancer causes significant declines in cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)
predisposing patients to increased symptom burden and increased risk of morbidity and mortality from cancer
and non-cancer conditions. Randomized trials demonstrate aerobic training (AT) is feasible during chemotherapy
for primary breast cancer and attenuates treatment-induced impairments in CRF. However, our recent findings
indicate that even with AT during and after chemotherapy, CRF remains substantially below normative values,
and less than 25% of patients have a clinically meaningful CRF response. Increasing the dose of AT substantially
increases CRF response; however, higher AT doses are associated with lower AT adherence. Thus, use of a
conventional dose-response design wherein patients are assigned to fixed doses is likely imprudent considering
lower fixed AT doses will result in underdosing in some patients, and poor adherence in others. A more patient-
centered approach used in drug trials is flexible dosing, where the dose is escalated for each patient as tolerated.
There have been no trials directly assessing the efficacy of flexible AT dosing on CRF in any cancer setting. To
address this fundamental knowledge gap in exercise-oncology research, the objective of this study is to
compare the effects of flexible versus standard fixed AT dosing and response-adapted AT on CRF response. In
this randomized trial, a total of 140 inactive (<90 mins of moderate-intensity exercise/wk) patients with primary
breast cancer scheduled to initiate chemotherapy will be randomly allocated (1:1) to Flexible dosing: Individual
AT doses escalated; or Standard fixed dosing: 90 mins/week for ~32 weeks (during and after chemotherapy).
Patients who do not respond (<3.50 ml/kg/min CRF improvement) at 32 weeks will complete 20 weeks of
extended flexible dosing AT. We will address 3 specific aims: AIM 1: Compare the effects of flexible versus
standard dosing on CRF response rate. AIM 2: Ascertain the effects on adherence, safety, and patient-reported
outcomes. AIM 3: Evaluate the effects of extended AT in CRF non-responders. IMPACT: This study challenges
the current dogma that all patients respond equally to a fixed AT dose and will be the first to evaluate flexible AT
dosing in any cancer population. Receiving cancer treatment is not a qualifying condition for structured AT and,
as such, AT is not currently considered a standard aspect of cancer management. We anticipate the proposed
trial will directly address an unmet clinical need by identifying the AT regimen that maximizes CRF response rate
and, if successful, findings from this investigation will help guide the AT regimen for translation to clinical care."
10916473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background. In Nigeria, sexual minority men (SMM) have disproportionately higher levels of HIV
compared to the general population. With high adherence, daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
reduces risk for HIV acquisition among SMM. Increasing PrEP uptake and adherence could
significantly reduce HIV incidence, but to date no PrEP intervention have focused on SMM in Nigeria.
The scientific premise of this K01 application is that a telehealth delivery model for PrEP could
circumvent barriers to PrEP access for SMM in Nigeria. There is a strong proof of concept for the
proposed approach given that telehealth interventions to enhance PrEP access have been shown to
be acceptable and have increased PrEP uptake and adherence, among SMM in the U.S. While
telehealth interventions in Nigeria have increased utilization of other health services, no study has
investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of delivering PrEP health services to SMM in
Nigeria through a telehealth approach.
Overview of project. My long-term goal is to become an independent researcher with expertise in
developing and testing telehealth interventions to improve HIV prevention and care outcomes among
SMM in sub-Saharan Africa. In Year 1, I will conduct qualitative interviews with HIV-negative SMM
(n=20), peer educators (n=20), and healthcare providers (n=20) in Lagos Nigeria to identify the
content, format, and foreseeable challenges to implementing a telemedicine intervention to increase
PrEP awareness, uptake, and adherence among SMM. In Year 2, I will conduct qualitative interviews
with SMM (n=30) to iteratively design a telemedicine intervention to increase PrEP uptake and
adherence among SMM in Lagos, Nigeria. In Years 3-5, I will conduct a pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the telemedicine intervention
to optimize PrEP adherence over 6 months with 90 PrEP-naïve, HIV-negative high risk SMM in
Lagos, Nigeria. My successful completion of the proposed research and training aims will position me
to submit a R01 in the final year of this grant to conduct a multisite, RCT to test the intervention’s
efficacy."
10916241,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The site-specific ubiquitylation of histone proteins can dictate whether a gene gets expressed or silenced, thus,
this type of modification is indispensable for normal development and cellular homeostasis. By contrast, the
mis-regulation of histone ubiquitylation can result in developmental lethality, neurodegeneration, and aging.
~1–2% of histone H2B is mono-ubiquitylated (H2Bub1) during interphase, ranking this protein alongside some
of the most ubiquitylated by abundance. H2Bub1 has been shown to promote gene expression through
multiple mechanisms. Strikingly, H2Bub1 disappears from metaphase chromosomes and reaccumulates as
cells exit from mitosis, but considering recent reports, which challenge the long-held view that histones function
to condense chromatin into higher-order structures in vivo, why the state of H2B ubiquitylation needs to be
reset during each cell cycle is incompletely understood. Thus, there is a pressing need to elucidate why and
how H2Bub1 is stripped from mitotic chromosomes. Multiple deubiquitylases (DUBs) have been shown to
catalyze the removal of ubiquitin from H2Bub1, nonetheless, it remains to be seen how they cooperate with
one another, if there are yet unidentified DUBs specific for H2Bub1, the genomic sites they regulate, and when
they function during the cell cycle. Our working hypothesis posits that each H2Bub1-specific DUB targets
overlapping but distinct genomic regions to ensure the rapid clearance of H2Bub1 on mitotic chromosomes. To
address this hypothesis, we will use a multidisciplinary approach, integrating classical biochemical approaches
with global measurements. More specifically, we propose to identify the key DUBs that target H2Bub1, to
elucidate the extent of their redundancy, to characterize their mechanisms of action, and to examine how they
influence gene expression throughout the cell cycle. Though this work aims to uncover the purpose of histone
deubiquitylation during mitosis, we also expect to gain new insights into the basic principles of ubiquitin-
dependent gene regulation, including mechanisms of spatiotemporal control, cooperativity and interplay
between DUBs, and crosstalk with other chromatin-modifying enzymes. Finally, our work will have major
implications in how dividing cells maintain their transcriptional memory to ensure the faithful propagation of
cellular identity to future generations, and this study will have a positive impact by providing a fresh context for
understanding ubiquitin-dependent disorders and may reveal how best to develop therapeutic strategies to
combat these diseases."

In the bioengineering, there is a growing emphasis on the importance of healthcare-related
problem identification, ideation, creativity, critical thinking, team-based collaboration, and medical
device commercialization. Yet, no systematic education mechanisms are integrated into the
bioengineering curriculum to allow biomedical engineering students to identify healthcare-related
problems, envision solutions within the constraints imposed by the clinical environment, work in
an interdisciplinary inclusive team-based environment, and learn medical device
commercialization process. To this end, our overarching objective is to prepare competent
biomedical engineers through the creation of holistic medical need-driven design and device
commercialization pipelines that expand from the freshman through super-senior years. The
holistic medical need-driven design process pipeline consists of 10-week clinical immersion
experience (CIE) following by 5-week clinical ideation for design program and innovative design-
oriented courses. Our ongoing collaboration with the University of Toledo Medical Center and
ProMedica will help to implement CIE seamlessly. The aim in creating a need-driven design
process pipeline is to teach crucial design components including healthcare-related problem
identification, ideation, design iteration, design constraints identification, and team-based
collaboration. The medical device commercialization pipeline consists of intellectual property
(protection), patent application, regulatory pathways, market analysis. The proposed research
education program will provide an opportunity for almost 1000 students over a five-year period to
engage with clinical faculty and industry mentors starting from the freshman through super-senior
years. While clinical faculty will help them to identify the clinical needs and possible clinical
constraints to be considered in medical device design, the industry mentors will provide
perspective and constraints for the production and commercialization of the designed product.
Our ongoing relations with industry mentors due to mandatory co-op program will provide
sustainable support from the biomedical device industry for the proposed activities."

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and is projected to affect 112 million people worldwide
by 2040. Women represent 59% of the glaucoma population, highlighting the need to understand if there are
sex-specific risk factors for glaucoma. For example, early menopause increases the risk of developing glaucoma.
Estrogen receptor polymorphisms in women are associated with ocular hypertension (an important causal risk
factor for glaucoma). Moreover, menopause causes a 1-3 mmHg increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), while
hormone therapy containing estrogen reduces IOP. These data suggest that the age of menopause, menopause
and estrogen levels influence glaucoma risk or IOP, but the mechanism(s) is unknown.
IOP is affected by many factors, but aqueous outflow resistance is the key determinant, which is primarily
controlled by trabecular meshwork (TM) function. Outflow resistance is segmental with high and low flow regions,
and segmental flow correlates with TM stiffness. Notably, menopause and estrogen levels affect the stiffness of
many tissues, suggesting a possible mechanism by which altered estrogen levels affect IOP. These changes in
segmental flow may be related to altered protein expression since menopause alters protein levels known to
influence aqueous outflow resistance. Thus, it is hypothesized that menopause increases IOP by increasing
aqueous outflow resistance through stiffening the TM in high and low flow regions, thus increasing a
woman’s risk of developing glaucoma. This proposal addresses the hypothesis in an animal model of
menopause by measuring IOP and aqueous outflow resistance (Aim 1), and regional TM stiffness using Atomic
Force Microscopy (Aim 2).
This proposal achieves these aims using several approaches: Experiment A employs a well-established model
of menopause, ovariectomy (OVX), in young (age 3-4 months) and middle-aged (age 9-10 months) female
Brown Norway rats, and physiological menopause in elderly female rats (age 18-19 months). Experiment B will
determine if topical estrogen therapy mitigates the effects of menopause, and investigates if this therapy affects
IOP, outflow resistance, and TM stiffness in elderly male rats (age 18-19 months). In all animals, IOP will be
measured using rebound tonometry for 8 weeks, followed by measurement of outflow resistance (via iPerfusion)
and regional TM stiffness (via atomic force microscopy) in one eye. Contralateral eyes will be used to assess:
estrogen levels or structure and composition along the outflow pathway. Preliminary data support this hypothesis,
showing that IOP and aqueous outflow resistance are increased after OVX. This proposal will build on these
data and expects to demonstrate that menopause increases TM stiffness and that topical estrogen therapy
prevents these changes. These findings will provide functional and mechanistic insight into the association
between menopause and glaucoma, and the benefits of topical estrogen therapy as a treatment for glaucoma."

Since its establishment in 1975 as a non-profit organization, the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. (ITCA) has
advocated for self-determination for its Member Tribes through public policy development, research, and
education. The membership of ITCA is comprised of leaders from 21 federally recognized tribes in Arizona.
ITCA operates more than 30 projects and employs a staff of 70 to provide technical assistance and training to
tribal governments in program planning and development, research and data collection, resource development,
education, health, management and evaluation. Strengthening tribal governance is at the core mission of
ITCA including taking action on matters that affect Member Tribes individually or collectively and promoting
tribal sovereignty.
The University of Arizona and the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona boasts a successful 20-year partnership
through the NARCH program in the American Indian Research Center for Health (AIRCH) along with
establishing new relationships with Arizona State University. Our application for the Native American Research
Center for Health XII (NARCH XII) focuses on improving health disparities in our Tribes by strengthening tribal

1. A capacity building project to assist Tribes with building research capacity to support ITCA Member
 Tribes in implementation and evaluate their own community-based research projects through a
 competitive process to receive technical assistance and mentorship from a team of American Indian
 researchers at The University of Arizona;
2. A student career enhancement program to establish the Rising Stars Program to create a health,
 science, technology, engineering, math field (HSTEAM) outreach program for American Indian/Alaska
 Native (AI/AN) students and develop a HSTEAM Ambassador program with AI/AN students;
3. A faculty/researcher project to apply an innovative Indigenous ethics and data governance framework
 grounded in Indigenous Peoples’ rights to equip early career researchers in Arizona with knowledge,
 tools, and perspectives to create research relationships with tribal nations and Indigenous communities
 that advance and benefit Indigenous Peoples rights and interests with collaborative partners;
4. A pilot project to establish vector-borne disease research committees in each tribal community by
 examining community-level risk perception, conduct evaluative surveillance of arthropod vectors and
 establish ongoing independent, needs-based, vector surveillance capabilities within tribal communities
 is ideal;
5. A research project proposing on using data from emergency departments and hospitals throughout the
 United States, to compare psychiatric diagnoses assigned to AI/ANs with substance use disorders to
 assist policy makers and public health experts to actively address concerns if indicated and;
6. A pilot project to evaluate the isotopic abundance of wastewater extracts via high-resolution mass

10917096,"PROJECT SUMMARY: FACULTY/RESEARCHER CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROJECT – Enhancing
early career research ethics to support Indigenous data governance in Arizona
The proposed faculty/researcher enhancement project, the “Indigenous Data Governance Fellows” program,
targets early career faculty at the three public universities in Arizona (AZ) in a broad array of disciplines related
to health research with tribes and Indigenous communities in AZ. Health research as a transdisciplinary field
includes researchers who may have received ethics training in their own disciplines, yet many working with
tribal nations in AZ have not been trained in Indigenous research ethics or data governance practices. This
project intends to fill knowledge gaps in research ethics with Indigenous rights holders to promote a future of
more equitable science practices that protect Indigenous communities and their data. Using a cohort model
with early career faculty, the project will train 60 Fellows over 4 years. This project will also enhance
relationships among tribal serving researchers at AZ universities, enhance tribally driven research, and help
develop university policies and practices. This project links to ongoing research work on tribal, federal, and
university law, policy, and ethics for ethical Indigenous research and data governance. Our long-term goal is to
enhance tribal research and data governance in AZ. Our project objective is to equip early career researchers
at the three public universities in AZ with knowledge, tools, and perspectives to conduct research and steward
data in ways that comport with the Arizona Board of Regents Tribal Consultation Policy, university policies, and
Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests. Our rationale is that as Indigenous Peoples increasingly engage with
the growing fields of health research, open data, and open science, researchers require information to
enhance their own Indigenous data governance practices for ethical research with communities. We plan to
accomplish our project objective by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Train early career
faculty/researchers in ethical research and data practices to enhance tribally-driven, community-based
research relationships by leveraging existing, cutting edge, unique coursework and training at the University of
Arizona and by growing a community of practice through four cohorts totaling 60 scholars; 2: Engage tribal
leaders, staff, community practitioners, and tribally-engaged researchers in AZ on Indigenous data governance
topics; and 3: Disseminate learnings from the Indigenous Data Governance Fellows program. Each cohort will
train 15 early stage investigators using a mix of collaborative, network cohort team meetings and innovative,
unique curriculum and training on tribal sovereignty, research relationships, mentoring Native students and
Indigenous data sovereignty, governance, and research topics."

The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Cocopah Environmental Protection Office staff, medical entomologists from
the University of California, vector-borne disease researchers from the University of Arizona and other
community partners will build upon existing participatory research and outreach partnerships in the proposed
project.
Arizona often ranks amongst the highest in West Nile virus infection and related deaths relative to other states.
Additionally, high populations of the invasive yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti in communities along
southern border areas makes mosquito and pathogen surveillance critically important. Ae. aegypti is the
primary vector of dengue and Zika viruses which circulate in the neighboring border states of Sonora and Baja
California, Mexico. Ticks are important vectors causing human disease. Among the most significant is Rocky
Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), a bacterial infection caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, which kills more people in
North America than any other tickborne disease. Native American populations are disproportionately impacted.
Since the first locally acquired case was identified in Arizona in 2003, the disease has become endemic in
many Native American communities. In Arizona, R. rickettsii is vectored by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus
sanguineus and to date there have been more than 436 cases of RMSF with a case fatality rate of 10%, which
is 15 times the national rate for this disease. There have been no surveillance efforts for vector or pathogen
prevalence outside of post-epidemic events.
Supportive efforts are needed to identify high-risk surveillance gaps, undertake vector and pathogen
prevalence assessments, and generate access to essential infrastructure and services in the short-term.
Vector-borne Disease Research Committees (VbDRC) within collaborating tribal communities will direct high
priority vector surveillance and inform Tribal leadership of technical findings. Creation of Vector Risk Mitigation
Plans and relevant community specific practicum training will be provided for tribal environmental health, public
health and medical practitioners serving communities. Additionally, investment in Native American students
through financially supported vector research experiences will help build the future public and environmental
health workforce. There is strong evidence that student research experiences improve educational persistence,
thus UA faculty and VbDRC members will mentor Native American students through community-based
research projects."

Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal genetic disease in the Caucasian population, results from mutations
in the CFTR gene and affects the epithelia of multiple organs including the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Multiple
research strategies for treatment of CF are currently being explored. Translating CF therapeutic strategies from
basic research to clinical studies requires the assessment of drug candidates in physiologically relevant assays
that require specific expertise. To support urgently required translational CF research, the Molecular/Functional
Measurement Core (Core B) of the University of North Carolina CF Research and Translation Core Center will
pursue two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 will focus on in vitro evaluation of multi-organ CF disease
pathophysiology and pre-clinical therapeutics candidates. We will provide in vitro analyses of CF primary
cultured, stem-cell derived, and freshly biopsied epithelia (GI and airway) by Ussing chamber ion transport,
biochemical measurements, and molecular studies to quantitate CFTR expression/function/maturation, organoid
swelling assays to measure CFTR function in higher throughput assays, and novel models to study inflammation,
infection, hypoxia, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of designated CF therapeutic agents and
endpoints. Specific Aim 2 will provide in vivo evaluation of CF disease pathophysiology and therapeutic
candidates utilizing animal models. Animal models include CF mice and CF rabbits, β-ENaC overexpressing
mice, secreted and tethered mucin-deficient mice, and gnotobiotic mice. We will provide mouse model
development, colony maintenance, and genotyping of mutant mice relevant to studies of CF GI and lung disease,
phenotyping of naïve and challenged animal models (mouse and rabbit) by validated GI and pulmonary
phenotyping panels, sample collection and preparation for microbiome analyses, histopathology,
immunostaining, RNAscope in situ hybridization, and q-PCR. Outcomes will include mucus burden and
clearance, infection/microbiome, inflammation, pharmacokinetics, gene expression, and ion channel-mediated
function (e.g., salivary secretion, nasal potential difference). Pharmacokinetics services are available for both
Aims by mass spectrometry. While certain assays and models provided by the Core focus on restoration of
CFTR function in CF, most of our services have broad applications to multiple research programs seeking
therapeutic benefit for CF. These services include approaches that utilize small-molecule pharmacological
interventions, gene therapy, correction of mucus defects, normalization of ion transport, and
inflammation/infection control. The availability of these models and assays will provide a translational bridge that
will support the rapid transfer of emerging drug candidates to effective therapies for CF patients."

The Quantitative Proteomics core led by Dr. Benjamin Garcia will provide cutting-edge mass spectrometry
(MS) based proteomics technologies to the P01 Project team members to help elucidate biochemical
mechanisms involved in histone and histone-like mutations in human cancers. These MS approaches will
include quantitative experiments to understand protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs)
on histone and non-histone proteins from both cultured and primary cell lines, tissue/tumors and formalin fixed
paraffin embedded (FFPE) archived samples. Although most researchers in the epigenetics and chromatin
biology fields utilize antibody based methods for histone modification characterization, antibodies have many
technical issues (such as epitope occlusion), which confound the analyses. Mass spectrometry therefore
provides a more unbiased and complementary approach, that is also more sensitive and accurate for protein
PTM analysis. The Garcia Lab has for over a decade now developed methods for histone PTM analyses. Here
in this propose we plan to continue to expand our proteomics toolbox to allow P01 team members to be able to
characterize 500 histone PTM sites in rapid fashion, perform quantitative analyses of histone combinatorial
modifications, and determine which oncogenic histone mutations affect chromatin structure. Additionally, we
will explore the downstream protein signaling pathways that are altered in epigenetically driven human
cancers, as transcriptional profiles do not always provide the most accurate pictures of protein expression.

10912807,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fatal neuroendocrine lung tumor that is challenging to treat due to
early metastasis, rapid growth, and a lack of easily targetable driver alterations. For the last ~40 years, SCLC
has been treated primarily as a single disease in the clinic with combination, platinum-based chemotherapy that
offers a median survival of only ~10-12 months. It is imperative to better understand SCLC biology to enable
development of novel treatment strategies that effectively prolong patient survival. SCLC tumors amplify or
overexpress one oncogenic MYC family member: MYC, MYCL, or MYCN. MYC-high SCLCs are metabolically
distinct from MYC-low, and have specific and targetable metabolic vulnerabilities. The most effective therapeutic
strategy for treatment of MYC-high SCLCs in preclinical trials is deprivation of circulating arginine by pegylated
arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20). MYC-high SCLCs are particularly sensitive to ADI-PEG20, because they lack
the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) that catalyzes de novo synthesis of arginine by the urea
cycle. Still, SCLC tumors eventually develop resistance to ADI-PEG20 (ADIR) that corresponds with re-
expression of ASS1. Upon ADIR, tumors acquire secondary metabolic dependencies that may be targeted to
prolong ADI-PEG20 response and patient survival. Preliminary data show that ADIR SCLC depends on serine
and one-carbon (1C) metabolism, which can be targeted with anti-folates. Preliminary data also delineate
candidate transcriptional regulators that may govern ADIR in SCLC. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a
stress-responsive transcription factor, is one predicted upstream regulator of gene programs enriched in ADIR
vs naïve SCLCs—determined by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. ATF4 is induced upon acute arginine
deprivation in SCLC and continues to be expressed with its target genes during ADIR. Here, the applicant will
employ a single-cell RNA-seq-derived model of SCLC response to ADI-PEG20, metabolite profiling, in vivo
isotope tracing, and CRISPR-based gene editing to interrogate whether ATF4 governs ADIR. The hypothesis for
this research is that ATF4 drives ADIR by enhancing serine and 1C metabolism in an ASS1-dependent manner.
Experiments will be performed in two specific aims to test whether ATF4 governs: 1) the sensitivity of MYC-high
SCLCs to ADI-PEG20, and/or 2) the sensitivity of ADIR SCLCs to 1C metabolism inhibitors. Knowledge gleaned
from this research will inform combination treatment strategies that improve the efficacy of ADI-PEG20 and
extend survival of patients with SCLC and other ASS1-low tumors. The proposed research will provide unique
opportunities for the applicant to gain expertise in cancer biology, cancer metabolism, and computational
analysis of -omics data—three major goals of the applicant’s training plan. The proposed research will occur
over three years of training at Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah, a collaborative and
resource-rich training environment, in the lab of Dr. Trudy Oliver."

Vascular anastomosis is an important surgical technique whereby closely spaced stitches are used to connect blood vessels.
This process is used frequently in organ transplantation, trauma repairs, and cardiovascular surgery. However, vascular
anastomosis is time consuming and associated with serious complications and long recovery times. Use of fibrin glue in
anastomosis has led to improved surgical outcomes and shorter operating times, but these glues are frequently impractical
as their concentrated formulations create high-density gels with short working times, low cellular infiltration, and cold
storage limitations. We have developed fibrin-based nanoparticles (FBNs) which we have used to deliver growth factors
and promote healing in vivo. Unlike traditional fibrin glues, FBNs are pre-polymerized and use physiologically relevant
fibrin/thrombin concentrations. Owing to their colloidal structure and the aforementioned properties, FBNs exhibit tunable
gelation, increased cellular infiltration, room temperature storage, and enhanced drug delivery capabilities – including of
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), a known stimulant of vascular repair. The objective of this proposal is the optimization,
characterization and in vivo analysis of paintable and patch formulations of an FBN surgical sealant with tunable growth
factor release. It is expected that these FBN sealants will demonstrate better functionality than current fibrin glues, with
the benefit of longer work time, extended stability at room temperature, targeted growth factor delivery, and improved
healing outcomes. Aim 1 will optimize the formulation of patch and flowable FBN glues. This will occur through
characterization of the effects of changes in FBN concentration, thrombin concentration, and cofactor used, on the
mechanics and functionality of the glues. Testing will probe polymerization and degradation dynamics, structure,
mechanical properties, sealant ability, and safety profile. Modalities used will include rheometry, microscopy, mechanical
testing, and novel ex vivo and microfluidic assays. Aim 2 will optimize the loading/release of FGF2 by FBNs and
characterize the effects of FGF2-FBN sealants on vascular wound healing in vitro. FGF2 loading efficiency and release
characteristics of FBN sealants will be determined and compared to high-density bulk fibrin glues. Endothelial and fibroblast
scratch tests and wound closure assays will be used to assess healing outcomes in vitro. Aim 3 will compare FBN
formulations (gel and patch; unloaded and loaded with FGF2) to current fibrin glues using an in vivo leporine model of
carotid artery anastomosis. Angiography will be use to characterize vascular morphology and histology of sampled tissues
will be used to evaluate signs of healing, restenosis, and hyperplasia. This proposal’s use of FBNs will lead to a novel
surgical sealant with improved work time and tunable drug delivery profiles that boasts superior wound healing – allowing
for faster operating times, fewer complications, and improved recovery. This technology will also increase the accessibility
of surgical glues by removing cold-chain requirements, opening up their use in varied global health applications. Training
in the associated research techniques and clinical skills required for this project will contribute to the success of the applicant
during the next phases of her career on the path to becoming an independent physician scientist."
10910107,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including post-transcriptional gene
silencing, where microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to complementary target RNAs and cause translational repression.
Argonaute (AGO) proteins and miRNAs form RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), the core players in
gene silencing. Humans have four AGO proteins, AGO1-4, which share a high sequence identity, and the
majority of miRNAs bound are common across all AGOs. Therefore, it has been thought that the four AGOs
work redundantly. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies have found that each AGO has its unique
roles in various biological processes and diseases in addition to gene silencing. Although the interaction of all
four AGOs with miRNAs has been well characterized, little is known about how each RISC recognizes its target
RNAs. Elucidation of this recognition will provide insight into the unique roles of each AGO. Meanwhile,
characterization of RISC and target interactions will facilitate target prediction accuracy by improving prediction
algorithms, which will take account of not only the complementarity between guide and target but also the type
of AGO and target interaction. In this proposed study, we will pursue the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will use cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of all four
homogenously purified RISCs with the same guide and target RNAs, which will provide insight into the
differences in target recognition by the four AGOs. In Aim 2, to clarify these differences, we recently developed
a novel SHAPE-based technique which allows us to visualize the conformational dynamics of target RNA bound
to RISC. The method will enable us to characterize this interaction within the RISC binding channel and its
periphery at a single-nucleotide resolution and can be expanded to understand how RISCs recognize guide-
binding sites buried within highly structured target RNAs. In Aim 3, we will first use mass spectrometry to identify
the unique protein binding partners of each AGO and their specific sites of interaction. Then, we will use tandem
immunoprecipitation, followed by RNA sequencing, to determine how the binding of these proteins influences
the target specificity of each AGO and directs their functionality towards alternative cellular events. The
outcome from this study will provide a solid foundation for fields beyond gene silencing and enable the
development of new strategies for higher accuracy guide-RNA drug design in therapeutic applications."
10910108,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American males, accounting for 20% of
new cancer diagnoses, but PCa is directly responsible for only 9% of cancer related deaths. PSA screening
facilitates the detection of PCa, but many of the cancers detected by PSA screening are low to intermediate
grade, resulting in overtreatment of non-aggressive PCa. Recent studies suggest an urgent need to selectively
identify “clinically significant” PCa that will result in cost-effective treatment of PCa. In the past few years,
multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) has become the standard of care for diagnosis of aggressive PCa. Although mp-
MRI guided biopsy can selectively detect higher grade PCa lesions, several recent studies acknowledge that a
considerable number of clinically important lesions are missed by mp-MRI. Furthermore, given the high cost of
MRI, the geographic variability in the availability of MRI systems, the inexact methods used to register and fuse
MRI with ultrasound for biopsy, and the dangers of Gadolinium in patients with renal insufficiency, there is a
need for a more cost-effective, alternative to detect high-grade PCa. Recent studies have demonstrated that
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can selectively detect patients with “clinically significant” PCa. New
methods have been proposed to enhance conventional ultrasound detection of PCa, including subharmonic
imaging (SHI), contrast-enhanced ultrasound dispersion imaging (CUDI) and viscoelastography. The objective
of this project is to develop a system capable of a multiparametric combination of ultrasound techniques (mp-
US) for detection of “clinically significant” PCa. We will compare 3D mp-US and mp-MRI to identify significant
PCa (defined as: Gleason score ≥ 7, a single core with > 50% involvement, or > 25% of biopsy cores positive for
PCa or as Gleason grade group ≥ 2, PSA > 10 or clinical stage of cT2b or worse). The first year of the study will
be dedicated to implementation of our mp-US technique on a commercially available 3D transrectal probe, and
to adapting a MRI-based fusion/registration system to mp-US. During the second year, we will optimize mp-US
with a machine learning approach, based upon pathologic correlation with 50 radical prostatectomy patients.
The final 3 years of the study will be dedicated to a clinical trial with 300 participants suspected of having PCa.
Each participant will receive an experimental intervention in the form of biopsy of up to 3 suspicious areas
identified by transrectal ultrasound evaluation of the prostate with mp-US. For comparison, a maximum of 3
targeted biopsy cores will also be obtained from each participant, based on mp-MRI (the clinical intervention).
Following the targeted biopsy, each participant will also receive a systematic biopsy (standard of care) consisting
of 6 laterally directed biopsy cores and 6 medially directed biopsy cores. The study is powered to demonstrate
that targeted biopsy based upon mp-US is not inferior to targeted biopsy based upon mp-MRI."
10912514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Glaucoma affects about three million Americans and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Patients
suffer from progressive optic neuropathy, for which intraocular pressure (IOP) induced mechanical insults at the
optic nerve head (ONH) play a central role. Current treatments all aim to lower IOP. While these treatments are
beneficial, many patients continue to lose vision with persistent optic nerve damage. There is a great need to
identify other modifiable risk factors, based on which novel treatments may be developed to combat this public
health problem. Biomechanically, the level of IOP-induced mechanical insults (i.e., stresses and strains) at the
ONH are not determined by IOP alone. Computational studies have shown that peripapillary sclera (PPS)
modulus and thickness are among the most influential factors. Interestingly, PPS biomechanical changes are
implicated in older age, African American race, and high myopia, which have increased glaucoma risk. However,
there is a knowledge gap in understanding the biomechanical interplay between ONH and PPS. For example,
what PPS biomechanical properties are optimal and how PPS can be modified to mitigate IOP-induced
mechanical insults at ONH remain poorly understood. We propose to use a high-resolution ultrasound
elastography technique to resolve the complex mechanical responses of the ONH and PPS through full tissue
thickness, and to begin to fill the knowledge gap. Using this technique, we will quantify ONH and PPS
deformation in normal human donor eyes, those with PPS remodeling, and those with experimental modification
of PPS properties. We will also further develop this technique for in vivo biomechanical imaging of the ONH and
PPS in an animal model. Specifically, we propose the following aims: 1) test the prediction that ONH deformation
is correlated with PPS deformation and different in older age and African American race, 2) test the prediction
that ONH deformation is different in eyes with PPS remodeling, 3) test the prediction that ONH deformation is
altered after biochemical stiffening or softening of the PPS, and 4) test the feasibility of in vivo ONH and PPS
ultrasound elastography in a pig model. Successful completion of the proposed studies will establish a clear
understanding of the biomechanical interplay between ONH and PPS, a key contributor to an individual eye’s
mechanical susceptibility to IOP. Combined with the development of an in vivo biomechanical imaging technique,
this knowledge will lay a foundation for novel diagnostic and treatment strategies to reduce glaucoma vision loss."

The human body contains thousands of small molecules, and is exposed to thousands more during daily life.
This complex chemical ecosystem reflects both the endogenous metabolism of human cells, as well as
xenobiotic exposures from our diets, our gut flora, and our natural and built environments. At present, however,
the vast majority of these small molecules remain unknown. Remarkably, this gap is not due to a lack of
appropriate experimental technology: mass spectrometry-based metabolomics routinely detects thousands of
distinct chemical signals in any biological sample. However, only a small fraction of these signals are routinely
identified. The remaining profusion of unidentified chemical entities has been dubbed the “dark matter” of the
metabolome. Computational tools to shed light on this chemical dark matter could transform our understanding
of disease pathobiology, open new avenues for personalized medicine, and increase the scope and efficiency
of any metabolomic study. At the same time, true chemical dark matter must be differentiated from the variety
of technical artefacts, contaminants, and redundant forms of the same biomolecules that are also detected by
mass spectrometry. This project proposes to establish a suite of computational tools that will dramatically
advance our ability to interpret mass spectrometry-based metabolomic datasets, and thereby begin to unlock
the dark metabolome. These tools will apply emerging techniques from the field of natural language
processing, including the same large language model (LLM) architectures that power tools like ChatGPT, to
address two of the most important unmet needs in small molecule mass spectrometry. In Aim 1, we will
develop DecipherMS, a computational tool for de novo annotation of both known and unknown chemical
structures from MS/MS spectra. Despite decades of work in computational mass spectrometry, de novo
annotation of unknown molecules remains a critical gap, with virtually all existing tools designed to search in a
database of known structures. DecipherMS will overcome this gap by using language models to decode
unknown chemical structures directly from MS/MS spectra, using a novel data augmentation strategy to learn
effectively from limited training data. In Aim 2, we will develop FoundationMS, a foundation model for mass
spectrometry-based metabolomics. FoundationMS will standardize data preprocessing workflows that are
required to identify mass spectrometric signals that should be brought forward for annotation in the first place,
which will be achieved by learning from a repository-scale corpus of metabolomic data in a self-supervised
manner. The resulting model will be fine-tuned to perform common preprocessing tasks including peak picking,
retention time alignment, adduct removal, and chemical formula assignment. Both DecipherMS and
FoundationMS will be rigorously benchmarked using appropriate datasets. Implementing these approaches in
well-documented, user-friendly, and computationally efficient software will address central gaps in our ability to
measure small molecules and shift existing paradigms in metabolomic data analysis."
10930702,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Maternal-fetal resource allocation is governed by complex maternal physiological adaptations; however,
conditions such as obesity and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are associated with a suboptimal adaptive
response to pregnancy resulting in under- or overnutrition in utero. In utero overnutrition (i.e., fetal over-
nourishment by excess exposure to maternal fuels) is a concern given the earlier onset of obesity and
cardiometabolic disease in youth. Moreover, higher glycemia and adiposity, even below thresholds of clinical
GDM and obesity, have detrimental effects on offspring health. Such metabolic heterogeneity is noteworthy as
it influences target tissues involved in fetal development, such as the placenta. Characterizing metabolic
variability in pregnant women and assessing associations with offspring metabolic health will reveal nuances in
maternal phenotypes that contribute to metabolic disease risk in offspring. However, the associations of maternal
metabolic heterogeneity with maternal fuels (e.g., glucose, insulin, lipids) and modifiable behaviors are unclear.
Moreover, it is unknown if placental signaling, which is implicated in fetal programming, reflects metabolic
heterogeneity assessed via circulating biomarkers during pregnancy. Dr. Ellen Francis’ proposal addresses
these knowledge gaps by integrating low- and high-dimensional observational data and applying advanced
statistical techniques to test the hypothesis that distinct maternal metabolic subgroups correspond to differences
in placental signaling pathways, and that the maternal subgroups and placental pathways are involved in
programming of offspring metabolic risk. This proposal will use existing samples of fasting maternal blood during
pregnancy (N=1410), placental villus tissue, and collect new metabolomics in offspring at 4-8 years of age.
Through didactic instruction and mentored training, Dr. Francis will obtain training in the analysis of ‘omics data
within a lifecourse epidemiological framework to characterize metabolic variability in pregnancy and generate
metabolic subgroups related to adiposity and maternal fuels. She will advance her understanding of placental
and developmental biology (fetal programing) by receiving extensive hands-on-training (inclusion in lab and
bench training, and conference and seminar attendance) from mentors with expertise in placental and perinatal
biology. In the independent phase, she will use training gained in the mentored phase to assess if maternal
metabolic subgroups are reflected in placental nutrient sensing pathways, generate metabolomics data in
offspring and create offspring metabolic profiles. She will then assess whether maternal metabolic subgroups
are associated with offspring metabolic profiles in childhood, and the extent to which these associations are
mediated by placental nutrient sensing pathways. Findings from these complementary studies will improve our
understanding of metabolic pathways involved in fetal development, contribute to knowledge of how maternal
metabolic variability influences metabolic risk in offspring, and could reveal key cellular and behavioral targets
for prevention strategies, while assisting Dr. Francis’ to establish a career as an independent investigator."

10913368,"Project Summary
The PI's research program aims to introduce novel wearable and implantable technologies that enable
continuous measurements of biochemical parameters for immune monitoring by addressing fundamental
scientific challenges associated with current biosensing methods. Accurate diagnosis of immune-related
diseases and realization of personalized medicine require real-time information of physical and chemical
parameters of the human body, which need to be continuously monitored at many different time scales from
minutes to days. Recent advances in bioelectronics enable many health and disease-related physical
parameters to be continuously monitored over long durations. However, continuous monitoring of biochemical
parameters in the human body remains extremely challenging. At present, very few biosensors are proven to be
clinically viable for continuous biochemical monitoring. Quantifying the temporal changes in the concentrations
of cytokines in body fluids is essential for characterizing time-resolved systemic inflammation across many
diseases. Current “end-point” methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and
fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay are not suitable for continuous monitoring of protein biomarkers, such
as cytokines. This is because of several limitations, including the reliance on external reagents and multiple
washing steps, time-consuming processes, and the need for highly trained personnel and bulky equipment.
Existing biosensors for real-time measurements of proteins do not have device built-in refreshing capabilities
and provide only a limited monitoring duration. In addition, most biosensors are limited to the quantification of
single analytes. Therefore, the PI aims to address these limitations over the next five years by developing a novel
biosensing platform that offers high sensitivity, specificity, and stability for real-time, quantitative, simultaneous,
and continuous monitoring of a panel of molecular biomarkers, including metabolites and proteins, over long
durations. Goal 1: Molecular encapsulation of biomolecules for thermal, chemical, and biological stability in
continuous monitoring. Goal 2: Multiplexed transistors for continuous detection and quantification of molecular
biomarkers. Goal 3: Soft and flexible wearable devices for automated multiparametric monitoring in vivo. The
outcomes of this proposal will enable real-time, quantitative, and continuous measurements of a panel of
molecular biomarkers for immune monitoring over long durations. The continuous molecular monitoring
technologies will serve as a platform to (i) enable timely diagnosis and prognosis of immune-related diseases
and medical conditions for prompt clinical intervention; (ii) function as molecular phenotyping tools to guide
effective therapeutic strategies; and (iii) provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of those complex
and heterogeneous diseases and medical conditions."
10913470,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic analysis of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) has revealed that up to 50% of HGSCs harbor
a genomic alteration in a DNA damage repair (DDR) gene, mostly in the BRCA repair pathway. Functional
profiling of DDR capacity of patient derived HGSC organoids has revealed that over 60% of HGSCs harbor
defects in the stalled replication fork protection DDR pathway. Further analysis of these HGSC organoids
reveals that in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a tumor which initially had a replication fork
protection defect and was carboplatin sensitive can be induced by the neoadjuvant chemotherapy to undergo
replication fork stabilization and become carboplatin resistant. Transcriptional analysis of the post-neoadjuvant
fork stable organoids reveals that these cultures have undergone an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Based
on these results, the hypothesis is that defects in the stalled replication fork protection DDR pathway are a
fundamental molecular defect in HGSC that when perturbed by treatment with neoadjuvant carboplatin can
lead to loss of the defect at the molecular level, alterations in the overall state of the tumor cells, and changes
in the way the tumor cells interact with the surrounding stroma and immune cells, all of which combine to
create a broadly therapy resistant tumor microenvironment. The research challenge I will pursue is to dissect
the evolving mechanisms by which tumor cells which originally harbor fork protection defects and are induced
to lose the defect interact with the surrounding stroma and immune cells and how these changing interactions
might be manipulated to prevent a deeply resistant tumor microenvironment. The work will utilize a novel
HGSC organoid co-culture system which will be highly innovative for the field because it will allow real time
assessment of the interactions between DDR defective or altered tumor cells and the surrounding normal cells
over time and treatment. Approach: The goal of Aim 1 is to generate growth conditions for co-cultures of fork
unstable platinum sensitive organoids with patient matched intra-tumoral stromal cells and all immune cells (T
cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and neutrophils). The goal of Aim 2 will be to generate
isogenic pairs of the organoids from Aim 1 that are fork stable and unstable and then study how the interaction
of the tumor cells with the surrounding stromal cells changes in the organoid co-culture system as the tumor
cells undergo selective fork stabilization. The goal of Aim 3 is to utilize the isogenic pairs of fork unstable and
stable organoids from Aim 2 in the co-culture system and determine how the interaction of the tumor cells with
the surrounding immune cells changes as the tumor cells undergo fork stabilization and how this may alter
response to immuno-oncologic agents. This work will have major impact in HGSC because it will help
understand the evolution of the tumor-normal cell interaction as the tumor cell fork protection defects are
altered and stressed. This may allow for the development of rational combination therapies that simultaneously
target the tumor cell defects and also prevent problematic tumor-normal cell interactions."
10913471,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than half of the world’s population is projected to be myopic (nearsighted) by 2050, significantly raising the
risk of associated vision-threatening conditions including retinal detachment, maculopathy, and glaucoma.
Despite the development of several evidence-based treatments to manage myopia progression, the prevalence
and complication rates continue to rise, and treatment efficacy is only partial. Experimental and clinical research
shows that complex gene-environment interactions are involved in the control of the post-natal growth of the eye
and its optical development, including myopia onset and progression. Research using animal models has
confirmed that visual experience and retinal defocus control eye growth and the development of refractive state
through the process of emmetropization. While progress has been made uncovering some of the biochemical
factors associated with experimental myopia, very little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular
mechanisms controlling emmetropization and myopia development.
This multi-PI consortium grant brings together experienced researchers and their established experimental non-
human primate model of emmetropization and myopia with an internationally recognized ocular genomics
research center to perform a major investigation of the retinal, RPE, choroidal, and scleral biology of post-natal
eye growth and myopia development. This project examines the functional genomics and gene-environment
interactions in the refractive development of the primate eye and will identify molecular mechanisms involved in
the development of myopia using single cell and bulk transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics. The
investigators will identify and confirm, using established bioinformatic approaches, the main components of key
regulatory pathways underlying emmetropization and myopia development. These studies will provide direct
evidence and a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of visually regulated eye growth and myopia
and will provide the largest and most comprehensive shared resource of cellular and molecular targets to date
helping develop new therapies to control eye growth and manage refractive errors.
This investigation meets three of the four NEI objectives for myopia research: to investigate the biochemical
pathways that regulate eye growth; to identify genes that contribute to the development of refractive errors; and
will help develop new technologies for assessing or treating refractive errors."

 The prevalence of depression in people living with HIV (PLWH) is estimated at 20-45% despite
antiretroviral therapy with two-thirds of adults inadequately treated, and only one-third of adults achieving
remission. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and chronic inflammation contribute to
depressive symptoms in PLWH and represent alternative pathways for targeting. Neuroactive steroids
can improve depressive symptoms in psychiatric conditions and are effective in chronic pain. In human
studies, the effect was mediated by pregnenolone, the first neuroactive steroid derived from cholesterol.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that a central mechanism of pathogenesis in neuropsychological disease
is a relative deficiency of neuroactive steroids that defines a biological subtype of depressed mood in
PLWH. Changes in neuroactive steroids promote neurological functioning by several means that include
increasing GABAergic neurotransmission and reducing systemic inflammation. To address our
hypothesis, we will perform a 3:1 double-blind trial enrolling 120 PLWH on ART with depression,
randomized to pregnenolone or placebo, as add-on therapy, for 8 weeks, and will systematically
investigate GABA-mediated inhibition and peripheral immune responses as they relate to depressed
mood. This project utilizes magnetic resonance spectroscopy and task-based functional magnetic
resonance imaging to probe the behavioral and neural responses after pregnenolone. We will
longitudinally profile immune cell populations and investigate the transcriptional responses in monocytes
to identify genes associated with clinical response. Finally, we will use baseline predictors to model
whether levels of neuroactive steroids predict clinical improvement among PLWH receiving
pregnenolone. This proposal leverages an extensive neuroimaging, and immune profiling infrastructure
and the extensive scientific expertise of collaborating investigators and laboratories. Our approach may
define novel relationships between pregnenolone and mechanisms of depression, potentially suggesting
new therapeutic targets based on the biology of neuroactive steroids, to address a critical unmet need in
PLWH."
10914098,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, affecting young adults and
increasingly aging patients. Patients with TBI suffer two distinct but closely related injuries. The primary injury is
caused by physical forces that disrupt the structural integrity of the brain and vasculature at the site of impact,
whereas the secondary injury is ischemic and inflammatory that disseminates to the most parts of the brain and
other organs such as the lungs and the heart. The transition from the primary to the secondary injury is mediated
through the blood brain barrier (BBB). BBB is a highly selective semipermeable barrier of microvasculature that
separates the circulating blood from the brain parenchyma and extracellular fluid in the central nervous system.
It consists of not only endothelial cells and the subendothelial matrix but also other perivascular cells, i.e. peri-
cytes and astrocytes, that together form the neurovascular unit. Disrupting BBB at the site of injury permits direct
exchange between blood and cerebral components, leading to intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage, and
systemic inflammation and coagulopathy. Despite extensive efforts on TBI-induced cerebral and systemic inju-
ries in the past, how local TBI disseminates the secondary injury remains poorly understood, largely due to the
lack of a physiologically relevant 3D-model system. In this proposal, we have assembled an interdisciplinary
team with expertise in microvascular engineering and vascular biology, hematology and hemostasis, TBI, and
cell signaling to reconstruct human BBB. This in vitro reconstructed BBB will 1) be 3D in its microvascular archi-
tect to contain cellular and matrix components of BBB, 2) allow for dynamic flow of blood or its components with
defined patterns and shear stresses found in arterial and venous blood flow, and 3) permit manipulation at bio-
chemical (intracellular signaling) and cellular levels (light and electron microscopy). We will use this model sys-
tem to exploit roles of blood derived factors in maintaining and disrupting the BBB integrity and function, to
identify intracellular signal pathways (the kinase inhibitor regression analysis) that contribute to BBB breakdown
and its repairs using a systems biology approach, and to develop in field or bedside devices that evaluate the
state of BBB integrity (new biomarker development) and help developing new therapeutic targets for TBI. Find-
ings from this proposed study will have numerous implications in future neurovascular engineering approaches
and therapeutic development."

completion of residency training, and for Ph.D.'s in the basic sciences who seek a broader,
translational approach to human genetics and genome sciences. Training focuses on highly
collaborative mentor-based, research laboratory experience and is complemented with courses,
seminars, clinical conferences, journal club, and participation in national meetings. As they
progress, trainees are encouraged to apply for individual fellowship awards.
A diverse faculty with interests in clinical, mathematical, population, biochemical, molecular and
developmental genetics, bioinformatics, and genomics provides a unique environment for
preparing our trainees for careers in academic medical genetics. The fifty-six participating
faculty are primarily drawn from the two Medical Genetics units in the Departments of Medicine
and Pediatrics, and the Department of Genome Sciences. We have improved our training
program during the last funding period with : 1) a new combined 4-year Pediatrics-Medical
Genetics residency 2) new faculty mentors in the Adult and Pediatric Divisions of Medical
Genetics 3) renewal of established, externally-funded research programs and 4) new
multidisciplinary research projects such as the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine, a
new clinical site in the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Network, and a sequencing center for the All
of Us research program. 5) improved recruitment and support of underrepresented minority
postdoctoral fellows. A specific focus of our program is to diversify the medical genetics
workforce by attracting underrepresented minority or disabled trainees to careers in medical
genetics. With the increasing integration of genetics into all medical specialties, we request
continued support for four funded positions per year for five years to enable the UW Medical
Genetics Postdoctoral Training Program to continue its successful mission of launching
academic, research-focused careers in medical genetics and genomics."
10914300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Controlling inflammation and cellular damage is key to preventing and treating multiple organ failure
(MOF) following trauma. However, many of the mechanisms that regulate inflammation and cell death in
specific organs remain unknown. So despite advances in supportive care for MOF patients, there have been
few advances in MOF treatments, or in our ability to adequately prevent MOF onset. Our overarching goal is
to ultimately develop new therapeutics for trauma patients based on regulating inflammatory responses and
effects on cell death following trauma and hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation (HS/R). In this proposal we
will continue to investigate downstream cell and tissue-specific effects of caspase-4 (human)/11 (mouse)
activation after HS/R. We will also assess the ability of a novel caspase-4/11 inhibitor to reduce HS/R-
mediated effects on systemic inflammation, cell death and end-organ injury. Understanding the multiple effects
of caspase-11 on inflammation and organ damage will enable us to assess the translational potential of
targeted caspase-11-inhibition for improved patient outcomes after trauma and hemorrhage.
 The most recent work on this grant defined a novel mechanism of caspase-4/11 activation (non-
canonical inflammasome) in trauma/HS/R. Caspase-4/11 is the intracellular receptor for lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and is an important mediator of inflammation during infection and sepsis. Our work showed activation of
caspase-4/11 in non-LPS-driven models of inflammation, and we defined a novel mechanism of activation of
caspase-11 by endogenous oxidized cardiolipin (CLox) on the outside of stressed mitochondria. CLox is
regulated by cytochrome c, and specific inhibition of cytochrome c inhibits caspase-11 activation and is highly
organ protective in a mouse model of HS/R. However, the mechanistic basis of detrimental effects of caspase-
11 activation in HS/R are not clear, and may be multifactorial given its multiple cell-specific inflammatory
effects, including induction of pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death), active release of inflammatory HMGB1 in
extracellular vesicles (EV) from hepatocytes after HS/R, and more recently-described effects on coagulation
through enhanced binding of tissue factor (TF) on endothelial cells (EC) in sepsis. Therefore, our main
hypothesis is that caspase-4/11 activation is detrimental during HS/R through multiple cell-specific
effects. In this proposal we will: 1: determine the role of caspase-4/11-mediated inflammation on organ
injury during HS/R; 2: determine the effects of caspase-4/11-activation on coagulation and organ injury
during HS/R; 3: determine safety and effectiveness of caspase-11-specific inhibition in mouse models
of HS/R. We expect to show specific inhibition of caspase-4/11 in HS/R is organ protective and the
mechanisms of protection are multi-factorial. We also expect to show inhibition of caspase-4/11 is an attractive
therapeutic target to reduce trauma-induced inflammation, coagulopathy and organ damage."

This proposal will result in a major new clinical decision support software system, Acuity, which will assist
Behavior Analysts (BAs) and Behavior Technicians (BTs) in the delivery of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA),
which is the leading treatment for autism. This is a proposal to develop software and perform a functional
impact and implementation outcomes study on 34 BAs recruited from 12 autism therapy clinics who will use
Acuity as part of their daily practice. The new Acuity software will integrate with existing ABA software that
clinics are already using to collect data and view charts. Acuity will offer significant improvements in treatment
planning, progress tracking, trend monitoring, dosage management, and staff assessment. Research has
shown that first-generation systems do not do enough to support overworked BAs who are overwhelmed with
the data being collected. Acuity will address critical shortfalls by enabling more agile clinical decisions across
multiple aspects of treatment, providing practitioners with new levels of rigorous, real-time insight into their
clinical data. Acuity will employ machine-learning and statistical algorithms to facilitate more accurate and
accountable timeline management for ABA treatment plans, using estimations derived from analysis of past
performance metrics and target-level effort assessment that is calibrated for the current learner. Acuity will then
help the BA compare actual to expected progress as the child with autism works towards time-based
milestones. Acuity will proactively alert BAs whenever a target exhibits notable performance trends, or when a
behavior spikes above a threshold, or dosage falls below prescribed levels. Additionally, Acuity will help with
supervision by providing a dashboard for evaluation and comparison of staff members’ overall efficiency in
therapy delivery and their adherence to prescribed target dosage. In these ways, Acuity will help BAs provide a
more responsive and effective treatment. This research will determine the success of clinics’ ability to adopt
and use Acuity, and the extent to which Acuity impacts BAs and BTs by (1) making their timeline estimates
more accurate, (2) increasing the timeliness of corrective treatment actions, and (3) improving adherence to
prescribed dosage."

In SSA, deaths occur in 5-10% of PLWH during the first year after initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) and
causes for these early deaths are not well elucidated in most patients. Many patients present with
lymphadenopathy and are empirically treated for tuberculosis (TB), even when TB testing is negative, and
may have undiagnosed lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). Access to lymph node biopsy and high-quality
pathologic evaluation are limited and often lead to missed or delayed diagnosis which may contribute to early
preventable deaths after ART initiation. The barriers to pathologic diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in Malawi
have not been extensively studied. LPDs, including lymphomas and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)
are a common causes of lymphadenopathy in PLWH, but are likely delayed and/or underdiagnosed. In the
KCH Lymphoma Study, we have enrolled all patients with newly diagnosed LPDs since 2013; 123/245 (50%)
PLWH with lymphoma and 19/35 (54%) with MCD are from Lilongwe district which makes up only 10% of the
catchment area. Given this marked overrepresentation of participants from Lilongwe, we hypothesize that
there many undiagnosed LPDs, though a gap exists in understanding the burden of LPDs in this population.
Critically, when diagnosed appropriately, LPDs are treatable and curable in SSA. To overcome barriers to
diagnosis, innovative and rapid diagnostic technologies are urgently needed to improve the speed and
accuracy of LPD diagnoses at the point of care. There a number of methods for EBV and KSHV
measurement including traditional PCR and a point of care device known as TINY. TINY is a loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based device that allows amplification and quantification of DNA at point-of-
care with operability even in settings where electricity is not available. Our collaborators have shown that
TINY is sensitive and specific for diagnosing Kaposi sarcoma from skin biopsies and can potentially
diagnose Burkitt lymphoma using EBV measurement though its utility at point of care for LPDs has not been
studied. This proposal addresses current gaps in knowledge by 1) assessing multifactorial causes of
diagnostic delay for LPDs in Malawi, 2) comprehensively describing clinical characteristics and diagnoses in
PLWH presenting with lymphadenopathy from HIV clinics, and 3) assessing utility of EBV and KSHV
measurement from FNA and blood for expedited diagnosis using standard PCR as well as TINY. In
summary, this proposal will open a research focus that is distinct from my previous work as it will be my first
time studying diagnostics and implementation science and the first time working in peripheral health centers.
This multidimensional proposal will build towards my long-term goal of improving outcomes for PLWH and
LPDs by providing critical information about prevalence of undiagnosed LPDs, key implementation
challenges toward accurate and timely LPD diagnosis, and innovative diagnostic methods to overcome these
challenges."

Boston University School of Medicine’s new SEPA project, entitled ""Mystery of the Crooked Cell 2.0: CityLab’s
Next Generation Socioscientific Approach to Gene Editing,"" addresses the imperative that NIH's pre-college
activities focus on biomedical workforce preparedness, especially for underrepresented minorities (URM). This
project will reach close to 600 local URM students and, through planned dissemination, will reach thousands of
students. CityLab is partnering with five Boston-area high schools and two afterschool STEM/health professions
enrichment programs to test the effectiveness of embedding a focus on socioscientific reasoning (SSR) to
promote understanding of gene editing. An SSR approach places science content in a meaningful social context
and motivates students to take ownership of their learning. SSR skills include realizing the complexity of the
content and context of an issue, analyzing an issue from multiple perspectives, seeking out sources of bias in
data, and considering how and whether scientific investigations can advance understanding of an issue.
This project will expand CityLab’s “Mystery of the Crooked Cell” hands-on, inquiry-based curriculum supplement
that focuses on the molecular basis of sickle cell disease (SCD) by incorporating state-of-the-art gene editing
content that is suffused with SSR. The new curriculum supplement, Mystery of the Crooked Cell 2.0 (MCC 2.0),
will seamlessly integrate three elements: CityLab’s curriculum storyline and laboratory experiences, computer
simulations of molecular biology assays developed at University of Wisconsin-River Falls, and immersive virtual
reality simulations of gene editing for SCD therapies developed at UC Berkeley Innovative Genomics Institute.
SSR will be embedded throughout MCC 2.0, as will awareness of STEM/biomedical science careers. CityLab
will also build NextGen Scholars, a learning community that will not only engage students in advanced science
content and lab applications using SSR but also foster attitudes that support equity and diversity in STEM. This
project will demonstrate the feasibility and replicability of this pedagogical strategy; CityLab will then disseminate
the curriculum widely and thereby sow the seeds for a diverse and inclusive future STEM workforce.
The major objectives of the proposed project are: (1) to create MCC 2.0 in collaboration with high school teachers
and students, (2) to build a diverse community of learners who use SSR to explore advanced science topics
while gaining insights into the importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice in science, health, and
society, (3) to examine changes in students’ science content understanding, SSR skills, science learner identity,
and attitudes towards diversity in the biomedical sciences and medicine, (4) to track student participants through
college to understand the broader impact of this approach, and (5) to earn designation as one of the first “High-
Quality Design” high school lessons that are aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).
This new SEPA initiative is a unique way to pilot, refine, and disseminate a first-of-its-kind science education
program that will increase the diversity of the STEM/biomedical science workforce."
10917396,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is the leading known cause of mental retardation. Growing evidence
suggests a major contribution of the disruption of neural crest cell (NCC) and placode (PC) migration to ethanol-
induced craniofacial and cranial nerve defects. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how
ethanol disrupts the coordinated migration of NCCs and PCs in embryos. Exosomes have recently emerged as
an important mode of intercellular communication. Exosomes carry and transfer a variety of active molecules,
including microRNAs to and act on local and distant recipient cells, and affect their functions. We have recently
demonstrated that exosomes derived from human NCCs mediated ethanol-induced repression of SDF1/CXCR4
signaling and subsequently disrupted the coordinated migration of NCCs and PCs and that disruption of NCC
and PC migration contributes to ethanol-induced craniofacial and cranial nerve defects in zebrafish embryos.
The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which exosomes mediate ethanol-
induced repression of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling, disruption of the coordinated migration of NCCs and PCs, and
craniofacial and cranial nerve defects, and to establish plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles as a feasible
strategy for the prevention of FASD. The central hypothesis of this project is that ethanol disrupts the coordinated
migration of NCCs and PCs through NCC-derived exosome-mediated repression of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling,
subsequently leading to craniofacial and cranial nerve defects, and that modulation of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling
by grape exosome-like nanoparticles (GELNs) or GELNs loaded with miRNA modulators can prevent ethanol-
induced teratogenesis. To test our hypothesis, the following specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To
characterize the role of exosomes in ethanol-induced disruption of the coordinated migration of NCCs and PCs
in vitro and in zebrafish embryos. Aim 2: To elucidate the mechanisms by which NCC-derived exosomes mediate
ethanol-induced repression of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling and disruption of the coordinated migration of NCCs and
PCs. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that exosomes derived from NCCs mediate ethanol-induced craniofacial and
cranial nerve defects and that modulation of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling by GELNs or GELNs loaded with miRNA
modulators represents a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing FASD. The proposed work is innovative,
because this is the first study attempting to prevent FASD through the newly recognized role of exosomes in
intercellular communication and the actions of SDF1/CXCR4 signaling in modulating the coordinated migration
of NCCs and PCs. It also represents the first attempt to prevent FASD using edible plant-derived exosome-like
nanoparticles. The proposed research is expected to characterize a novel, exosome-mediated intercellular
interaction between NCCs and PCs during ethanol-induced teratogenesis. Such results will be significant,
because the insights gained from this study will help in elucidating the mechanisms underlying FASD and yield
exosome-based strategies for the prevention of FASD."
10917079,"Project Summary / Abstract
The Paulovich laboratory is a translational oncology lab specializing in proteomics with a goal to improve
personalized medicine through elucidating cancer mechanisms, diagnosing disease, and predicting response
to therapy. A major roadblock to achieving these goals is the lack of standardized assays for the quantification
of proteins, which form the basis of diagnostics and are targets for treatments. To address this need, our
research program is focusing on three arms: i) the development of novel applications of targeted mass
spectrometry for precise, multiplexed, and reproducible quantitation of proteins, ii) the standardization of
protein measurements through establishing community resources for the dissemination of the technology to
the biomedical research community, and iii) the measurement of proteins and post-translational modifications
in biological samples for fundamental biological insight to cancer mechanisms and translating findings to
clinical use. Dr. Jeffrey Whiteaker, a research specialist in the Paulovich laboratory, is vital to achieving
success in this interdisciplinary effort due to: his role as leader of all proteomics activities in the laboratory, his
vast experience in the field of analytical chemistry and mass spectrometry, and the guidance he provides
within the laboratory. He will continue to guide efforts aimed at expanding the technology to cancer-relevant
pathways and disseminating the technology to the biomedical research community, enabling the translation of
new discoveries to clinical care and the benefit of patients."
10916564,"Tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer and the leading preventable cause of death. Alcohol use is
responsible for ~88,000 deaths each year in the U.S. and is another primary preventable cause of cancer. The
changing cannabis policies and the 8% increase in cannabis use in the last decade have brought new
challenges for existing treatment efforts. Our recent studies among TTU college students indicate that over
50% of those who reported alcohol intoxication, tobacco use, or cannabis use in the past month were involved
in two or more of these substances (alcohol, tobacco and cannabis - ATC). Growing evidence has shown that
polysubstance use is associated with numerous and deleterious consequences for college-attending emerging
adults, but they are often unmotivated to quit or reduce drug use. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address
this critical public health issue of widespread polysubstance use in high risk college students. Despite multiple
treatment efforts, outcomes are far from optimal since treatments often fail to capitalize on important target
domains linked to addiction outcomes. Research shows that one target domain (mechanism) for ATC involves
deficits in self-control networks including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and
the ACC-Striatum circuit. Based on previous research conducted by our team and others, self-control deficits
have been linked to SUDs, and could be ameliorated through mindfulness meditation (MM) and/or EEG
neurofeedback (NF), both of which target self-control networks and have the potential to minimize negative
outcomes resulting from deficits in self-control. Although MM has shown promises in improving self- control
and reducing ATC use, many struggle to engage in the mindfulness practice early in treatment. Promisingly,
recent studies suggest that combining NF with MM may improve engagement with mindfulness practice and
produce larger reductions in ATC use compared to MM alone. The goal of this project is to understand brain
mechanisms of ATC reduction following brief IBMT, and optimize IBMT through EEG Neurofeedback (NF). We
will assess self-control deficits and ATC use and examine the effects of IBMT and/or NF on improving self-
control and reducing ATC use among TTU college students. Our study will be the first to reveal the brain
mechanisms of combining mindfulness intervention and EEG neurofeedback for treating polysubstance use,
and potentially provide preliminary evidence that the modulated self-control networks by IBMT+NF are
associated with clinical benefits such as craving and ATC reduction in high risk college students."
10916565,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ongoing epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD), overdose, and death is unprecedented. Available
pharmacologic therapies for OUD have failed to stem the tide, plagued by poor adherence and retention, the
principal factors associated with relapse and treatment failure. Over 80% of individuals with OUD are untreated.
More treatment options are needed. This proposal seeks to develop an OUD pharmacologic option superior to
currently available therapies. Agonist/ partial agonist treatments with methadone and buprenorphine currently
dominate pharmacologic therapies for OUD. However, antagonist therapy may be more appropriate for
important sub-populations: the young, newly addicted, military, select criminal justice clients, and patients whose
employment, beliefs, or preferences motivate abstinence. Once-monthly injectable extended-release naltrexone
(XRN) received FDA approval in 2010 for treating OUD. Due to improved patient adherence and retention
relative to oral once-daily naltrexone, XRN is gaining wider acceptance. US prescription volume has grown ~37%
in 2017. Still, early patient discontinuation with XRN is pervasive, as with other OUD treatments, often after just
1 month, usually leading to early relapse and treatment failure. We aim to maintain effective opioid antagonism
with a single injection lasting at least two months, and up to 4 months or more, improving upon the adherence,
retention, and treatment burden of comparable therapies. We have synthesized a series of novel and proprietary
small molecule ester-type prodrugs of FDA approved opioid antagonists, with established PK/PD correlations
and animal-human translatability. These candidates are designed to meet FDA’s abbreviated 505(b)2 approval
path, reducing development and regulatory risk. Broad provisional patent protection is filed. Our lead candidate,
NRS-033, shows in vivo calculated T1/2 of ~33 days in rats for the active metabolite. PK modelling suggest every
3 months or longer dosing is likely in humans. NRS-033’s mean plasma concentration of active metabolite at
28 days is 2.15 ng/ml, with ability to dose >50% higher, vs. XRN ~1.7 ng/ml, possibly allowing stronger
antagonism against potent synthetic opioids. For women who are pregnant and of child-bearing potential, we
expect more favorable pregnancy category B for NRS-033, rather than C as for all other MAT. Our UG3 aims
include: 1) lead confirmation studies, lead selection, FDA Fast Track Filing, and toxicology batch manufacturing;
2) IND-enabling studies, GMP manufacturing, and IND submission; UH3 aims are, 3) Phase 1 studies,
carcinogenicity studies, phase 2 clinical trial initiation, and FDA Breakthrough Therapy filing. The goal is to
urgently advance to phase 3 trials and FDA approval. We hypothesize we can develop a novel therapeutic with
superior adherence and retention, that may be better indicated in many women and stronger vs. synthetic
opioids. Despite atypically lower development risk, this timely advance should have a significant public health
impact by reducing rates of relapse, overdose, and death.

10916566,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research into effective strategies to reduce unintended pregnancy and short interval births, and to mitigate
associated adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes, has been hampered by poor conceptualization
and measurement of pregnancy intentions. Until recently, no validated psychometric measures had been
available to prospectively capture the range and complexity of feelings many women have about pregnancy,
including ambivalence and uncertainty. Reliance on simplistic measures and retrospective data have left
serious scientific gaps in our understanding of the causes, and health consequences, of unintended pregnancy
and short interpregnancy intervals (IPIs). Scholars have expressed an urgent need for improved measures and
longitudinal study designs, citing their importance to rigorous investigations of the role of pregnancy intentions
on the causal pathway to unintended pregnancy, short IPIs, and adverse health outcomes. This proposal
addresses these critical scientific and measurement gaps using longitudinal data from population-based
surveys, fielded to over 12,000 women, aged 18-44, across nine US states. These surveys include the Desire
to Avoid Pregnancy (DAP) scale, a novel instrument developed by our team using cutting-edge, rigorous
psychometric methods. The instrument reconceptualizes “intentions” as “preferences” and captures the
diversity of considerations and feelings women have about a potential future pregnancy. Using three years of
data, we will examine the predictive relationships between DAP scores, contraceptive use, incident pregnancy,
and birth outcomes. We will use structural equation models to investigate the extent to which DAP scores
mediate relationships between the personal and social contexts of women’s lives and pregnancy and birth
outcomes, addressing confounding that has hindered prior investigations. Critically, analyses will for the first
time apply prospective pregnancy preference data to investigate whether the elevated risk of negative maternal
and birth outcomes from short IPIs results from physiologic mechanisms, or the contexts in which these
frequently unintended pregnancies occur. We will then capitalize on the DAP’s strengths to develop novel
measurement tools that expand its utility. First, we will use item response theory (IRT) to develop a shorter
DAP version that maintains construct validity, facilitating the integration of rigorous, person-centered measures
into future research, surveillance, and clinical care. Then, we will use IRT to establish evidence-based
thresholds on the scale, defining standardized groupings of pre-pregnancy preferences (e.g., “undesired” or
“less preferred”), and addressing the urgent need for alternative measures to “unintended pregnancy” that
capture if women attain their reproductive preferences. A better understanding of how pregnancy preferences
are formed, and how unintended pregnancy contributes to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes – as well
as the contributions of our novel instruments to future science – can guide the field toward interventions that
can more successfully promote reproductive autonomy and improve maternal and child health."

developed the Kids First “Data Tracker” application as a key tool for collaboratively working with data
generators, analysts, investigators and NIH program staff for effective data coordination. The DCC will expand
the application based on the use cases around clinical data ingestion, AWS S3 storage management, status
reporting, workflow automation and dbGaP submissions. The data exchange endpoint between the DCC and
DRC will be a FHIR service and provide the ability for other interoperable data resources to integrate with Kids
First data. We will continue to improve on our genomic data best practices and expand the portfolio of pipelines
available for long-read sequencing, epigenomics and other data modalities as required for the Kids First
community. All bioinformatics pipeline development will leverage our experience building community-based
best practice workflows utilizing Common Workflow Language (CWL) and Docker so that they can be
reproducibly used by the community. Similarly, the DCC will continue to expand and improve on the
clinical/phenotypic data collection by building a standards-based curation toolkit that integrates with the Data
Tracker application. As the collection of Kids First variants scales to the level of tens of billions of variants, the
DCC will help support the community by building out easy to use workflows for variant filtering and incorporate
more expansive annotation that will allow researchers to more easily identify variants and clinical data of
further interest and investigation. The DCC will work hand in hand with the Kid First Administrative and

10917377,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE – SUMMARY
The proposed Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center is focused on the role of ferroptosis
in acquired resistance to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy is used to treat approximately 50% of cancer
patients and is standard of care treatment for lung cancer and esophageal cancer patients. The ARTI Center will
focus on these cancer types and comprise three research projects. Project 1 will focus on identifying the
mechanisms of ferroptosis in acquired resistance to radiation therapy and testing ferroptosis inducers (FINs) as
radiosensitizers. Project 2 will focus on determining whether hypoxia-induced resistance to ferroptosis
contributes to acquired tumor resistance to radiation therapy and whether FINs re-sensitize hypoxic tumor cells
to radiation treatment. Project 3 will focus on understanding the role of genomic and microenvironment factors
in acquired resistance to ferroptosis to chemoradiation in esophageal adenocarcinoma. The three research
projects will be supported by one shared Molecular Imaging Core (MIC), which will provide imaging tools and
analyses for measuring tumor growth, assessing the ability to overcome acquired radiation resistance using
combination therapies (e.g., FINs with radiation therapy or immunotherapy), identifying intratumoral hypoxic
regions, and evaluating myeloid cell expansion in conferring ferroptosis resistance to chemoradiation therapy.
To support the MIC and these three projects, the Administrative Core (AC) will be established as part of the
ARTI Center infrastructure that will support, coordinate, and facilitate all activities aimed at achieving and
evaluating milestones across the projects and core. The AC will establish and maintain engagement and
communication among ARTI Center and ARTNet members and program officials in Aim 1. In Aim 2, the AC will
facilitate ARTI Center evaluation, support the timely and quality development and submission of progress
reports, and maintain proper and transparent stewardship of funds. The AC will develop and implement an
internal solicitation and prioritization process for Pilot and Trans-Network Projects in Aim 3. In Aim 4, the AC
will serve as the central infrastructure to build a website and manage data, materials, resources, conflict
resolution, and issues of intellectual property for technologies and tools. The multiple Principal Investigators
(mPIs) of the ARTI Center, Boyi Gan, PhD and Albert Koong, MD, PhD, will serve as AC Co-Leaders. Under
their leadership, the AC will be able to leverage institutional and divisional resources; to establish and maintain
an ARTI Center Advisory Committee; to encourage the development of junior faculty, trainees, and students in
cancer research; to promote collaborations across ARTNet; and to ensure abidance by the ARTNet governance
and resource and data sharing policies. Overall, the AC will be the central juncture for the ARTI Center to
integrate with other ARTNet centers as well as other National Cancer Institute-funded programs and initiatives."
10917378,"Molecular Imaging Core Summary
The one shared resource core of the Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center is the
Molecular Imaging Core (MIC). The MIC is a build out of the Molecular Imaging Laboratory (MIL), a central
facility within the Department of Cancer Systems Imaging at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center that has received support from The Radiation Oncology and Cancer Imaging Program (ROCIP) under
the Cancer Center Grant (P30CA016672). For more than two decades, the MIL has been an expert hub for
preclinical imaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and bioluminescence imaging, and has
already established national and international collaborations and distributed key plasmids, cell lines, and reporter
animals to the global scientific community. The virtual MIC will support the central theme of the ARTI Center,
which is to determine whether ferroptosis plays a major role in acquired resistance to radiation therapy (RT). The
MIC will implement and manage the precise, preclinical imaging support infrastructure (personnel, reagents,
animals, software, and customized hardware resources) for the three research projects. The MIC will collaborate
with ARTI Center investigators in developing preclinical imaging protocols and analyses with appropriate
biological and biochemical controls, robust test-retest analysis, and imaging statistical support when appropriate
(Aim 1). In Aim 2, the MIC will provide timely access to unique plasmid-based reporters, reporter animals, PET
reagents, and fluorescent biosensors, while leveraging MIL and MD Anderson cores’ expertise to modify
reagents when appropriate to meet ARTI Center needs. Regarding workflow, the MIC will provide timely service,
training, access to customized macro- and microscopic imaging systems, premium image analytics, and custom
imaging analysis to ARTI Center investigators (Aim 3). For Project 1, the MIC will perform noninvasive
bioluminescence imaging in preclinical small animal models of lung and esophageal cancer to test the effects of
ferroptosis inducers (FINs) combined with RT as well as FINs combined with immunotherapy in overcoming
acquired tumor RT resistance. To help determine whether hypoxia modulates ferroptosis and acquired RT
resistance in Project 2, the MIC will perform bioluminescence imaging to monitor hypoxic tumor growth
resistance in response to RT and the potential radiosensitizing effects of FINs, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)
and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) inhibitors or knockdown, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy as well as
to identify hypoxic regions within tumors. With Project 3, the MIC will assess the role of myeloid cell expansion
in conferring ferroptosis resistance to chemoradiation therapy using preclinical tumor models derived from
esophageal adenocarcinoma patients and using a novel PET tracer developed by the MIC. The MIC will also
serve as a resource for not only ARTI Center investigators, but also for other Acquired Resistance to Therapy
Network (ARTNet) as well as for other National Cancer Institute-funded programs and initiatives."
10917380,"Project 1 Summary
Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is triggered by iron-dependent lipid
peroxidation. Previous studies by us and others identified ferroptosis as a critical tumor suppression
mechanism and suggested that inducing ferroptosis holds promise for cancer treatment. Recently, we and
others showed that radiotherapy (RT) can potently induce ferroptosis and identified ferroptosis inducers
(FINs) as radiosensitizers to tumors with intrinsic radioresistance (such as KEAP1 or p53 mutant tumors).
However, the mechanistic and therapeutic relevance of ferroptosis to acquired radioresistance remains
largely unexplored. Our long-term goals are to understand the mechanistic basis of ferroptosis in acquired
therapy resistance and to rationally target ferroptosis in acquired resistance and disease recurrence in
cancer treatment. The objectives of this application are to determine the mechanisms by which
ferroptosis resistance contributes to acquired radioresistance in thoracic cancers (including lung and
esophageal cancers), and to assess FINs as a therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired
radioresistance in these cancers. Our preliminary data support the central hypotheses that (i) ferroptosis
resistance represents a key mechanism underlying acquired radioresistance in lung and
esophageal cancers and (ii) combining FINs with immunotherapy is an effective therapeutic strategy to
overcome acquired radioresistance without causing significant damage to normal tissues. To test our
hypotheses, we will pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the mechanisms by
which ferroptosis resistance drives acquired radioresistance. Specific Aim 2. To determine the
effectiveness of combining FINs with RT in overcoming acquired tumor radioresistance. Specific Aim 3. To
determine the potential effects of FINs on radiation-induced toxicity in normal cells and tissues. It is
expected that our proposed studies will identify novel mechanisms of ferroptosis and acquired radioresistance
and identify effective new therapeutic strategies to overcome acquired radioresistance in thoracic
cancer treatment. Our proposal is highly innovative because it focuses on previously unexplored
pathways linking ferroptosis to acquired radioresistance. Our proposed studies will have a significant
impact on both our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of ferroptosis and therapy resistance
and our ability to target ferroptosis in acquired radioresistance in cancer treatment."
10917382,"Project 2 Summary
Tumor hypoxia, defined as low intratumoral oxygen tension, is common to most solid malignancies, including
lung and esophageal cancer. Lung and esophageal cancer treatments include radiation therapy (RT); however,
clinically, these cancers develop acquired resistance to RT. The mechanisms of acquired resistance to RT are
unknown but may involve a type of cell death called ferroptosis, which is the overarching theme of the proposed
Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. Project 2 will contribute to this overarching theme
by determining whether hypoxia drives ferroptosis resistance, thereby promoting the acquired resistance to RT.
Project 2 will utilize lung and esophageal cancer cell lines generated in Project 1 that are deficient in the
ferroptosis resistance-mediator Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11) and one of its transcription
factors: activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). The transcription of genes, including hypoxia-related genes, may
be dynamically regulated within tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment during chemoradiation
therapy (CRT) of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a focus of Project 3. In order to determine whether
oxygen is required for ferroptosis induction by RT, lung and esophageal cancer cells will be subjected to varying
oxygen concentrations and radiosensitivity, lipid peroxidation (i.e., driver of ferroptosis), and SLC7A11
expression will be measured (Aim 1). Aim 2 will focus on the delineation of the mechanisms of hypoxia-driven
ferroptosis resistance during acquired RT resistance by determining whether SLC7A11 expression is dependent
on ATF4 under hypoxic conditions during RT. Furthermore, as hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) have been shown
to promote radioresistance, the effect of hypoxia-induced HIF activation in acquired resistance to ferroptosis will
be investigated. To test the hypothesis that enhanced tumor oxygenation through hyperbaric oxygen treatment
(HBOT) as well as small molecule HIF and ATF4 inhibitors can overcome acquired radioresistance by enhancing
ferroptosis induction, lung tumor and esophageal tumor xenografts in mice will be treated with RT in combination
with HBOT or HIF/ATF4inhibitors(Aim 3). Tumor growth after RT will be monitored with weekly noninvasive
bioluminescence imaging at the Molecular Imaging Core (MIC). Furthermore, in the MIC, hypoxic regions within
tumors will be monitored in real-time by performing positron emission tomography (PET) using the PET tracer
18F-Fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA). Overall, the differential regulation of ferroptosis and acquired RT
resistance by poorly oxygenated and well oxygenated areas in tumors discovered in Project 2 will iteratively
strengthen and support the basic science/mechanistic Project 1 and the preclinical/translational Project 3 by
helping identify tumor regions that may develop acquired resistance to RT that could aid in patient selection for
subsequent treatments."
10917384,"Project 3 Summary
Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of deaths worldwide with a 5-year survival rate of less than
20%. Similar to other intrathoracic malignancies, such as lung cancer, chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is an
effective tool for treating esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, CRT leads to complete responses in
EAC in only approximately 25% of patients. Thus, characterizing the cellular and molecular changes that occur
in the tumor and tumor microenvironment during CRT can provide highly accurate predictive tools to identify
which EAC patients will develop acquired resistance to therapy. CRT induces the cell death pathway ferroptosis
in cancer cells, and the hypothesis that ferroptosis is a key regulator in acquired radiation therapy resistance is
a central theme of the Acquired Resistance to Therapy and Iron (ARTI) Center. Project 3 will contribute to
this central theme by bridging the basic science mechanisms in preclinical models discovered in Project 1 and
Project 2 with clinical EAC tumor biopsies, collected at baseline (before treatment) and during the middle of the
CRT regimen. These EAC tumor biopsies will undergo single cell transcriptome profiling to identify expression
of ferroptosis-related genes and to provide an understanding of the complex communications between tumor
cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment that may drive and/or regulate ferroptosis (Aim 1). Identification
of transcriptomes that are directly or indirectly related to ferroptosis may help to prognose EAC patients who
may or may not respond to CRT. Further spatial cellular mapping and deciphering the relationship of differentially
expressed genes with ferroptosis will provide evidence for the tumor’s ability to evade ferroptosis upon
irradiation. Aim 2 will focus on determining whether adaptive resistance to therapy occurs due to selection of
rare, but pre-existing tumor cells, or due to de novo acquisition of alterations in genes directly or indirectly related
to ferroptosis signaling pathways. Aim 3 will focus on elucidating the tumor microenvironment mechanisms that
may confer ferroptosis resistance to CRT, such as fibroblasts, which have been shown to regulate the cystine
transporter SCL7A11 that promotes ferroptosis resistance. In addition, tumor-infiltrated immune cells with
hypoxic signatures will be analyzed for their association with ferroptosis resistance to CRT. In EAC tumors
resistant to CRT, myeloid cell expansion was observed, and the phenotype and activation status of myeloid cells
will be assessed using orthotopically transplanted patient derived EAC tumors. Further application of an
innovative positron emission tomography tracer from the Molecular Imaging Core of the ARTI Center to assess
oxidative potential of tumors as related to the myeloid cell expansion observed in resistant tumors will help
discover molecular and cellular pathways related to ferroptosis. Project 3 will iteratively strengthen and support
the basic science/mechanistic Projects 1 and 2, and Project 3 will significantly contribute to the ARTI Center goal
of identifying patients who are at greatest risk to develop acquired radiation resistance."
10917388,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We were one of two groups to first identify amino acid substitutions on histone H3 variants (oncohistones) in
human disease. In the past funding cycle, we showed that, beyond their initial identification in specific subtypes
of high-grade gliomas and bone tumors, these oncohistones also occur in subgroups of sarcomas, head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas, and acute myeloid leukemias. Working with members of this Program Project,
we showed how H3K27M and H3K36M (K-to-M substitutions) lead to stalled development and blocked
differentiation through epigenome rewiring as they promote aberrant spreading/redistribution of key chromatin
marks from their initial boundaries, which in turn facilitate oncogenesis. Furthermore, our collaboration with
Lewis/Garcia labs uncovered that, EZHIP, a testis-specific protein aberrantly expressed in posterior fossa group
A ependymomas, biochemically mirrors H3K27M oncohistone. Our preliminary data indicate that EZHIP is also
aberrantly activated in subgroups of osteosarcomas. In contrast to the growing information on K-to-M mutations,
however, there is limited knowledge on the oncogenic function, molecular mechanisms and tumor-specific
vulnerabilities of the oncohistone-mimic EZHIP and mutations affect H3.3G34. In large part, this is due to a
paucity of resources and models that faithfully recapitulate the cellular effects mediated by these alterations.
Therefore, a major goal of this project is to develop and employ novel patient sample-, cell culture- and animal
model-based systems to model oncohistone-associated cancers and investigate the underlying pathogenic
mechanisms. Nearly all G34 mutations affect histone variant H3.3, and while H3.3G34R/V are frequently found
in pediatric gliomas, giant cell tumors are predominantly defined by H3.3G34W mutations. This dichotomy is
reflected by the distinct phenotypes of the H3f3a G34W, R or V knock-in mouse models we have developed. We
aim to delineate the mechanisms behind the codon-specific phenotypes resulting from H3.3G34 mutations, the
role of specific mutational partnership for G34R/V-driven tumorigenesis, and the necessity of H3.3 variant in
mediating G34-dependent phenotypes (Aim 1). We will investigate the role of EZHIP in development, how its
aberrant expression is achieved and promotes oncogenesis in osteosarcomas and ependymomas - comparing
and contrasting to H3K27M mutation (Aim 2). Lastly, we will build on our findings of the viral mimicry induced by
K-to-M mutations to assess the degree and nature of immune infiltration in these tumors at baseline and upon
treatment of epigenetic drugs (Aim 3). Notably, these studies are enabled by the unique syngeneic mouse
models and CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic patient-derived tumor cell lines we have generated for various
oncohistones and EZHIP. This project will synergize with other efforts of this Program Project to provide
mechanistic insights and relevant and reliable pre-clinical models to the community, building a knowledge and
resource base upon which targets amenable to therapy that can be conceived and validated."
10917390,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ALLIS)
Genome-wide sequencing technologies have allowed an unprecedented discovery of somatic mutations in
chromatin and epigenetic modifiers in human cancers, providing mechanistic links between cancer epigenomes
and genetic alterations. The collective number of oncogenic mutations in epigenetic regulators has led to the
emerging view of “driver mutations” underlying cancer epigenomes. Nowhere is this better illustrated than with
the now classical findings of high-frequency (50-95%) missense mutations in core histones, such as histone H3
lysine 27 to methionine (H3K27M) mutation in pediatric gliomas, and H3 lysine 36 to methionine (H3K36M)
mutations in chondroblastomas and undifferentiated sarcomas. During the prior grant period, we have shown
that these mutations directly prevent the ‘writing’ of some critical regulatory histone post-translational
modifications (PTMs) to promote oncogenesis through altered chromatin organization, transcription, and in some
cases cell fate and differentiation. More recently, we have extended our understanding of the landscape of
histone mutations in cancers. We characterized an unexpectedly broad landscape of novel oncohistone
mutations that occur in roughly 4% of all cancers. These mutations are found not only in the H3 N-terminal tail,
which is the site of classical oncohistones, but also in the globular domain and in all four core histones. Our
preliminary data suggest that a least a subset of these mutations affect one or more properties of chromatin and
chromatin-dependent processes including nucleosome stability, histone PTMs, and cellular differentiation. We
therefore hypothesize that novel oncohistone mutations will impact the landscape of histone PTMs and chromatin
organization in a context dependent manner, leading to dysregulation of gene expression and effects on cell fate
and tumorigenesis. The goal of this work is to rigorously test these hypotheses for a comprehensive set of
cancer-associated histone mutations using a multidisciplinary approach that include genetics (barcoded
oncohistone libraries, mouse models, barcoded-cell lines), epigenetics (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNA-methylation
profiling), transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and chemical biology (“designer chromatin”, small molecule inhibitors).
Specifically, we will 1) define molecular mechanisms by which novel oncohistones act and their impact on
chromatin and gene expression; 2) determine how these molecular changes translate into phenotypes using
cellular differentiation and tumor allograft models, and explore pharmacologic strategies to rescue differentiation
blockade; and 3) extend our studies into animal models and diverse cellular contexts to test the roles of novel
oncohistones in tumorigenesis and development. Together, these approaches will shed light on the function of
newly discovered oncohistones and provide important insight into the role of histones and chromatin structure in
tumorigenesis. Our findings are expected to pave new avenues towards intervening pharmacologically the
aberrant epigenetic pathways for cancer therapeutics. To facilitate the success of this proposal, a world-class
team of investigators, experts in cancer, chromatin and chemical biology, have been assembled."

10918179,"OUTREACH CORE – ABSTRACT
Cancer incidence and mortality rates for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved and vulnerable
populations are substantially higher in Chicago than the national average for most cancers (Illinois State Cancer
Registry). Addressing these disparities demands culturally and linguistically relevant community-driven
approaches. In 2015, a consortium comprised of community members and three major academic institutions in
Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert H. Lurie
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC), secured NCI U54 funding to establish the
Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC), which aims to foster rigorous and meaningful
research, education, training, and community outreach/engagement to advance health equity. Through the
original U54 award, the Outreach Core identified community needs, and provided leadership and programmatic
support for community-based cancer education, engagement, and outreach activities. In this renewal, the
proposed activities of the ChicagoCHEC Outreach Core will build upon the existing strengths, prior and ongoing
work, accomplishments, and lessons learned from the first U54 award to elevate ChicagoCHEC’s collective
impact on reducing cancer inequities. A major area of the Outreach Core’s focus for the next five years will be
to develop targeted cancer support efforts for underserved and vulnerable populations. These include the
following non-mutually exclusive groups: people with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, men of color, and
low-income cancer survivors. Proposed community engagement approaches span the cancer continuum,
encompassing prevention, screening and early detection, community-based education, and cancer treatment
and survivorship. Specific aims of the Outreach Core are to: (1) Foster community partnerships and conduct
ongoing needs assessment to identify new and innovative areas of opportunity, including outreach research, for
community-engaged activities that will reach individuals from health disparities populations; (2) Implement
outreach and education activities across the cancer continuum; (3) Foster opportunities for building cancer health
equity research capacity among community partners, faculty, and students; (4) Plan, implement, and evaluate
NCI National Outreach Network activities locally; and (5) Rigorously evaluate achievement and progress of the
Outreach Core’s stated aims using a comprehensive evaluation strategy. A highly effective and diverse tri-
institutional leadership team with complementary expertise will lead these activities, supported by experienced
Community Health Educators with strong clinical and community networks. A Community Steering Committee
will guide the development and implementation of the proposed outreach and engagement activities. The
Outreach Core will leverage each ChicagoCHEC partner academic institution’s numerous ties to Chicago’s
diverse neighborhoods and community organizations in its activities collectively aimed at advancing cancer
health equity."
10922754,"EMPOWER: Enacting Materials to Promote OWnership, Engagement and Relevance
EMPOWER (Enacting Materials to Promote OWnership, Engagement and Relevance) is an ambitious
program that empowers students to enact change in their local community. The introduction of the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) across the United States has spurred numerous efforts to
design and disseminate NGSS-aligned curriculum materials. NGSS-aligned curriculum materials aim to
shift science instruction away from rote memorization and toward the active co-construction of ideas by
teachers and students. However, these curriculum materials often do not address the persistent, and
problematic relationships between race, class, and health and environmental factors that minoritized
students of color face in their communities. The goal of the EMPOWER program is to prepare teachers
to adapt and enact curriculum materials to address and respond to issues of sociopolitical relevance, so
that students will be engaged, interested, and empowered to enact change in their local community.
 In the EMPOWER program, we will work with a cohort of teachers (~40) in 3 core partner school
districts who have committed to using NGSS-aligned units as part of their middle school science
curriculum. Our theory of action is that supporting teachers’ understanding of their students, their local
teaching contexts, and the curriculum materials will result in shifts in 1) teachers’ views of effective
science teaching, 2) teachers’ capacity to adapt curriculum materials to address local issues, and 3)
students’ sense of ownership and engagement in science learning. These shifts are mediated by 2
years of professional learning (PL) activities across two contexts: participation in 1) week-long summer
workshops, and 2) ongoing cycles of enactment and reflection during the academic year. In the
summer workshops, teachers will investigate the environmental and health issues in students’ local
community and use this knowledge to adapt the curriculum to directly connect science learning to these
issues. During the academic year, teachers will engage in multiple cycles of enactment and reflection
on the adapted lesson with researchers and their district colleagues. Across these two contexts,
artifacts, surveys and video recordings will be used to study shifts in teacher’s beliefs and adaptive
expertise with curriculum materials, as well as students’ participation in science learning. In Year 3, we
will work with a subset of teachers in each cohort (~20) to co-develop an open source video case
library of curricular adaptations that promote students’ ownership, engagement, and participation. The
research activities of the EMPOWER program will result in the development of an open source video
case library that documents how curriculum enactments empower students to address human and
environmental health issues in their community."
10917810,"SUMMARY
 Aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD),
are associated with alterations in nuclear structure, chromatin dysregulation, genome instability, and
transcriptome changes. Chromatin associated RNAs (caRNAs), like long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and
nascent RNAs, are intimately associated with the regulation and maintenance of genome organization and
transcription. Restoration of normal nuclear and chromatin structure can increase longevity and mitigate disease
markers, highlighting the potential of further research into mechanisms that regulate these processes to advance
the treatment of AD/ADRD and aging related pathologies. caRNAs likely play important precursor roles in age-
related changes to nuclear and chromatin structure, but no high-throughput methods exist to characterize
caRNAs including lncRNAs, nascent mRNAs, and other nuclear RNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation and
sequencing (RIP-seq) methods currently used to study target-associated RNAs require large inputs and are
impractical for studying these nuclear RNAs, which are often cell type specific, restricted to specific nuclear
compartments, and/or short-lived. Thus, new high-performance genomic technologies that can be leveraged to
study caRNAs are necessary to enable the next generation of research for aging and age-related diseases,
including identification of novel biomarkers and accelerated therapeutic development.
 Here, EpiCypher is partnering with Dr. Kami Ahmad (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) to develop
Reverse Transcribe & Tagmentation (RT&Tag™), a new approach to identify caRNAs including nascent RNA
transcripts at targeted features to accelerate aging and AD/ADRD research. The central innovation of this project
is using an immunotethering-based approach for in situ targeted tagmentation of caRNAs. We are also
developing novel spike-in controls for assay optimization and technical performance monitoring. Furthermore,
these spike-ins will enable standardized data normalization and cross experiment comparisons, methods not
always available or used in other RNA profiling methods. In Phase I equivalent studies, we successfully
developed RT&Tag and applied it to identify histone PTM-associated polyadenylated (polyA) RNAs in multiple
cell types. We demonstrated that RT&Tag is highly robust, requiring far less input material (500x fewer cells)
and sequencing depth (6x fewer reads) than RIP-seq. In Phase II, we will design novel RNA-associated dNuc
controls (RNA-dNucs) that are compatible with RT&Tag and apply them to perform rigorous optimization of
RT&Tag for analysis of polyA caRNAs (Aim 1). Next, we will extend RT&Tag application by optimizing a workflow
to capture nascent and non-polyA transcripts (Aim 2). Following, we will integrate data analysis pipelines for
aligning RNA reads in a user-friendly bioinformatics portal and prepare for commercial launch of RT&Tag (Aim
3). Market availability of RT&Tag kits and services will transform the study of aging and AD/ADRD by providing
a key tool to elucidate the link between caRNAs, epigenetic dysregulation, and aberrant gene expression."
10923485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Bacteria encode a diverse array of molecular systems to defend against infecting phages. In response,
phages have devised many counter-defense strategies to overcome this immunity and re-establish infection.
Mounting evidence suggests that most bacterial defense systems and phage counter-defenses in nature have
not been identified. This is a major knowledge gap because the interplay between these systems often
determines whether a phage successfully infects its bacterial host. These phage infections, in turn, have major
impacts on the evolution and treatment of infectious disease. For instance, pathogenesis in bacteria often
evolves due to the integration of a prophage that expresses a toxin or other virulence factor. At the same time,
phages are increasingly viewed as potential therapeutics to treat bacterial infections, especially in cases where
multi-drug resistance renders conventional treatments unsuccessful. Thus, it is important to better understand
the natural diversity of bacterial defense and phage counter-defense systems. To meet this need, we will devise
new high-throughput functional selections to find defense and counter-defense systems in microbial ecosystems
and in libraries of synthesized phage open reading frames. This functional approach does not rely on sequence
similarity to predict defense and counter-defense systems, so overcomes the limitations of conventional,
homology-based discovery methods. This strategy, therefore, is expected to identify many new defense and
counter-defense genes beyond what is known currently. It is especially valuable for examining functions encoded
in phage genomes and bacterial genomic islands, as most genes from these sources are of unknown function.
Since nearly all bacteria should encode anti-phage defense systems, and almost all phages will encode counter-
defense strategies, we expect to make many new discoveries. Because these discoveries are predicted to be
novel, we will use a combination of genetic and functional assays to describe their mechanisms of action. We
will use Escherichia coli as a host for our functional selections, not only because this will allow us to construct
large functional libraries, but also because virulence in this pathogen is driven by prophage-expressed toxins
and because its phages are among those used most commonly to develop phage therapies. Thus, our findings
will not only be broadly relevant to pathogenesis and phage therapy across bacteria, but also will yield these
insights specifically in the context of this important human pathogen."

The standard approach to TB control relies on detection and treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
disease. This approach may have limited effectiveness in areas where the high burden of TB leads to high
levels of transmission. To curb the TB epidemic, new cases must be prevented. Preventive therapy is an
effective intervention as it reduces the risk of progression to disease by 65 – 85% in both HIV-positive (HIV+)
and negative (HIV-) individuals. A monumental challenge still remains: one-quarter of the world's population is
infected with Mtb. Treating all individuals with LTBI is not feasible: a strategy to identify those at highest risk for
progression to TB is required. Contacts who are newly infected experience a period of high risk for progressive
disease that lasts about 2 to 3 yrs. Our recent cohort study in urban Uganda measured the annual rate of Mtb
infection in the community as close to 10%/yr. For most individuals with latent Mtb infection (LTBI), the timing
of infection is unknown and biomarkers of recent infection would help identify persons at greatest risk for
disease progression. A proteomic analysis of serum from TB household contacts who converted their
tuberculin skin test (TST) identified a protein signature for new Mtb infection. Improving upon this signature and
determining its use in the community to identify persons who recently developed LTBI would allow for targeted
preventive therapy and “halt Mtb transmission”. The overall hypothesis for this proposal is that serum/plasma
biomarker signatures of new Mtb infection can identify HIV+ and HIV- adults in high Mtb transmission areas
and targeting these individuals for preventive therapy will reduce TB and Mtb transmission in the community.
There are 3 aims. Aim 1 will test and enhance a host protein signature as biomarker for new Mtb infection in
HIV-infected and non-infected persons. We will use plasma collected in an ongoing TB household contact
study in Kampala, Uganda in which TST-/IGRA- HIV+ and HIV- adults are enrolled and followed for IGRA/TST
conversion. We will determine if serum cytokines enhance the predictive accuracy of this protein signature.
Aim 2 will identify new Mtb infection in high risk environments in an urban African setting. GPS tracking
technology will be used to trace and longitudinally map subjects to locate areas of high Mtb transmission, i.e.
“hot-spots”. Subjects will be enrolled and followed for IGRA/TST conversion every 3 months over 1 yr with
serial sampling of plasma. Aim 3 will determine if the protein signature(s) developed in Aim 1 can identify new
Mtb infections in the community. This project builds on more than 20 years of experience by this investigative
team studying Mtb transmission in TB households and community in Kampala, Uganda, and host responses to
Mtb infection and disease in HIV+ and HIV- persons. This proposal brings together expertise in Mtb
epidemiology (Drs. Whalen, Kiwanuka, Joloba, Stein), immunology (Drs. Mayanja, Boom) and biomarker
development (Drs. Bark, Paramithiotis) at CWRU, Makerere University, University of Georgia, and Caprion Inc."

Adoptive  Cell  Immunotherapy  using  patient  harvested  T  cells  engineered  against  tumor-­specific  targets  has

10914848,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based machine that segregates chromosomes into two new
daughter cells when cells divide. Accurate spindle function is critical: mistakes lead to extra or missing
chromosomes, which are associated with cancer, birth defects, and miscarriage. Spindle function requires
robust coupling of biochemistry and mechanics. Yet, understanding how this self-organizing machine
generates the required forces in the right place at the right time remains a challenge. Our long term goal is to
determine how micron-scale mechanical properties of the spindle emerge from molecular-scale biochemistry.
We focus on microtubule bundles, which provide organization and underpin rigidity in the spindle and in other
microtubule-based structures. We do not understand what material properties bundling molecules impart to
spindle bundles, how their molecular properties allow them to do so, or how these emergent mechanical
properties are tuned for biological functions. To address these questions, we will measure quantitative
readouts of how bundles respond to perturbations that alter mechanics. We take a multi-system approach to
understanding bundle mechanics in mammalian kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), which attach and segregate
chromosomes; in fission yeast S. pombe spindles, whose stereotyped organization facilitates probing how
specific crosslinker properties affect bundles overall; and in vitro, where we have more precise control.
 Our approach is organized into two programs: (1) probing the molecular and mechanical organization of
spindle microtubule bundles, and (2) controlling spindle microtubule bundles to alter function through novel
mechanics. In Program 1, we will determine how k-fiber organization balances competing mechanical
constraints of robust force-transmission for chromosome segregation with flexibility to adapt to changing
spindle morphology. We will also develop new tools to measure force between microtubules within spindle
bundles, determining how these bundles effectively transmit force to achieve their mechanical functions. In
Program 2, we will determine how the geometric and mechanical properties of microtubule crosslinkers impart
bundle-scale properties that are adapted to particular functions. We will create engineered crosslinkers whose
mechanical and geometric properties we will control, and use them to build reconstituted microtubule bundles
in vitro, and to alter bundle properties in vivo. By measuring the response of these bundles to molecular-scale
changes, we will determine how micron-scale properties emerge.
 In sum, the proposed work will map how molecular scale parts impart spindle bundles with properties
that balance competing mechanical constraints. In the long term, this approach may lead to new insight into
how altering the cell’s “building code” can be harnessed to target microtubule architectures with key roles in
disease, or to build novel architectures. This approach can extend to understand the emergent mechanics of
microtubule bundle architectures beyond the spindle, such as in cilia and axons."
10914858,"This proposal will disseminate FlyWire, a Drosophila whole brain connectomics resource. We
used advances in AI to segment all neurons from a whole brain EM volume called FAFB. The
automated segmentation is of high enough quality that, in combination with innovative
proofreading tools, scientists can relatively quickly proofread circuits of interest. The community
of current collaborators includes about 160 scientists from 40 labs, who have so far succeeded
at proofreading more than 15% of the neurons in the fly brain. Several publications have
resulted, and more are on the way. Proofreading is required because automated segmentation,
while good, contains errors that must be fixed with manual correction. Janelia/HHMI spent 50
person-years proofreading an EM volume that contains roughly one-third of the neurons in
another female brain, a resource called the hemibrain. A whole brain connectome, in contrast,
will make it possible to address questions about brain-wide circuit organization and about any
brain region. We created this unique resource with a three-year grant from the BRAIN Initiative,
and are now seeking additional funding to disseminate the resource more widely. Our
framework for dissemination will set the standard for emerging, larger connectomics datasets,
such as those of mammals. We propose three Aims for dissemination that include outreach
efforts, deploying a centrally-managed proofreading team, and enhancing the user interface and
tools available to access FlyWire data. In particular, a Community Manager will organize the
community of scientists working in FlyWire, will recruit and train new users, will run workshops,
and will coordinate access to the trained proofreaders. Scientists can apply to have an expert
proofreader assist with their circuit reconstruction projects, and we will give priority to new users.
Finally, in the first year of the project we will implement GUI tools in FlyWire that facilitate
discovery without necessitating programming skills."
10914863,"The vast majority of ovarian cancer patients die from metastatic disease due to lack of effective
treatments. To more successfully treat these women, we urgently need to better understand the
molecular mechanisms of ovarian cancer metastasis. Up to 70% of ovarian cancers are high-grade
serous carcinomas (HGSC). These cancers most commonly initiate from secretory epithelial cells in the
fallopian tube (FT) and are highly metastatic. Genetic alterations, including BRCA and p53 mutations,
facilitate the transformation of FT cells into serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas as the precursor
lesions of HGSCs. Cells then spread throughout the peritoneal cavity even before the clinically
manifested “primary” ovarian tumors are detected, thus only 15% of patients are diagnosed with more-
curable stage I disease. Very little is known about the molecular and cellular process driving the
formation of disseminated intraperitoneal tumors. Our Ovgp1-iCreER BPRN mouse model recapitulates
the development of precursor lesions from oviduct (equivalent of human FT) and forms metastatic
HGSC, allowing us to explore the process of metastatic tumor development in HGSC. We carried out
single-cell RNA-sequencing of oviducts and tumors from the BPRN mice and identified a population of
tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with an increased ability to produce tumor organoids in vitro and form
metastases in vivo. We validated their presence in human HGSC samples and found their gene
signature to be enriched in 40% of HGSC patient samples in TCGA dataset and associated with poor
prognosis. Using single-cell regulatory networks analysis, we determined that the nuclear receptor
subfamily 2 group F member 2 (NR2F2) pathway was activated in these TICs. On the basis of our
preliminary data and prior research, we hypothesize that NR2F2 pathway is critical for the FT-originated
TICs to drive metastasis in HGSC. We propose three aims to test our hypothesis: 1) Define the
molecular mechanism by which NR2F2 regulates migration and adhesion of ovarian cancer cells; 2)
Characterize the expression and activation pattern of NR2F2 at different stages of tumor development in
the BPRN mouse model. 3) Determine the biological and mechanistic effects of NR2F2 inhibition on
metastasis of HGSC. The proposed study will provide novel insights into mechanisms of HGSC
metastasis and inform the development of new strategies for inhibiting metastasis and prevent their
recurrence in women with HGSC."
10915051,"Project Summary
 Our ability to visually interpret the world around us depends on rapid bottom-up computations that
extract relevant information from the sensory inputs, but it also depends on our accumulated core knowledge
about the world providing top-down signals based on prior experience. The goal of this proposal is to study the
mechanisms by which visual information is integrated spatially and temporally to combine bottom-up and top-
down knowledge. Towards this goal, we combine behavioral measurements, invasive neurophysiological
recordings, invasive electrical stimulation, and computational models. We focus on the ubiquitous challenge of
visual search, exemplified by searching for your phone using exclusively visual cues. The behavioral data will
provide critical constraints about human integrative abilities, particularly through eye movements and the
dynamics of recognition and object location. The invasive neurophysiological data will provide high
spatiotemporal resolution of neural activity along the inferior temporal cortex and the interactions with the pre-
frontal cortex, which are hypothesized to be critical for conveying the type of top-down signals required for
recognition and attention modulation during visual search. Ultimately, a central goal of our proposal is to
formalize our understanding of these integrative processes via a quantitative computational model. This
computational model should be able to capture the behavioral and physiological results and provide testable
predictions. During the current award, we have made progress towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying
pattern completion used by the visual system to infer the identity of objects from partial information, the effects
of contextual information during object recognition, and computational models of visual search. We have strong
preliminary evidence that suggests that state-of-the-art purely bottom-up theories of recognition instantiated by
deep convolutional networks cannot explain human behavior and physiology. Therefore, the proposed work
aims to establish a strong computational, behavioral and physiological framework that merges bottom-up and
top-down processing. Furthermore, we will move beyond correlative measures by using electrical stimulation to

implications for many neurological and psychiatric conditions that are characterized by dysfunctional top-down
signaling and remain poorly understood."
10915384,"The mission of the Congenital and Perinatal Infections Consortium (CPIC) is to eliminate the disease burden
associated with rare pediatric viral diseases, focusing on congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, neonatal
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and neonatal enterovirus (EV) and parechovirus (HPeV) sepsis, by
gathering multi-site data to improve diagnosis, clinical trial readiness, and treatment of these rare diseases.
The proposed CPIC administrative structure builds on the infrastructure, as well as the success, of our well-
established Collaborative Antiviral Study Group (CASG).
The CPIC Administrative Core will provide oversight, coordination, and logistical support for the operation of
the proposed Consortium. The specific aims of the Core are to: 1) allocate and manage personnel and the
financial accounts related to CPIC activities, and provide fiscal oversight of all cores and projects; 2) develop
and implement policies and procedures to be used by CPIC sites related to research projects and CPIC Cores;
3) oversee and monitor all internal communication between CPIC sites and external communication with the
Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC); and
4) evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the overall CPIC, its research projects, and its cores.
We have carefully selected a coalition of 28 sites that individually and collectively bring knowledge of our
disease areas, experience collaborating on the development and implementation of research protocols, and
close partnerships with their patient populations. All have worked closely together for at least the past 10
years, and in many cases for up to 30 years. Throughout that time, UAB has provided scientific, regulatory,
trial management, biostatistical, laboratory, and data management support for all studies. This collaboration
has resulted in long-standing relationships, refinement of research and communication processes, and a
collective understanding of knowledge gaps among sites. Our team will be led by David Kimberlin, MD, CPIC
Principal Investigator (PI). He will be assisted by a Program Director and a Fiscal Manager within the UAB
Central Unit to ensure timely completion of all day-to-day administrative details, including regulatory
coordination and budgetary matters. The CPIC Administrative Core will utilize an Executive Committee that
includes participation from three partner leads, as well as a representative from the National CMV Foundation,
which is the CPIC Stakeholder Group. It will oversee research projects, Core Leadership, and will receive
advice from an External Advisory Committee."
10914981,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Pediatric Immuno-oncology and Immunotherapy T32 training program is designed to train postdoctoral
fellows with the interdisciplinary skills and knowledge that are necessary to become highly productive scientists
in this field. Immunotherapy for pediatric cancer patients has the potential to revolutionize how we take care of
pediatric cancer patients and holds the promise to provide cures for currently ‘incurable pediatric cancers’. The
high specificity of such immunotherapies should reduce toxicity and long-term adverse effects. However, the
success of this therapeutic approach will depend on our ability to attract promising young investigators into the
field. Despite obvious differences between adult and pediatric cancer, there is currently no pediatric immuno-
oncology T32 training program funded by the NIH, and our proposed training program fills this gap. There is an
urgent need for discovery-based research, in particular to define the immune landscape of pediatric cancer, and
to strengthen research focused on translating immunotherapeutic approaches into early phase clinical studies.
This can only be accomplished by providing systematic, rigorous training in pediatric immuno-oncology and
immunotherapy, and this T32 training program meets this need. We are requesting three postdoctoral positions
to support interdisciplinary training in immuno-oncology and immunotherapy within our institution. Pediatric
immuno-oncology and immunotherapy is a very broad topic, and the training has been designed to expose
trainees to the most important topics, while also providing tailored preparation for a career in pediatric immuno-
oncology-related research. Training will be a combination of basic science concepts and techniques, translational
research, animal studies, and professional development, including scientific writing and grant preparation.
Trainees will present their work annually as part of the T32 program’s Training Day, which will be held in
conjunction with an on-site visit from our External Advisory Committee (EAC). It will comprise research
presentations by trainees to program faculty and the EAC, a featured lecture from an EAC member, and
evaluation of the program by the EAC. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital provides an ideal environment for
the proposed T32, with cutting edge technologies, numerous core facilities including an onsite Good
Manufacturing Practice facility, and dedicated faculty who are committed to training young scientists. Moreover,
it is the home of the only NCI comprehensive cancer center that is solely focused on pediatric cancer. Importantly,
it is committed to developing the next generation of pediatric immunotherapies through its strategic plan and
multi-investigator initiatives. St. Jude provides a rich intellectual environment with formal and informal interaction
between laboratories and research programs in multiple institutional lecture and seminar series, providing ample
opportunities to trainees for additional research training and career development. In summary, we are committed
to training the next generation of scientists in the field of pediatric immuno-oncology and immunotherapy, which
holds the promise to cure pediatric cancers with minimal treatment-related harm."
10915205,"ABSTRACT
Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) affects approximately 11% of all births and is a significant contributor to
neonatal mortalities and morbidities. Current interventions in PTB are designed to stop maternal uterine
contractions to delay delivery but have limited success. Infection and host inflammatory responses are the
major factors predisposing to PTB. Inflammation of the feto-maternal interface (FMi), specifically at the chorio-
decidual interface, in response to various risk factors can compromise immune tolerance that maintains
pregnancy, amplify inflammatory response, and trigger pathways of PTB. Multiple drugs in preclinical trials
have shown that they can reduce inflammation and delay PTB. However, challenges in testing drug transport,
metabolic changes, and teratogenicity have hindered PTB drug development. Unfortunately, current in vitro cell
culture models and animal models have several limitations, and focus is given only to placental transport of
drugs. To overcome these limitations, we have been successfully developing several tissue chip models of the
FMi using primary human cells and have demonstrated that they can recapitulate the functions and responses
of healthy and disease states of the FMis. However, our tissue chip models lack high-throughput screening
(HTS) capabilities. This proposal will develop a high-throughput 3D bioprinted FMi tissue chip in a 96-well
format, which can be used for HTS of large drug libraries, while keeping the key advantages of FMi tissue
chips in mimicking in utero structure and functions. We will specifically focus on the chorio-decidua interface,
motivated by two recent findings: 1) drug transport efficiently occurs through the chorio-decidual interface (FMi)
like that seen in placenta, where previously it was thought that most transport occurs exclusively through
placenta and 2) efficacy of Pravastatin (drug tested here) transported through this FMi is substantially higher
than through placenta in reducing inflammation. In the UH2 phase, the healthy and disease (infection and
inflammation-driven PTB) tissue chip model will be developed together with NCATS' intramural investigators,
combining our expertise of PTB, FMi cells, tissue chip development, cell/ECM bioprinting, and high-throughput
drug screening. In the UH3 phase, we will utilize the tissue chip to screen up to 1,000 drug compounds at
NCATS, followed by further analysis of selected drugs of highest interest using our advanced (but lower
throughput) FMi tissue chip model that is best suited for mechanistic studies. Our tissue chip model is expected
to enable rapid testing of candidate therapeutics to bring epxperimental drugs more quickly to clinical trials."
10915221,"Summary/abstract: Stimulants provide major challenges in the US. In a recent year, almost 7.5 million
Americans reported cocaine or methamphetamine use. More than 32 million amphetamine prescriptions were
written for conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. 1.75 million Americans
reported amphetamine or cocaine use disorders. There were > 212,000 admissions to stimulant use disorder
treatment programs. However, there is no FDA-approved stimulant use disorder pharmacotherapeutic.
The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase D (PTPRD) is a novel target for new drugs that reduce reward
from stimulants, thus aiding treatment of stimulant use disorders. We have developed pentilludin (NHB1109), a
novel PTPRD phosphatase inhibitor, to advance to clinical use based on work with > 70 novel analogs.
Pentilludin inhibits PTPRD phosphatase with Ki 700 nM potency. It is covered by a nonprovisional patent
application filed with USPO. Pretreatments with 20 mg/kg pentilludin reduce rat amphetamine self
administration and reduce mouse cocaine-conditioned place preferenc. Pentilludin displays good selectivity vs
sites of EUROFINS screens and phosphatases that include PTP1B. It provides good results in studies of its
carcinogenicity, hERG channel effects, CYP activities and CYP induction. It is metabolized in plasma >>
hepatic microsomes and competes for activity of recombinant paraoxonases, supporting its role as a substrate
for these plasma enzymes. Repeated administration of doses > 150 mg/kg po to mice reduce oral intake and
provide weight loss. There is no toxicity noted in dogs, rats or mice repeatedly dosed with 15, 75 and 100
mg/kg/d, respectively (chemistry, hematology or histopathology except idiosyncratic rodent renal tubular
basophilic lesions not seen in dogs, a pattern found with many drugs that provide no human toxicity).
This supplement to UG3 support will move pentilludin closer to the threshold of first use in humans. It will
allow us to add additional doses to our GLP studies in dogs and rats, heeding the advice of consultants that
FDA will wish to see toxicities (reduced oral intake) in GLP as well as non GLP studies. We will continue to
work with NIDA staff, experienced consultants and preIND meetings with FDA officials to complete an efficient
series of IND-enabling research laboratory and GLP studies. Our GLP studies that will confirm nonGLP results
re pentilludin biodistribution, pharmacodynamics and half-life/metabolism at NOAEL and toxic dose levels in
rats and dogs in GLP studies. These data, as well as validation of final step GMP pentilludin syntheses that
optimize purity and yield (with FDA approval) will provide a strong basis for an IND for pentilludin use in human
phase I studies. These supplemental funds will thus aid our ability to reach milestones for the end of the UG3
support period: holding a preIND meeting with FDA staff and addressing each of the FDA concerns that result
from this meeting, facilitating IND submission and phase I clinical studies of this promising compound."
10912162,"Abstract. Autologous fat grafts are widely used for soft tissue reconstruction of congenital deformations,
defects caused by traumatic wounds, oncologic surgery, and improving the form and function of skin
grafts, scar contractures, radiation damage and a variety of aesthetic applications. The long-term results
are often disappointing because of variable and often significant loss of the graft, with clinically observed
1 year resorption rates of up to 70% or more. A major cause of loss of the transplant is inadequate
vascularization of the fat following transplantation. Several strategies have been tried to stimulate
vascularization of transplanted fat, but none have been translated to human use, likely because the stimuli
used to induce angiogenesis are inadequate in potency and/or length of biologic availability. ENYX
Therapeutics, an early-stage biotechnology company focused on using in vivo gene therapy technology to
treat disorders of unmet medical need, is developing a novel, potent, single administration gene therapy to
enhance the survival of autologous fat transplants. The ENYX strategy is to administer ENX02 (Ad5VEGF-
All6A+) to the autologous fat ex vivo prior to transplantation, a E1‾E3‾ serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad) vector
coding for a genomic hybrid coding for all 3 major isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF121, 165 and 189). Ad5VEGF-All6A+ is 10 to 100-fold more potent than an Ad coding for any one
isoform in inducing angiogenesis. Based on preliminary data demonstrating that Ad5 vectors can
effectively genetically modify fat to induce angiogenesis, the hypothesis to be tested is that ENX02 will
genetically modify transplanted human fat to express and secrete VEGF 121, 165 and 189, that in
turn, will induce functional neovascularization into the transplanted fat from the surrounding
tissues, resulting in significantly increased fat transplant survival. In collaboration with the gene
therapy expertise of the R. Crystal laboratory, Department of Genetic Medicine and the pre-clinical and
clinical expertise in reconstructive surgery and fat transplantation of the J. Spector laboratory, Department
of Surgery, all of the technology and infrastructure are in place for assessment of ENX02 to enhance
survival of transplanted human fat. This phase 1 STTR will have the following specific aim. Specific
aim 1. To demonstrate that administration of ENX02 (Ad5VEGF-All6A+) to harvested human fat
prior to transplantation will induce an increased rate and degree of in vivo neovascularization of
the transplanted fat from surrounding tissues resulting in significantly increased survival of the
transplant in immunodeficient mice."

 Continuous training and career support will nurture junior to mid-career faculties and researchers in
Vietnam and Thailand to become regional leaders and driving forces in HIV/AIDS control in Southeast Asia. In
response to PAR-22-151, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) proposes to provide Cutting-edge,
Customized, and Comprehensive (CCC) capacity building for faculties and researchers at Hanoi Medical
University (HMU) in Vietnam and Chiang Mai University (CMU) in Thailand. The partnership is built upon the
three institutes’ previous and current research and training collaborations and will leverage the existing
research and mentoring infrastructures at UCLA, including the David Geffen School of Medicine (DGSOM),
Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment Services (CHIPTS), UCLA-Charles R. Drew University
(CDU) Center for AIDS Research (UCLA-CDU CFAR), Division of Population and Behavioral Health (DPBH)
Center of Excellence (COE), Integrated Substance Abuse Program (ISAP), and University of California Global
Health Institute (UCGHI) GloCal Health Fellowship Program. The CCC program will support four junior to mid-
level faculty from HMU/CMU each year (two from each institute each year in Years 1-4; totaling 16 trainees) to
receive training in three pillars: 1) research (develop research agenda and apply for independent research
funding), 2) mentoring (improve skills and curriculum to teach and mentor the next generation of public health
professionals), and 3) leadership (nurture leadership skills and ascend into leadership positions in a
Southeast Asia HIV Research Advancement Hub [SAHRAH] as a result of this program). Aligned with NIH HIV
priorities, the training contents will center around cutting-edge evidence-based pharmaceutical and bio-
behavioral strategies to prevent and treat HIV and comorbidities. The trainees will receive customized, hands-
on training based on their individualized career development, starting with a 9-month visit at UCLA for intensive
engagement in workshops, seminars, courses, and research projects, followed by a one-year structured in-
country training encompassing in-country research, summer institutes, cross-country networking events, and
exercise of leadership skills within SAHRAH. A highly comprehensive mentorship system, featuring a primary
mentor, in-country mentor, transnational mentor, rotational mentor, and peer mentor, will ensure that trainees
receive holistic guidance in subject expertise, understanding of local culture and resources, and forging global
collaborations. Each trainee will establish individualized SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant,
and time-bound) training objectives based on their HIV-related manuscripts, conference presentations, career
advancement or research proposals, participation in cross-border projects, mentorship in HIV research, and
leadership roles. The program will cultivate SAHRAH with a cadre of multidisciplinary faculties and researchers
in Vietnam and Thailand, positioning them to lead the subsequent cycle of Fogarty training program application
as leaders in HIV research and training in Southeast Asia."

Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying
degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are
emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving
developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment
knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future
targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns.
This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC,
UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of
Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been
productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for
autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the
longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to
TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of
neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS
based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates
with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal
network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated
multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants
will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a
series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project
will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The
proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research
Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization
based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social
development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for
investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified
to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better
characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and
impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants
with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early
life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions."
10914795,"ABSTRACT
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is one of the most prevalent and devastating healthcare-associated
infections. Following standard antibiotic therapy, up to 25% of individuals with CDI develop one or more
recurrences. Persistent or repeated episodes are difficult to treat and are a significant hardship for patients.
The high success rate of fecal microbiota transplant for recurrent CDI provides powerful insight into the
importance of restoring normal gut microbiota. However, to date, there are no microbiological or “omic”
(microbiomic, metagenomic, metabolomic) predictors of C. difficile recurrence. The objective of this proposal is
to determine temporal dynamics of microbial profiles and “omic” signatures associated with C. difficile
recurrence. Our hypothesis is that patients who do not develop a C. difficile recurrence share an identifiable set
of microbes, genes, and fecal metabolites in the gut microbiota. The rationale is that once the temporal
dynamics of microbial and “omic” signatures associated with C. difficile recurrence are well defined, candidate
microbial or “omic” biomarkers can be validated prospectively, ultimately allowing the development of
strategies to prevent recurrent CDI. Specific preemptive therapy (e.g. microbiome manipulation) may then be
developed on the basis of microbial compositions, genes, or metabolites of that microbiota. This novel
approach offers an innovative method for preventing recurrent CDI. We will test the hypothesis by pursuing the
following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the composition and structure of gut microbiota longitudinally in subjects
following CDI, 2) Determine the metagenome of C. difficile gut microbiota, and 3) Perform global metabolomic
analyses using LC-HRMS and GC-MS, including cholesterol and bile acid metabolites, to determine key
metabolites in C. difficile gut microbiota. The approach is innovative because it will utilize a combination of
unbiased, culture-independent 16S rRNA deep sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomic approach and
innovative computational techniques and multivariate statistical methods to identify “omic” signatures in gut
microbiota associated with C. difficile recurrence. The proposed research is significant because there are
virtually no data on the relationship between gut microbiota, omic signatures and C. difficile recurrence. This
proposal will define “omic” signatures that can be validated in future studies, ultimately leading to novel
strategies based on “omic” profiles for primary prevention of recurrent CDI."
10914797,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults with a median survival of less than
15 months despite aggressive standard of care including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Novel therapies
are therefore in critical need. Tumor-derived 2′3′-Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) induced by chemotherapy and
radiation activates STING in myeloid cells as an immunotransmitter to elicit anti-tumor response. Macrophages
and microglia are both potent responder to cGAMP in non-tumor conditions, however, in GBM, macrophages
and microglia, which are one of the most abundant cells in the tumor microenvironment, are profoundly
immunosuppressive. It is unclear through what molecular mechanisms and fundamental biology that
macrophages and microglia minimize STING activation in GBM. While STING signaling is activated by a series
of well-characterized protein phosphorylation, the mechanisms of inactivation/dephosphorylation of STING
signaling is unclear. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine phosphatase comprised of
a catalytic (C), regulatory (B) and scaffolding (A) subunit and accounts for 50-70% of the total serine/threonine
phosphatase activity. The specificity of PP2A is determined by its regulatory B subunit. We have found that
inhibition of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac) in both macrophages and microglia enhances STING signaling.
Mice with macrophages/microglia specific deletion of PP2Ac have increased tumor T cells infiltration and
reduced tumor growth. Moreover, from unbiased screening of all known regulatory B subunits, we find that
striatin4, a specific B subunit of PP2A, has a similar role as PP2Ac in suppressing STING signaling in
macrophages/microglia but not in glioma cells. In this project, we propose to: Aim 1) Determine the impact of
PP2Ac inhibition in macrophages/microglia on STING pathway in glioma microenvironment in vivo. Aim 2)
Elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying STING inhibition by striatin4-PP2Ac complex in
macrophages/microglia. We will also use clinically annotated GBM samples to verify the clinical relevance of
striatin4-PP2A. These findings will firmly establish the role of the specific striatin4-PP2A complex in regulating
macrophage/microglia functions and also provide the mechanistic foundation to target this specific PP2A
complex leading to precise targeting of PP2A as a novel therapy for glioma. This proposed study will also address
the fundamental biology about how glioma cells and macrophages/microglia communicate through cGAMP and
how macrophage/microglia turn off STING activation through PP2A. We appreciate that PP2A complexes play
significant roles not only in macrophages/microglia, but also in glioma cells and other cell types. Our long-term
goal is to identify the specific PP2A complexes in glioma cells, immune cells, astrocytes and other cell types within
the central neural system relevant to the modulation of immune response in order to develop novel therapeutics
for GBM. We believe this study fits to the mission of NINDS to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and
nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease such as brain tumor."
10914842,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
It is estimated that hypertension affects nearly one third of adult Americans (approximately 75 million persons).
Unfortunately, whether the hypertension is treated or not, only approximately 50% of adults with hypertension
have their blood pressure controlled and therefore have higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as
well as increased use of health care resources. Hypertension was listed as the leading or contributing cause of
death in more than 470,000 Americans in 2019 leading to a death rate of 19.9 per 100,000. In 2012, the
calculated total cost of treating hypertension in the US was $51.2 billion and the American Heart Association
(AHA) estimates that the total cost of treating hypertension in the US in 2025 will be $225 billion. In the last five
years, our laboratory has been investigating newer and safer agents from nature that have the potential to treat
and/or protect against hypertension. We have demonstrated that chronic administration of sulforaphane (SF), an
isothiocyanate (ITC), to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) results in preventing the progressive rise
in blood pressure in this animal model. The observed antihypertensive effect of the examined ITC was
significantly correlated with inhibition of the renal soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme in metabolizing
endogenously derived fatty acid epoxide and considered an important therapeutic target in a wide range of
human cardiovascular diseases. Since ITCs are natural products and rich in the diet, they can provide a viable
option for hypertensive patients and prehypertensive individuals who are unable or unwilling to use current
antihypertensive agents because of their cost, adverse effects, or risk of drug-drug interactions. These
individuals will not only benefit from the potential antihypertensive effect of ITCs, but also receive the
documented chemoprevention, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects associated with their use. The
objective of this proposal is to study the sEH inhibition and blood pressure lowering effects of several naturally-
occurring ITCs, and to identify the structural factors that modulate their effectiveness as sEH inhibitors. The
positive impact of this research is to identify potent antihypertensive ITCs with favorable pharmacokinetic
properties and affordable cost. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the potency, selectivity, and mechanism of inhibition
of human and rat sEH by ITCs. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the anti-hypertensive effect of the most active ITC
compound in SHR. This application offers excellent research training opportunities for undergraduate and
graduate students, furthers and strengthens Dr. Elbarbry and his team’s research skills and preparedness for
other proposals, and will make significant contributions to the enhancement of the Pacific University’s research
infrastructure."
10914843,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With the spread of COVID-19, public health precautions have required physical distancing and a variety of
shelter-in-place orders, causing rapid and substantial shifts in all aspects of family and community life. Data
from COVID-19, supported by evidence from past national emergencies, suggest caregivers are at clear risk
for secondary health effects because of the current pandemic. COVID-19 has been described as a “perfect
vector for a mental health epidemic” due to the accumulated effects of pandemic-related fear, social isolation,
post-traumatic stress, and mental health treatment barriers. These changes to daily life have been especially
challenging for families of children with neurogenetic conditions (NGC), who experience high levels of baseline
stress, are particularly vulnerable to reductions in targeted therapeutic services, and rely on medical and
educational services that have been disrupted by COVID-19 related closures. Specifically, caregivers
themselves are vulnerable to stress-related mental and physical health challenges because of the pandemic;
they rarely receive treatment for their own mental health needs, and any treatments they do receive are
typically disconnected from their child's care plan and are delivered by practitioners with little-to-no expertise
in the needs of NGC families. These health care gaps are amplified among Black and other minority families.
The proposed study will address the needs of caregivers of children with NGC by examining the feasibility,
efficacy, and impact of a novel network for delivering personalized triage and digital treatment. Specifically, we
propose to scale up and integrate a series of brief, evidence based digital health interventions to support
caregiver mental health, parenting self-efficacy, and stress. Supervised graduate student trainees will
implement rigorous, cost-effective, evidence-based interventions via telehealth. A key innovation of this work
is that we will develop a personalized health routing algorithm that matches participants with relevant
treatments using both clinical inputs and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data, brief questionnaires
“pinged” to caregiver phones via a smartphone app. A second innovation is that we will test the efficacy of
peer-to-peer coaching in enhancing treatment uptake and outcomes. Coaching will be delivered by fellow NGC
caregivers using an evidence-based motivational interviewing protocol. By the end of the award period, we will
have generated a novel, scalable, and cost-effective solution for rapidly meeting acute needs for NGC
caregivers through personalized, digital delivery of evidence-based treatments. This model can be rapidly
scaled for other high-risk populations during COVID-19 (e.g. first responders, teachers, frontline workers) and
future public health crises. Given substantial unmet needs existed among NGC families even prior to COVID-
19, this protocol has potential to fundamentally shift the status-quo for how treatment is selected and accessed
in NGC caregivers and other underserved groups, including beyond the COVID-19 pandemic."
10914845,"Summary/Abstract
Inflammation has important roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but whether
inflammation is causal, an amplifier of alternative triggering mechanisms, or an epiphenomenon remains unclear.
Prior studies in this area have largely focused on innate immunity, sterile models, and single cytokines or cells
in the absence of a well-defined pathobiological context—approaches that cannot address aspects of adaptive
immunity or innate-adaptive immunity crosstalk which contribute to vascular disease. To address these
limitations, our group studies the parasite Schistosoma, the cause of schistosomiasis which may be the most
prevalent form of PAH worldwide. Using a Schistosoma-pulmonary hypertension (PH) murine model, studies in
the prior period identified a series of mechanistic events which are critical for PH development: Th2-activation of
CD4 T cells in the lungs; which recruit of CCR2+ Ly6c+ monocytes to the adventitial space that express
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1); and the TSP-1 functionally activates latent TGF-β, causing vascular remodeling.
This proposal builds on this foundation by now interrogating adaptive and innate immune interfaces that we
believe to be necessary to Schistosoma-PH pathogenesis. We extend our studies to translational analysis of
human biospecimens, seeking proteins that correlate with PAH presence in an at-risk group with severe
schistosomiasis. This proposal will test the hypothesis that intrapulmonary dendritic cells (DCs) present
Schistosoma antigen to CD4 T cells which support Th2 polarization, causing activation of interstitial
macrophages (IMs), who release the CCR2 ligands CCLs 2, 7 and 12, driving TSP-1+ monocyte recruitment,
TGF-β activation, and PH. We also hypothesize that key proteins that increase risk of PAH—including CCL2,
CCL7, CCL12, and TSP-1—can be detected in human plasma. We propose 4 Aims. Aim 1 will determine that
antigen presentation by a specific DC subset, cDC2s, is required for T cell activation in Schistosoma-PH. Aim 2
will determine if the balance of Th1 to Th2 inflammation drives monocyte/macrophage and PH phenotypes in
Schistosoma-PH. Aim 3 will determine that CCL2/7/12 release by IMs is required for TSP1+ monocyte
recruitment in Schistosoma-PH. Aim 4 will identify plasma proteins associated with PAH development in subjects
with schistosomiasis. This translational Aim will be achieved by developing and characterizing two cohorts of
subjects recruited from 4 clinical centers in Brazil: subjects with the precursor condition schistosomiasis
hepatosplenic disease (SchHSD) who are unlikely to have PAH on the basis of echocardiography screening,
and subjects with SchHSD who have right heart catheterization-confirmed PAH. Completion of these studies will
lead to understanding the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the development of Schistosoma-PAH, and
create opportunities for entirely novel approaches to diagnosing and potentially treating this disease. We propose
to identify mechanistic proteins which correlate with disease presence in blood, facilitating screening of at-risk
subjects in low-resource areas."
10919234,"In the United States, infection is now the most common cause of direct maternal mortality and the third leading
cause overall after cardiovascular conditions and other pre-existing medical conditions. Nationally, there has
been no improvement in the overall percentage of deaths from infection since 1987 when the CDC began
maternal mortality surveillance, despite improvements in overall sepsis care for nonpregnant patients. The
long-term goal is to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from maternal sepsis. The central hypothesis is
that though community leadership, addressing barriers, and intensive implementation of standardized
pregnancy-adjusted screening, diagnosis, and treatment that maternal morbidity from infection and sepsis will
decrease. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) identify patient-based and clinician-based barriers;
(ii) refine sepsis screening in pregnancy; and (iii) implement a large-scale quality improvement collaborative.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: UG3 phase 1) Develop and
support a Maternal Sepsis Community Leadership Group of community representatives, patients, patient
advocates, and survivors and family members of those who did not survive to inform and engage substantively
throughout the study; 2A) Identify patient-based barriers to care for severe maternal infection and sepsis; 2B)
Design strategies to implement evidence-based sepsis
care interventions, specifically targeted to address and overcome barriers identified in Aims 2A and 2B; 3)
Establish test characteristics of a pregnancy-adjusted intrapartum sepsis screen. Once barriers have been
identified with strategies to overcome them and the sepsis screening, diagnosis, and treatment care practices
have been adjusted based on qualitative and quantitative data it will be transitioned to the UH3 phase. UH3

Identify clinician-based barriers to implementation; 2C)
Implement refined sepsis screening, diagnostic, and treatment care practices in California and Michigan
and evaluate outcomes of maternal morbidity and mortality. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because it is one of the first studies to co-lead a large-scale maternal initiative with representatives
from the community, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), patient advocate representatives, and patients and
families with lived experience with sepsis. This research is significant because it is expected that by identifying
and addressing barriers to care and implementation through community, clinician, patient and DEI
partnerships, this large-scale implementation initiative will serve as a national model to reduce maternal
mortality and morbidity from sepsis, and potentially serve as a model to address other causes of mortality."

Postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is common and often missed with routine spot
check-based monitoring of patients on the hospital ward and post-acute care areas. The evolving role of
continuous portable monitoring systems is of obvious benefit in these clinical settings. There is limited
evidence using retrospective and prospective observational data that continuous monitoring systems increase
detection of these perturbations compared to conventional monitoring. We plan to host a consensus
conference to improve definitions and innovations for identification and prevention of postoperative opioid-
induced respiratory depression (OIRD). We plan to develop a set of working definitions for OIRD based on
available high-quality evidence and by using the expertise of a diverse group of stakeholders available for this
meeting. Our definition will be a combination of physiological variables, thresholds, durations of derangement
and type of monitoring utilized. Furthermore, we will discuss frameworks for the design of future clinical trials.
Most evidence so far has used advanced and continuous ward monitoring in prospective observation studies
or with before and after type study designs to estimate the incidence of OIRD. Appropriate interventional
studies to ascertain the effect of monitoring on OIRD are lacking. These are not easy to design or implement,
because of a combination of factors on the hospital wards including but not limited to alarm fatigue, nursing
staffing ratios, understanding perceptions to vital signs alarms and response times, and the inability to remove
a Hawthorne effect. A highly experienced, diverse group of clinical trialists will discuss and suggest designs for
innovative trial mechanisms that will circumvent some of these obstacles and provide a schematic with options
for clinical trials that would be robust, easy to implement, pragmatic, and with appropriately defined patient-
centric outcomes that are able to be measured accurately. Finally, we will identify opportunities for technology
development collaborations to improve wireless monitoring and detection of postoperative OIRD and the use
artificial intelligence to detect patterns that predict patient deterioration events in real-time. Participants will
discuss how the advent of increasingly portable monitoring that includes wireless and wearable solutions on
the general hospital floor is changing the landscape for patient surveillance. Since acute cardio-respiratory
instability events are generally preceded by several hours of a gradual change in vital signs patterns, high
fidelity monitoring allows this digital fingerprint of patient decline to be accurately tracked in real time.
Participants will seek to build a consortium to advance science and improve patient safety in the context of a
multi-pronged approach to OIRD prevention. In addition to publications and research this group will liaise with
industry, regulatory authorities, funders, and patient safety advocacy groups. Conference products will be
informed by current primary literature, expert opinion, existing guidelines and industry standards, and they will
be disseminated via consensus publications, professional society meetings, websites, and social media."

Since 2004, Vasculata conferences have been convening across various academic institutions in the United
States. This conference falls under the auspices of the North American Vascular Biology Organization (NAVBO),
and the NAVBO Education Committee selects the hosting site for each year. At their last meeting, the committee
unanimously chose Stanford University as the host of the 2024 meeting. This meeting has steadily grown over
the years from 60 attendees in 2004 to 120 attendees in its 2017 version at University of Illinois at Chicago.
Vasculata in a nutshell is an intense “boot camp” that introduces students and fellows to vascular biology.
Emphasis of the host site (Stanford University) is on short seminars covering a defined curriculum and reading
assignments in the original literature. Contact with local faculty and fellows, including within workshops and
poster sessions, is a critical aspect of the course. The meeting will be hosted at Stanford University and will
introduce the local academic environment, especially vascular biology minded researchers, to the scientific
community. Stanford University, University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and University of California
Berkeley (UC Berkeley) have a rich history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research as well as the
development of cutting-edge techniques in biological sciences and at this meeting will disseminate the
knowledge and expertise to the community. The Bay Area and Silicon Valley is known for translating discoveries
into clinical applications and the third day of the meeting will be devoted to approaches to translate basic research
findings into the clinic. Training next generation scientists and underrepresented minorities in vascular research
is a key objective, and will be facilitated at this conference. Researchers from the Bay Area study a variety of
topics including endothelial cell biology, pulmonary and cerebro-vascular disease, induced pluripotent stem cells
as preclinical tools for high-throughput screening, disease modeling and drug testing, pediatric pulmonary
circulation, congenital heart defect, blood-vascular interface, immune-vascular interface, 3D deep tissue
imaging, drug-repurposing and vascular malformation research. Stanford Healthcare and Lucile Packard
Children’s hospital Stanford are home to a comprehensive vascular anomaly clinic for over 20 years and both,
Stanford and UCSF, are Centers of Excellence for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia. All these areas of
research are of interest and directly relevance to the NHLBI mission. Further, training, dissemination of new
knowledge through workshops and presentations, and providing career-related information to trainees fit with
the education mission of NHLBI."

This application seeks partial support for “Modeling Hearing and Balance Disorders in Mice: The HEar@JAX
Workshop”, to be held at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in Bar Harbor, ME, on September 15-20, 2024. This
recurring biennial workshop is one of a kind as it 1) specifically focuses on the use of the mouse model to
investigate fundamental and translational questions about hearing and balance, and 2) has a compact 5-day
format with morning lectures and afternoon laboratory time. The course is an intensive training opportunity for
20 graduate or medical students, postdocs or investigators who are either new to the inner ear field, or new to
the mouse model. Six organizers and eight invited speakers are ideally qualified to give lectures and laboratory
training in their own fields to broadly cover inner ear research, in particular the periphery. The lectures will address
human and mouse genetics-based gene discovery, mouse models of hearing loss and balance disorders, development
and regeneration of the inner ear, mechanotransduction, afferent and efferent innervation, brainstem function, noise-
and age-related hearing loss, ototoxicity and synaptopathy. Modern techniques including single cell approaches and
viral and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene therapy will be discussed. An otolaryngologist’s perspective on patients with
hearing loss will also be presented. Laboratory time will include cochlear dissections for immunolabeling or for organ
culture. Live cultures will be used for calcium imaging, antibiotic damage and to test transduction channel function.
Confocal microscopy of fixed or live samples representing normal and mutant tissues will enable participants to observe
defects resulting in hearing loss and vestibular disorders. Other activities will include inner ear gene transfer,
paint-fill, as well as practical and interactive tutorials for physiological testing (e.g., ABR, DPOAE) and to navigate the
gEAR database. All lecture slides and protocols introduced during the course will be made available to
participants to maximize the benefits of attending the course. A hallmark of this workshop is the close interaction
between participants and faculty at the Highseas Conference Center, which also serves as the residence and
dining facility. Sharing meals and other social activities encourages network development and fosters
collaboration. To enhance their visibility, participants will have the opportunity to present a poster about their
own research.

The 23rd Midwest DNA Repair Symposium (MDRS) will take place in Louisville, KY on June 1-2, 2024 at
the Health Science Campus of the University of Louisville. The MDRS started in 1999 at the University of
Michigan – Ann Arbor and has met at various universities in the Midwest every year since then except for
a 3-year hiatus imposed by the COVID19 pandemic. The Midwest DNA Repair Symposium was originally
conceived as a forum to bring together DNA repair researchers from the Midwestern region on an annual
basis to discuss ongoing research, to stimulate collaborations, and to interact with leading DNA repair
researchers in an informal atmosphere. In 2024, we will have 3 eminent DNA repair researchers as keynote
speakers continuing the history of leading researchers gladly accepting the invitation. Additional goals of
the MDRS include making the cost of attending the symposium as inexpensive as possible and to provide
early stage investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students priority in presenting their work in
oral and poster sessions. DNA repair is a fundamental cellular process critical to maintenance of genome
integrity and human health. DNA repair dysfunction has been linked with many inherited diseases as well
as chronic diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and aging. The
organizers are pleased that this symposia series has been very successful and has seen significant
increase in attendance the past several years. One key to the success has been to keep the costs of
attendance low. This low cost has been possible because the organizers for each year held the symposium
at their home institutions and have secured both intramural and extramural funding to cover some of the
major expenses. Especially in times of restricted research funding, the MDRS is one quality conference to
which PI’s have been able to bring their students and post-doctoral fellows to interact with leading scientists
in the field and to present their work among peers. To celebrate its 25th anniversary the MDRS is returning
to Louisville for the third time in 2024. The three principal goals of the MDRS are: 1) to provide a venue for
scientists mainly but not exclusively, from the Midwestern States to present and discuss current research
in the field of DNA damage, repair and mutagenesis, and to provide opportunities to foster scientific
collaborations. (2) To provide students, postdoctoral fellows, and early stage investigators the opportunity
to present their work to peers and to interact with leaders in the field. (3) To provide an exceptional value
of these symposia by keeping them affordable."
10907295,"The NIH has long recognized the steady decline in the physician-scientist workforce. We have great concern
over the critical shortage of physician-scientists in the field of Infectious Disease. We are equally concerned
about assuring the next generation of leaders needed to combat the emergence of new pathogens. Even
more, the gap between clinical and laboratory investigators limits the potential for progress. The recent SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic, mpox epidemic, and multiple filovirus outbreaks have highlighted these challenges. This R13
proposal requests support for a symposium on “Tropical and Emerging Infectious Diseases for Clinicians and
Translational Scientists” to be held in Galveston, Texas, April 9-12, 2024. The overarching goal is to ignite
interest of physician and scientist trainees in the evolving field of tropical and emerging infectious diseases. We
will convene 60-80 clinician and scientist participants along with speakers who are global leaders in this field.
The target audience will be clinical trainees with an interest in developing as clinician-scientists and PhD
postdoctoral fellows with an interest in clinical/translational research. We strongly believe that interprofessional
and multidisciplinary collaboration is essential to move the field forward. The Specific Aims of this symposium
and R13 application are twofold. Specific Aim 1 is to ignite interest in the field of tropical and emerging
infectious diseases through a program that captures recent research advances and next steps for moving the
field forward. Toward this end the 2½-day symposium will have 5 keynote addresses and 18 speaker
presentations that will be organized in 4 blocks around key themes of 1) One Health approach to Emerging
Infectious diseases, 2) Emergence of antimicrobial resistance, 3) Special Pathogens: From the Laboratory to
the Bedside, and 4) Global emergence of vector-borne diseases in the era of climate change. Specific Aim 2 is
to promote career development opportunities for junior-level clinicians and scientists through peer-to-peer
interactions and discussions with leaders in the field. This will be promoted by a unique format, which includes
attendees and speakers having intentional but informal interaction over meals, multiple structured small group
discussion sessions, and an interactive poster session. Select attendees will present their own research
through oral presentations. Finally, tours will be offered of UTMB’s Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), a
Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) research facility on the UTMB campus, and UTMB’s Biocontainment Care Unit
(BCU) which is a Regional Emerging and Special Pathogens Treatment Center. Targeted efforts will be made
to ensure that women, attendees with accompanying children, under-represented minorities, and persons with
disabilities will attend this symposium. This symposium will spark interest in clinical and translational research
in tropical and emerging infectious diseases and will provide a forum for junior clinicians to gain a vision for
how they could successfully embark on a career as a physician-scientist. Funds from the R13 application
would be used to offer travel scholarships for trainees who submit an abstract of their own research."
10915432,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the introduction of live oral rotavirus vaccines into more than 90 countries worldwide, rotavirus remains
a leading cause of severe diarrhea in children and a major source of morbidity and mortality in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). Rotavirus vaccination has been effective at controlling the burden of
rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis (RVGE) in high-income countries, but the response, efficacy, and impact of
current live oral rotavirus vaccines is lower in LMICs for multiple reasons that are still not fully understood. New
vaccines and approaches may be needed to overcome the poor immune response to current live oral rotavirus
vaccines in LMICs. Next-generation rotavirus vaccines, including neonatal and parenteral subunit vaccines, are
currently in development and undergoing clinical trials at our field sites in Malawi and Ghana. Models are
needed to extrapolate the results of these trials to the population level. We will use mathematical models to
predict the potential impact of different rotavirus vaccination strategies, accounting for both the direct and
indirect effects of vaccination. We will then conduct economic evaluations to determine the most cost-effective
approach to reducing the burden of diarrhea due to rotavirus. We will begin by focusing on Malawi and Ghana,
where we have previously developed models and have good pre- and post-vaccination surveillance data. We
will then extend our approach to predict vaccine impact and cost-effectiveness across all LMICs. Our analyses
will help to better define the vaccine response, duration of immunity, and price at which next-generation
rotavirus vaccines are likely to be cost-effective, and will provide a validated platform that decision-makers in
LMICs can use to weigh the costs and benefits of different rotavirus vaccination strategies in their country."
10914512,"Kidney disease represents a significant growing threat to public health. Unfortunately, efforts to find effective
prevention strategies and innovative new treatments have been hampered by a paucity of kidney disease
researchers. Traditional workforce pipelines are drying up, and low awareness of kidney disease has made it
difficult to attract talented scientists outside of nephrology and medicine from other spheres of science, despite
major technological and conceptual advances in the kidney science field. We propose a new program to address
this need, focusing nationally on a diverse pool of talented undergraduate students broadly interested in
biomedical sciences and biomedical engineering. This new program, Johns Hopkins Summer Undergraduate
Program in Kidney Science (SUPerKS), will leverage the unique resources of a preeminent university to provide
trainees with innovative research opportunities, mentoring by leaders and rising stars in the field, exciting didactic
and problem-based training experiences, clinical immersion, intellectual enrichment activities, team-building and
social events over the summer. SUPerKS will operate within the Kidney Physiology and Precision Medicine
Center, which brings together a diverse, highly dynamic group of investigators from clinical and basic science
departments within the JHU Schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Engineering to work on kidney science
challenges. Other innovations include a kidney-focused curriculum, mentorship training, and an institutionally
funded administrative office that is devoted to supporting summer internship programs with special emphasis on
the recruitment of under-represented minority candidates and those from disadvantaged economic backgrounds.
At the end of the training cycle, the trainees and their projects will be celebrated in a summer programs event at
Johns Hopkins. Students will also travel to present their work and meet participants in the other programs funded
by this mechanism. SUPerKS trainees will exit the program with an appreciation for the value of research,
improved interpersonal-communication skills, and a more sophisticated understanding and appreciation of the
kidney. After 5 years of operation, the SUPerKS program should train 40 diverse and talented students advancing
toward careers in the biomedical sciences, especially in the kidney science fields."
10914353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Every year, 1.5 million emergency room visits are COPD exacerbates. Lack of remote patient management and
telehealth primes most COPD patients to visit the emergency room and be admitted to the hospital. The health
and economic burden of these visits’ costs more than $24 billion annually. Remote patient management in COPD
can prompt treatment, prevent symptoms from worsening, lead to healthy lifestyle changes, and improve patient
outcomes. We are developing a novel product that can make quality healthcare more accessible and
convenient, allowing healthcare providers to manage more patients, reduce the risk of hospitalization through
prompt treatment (remote patient monitoring) by focusing on prevention over treatment, and reduce the overall
healthcare cost. Our product is a stand-alone environmental exposure and lung health monitoring system
designed to measure personal exposure to pollutants and triggers to respiratory distress, assess respiratory
functions, and transfer data to healthcare providers for early intervention, patient management, and
medication adjustment. This product allows physicians to receive alerts when a patient's reading is too high
and keep an eye out for at-risk patients for quick action to prevent symptoms from worsening and better
medical decision-making while enabling patients to engage in healthier lifestyle choices. The main objective
of the proposed research to be completed within phase I is to advance prototype I into an intelligent
version with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity to instantly transfer data to a patient's smartphone and
healthcare professionals for daily assessment and patient monitoring. The advanced and intelligent version
will be miniaturized in weight, size, and power consumption for easy use and tested by focus groups for
comments on durability and usability. We will achieve the following metrics of success before advancing to phase
II: 1. Compare the performance of the product's finalized design with Lab test equipment (sensors) data after
calibration, 2. Evaluate the speed in data transfer and connectability in software (connection speed <2 s (after
finding the BLE of the device and adding the device's ID), time to deliver the collected data of one day <3
minutes), 3. Processing data and generating a prediction, 4. Comparison of sensor data with the station data for
air pollution, expecting less than 5% deviation, and 5. Test the durability of the system, hardware (battery,
sensors, package/housing), and software (codes, storing data, network connectivity) for long use without
malfunctioning, and 6. Use the System Usability Scale (SUS) Test with a score > 70% as an acceptable
milestone. Our product is expected to reduce the risk and cost of hospitalization by focusing on remote
patient management, early identification, and prevention. It will allow healthcare providers to keep an
eye on their high-risk patients in between clinic visits and help prevent COPD from worsening and
hospital stays while allowing patients to stay in contact with their doctors and make healthy lifestyle
changes."
10914530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The applicant company, Asymmetrex® LLC, proposes a project to design and build the first laboratory
instrument that provides automated electronic counting of tissue stem cells (TSCs). Currently, no
instrument with this capability is available. Preparations containing TSCs like hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs), which are used for approved stem cell transplantation therapies and experimental stem cell and
gene therapies, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are the focus of many current stem cell
clinical trials, are administered without knowing the number of stem cells delivered. Quantitative TSC-
specific dosing would improve patients’ outcomes from approved stem cell treatments like HSC
transplantation and improve the design, statistical power, and interpretation of stem cell clinical trials.
There are similar needs for improving TSC research, cell and tissue biomanufacturing, and
pharmaceutical drug development that would be addressed by a convenient method to determine
the TSC-specific fraction (SCF) and dosage of treatment, research, production, and drug testing
samples, respectively. In the precursor SBIR Phase I project, Asymmetrex® successfully validated its
new kinetic stem cell (KSC) counting method with a head-to-head comparison to the only existing
method for quantifying the specific fraction of TSCs in a sample. That method, the SCID mouse
repopulating cell (SRC) assay, can be used to determine the specific fraction of only one type of TSCs,
HSCs. Even with its application for HSCs, the SRC assay has been of limited use for research and
medicine because its requirements are impractical for routine application. Using primary tissue cell
culture and computational simulation, Asymmetrex’s KSC counting method is the first-ever practical
solution for routine determination of the SCF of cell preparations from any tissue, including tissues from
human and animal donors. Being a computational method, KSC counting is ideal for implementation
with a small-footprint benchtop counting instrument. The currently available second iteration of the
KSC counting method requires only 72 hours of cell culture and conventional cell counting.
Asymmetrex® will design and build an instrument that automates the culture and counting of a tissue
cell preparation test sample and inputs the resulting data into on-board KSC counting algorithm
software that computes the SCF. The objective of this project is to design and build a manufacturing-
ready instrument that is validated for counting HSCs and MSCs found in common human tissue cell
sources used for research and medicine."
10916200,"Project Summary/Abstract
Down Syndrome (DS) is a common birth defect caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). DS leads
to a vast array of clinical abnormalities affecting most systems of the body, including delayed wound healing, and
an increased risk of long bone and vertebral fractures. Previously, this laboratory has shown that DS patients
have low bone turnover leading to decreased bone mineral density and delayed accrual of peak adult bone
mass, and also confirmed the low bone mass phenotype in mouse models of DS. Additionally, it has been
recently reported that COX2/PGE2 expression is impaired in DS human dermal fibroblasts, which could
contribute to the delayed wound healing and increased risk of infections in the DS population. PGE2 and its
receptors are major mediators of inflammation, wound healing, bone formation and bone healing. More
specifically, the PGE2 receptor subunit 2 (EP2, Ptger2) and EP4, have been shown to regulate bone formation,
and play a crucial role in fracture healing, whereas EP3 and EP4 contribute to macrophage recruitment, the
immune response, and lymphangiogenesis in wound healing. However, what is not known is how PGE2
signaling contributes to bone repair and whether low bone accrual in DS impacts bone regeneration. The
overarching objective of this proposal is to characterize bone healing in DS mouse models and determine if
pharmaceutical treatment at different stages during the regenerative process is able to enhance regeneration in
DS. This project will test the hypothesis that bone healing is significantly impaired in DS, and that decreased
bone turnover leads to attenuated bone regeneration. This study will utilize the DS mouse models, Dp16 and
Ts65Dn, that demonstrate the low bone mass phenotype consistent with the low bone mass observed in DS
patients, to investigate de novo bone regeneration after amputation of the terminal phalanx (P3). P3 amputation
is a model of mammalian injury that faithfully triggers a well-defined regenerative sequence of events that initiates
with inflammation followed by bone resorption, wound closure, and de novo bone formation, allowing the
characterization of the entire injury response. Experiments in Aim 1 will seek to characterize P3 regeneration in
the DS mouse models compared to WT littermates to test the hypothesis that bone regeneration is impaired in
DS mouse models. Aim 2 will investigate the early, or lytic, phase of regeneration and determine whether
treatment with a PGE2 receptor (EP3 and EP4) agonist elicits an immune and wound healing response that is
sufficient to enhance regeneration in DS. The proposed studies of de novo bone regeneration will help to close
the gap in knowledge regarding how DS impacts bone healing and repair, and provide insight into how patient
care can be modified to adequately treat bone injuries in the at-risk DS population."

Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) cost the healthcare system around $2 billion annually
with an estimated >80,000 incidents each year in US intensive care units (ICUs). That is not surprising with over
5 million central venous catheters (CVCs) used annually in the United States and an estimated 27 million units
sold globally. Most CVC-associated infections are caused by microorganisms introduced from patient skin during
catheter insertion. These microorganisms can also get into the lumen during manipulation and attach to device
surfaces, enhance biofilm growth and complications and result in infections.
Currently, there are two main approaches to reducing CVC-related infections either (1) adding antimicrobial
functionality or (2) adding antifouling functionality. Our approach combines antifouling and antimicrobial killing
functionalities to prevent catheter-associated infections and thrombosis into a new polymer additive product
(HaloAddTM) that catheter manufacturers can blend with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). We are aware of no
other similar approach that combines antimicrobial agents with anti-inflammatory and/or anti-adhesion agents to
address the complex problem of CLABSI.
This Phase I effort is geared towards answering basic performance, safety, and efficacy issues. We propose to
optimize polymer blending parameters to develop HaloAdd-modified PU material with maximum antimicrobial
and antifouling efficacy without impacting critical mechanical properties, determine in vitro anti-thrombin and anti-
biofilm properties, and verify the biocompatibility and stability of HaloAdd-blended PU for the CVC application."
10916554,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) is a major public health problem in the USA. About 100,000
American infants were exposed to opioids in 2017 and 25,000 of these infants were diagnosed with NOWS.
Opioid-exposed infants have poorer outcomes compared to similar non-exposed infants including longer and
more complicated initial hospital stays, higher likelihood of involvement in the child welfare system, higher
rates of hospital readmission and emergency department visits, and lower use of recommended preventive
services. One group of infants at particularly high risk for adverse outcomes are infants who receive
pharmacological therapy to treat signs of withdrawal. Importantly, the care, treatment, and outcomes of these
infants vary widely between birth hospitals and US states. Such variation suggests that the optimal
pharmacological treatment for NOWS remains unknown, potentially exposing these infants to unnecessary or
ineffective management.
The NOWS Treatment Trial will assess the optimal pharmacological treatment for NOWS through a
multicenter, comparative effectiveness trial comparing three commonly used medications. This application
describes the CHOP/Penn Neonatal Clinical Trials Network, our outstanding team of investigators with vast
clinical trial experience, our unparalleled research environment, and our large and diverse patient population
which together ensure that we are ideally suited to participate in the design and execution of the NOWS
Treatment Trial. We will contribute expertise in clinical trial methodology, substance abuse, and neonatal
follow-up, providing rigorous scientific input into design and implementation of the multicenter NOWS
Treatment Trial. We will then execute all aspects of the trial to the highest standard, including robust participant
recruitment, rigorous adherence to all aspects of the study protocol, and neurodevelopmental follow-up to two
years with minimal attrition."
10917407,"Systems Bioinformatics Core (Core B) SUMMARY
H-CARR is designed to interrogate the genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic drivers of acquired cisplatin
resistance in HNSCC. Projects 1, 2 and 3 are designed to synergize with the ultimate dual objective of: 1)
identifying reliable biomarkers of cisplatin resistance and 2) developing strategies for preventing its development
or acquisition. Project 1 will generate steady state and flux metabolomic data which will be integrated with the
genomic and transcriptomic data generated in Project 2. Together, the datasets will then be validated against
human data acquired using non-invasive metabolic imaging and genomic and transcriptomic analysis of human
HNSCC circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
 Core B is envisioned as a Systems Bioinformatics Core which will coalesce the datastreams from all 3
Projects into one coherent multi ‘omics understanding of cisplatin response and development of resistance. Core
B, led by Dr. Coarfa is tasked with performing the complex data analysis proposed in each individual Project and
developing pipelines for data acquisition, analysis and interpretation which can be rapidly deployed within H-
CARR and the broader ARTNet scientific community. Core B, in collaboration with Core A (Administrative) will
develop a near real time reporting system for both model (PDX, cell line) generation, analytical pipelines and
raw and processed data sharing with other investigators. The Core will leverage existing institutional expertise
with big data analysis, along with Dr. Coarfa’s established scientific relationships with the other investigators, to
develop a state of the art analytical platform that can be deployed to characterize and understanding acquired
resistance across multiple solid tumors and systemic agents."

10917422,"ABSTRACT – DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS CORE
The Developmental Therapeutics Core (DTC) supports LCC investigators in the preclinical testing of novel
therapeutics, as well as established agents that are being repurposed, with the primary intent of addressing the
merit of advancing novel agents and strategies for clinical trial evaluation. The DTC provides a range of
preclinical testing services that include: in vitro tumor cell assays; in vivo subcutaneous and orthotopic models
for studying tumor growth, as well as for studying tumor response to therapy; exploratory pharmacokinetics; and
exploratory toxicology. The DTC also assists investigators with drug formulations and initial assessments of drug
stability. A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) repository provides investigators with more than 60 tumor models
representing 12 different types of cancer for in vivo testing of therapies against human tumors. The DTC also
maintains a repository with more than 200 human tumor cell lines, many of which can also be used for xenograft
establishment and therapeutic testing. DTC staff are proficient in all routes of treatment administration and in
small animal surgery, provide consulting and training, and accelerate implementation of studies through simple
modification of blanket IACUC protocols. DTC staff advise faculty on study design, and assist with the
interpretation and presentation of results for manuscripts and grant applications. The DTC coordinates studies
with other LCC shared resources in providing LCC members an integrated and expeditious process for achieving
study objectives.
During the most recent CCSG grant year the core has had a significant impact on LCC research in aiding 52
Cancer Center members, contributing to publications, and generating results that have helped in obtaining an
IND from the FDA for two novel therapeutics that are undergoing clinical trial evaluation in first in human studies.
During the current CCSG term, the DTC has assisted LCC members in the preparation of more than 40 grant
applications that have resulted in $17M in new external support for LCC research. Experimental results obtained
in association with DTC assistance have resulted in 5 patents and 7 applications, and have contributed to the
founding of six start-up companies. During the next period of CCSG support, the DTC will continue its robust
level of PDX research activity, but will also emphasize the use of syngeneic mouse model tumors for studying
immunologic effects of therapy, as well as for testing immunotherapies in animal subjects with an intact, fully
functioning immune system."

ABSTRACT – FLOW CYTOMETRY CORE FACILITY
The Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry Core Facility provides comprehensive flow
cytometry and cell sorting services for investigators of the Lurie Cancer Center and Northwestern University. Its
central mission is to provide guidance, technical assistance, and equipment for investigators to utilize routine and
complex multi-parametric, multi-laser measurements as well as cell sorting, regardless of their level of cytometry
expertise. The Flow Cytometry Core Facility serves individuals interested in cellular-based measurements and
cellular heterogeneity in malignancies, providing critical support for cancer-related research. Services provided
by the facility extend from consultation on experimental design, sample preparation and data analysis to
instrument operation and set-up for cell sorting and multi-laser operation. The Core also has an active program
of flow cytometry protocol and assay development guided by the interests and needs of the investigators. The
Core has extensive experience in developing and implementing complex multi-parametric assays with particular
expertise in intracellular labile antigen detection such as phosphorylated protein epitopes. User training for
operation of analysis and cell sorting instruments gives users around-the-clock access and allows the maximum
use of the Core’s instruments.
The Flow Cytometry Core Facility serves both the Chicago and Evanston campuses. The Chicago campus facility
has 5 cell sorters: Two 5 laser/15-17 parameter BD FACSAria SORP cell sorters, a 6 laser/15-17 parameter BD
FACSAria SORP cell sorter, a 3 laser/10-12 parameter BD FACSAria SORP cell sorter and a 3 laser/10
parameter BD FACSMelody cell sorter. The Chicago campus facility also has three benchtop flow cytometry
analyzers; 6 laser/18 parameter BD LSRFortessa SORP, another 6 laser/18 parameter BD LSRFortessa, which
is being upgraded to 30 parameters and a soon to be purchased Apogee Micro-Plus flow cytometer for small
particle analysis. In addition, the Chicago facility has a Nexcelom cell counter/viability instrument (Nexcelom
Bioscience, LLC). On the Evanston campus, we have one 4 laser, 13 parameter BD FACSAria IIu and a 4
laser/13 parameter BD LSRII. Both facilities have multiple offline analysis workstations providing the components
and all advanced software for post-acquisition data analysis and graphics generation. The Core is heavily utilized
by a wide number of investigators (207) with 63% who are Cancer Center members."
10917424,"ABSTRACT – HIGH THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS LABORATORY 
The High Throughput Analysis laboratory (HTA) enables LCC researchers to develop, perform, and analyze 
large scale experiments that elucidate the fundamental biology of cancer and launch the discovery of novel 
therapeutic agents. Such projects can involve parallel manipulation of tens of thousands of samples as well as 
data collection and analysis at a similar scale. To support this work the facility provides advanced technology, 
technical expertise, and resources like compound and gene disruptor libraries for diverse high throughput 
screens (HTS) on biochemical targets and cell processes. HTA staff partner with LCC researchers to adapt 
bench-scale studies into assays that are tractable for such large-scale experiments, and to use these assays to 
run screens. HTA capabilities also support non-HTS projects requiring the use of robotic liquid handling and 
plate readers. 
LCC members use a wide range of experimental systems and technical approaches in their research. HTA is 
therefore configured to develop and run assays ranging from fundamental biochemistry to cell-based studies 
involving high throughput confocal microscopy (known as high content screening or “HCS”). The facility 
maintains a suite of instruments for large-scale experiments that include advanced liquid handling platforms for 
nanoliter to microliter volumes, a diverse set of high-end photometric systems, and two different platforms for 
high-content screening (one of which is a new confocal instrument). The facility’s staff acquires and analyzes 
data from all instruments as a service, assists with experimental design, and trains researchers to use its 
analytical and acquisition software independently. Importantly, HTA is a fully-equipped conventional laboratory 
for cell and molecular biology with significant bench space and a newly renovated in-house tissue culture facility. 
Users can run complex experiments entirely in the facility. The number of LCC research groups supported by 
HTA instruments and services during the most recent one-year reporting period is more than double that reported 
in the previous CCSG renewal application. The increased usage of the facility corresponds to a significant 
expansion of its instrumentation, services and screening resources. This has included significant compound 
library acquisitions and newly developed capabilities for multiplexed and parallelized CRISRP/Cas9 screening 
for large scale functional analysis. HTA actively maintains a productive collaboration with ChemCore, speeding 
the cycle of lead optimization and ensuring that compound library selection maximizes the potential for medicinal 
chemistry with screening hits. Moreover, HTA works with the Developmental Therapeutics Core to develop new 
assays that use advanced tissue culture approaches."

10910993,"Wounds, which are breaks in structure and function of skin, are healed through a regulated process
initiated with tissue homeostasis followed by repair response involving inflammation, proliferation and
remodeling. Wounds may be due to cuts and lacerations or incisional wounds post surgeries. At times,
this healing is delayed or slowed resulting in chronic recalcitrant wounds. Risk factors for impaired
wound healing include surgical site infection and comorbidities such as aging, smoking, diabetes.
Strikingly, ongoing research with COVID19 patients showcased increased severity in wounds and
lesions compared to normal patients(1-4). Recalcitrant wounds per se are not life-threatening but often
lead to chronic wound related sequelae. The long-term outcome of impaired wound healing may lead
to scarring or amputations, and often has a substantial psychological impact. The treatment of
recalcitrant wounds and stimulation of healing is a critical need and consistent with priorities outlined
by Department of Veterans Affairs (2018-2024 Strategic plan). While multiple advances in wound
dressing materials promote healing, a noteworthy gap remains in the interventions available which
considerably improve the outcome of injury. Towards this goal, a therapeutic approach was
undertaken to harvest the potential of exosomes derived from human adipose stem cells (hASCexo)
mediating tissue repair and regeneration. Thus, the overarching hypothesis is that hASCexo enable
wound healing and recovery of function by modulating genomic pathways following injury. This
project will elucidate the safety and efficacy of hASC exosomes applied topically to repair dermal
wounds to move the therapy closer to the clinic. Towards this goal, the proposal will undertake an in
vitro evaluation of genomic targets complemented with an in vivo approach to determine response to
treatment. These hypotheses will be validated using a multi-disciplinary approach including pre-
clinical, physiological, cellular and biochemical experiments. Specific Aim 1: Determine the molecular
targets of the lncRNA cargo of hASC exosomes that promote wound healing: Using RNAseq to
examine the contents of hASC exosomes, two long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified which
are highly enriched in the hASCexo and are pivotal in recovery post injury. Human dermal fibroblasts
(HDF) and human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) will be used with siRNA mediated knockdown or
over-expression of these lncRNA in hASCexo. Cellular and biochemical outcomes will be measured
in in vitro wound models along with elucidation of genomic changes in response to hASCexo
treatment. These will be validated ex vivo in human skin explants. Specific Aim 2: Evaluation of
response to hASC exosomes’ treatment in an in vivo wound model: The hypothesis is that repair and
regeneration of wounds by topical application of hASCexo depends on its pharmacodynamics and
efficacy. To elucidate this along with its genomic impact, an in vivo rodent ischemic wound model will
be used to determine physiological response of hASCexo treatment to improve healing outcomes. Its
efficacy to promote healing in conditions of underlying infection will be evaluated
 The hASCexo provide a novel, cell-free regenerative approach to accelerate wound closure
and to alleviate chronic effects of impaired wound healing. Robust preliminary data supports feasibility
and successful implementation of hASC exosomes’ topical treatment in wound healing. The research
design is expected to greatly enhance translatability by the “learn and confirm” approach by integrating
the in vitro results in the in vivo model. The therapeutic potential of hASCexo will be thoroughly
evaluated for safety and scalability such that it may be translated successfully to the treatment of
Veterans’ wounds and substantially improve outcome of chronic wound related sequelae."
10910994,"Summary/Abstract
 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a widespread psychological disorder affecting ~7% population in the
U.S. The prevalence is even higher in veterans. It was estimated that approximately 30% of Operation
Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) veterans are affected by depression. Sexual
dimorphism in depression is well documented. Women and men differ in the prevalence, symptom
presentation, and responses to antidepressant treatment. However, the majority of scientific investigations
have been predominantly conducted in male models due to experimental limitations. Chronic social defeat
stress (CSDS) is one of the best-established models to study depression and has been largely limited to study
male depression. Recently, Dr. Russo's lab developed a female CSDS paradigm that consistently produced
depression-like behaviors in female mice and has since been adopted in our laboratory.
 Induction of inflammatory cytokines in the periphery contributes to depression-like behaviors both in
humans and in experimental models. Previously, it was found that stress-induced peripheral IL-6 plays an
important role in determining stress-susceptibility in male mice. Characterization of peripheral inflammation in
female mice following CSDS revealed positive correlation between stress-susceptibility and plasma levels of C-
C motif chemokine ligand (CCL5), but not with IL-6. Higher level of CCL5 was also reported in human subjects
with MDD and higher levels of peripheral CCL5 in women compared to men, implicating sexual dimorphic
interactions between CCL5 expression and depression. Gene expression analysis revealed that CCL5 receptor
CCR5 was significantly higher in stress-susceptible female mice in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a brain region
known to play important role in depression, and this increase was not seen in stress-susceptible male mice.
Cross-examination with human MDD RNA-seq data showed that in female MDD subjects, the level of CCR5 in
the ventromedial PFC was 2.8 fold higher compared to the control subjects and this increase was not seen in
male MDD subjects, suggesting conserved responses to stress in human and mouse.
 CCR5 is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor expressed in microglia, astrocytes and
neurons in diverse brain regions. Ligand activation of CCR5 has been show to suppress adenylyl cyclase,
activate PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling and alter intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, all of which can influence
synaptic function. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that in female mice, defeat stress induces
peripheral increase of CCL5 and its interaction with CCR5 in the brain dysregulates synaptic plasticity and
promotes stress-susceptibility. We propose to modulate CCL5 in the periphery or manipulate the CCL5/CCR5
signaling, either pharmacologically or genetically in the PFC, and use a battery of neurobehavioral tests,
immunological and molecular techniques to test the role of CCL5 and CCR5 in stress-susceptibility in females,
and compare the responses to male mice. We will also investigate whether stress-induced neurovascular
damage and associated blood brain barrier leakage may facilitate peripheral CCL5 infiltration to the brain.
Lastly we will investigate whether oral application of a FDA approved CCR5 antagonist is effective in treating
mice with depression-like phenotype and to compare its efficacy with antidepressant fluoxetine.
 We believe our approach will greatly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying
depression in female and fill the gap in current scientific knowledge on sex-specific periphery and central
mechanisms underlying depressive disorder. The treatment intervention proposed in the application will
provide immediate bench-to-bed translation and may significantly improve the health and lives of veterans
affected by the stress disorders including depression, anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorders
(PTSD), particularly relevant to the health and wellbeing of female veterans."
10910995,"Tobacco use disorder (TUD) remains the leading cause of preventable death in the world. Rates of cigarette
smoking are higher and cessation rates are lower in the veteran population in the United States compared to
the nonveteran population. Noninvasive neuromodulation holds promise as a therapeutic approach to TUD.
Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a noninvasive method to inhibit cortical and deep brain regions.
LIFU can reach deep brain regions and has spatial specificity. For smoking, one promising target to treat TUD
is the dorsal anterior insular cortex (dAI), a brain structure whose function is linked to the desire to smoke. The
insula is a critical brain region which is activated in the response to drug cue exposure and its extent of
activation is positively correlated with self-reported craving in human studies. Remarkably, humans with
damage to the insula were able to stop smoking easily and without experiencing cravings or relapse. LIFU can
selectively target the dAI and provides a potentially transformative method to reduce nicotine craving and
addiction. We will assess the safety and tolerability of LIFU to dAI in individuals with TUD. LIFU looks to have a
similar safety profile to other non-invasive methods though there is limited data for its use in clinical
populations and no data in substance use disorder. It is the purpose of this aim to produce a definitive multi-
modal dataset demonstrating that LIFU as a safe non-invasive treatment option. To do so, we will use
anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, neurological assessment, and patient query to assess the safety and
tolerability of LIFU. We will also explore smoking behavior 24 hours post LIFU to the dAI compared to that
delivered to the anatomic control site, the somatosensory cortex (S1) to determine whether there is a short-
term effect of 1 session of LIFU to dAI on smoking behavior. We will also inhibit the dAI with LIFU to determine
whether there is a causal role for the dAI in smoking cue induced craving and neural response in order to
understand the mechanism of cue induced craving in TUD which is a clinically important behavior which has
been associated with the severity of nicotine addiction. We propose to examine the effects of LIFU to left dAI
fMRI blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD) activity and craving in response to smoking cue exposure. To
achieve this, we will measure the effect of LIFU on 1) dAI compared to S1 blood-oxygen-level-dependent
(BOLD) activation in response to smoking (compared to neutral) cue exposure and 2) cue-induced craving in
individuals with TUD. We also plan to examine how LIFU to left dAI compared to S1 affects the temporal
dynamics of large-scale networks implicated in addiction. We will examine resting state functional connectivity
in the salience network (dAI- dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). We hypothesize that LIFU will reduce SN
connectivity and this reduction will be significantly correlated with the reduction in cue-induced craving.
Treatments for TUD have limited efficacy. There is a need in the veteran population for safe-effective
treatments for TUD. Selective inhibition of the dAI reduces craving, use and relapse in addiction animal
models and lesion of the insula dramatically abolishes use and craving of cigarette smoking in humans. LIFU
provides an ability to transiently and selectively inhibit this critical brain area to determine its causal role in TUD
which then may lead to approved treatments for TUD that could also be applied to other substance use
disorders."
10912079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) by even a few years could amass
substantial improvements in quality of life for individuals and families, independent living, and the cost of
specialized healthcare. Positive cognitive outcomes associated with physical activity interventions conducted in
middle-aged and older adults have increased the promise that primary prevention of ADRD may be achievable
via lifestyle change. It may take years to decades of adherence to health promoting behaviors to realize
appreciable gains in cognitive health span. Critically, while lifestyle interventions are supportive of behavior
change in the short-term, longer-term maintenance of cognitive health promoting behaviors (i.e. continued
enactment of these behaviors 6+ months after completion of the intervention) has proven difficult to achieve.
The current project will leverage an mHealth approach using commercially-available technology (smart
phones, wrist-worn activity monitors) to promote long-term maintenance of light intensity physical activity
(LIPA) in middle-aged adults at increased risk for ADRD (adults with obesity). Following a health education
session with a certified exercise physiologist, our approach will deliver the other intervention components:
adaptive daily step goal setting (both arms), self-monitoring (both arms), and interim goal setting every 2-3
hours (treatment arm-only), on study smart phones, over the course of participants daily lives. We aim to
demonstrate that the interim goal setting manipulation to the intervention can lead to greater long-term
maintenance of LIPA by keeping LIPA goals active in the focus attention during each day of the intervention
period and increasing LIPA self-efficacy through regular goal attainment. Goal maintenance (indicated by self-
monitoring frequency) will be quantified via participant interactions with custom-integrated Fitbit wrist-worn
activity monitors and the Mobile Monitoring of Cognitive Change (M2C2) component of the forthcoming NIH
Mobile Toolbox. Fitbits will be configured with a custom-designed clockface that displays accumulated step
counts when a ‘check my steps’ button is pressed. Logging and timestamping these interactions will allow for
quantification of self-monitoring frequency. We propose that development of these adherence-promoting
mechanisms (goal maintenance and self-efficacy) can act as a self-regulatory scaffold from which long-term
health promotion gains can be realized. The current project will: 1) demonstrate the ability of interim goal
setting to engage our proposed adherence-promoting targets (Aim 1); 2) test the efficacy of the interim goal
setting manipulation to increase short- and long-term LIPA maintenance following the intervention through goal
maintenance and increased self-efficacy (Aim 2); 3) examine how variation in cognition influences the ability of
the intervention to engage goal maintenance (Aim 3); 4) explore the long-term salutary effects of the
intervention on cognitive (change in ADRD risk) and physical health (change in weight, V02-max; Aim 4)."
10912505,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is the most commonly diagnosed inherited optic neuropathy.
Mutations in the OPA1 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase, account for 60-70% of all
DOA cases. Although OPA1 is expressed throughout the body, secondary to dysfunctional mitochondria,
patients with DOA associated OPA1 mutations exhibit loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) specifically. Despite
intensive study and the availability of mouse models of DOA, critical questions regarding how OPA1 mutations
lead to specific loss of human RGCs in DOA patients remain unanswered and there are currently no
treatments for this condition. A human RGC model would greatly facilitate the study of disease mechanisms as
well as drug discovery efforts. Obtaining RGCs from DOA patient samples is not feasible, however, due to the
rarity of DOA donor eyes, the sparsity of RGCs in the human retina, and poor RGC viability upon isolation. The
proposed studies will address this unmet need by developing and characterizing in detail three human
pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models of DOA that track disease progress from stem cell differentiation to RGC
degeneration. An important feature of our stem cell models is that they make use of techniques that produce
large quantities of highly purified RGCs that display long term survival, features important for biochemical,
functional, morphological, and transcriptomic analyses. We combined this protocol with CRISPR/Cas9

degeneration. In the future, these well-characterized stem cell models could be used for large-sale functional
genomics studies and high throughput screening for neuroprotective and regenerative agents."

Despite advances in treatment options, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in women. Identifying key signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression is necessary for
developing new approaches to target breast cancer. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors
(FGFR) are activated in human breast cancers across subtypes and contribute to breast cancer progression
via both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The focus of this proposal is to define identify novel
mechanisms through which FGFR activation in breast cancer cells contributes to pro-tumorigenic alterations
in the tumor microenvironment, which contribute to breast cancer progression. To this end, we have focused
on identifying 1) novel transcriptional targets of FGF/FGFR signaling in breast cancer cells and 2) their
impact on the stromal environment. Using a model of FGFR-driven mammary tumor growth and progression,
we have generate preliminary data that link FGF/FGFR activation in tumor cells with de novo cholesterol
synthesis and accumulation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that cholesterol accumulation in tumor cells
promotes the generation of an immunosuppressive macrophage population. Although the FGF/FGFR axis
has been shown to regulate metabolic functions in some physiological contexts, the link between FGF/FGFR
and cholesterol metabolism has not been investigated in the cancer. The studies described in this proposal
will test the hypothesis that activation of FGFR in breast cancer cells drives cholesterol metabolism in tumor
cells and that these alterations contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Studies proposed in
Specific Aim 1 will the mechanisms by which FGF/FGFR activation in breast cancer cells drives cholesterol
accumulation and storage. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will examine the impact of FGFR-driven cholesterol
metabolism on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, studies in Specific Aim 3 will use spatial transcriptomics
and multiplex imaging techniques to identify links between FGF/FGFR and cholesterol metabolism in human
breast cancers. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to FGFR-driven alterations in cholesterol
metabolism in tumor cells and subsequent impacts on the tumor microenvironment will lead to novel
therapeutic approaches that target malignant alterations within both the tumor cell and the stroma, leading to
enhanced therapeutic efficacy."
10912515,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Clonal blood differentiation through the acquisition of somatic mutations result in abnormal accumulation of
blood components and clinically manifest as myeloid disorders. The study of how these somatic mutations
perturb the differentiation trajectories in human hematopoiesis is often challenged by the admixture of normal
hematopoietic cells with the neoplastic cells that cannot be distinguished by cell surface markers. To
overcome this limitation, we developed a novel single-cell multi-omics Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT)
platform that directly links somatic genotypes with transcriptomes of thousands of single cells. Thus, GoT
enabled the comparison of mutant and wildtype cells within the same sample in the context of progenitor
identities, thereby turning the co-mingling of mutant and wildtype hematopoiesis from a limitation to an
advantage. As proof of principle, GoT was applied to CD34+ progenitor cells from patients with calreticulin-
mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), revealing key pathways that were aberrantly activated in the
mutant cells, such as a robust unfolded protein response in the megakaryocytic progenitors, on the one
way, and NF-KB pathway in stem cell-enriched populations, on the other. Overall, GoT revealed that the
transcriptional impact of calreticulin mutations is highly variable as a function of progenitor identity – which
bears significant implications for therapy by enabling the discovery of targetable pathways specific to the
earliest stem cells. Thus, to demonstrate the cell identity-dependency across other key driver mutations, as
a fundamental concept in myeloid disorders, I will apply GoT to thrombopoietin receptor-mutated progenitor
cells and to clonally-diverse cells from MPN samples (Aim 1). Next, in order to define cell extrinsic
determinants of somatic mutation impact, I will determine the immune niche interactions with calreticulin-mutant
and wildtype progenitor cells, as well as the impact of immunomodulatory therapy on these interactions (Aim
2). Finally, I will test the hypothesis that the cell’s epigenome precedes the cell identity-dependency of
somatic mutation effects, by developing and applying a novel single-cell platform that integrates somatic
genotyping with chromatin accessibility states of progenitor cells (Aim 3). Thus, I will define the genetic,
epigenetic, transcriptional and environmental factors that culminate in the clinical output of somatic mutations
in human hematopoiesis. These studies will, therefore, unveil not only fundamental concepts in clonal
hematopoietic differentiation but also specific targets for therapeutic intervention."

Cells have a remarkable capacity to self-assemble into organ-like structures in vitro. However,
current in vitro-derived organs lack proper size and higher-order patterning, features that require
organism-level information not present in a dish. Notably, the collective polarization and
unidirectional alignment of cells across a tissue, a phenomenon known as planar cell polarity
(PCP), is lacking in vitro organs, yet is essential for proper organ formation and function. Thus, to
fulfill the promise of tissue engineering to generate functional organs in vitro we must understand
how cells establish long-range collective polarization.
 We have established the murine skin as a model system to investigate the multiscale
coordination of PCP in an expansive and regenerative tissue. By developing methods to perform
ex vivo culturing, long-term live imaging, biophysical perturbations, and organotypic reconstitution
of the epidermis, we have made key new discoveries about PCP establishment at the tissue,
cellular and molecular scales. We discovered that uniaxial tissue deformation acts as a symmetry
breaking cue that defines the major axis of PCP alignment in the epidermis. We further showed
that that primary keratinocytes grown in the absence of global cues establish spontaneous, locally
aligned domains of planar polarity de novo. Through super-resolution imaging and mapping the
adhesive interactions of PCP components, we identified a role for cadherin-mediated cis-
interactions in the clustering and sorting of asymmetric PCP complexes.
 The broad goal of this work is to build on these previous discoveries and technological
developments to decipher how PCP is organized across different biological length scales. Using
the mammalian skin epidermis as a model system, Specific Aim 1 will determine how long-range
mechanical cues bias and align planar cell polarity across the epidermis. Specific Aim 2 will
investigate the mechanisms by which cells skin cells spontaneously generate PCP through self-
organization. Specific Aim 3 will decipher the nanoscale architecture and biochemical
interactions of PCP complexes. Using technical innovations recently developed in my laboratory
to perform live and super-resolution imaging of endogenously-tagged PCP proteins in both native
and organotypic tissues, this work will provide fundamental new insights into the multiscale
coordination of PCP."
10912645,"The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) following acute respiratory and myocardial failure is the leading
cause of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Over 90% of MV pediatric patients receive
continuous sedation, most commonly with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist benzodiazepines.
Recently, we demonstrated that exposure to the benzodiazepine midazolam contributed to iatrogenic harm in
pediatric patients—prolonging PICU length of stay and increasing the prevalence and duration of delirium.
Delirium, itself a manifestation of acute brain dysfunction, is prevalent in the PICU with rates of up to 30% in
older children, over 50% in infants and toddlers, and over 60% in pediatric patients requiring MV. Delirium in
children is a significant contributor to longer duration on MV, prolonged PICU length of stay, and death, with
significant consequential costs. Adult studies have shown that an alternative sedation paradigm using
dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, decreases the duration of delirium and coma, length of MV, ICU length
of stay, cost, and infection rates compared to benzodiazepine-based sedation. Dexmedetomidine has unique
anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant characteristics, making it an appealing sedative agent as inflammation,
endothelial and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury are mechanistically associated with prolonged delirium and
worse cognitive impairment in adults. Though sedation may be unavoidable in PICUs, a dexmedetomidine-
based regimen may complement goal-directed sedation, as over-sedation (30%) rather than under-sedation
(10%) is common in the PICU setting, and thus far, sedation protocolization alone have not demonstrated
significant impact on improving outcomes in pediatric patients. The FDA recently published warnings regarding
the possible role of anesthetics, including benzodiazepines, on cognitive development in children. We
therefore propose mini-MENDS (Maximizing the Efficacy of Goal-Directed Sedation to Reduce
Neurological Dysfunction in Mechanically Ventilated Infants and Children Study), in which we will test the
hypotheses that sedation of MV pediatric patients with an alpha-2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) versus a GABA-
ergic agent (midazolam) will (Aim 1A) decrease daily delirium prevalence, (Aim 1B) decrease length of MV,
(Aim 2A) improve functional and behavioral recovery, (Aim 2B) be associated with fewer symptoms of post-
traumatic stress, (Aim 2C) decrease the incidence of cognitive impairment, and (Aim 3) reduce levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers of endothelial and blood brain barrier injury. We will randomize 372
pediatric patients on MV, aged 6 months to 11 years, to receive goal-directed continuous sedation with either
dexmedetomidine or midazolam for up to 10 days. The study will have 80% power to detect at least a 10%
absolute reduction in daily delirium prevalence between groups, this a clinically meaningful outcome;
extrapolation of current pediatric data would estimate a 10% decrease in delirium prevalence to be
associated with a 1.2-day (20%) decrease in PICU LOS and 15% lower odds of dying."

Circadian rhythms, our 24 daily biological rhythms, control nearly all our basic biological functions and are
sensitive to the environment. Directing both environmental and pharmacological interventions at disrupted
circadian rhythms has untapped potential to treat many conditions including cancer, psychiatric conditions, and
cardiometabolic disorders. We first need, however, to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in
circadian rhythms, particularly those linking the human circadian system to downstream disorders. Human
genetics can provide insights important to address this gap in knowledge.
The overall vision of this research program is understanding the underlying mechanisms of the human
circadian system and its role in human health leading to integration of the temporal axis of our biology into
preventative clinical care and treatment using a multifaceted and innovative approach. My research program
spans from genetic discovery to functional follow-up to translational applications with the goals for the next five
years to 1) use existing biobanks to identify individuals with extreme circadian behavior for rare variant studies
resulting in identification of genes and pathways involved in circadian rhythms; 2) develop scalable human
circadian phenotyping methods to enable detailed investigations of circadian behavior in large-scale populations
well-powered for genetic studies; and 3) create novel circadian function follow-up cellular assays with the
potential to interrogate the impact of gene knock out in a variety of environmental and genetic backgrounds and
pair this novel functional screen with drosophila behavioral assays of circadian behavior.
I am well-positioned to lead this research program as my background is in human genetics with experience in
circadian rhythms and cellular screens for downstream functional assays with a proven-track record of success.
As well, I have current and future collaborators positioned to contribute their expertise to this research program,
with specific expertise in population genetic studies, circadian phenotyping in humans, and cellular circadian
assays.
Expected outcomes are: 1) genes, pathways, and cell types that contribute to circadian physiology particularly
mechanisms beyond the core molecular circadian clock; 2) Tools for circadian risk prediction and stratification
with utility in the workplace, educational environments, and clinical care; 3) Easy to implement and dynamic
circadian phenotyping for research and clinical use across a broad range of study and care; and 4) Novel
pharmaceutical targets for circadian rhythm disorders and causally linked disorders. These findings will allow
for the development of novel therapeutics for rare circadian rhythms disorders and increase our understanding
of the basic mechanisms of circadian biology in humans, and ultimately shed light on how circadian rhythm
dysregulation predisposes to more common associated neuropsychiatric and cardiometabolic diseases."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of adult mortality and health inequity in the U.S, with
African Americans carrying a significantly higher risk for CVD compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Given that
disparities in risk factors for CVD development are already present in childhood, there is a large public health
need for research on factors that can contribute to CVD risk disparities among youth. Notably, exposure to racial
discrimination leads to increased risk of cardiovascular events and CVD among African Americans. Furthermore,
among African American youth, racial discrimination predicted elevated levels of inflammation in adulthood.
However, up to this point, research on racial discrimination and CVD risk has focused on individual-level
experiences of racial discrimination, while more broad-ranging aspects of structural racism have been
understudied. Structural racism, defined as the macrolevel systems and social forces that impact inequities
among racial groups, includes issues related to education, employment, housing, and law enforcement. One
previous study identified that individuals living in states with higher structural racism had higher rates of
myocardial infarction, highlighting a need for more research in this area. Examining the relationship between
structural racism and biobehavioral processes involved in early CVD progression among African American youth
has potential to provide significant impacts in terms of the prevention of CVD in future work.
 To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed project aims to assess how structural racism may
be associated with CVD risk among African American youth and young adults. Using neighborhood-based
indicators of structural racism (i.e., neighborhood-level racial disparities in education, employment, housing, and
law enforcement) from publicly available data, the research will 1) examine the association between structural
racism and cardiometabolic health, reflected by signs of metabolic syndrome and endothelial function, among
African American youth and young adults over time, 2) examine the association between structural racism and
another marker of CVD risk, inflammation, among African American youth and young adults over time, and 3)
test inflammation as a mediator between structural racism and cardiometabolic health among African American
youth and young adults over time. The research will utilize two studies, including the sponsor’s R01 data and the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to determine whether findings replicate and generalize.
 The proposed research is part of a broader post-doctoral training program, whose goal is to prepare the
applicant for a career as a PI at a major research university, focused on understanding disparities related to CVD
pathogenesis in youth. In addition to the research outlined above, the applicant will complete coursework on the
pathophysiology of CVD, immunology, statistical methods, and adolescent health disparities, gain experience
measuring inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers, and develop a knowledge base about analyzing large-
scale neighborhood-level data to better understand the social environment contributors to CVD disparities."
10913401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia induced by hemodilution and the extracorporeal circuit
itself, children supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are at significant risk of
bleeding. In order to prevent bleeding, pediatric intensivists often prescribe prophylactic platelet
transfusions. However, in observational studies, prophylactic platelet transfusions to children on ECMO
have been independently associated with increased thrombosis, mortality, and paradoxically, increased
bleeding. Guidelines to direct platelet transfusions in this patient population are limited by the lack of
evidence and therefore based on expert opinion alone. Given the significant associated risks, it is crucial
to provide evidence to guide clinicians.
 The ECmo hemoSTAtic Transfusions In Children (ECSTATIC) pilot trial, endorsed by BloodNet,
PediECMO, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) and the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and
Sepsis Investigators (PALISI), will be conducted in ten sites. Non-bleeding children 0-18 years of age will
be randomized 1:1 to either a platelet transfusion threshold of 90 (liberal transfusion strategy) or 50 x109/L
(restrictive transfusion strategy). They will be followed until they progress to severe bleeding or thrombosis,
they are decannulated from ECMO or they reach 21 days. In this pilot, we will test the separation between
the restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies, the feasibility of patient enrollment, and the ability of an
adjudication committee to determine the severity of bleeding and thrombotic outcomes.
 The proposed pilot trial is innovative in that it is focused on children supported by ECMO, a
population in whom transfusion strategies have never been tested previously; it involves the largest
separation between the two arms of any platelet transfusion trial conducted in the past; and it involves two
newly developed definitions of bleeding and thrombosis particularly applicable to children supported by
ECMO.
 The R34 pilot trial will provide necessary and sufficient information to proceed with the definitive
ECSTATIC RCT to evaluate the impact of a restrictive prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold on the
clinical outcomes in children on ECMO. ECSTATIC has the potential to decrease mortality and morbidity
of these extremely ill infants and children."

Nanotechnology-Based Treatment of Carcinoma in Situ of the Oral Cavity (Stage 0 Oral Cancer)”
Project Summary:
According to the American Cancer Society, about 54,000 people in the US will be newly diagnosed with oral
cancer (OC) in 2022, causing 11,230 deaths. Historically, OC has been present in heavy smokers and drinkers,
however OC has also become more prevalent in younger populations due to human papillomavirus (HPV).
Survivors must manage devastating lifelong side effects of treatments which can lead to permanent psychological
damage and physical disfigurement. The diminished quality of life is due to the permanent physical disabilities
resulting from surgery, the first-line treatment regardless of stage. These include permanent speech impairment,
an inability to swallow, and/or the loss of the jawbone due to the surgical removal of the tongue and other oral
tissue. The long-term costs associated with the treatment and these disabilities can range from $100,000-
$250,000, resulting in oral cancer persisting as one of the most expensive of all cancers to treat.
To address this unmet need, Privo Technologies has developed a topical chemotherapy patch, PRV111, capable
of transmucosal drug delivery that is applied directly to the tumor. PRV111 consists of a mucoadhesive polymeric
patch with embedded cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles and a non-permeable backing that facilitates unidirectional
drug release, maintaining locoregional control of the drug application to the tumor site. Cisplatin is recognized as
the gold standard chemotherapeutic agent for treating oral cancer, however its efficacy is often hindered by
significant systemic toxicity resulting from traditional systemic intravenous (IV) administration. PRV111
capitalizes on cisplatin’s cytotoxicity, without systemic side effects, through the localized delivery. The PRV111
nanoparticles are optimized to ensure that cisplatin is locally retained within the tumor tissue and not exposed to
systemic bodily circulation. PRV111 has been investigated in a phase 1/2 trial in patients with early-stage OC.
The trial met all safety and efficacy primary endpoints, with PRV111 having an 87% overall response rate with
an average tumor reduction of 70% in 5.5 days of treatment and labs demonstrating no cisplatin in patient blood.
The goal of this proposal is to support the successful completion of Privo’s Phase 3 clinical trial in Stage 0
OC/Carcinoma in situ (CIS). The goal of this trial is to eliminate the need for standard of care surgical resection
by offering PRV111 as a chemoablative alternative. Surgery for CIS carries high degrees of functional and
cosmetic morbidity, as these tumors are often shallow and widespread necessitating large amount of tissue to be
removed. Data from the previous clinical trial demonstrated that PRV111 was able to chemoablate the epithelium
in all treated patients, so the Company is confident that CIS can be eliminated. The success of the Phase 3 clinical
trial would position Privo and the PRV platform to be sustained through revenue streams from the approved
PRV111, followed by supplemental NDA submissions and label expansion into further indications. Privo’s team
of scientists, business leaders, and collaborators can execute its defined aims with milestones and deliverables."

 Enabling High-Throughput Analysis and Single-Cell Imaging of Bacterial Signals
Our research aims to understand how bacteria perceive chemical signals to regulate different behaviors. We
have invented different types of biosensors to rapidly measure key signaling molecules in bacteria, including one
for cyclic di-GMP. This signal controls whether bacteria attach to surfaces, form sticky biofilms, and secrete
toxins. One of our major goals is to identify nutrients, other chemicals, and environmental inputs that change
cyclic di-GMP levels in different bacteria. We recently demonstrated a successful approach that combines
structure-based bioinformatics analysis and experimental screening. However, the discovery of primary inputs
remains challenging because each bacterium harbors many cyclic di-GMP signaling enzymes, the signal is
transiently produced, highly charged, and low in abundance, and the screening method remains a key bottleneck.
Thus, this proposal will develop next-generation fluorescent biosensors to enhance high-throughput, quantitative
screening of enzyme activity directly in cells (Aim 2). These biosensors then will be applied to discover primary
inputs for a widespread small molecule binding domain associated with cyclic di-GMP and other signaling
enzymes (Aim 3). In addition, towards understanding environmental factors that regulate cyclic di-GMP, this
proposal will develop a new type of biosensor to perform in situ imaging of cyclic di-GMP in biofilms (Aim 3). In
the long term, this project aims to inform personalized diets to treat inflammatory bowel diseases and promote
gut health.
For this renewal of the project, the original scope also has been expanded to study the permeability of small
molecules into bacterial cells. The permeability process includes passive permeation, active uptake, and active
efflux mechanisms, and is critical to bacterial growth, signaling, and antibiotic resistance. This proposal will
develop a high-throughput assay that enables real-time monitoring of small molecule permeability in cells (Aim
1). The assay will be applied to understand both the molecular structures and genetic factors that affect
accumulation of fluorescent dyes and of clinical antibiotics inside cells. In the long term, this new aim will improve
chemical biology tools that use these dyes and antibiotics treatments."

As HD progresses, it affects other parts of the brain and the peripheral tissues. The mechanisms underlying the neuronal vulnerability in HD are not entirely understood and likely several, including aggregation, transcriptional dysregulation, energy metabolism deficits, synaptic dystrophy, oxidative stress, inflammation, and others. We demonstrated that striatal enriched protein Rhes interacts with mHTT via the farnesylation domain and promotes cellular toxicity by increasing the soluble forms of mHTT via small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 modification.

and functions are largely unknown. We and others have previously shown that astrocytes modulate specific
neural circuit formation, function and plasticity by several secreted proteins including hevin (SPARCL1),

(vesicular glutamate transporter 2) thalamocortical connections, TSPs facilitate VGlut1+ synapse formation.
Intriguingly, expression of these synaptogenic proteins is developmentally regulated and are also altered in brain

decipher the mechanistic link between levels of S1P and the expression of SPARCL1 and TSP4 and clarify on
the fundamental role of S1P/S1PR1 axis in the developing and diseased brain. This proposal thus is poised to

Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is an HIV/AIDS-associated malignancy, that remains prevalent, despite antiretroviral
therapy, in areas where there is high incidence of KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. KSHV
seroprevalence is geographically uneven but is high in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and in parts of the United
States, such as Southern Louisiana, where HIV-1 infection rates are high. In this region, both HIV and KS
disproportionately affect people of color who also experience other health disparities. Because HIV- and KSHV-
infected individuals remain at risk to develop KS and other KSHV-associated malignances despite HIV viral load
suppression, novel research strategies are needed for people living with HIV (PLWH). Chronic oncogenic viral
infections possess mechanisms that engender immune avoidance and viral persistence that leads to neoplastic
growth. The KSHV latency locus encodes a small number of viral genes that are involved in viral persistence.
The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) plays a key role in the maintenance of latency and help the virus
to evade host immune surveillance by inhibiting MHC-1 antigen presentation, while other latency genes, such
as kaposin (K12) was reported to have oncogenic properties, as well as microRNAs that could be essential for
tumorigenesis. Although the individual function of KSHV latency-associated genes have been studied, there
remain unresolved questions regarding their specific contribution to latency, immune evasion and neoplasia. It
is also critical to know, which host genes and pathways interact with the viral genes to elicit the latency program,
and to answer how this virus-host interplay contributes to malignant transformation. We recently demonstrated
that our unique CRISPR/Cas9 vector, specifically designed to target a single KSHV LANA nucleotide sequence,
reduced ~70-80% of KSHV episomal copies, and attenuated the growth of KSHV-positive cells. Our major
objective here is to utilize this new technology to disrupt/eliminate multiple genes of the KSHV latency locus, and
to investigate their individual and combined effects on KSHV latency. We will seek to identify cellular genes and
pathways affected by, and possibly contributing to the development and maintenance of the malignant
phenotype. We hypothesize that the components of the KSHV latency locus individually dysregulate expression
of specific sets of cellular genes to promote KSHV persistence and synergistically to promote growth
dysregulation and tumorigenesis. We will test this concept by editing multiple viral gene sequences within the
latency locus with CRISPR/Cas9 using KS and PEL cell culture models. Through bioinformatics analyses of
transcriptome profiles of the CRISPR/Cas9 edited KSHV infected cells, we will identify unique host genes/cellular
pathway and their roles/interaction with viral latency genes in viral latency, growth dysregulation and
tumorigenesis."

Detecting various compositionally similar but structurally distinct glycans present in heterogenous mixtures has
traditionally been challenging due to the limitations facing current glycomics approaches. These limitations have
hindered our understanding of the availability and abundance of individual glycans in the mammalian gut
environment, which is replete with diverse mixtures of microbial, mammalian, and plant-derived oligo- and
polysaccharides. Moreover, the intestinal glycan composition is a primary driver of gut microbiome composition
and metabolism, which represents an increasingly important human health determinant, and necessitates a deep
understanding of the glycomic-microbial interface to identify important biological interactions and putatively
develop glycan-derived therapeutics to target specific microbial activities. Therefore, new tools are necessary to
detect and measure the relative abundance of individual glycan substrates present in the heterogenous mixtures
prepared from biological sources such as mammalian intestinal contents. We have harnessed the glycan
detection machinery employed by dominant members of the gut microbiota to detect, measure and isolate
individual glycan substrates present in heterogenous mixtures extracted from the mammalian intestine. Herein,
we demonstrate robust, specific, and scalable approaches by which engineered microbes report the presence
of individual glycan substrates with incredible sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can
accurately measure the abundance of individual glycans present in mixtures across wide linear ranges and that
the specificity and sensitivity of these measurements can be tuned by modifying particular microbial glycan
utilization genes. Finally, we demonstrate that microbially-encoded glycan-binding proteins can be used to isolate
individual target glycans from mixtures for downstream compositional and structural determination. We propose
to 1.) develop arrayed libraries of distinct gut microbial species, each engineered to report the presence of unique
target glycans, 2.) develop a rapid glycan isolation pipeline to purify individual substrates of interest for
downstream structural and functional characterization, and 3.) develop genetically modified microbial strains with
enhanced sensitivity or target specificity. In addition to offering a rapid and inexpensive alternative to quantifying
known glycans, we believe that further development of these tools will reveal the presence and abundance of
previously undetectable glycans and dramatically enhance our understanding of the interactions between gut
microbes and their mammalian hosts."
10914062,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-intensity drinking (HID; 8+/10+ drinks for females/males) is a distinct form of excessive alcohol use that
results in significant, even life-threatening, physical and psychological consequences. Fifteen percent of young
adults have engaged in HID in the past two weeks, and this form of drinking most often occurs in social
settings. Characteristics of the drinking context (e.g. alcohol availability, demographic composition of the event)
are associated with levels of alcohol consumption; however, current interventions for young adult alcohol
misuse do not address real-time risk factors in the drinking context. The proposed Mentored Research
Scientist Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Cox with the training and mentorship to become an
independent behavioral scientist focused on the prevention of young adult alcohol misuse. The objective of the
proposed research is to identify risk factors in the immediate drinking context for HID among young adults and
use this information to develop and pilot test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that addresses the
identified risk factors to reduce HID and associated consequences. To achieve her long-term career goals, Dr.
Cox requires additional training. This K01 will provide the necessary support for Dr. Cox to pursue the following
scientific training objectives: (1) obtain skills in the design of mHealth intervention approaches, (2) execute
experimental designs to test interventions for young adult alcohol misuse, (3) gain proficiency in priority
selection of behavior change techniques for intervention strategies, and (4) enrich statistical capacities in the
analysis of intensive longitudinal data. These objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan that
consists of one-on-one meetings, didactics/trainings, mentor-directed readings, seminars/lab meetings,
scientific meetings, and hands-on research experience. To support these goals, Dr. Cox has a mentoring team
comprised of leading researchers in all of these areas that each have a record of successful NIH-funded
research and extensive mentoring experience. Skills gained through the training plan will be put into action
through the execution of the complementary research plan. Aim 1 is to determine JITAI decision points by
identifying factors in the drinking context that are uniquely associated with HID via a 4-week study using
ecological momentary assessment with 50 young adults (ages 18-24). Aim 2 is to iteratively develop a JITAI
that addresses identified risk factors to prevent HID among this population. Aim 3 is to pilot test the JITAI to a)
assess its feasibility and acceptability, and b) explore preliminary effects on HID. This research is consistent
with NIAAA’s initiative to develop effective prevention strategies that address the risks for consequences that
result from excessive drinking or other forms of alcohol misuse. The proposed study will provide data for Dr.
Cox’s first R01 proposal, to be submitted in the final year of this proposed award."
10914183,"Ferroptosis, Cellular Metabolism, and Cancer
Abstract
 Ferroptosis is a form of non-apoptotic cell death driven by cellular metabolism and iron-dependent lipid
peroxidation. Although the physiological role of ferroptosis remains elusive, mounting evidence has established
that ferroptosis impacts various pathological processes, including cancer. This competitive renewal proposal is
built upon what we have achieved during the previous funding cycle and aims to further elucidate the molecular
basis of ferroptosis, its interplay with metabolism, and its role in cancer. In the previous funding period, we found
that multiple cellular metabolic pathways, such as autophagy, glutaminolysis, and strikingly, the normal metabolic
activity of mitochondria, contribute to ferroptotic death. We also found that the CDH1-NF2-Hippo-YAP and PI3K-
AKT-mTOR-SREBP signaling pathways, both highly relevant to cancer, regulate ferroptosis through modulating
cellular iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Moreover, via a whole genome CRISPR/cas9-activation screen,
we identified several lipid modifying enzymes as novel ferroptosis suppressors, further underscoring the intimate
relationship between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis. Importantly, our TCGA analysis indicates overexpression
of one of these enzymes, MBOAT2, predicts poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including liver cancer,
bladder cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Based on these preliminary results, the central
hypothesis of the grant is that lipid modification regulates cancer cell metabolism, invasiveness, and ferroptosis,
through modulating cellular lipid storage and membrane composition; and targeting MBOAT2 in combination
with ferroptosis induction holds cancer therapeutic potential. To investigate this hypothesis and to define the
underlying mechanisms, we will tackle following questions. First, what is the mechanism by which these lipid
modifiers protect cells fromferroptosis,do they dictate lipid peroxidation viaaltering specific phospholipidspecies,
and do they communicate with SREBP, a master transcriptional regulator of lipogenesis and a potent ferroptosis
suppressor (Aim-1)? Second, do these lipid modifiers modulate cellular properties such as cellular storage of
lipids as energy source and plasma membrane plasticity? As these cellular properties impact cancer cell
invasive/metastatic capability, metabolism, and likely redox homeostasis, is there a functional interplay between
ferroptosis and these cancer-relevant cellular processes (Aim-2)? Third and directly relevant to cancer treatment
(Aim-3), by using patient-derived tumor organoids, xenograft mouse models, and genetically engineered mouse
models (GEMM), we will investigate how our newly-identified ferroptosis suppressors modulate tumorigenesis,
metastasis and the responsiveness of cancer cells to ferroptosis induction, and assess whether the combination
of MBOAT2 inhibition with ferroptosis induction can be an effective therapy for the treatment of cancer in which
MBOAT2 overexpression predicts poor prognosis (we will focus on PDAC in this proposal). Success of the
proposed study will lead to an in-depth mechanistic understanding of ferroptosis and its interplay with cellular
metabolism, and provide insights into the development of novel, mechanism-based cancer therapies."

The Yale Medical Scientist Training Program proposes to train rigorous, visionary and resilient physician-
scientists who are committed to improving the health of individuals and populations. Our mission is to provide
students with integrated training in clinical medicine and research that qualifies them to perform at the highest
standards as rigorous clinicians and scientists; to create a diverse and inclusive physician-scientist community
to support and mentor trainees along axes of personal identity, clinical discipline and research domain; to
cultivate the characteristics of curiosity, creativity, compassion and service in our trainees; and to develop skills
associated with success in a broad range of physician-scientist research careers through experiential learning.
The MSTP training plan integrates clinical and research training, allowing students to experience the
integration of medicine and science that characterizes the physician-scientist career. Built upon the strong
foundation of Yale School of Medicine and the departments, programs and faculty of Yale’s Graduate School
of Arts and Sciences, School of Public Health, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the MD-PhD
program trains students in the responsible conduct of research across a diversity of disciplines and provides
experiential training in the design, execution and presentation of rigorous and reproducible research.
We are committed to increasing diversity of matriculated students along axes of race/ethnicity, geography,
socioeconomic status and undergraduate institution. Intentional changes to our recruitment and holistic review
processes have already increased the proportion of URiM students in our MD-PhD Program. Activities that
build an inclusive MD-PhD community are embedded in School- and University-wide programs that support
and promote trainees and faculty from groups underrepresented in medicine and science; these help to retain
our students in dual-degree training. Our program prepares MD-PhD students for the challenges of a
physician-scientist career, while opportunities to work with physician-scientists in medical and surgical
disciplines in- and out-side of academia expose students to many careers that make use of the dual-degree.
Our training plan proposes the following outcomes: 1) A continued increase in the diversity of our
matriculants and graduates and ongoing commitment to training scholars in traditional and non-traditional PhD
disciplines relevant to human health and disease. 2) Mentoring and training that allows 100% of our students to
publish high-quality, rigorous, original work that reflects their skills and independence in research. 3) Provision
of skills and motivation to support research-intensive physician-scientist careers, such that >85% of graduates
engage in research during residency/fellowship training and >75% of their attempts to fund science are
successful. And last, we aspire to match the success of Yale’s 1st 50 years of MD-PhD training by having
>75% of our graduates remain engaged in research during their careers."
10914315,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Life-saving advances in medical care in recent decades have reduced global mortality rates but have
underperformed in addressing maternal mortality, stillbirth, and neonatal mortality. A key reason for these
disparities in both low- and high-income settings is the lack of systematic screening with appropriate and
affordable) technology for high priority conditions such as maternal hypertension and preeclampsia and fetal
growth restriction. The development of new low-cost diagnostic tools to improve access to detection of these
conditions by front-line workers would change outcomes for the most underserved populations, which is our
long-term goal. In an NICHD-funded study, we collected point of care Doppler ultrasound recordings and
developed a preliminary machine learning approach for detecting intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and
maternal hypertension. The overall objective of this proposal is to prospectively validate these findings in two
large underserved pregnancy cohorts in rural Guatemala and urban Georgia. Our general hypothesis is that our
low-cost artificial intelligence will perform as well in detecting maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, and IUGR
as standard-of-care high-cost diagnostic approaches. In Aim 1, we will validate our ultrasound-based IUGR
detection algorithm against the standard of care (2-dimensional fetal imaging). In Aim 2, we will validate
maternal hypertension and preeclampsia algorithms against gold-standard blood pressure devices and clinical
risk prediction tools. In Aim 3, we will implement real-time versions of the algorithms validated in Aims 1 and
2 and implement them on an edge-computing system for field testing. Successful completion of this proposal will
result in a novel and cost-effective approach to screening for maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, and IUGR
using point-of-care Doppler connected to a low-cost, AI-enabled edge-computing system, suitable for wide use
in low-resource settings. This proposal is innovative because it uses an artificial intelligence approach and
widely-available point-of-care Doppler devices to provide new approaches to timely detection of high-impact
maternal-fetal conditions. Our results will provide a strong basis for wide-scale deployment of new maternal and
fetal screening technology which is expected to have a significant impact on maternal and fetal morbidity by
improving access to timely screening. This research aligns with the NICHD's mission to advance knowledge of
pregnancy, fetal development, and birth by promoting strategies that prevent maternal, infant, and childhood
mortality and morbidity through lost-cost high-impact screening technology."
10914371,"Project Summary
Women are disproportionally affected by Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias
(AD/ADRD) with approximately two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with this condition being women. Studies
have revealed substantial sex and gender disparities in AD/ADRD care and outcomes, with women being less
likely to receive annual blood pressure and weight monitoring, and more likely to experience delayed initiation
of anti-dementia medication than men. Despite a growing body of literature documenting sex and gender
disparities in AD/ADRD care, research on underlying causes of these disparities remains limited. Research on
healthcare in general (not focusing on AD/ADRD care) indicates that patient-physician gender concordance,
gender diversity of physicians' training environments, and health system board diversity are associated with
the care quality and outcomes. However, their impact on sex and gender disparities in AD/ADRD care has not
been investigated. The proposed study will address this important knowledge gap by analyzing the nationally-
representative data on patients, physicians, medical schools, residency programs, and health systems, that will
be developed by linking 5 nationally-representative databases (Medicare Claims Data, Doximity Physician
Data, Association of American Medical Colleges Medical School Data, American Medical Association
Residency Program Data, and American Hospital Association National Health Care Governance Survey Data).
In Aim 1, using this comprehensive database, we will investigate the effect of patient-physician gender
concordance on sex and gender disparities in AD/ADRD care and outcomes (e.g., anti-dementia medication
use, annual depression screening). In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of gender diversity in medical schools
and residency programs attended by the physician (the proportion of female students and faculty at the
medical school attended by the physician; the proportion of female residents and female patients with
AD/ADRD at residency program completed by the physician) on sex and gender disparities in AD/ADRD care
and outcomes. In Aim 3, we will investigate the effect of health system board diversity (the gender composition
of health system boards) on sex and gender disparities in AD/ADRD care and outcomes. This project will
provide a robust evidence base for policymakers to develop policy interventions (e.g., increasing female
representation in physician workforce, introducing sexual and gender sensitivity in medical education, and
promoting sex and gender diversity in health system boards) that could effectively mitigate sex and gender
disparities in AD/ADRD care. The research team consists of investigators with expertise in all relevant fields
(AD/ADRD care, geriatric care, women's health, and physician-level determinants of the quality of care) to
conduct this innovative research."
10917210,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Thyroid cancer is rapidly increasing in the U.S., with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) as the most common sub-
type. While most patients are cured of their thyroid cancer following initial treatment, a significant portion of
patients develop aggressive disease. Some PTCs even develop into anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), a
highly lethal and treatment-resistant disease with an abysmal 4-month survival. Cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) have been shown to play an important role in the aggressive behavior and progression of some cancers,
including pancreas and triple-negative breast cancer. Preliminary data from our group show that ATCs are
defined by a large population of tumor-promoting CAFs that express Fibroblast Activation Protein Alpha (FAP)
and Wnt-2 ligand. These CAFs sit along the tumor-stromal interface and likely support a de-differentiated and
stem-like phenotype in adjacent tumor cells, as defined by tenascin-C (TNC) expression. We find that small
numbers of these FAP+ CAFs are present in a subset of PTCs and serve as a robust biomarker of future disease
progression. Our preliminary studies provide compelling evidence that CAF subsets and CAF-derived Wnt
ligands drive tumor growth and progression, with elevated levels of Wnt signaling associated with poorly
differentiated and aggressive disease. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the role of CAFs in thyroid
malignancy and how their paracrine Wnt signaling supports aggressive tumor behavior.
To evaluate the role of CAFs in thyroid cancer, we have collected a cohort of ~300 patients with thyroid disease
from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Washington. We have also created the only
thyroid biobank with >50 primary-patient derived thyroid cancer organoids and corresponding CAF cultures. This
biobank allows our team to study the thyroid cancer microenvironment across a heterogeneous landscape of
morphologies and genetic alterations. Finally, we create a patient-derived xenograft mouse model for thyroid
cancer to study the in vivo biology of thyroid cancer and to test new therapeutics (including anti-Wnt drugs) for
thyroid cancers resistant to standard-of-care therapy. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
distinct CAF subsets (FAP+ Wnt-2+) are present in thyroid cancers and that their secretome drives Wnt-
mediated paracrine signaling for tumor progression. In Aim 1, we will define the role of Wnt signaling in
thyroid CAF heterogeneity in ATCs, PTCs, and composite tumors showing the transition between both
morphologies. In Aim 2, we will define the molecular interaction between Wnt-2 ligand and Tenascin-C (TNC) to
promote a stem-like phenotype in ATC. In Aim 3, we will investigate Wnt blockade for stromal reorganization and
treatment of ATC. An understanding of the role of CAFs and Wnt signaling will dramatically improve the detection
and treatment of the most aggressive forms of thyroid cancer. ATC has limited treatment options and a dismal
average survival of ~4 months. Successful completion of these goals will lead directly to clinical trials of novel
therapies for ATC that directly target the tumor-promoting stromal microenvironment."
10908311,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer tissues exhibit a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity, with cancerous tissues
comprising many different subpopulations of cells in various states. Quantifying this heterogeneity at the single-
cell level and with molecular depth across large numbers of cells provides information that cannot be obtained
from bulk studies and that will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and more effective treatments. While
single-cell sequencing approaches are having a significant impact on cancer research, proteins mediate the bulk
of cellular function and are the targets of most therapeutics. Given that a compelling body of literature has shown
that the correlation between RNA and protein abundance is at best poor to moderate, there is an urgent need to
develop new technologies for large-scale unbiased direct proteome profiling at the single-cell level. To fill this
gap, mass spectrometry (MS)-based profiling of protein expression in single cells has very recently become a
reality due to more efficient sample processing workflows, novel experimental designs and improved instrument
sensitivity. Label-free MS-based proteomics can currently quantify up to 1500 protein groups per cell across >4
orders of magnitude of dynamic range, but throughput has been limited to ~24 samples per day. This low
throughput is inadequate to perform the large-scale statistically powered studies required to characterize
heterogeneity in cancer cell populations. To increase measurement throughput, multiplexed workflows have
been developed based on isobaric tandem mass tags (TMTs) that enable >10 single cells to be measured in an
LC-MS analysis, but these suffer from a number of significant drawbacks including isotopic contamination,
degraded quantitative accuracy when employing a carrier channel, precursor coisolation with concomitant ratio
compression, chemical noise resulting from cross-reactivities of TMT reagents with contaminants, etc. The
overall objective is to develop a platform that exceeds the throughput of current TMT-based workflows while
preserving the depth of coverage and dynamic range of label-free workflows. We hypothesize that a robust
multicolumn ultra-high-performance nanoLC system with a 5-minute peptide elution window and a 100% duty
cycle, combined with novel MS1-level protein identification and quantification, will enable label-free profiling of
>2000 protein groups per cell at a throughput of up to 288 samples per day, thus providing a providing a capability
for direct, in-depth and large-scale protein quantification that is analogous to single-cell RNA-seq. Studies in Aim
1 will focus on developing high-peak-capacity fast nanoLC separations, as well as a novel sorbent-coated
sample-loop providing desalting and debris removal for robust long-term operation. In Aim 2 we will develop a
4-column LC platform based on these rapid separations and a primarily MS1-based acquisition workflow to
increate duty cycle to 100% and maximize coverage in these rapid analyses. We will apply this technology to
CD138+ single cells isolated from multiple myeloma patients to predict response to immunomodulatory imide
drugs (IMiDs). This project will establish an innovative measurement capability for individualizing cancer therapy."
10908312,"Scientific Abstract Malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) in children and adults are hypothesized to occur as a
result of events in utero. The high heritability of adult testicular GCT (TGCT) suggests a genetic etiology, and
recent genomewide association studies support this through the discovery of multiple susceptibility loci. We
recently confirmed a subset of these loci as susceptibility variants for pediatric GCT. While 5-year relative survival
rates are very high overall for GCTs, mainly due to the effectiveness of cisplatin chemotherapy, approximately
20% of patients will display resistance to chemotherapy or relapse following treatment. Clinical risk stratification
to identify patients with poor prognosis is still very crude and further molecular analysis, including analysis of
tumor epigenetics, may help to tailor treatment. Our recently completed Children’s Oncology Group (COG) case-
parent triad study of GCT was the first large study to collect germline DNA samples from pediatric and adolescent
GCT cases, tumor specimens and outcomes data. The research proposed in this application will allow us to
extend the scope of our ongoing study by evaluating tumor DNA methylation as a prognostic factor for GCT and
by expanding our analyses of germline genetic variation to include the sex chromosomes. Our overarching goal
for the proposed study is to evaluate the contribution of genetics and epigenetics in pediatric GCT risk and
outcomes. Our hypothesis is that DNA methylation patterns will predict GCT cases who are likely to have poor
outcomes. Further, we hypothesize that common and moderately rare variants on the sex chromosomes
increase risk for GCT. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will combine data from our ongoing COG case-parent
triad study of pediatric GCT (N=867 cases and 1,517 parent controls) with GCT cases and controls obtained
from the state biobank programs in California, Michigan and Washington (N=1,601 cases and 1,601 controls).
Our primary aims will be to: 1) Identify methylation patterns that predict poor outcomes, including disease relapse
and death, and 2) Discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) on the
sex chromosomes that contribute to GCT risk in children and adolescents. We will also evaluate the contribution
of rare genetic variants in GCT through the use of aggregate burden tests in an exploratory aim. Methylation will
be evaluated using the Illumina EPIC methylation array in 500 GCT tumor samples. Germline genetic analyses
will be conducted using existing GWAS data generated on the Illumina Human CoreExome array. The
contribution of rare variants will be assessed through analysis of whole exome sequencing data generated
through the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (N=250 trios) and Exome content available
for the entire dataset (N=2,468 cases). Little is known about the etiology of pediatric GCT; analysis of germline
genetic variation will shed light on disease biology. Identification of methylation patterns associated with poor
prognosis could improve the existing clinical risk stratification and suggest new avenues for treatment. Finally,
this will be the first study of GCT susceptibility in any age group to include individuals of non-European ancestry."
10908315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths
globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income
countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks),
neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key
determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are
acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there
are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are
contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities
where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road
traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road
traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big
Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help
overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built
environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield
of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific
objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and
traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My
career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and
the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied
to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE
features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features;
2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions
and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment
characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am
seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2)
creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian
spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4)
develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs."

10908277,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bleeding disorders in women remain under-recognized and under-treated. Although expert guidelines
recommend screening adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) for von Willebrand Disease (VWD),
our team has identified that under-screening remains widespread. Recent advances in VWD screening include
the validation of bleeding assessment tools (BATs), with the International Society of Thrombosis and
Haemostasis BAT (ISTH-BAT) serving as the current standard. However, the reference range of the ISTH-BAT
score for young women is unknown, and there is a lack of research examining the accuracy of BATs in primary
care settings. Our team has also shown that iron deficiency is common in young women with HMB, and while
point-of-care (POC) ferritin technology is newly available, its utility as a screening tool for VWD in women with
HMB has not been evaluated. The primary objective of this R01 application is to compare the validity of three
screening strategies to identify young women with HMB who have an underlying diagnosis of VWD: 1) BAT, 2)
POC ferritin, and 3) combined BAT + POC ferritin. Our rationale for this research is that early diagnosis of VWD
in women with HMB can alleviate morbidity and mortality by enabling health care providers to optimally manage
HMB and develop care plans for future surgical events and childbirth, thus decreasing the incidence and severity
of bleeding events. Building upon our expertise in BATs, VWD, and past success in the recruitment of young
women for HMB studies, we will achieve our objectives through the following specific aims: 1) establish the
reference range of the ISTH-BAT in a general population of post-menarchal females 10-20 years of age, 2)
compare the validity of the following screening tools (BAT, ferritin, BAT+ferritin) in identifying young women with
HMB and underlying VWD, and 3) assess the feasibility of a primary care VWD screening algorithm, as well as
patient, caregiver, and clinician experience. Our study population will include ~1,800 post-menarchal females
presenting for care at five primary care clinics. Participants will complete the BAT and POC ferritin during their
clinical visit. Those meeting the study definition of HMB will undergo laboratory testing for VWD. We will collect
feasibility measurements (i.e., participation rate, time to complete screening algorithm). We will perform semi-
structured interviews with a subset of participants, parents, and health care providers to explore domains such
as the acceptability, appropriateness, and impact of VWD screening on clinic workflows. Our central hypothesis
is that BAT + ferritin will have higher specificity for VWD than BAT or POC ferritin alone. Our project is innovative
because it shifts the study of young women with bleeding disorders from the status quo of specialized hematology
centers to the primary care settings in which young women with HMB initially present. The studies proposed
here will serve as a foundation for comparing a VWD primary care screening algorithm against standard of care
in a prospective clinical trial to measure its effect on health outcomes such as initiation of HMB and iron deficiency
treatment, specialty referral, laboratory screening for underlying bleeding disorders, and patient quality of life."

Biological science has rapidly evolved since the turn of the century; scientists are now able to
routinely generate and analyze data with super-resolutions and at genome-, transcriptome-,
proteome- and organism-wide scales. To rise to these challenges in the 21st century, the new
generation of scientists must then be trained to have a broad and interdisciplinary knowledge of
modern biology and experimental approaches in a highly collaborative environment. The training
program in Molecules, Cells, and Organisms (MCO) is designed to train the next- generation
biologists by allowing them access to faculty mentors representing all areas of modern biology—
from biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology to molecular, cell, neuro-, and
developmental biology to genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology to systems and
computational biology. The training program is located at the Cambridge campus of Harvard
University, and fifty-five faculty are drawn from five departments in the school of Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, including, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Chemistry and Chemical Biology,
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and Physics, and
faculty from the School of Engineering and Applied Science. Through its structure of core courses,
quantitative biology courses, journal club, nanocourses, hands-on model systems workshops, lab
rotations, seminars, scientific colloquia and retreats, the MCO program exposes its trainees from
the start to a rigorous and multidisciplinary training, and helps them to develop outstanding
reasoning, quantitative and creative skills required for modern biology, as well as oral and written

10908366,"Astrocytes are the major non-neuronal cell type in the cortex and are increasingly recognized as key contributors
to the development, plasticity and function of neuronal circuits. Yet, how they participate with neurons in learned
behavior and dynamically shape the underlying cortical circuits is poorly understood. The primary motor cortex
is required for learning and executing voluntary movements: the acquisition of a cued, stereotyped, movement
in mice is accompanied by synaptic remodeling of motor cortex neurons and the emergence of coordinated
movement-related ensemble neuronal activity. Here, we propose to examine functional astrocyte mechanisms
in motor cortex that mediate synaptic plasticity and neuronal dynamics during motor learning. Astrocytes have
highly ramified fine processes that contact nearly all synapses in the cortex, where they modulate synaptic
transmission and plasticity by mechanisms that include uptake of glutamate and GABA, primarily via the
transporters GLT1 and GAT3 respectively. Astrocytes also respond to, as well as modulate, synaptic activity with
spatiotemporally heterogeneous calcium transients in their processes, termed microdomains. We will examine
the role of astrocytes in shaping motor cortex circuits as mice learn a forelimb lever push movement, including
cued response onset and reliable movement trajectory, using a range of cutting-edge approaches: simultaneous
high-resolution imaging of astrocytes and neurons in vivo, computational encoding-decoding models of astrocyte
and neuronal activity, astrocyte-specific gene expression analyses, and novel astrocyte optogenetic and
CRISPR tools alongside established chemogenetic and viral knockdown methods. Building on our preliminary
data, which demonstrate parallel learning-related changes in astrocyte microdomain responses and neuronal
responses, along with gene expression changes in astrocyte GLT1 and GAT3, in Aim 1 we will determine
functional astrocyte calcium signatures in motor cortex during learning and their relationship to neuronal activity
and behavior. We hypothesize that astrocytes shape neuronal plasticity during task learning with corresponding
plasticity in their microdomain calcium responses, which we will specify computationally. In Aim 2, we will
determine the effect of astrocyte calcium signaling on motor learning and neuronal responses. We hypothesize
that disruption of calcium transients alters the emergence of neuronal ensembles and expert behavior, potentially
by altering astrocyte gene expression of transporter mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of
astrocyte neurotransmitter transporter function in motor cortex circuits and learning. We hypothesize that
disrupting astrocytic modulation of excitatory transmission via GLT1, and inhibitory neurotransmission via GAT3,
disrupts astrocytic calcium responses together with neuronal circuit plasticity and behavior. Together, these
studies will provide a mechanistic, computational view of astrocyte involvement in the function and plasticity of
cortical circuits, reveal their task-specific contributions to neuronal responses and learned behavior, and provide
the basis for understanding their role in a range of brain disorders and diseases."

Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the United States and its use is on the rise. Alcohol abuse can
result in alcoholic fatty liver disease, and even cirrhosis, as the majority of alcohol is metabolized by the liver
during first pass metabolism. Alcohol is primarily metabolized in the liver through two enzymatic reactions
(alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2) that each reduce an NAD+ to NADH, contributing to a
reduced redox state. Alcohol consumption reduces the redox state (greater NADH/ NAD+ ratio) which may
impair β-oxidation and the TCA cycle. These factors may result in a reduction in fatty acid oxidation and the
accumulation of lipids. Metabolic mechanisms in the liver may also use acetate as substrate to contribute to de
novo lipogenesis, further contributing to alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, as much as 80% of the acetate
produced during alcohol metabolism escapes the liver and can be used by peripheral tissues or organs such
as the heart. The heart is also severely affected by alcohol abuse, which can lead to cardiac dysfunction and
the development of various cardiovascular diseases, such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy. In the heart, acetate
interferes with fatty acid oxidation, which results in lower ATP concentrations, as well as the accumulation of
triglycerides. Acetate may impair the oxidation of free fatty acids (FFAs) as fuel, not through the inhibition of
CPT via malonyl-CoA production, but by metabolic mechanisms outcompeting CPT for free CoAs therefore
resulting in the limitation of FFAs entry into the mitochondria for oxidation. Administering acetate in in vitro
(heart perfusions) and in vivo infusion experiments results in an energy deficit through a mechanism that has
yet to be elucidated. It is possible that this energy deficit, and lipid accumulation, in the heart are contributing to
cardiac dysfunction. The aim of this proposal is to examine these particular metabolic mechanisms and
determine whether they are responsible for the alcohol induced energy deficit in the heart. This proposal will
also determine whether these mechanisms are responsible for mediating alcohol induced cardiac dysfunction.
A secondary aim is to determine, through the use of tracers, how chronic alcohol consumption changes
overtime and how the liver and heart metabolize and use alcohol metabolites."

Diabetes is a complex disease that results from the cumulative temporal effects of genetic and environmental factors. A hallmark of both common and rare forms of diabetes is genetic dysregulation of insulin-producing β cells which reside in islets of Langerhans and are scattered throughout the larger context of the entire pancreas. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) of type 2 diabetes (T2D), the most common form of diabetes, identified >600 statistically independent signals, they are difficult to translate into biological mechanisms because of their predominant noncoding location. Therefore, we propose to map the context specificity of T2D and related trait GWAS signals in pancreas across multiple dimensions: cell type, age, sex, developmental stage, and genetic background. Our proposal is based on our exciting single-cell multi-omic spatially-resolved pilot data and the well-supported idea that noncoding GWAS signals percolate upwards through complex and hierarchical molecular networks that influence cellular circuits. The initial layer in this hierarchy is chromatin organization, which propagates genetic predisposition onto subsequent molecular layers, likely starting with the transcriptome. Because islet physiology is influenced by the identity and spatial arrangement of surrounding cells within the pancreas, our multimodal molecular analyses will focus on four major pancreatic lineages; endocrine α and β cells, acinar, and ductal cells. In addition, we will incorporate the analysis of tissue resident macrophages because they play an important role in several processes including islet/pancreatic cell differentiation, growth, regeneration, and inflammation. The proposed studies will establish associations between regulatory elements, genes, cell types, tissue organization, and physiological function. Our multidisciplinary research team with complementary expertise in pancreas and islet biology, sequencing technologies, single cell genomics and epigenomics, image data analysis, and machine learning devised a suite of tools and analyses to discover cell state dynamic changes across diverse conditions, and how these changes influence downstream biology from transcriptional regulation, to cellular spatial organization within the pancreas, and finally to tissue-level physiology. This approach, if successful, will enable mechanistic insights across GWAS loci, which can inform new personalized therapeutic strategies."

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe thrombotic disorder initiated by ultralarge immune
complexes (ULICs) containing IgG antibody to a multivalent antigen composed of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and
heparin (H). Even today, patients with HIT remain at risk for death, amputation, recurrent thromboembolism and
bleeding while receiving maximally tolerated doses of anti-Xa or anti-thrombin agents. Thus, there is an unmet
need for a deeper insight into the pathobiology of thrombosis in HIT that will lead to targeted novel non-
anticoagulant interventions to supplement contemporary therapy. Our published and pilot data demonstrate that
activation of the complement pathway fulfills this gap. Specifically, we show that HIT ULICs: 1) interact with and
bind activated complement components 2) generate soluble complement components via the classical pathway,
3) deposit C3 on platelets, neutrophils, monocytes and endothelial cells (ECs), 4) initiate cellular activation
leading to neutrophil degranulation, monocyte tissue factor (TF) and procoagulant activity 5) activate
complement in the presence of direct thrombin inhibitors, 6) trigger complement-mediated cellular activation
upstream of C5 and 7) promote significant complement deposition in a murine thrombosis model. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that complement activation by HIT ULICs contributes to the prothrombotic state
in HIT through EC injury mediated by soluble and surface expressed complement receptors (CRs) and dual
amplification of FcγRs and CRs on cells expressing FcγRs. In the aims that follow, we will address the following
questions related to complement in HIT: 1) Does complement stabilize HIT ULICs, prevent disassembly and
amplify procoagulant responses by ECs that lack FcγRs? In this aim, we will test the hypothesis that complement
stabilizes ULIC assembly and promotes EC injury and impairs complement regulatory function, leading to release
of vWF multimers that amplify ULIC formation and complement activation. 2) Does complement amplify
procoagulant responses by FcγR expressing cells and serve as a biomarker of incipient disease? In this aim,
we will test the hypothesis that complement-coated ULICS amplify FcγRIIA signaling by promoting cooperativity
of complement and FcγR receptors. In this aim, we will examine effects of ULIC composition on cellular activation,
identify CRs involved in binding HIT ULICs, examine effects of HIT ULICs on soluble and cellular complement
regulatory mechanisms and characterize complement activation in patients with and without symptomatic anti-
PF4/heparin antibodies. 3) Can Complement inhibition serve as a therapeutic strategy for HIT? In this aim, we
will use microfluidic assays and murine thrombosis models to test the hypothesis that the net effects of
complement activation by HIT ULICs contributes to macrovascular thrombosis and its modulation can reduce
need for antithrombotic therapy in HIT. Together, these studies will provide new mechanistic insights into IC-
mediated thrombosis broadly and provide complement inhibition as a rationale for the treatment of HIT."

10917391,"PROJECT SUMMARY
SUMMARY: The broad goal of this project is to study the detailed molecular mechanisms by which histone
mutations associated with cancers perturb chromatin states, leading to disease. The next phase of this program
is driven by our recent work with the Allis lab revealing a vastly expanded landscape of putative oncohistone
mutations - over 4200 missense mutations in dozens of human cancers. Remarkably, the mutations occur in all
four of the core histones and in both the N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domains. The very large
number of newly identified oncohistones makes experimental characterization daunting. A key challenge is to
identify those mutations that act as potential cancer drivers from those that are merely a consequence of the
high mutation burden of a given tumor (i.e. passengers). We will work closely with other members of the P01
team to identify those mutations that most likely to fall into the former category and that, as such, merit in vivo
testing. Strategically, we will approach this problem using newly developed high-throughput biochemical and
yeast genetic screening tools (Aim 1) that are expected to identify mutations that alter chromatin stability and/or
that affect the activity of trans-acting factors that operate on the chromatin polymer. Validation of the ‘hits’ from
the screening studies will form the core of Aims 2 & 3 where we will combine the use of chemically-defined
chromatin templates with biochemical, proteomic and genomic approaches to develop a mechanistic
understanding of how select mutations impact chromatin state. In particular, we will study how breakdown in
nucleosome symmetry, as a result of sub-stoichiometric incorporation of mutant histones, affects key processes
such as chromatin remodeling and transcription. We imagine that many of the technologies developed in the
context of this work will have broad utility in the epigenetics field generally. Ultimately, the biochemical knowledge
base generated in the course of this program will motivate future therapeutic efforts for treating cancers
associated with oncohistone mutants."
10917392,"SUMMARY: The known histone H3K36-directed methyltransferases are essential for normal animal development and are frequently dysregulated in human cancers. We have found that high-frequency histone H3 mutations (oncohistones) exploit normal chromatin-based regulatory mechanisms, including H3K36 methylation, to drive tumorigenesis. Previously, we found that H3.3 G34 oncohistones selectively block SETD2-mediated H3K36 methylation and affect the activity of gene enhancers that results in aberrant cellular differentiation and proliferation. Moreover, we found that the H3 K36M oncohistone promotes genome-wide changes in histone and DNA methylation through competitive inhibition of NSD1/2 and SETD2 enzymes. We will leverage and extend our preliminary findings to define the mechanisms by H3.3 G34 and H3 K36M oncohistones achieve pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs through misregulation of H3K36 methylation. We will employ a multi-disciplinary approach that integrates biochemical, genomic, and molecular methods to enhance our understanding of K36M and G34 oncohistones and apply our understanding toward diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Specifically, we will: i) identify the changes in chromatin landscape by histone mutations using cell-based systems and patient tumor samples; and ii) characterize misregulated developmental programs that help establish tumorigenesis. These studies will provide guidance for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to ameliorate the pathogenic effects of NSD1/2 and histone H3 mutations in human cancers. We will also extend our findings to elucidate the mechanisms by which NSD1 and H3 K36M mutations alter the chromatin landscape in squamous cell carcinomas (Aim 1). We will define the mechanisms of by which G34 mutations alter chromatin modifications and gene expression, and we will define the role of H3.3 chaperone pathways in mediating G34 phenotypes (Aim 2). Additionally, we have found that H3K36 methylation opposes PRC2 activity, thus preventing Polycomb-mediated gene repression. We will now leverage these biochemical findings to determine the function of the EZH2 H3K36-binding pocket in different tumorigenesis models (Aim 3). Expected results from our study will lead us formulate novel theories and provide crucial mechanistic insights of these oncohistones which can be readily tested in in vivo cancer models (Project 1,2) and in vitro chemistry platforms (Project 3). To accomplish these aims, Project 4 also requires close interactions with both Cores."

The use of gene therapy for chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, has increased dramatically since the
early 2000s, but a safe, long-term delivery method remains missing. Despite a highly safe profile with partial
therapeutic effects after successful delivery in CF patients, the gene transfer efficiency, in terms of transfection
per particle, remains limited when using viral-based delivery systems. Genexys has developed a modular non-
viral gene transfer platform that directly addresses the limitations of current CF gene therapeutic strategies. The
technology is a DNA and RNA nanoparticle platform capable of holding large genes combined with uptake
enhancers that inhibit proteins that limit gene transfer to targeted cells. Our foundational work has demonstrated
our DNA nanoparticle technology successfully delivers therapeutic loads of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) in cell culture, animal models, and human subjects. Our unique proprietary
enhancer library allows our non-viral system to overcome the gene transfer limitations of our competitors. This
library of enhancer molecules is hypothesize to work through Nucleolin (NCL), an essential protein for DNP-
based cell surface receptor that facilitates gene membrane transfer and nuclear trafficking. This project further
develops our non-viral nanoparticle gene therapy system in an in vitro and in vivo context. We aim to demonstrate
transgene delivery with enhancers restores primary function in human bronchial epithelia cells and can overcome
muscus inhibition in mouse FDA IND-enabling studies. We will also explore different delivery formulations. The
deliverables will include an established efficacy of this product in a commercially available gene therapeutic, and
that this revolutionary technology can be available to all CF patients needing advance treatment options."

pre-clinical atlas pilot. Also, together they have worked extensively on the molecular and cellular biology of prostate
precursor lesions , together finding partial DNA methylation of GSTP1 in high grade PIN lesions and PIA; a finding
directly relevant to the current proposal. Finally, they have worked together extensively, with Dr. Bieberich, on the

10918239,"Project Summary/Abstract:
We have proposed that inflammatory infiltrates in human PIA reflect an anti-prostatic pro-inflammatory immune
response that serves as a hotbed for cancer initiation. Interestingly, the acute and chronic inflammatory cell
infiltrates common in PIA are generally not seen in most prostate cancers. These observations have prompted
our proving ground hypothesis which suggests that in order for prostate cancer to develop past these
initiated steps in PIA to bona fide pre-neoplastic precursor (PIN) and to invasive carcinoma, this immune
response must be abrogated. We observed upregulation of stress-response and inflammatory genes in human
PIA luminal epithelial cells. These same genes (examples: GSTP1, PTGS2, and LTF ) are epigenetically silenced
in PIN and early and metastatic invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate. This led to a potential molecular
mechanism in which a set of genes whose expression is highly induced in PIA undergo silencing to allow cells to
emerge as PIN and invasive carcinoma. We show here that the major inflammatory mediator Stimulator of
Interferon Genes (STING) is absent in normal prostate luminal cells, is highly induced in intermediate luminal
cells in PIA, and is not expressed in the vast majority of human PIN and adenocarcinomas. We hypothesize
STING expression in PIA luminal cells is required for inflammation, cell injury, and the prostate cancer initiation.
Second, we hypothesize that in a subset of PIA cells, epigenetic silencing of STING (or of its downstream
signaling activity) results in dampening of the immune response, imparting a growth advantage by allowing them
to emerge as neoplastic cells. We will test these hypotheses in as follows. In Specific Aim 1 we will genetically
and pharmacologically test the STING activation hypothesis for developing acute and chronic inflammation, PIA
and PIN in the mouse prostate using our unique mouse model of IL1-beta induced prostatic inflammation and
PIA progressing to PIN (IMPI mice). In Specific Aim 2 we will test the “epigenetic silencing of induced genes”
hypothesis in human samples by performing a comprehensive characterization of DNA-methylation based
epigenomic changes in mouse and human epithelial cells in the transitions from prostatic inflammatory lesions to
neoplasia. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that STING (along with many other stress and inflammation induced
genes) is epigenetically silenced at the transition stage of PIA to high grade PIN. In Specific Aim 3, we
hypothesize that in ""graduating"" from the proving ground, neoplastic cells leave behind the pro-inflammatory
microenvironment in PIA, and sculpt a microenvironment with reduced adaptive immune cells through
recruitment of immune suppressive myeloid and lymphoid cells (e.g. MDSCs, M2 macrophages and Tregs) that
help quell the cancer immune response. We will define the cellular composition and spatial architecture of
microenvironment in mouse and human early precursor prostatic inflammatory lesions."
10918241,"Project Summary
The goal of this translational project is to link the genetic and cellular features of the overarching, proving ground
[cancer-permissive tumor microenvironment (TME)] hypothesis of this U54 application to imaging biomarkers
that can be used clinically to detect and ultimately intercept prostate cancer. Little is known about the cellular
subtypes that participate in the epithelial-stromal interactions in prostate cancer, or about the timing of their
appearance during progression. We have developed a series of translational imaging agents designed to
measure cancer epithelium and specific cells within the TME. We will leverage a subset of those agents to
understand quantitatively the TME in prostate cancer so that it can be detected and reprogrammed early during
malignant transformation. In Aim 1 we will image patients with primary prostate cancer prospectively with multi-
parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and 18F-DCFPyL (PyL) positron emission
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), which targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).
We will perform standard-of-care PyL PET/CT imaging on patients with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer
prior to prostatectomy. We will quantify and correlate between imaging and pathology with the hypothesis that
PSMA-low regions in otherwise high-grade tumors correlate with adverse pathology at prostatectomy in an effort
to understand better the heterogeneity of primary disease. We will also compare PyL PET/CT with the cellular
composition and spatial architecture of immune and stromal compartments of the prostate cancer TME. We will
also retrospectively use prostatectomies from the same patients that were consented for genomic studies in
Project 2. We will test the hypothesis that PyL PET/CT measured PSMA levels will directly correlate with MYC
expression, MYC copy number gain, PTEN loss, and TP53 mutation. We will also determine in an unbiased
manner which gene expression, genomic and epigenomic alterations best correlate with PSMA PET imaging
features. We will also employ radiomic and machine-learning approaches not only to subtype patients with
prostate cancer into prognostic groups, as we have done before, but also to predict who may have aggressive
disease on initial PyL PET/CT staging. For this we will require merging not only the mpMRI and PyL PET/CT
data, but also the histopathology, relevant genomics, and available protected historical information. Aims 2 and
3 involve longitudinal studies in the BMPC murine model, which we have developed and recapitulates human
prostate cancer according to a specific timetable. We will determine the extent of macrophages and cancer-
associated fibroblasts in and around the BMPC tumors as they develop over time and correlate their presence
with imaging by small animal PET/MR. We will use novel imaging agents that we have developed, which target
CSF1R (macrophages) and FAP (CAFs), and correlate the results with immunohistochemistry and genomics.
Through careful radiologic-pathologic correlation, this project will provide rationale for future clinical studies to
understand better the TME in prostate cancer, and how it can be reprogrammed to combat this disease."
10918243,"Project Summary/Abstract:
There is a critical need to understand the pathogenesis of aggressive vs indolent prostate cancer. The
combination of PTEN loss and MYC copy number gain predicts poor outcome in prostate cancer. Moreover,
PTEN loss, even in low grade lesions, can indicate the presence of high grade aggressive prostate cancer. We
found a synergistic interaction in driving aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma by combining Pten loss with MYC
overexpression in a mouse model (BMPC mice). However, the molecular mechanisms by which MYC and PTEN
cooperate in driving aggressive disease are not known. We hypothesize that the combination stimulates a cell
non-autonomous immune evasion mechanism through recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and
cancer associated fibroblasts. We additionally hypothesize that these microenvironmental alterations
accompanying progression to aggressive cancer with PTEN loss may have already been conditioned in PIA
lesions within the proving ground from which these neoplastic cells initially emerged. These hypotheses are
based on strong preliminary data and prior reports indicating that: i) the chemokine Cxcl5 is upregulated upon
Pten deletion in prostate cancer precursors with high aggressive potential (BMPC PIN), and are associated with
recruitment of polymorphonuclear myeloid derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) and with increased M2
macrophages in BMPC invasive cancers; ii) these increases in myeloid cells in BMPC cancers parallel
observations of increased M2 macrophages in high grade human prostate cancer and in association with PTEN
loss; iii) aggressive human prostate cancer lesions with PTEN loss and in BMPC animals often harbor a reactive
stroma, which is correlated with FAP expression, and which has been implicated as a driver of
immunosuppression and cancer cell invasion; and iv) expression of CXCL5, and of FAP in the stroma, is
associated with a subset of PIA lesions, suggesting that these features may already be conditioned in the PIA
proving ground and reawakened during progression to aggressive disease with PTEN loss. In Aim 1, we
hypothesize that Pten loss in BMPC PIN precursors leads to induction of the chemokine Cxcl5, which recruit
PMN-MDSC and M2 macrophages to engender an immunosuppressive phenotype. In our preliminary data, we
observed an association with FAP-positive reactive stroma in the vicinity of PTEN-lost human prostate cancer.
Furthermore, FAP was upregulated in aggressive cancers from BMPC mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the role
of reactive stroma and FAP in mediating immune evasion and aggressive prostate cancer in BMPC mice. In
Aim 3, we hypothesize that the types of changes seen with PTEN loss, including FAP activation and CXCL5
upregulation, and myeloid cell infiltration, were already conditioned to occur during “graduation” of the neoplastic
cells from the PIA proving ground. Thus, we will define the epithelial and microenvironmental alterations
associated with PTEN loss in human prostate cancer, and nearby PIA and PIN lesions."

epithelial and stromal compartments of PIA, PIN, and cancer lesions. Specific technologies include, genome
wide and ultra-deep targeted DNA methylation analysis, multi-modal single nucleus ATAC- and coupled RNA-
seq (snATAC-/snRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics. Integration across the multi-modal data streams will
be possible through implementation of the innovative Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization and transfer

10922686,"Summary. High resolution imaging in deep tissue (> 1 cm) environments can address a swathe of funda-
mental and applied problems in the elucidation of mechanisms of disease origin and progression. While fluores-
cence imaging is a workhorse technique for the cellular imaging of biological molecular markers, it suffers from
light scattering, and aberration distortions at tissue depths >1 mm. On the opposite end of the spectrum, mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established and broadly employed pre-clinical and clinical imaging
method that has no practical limitations with respect to tissue depth, but it suffers from low resolution. In this
project we will innovate a new class of hyperpolarized 13C nanoparticle probes that can serve as efficient deep
tissue markers in MRI. Our central idea is to dramatically boost 13C NMR signal by means of (i) optical hyperpo-
larization that can be carried out at low magnetic fields and (ii) significant extension of 13C coherence times.
Specifically, we propose to develop MRI probes based on fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) endowed with
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. The electronic spins associated with NVs can be optically “hyperpolarized” and
that polarization to be effectively transferred to the diamond 13C nuclear spins, resulting in NMR signal enhance-
ment over three orders of magnitude vs. 13C thermal polarization at the fields of clinical MRI. In conjunction, by
implementing effective decoupling schemes we propose significantly extend the 13C spin coherences to be able
to interrogate them for second-long periods. The latter yields enormous signal gains, a multiplicative factor of
another 103- fold. Combining the gains due to hyperpolarization and spin coherence extensions permits a total
signal gain of ca. 106 for MRI, and will enable a significant improvement in spatial resolution. Moreover, since
the polarization is optically generated, this 13C photo-MRI (PMRI), can be carried out at low-field at a much lower
cost vs. conventional MRI infrastructure. In our method the spin polarization is regenerated optically, allowing for
acquiring MRI data repeatedly and enabling longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the FND particles are inherently
biocompatible, and their surfaces are amenable to a versatile set of targeting ligands. With this basis, we propose
to develop targetable fluorescent nanoparticle MRI probes that can be imaged with high fidelity with resolution
better than 20 um in deep tissue (>1 cm) settings. In addition to being bright MRI agents, the particles are also
bright fluorescent providing an option for a cross-examination of the agent biodistribution in histopathological
analysis. In order to realize the prospects of this novel technology, we propose to further develop the hyperpo-
larization and MR imaging methodologies, as well as boost hyperpolarizability of nanosized particles by optimiz-
ing their structure through synthesis and processing developments. We aim at transferring the PMRI technology
we demonstrated for micron-sized particles to the nanosized FND suitable for in vivo MRI. As a part of the
technology demonstration, we will construct a simple prototype PMRI imaging set-up on the benchtop (low-field)
and image FNDs in tissue phantoms, characterizing achievable metrics of resolution and imaging depth."
10917524,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Comorbid metabolic conditions of stroke, including obesity and diabetes, worsen stroke injury and reduce the
capacity for stroke recovery. Given that stroke and these comorbid metabolic conditions are highly prevalent,
the goal of this project is to understand how their interactions mechanistically affect the corticospinal motor
system using high fat diet (HFD) as a model of metabolic disruption. In preliminary testing, HFD profoundly
worsens behavioral motor recovery after experimental stroke. HFD and experimental stroke also cause an
abnormal and profound emergence of lower extremity motor commands in areas of motor cortex that show little
of these commands in otherwise healthy conditions or with experimental stroke injury and control diet. These
abnormal lower extremity motor commands appear to be mechanistically due to increased synaptic signaling
within the corticospinal system at connections that have not been well identified in this pathway. Volitional skilled
motor control of the extremities is primarily achieved by the corticospinal tract and this pathway is often damaged
by stroke resulting in severe disability. The canonical view of the corticospinal tract is that it is a synaptic circuit,
from layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) in motor cortex, to spinal motor neurons that themselves signal skeletal
muscle (CST= L5PCs→ spinal motor neurons→ skeletal muscle). L5PCs that project to cervical spinal cord
(cervical-projecting) are thought to control upper extremity function whereas L5PCs that project to lumbar spinal
cord (lumbar-projecting) are thought to control lower extremity function. What is less known is whether single
L5PCs can innervate cervical and lumbar levels of spinal cord and thus contribute motor control to upper and
lower extremities. Similarly, it is recognized that L5PCs synapse on one-another (L5PCs→L5PCs) however it is
not known whether this is true between cervical-projecting L5PCs and lumbar-projecting L5PCs during stroke
recovery. Experiments here will test these seldom studied connections of the corticospinal system because they
may underpin the abnormal emergence of lower extremity motor commands that arise when HFD is combined
with experimental stroke. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose 3 aims: Aim 1. Determine whether
distribution and in vivo signaling of cervical- and lumbar-projecting L5PCs can support abnormal emergence of
hindlimb motor commands in anterior motor cortex when HFD is combined with experimental stroke. Aim 2. Test
whether physiology of cervical- and lumbar-projecting L5PCs can support abnormal emergence of hindlimb
motor commands in anterior motor cortex when HFD is combined with experimental stroke. Aim 3. Test timing,
duration and persistence of HFD to exacerbate upper and lower extremity deficits after experimental stroke
injury. This proposal aims to determine the corticospinal circuits responsible for this abnormal plasticity of lower
extremity motor control in order to guide its future targeted treatment as a novel therapy for stroke recovery in
the context of clinically-relevant comorbid metabolic conditions."
10922732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy is a known risk factor for high birthweight, excessive newborn
adiposity, and related pregnancy complications including cesarean delivery, shoulder dystocia and birth injury.
Sequelae of elevated pregnancy glucose are not limited to the perinatal period. Mothers meeting criteria for
gestational diabetes are more likely to develop long-term metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes.
Maternal glucose also has an apparent sustained influence on fetal programming, with offspring of
hyperglycemic mothers at higher risk of both excess adiposity and disordered glucose metabolism throughout
childhood and into adolescence. While debate exists as to specific criteria that should be used for diagnosing
gestational diabetes, it is the case that adverse maternal and offspring outcomes related to both
anthropometrics and glucose metabolism, both at delivery and over a decade later, are associated with
maternal glucose values across the continuum. Existing diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes are based
on measures of maternal glucose, typically at ~28 weeks' gestation. To more fully elucidate maternal glycemia
and identify potential early indicators of gestational diabetes, Clinical Centers comprising the National Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium will be charged
with designing a multicenter observational study of pregnant mothers without pre-existing diabetes to richly
characterize maternal glycemic profiles using sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring technology. The
Northwestern University Biostatistics Research Center proposes to serve as a central leadership hub for the
Glycemic Profile of Pregnancy Consortium, coordinating all data-related and operational activities using
cutting-edge resources for study design, planning and conduct, ongoing data monitoring and statistical
analysis."

The work to be pursued in this application will continue and expand the program pioneered by Dr. Iavarone to
combine innovative computational tools and state-of-the-art experimental cancer models in vitro and in vivo to
identify homogeneous subgroups of cancer patients in order to dissect the pathogenesis of cancer and design
tailored and fully validated personalized therapeutic approaches. The application is focused on glioblastoma
multiforme, one of the most lethal forms of human cancer. The investigation of glioblastoma has represented a
long-standing effort of Dr. Iavarone’s laboratory, which in recent work has produced novel targeted therapeutic
opportunities currently being tested in clinical studies. The proposal will also benefit from the organizational
contexts recently set in motion by the large network operations coordinated by the PI. The research plan is
articulated around the development of a novel and integrated computational-experimental framework for: i) the
identification of homogeneous groups of tumors sharing activation of the same biological pathways; ii) the study
of cancer heterogeneity at the single cell level to accurately inform tumor classifications; iii) the therapeutic
prediction emerging from the identification of driver modules and synthetic lethal relationships of malignant
glioma. We will develop and apply novel technologies for high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic analysis
of individual cells within malignant glioma tissues. These approaches, which we have pioneered in our laboratory
at Columbia University during the last few years, will serve as the basis for the multifaceted computational
analysis that will extract genes and proteins responsible for the phenotypic state of individual cells. Experimental
validations will be selectively applied to the novel and most exciting molecular pathways and will be performed
by our laboratory that has an array of experimental tools and sequence-annotated patient-derived models to
pursue each individual question. As for the selection of oncogene-dependent and independent vulnerabilities
identified by our previous work, the ability of our studies to identify novel driver phenotypes and master regulators
of individual tumor cells will be geared towards routing the new mechanisms into pathway-based synthetic
lethality that will inform specific drug sensitivities. The successful outcome of this proposal is an integrated
computational-experimental pipeline that will be able to mechanistically identify the determinants of tumor
genomes and phenotypes of solid tumors. This information will be of invaluable significance to decipher evolving
tumor dependencies and provide the most accurate therapeutic predictions."

As a recognized leader in cancer research,1 MD Anderson Cancer Center is well poised to address a
significant lack of diversity in the cancer research workforce that contributes to considerable disparities.2-6 We
will do so via early intervention programs that foster sustained interest in cancer research in students
underrepresented and minority in Science (URMS). Since 2011, we have directed a summer undergraduate
training program encompassing 345 trainees (from 2011-2018), including 120 URMS. Significantly, outcomes
for URMS and non-minority trainees in our program are indistinguishable; URMS and non-minority alumni are
enrolled in or have completed STEM bachelor’s (98.8% vs 98.1%) and doctoral (both 67.1%) degrees and are
retained in STEM education or workforce (98.3% vs 98.6%, respectively). Built upon these successes, we have
designed a comprehensive cancer research training program for high school and undergraduate URMS via the
R25 YES initiative. In our URMS-focused program, we address major barriers in URMS pursuit and success in
STEM, including: limited 1) research experience, 2) career path knowledge, and 3) scientific identity formation
and exposure to science; 4) underdeveloped professionalism and communication skills; 5) inadequate
research, educational, and career mentoring; and 6) barriers in the graduate application process. Our
proposed UPWARDS Training Program (Underrepresented Minorities Working Towards Research Diversity in
Science) has 3 tracks: full-time, 12-week summer research for 1) high-schoolers and 2) undergraduates and 3)
part-time, 40-week research for undergraduates. Within each track, we propose the following aims to address
the aforementioned barriers: Aim 1) Employ focused URMS recruitment and holistic strategies for program
inclusion, and deliver didactic learning and hands-on cancer research experiences through a cadre of
outstanding mentoring faculty. Aim 2) Develop and deliver individualized mentoring, career exploration,
and professional development that stimulates graduate education and cancer research career pursuit.
Aim 3) Educate and inspire URMS communities, young generations in the STEM pipeline, and the
families and support systems of our students through training, STEM outreach, and hands-on
engagement. We will encourage our trainees to lead and encourage their communities and younger
generations through hands-on STEM outreach activities and design and delivery of community education.
Aim 4) Implement and maintain a rigorous assessment program with continual appraisal and enactment of
novel, evidence-driven best practices derived from these efforts. Lastly, we commit to disseminating our
findings and best practices via peer-reviewed publications. Through the UPWARDS Program, we will build
upon our prior experiences and best practices to launch a cancer research training program specifically
designed to fit the needs of URMS trainees in our local community and nationally. We anticipate our efforts will
effectively increase diversity in the STEM educational pipeline and cancer research workforce."
10915685,"Project Summary
 The proposed project has two aims: 1) to assess the short and long-term impact of school closures
mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic on students’ weight status, and 2) to examine the mitigating potential of
child-targeted food assistance programs implemented during the closures. While there is some evidence that
interruptions in school during summer recess result in weight gain among children in elementary grades, we
have little basis for predicting the effects of a hiatus of unprecedented length, 6 months or more posed by the
coronavirus. Pursuant to the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the USDA extended the summer
feeding program to deliver meals to children during the pandemic-related school closures; the USDA also
authorized emergency food assistance through Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer cards for out-of-school
children who qualify for school meals programs. While summer meals have been provided in the past to some
students through summer meals programs, research establishing the adequacy of these programs in
addressing weight status is lacking. To address the study aims, we will collect and analyze nurse-measured
heights and weights data on children attending 120 public schools serving low-income children in New Jersey.
Interrupted times series analyses will be applied to data collected prior to school closures, during four school
years (SY) between 2013-14 and 2019-20 (approximately 30,000 students per year); and an additional two
school years post-closure, one coinciding with the re-opening of schools (SY2020-21) and the other two years
later (SY2022-23). For the same school years, we will incorporate, as covariates, annual data on school food
and physical activity (PA) environments that have been found to be associated with weight status, as well as
measures of the surrounding food and PA environment known to affect obesity rates. New data on operation
and reach of the two federal, child-targeted food assistance programs in school catchment areas over the
course of school closures will be collected to establish the mitigating potential of these programs. The
proposed study will make a unique contribution to our understanding of the long-term effects of a key
dimension of federal obesity policy affecting some thirty million predominantly low-income children – provision
of free and reduced priced school meals. As such, the findings will be critical to our readiness to respond to
future disasters and to our efforts to assure the adequacy of the food safety net."

 3 The purpose of this K01 Award is to provide the candidate with the training and expertise needed to transition to
 4 research independence in prevention of child maltreatment (CM). The centerpiece of the project is a proposed
 5 study which will use a community-engaged approach to integrate and test three evidence-based programs
 6 (EBPs) to prevent CM, domestic violence (DV), and other ACEs in Kyrgyzstan. The project will feature innovative
 7 training for the PI in integration and adaptation of EBPs to child/family outcomes, longitudinal intervention
 8 research, and quantitative measurement/analysis. It will also feature strong mentoring from group of senior
 9 mentors with an outstanding track record of NIH-supported research and an extensive history of mentoring junior
10 faculty, as well as NGOs, all with extensive experience/commitment to preventing CM. Prevention of CM is of
11 paramount importance to individual, family and community wellbeing, particularly among those
12 disproportionately affected, such as families in LMICs, and is relevant for immigrant and refugee populations in
13 the U.S. Although promising approaches exist, they have not been adapted and rigorously evaluated among
14 Central Asian (CA) populations. Although there is strong evidence about the efficacy of these approaches in the
15 general population in the U.S. and other global contexts, these complementary and synergistic approaches have
16 never been deployed jointly in research. To address the needs of the at-risk for ACEs families, the proposed
17 program will adapt and pilot a family-focused (Multiple Family Groups) school-based (School Children and Their
18 Families) economic empowerment (FEE) program to promote positive health and socioeconomic outcomes for
19 children: 1) MFG is a family-centered, group delivered EBP designed for children/adolescents whose families
20 struggle with poverty and associated stressors; 2) SAF has shown to have significant improvements in (co)-
21 parenting and child behavioral outcomes; 3) FEE builds protective factors for individual/family wellbeing by
22 addressing economic stressors and strengthening financial capability. Combining MFG+SAF+FEE is
23 hypothesized to improve child and family wellbeing more than any of the individual interventions’ effects, with
24 each intervention achieving its own specific effects and contributing to the efficacy of the others. These EBPs
25 must be carefully adapted to the culture and distinct needs of the target groups. The proposed study will build
26 on this prior research by implementing these approaches jointly as a package. Carrying out this innovative study
27 in a context of specialized training and mentoring will provide the PI with the skills and experience to leverage
28 community-engaged implementation science for wider application in global contexts. The award will equip the
29 PI to take on a leadership role in the prevention of CM through the use of innovative mixed-method measures in
30 the process of adapting and assessing the most promising approaches to prevent CM in global health contexts."
10915392,"7. Project Summary/Abstract .
Cardiac arrest is a common and devastating emergency of the heart and the brain. More than 380,000
patients suffer out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year in the US. Improvements in cardiac
resuscitation (the early links in the “chain of survival” for patients with OHCA) are tempered by our limited
ability to resuscitate and protect the brain from global cerebral ischemia. Neurological death and disability are
common outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. Therapeutic cooling of comatose patients resuscitated from
shockable rhythms may markedly increase the rate of good neurological outcome, but poor outcomes still
occur in as many as 50%, and the benefit of cooling in those resuscitated from asystole and pulseless
electrical activity has not been evaluated in a randomized study. Even in patients with shockable rhythms, prior
trials showing efficacy have been questioned. Therapeutic cooling is already a guideline-recommended and
commonly used treatment in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, but because of limited data, the optimal
duration and patient selection criteria remain unknown and cooling devices are not FDA approved for this
indication. Preclinical data and mechanistic studies strongly suggest that durations of hypothermia longer than
those typically used may minimize brain injury. This study will determine if identifying an optimal duration of
therapeutic hypothermia can improve outcomes, and if development of a duration response curve can
substantiate efficacy in a wider patient population of cardiac arrest survivors. We hypothesize that longer
durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or
may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having good outcome. The
overarching goal of this project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with
good neurological recovery from cardiac arrest. The results of this trial will be immediately significant,
impacting both clinical practice and regulatory evaluation. The trial uses innovative adaptive dose finding
methods that allow exploration of a wide range of potential durations and efficiently allocate subjects where
they will be most informative. The study methods also include innovative approaches to traditional outcome
assessment and innovative outcome assessment tools, including the NIH Toolbox. The study will be
conducted in the NIH SIREN Emergency Clinical Trials infrastructure. SIREN leverages existing resources to
achieve economies of scale, maintain talented rapidly responding teams to screen and enroll subjects in the
emergency department setting, and to continue clinical investigations through the ICU stay and beyond with
proven performance."
10915502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost all maternal and perinatal deaths worldwide are in low-income countries (LICs). Delays in accessing
and receiving appropriate quality pregnancy care, particularly during labor and delivery, is a major reason for
these outcomes. Reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes is a current and high global priority. The University of
Alabama at Birmingham's (UAB) maternal and fetal medicine and neonatology groups are the primary referral
services for high-risk pregnancies and newborns statewide in underserved Alabama. Through UAB's highly
valued, busy and pioneering toll-free 24/7 Medical Information Service via Telephone (MISTTM), timely, and
often life-saving point-of-care consultation and guidance is available to rural providers caring for pregnant
women and newborns. Although such provider support services are now part of standard-of-care in the
United States, their implementation and assessment of that implementation are often unavailable in
LICs with the worst maternal and perinatal outcomes. The rapid rise in mobile phone ownership in LICs
provides a tremendous opportunity to adapt, implement, and evaluate innovative, potentially life-saving
interventions such as MISTTM. The mobile platform can help mitigate structural barriers and enhance
healthcare access needs of the patient by providing clinical support for remotely-located providers facing
medical emergencies -- while also enhancing local care systems in resource-constrained settings. Thus, the
purpose of this study is to adapt and evaluate the implementation of mobile-phone based MIST (mMIST) to
improve maternal and newborn outcomes in a LIC. The proposed mMIST intervention will be adapted from our
ongoing experience at UAB and implemented in Cameroon, which has the 9th highest maternal mortality ratio
and one of the highest rates of perinatal mortality in the world. We propose three Specific Aims: 1) Adapt and
develop a 24/7 mHealth support system for peripheral providers who provide healthcare to pregnant women
and newborns; 2) Test mMIST's feasibility and acceptability in one health district in northwest Cameroon, and
3) Evaluate the effectiveness - using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design - of full-scale
implementation of mMIST in reducing maternal and perinatal deaths, and serious maternal and newborn
morbidities in 19 districts (clusters) of northwest Cameroon with 65,000 deliveries per year. A participatory
approach involving stakeholders and a representative task force will inform the development and delivery of
the intervention. Three frameworks will inform this study, WHO Model for Quality of Care, ADAPT-ITT for
intervention adaptation, and the implementation science Exploration, Preparation, Implementation,
Sustainment (EPIS) model. Additional features include plans to ensure sustainability by engaging the
government and mobile service providers, and attention to m-health capacity building within this rigorous
research study. If demonstrated effective, scaling-up the mMIST intervention will improve maternal and
newborn outcomes across similar LIC settings."
10915687,"In 2019 many bioscience and health related jobs are going unfilled, not only because too few STEM degrees
are being granted (not all of these jobs require degrees) but also because adults either lack key competencies
in thinking analytically and solving STEM-related problems or cannot apply them to STEM fields. Moreover,
minority and under-resourced communities are disproportionately under-represented, in large part because
they lack access to role models and information about what the careers entail. High school, where entire
cohorts of the US population gather to learn together for the last time, is an obvious venue in which to develop
these capacities and increase participation from all communities. Our long-standing partnership with teachers
in the majority/minority Boston Public Schools has developed a curriculum for 10th-12th graders that targets
these competencies. Teachers who have been supported in learning to teach these novel concepts are able to
significantly increase student engagement and analytical and problem-solving abilities from a large number of
diverse schools and independent of the gender and ethnicity of the students, fostering their confidence in
learning about health topics. However, this curriculum is not designed to integrate career awareness into
competency building. In this project we aim to capitalize on the partnerships, infrastructure and evaluation
tools we have already deployed successfully to create a new curriculum and professional development model:
It has three phases: (1) We will create and implement new curricula that tightly integrate career awareness
with competency building to improve student self-efficacy and outcomes expectations, critical first steps toward
selecting a bioscience career. The curriculum will also provide extensive teacher professional development
support. (2) We will develop new online dual-enrollment courses in which students can gain college credits
while still in high school. The courses will incorporate with skills and strategies needed for a successful
transition to independent learning environments into cutting-edge biomedical science topics. (3) We will
provide students with financial support so they can participate in our intensive residential college awareness
and readiness program and will optimize their success with near-peer mentor support before, during and after
participation. Once the program has been created and evaluated, we will go on to disseminate the curricula
and teacher support though our existing online infrastructure to reach maximal audiences. The new project is
significant because it integrates teaching high school students critical high-level STEM competencies with
extensive career awareness thereby fostering workforce preparation. It is innovative because it provides a
model for how medical school scientists can interact with teachers to influence curricula, teacher development
and STEM/bioscience workforce participation and because the web-based resource facilitates nationwide
dissemination."

This application requests funding to support the travel expenses of early career researchers focusing
on renal and urothelial physiology, and presenting their research at the Epithelial Transport Group
(ETG) scientific sessions at the American Physiological Society (APS) Summit Meeting 2024. This
meeting was newly formed in 2023 and replaced the previous Experimental Biology meeting where
APS was one of the core societies. The new APS Summit meeting will be the stand alone, annual
meeting of the APS. All ETG sessions will occur in this annual meeting. APS Summit will take place
April 4-7th, 2024 in Long Beach, CA. The meeting will be held at the Long Beach Convention
Center, which offers an ADA-compliant infrastructure for individuals with disabilities and special
needs. ETG has a longstanding history of promoting interactions among physiologists from diverse
backgrounds who study biological processes in epithelia and encourages students, postdoctoral
fellows, and instructors to develop research careers in epithelial biology. Based on prior experience
and survey data, trainees consistently view the annual ETG sessions as a valuable training
experience that reinforces their interest in the field and promotes retention in epithelial-centric
biomedical research. Thus, we strive to optimize trainee exposure to ETG-related events by providing
travel award support for promising early career investigators with limited travel resources. This
application will solely focus on supporting early career researchers focused on KUH-centric
related research areas.
This year, ETG will continue to work in collaboration with the Renal Section in development of renal and
urothelial-focused topics and sessions. All trainees who submit ETG-based abstracts to the Renal
Section will be eligible for travel awards. The abstracts will be reviewed and scored jointly by
members of both the Renal Section and ETG Steering Committees. The travel awards will be
allocated based on merit. Award amounts will be contingent on the funds that are available.
Regardless of the amount; however, the budget incorporates an additional supplement to awardees
with child/family care needs in order to encourage meeting participation by trainees with primary
child/family care responsibilities. This is extended to other non-traditional family support needs. Top
scoring abstracts will be selected for oral presentations in the Hebert Lecture, and other Renal/ETG-
based session. In 2024, these prestigiouslectureships will recognize Drs. Volker Vallon (Hebert) and
Jonathan Kaunitz (Ussing) for their important contributions to epithelial biology and transport. This
format has proven popular among trainees, as it provides an exciting opportunity for talented early
career physiologists to present their research alongside preeminent scientists in a formal, but
collegial setting. We will continue our “pre-meeting” symposium, which had record attendance in
2023. This will provide additional opportunities for junior investigators to orally present their work
in a less formal atmosphere, with networking coffee breaks, lunchesand networking sessions. A
revised, interactive area framed as “The Hub”, will serve as a meeting point for ETG-related Renal
research, and provide an area for flash-talks, discussions and networking amongst prominent
scientists. This will include the “Meet the Experts” sessions. Given ETG’s commitment to diversity
and trainee mentoring, we believe that the support provided by this application will dovetail with the
proposed meeting structure to enhance career development of early career researchers interested
in epithelial physiology. Together, this will serve our long-term goal of maintaining the pipeline
of epithelial biologists in biomedical research careers related to the goals of KUH."

The objective of the proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to
support Dr. Tanya Saraiya in acquiring the skills necessary to become an independent clinical researcher with a
program of research focused on the modification and implementation of interventions for opioid use disorder
(OUD) and comorbid mental health conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Up to half of
individuals with OUD have PTSD, but to date, there are no established evidence-based behavioral interventions
that concurrently address OUD and PTSD symptoms. The proposed study directly addresses this major clinical
gap by testing whether augmenting medications for OUD with an adapted, trauma-focused, integrated behavioral
treatment for substance use disorders and co-occurring PTSD (i.e., Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and
Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure; COPE) will enhance clinical outcomes. In Aim 1, we will
modify the existing 12-week, COPE intervention to individuals with OUD and PTSD using an iterative process
informed by provider and patient feedback. In Aim 2, we will conduct an open-label trial (n = 5) to further refine
and finalize the treatment protocol. In Aim 3, we will test COPE combined with medications for OUD (MOUD)
versus MOUD-only in a randomized clinical trial among 76 individuals with OUD and PTSD to evaluate feasibility
and preliminary efficacy in reducing opioid use and PTSD severity. During Aim 3, both groups will complete
ecological momentary assessments (EMA) to assess for daily opioid use, craving, and PTSD symptoms. EMA
will allow us to assess for the associations between daily PTSD symptoms and opioid craving and use, which
may then inform treatment development. Dr. Saraiya has assembled a team of renowned mentors with expertise
in OUD, PTSD, clinical trials, medications for OUD, and EMA. On-site mentors (Drs. Sudie Back and Kathleen
Brady) have extensive knowledge in conducting clinical trials of behavioral and pharmacological interventions
for co-occurring substance use disorders and PTSD. Off-site mentors (Dr. Katherine Mills at the University of
Sydney and Dr. Kenzie Preston at NIDA) will provide guidance on how to modify the integrated intervention and
leverage EMA methods to an OUD population. The mentorship and hands-on training afforded by the proposed
K23 award will ensure that Dr. Saraiya achieves the following career goals: (1) a solid knowledge base in OUD
and PTSD treatment; (2) proficiency in the design, evaluation, and implementation of clinical trials for OUD and
PTSD; (3) experience with the implementation of EMA and skills in longitudinal analysis; (4) advanced training
in the responsible conduct of research; and (5) stronger skills in manuscript and grant writing. The candidate will
complete the proposed K23 activities at the Medical University of South Carolina, which has a strong track record
of commitment to the advancement of early stage opioid use investigators. The proposed K23 activities will
ultimately prepare Dr. Saraiya to lead a program of rigorously designed treatment research on OUD."

Human cancers that contain the rearranged-during-transfection (RET) oncogene respond poorly to immune
checkpoint inhibitors, but have high response rates to the potent and reasonably selective RET protein tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) selpercatinib and pralsetinib. While selpercatinib and pralsetinib can inhibit RET V804M/L
gatekeeper mutants, which are resistant to all other publicly known RET TKIs, the RET G810C/R/S solvent-front
mutations have been identified as the major on-target resistant mechanisms to both selpercatinib and pralsetinib.
We recently found that TKIs containing alkynyl nicotinamide scaffold were more drug-like than did the
corresponding alkynyl benzamides. Through our collaboration, we identified several nicotinamide-based lead
compounds that potently inhibit RET, its gatekeeper, solvent front, and roof mutants with selectivity against
VEGFR2 and are orally available. These are highly desirable properties for a next-generation RET inhibitor. The
long-term goal of this collaborative project is to further characterize the novel nicotinamide-based RET TKIs in
order to develop a best-in-class, next-generation potent and selective RET inhibitor that can be used to treat
acquired selpercatinib- and pralsetinib-resistant patients in addition to use as the first-line drug for RET-altered
cancers. In this project, we will select the best lead compounds through multi-parametric characterization and
structure-activity relationship optimization (Specific Aim 1); establish the absorption, distribution, metabolism,
excretion, and toxicity (ADMET)-pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of
selected compounds (Specific Aim 2); and evaluate PD biomarkers of kinase inhibition and anti-tumor efficacy
of down-selected RET inhibitors in subcutaneous and intracranial tumors derived from engineered and human
cancer cell lines, in lung tumors of transgenic mice, and in RET-altered cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)
(Specific Aim 3). Through this collaborative, novel multi-parametric selection and optimization effort that
incorporates both in vitro and in vivo properties, we expect to obtain one or more potent and selective RET TKIs
that are effective on selpercatinib- and pralsetinib-resistant RET mutants and are orally bioavailable with
intracranial activity for further clinical development. This will facilitate the effort to increase the duration of tumor
response to treatment towards the goal of turning a currently incurable malignancy into a manageable chronic
condition, and ultimately a cure."
10915427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Defects in programmed cell shape changes during embryonic development can disrupt organ morphogenesis
and cause structural birth defects. There are fundamental gaps in our understanding of how cells change their
shape during organ formation. While the biochemical signals and morphogen gradients that help govern
organogenesis are well-studied, evidence is growing that robust control of organ form and function often also
depends on multiple mechanical mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to
tease apart how multiple mechanisms – including tissue-scale dynamic forces and cell-autonomous
contractile forces – work together to generate “mechanical gradients” that program cell and organ
shape during organ formation. A challenge is that mechanical perturbations that affect the entire embryo
often result in the same global phenotype, making it difficult to pinpoint the role of each mechanism. Our long-
term goal is to develop a combined cell biology and modeling toolkit that allows us to predict cell-scale
phenotypes and appropriate perturbations that can be used to distinguish between multiple mechanical
mechanisms. This project uses Kupffer’s vesicle (KV), a transient epithelial organ that establishes left-right
asymmetry in the zebrafish embryo, as a model system. No upstream biochemical signaling gradients have
been identified that regulate KV cell shapes as required for left-right patterning, but multiple mechanical
mechanisms have been implicated. Preliminary results – from (4D = 3D + time) experimental perturbations and
measurements of single KV cell shapes, and novel mathematical models that simulate interacting 3D tissue
structures while retaining cell-scale resolution – lead us to formulate our central hypothesis that cell shape
changes critical for KV organogenesis result from mechanical gradients generated by interactions between the
KV and surrounding tissue structures as well as cell-autonomous contractile forces from inside KV. The goal of
Aim 1 is to determine how interactions between KV and notochord impact cell shape changes. 4D modeling
predictions for cell shapes and cell movement combined with live in vivo imaging and localized laser ablations
will determine how asymmetric forces generated by the rod-like notochord impact KV cell shape changes
during organogenesis. The goal of Aim 2 is to understand mechanisms by which actomyosin contractility in
surrounding tailbud cells and inside KV generate KV cell shape changes. Novel mathematical models will
predict how localized optical perturbations to tailbud mechanics, as well as perturbations to volume and cell-
autonomous contractility in cells inside the KV, affect KV organ shape. Key outputs include a modeling toolkit
for high-throughput simulations of dynamic interactions between complex 3D tissue structures complemented
by a cell biology toolkit that tests model predictions with spatially and temporally modulated activation of
biomechanical and biochemical signaling molecules. These results will pinpoint mechanical mechanisms that
regulate organogenesis, and may ultimately aid in the prediction or prevention of birth defects."

Our overarching goals are: i. to define the mechanism(s) of ATM activation by the Mre11 complex; ii. to
define the role(s) of the Mre11 complex in DNA replication; iii. To define the role(s) of the Mre11 complex in
response to DNA replication stress. As part of the emphasis of DNA replication stress, our focus includes
RTEL1 which acts to mitigate replication stress at the telomere. A combination of yeast and mouse genetics,
biochemistry, and structural biology are employed to address these issues. Our previous work on these topics
led to substantial scientific progress and insight regarding processes relevant to human health. Specific areas
of inquiry are:
 • Genetic screens in yeast and mining of cancer genomic data revealed separation of function Rad50
 mutations that affect ATM dependent DNA damage signaling without affecting the DNA repair functions
 of the Mre11 complex. These mutations constitute a resource for deciphering the mechanism by which
 the Mre11 complex activates the ATM kinase to initiate DNA damage signaling.
 • We have modeled three recurrent tumor borne mutations in mice that were confirmed to be
 hypomorphic for ATM activation but proficient in DNA repair. These animal models offer a unique
 opportunity to delineate Mre11 complex-dependent ATM functions.
 • We have identified factors that function at the DNA replication fork in a manner that depends on the
 Mre11 complex. An important focus of our laboratory is to understand the functional role(s) of those
 factors. Defects in factors that promote accurate DNA replication are highly correlated with human
 disease, and so understanding this fundamental process is an important priority in our work.
 • Whereas the Mre11 complex functions at the replication fork, RTEL1 is a helicase that promotes
 accurate replication of telomeric DNA. We have discovered that RTEL1 influences the abundance and
 disposition of a long non coding RNA, called TERRA, that is transcribed from the subtelomeric regions
 of all eukaryotes. Our goal in this aspect of our work is two fold. First, to understand the role of RTEL1
 in maintaining telomere stability. Second, to use that information to shed light on the function of
 TERRA, which is a long standing question."
10915631,"Translational Training in Aging and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Disorders
This renewal application seeks to sustain our T32-supported Training Program to continue training postdoctoral fellows in the conduct of translational research focused on optimizing cognitive and physical function with aging and Alzheimer’s disease-related disorders (ADRD). This T32 has been continuously funded since 2009; in November, 2019, its scope and number of trainees increased from 3 to 5 fellows to include specific training in research related to ADRD, in alignment with the newly funded P30 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Of the 19 trainees appointed or who are pending appointment since the T32 began in 2009, 10 have an ADRD focus (53%). Of the 9 trainees appointed or who are pending appointment since the T32 was revised to include an ADRD focus in 2019, 6 have an ADRD focus (66.7%).Nationwide, there is a dearth of competent investigators trained in the appropriate skills to conduct research on prevention and treatment of mobility disability, ADRD, and other conditions that lead to loss of independence with aging. Thus, the research of our T32-supported trainees has been, and will continue to be, instrumental in advancing knowledge regarding the prevention of cognitive and functional disability and the best health care for older adults. The overall goal of our T32 Training Program is to help develop a new generation of researchers by providing an integrated career development path centered on training PhD/MD fellows in the skills and competencies needed to conduct translational research with a focus on the prevention of physical and cognitive disability. Importantly, the unique and seamless integration of both aging and ADRD research within the Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) Section on Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine, and the supporting ADRC and Pepper Older Adult Independence Center, provides the ideal environment to facilitate trainees’ knowledge of the biological contributions and risk factors for aging- and ADRD-related changes in physical and cognitive function, and their inter-connectedness. Our scholars acquire 1) scientific knowledge in the fields of aging and brain biology, geroscience, and ADRD; 2) competencies needed to successfully and ethically conduct preclinical experiments, clinical trials, and/or longitudinal cohort studies of relevance to aging and ADRD; 3) experience and expertise in the measurement of cognitive and/or physical disability outcomes; and 4) specific technical or methodological skills in line with their individual interests. This training will place them in a position to successfully transition to an early-stage faculty position and to be highly competitive for new funding to continue their path towards independence. With a current research portfolio of funded grants totaling $73.96 million in direct costs ($55.7 million from NIA) awarded to our T32 Program Faculty, we have the scientific expertise, resources, and research opportunities available for training the next generation of investigators for success in aging and ADRD research."
10914467,"Project Abstract - Fishing Partnership Support Services – Safety Training in New England
 Fishing Partnership Support Services (FPSS) will continue to use a community-based model to implement
safety training programs that are practical; meet multiple health and safety needs; and reduce the risk of
injuries and fatalities within the commercial fishing industry. From 2005-2014, the three most dangerous
fisheries in the U.S. were on the East Coast. Despite the dangers of their profession, most fishermen on the
East Coast have not received the safety training needed to reduce their risk of injury, illness, and death due to
lack of training opportunities; lack of access for isolated fishing communities; lack of safety training instructors;
financial constraints; lack of awareness of danger; and cultural reluctance to change. FPSS's program will
exert a sustained, powerful influence on the field of occupational safety training by increasing both the supply
and demand for safety training in New England; increasing capacity to deliver training throughout the
commercial fishing industry; and bringing innovation and evaluation to every level of the training.
 FPSS will utilize NIOSH grant funds to fulfill the following objectives: Objective #1: Enhance the quality
and availability of safety training that addresses the needs of fishermen, by offering Safety & Survival Training
and Drill Conductor Certification Training. Newly developed training components will include Man Overboard
Recovery Devices. FPSS will offer 30 training sessions over three years in New England states. Objective #2:
Create a demand for training from within the community by promoting a culture of safety. This will result in
more fishing communities recognizing safety as a top priority. FPSS will partner with apprentice programs that
develop to provide safety training to young fishermen. Objective #3: Increase training capacity by offering
AMSEA's Marine Safety Instructor Training (MSIT) locally and certifying up to 18 new safety training
instructors.
 To evaluate the quality, effectiveness, and impact of the proposed safety training, FPSS will engage
internal and external evaluators in a multi-method approach that includes quantitative and qualitative data
collection, and the use of secondary data sources. Outcomes include: 1: Participants engage in safer
behaviors/practices in their work; 2. Participants maintain a positive attitude toward safety; 3. A culture of
health and safety is created; 4. The numbers of accidents, injuries and fatalities are reduced; and 5. USCG's
search and rescues costs decline. For Research to Practice (r2p) FPSS' evaluation team will engage multiple
stakeholders to identify research needs and questions; design evaluation tools and conduct studies; and
translate and share knowledge, interventions, and evaluation learnings with five key audiences: fishing leaders;
other safety training programs, including NIOSH funded programs; law enforcement, including the U.S. Coast
Guard; state and federal policy makers; and fishing safety researchers."
10916367,"ABSTRACT
Pregnancy is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women with rheumatic diseases and their children;
thus, one of the most important decisions that a woman with a rheumatic disease may make is if and/or when
she wishes to conceive. However, my foundational work has found that many of these women are unable to make
informed decisions around pregnancy because their information needs are unmet. To meet this immediate and
urgent patient need, I will develop a novel, patient-facing decision aid called MyVoice to help women to make
informed pregnancy decisions and augment family planning care receipt in the rheumatology clinical setting
(Aim 1). I will pilot MyVoice in rheumatology clinics to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and implementation
potential (Aim 2). This work will serve as the foundation for a future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial
to evaluate if MyVoice increases women’s disease-specific reproductive knowledge and family planning care
receipt, and ultimately improves their downstream reproductive outcomes.
One of the major predictors of adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes among women with rheumatic diseases
is active disease at the time of conception and during pregnancy. My prior work suggests that some women may
experience active disease during pregnancy because they decide not to adhere to pregnancy-compatible anti-
rheumatic drugs; they fear that their medications might adversely affect fetal development. In Aim 3, I will
develop a longitudinal, exploratory cohort of young women with rheumatic diseases to evaluate how medication
adherence is influenced by key time-varying and time-invariant upstream risk factors (i.e., pregnancy intentions,
reproductive knowledge, symptom severity, family planning care receipt). In a subsequent R01 study, I will
assess how these upstream factors lead to healthy or adverse reproductive outcomes-- thus, positioning me to
identify novel targets for interventions that may enhance reproductive outcomes. I will maintain and expand this
cohort over my career to serve as a source of additional hypotheses and scientific inquiry.
Eighty percent of patients with rheumatic diseases are women, many of whom are reproductive-age when they
are diagnosed; thus, my Aims are highly clinically relevant to rheumatology patients and practitioners. This K23
project will generate new knowledge that may be used to enhance the reproductive outcomes of a vulnerable
group of women and their children. These Aims will also help me to meet my career objectives through
development of a skill set that includes patient-centered intervention development, conduct of clinical trials,
practical implementation, cohort creation, and advanced growth curve modeling to evaluate time-varying risk
factors in my proposed cohort. My project provides preliminary data for two distinct but complementary paths
to R01 funding. My outstanding mentorship team will support the successful completion of my Aims and career
development milestones, to facilitate my transition to an independent outcomes researcher in rheumatology."
10916761,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a single-gene disorder, affecting ~100,000 Americans and millions worldwide.
Existing pharmacological treatments may alleviate SCD severity but do provide a cure for SCD patients, and the
chronic transfusion therapy poses challenges due to alloimmunization and iron overload risks. Currently, the only
curative therapy for SCD is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), typically from a matched
related donor, which is available to only ~15% of SCD patients. Recently, gene therapy and gene editing-based
autologous HSCT have emerged as potential curative avenues, offering an alternative approach to address
donor availability and graft-versus-host disease. Several CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing based therapies for SCD
are currently in clinical trials, by inducing fetal hemoglobin through BCL11A erythroid-specific enhancer targeting
or correcting the sickle mutation on the beta-globin gene (HBB). Although these SCD clinical trials show promise,
our recent studies found that three of the CRISPR gRNAs designed for treating SCD all induced unintended
large gene modifications with high frequencies at the Cas9 on-target cut-sites in SCD HSPCs, including large
deletions (LDs), insertions and complex local rearrangements. Given that two of these gRNAs (R-02 and
BCL11A) are being used in the ongoing clinical trials, it is imperative to comprehensively assess the biological
and clinical implications of these unintended gene modifications, and establish new strategies to mitigate
potential adverse effects, which are the primary goals of the Parent R01 grant. This Diversity Supplement will
expand upon the research proposed in the Parent R01 by supporting an underrepresented minority student to
conduct gene editing research for treating SCD. Aim 1 of this Diversity Supplement aims to expand the first aim
of the Parent R01, to determine the consequences of small indels, especially the frequencies and genotype-
phenotype relations of small in-frame indels at the Cas9 cut-site in HBB. Aim 2 of the Diversity Supplement will
expand Aim 3 of the Parent R01 to investigate the possibility of enhancing homology directed repair (HDR)
through the modulation of DNA repair pathways using small molecules, while simultaneously reducing LDs and
small in-frame mutations. It is expected that the studies supported by the Diversity Supplement will help establish
a better understanding of the consequences of HBB gene editing by CRISPR/Cas9, thus facilitating the
translation of genome editing based treatment of SCD."
10914339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an enduring global public health challenge, affecting
approximately 300 million individuals, despite prophylactic vaccines. The current FDA-approved anti-HBV drugs
suppress viral replication but are unable to eliminate the viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) genome
within infected hepatocytes. Restoring the immune response holds promise as a potential avenue toward a cure;
however, T-cell exhaustion commonly observed in chronic HBV-infected patients impedes effective viral
clearance. Regrettably, progress towards curative treatments has been stymied by the scarcity of appropriate
immunocompetent animal models susceptible to HBV.
 HBV exhibits high species specificity, infecting only humans and chimpanzees. Mice, widely used for
modeling human diseases due to their well-characterized immune system, high reproductive capability, and short
gestation period, are not naturally susceptible to HBV infection, even after expressing human sodium
taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide, the HBV entry receptor. The primary obstacle to HBV infection in
murine hepatocytes is the inability to establish cccDNA, which is essential for HBV infection and persistence.
Although HBV can infect mice xenotransplanted with human hepatocytes, these models are immunodeficient.
Humanized mice engrafted with both human hepatocytes and human immune cells could surmount this
deficiency, but their immune response tends to be weak and constrained.
 In this study, we aim to identify the host and viral determinants capable of breaching the species barrier
for HBV infection in murine hepatocytes and thereby develop HBV-susceptible mouse models. In Aim 1, we will
take a host-centric approach to determine if alterations in the murine hepatocyte cellular environment can lead
to HBV cccDNA formation. Specifically, we will test whether genetic diversity across mouse strains or diversity
induced by functional genomics approaches renders murine hepatocytes more permissive to HBV infection and
replication. In Aim 2, we will take a virus-centric approach to determine the role of nucleocapsid uncoating in
cccDNA formation within murine hepatocytes. We will also exploit the power of viral diversity to a degree never
attempted with HBV to select viral variants capable of forming cccDNA in mouse hepatocytes.
 The proposed experiments have high reward potential. There is an inherent risk; however, the risks are
more than justified because a simple mouse model would be accessible to scientists around the globe and
accelerate research. We designed most experiments so that regardless of the outcome, the results will provide
valuable novel insights into HBV host tropism and develop new technologies. We expect these efforts will
ultimately lead to the creation of a fully HBV-susceptible immunocompetent mouse model that is suitable for
developing therapeutic strategies, including immune perturbations, to promote a functional cure."
10916176,"The proposed renewal is for a continuation of the present Multidisciplinary Training
Program in Lung Disease (HL-07185), which provides training in basic and clinical
sciences important to the respiratory system. The program draws on the basic and
clinical research skills of the broad group of faculty at UCSF addressing questions
directly relevant to lung biology and disease. The grant is to accommodate a total of
thirteen postdoctoral trainees, including both MD's and PhD's. The main program is an
actual research experience under the close supervision of a Preceptor and a review
committee selected on the basis of the experimental approaches of the trainee. These
approaches include disciplines applicable at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, whole
animal, clinical, or population levels. In addition, considerable emphasis is placed on
special educational opportunities that have been created to prepare individuals for a
diverse range of careers in academic medicine. The educational program provides
small group conferences and seminars and coursework in basic sciences, biostatistics,
epidemiological study design, medical economics, and responsible conduct of research.
Training in methods to enhance reproducibility, with an emphasis on rigor in literature
review and study design and analysis, appropriate inclusion of important biological
variables and authentication of key reagents is woven into all aspects of the training
program. Emphasis is placed on personal instruction specifically designed for individual
trainees and there is a formalized career development planning process with multiple
layers of oversight. Considerable emphasis has been placed on multidisciplinary
interaction in research and training, and on developing and implementing academic
careers in areas of scientific need, especially in those previously underemphasized.
Emerging areas of growth in our program include single cell genomics, synthetic biology,
the biology of the microbiome, health disparities and the social determinants of health.
An additional important area of emphasis is the recruitment and retention of
underrepresented minorities and women in the program. The past and future success of
our multidisciplinary program is predicated on a close collaboration among a widely
diverse faculty, including clinical and bench-oriented scientists and translating this
collaboration to a coordinated approach to research training and career development."
10916209,"1 Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) have significantly improved outcomes in many tumor types, but there is still
 2 immense room for improvement. A tremendous amount of preclinical and clinical research thus is aimed at
 3 evaluating combination therapeutic regimens that may increase CPI response rate as well as identifying
 4 biomarkers that indicate whether a patient will benefit from or be resistant to immunotherapy.
 5 Cryoablation is a promising adjunctive strategy that may be able to significantly increase the CPI response
 6 rate. Cryoablation of a single metastatic focus causes necrotic cell death, rupturing cell membranes through
 7 alternating freeze and thaw cycles. Tumoral antigens are released along with inflammatory intracellular
 8 contents. This markedly inflammatory reaction activates dendritic cells to take up the released tumor antigen
 9 which, in turn, activates the adaptive immune system to attack tumor sites elsewhere in the body.
10 I have developed a dual-implanted tumor model to investigate the systemic benefit of adjunctive cryoablation
11 and have found that when added to CPI therapy cryoablation significantly increases the complete response
12 rate of the non-ablated tumor relative to CPI alone. As adding cryoablation to CPI is minimally studied, there
13 remains significant work to identify biomarkers to determine which tumors will benefit most by cryoablation
14 addition. To identify response biomarkers I am helped by a unique investigative tool that I co-invented,
15 granzyme B PET imaging. Localizing to the site of active immune-mediated tumor killing, granzyme B PET
16 allows us to distinguish CPI responders from non-responders prior to changes in tumor size. We can then
17 interrogate the immune-response while it is still active, facilitating unique insights.
18 In this proposal, in a murine tumor model I will develop an optimized preclinical cryoablation and CPI regimen
19 across multiple tumor lines reflective of the range of CPI responsiveness. In these models I will then use
20 granzyme B PET imaging to help identify genomic and non-genomic biomarkers of response and identify
21 mechanisms of resistance to the combination of cryoablation and CPI. I will also simultaneously be leading a
22 clinical trial evaluating the ability of cryoablation to increase pembrolizumab response in metastatic urothelial
23 carcinoma. From patient blood and biopsy specimens obtained at the time of cryoablation I propose to analyze
24 the tumoral and systemic immune microenvironment for response biomarkers in these patients. These data will
25 be essential to guide the development of future optimized clinical protocols evaluating the ability of cryoablation
26 to increase systemic immunity across multiple tumor types. I will conduct this research in the excellent
27 research environment of MGH, guided by mentors expert in the fields of immunology, immuno-oncology, and
28 interventional radiology. Their guidance will help ensure the success of this project and my successful
29 transition to an independent research career."
10916213,"Project Summary
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue that is associated with
sleep dysfunction and reduced function that affects 2-4% of the population (Heidari et al., 2017). Current 2016
diagnostic criteria are by symptomology only, as there are no validated chronic pain biomarkers to assist with
diagnosis, or treatment evaluation endpoints (Wolfe et al., 2016). Diagnosing FM often takes years with
patients seeing multiple physicians, which delays treatment (Choy, 2010). This delayed diagnosis and
treatment initiation would be dramatically reduced with the identification of FM biomarkers. The long-term goal
of this line of research is to identify unique biomarkers for FM to improve the diagnosis and/or develop
therapeutic targets for individuals with widespread pain. Using a semi-targeted metabolomics approach, our
preliminary data from women with FM (n=59), compared to healthy controls (n=38), show 18 potential
candidates that differ significantly between cohorts with several metabolites showing good-excellent sensitivity
(>90%) and specificity (>90%). The primary goal of this proposed research is to assess and validate
candidate metabolic biomarkers in a new, larger cohort of individuals and compared to other chronic pain
populations. The proposed study will use a multi-site, cross-sectional design to identify and characterize
metabolic biomarkers, biosignatures, and their associations with multiple symptomology domains to address
the following two specific aims: Aim 1: We will characterize diagnostic test metrics for candidate biomarkers
using receiver operating curves (ROCs), i.e. sensitivity and specificity, and test-retest reliability, to correctly
identify individuals with FM from healthy controls and other chronic pain conditions: osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel
syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis. Aim 2: We will determine associations between putative metabolic
biomarkers and multiple self-reported symptom domains in those with FM: a) pain; b) fatigue; c) sleep; d)
physical function; e) psychological factors, and f) disease impact/disability. We have identified several
promising metabolic biomarkers that may serve as diagnostic or within-disease phenotype identifiers. Once
completed, we will examine potential mechanistic and therapeutic targets for the candidate biomarkers in
subsequent studies. These novel studies have the potential to identify a diagnostic, and potentially a
therapeutic, biomarker of FM associated with cell metabolism. To accomplish this study, we have developed a
strong multidisciplinary and multi-site team, leveraging blood samples and phenotype data collected as part of
an on-going funded study, as well as additional data collection for repeatability analyses. The study team has
the necessary expertise in human, basic science and metabolomics investigations to successfully complete
these aims."
10916410,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adipose tissue plays a critical role in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism, and adipose dysfunction
directly links to the etiology of several commonly seen metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus
and cardiovascular diseases. There are several different adipose depots dispersed throughout the body. White
adipose tissue (WAT) is the primary site of the triglyceride storehouse. In contrast, thermogenic fat, which
consists of classical brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inducible beige/brite fat, is specialized for thermogenic
energy expenditure. In humans, individuals with detectable BAT have a significantly lower prevalence of
cardiometabolic diseases, pointing to the metabolic benefits and therapeutic promise of BAT. Thermogenic
adipose tissue can rapidly respond to environmental challenges by modulating cellular compositions and cell-
to-cell interactions. Such adaptation is key to maintaining metabolic health. Intercellular communications within
the thermogenic adipose niche orchestrate adipose tissue development and play an essential role in adipose
tissue turnover, expansion, and remodeling in response to external stimuli. To dissect the complex cellular
makeup of thermogenic fat, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of BAT from mice housed at
different temperatures. The results revealed a high degree of heterogeneity of thermogenic adipose niche and
showed cold exposure induced dynamic changes of cellular composition in BAT. Importantly, we identified a
novel population of adipose progenitor cells (APCs), which was derived from the vascular smooth muscle
(VSM) lineage and uniquely expressed Trpv1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member
1). Lineage tracing studies demonstrated that the Trpv1-expressing VSM-APCs could proliferate and
differentiate into highly thermogenic adipocytes in response to cold stimulation. Work in progress showed that
impaired adipogenic differentiation of Trpv1-expressing APCs resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic
genes in BAT and WAT, suggesting an important role of these cells in thermoregulation. Additional preliminary
data showed that the Trpv1-expressing APCs could respond to local signals and differentiate into thermogenic
adipocytes. These exciting findings have led us to propose a model involving intercellular communications in
which interplays between the APCs and inductive signals shapes adipocyte differentiation and function. In this
proposal, we will test this hypothesis by determining the physiological role of the Trpv1-expressing APCs in
metabolic regulation, identifying the endogenous and exogenous stimuli of Trpv1-positive APCs, and mapping
the cellular interactome of the thermogenic adipose niche using computational tools and spatial transcriptomic
analysis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide new insight into the role of intercellular
communications in the regulation of adipose tissue development and function."

Pathways to Cancer Research Renewal (“Pathways Renewal”) is a renewal of the Pathways
to Cancer Research grant R25 CA221770 awarded to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center (“Fred Hutch”) in Seattle, Washington. It is designed to meet the goals of the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) to broaden participation of
underrepresented populations in science and thereby increase the diversity of the scientific
workforce. This renewal places a strong emphasis on developing two major focus areas across
our Pathways programs - computational biology and cancer health inequities. These areas
of importance were identified by our students and are also priorities of NCI/NIH. We will build on
the prior investments NCI has made in our science education efforts through the YES R25
mechanism, introducing new and innovative components and strengthening our existing
Pathways programs for educators and underrepresented high school and undergraduate
students. We will develop and offer two new virtual high school activities that were piloted in
2021 in response to the pandemic: an outreach program that focuses on using computational
tools to analyze cancer datasets, and a school-year academic research internship. Our aims for
this proposal are to: 1) Provide “Hutch Teacher Fellowship” mentored multi-year research
experiences for secondary science teachers, preparing them to develop curriculum materials
focused on computational biology and cancer health inequities; 2) Expand our “Explorers” and
“Coding for Cancer” introductory outreach programs aimed at increasing the pool of eligible
youth interested in cancer research in general, and computational biology and cancer health
inequities in particular; and 3) Thread opportunities for computational analysis and community
action related to cancer health inequities throughout our “Explorers Virtual School-Year
Internship” and “Pathways Undergraduate Researchers” mentored, multi-year research
internship experiences. Across our programs, we place a strong emphasis on the development
of scientific identity, fostering a sense of belonging in science, and preparing students to
communicate science to their families and communities. Our integrated and holistic approach
builds on the long-standing, robust institutional support for science education at Fred Hutch, our
successful history of engaging and supporting underrepresented students to pursue cancer
research careers, and the strength of our science education staff and scientific faculty."
10916414,"Adipocytes are professional secretory cells. Many adipose tissue-secreted signaling mediators (adipokines) have been identified since the discovery of leptin and adiponectin. As such, much has been learned about how adipose tissue communicates with other organs of the body to maintain systemic homeostasis. Beyond proteins, additional factors such as lipids, metabolites, non-coding RNAs and extracellular vesicles released by adipose tissue participate in this process. However, major gaps still persist in our basic understanding of how leptin and adiponectin achieve their profound actions on target cells. In this renewal application, we focus on adiponectin, a protein we first described in 1995. The previous funding period has shed much light on how adiponectin and its receptors achieve anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and insulin sensitizing effects through the ceramide axis, primarily through gain-of-function approaches. In the proposed studies in this application, we aim to elucidate why adiponectin knock out models generated by different groups give rise to seemingly different metabolic phenotypes. In preliminary studies, we attribute this phenomenon to different strategies for gene elimination. While our own knock out mouse completely lacks all relevant exons for the adiponectin gene, other models leave behind exon 3 that has the potential to encode a non-secreted form of globular adiponectin. We believe it is this remnant fragment that is responsible for the different phenotypes. Furthermore, we believe that endogenous adiponectin, even in the absence of any gene manipulation, may also have a non-secreted, cytoplasmic / nuclear form that exerts unique functions locally in adiponectin expressing cells. In fact, adiponectin is expressed in the proximal tubules of the kidney, specifically in the cortex. We show that adiponectin exerts a major role on renal gluconeogenesis. Adiponectin is also expressed in hepatic stellate cells, where it prevents the activation of stellate cells into fibrotic myofibroblasts. Inducible gain- and loss-of-function experiments will shed more light on the relevance of these phenomena. Finally, we are well positioned to eliminate both adiponectin receptors inducibly in target cells in the adult animal. This has not been possible so far due to embryonic lethality of double-knock out animals. We will focus our efforts initially on the hepatocyte and the adipocyte, in which we will inducibly eliminate both adiponectin receptors. Combined, these experiments will significantly broaden our knowledge of adiponectin function in “non-conventional” areas of metabolism studies. “Non-conventional” in the sense of adiponectin expression in cells other than adipocytes. Furthermore, “non-conventional” in the sense of adiponectin action not mediated through its passing through the secretory pathway, but rather through its actions as a non-secreted fragment in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus. Particularly the latter efforts have been inspired by studies in the various adiponectin knock out models, which have given rise to a large amount of confusing and discrepant data that we aim to explain and clarify for the field."
10917436,"ABSTRACT – TRANSGENIC AND TARGETED MUTAGENESIS LABORATORY
The Transgenic and Targeted Mutagenesis Laboratory (TTML) is a Northwestern University-wide resource
dedicated to the generation, import, recovery/rederivation, and cryopreservation of genetically engineered mice.
TTML provides Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) members a broad range of services including generation of
transgenic, gene edited, and targeted transgenic mouse models via microinjection; gene targeting/editing of
embryonic stem (ES) cells; ES cell microinjection into blastocysts to create germline competent chimera;
importation and recovery/rederivation of mouse lines from germplasm; and cryopreservation of mouse sperm
and embryos. Since the last review, the core has introduced full-scale, start-to-finish mutagenesis capabilities.
These changes were necessary to facilitate the development of newly emerging genome engineering
technologies such as CRISPR. The TTML team works with LCC members to design customized genetic
modification strategies and genotyping assays, and provides confirmed founders to investigators. These new
capabilities, in addition to our traditional methods for creating transgenic and ESC derived mutant lines, enable
investigators the opportunity to employ overarching approaches to genetic modification mutagenesis through the
facility.
The TTML facility is essential for the research programs of investigators of the Lurie Cancer Center who use
mouse models to study mechanisms underlying malignancy and validate targets for translational projects. It
provides the necessary infrastructure that allows the Center’s investigators access to transgenic technology that
normally requires expensive microinjection equipment and skilled staff with expertise in microinjection,
microsurgeries, embryo manipulation, animal husbandry, ES cell culture, and genome engineering. In addition,
TTML staff provide in-house consultation and recurrent guidance on all transgenic-related technologies including
CRISPR-mediated genome editing systems, transgenic and targeting vector design, appropriate screening
strategies, DNA purification methods, breeding and analysis of founder mice, appropriate methods for importing
mouse lines, and cryopreservation options. Since the inclusion of the TTML as a resource within the Lurie Cancer
Center in 1995, Center investigators have consistently been the primary group of NU faculty utilizing the TTML,
emphasizing its pivotal role in the overall research mission of the LCC."
10917437,"ABSTRACT – CANCER EPIGENETICS AND NUCLEAR DYNAMICS
Cancer Epigenetics and Nuclear Dynamics (CEND) is a new basic science research program in the Robert H.
Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCC) that emerged after the re-organization of the basic science programs
in 2015. The goals of the CEND program are to understand how the nucleus is structurally organized and
functionally regulated in cancer cells as compared to non-transformed cells, and to accelerate translation of basic
discoveries in cancer epigenetics and gene regulation to develop new therapeutic and diagnostic applications.
With this focus, CEND brings together faculty from the former Cancer Cell Biology and Signal Transduction
Programs plus six new LCC members. These faculty have a broad range of expertise, and they use diverse
model systems, ranging from yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans to mouse models and primary human malignant
cells. The aims of CEND are to: 1. Understand how genome organization changes during tumorigenesis and
whether organizational changes contribute to tumor progression. 2. Understand how epigenetic regulation
changes during tumorigenesis. 3. Understand how non-coding RNAs affect tumorigenesis. 4. Understand the
relationship between transcription factors and cancer.
The Program is led by Richard Carthew, PhD, Professor of Molecular Biosciences at the College of Arts and
Sciences and Debabrata Chakravarti, PhD, Professor of Pharmacology at the Feinberg School of Medicine.
Both leaders have held program leadership positions in LCC prior to this latest funding cycle. CEND membership
comprises 29 faculty from 9 departments and 2 schools. Current cancer-relevant peer-reviewed direct funding
is $8,175,046, with $2,670,481 from NCI and $5,504,565 in funding from other NIH institutes and peer review
sources. There have been 375 cancer-relevant publications since last competing CCSG review. Of these, 17%
of publications arose from intra-programmatic collaborations, 39% arose from inter-programmatic collaborations,
and 64% arose from collaborations with other cancer centers. 114 (30%) were high impact (>9) publications.
Thus, CEND members effectively collaborate within and outside of the program. Another priority for CEND is to
promote interactions between program members and clinical/translational researchers in order to harness basic
discoveries to develop new therapeutic and diagnostic applications. CEND thus adds significant value to the
cancer center by providing a conceptually renewed and focused framework for promoting clinical translation of
basic discoveries."
10917438,"ABSTRACT – MEMBRANES, ORGANELLES, AND METABOLISM
Membranes, Organelles, and Metabolism (MOM) is a new program that was created during the reorganization
of the Basic Science Division in the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC). The program is founded on the emerging concept
that signaling and metabolic pathways rely on association with a physically interconnected network of cell
membranes and membrane-bound organelles, which are exploited by developing tumors to promote malignant
transformation and progression. Integration of the classic view of cellular signaling as a series of biochemical
reactions with this current perspective provides a clearly articulated focus for an outstanding group of basic
science investigators studying mitochondrial biogenesis and function, metabolism, signal transduction and host-
pathogen interactions. The broad objectives of MOM are to elucidate how cellular membranes and organelles
drive cell response and effector cascades, to determine how tumors and tumor-causing pathogens exploit these
pathways, and to identify pathway components as therapeutics targets. These objectives are pursued in three
specific aims: (1) Understand how cells utilize metabolic pathways to dictate cell proliferation, metabolic
adaptation, and gene expression thereby modulating tumor growth; (2) Define the molecular mechanisms by
which pathogens disrupt and/or utilize host pathways to stimulate tumorigenesis; (3) Determine how signal
transduction pathways initiated from plasma membrane and/or organelles are integrated in cancer cells to
promote tumorigenesis.
The MOM program leader is Navdeep S. Chandel Ph.D., Professor in the Department of Medicine and the
Department Cell and Molecular Biology. He is an expert in cancer metabolism, mitochondrial biology, and
oxidative stress. The co-leader is Curt Horvath, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences,
whose expertise is in mechanisms of cytokine signal transduction and gene regulation in normal and malignant
cells. Drs. Chandel and Horvath lead an interdepartmental cohort of investigators comprising 36 faculty from 10
departments and 3 schools. Between 2013 and 2017 there were 405 cancer-relevant publications from the
program, 71 (18%) of which represent intra-programmatic collaborations and 157 (39%) represent inter-
programmatic collaborations. Work in the MOM program is supported by cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding
of $12,161,291 (direct) with $2,187,789 (direct) from NCI and $9,973,502 (direct) from other peer-reviewed
sources. The MOM program provides its members with the research support, tools, and scientific networking
opportunities to achieve an understanding of how interference with membrane networks and metabolism
contributes to cell transformation and tumor progression. Through MOM-sponsored monthly membership
meetings, workshops, symposia, and seminar series, the program fosters collaboration between program
members and their clinical/translational partners, and links investigators with new opportunities to advance their
research within the LCC."
10917439,"ABSTRACT – TUMOR ENVIRONMENT AND METASTASIS
The Tumor Environment and Metastasis (TEAM) Program of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center
is a multidisciplinary basic science program that evolved from the Tumor Invasion, Metastasis and Angiogenesis
(TIMA) Program to reflect recent conceptual advances in our understanding of tumor cell plasticity, heterogeneity
and immunology. TEAM retains its strengths in areas of cell adhesion, migration and the role of extracellular matrix
in cancer, while adding a new aim in the area of tumor immunology and inflammation. The objective of the TEAM
Program is to elucidate how interactions between tumor cells, immune cells and components of the host stromal
microenvironment mediate tumor development and progression. Toward achieving this objective, TEAM Program
members are addressing the following three specific aims: (1) determine how cells interact with each other and
their matrix, and define how adhesion-mediated signaling events affect tumor cell plasticity, invasion and
metastasis; (2) elucidate the role of the extracellular matrix and the lympho-vascular system in tumor progression
and therapeutic resistance; and (3) understand the role of innate and adaptive immune systems in cancer
initiation and progression, and develop strategies to effectively activate the immune system against cancer. The
TEAM Program has 35 core members from 14 different departments and 3 schools at Northwestern University.
Hidayatullah Munshi, MD, with expertise in cell-matrix interactions and matrix-driven drug resistance, was
appointed as the Leader of the TEAM Program to replace Dr. Kathleen Green who became Associate Director
for Basic Sciences in conjunction with reorganization of the Basic Science division. Carole LaBonne, PhD, who
is interested in understanding how neural crest-derived factors promote tumor progression and metastasis,
remains the co-Leader of the TEAM Program. Program members are highly interactive intra- and inter-
programmatically, collaborating on joint basic and translational research initiatives. During the last budget year,
the TEAM Program received funding of $11,541,419 (direct) in cancer-relevant peer-reviewed grant support,
with $2,275,130 (direct) from the NCI and $9,266,289 (direct) from other peer-reviewed sources. Over the course
of the current funding period, program members have published 411 cancer-relevant scientific articles. Of these,
24% were in high impact journals, 16% were intra-programmatic, 34% were inter-programmatic, and 73% were
inter-institutional collaborations. To successfully achieve the aims of the TEAM Program, future plans of the
TEAM Program include strategic recruitment of faculty, particularly in the areas of tumor plasticity and
immunology, and working with clinical partners to accelerate clinical translation of basic science discoveries by
TEAM members."
10917440,"ABSTRACT – CANCER AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES
The Cancer and Physical Sciences (CAPS) program capitalizes on the unique strengths and international
leadership of Northwestern University in nanotechnology and physical sciences. The program brings together
fundamental chemistry, nano-technology, imaging, and bioengineering groups to develop cancer-relevant
therapeutic and diagnostic agents using nanoscale materials and physical sciences approaches. The resulting
synergies have been leveraged by the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) into the NCI-funded Center for Cancer
Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNE) and the NCI-funded Physical Sciences in Oncology Center (PSOC).
The CAPS Program received “Exceptional to Outstanding” merit at the last CCSG renewal application. Since
then the program has been further strengthened by enhancing the integration of engineering and physical
sciences investigators within the arena of cancer research, developing new strategies and technologies that
facilitate efficient interactions among program members and by accelerating translational efforts. Vadim
Backman, PhD, a bioengineer, is the Program Leader, and Gayle Woloschak, PhD, a biochemist and molecular
biologist, is the Program Co-Leader. This uniquely interdisciplinary program comprises 28 faculty members from
11 departments and 3 schools. Between 2013 and 2017 there have been 417 cancer-relevant publications from
the program members. Sixty-eight (16%) of these publications represent intra-programmatic collaborations, 87
(21%) represent inter-programmatic collaborations, and 207 (50%) represent external collaborative publications.
154 (37%) of the publications were in high impact (>9) journals. Current cancer-relevant funding is $12,212,040
(direct) in total peer-reviewed funding out of which $4,253,788 (direct) is from NCI. CAPS investigators focus
on (1) the elucidation of fundamental mechanisms and molecular pathways that control oncogenesis by physical
science methods, (2) the development of novel technologies for early cancer detection and (3) the discovery and
development of nanotechnology- and physical sciences based tumor targeting agents and therapeutic
modalities. Towards reaching these objectives, CAPS serves as a forum to link basic biological investigation
with practical applications from the fields of chemistry, physics, engineering and nanotechnology. It provides
webinars, symposia and financial awards to stimulate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations on a broad
spectrum of translational projects. CAPS has facilitated the creation of innovative tools for the diagnosis,
detection, and treatment of cancer, including new imaging agents, a new technology for early cancer detection,
and novel therapeutic modalities. A number of these developments have advanced from basic engineering
research to clinical trials and clinical care. CAPS’ future plans are designed to further accelerate discovery and
translation within the LCC through faculty recruitment and bridge building, increasing opportunities for scientific
exchange, and fostering partnerships with industry."
10917441,"ABSTRACT – TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN SOLID TUMORS
The Translational Research in Solid Tumors (TRIST) Program of the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) is a long
standing, highly interactive program that conducts basic, translational, and clinical research centered on the
molecular and cell biology of cancer, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and the development and testing of
novel therapies in preclinical models and clinical trials. The overall goal of the program is to develop more
effective diagnostic and treatment strategies across a wide spectrum of solid tumors in adult and pediatric
populations. This goal is pursued through three program aims: 1) Identify and characterize novel therapeutic
targets based on insights into molecular mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression; 2) Test new
therapeutic approaches in clinically relevant animal models of cancer and 3) Translate scientific discoveries and
preclinical models into novel diagnostic and therapeutic clinical trials. TRIST members possess expertise across
research areas that span multiple solid tumors. These include studies on: 1. Functional development and
therapeutic use of siRNAs and miRNAs; 2. Development and use of novel approaches of drug delivery and
delivery of immune-activating agents and oligonucleotides in tumors using nanoparticles; 3. Defining the role of
cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumor progression and developing approaches to target them; 4. Defining
mechanisms of malignant cell survival and exploiting them for therapeutic purposes; 5. Development of cancer
immunotherapy approaches and other strategies to target the tumor microenvironment; and 6. Understanding
the mechanisms of resistance to antineoplastic agents and developing approaches to overcome it.
This interdisciplinary inter-departmental program consists of 59 members representing 13 departments and 2
schools at Northwestern University. During the current period TRIST program members published 1011 cancer-
relevant publications, of which 310 (31%) represent intra-programmatic collaborations and 289 (29%) represent
inter-programmatic collaborations. 174 (17%) were high impact (impact factor >9). Peer review funding for
program members totaled $14,213,442 (direct) in peer reviewed funding with $7,901,863 (direct) from the NCI,
and $6,311,579 (direct) from other NIH institutes and other sources. Major accomplishments over this grant
period include a 47% increase in NCI funding from $5,380,925 to $7,901,863, renewal of the Prostate SPORE
and U54 Center for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence, two new NCI R35 awards and several successful multi-
PI R01 applications. Clinical trial accrual to interventional studies included 2605 patients, of whom 1557 were
accrued to investigator-initiated interventional trials. The Program Leader, Marcus E. Peter, PhD and Co-
Leaders, Daniela Matei, MD and Jeffrey A. Sosman, MD are well known investigators with distinguished careers
in cancer research and complementary skills and expertise. They work together to foster collaborative
interactions between program members through regularly occurring clinical and research oriented conferences,
retreats and other program activities."
10917442,"ABSTRACT – HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES
The Hematologic Malignancies (HM) Program of the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) combines the talents and
expertise of outstanding basic scientists, nationally recognized clinical researchers, and translational
investigators. The goal of the program is to leverage discoveries from member laboratories into clinical
interventions for the treatment of malignant hematologic diseases. This goal is pursued through two program
aims: a) Identify key pathways that regulate hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis and determine the functional
significance of their alteration in hematologic malignancies, and b) Define molecular therapeutic targets and
evaluate the efficacy of novel agents in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies. Disease specific areas of
focus for program members include acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs),
acute and chronic lymphoid leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. HM members have made significant
contributions to our understanding of molecular and cellular drivers of hematologic malignancies; specifically, in
the areas of epigenetic modification, cellular signaling and gene expression. Translation of these results to
clinical trials is facilitated by an extensive network of collaborative interactions between laboratory-based faculty
and clinical investigators in the program. During the current funding period, such intra-programmatic interactions
resulted in a number of therapeutic clinical trials that were developed from work in investigator laboratories.
This multidisciplinary inter-departmental program has 32 members from 10 departments in 3 schools. During the
current funding period, program members published 520 papers that were relevant to malignant hematologic
diseases. 131 (25%) of these publications represented intra-programmatic collaborations, 91 (18%) inter-
programmatic collaborations, and 68% involved inter-institutional collaborations. 143 (28%) were high impact
(impact factor >9). Peer reviewed funding for program members totaled $5,190,595 (direct) with $2,117,851
(direct) from the NCI, and $3,072,744 (direct) from other NIH institutes and other sources. Program Leader
Elizabeth Eklund, MD and co-leader Leo Gordon, MD have complementary expertise in the areas of laboratory
investigation, translational research and clinical trials for hematologic malignancies. They work together to foster
collaborative interactions between program members through regularly occurring clinical and research oriented
conferences, retreats and other program activities.!"
10917443,"ABSTRACT – CANCER PREVENTION
The broad goal of the Cancer Prevention (CP) program is to reduce the burden of malignant disease through
early detection and prevention. This goal is supported by three specific aims: (1) identify novel strategies for
cancer risk stratification and early detection; (2) discover and develop new devices and therapeutics to reduce
cancer risk; and (3) develop and implement innovative interventions to promote risk-reducing behaviors and
adherence to screening, early detection and cancer prevention approaches.
The multi-disciplinary program is co-led by Seema Khan, MD, a surgeon and translational investigator whose
research focuses on cancer risk biomarkers and novel pharmacologic approaches to cancer prevention, and
Bonnie Spring, PhD, a clinical health psychologist whose research focuses on behavioral risk factors and novel
technology-supported behavioral interventions to prevent cancer. The Cancer Prevention Program's 26 faculty
members from 11 departments and 2 schools, conduct research on primary and secondary cancer prevention.
From 2013 to 2017 there were 405 cancer-relevant publications from CP members, of which 71 (18%) represent
intra-programmatic collaborations, 85 (21%) represent inter-programmatic collaborations, and 333 (82%)
represent inter-institutional collaborations. Total cancer relevant peer reviewed funding for the Prevention
Program is $10,679,123 (direct costs) with $4,345,075 (41%) from the NCI, $5,610,841 from other NIH institutes
and $723,207 from other peer reviewed sources. A total of 8,230 individuals were enrolled into Cancer
Prevention Program studies, with 4,037 enrolled into interventional trials. Among them, 3,971 individuals accrued
to studies of risk biomarkers, 147 subjects accrued to Phase I-II trials of preventive medications, and 1,349
participants to studies of behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk. The importance of this work is evidenced
by: 1) the demonstrated success of cancer prevention agents in reducing cancer risk; 2) the large portion of the
cancer burden that can be attributed to mutable behavioral and environmental factors; and 3) the contribution of
screening and early detection to recent declines in cancer mortality. Better adherence to preventive agents,
promotion of risk-reducing behavior, and improved implementation of cancer screening and risk assessment all
promise to yield rich dividends in reducing the burden of cancer. The CP program actively expands the
capabilities and efficacy of cancer prevention by developing and employing cutting edge technology and
innovative measurement tools and methods for drug- and behavioral cancer prevention interventions. The
program's integrated interdisciplinary focus on prevention provides an environment that fosters intra- and inter-
program collaboration, and has spawned cutting-edge advances in the field."
10917445,"ABSTRACT-COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
A core mission of the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer across all populations, with
special focus and emphasis on the immediate catchment area. The LCC defines its catchment area (LCC-CA)
as the nine (9) counties located in northeastern Illinois (IL) that constitute the metropolitan Chicago area. This
is a dense area of 8.6 million people, accounting for more than two-thirds of the Illinois population, and where
~90% of the LCC patient population hails from.
The LCC works closely with state agencies, communities and local partners to define health challenges and
barriers to cancer care, address cancer disparities that are among the highest in the nation and emphasize
basic, population, clinical and translational research for cancers that exhibit higher incidence and/or mortality in
the LCC-CA. The LCC employs a community-focused approach to engagement and outreach activities with
key stakeholders across the catchment area and catalyzes and supports a broad portfolio of research that is
driven by key needs and issues specific to our catchment area’s cancer burden. This research drives scientific
discoveries across the translational research spectrum from basic science to clinical trials, up to
implementation and community-engaged science, aiming to minimize cancer incidence, mortality and
disparities. In parallel, the LCC engages local, state and national policy makers in advocacy and policy
development, modification and implementation. This comprehensive LCC-CA approach directly addresses the
cancer health inequities that have existed in populations in our catchment area for decades and has resulted in
significant strides over the years, and especially within the current funding period. Going forward, the LCC will
continue to seek to champion the voices of underserved communities, provide tailored cancer education and
outreach, increase access to cancer care that is consistently high quality, and develop hypotheses and
research approaches that target populations facing the highest cancer burden in our catchment."
10917446,"ABSTRACT – DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
Developmental funds provide an essential source of support for the strategic initiatives of the Lurie Cancer Center
(LCC), consistent with its overall planning processes and priorities. In the current project period, we used CCSG
developmental funds in two major areas: recruitment of new investigators and development of one new shared
resource. CCSG funds were leveraged by additional institutional resources and philanthropy to support faculty
recruitment and retention, pilot projects, and equipment and technology upgrades of existing shared resource
facilities. The LCC Executive Committee determines the priorities for the allocation of Developmental Funds and
supplemental institutional support, with input from the Program Leaders and the External Advisory Board, to
ensure alignment with CCSG guidelines and the LCC strategic plan. Eight faculty received CCSG recruitment
support during the current cycle. In addition, during the current cycle, we used CCSG Developmental Funds to
support one new shared resource, the Proteomics Core Facility, which is presented as an established facility in
this application. Although CCSG funding was not used for pilot projects, the LCC invested substantially in
intramural awards. This value-added investment has stimulated and promoted innovative research efforts in
basic, clinical, translational and population sciences research, leading to new extramural grant funding, new
transdisciplinary collaborations and important cancer relevant publications.
Developmental Funds have leveraged additional institutional support and provided a superb return on
investment, with approximately $1 million CCSG funds allocated to new faculty recruits over this grant period,
generating a total of $33.3 million in grants and clinical trials; a 33-fold return on the investment (ROI). The $33.3
million includes $15.7 million in NIH funding, greater than 15 times the ROI of the CCSG funds invested. Given
the continued substantial growth of the LCC’s overall research enterprise, and the successful use of
Developmental Funds in the current project period, we request $400,000 per year to be used in two categories:
1. Recruitment of investigators in areas of strategic priority for the LCC, including cancer
immunology/immunotherapy, cancer epigenetics, cancer epidemiology and drug discovery and development. 2.
Development of a Metabolomics Core that will be of high value to LCC members."
10917447,"ABSTRACT – PLANNING AND EVALUATION
The Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) has a well-developed system for planning and evaluation. As new LCC Director,
Dr. Platanias established a new Senior Leadership team, with well-defined roles and responsibilities: (1) Maha
Hussain, M.D. was appointed as Deputy Director, (2) Kathleen Green, Ph.D. as Associate Director for Basic
Sciences Research, (3) Massimo Cristofanilli, M.D., as Associate Director for Translational Research, (4) Milan
Mrksich, Ph.D. as Associate Director for Shared Resources, (5) Aleksandar Zafirovski, M.B.A., as Associate
Director for Administration and (6) Jeffrey Wayne, M.D. as Associate Director for Clinical Operations. Among the
Associate Directors continuing in their positions are (1) David Cella, Ph.D., for Cancer Prevention and Control
Research, (2) John Crispino, Ph.D., for Education and Training and (3) Alexis Thompson, M.D., for Equity and
Minority Health. This team works collectively as the Executive Committee (EC), which meets every two weeks
and is the primary decision making body that sets the overall strategic direction of the Center. The EC provides
direction in matters relevant to LCC operations, management, and policy and oversees all research activities. It
also sets budgetary and fiscal priorities and reviews LCC membership. CCSG support is requested for all Senior
Leadership positions except the position of Associate Director for Clinical Operations.
In addition to the EC, there are several other governance structures that provide the primary means by which
the LCC conducts planning and evaluation on an ongoing basis. These are the Scientific Research Council
(SCRC), the Clinical Cancer Center Executive Council (CCCEC), the Program Leaders Committee (PLC) and
the Internal and External Advisory Boards. The SCRC includes the Associate Directors and all Program and
Shared Resource leaders/directors, and meets quarterly to review initiatives and provide input for research
programs, shared resources and training/education. The PLC, a new committee established by Dr. Platanias,
meets monthly to discuss joint initiatives within and between programs and provides important input to the EC.
The External Advisory Board (EAB) is comprised of recognized leaders in clinical, basic and population sciences,
biostatistics and center administration, and meets at least annually to review all aspects of LCC operations and
initiatives. After his appointment as Director, Dr. Platanias increased the number of EAB members and made
several new EAB appointments with input from other senior leaders. Additional planning input is provided by
retreats, other Center advisory committees, surveys and ad hoc reviews. With careful planning and critical input
from the different advisory groups, the Director initiated a new five-year strategic planning process, reorganized
center research program membership, and created working groups to continue improving oversight and
governance. These coordinated teams provide critical advice and guidance, ensuring that the LCC most
effectively sets priorities and pursues objectives that promote its mission. CCSG support is requested for the
activities of the EAB, which plays an essential role in the evaluation of the LCC’s programs and organization."
10917448,"ABSTRACT – CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT 
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is overseen by the Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) Clinical Trials 
Office (CTO). The CTO provides a centralized resource to facilitate the development, conduct, and oversight of 
cancer-relevant clinical trials at the LCC. The office manages a large volume of trials, with about 30% increase 
in accrual over the project period (389 interventional trials with 2,367 participants enrolled in 2013, vs. 357 trials 
with 3,059 participants enrolled in 2016). Support services offered to investigators include protocol development, 
regulatory services (including IND submission), study coordination, data management, maintenance of 
centralized record keeping, and multisite coordination. CTO accomplishments over the grant period include 
increased and reorganized staffing to better serve PIs; creation of a Logistics Team; and increased 
staffing/integration of the finance team to reduce study activation times, creation of a web-based tool 
(LaunchTrack) to track key study activation milestones, and improved clinical research education and training 
for CTO staff and PIs. 
Data, Safety and Monitoring activities are an integral part of the LCC's robust clinical research oversight system, 
which is comprised of multiple teams and committees that work collaboratively, including: Disease Teams, 
Scientific Review Committee (SRC), Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and Clinical Trial Audit 
Committee (CTAC). Disease Teams manage clinical trials portfolios, and endorse scientifically sound protocols 
that are submitted to the SRC for scientific evaluation and approval. The SRC is responsible for reviewing 
scientific merit, priorities, and progress of the clinical protocol research at the LCC (described in the PRMS 
section of this application). The activities of both the DSMC and the CTAC ensure that the NCI-approved LCC 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) is effectively executed. LCC serves a 9-county catchment area (CA) 
that represents a diverse community. Minority accrual by ethnicity is robust (~20% accrued to interventional 
trials) over this grant period. Although accrual of African Americans to interventional trials has more than doubled 
since last grant period (from 4.7% in 2012 to 12.3% in 2016) and it closely resembles the percentage of patients 
seen at the LCC, it is below the catchment area proportion. The LCC has developed a series of initiatives 
(detailed in Part 3: Inclusion of Women and Minorities below) to address disparities in accruals among African 
Americans relative to the catchment area. Since the last site visit, the number of analytic pediatric cancer cases 
has increased by 20%, now at 284 cases, and accrual of children remains strong with 129 interventional accruals 
in 2016. In the most recent 12 months, accrual of women to interventional trials stands above catchment area 
rates at 58.9% (51.0% LCC CA population; 51.3% LCC CA incidence; 54.2% LCC patient population)."
10917219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell division is a conserved process by which replicated chromosomes are equally partitioned into two daughter cells.
Errors in this process often result in gains or losses of chromosomes, known as aneuploidy, which can cause and
promote tumors and developmental diseases. During mitotic progression, chromosomes dynamically change their
positions in a force-dependent manner via forces generated at kinetochores, macro-molecular protein structures built
on centromeric chromatin that serves as platforms for microtubule assembly. While chromosome territories, regions
preferentially occupied by specific chromosomes in interphase nuclei, have been established and are known to be
involved in gene regulation and genomic protection, the presence and function of chromosome organization in mitosis
have not been adequately explored. Our long-term goals are to characterize “mitotic chromosome territories” in
mammalian cells and to uncover the function behind spatiotemporal regulation of both chromosome organization and
kinetochore dynamics in ensuring faithful chromosome segregation. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
there exist chromosome organizations in mitosis as in interphase nuclei using a super-resolution microscopy method
we recently developed, which will allow us to identify full sets of individual chromosomes and determine their spatial
organization in mammalian cells. If there exist mitotic chromosome territories, we will explore how and when they are
established and their evolution throughout mitosis. We also hypothesize that major mitotic defects (unaligned
chromosomes, lagging chromosomes, and chromosome bridges) are associated with improper chromosome
organization. We will examine this hypothesis by identifying which chromosomes are involved in each defect with
increased frequency and determine their positionings. Mitotic cells have two major pathways for correcting mitotic
errors, mediated by Aurora A or Aurora B kinases. Both kinases are spatially regulated and phosphorylate a highly
conserved microtubule-binding kinetochore protein, Ndc80/Hec1, to destabilize improper microtubule bindings for
promotion of error correction and regulation of SAC (spindle assembly checkpoint) activity. Aurora A-mediated error
corrections require proximity of erroneous chromosomes to the spindle poles, where Aurora A is concentrated. On
the other hand, Aurora B-mediated error corrections depend on dynamic deformations of kinetochores. These
suggest that mitotic chromosome positioning, coupled with kinetochore dynamics, orchestrate the cooperation
between Aurora A and Aurora B-mediated error correction machineries. We will dissect the contributions of
chromosome positioning and kinetochore dynamics towards Aurora A and Aurora B error corrections using force-
calibrated microneedles and a semi-automated, quantitative microscopy analysis software that we recently developed
called the 3D speckle analyzer (3D-Speckler). Our proposed work will provide new, mechanistic insights into mitotic
chromosome organization and its contribution toward ensuring the integrity of chromosome segregation, which will
contribute towards developing better therapeutic and detection strategies for cancer and developmental diseases for
improved patient outcomes."
10915089,"At present, in the US, one out of every ten infants is born prematurely and many of these babies are admitted to
a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in order to help them survive and thrive. Successful oral feeding is a
requirement for discharging infants home from the NICU. However, an estimated 80% of infants born
prematurely struggle with their oral feeding skills and inadequate oral feeding is the most common barrier to
hospital discharge. The current practice for infants who cannot successfully feed is to remain longer in the
NICU at an average cost of $7000 per day and a national cost of more than $26 billion a year. To address this
problem, NeoCare Innovations, Inc. invented Pedi-Sync, a novel clinical decision support tool for improving
care in the NICU. Pedi-Sync addresses the economic burdens of health care for preterm infants in NICUs
across the US by lowering expenses through cost effective technology. Pedi-Sync optimizes feeding of the
preterm infant as it quantifies an infant’s oral feeding performance, or more specifically a baby’s ability to
coordinate swallowing and breathing while feeding. Pedi-Sync consists of (1) a portable, stand-alone
unit able to measure physiological data (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
waveform variability of transthoracic impedance), (2) a software application housed within the unit that
runs the device’s clinical algorithm, and (3) a mobile app used by clinicians to input oral feeding
assessment data. The algorithm combines the recorded physiological data with the infant’s
demographic information and feeding performance data to generate an oral feeding adaptability score.
The oral feeding adaptability score is a quantitative measure of how well an infant can coordinate their
breathing and swallowing. Specific Aims under this Phase 1 effort will include prototype hardware and
software development, data aggregation, proof of product, and feasibility testing. A cloud-based hardware/
software co-designed platform will be developed and tested. A data collection program that extracts,
compiles, and combines relevant electronic health record data with the infant’s respiratory variability
values and feeding outcome measures will be created. Pedi-Sync will demonstrate feasibility for
clinical use on 30 preterm infants. Completion of the Phase I project will then support a Phase II
program that is focused on prototype testing addressing standard FDA required assessments and
human subjects testing. Pedi-Sync will significantly improve health care by introducing novel and
medically precise technology for NICU care. This innovative device will inform clinical decisions with the
ultimate goal of improving patient care outcomes at a lower cost while enhancing the infant, family and
staff experience. Providing objective data for clinicians to accurately assess and progress oral feeding
skills will result in earlier discharge from the NICU substantially reducing healthcare costs."
10915268,"7. Project summary/Abstract
Recent advances by the two major long-read sequencing companies, PacBio and Oxford Nanopore (ONT),
have enabled complete sequencing of the human genome. As a result, many major genomic research
programs (NIH’s All of Us, T2T consortium, Human Pangenome Reference Consortium) as well as many
genetic testing companies are racing to implement long-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a standard
of care for genetic testing in the near term, and for comprehensive precision medicine programs of the future.
For such an effort to succeed, long read sequencing workflows must be adapted to use high-throughput
automated equipment to reduce overall costs, to improve workflow reproducibility, and to eliminate sources of
operator error. In both long-read technologies, library loading onto the read positions in the flow cell (zero-
mode waveguides in PacBio, pores in ONT) is diffusion-limited, and smaller library elements will be over-
represented in the sequencing output relative to the contribution of longer, more informative library elements.
For this reason, size-selection to eliminate shorter library molecules is widely practiced by users of both
sequencing platforms. Size-selection methods that have been used in long-read library preparation include
size-selective precipitation, customized Ampure bead isolation methods, and automated preparative agarose
gel electrophoresis. Size-selection by preparative electrophoresis is far more effective and flexible than
precipitation or magnetic bead methods, but it suffers from incompatibility with conventional liquid handling
instrumentation. This incompatibility is a challenge for implementing long-read sequencing broadly in biological
research and genetic testing. This proposal seeks to develop a high-throughput, cost-effective gel-based size-
selection system that is easy to integrate with standard liquid handling robotics. The system is designed to be
flexible in physical configuration (capable of operation on or off the deck of a conventional liquid handling
robot), and flexible in size-selection performance, in order to serve size-selection needs of both long-read
platforms. Widespread availability of affordable long-read WGS will have enormous benefits for diagnosis of
genetic disease, but will also impact the development of new therapeutics as clinical sequencing programs
such as the US NIH All of Us program and the UK NHS Genomic Medicine Service generate large sequence
databases with linked patient medical records so that new therapeutic mechanisms and targets can be
identified. The proposed gel-plate system may also have applications in liquid biopsy assays. For instance, it
has been demonstrated that carefully size-selected plasma DNA fractions (smaller than ~150bp) can be
several-fold enriched in tumor or fetal DNA. The proposed gel-plate system could easily be adapted for such
liquid biopsy applications by increasing the agarose gel concentrations and changing the electrophoresis
voltage and time."
10908037,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Achieving sustained viral suppression is the pinnacle of HIV management conferring individual-level benefits
by improving survival and societal benefits through secondary prevention. While there has been dramatic
progress to improve viral suppression among people living with HIV, this progress has been uneven. Globally,
15.2% of the 14.8 million people who inject drugs (PWID) are living with HIV and drug use accounts for 20% of
infections outside of Sub-Saharan Africa. PWID lag behind other populations with viral suppression <20% in
some settings resulting in high AIDS-related mortality and HIV incidence. Long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA
ART) represents a new way to deliver ART that can improve viral suppression in a population where
sociostructural issues such as homelessness and unemployment in addition to substance use complicate
adherence to oral ART. Yet, to date, there has been no serious scholarship evaluating the role of LA ART in
virologically unsuppressed persons (including PWID) particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
Accordingly, our overarching objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness
of LA ART on viral suppression among virally unsuppressed PWID in New Delhi, India. We will utilize a mix of
ethnography, a randomized clinical trial and modeling to achieve these objectives. We will first conduct
ethnographic work to inform clinical trial design. Ethnography will be conducted among PWID living with HIV,
outreach workers and health care personnel. Key topics to be explored during this phase will be attributes of
LA-ART including duration of effect (one week vs. six months), mode (oral vs. intramuscular vs. subcutaneous)
and site of administration (facility vs. field-based). We anticipate conducting a three arm open-label
randomized clinical trial where treatment naïve and treatment experienced unsuppressed PWID will be
randomly assigned at an allocation ratio of 1:1:1 across three study arms – Arm 1: TLD (Tenofovir DF [300mg]
+ Lamivudine [300mg] + Dolutegravir [50mg]); Arm 2: CAB/RPV (Cabotegravir [900mg in 3ml] + Rilpivirine
[600mg in 3ml]); two intramuscular injections at Months 0, 1 and every 2 months thereafter); and Arm 3 –
CAB/RPV/LEN (Cabotegravir [900mg in 3ml] + Rilpivirine [600mg in 3ml] + Lenacapvir [927mg in 2 x 1.5ml
vials]). All participants will be followed for 24 months. The primary short-term and long-term endpoints of this
trial will be viral suppression (HIV RNA<50 copies/ml) at Months 6 and 24, respectively. We will then model the
impact of Treatment as Prevention on HIV transmission in PWID for each study arm by simulating HIV
transmission through injecting and sexual networks based on survey responses incorporating exposure to
other interventions (e.g., syringe service programs) and accounting for the cyclical patterns drug use. We will
extend transmission models to assess cost savings and cost-effectiveness of each of the intervention arms
compared to oral ART. If successful, the findings from this trial can transform the delivery of health care to
PWID globally."
10911106,"This is a Veteran's Administration Career Development Award 2 proposal for Colleen Mills-Finnerty, Ph.D.,
entitled “Causal brain mechanisms of value-based attentional capture in depression.” The goal of this project is
to understand causal brain circuit mechanisms underlying diminished attentional sensitivity to reward in
veterans with depression using computational modeling, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). This is an important area for study because although depression is a leading cause of disability
worldwide, current treatments have limited efficacy. Additionally, TMS is an FDA-approved treatment for
depression, but the mechanism by which it works to remediate symptoms remains unclear. Therefore, better
understanding of the circuit abnormalities that give rise to behavioral abnormalities and symptoms of
depression is needed to spurn development of targeted, neurobiologically informed TMS interventions.
Attentional sensitivity to reward is well-studied in the field of visual perception. Stimuli associated with rewards
(e.g. money, positive social feedback) capture attention (i.e., serve as a distraction) during tasks even when
reward value is not relevant to performance, an attentional bias called value-based attentional capture (VBAC).
More limited evidence suggests that the VBAC is behaviorally absent in patients with depression; however no
studies have addressed the biological underpinnings causal to this process. Understanding VBAC dysfunction
in depression is potentially a critical missing link between reduced reward sensitivity and reward learning
deficits widely observed in depression, and therefore the central hypothesis to be tested is that insensitivity to
reward stimuli in depression is related to failures of circuit mechanisms underlying integration of attention and
subjective value. The current study aims to 1) computationally model VBAC response during neuroimaging in
healthy veterans; 2) computationally model VBAC deficits in veterans with depression during neuroimaging; 3)
use brain stimulation to probe the causal circuit mechanisms responsible for VBAC in healthy veterans, to
model failures of this circuitry in depression. This CDA2 award would allow Dr. Mills-Finnerty to gain
proficiency in 1) computational approaches to modeling behavior and brain function; 2) use of brain stimulation
as a causal intervention to change behavior and understand brain circuit dysfunction in psychiatric populations;
3) clinical research assessment of depression symptoms; and 4) manuscript/grant writing, professional
development, and responsible conduct of research. Training and research for the project will be conducted at
both the VA Palo Alto and Stanford University, which offer excellent intellectual and physical resources to
complete the proposed work. The PI plans to gain proficiency in proposal domains through: 1) tutorials and
meetings with mentors; 2) intensive workshops on modeling information flow within neural circuits and building
computational models of behavior; 3) formal coursework; 4) attendance of professional meetings; 5) practical
application of skills to research data; and 6) planned submission of grant applications and manuscripts.
Insights from the proposed work will improve our understanding of the brain processes underlying VBAC,
which will contribute important mechanistic insight to an understudied aspect of circuit dysfunction in
depression. This project is intended to lead to a targeted depression intervention using brain stimulation to
increase attentional sensitivity to reward in veterans with depression. This approach would constitute a new
paradigm for TMS treatment with potential application to other disorders that impact reward functioning, such
as obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction, and depression associated with neurological conditions such as
stroke and Parkinson's disease."
10911108,"Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Early
stages of sepsis are marked by hyperinflammation driven by proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ,
and TNF). The difficulty in performing hypothesis-driven research in humans justifies the need for a clinically-
relevant, experimental sepsis model. A number of models are commonly used to study the multifactorial
pathophysiology of sepsis, and the dominant mammalian organism used in sepsis research is the mouse (Mus
musculus). While there has been a vast expansion in knowledge regarding the intricate changes that occur
within the immune system following a septic event, virtually all preclinical sepsis research published to date
has relied on the use of mice housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Environmental pathogen
exposure is one important difference between basic human and laboratory mouse biology that must be
considered when using mice to evaluate immune system fitness. Humans are naturally exposed to both
commensal and pathogenic microbes daily from birth, and the immune system of adult humans has been
trained and shaped by each infection and vaccination experienced. While SPF housing of laboratory mice has
been instrumental in increasing experimental reproducibility, it has simultaneously further distanced the mouse
as a model from humans largely because SPF mice live their lives with limited microbial exposure.
This proposal leverages a novel mouse model that mimics a critical aspect of human biology – exposure to
multiple ongoing and resolved infections trains the immune system for robust responses to new pathogens.
Our central hypothesis holds that the exacerbated acute response and mortality seen in septic cohoused
(CoH) mice stems from hyperactivity by peritoneal resident Mf and increased organ dysfunction/damage
stemming from elevated neutrophil responses – largely because of an augmented capacity of these
phagocytes to recognize infection via increased pattern recognition receptor expression. We also posit
microbial exposure via cohousing increases the ‘pathogenicity’ of the gut microbiome, which also contributes to
the increased response by the immune system. In Aim 1, we will define the importance of TLR4 signaling
within peritoneal resident Mf in regulating the magnitude of the acute immune response during sepsis.
Experiments in Aim 2 will define the role played by neutrophils leading to the organ dysfunction/damage and
mortality in septic CoH mice. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will determine how changes in the gut microbiome as
part of the routine treatments for sepsis patients in critical care, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and
interruption of enteral nutrition, lead to the dysfunction of microbiota that increases late sepsis mortality. When
the concepts, preliminary data, and proposed studies in this proposal are considered in sum, this project will
showcase the power of using CoH mice to better interrogate the immunological ramifications of sepsis."
10913317,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Parents’ mental health predicts their young children’s media use. Yet, research often ignores the family
context in which media are used, overlooking the influence of parents as gatekeepers of their children’s digital
media exposure. To address the gap in understanding the causes and consequences of infant media
exposure, the overall objective in this application is to characterize why and how parents use digital media with
and around their infants, and to identify associations with parent mental health and child socio-emotional skills.
The central hypothesis is that instrumental media use (i.e., parents’ reasons for using media) mediates
associations between parent mental health and child socio-emotional skills. The rationale for this project is that
isolation of factors contributing to the family media ecology is likely to advance scientific understanding of and
interventions targeting early digital media use. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims: 1) Describe how parents use digital media to meet multiple needs. 2) Determine the extent to which
parent needs and child behavior predict real-time decisions about parent and child digital media use. 3)
Determine the extent to which parent and child media use mediates associations between parent mental health
and child socio-emotional skills across multiple timescales. The proposed study will examine real-time
fluctuations in instrumental media use among a diverse group of 400 parents of children 1 to 3.99 years old,
employing a multimethod approach to examine within- and between-person effects. Under Aim #1, parents’
instrumental media use will be measured across multiple timescales (annually, daily, moment-to-moment).
Under Aim #2, ecological momentary assessment will be used to examine real-time parent emotions, child
behavior, and media use. Under the third aim, cross-lagged analyses will test for bidirectional, temporal
associations between parent mental health, parent and child media use, and child socio-emotional skills across
the three waves. The proposed research is innovative because: 1) it applies an ecological lens to study infants’
socio-emotional development in the context of digital media; 2) it examines potential mediators of media
effects; 3) it considers both positive and negative uses of media; 4) it uses a multi-method, comprehensive
assessment of the family media ecology; 5) it captures data in real time; 6) it employs advanced longitudinal
data analysis; and 7) it maximizes impact through interdisciplinary, synergistic science. The proposed research
is significant because it will be the first systematic effort to examine the causes and consequences of parents’
instrumental media use with and around infants across multiple timescales. The findings will contribute to
evidence-informed policies and interventions regarding parent and infant digital media use, and be used to
tailor interventions to the specific needs of individual families. Ultimately, such policies and interventions would
support parents’ healthy coping and infants’ socio-emotional development in the digital age."
10909611,"Project Summary
Metastasis is the leading cause of death for cancer patients. Oxidative stress, characterized by excessive
exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS), kills most metastasizing cancer cells. How highly-metastatic
clones manage to overcome both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic oxidative insults to colonize distant organs is
poorly understood. The precise subcellular circuits enabling tumor adaptation to oxidative stress, and whether
they could be exploited for therapy, have remained elusive. We hypothesize that organellar antioxidant
pathways provide adaptive mechanisms essential for cancers to efficiently metastasize. A major impediment to
testing this hypothesis has been the lack of high-resolution and versatile tools to study ROS in vivo.
To address this major technological gap and address which subcellular redox circuits are necessary or
sufficient for highly metastatic tumors to progress, we will develop and apply tools with exquisite
spatiotemporal resolution in vivo. These tools include an optogenetic protein that produces localized ROS in
tumor subcellular compartments, gene therapy strategies in mice that will pioneer the manipulation of tissue-
extrinsic ROS in mouse tissues, and tumor organelle purification strategies coupled to mass spectrometry
analyses in primary and metastatic tumors.
With these tools in hand, this proposal aims to answer three key questions: Can the subcellular burden of ROS
be exploited to hinder metastasis? Are there specific organelle-based nodes that enhance tumor antioxidant
capacity for metastasis? Are extracellular ROS in the colonized target organ a major metastasis limitation? By
integrating in vivo optogenetic modulation of ROS, high-resolution metabolomics, functional genetics and
metastatic cancer models, our work will uncover targetable, ROS-mediated bottlenecks of metastasis at
subcellular resolution.
The tools and techniques developed in this proposal have the potential to revolutionize our ability to study ROS
and oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo, and be broadly applied to any disease impacted by ROS and
oxidative stress. As such, my lab’s work has the power to reshape our understanding of these processes not
only in cancer, but across a wide range of diseases, which may pave the way for new therapeutic strategies
and improved patient outcomes."
10911799,"ABSTRACT
Despite the significant public health impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis
on the HIV-1 pandemic, fundamental questions remain about the biological mechanisms that define the risk of
sexually acquiring HIV-1. Notably, there is no explanation why, after accounting for genetic variants that directly
modify HIV-1 entry and replication (foremost CCR5Δ-32), individuals with documented high exposure to HIV-
1 exhibit diverse outcomes ranging from rapid infection to prolonged natural resistance to HIV-1
infection. A better understanding of these phenotypes could lead to novel interventions to reduce HIV-1
acquisition. We previously identified functional variants (missense/nonsense, untranslated region, or splice site)
in host genes that are strongly associated with altered risk of heterosexually acquired HIV-1 infection. Notably,
genetic variants in CD101 had the strongest association with increased HIV-1 risk, while variants in AXL
had substantially reduced risk. Both genes are thought to regulate host inflammatory responses. CD101
regulates T cell activation and is expressed on many immune cell types. We recently reported that circulating T
cells and monocytes from donors with these CD101 variants, compared to donors without functional CD101
variants, show higher overall cellular activation, but with reduced expression of certain HIV-protective interferon
stimulated genes. In contrast, AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase thought to act through myeloid cells to inhibit
cellular immune activation, possibly through inhibition of toll-like receptor-mediated innate immune responses.
Our overarching hypothesis is that host variation in CD101 and AXL genotypes contributes to altered
inflammatory homeostasis, thereby influencing the risk of HIV-1 infection. Specifically, we hypothesize that
CD101 variants confer a higher risk of HIV-1 infection by increasing the abundance and activation of HIV-1
susceptible T cells, while also compromising their innate antiviral defenses. Conversely, the absence of these
variants, possibly augmented by reduced inflammation conferred by AXL variants, lowers HIV-1 infection risk.
We propose to evaluate our hypothesis in three aims: in Aim 1, we use genomic data from a cohort with well-
characterized HIV-1 acquisition phenotypes to replicate in a second high HIV-risk African cohort that AXL variants
balance the impact of CD101 variants on HIV-1 susceptibility. In Aim 2, we test the epidemiological and
population generalizability of our hypothesis by quantifying the association of CD101 and AXL variation with
susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in two US populations for which genomic data already exist: one that includes
predominantly white men who have sex with men; and a second, ethnically diverse cohort recruited across the
entire US. In Aim 3, we apply molecular techniques to blood and genital mucosal samples archived in a unique
biospecimen repository to directly link the presence of these CD101 and AXL variants with host inflammatory
mechanisms, and ex vivo HIV-1 susceptibility."
10911944,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol is one of the most widely used addictive drugs in adolescence, and continued use can lead to the
development of psychiatric disorders, including alcoholism, in adulthood. Epigenetic processes, such as
histone acetylation and DNA methylation mechanisms, have been shown to play a role in neuromaturation by
contributing to the stability of gene expression during brain development. The Neurobiology of Adolescent
Drinking in Adulthood (NADIA) consortium has revealed that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure
produces epigenetic reprogramming in several brain circuits (prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus
and amygdala) that persists until adulthood and might be responsible for adult psychopathology. These
findings prompt determination of the global epigenome to determine AIE altered specific gene loci within key
brain regions. The Epigenetic/Molecular Core is developed to evaluate epigenetic mechanisms in specific brain
regions linked to key AIE phenotypes in adulthood. The Epigenetic/Molecular Core will also develop tools for
CRISPR/dCas9 approaches for epigenetic editing of target genes to directly link AIE-induced behavioral
phenotypes with molecular mechanisms. The objectives of the Core are to provide tools and scientific
expertise to test NADIA’s hypotheses that perturbations of epigenetic targets due to AIE may lead to
dynamic changes in epigenetic programming leading to transcriptomic changes in key brain areas
(prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain) which are responsible
for persistent behavioral and molecular phenotypes in adulthood. These objectives will be achieved with
the following proposed work: 1) To examine the status of the epigenome at the whole genome level. We will
perform Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) to determine the locations of
open and closed chromatin domains in different brain regions studied across NADIA. The core will provide
information on global chromatin states during AIE to each component and identify “hub” genes related to the
component’s hypotheses for functional studies. 2) To determine gene specific AIE-induced epigenetic
modifications (histone acetylation/methylation/DNA methylation) associated with changes in gene expression.
3) To provide gene specific CRISPR/dCas9 tools for NADIA components. The core will develop and test
CRISPR/dCas9 technologies to make epigenetic editing (activating or silencing) at specific gene locations and
evaluate both functional and behavioral consequences. These studies will provide a better understanding
of AIE-mediated changes in gene expression via epigenetic reprogramming across NADIA
components. In addition, we will be able to identify mechanisms that may lead to the development of
novel treatment strategies for adult psychopathologies resulting from adolescent binge drinking."

One in 3 pregnant women with chronic hypertension (CHTN) deliver preterm from complications of
superimposed preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction (FGR). The specific aims are: 1) prospectively evaluate
the placental longitudinally via functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy pregnant women and
pregnant women with CHTN; 2) extract radiomics texture features in normal and hypertensive placentas and 3)
execute technical refinement toward automated segmentation for regions of interest to delineate patterns in
placental abnormalities. We will study 20 normal pregnant women and 40 pregnant women with CHTN across
gestation. MRI will be performed in the early and late second trimester to assess perfusion via arterial spin
labeling (ASL), diffusion via intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and DWI-
derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping, and oxygenation via T2* from blood-oxygen level
dependent (BOLD) MRI. Radiomics texture features also be extracted from MR imaging and automated
segmentation applied for more subjective placental assessment. This career development award will establish
Dr. Herrera as a clinical investigator focused on non-invasive imaging assessment of placental development
and dysfunction. The award will provide her with the support needed to develop expertise in 3 areas: 1) clinical
research 2) application and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities, and 3) technical skills of post-
processing and deep learning. To achieve these goals, Dr. Herrera has assembled an interdisciplinary team
with expertise in clinical investigation, placental imaging, and post-processing and automated segmentation
techniques. Her primary mentor, Dr. Catherine Spong, has a long track record of successful clinical,
translational, and basic science research including over 270 peer review publications and mentoring faculty to
become independent investigators. The focus of this proposal is on the human placenta. Despite 150+ years of
placental research, the role of the placenta in the pathology of pregnancy-related disease remains poorly
understood. Understanding normal placental development and changes present in placental disease will
provide a foundation to facilitate clinical prediction of pathologic conditions during pregnancy and provide an
opportunity to test interventions. In this study, we will address the unmet clinical need to characterize both
normal placental development and placental dysfunction in vivo. We have chosen to compare normal pregnant
women with pregnant women with chronic hypertension as these women are increased risk for placental-
mediated disease. Successful completion of this project will allow for better understanding of the placenta in
normal pregnancy and pregnancy affected by chronic hypertension. We will also correlate our results with
clinical outcomes of preeclampsia and FGR. Given the increased risk of superimposed preeclampsia and FGR
in pregnant women with chronic hypertension, we anticipate from these results additional insights and novel
hypotheses regarding potential radiomic biomarkers for the prediction of preeclampsia and FGR."
10912619,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent female malignancy and is highly heritable, yet the majority of breast cancer
risk remains undefined. Heritable factors underlie most aspects of breast cancer risk [e.g., incidence, age-of
onset, metastatic progression, and disease-free survival]. In addition to variants that impact tumor cells directly
(i.e., tumorigenicity), heritability is implicated in multiple components of the tumor microenvironment [e.g.,
tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and immunity], which also impact tumorigenesis and progression. However,
the genetic variant(s) underlying differences in the tumor microenvironment have rarely been the focus of
genetic mapping studies and as such, remain poorly defined. In the parent R01 project, we defined these
germline factors and discovered the role of notch-DLL4 expression of 3rd Chromosome on salt sensitive rat as
governing tumor proliferation, metastasis, as well as nanoparticle uptake and therapy response in human
tumor xenografts. These findings were made by leveraging a new model of breast cancer
(termed the Consomic Xenograft Model - CXM) that focused on genetic mapping of strain-specific variant(s)
that impact tumor progression through the tumor microenvironment. A consomic rat is one in which an entire
chromosome is introgressed into the isogenic background of another inbred strain by selective breeding. Thus,
observed phenotypes can be linked to single chromosomes and then further elucidated by comparative
sequence analysis and/or selective backcrossing to yield smaller congenics. In CXM, the consomic and
parental strains are converted to SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency), so that orthotopically
xenografted human breast cancer cells can be tested in vivo. Because the human breast cancer cells are not
varied between strains, any differences in breast cancer progression and metastasis, drug delivery, and
therapy response or resistance are due solely to genetic differences in the tumor microenvironment, not
the malignant cancer cells. We will leverage our discovery of the role of notch-DLL4 expression differences on
nanocarrier uptake, distribution and therapy response, and the consomic and congenic rat strains to assess:
 (1) Define the morphologic features and molecular mechanisms in tumor endothelium which govern drug
carrier permeation, retention and clearance and their dependence on inherited genes (2) Identify the impact of
co-targeting notch-DLL4 in tumor endothelium with three nanoparticle mediated drug delivery systems on
nanoparticle transport, tumor distribution, and therapy response in a panel of representative breast cancer
model systems, and (3) Demonstrate the role of inherited tumor micro-environment targeting for treating distant
metastatic disease in immunocompromised and immunocompetent consomic rat strains. These studies will
provide mechanistic insight to the role of the tumor microenvironment in drug delivery and response to
nanoparticle therapies."

This application proposes the third renewal of Boston University's NIH training program, Translational Re-
search in Biomaterials (TRB). The TRB mission is to train PhD students as interdisciplinary and transla-
tional research scientists and engineers. The TRB trainees acquire a fundamental and quantitative under-
standing of materials, biomaterial-tissue responses, and molecular and cell biology, as well as interdiscipli-
nary training experiences and education that promote discussion and scientific inquiry in areas outside stu-
dents’ “comfort zones,” such as in business and clinical trials. New for this renewal are the following: a jun-
ior faculty mentoring plan, integrated student governance, better data collection, new courses, professional
development workshops, student founded and led translational MInT program, Fireside chats with key opin-
ion-leaders, peer mentoring program pairing first year trainees with senior trainees, and more targeted ef-
forts for underrepresented minority recruitment.
The cornerstones of the TRB program are the curriculum and the program elements that combine interdis-
ciplinary research, quantitative science, engineering, and translational-based courses in clinical trials and
business, with student-organized seminar club, dinners with clinicians, training in professional ethics, indi-
vidual development plans, and professional workshops/ career panels. Our aim is to teach the unique skills
and competencies that are essential to thrive in a multidisciplinary collaborative team striving to meet com-
mon goals in research, development, translation, and, ultimately, commercialization. Since our initial funding
in 2009, 44 students have participated in the TRB training program: 33 were supported with NIH funds and
11 were co-funded by the BU Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemistry. We have accom-
plished our demographic and training mission: 21 women (47%), 23 men (53%), 36% minority, 91% reten-
tion; 100% employment; 22 current students. The TRB trainees have excelled on multiple fronts, including
publications (112 published papers with 57 first-authored; five in review; five in preparation), patent applica-
tions (14), oral (56) and poster (177) conference presentations, competitive individual fellowships (19), and
other awards (27). TRB alumni hold positions ranging from Assistant Professor at Rice University, to a
postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard, to co-founding biomedical start-ups (e.g., Pharmachk). In this renewal,
the continuation of the TRB, with six trainee stipends per year funded via NIH (trainees are supported for
two years) is aligned with the expertise of participating faculty, the availability of a large and strong applicant
pool eligible for and interested in the TRB program (200+ training grant eligible applicants), and an extramu-
ral funding base to provide the appropriate research environment and continued support for NIH trainees
beyond their first two years."
10910551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A basic understanding of human neural circuit design is essential to grasping neurological disease processes
and developing targeted brain therapies. However, due to a shortfall of human experimental platforms,
scientists have investigated neural circuits in model systems that lack the constituent cell types and
organizational principles of the human brain. As a result, we are left with a poor understanding of how human
neural circuits are configured, impacted by disease processes, and targeted for therapeutic purposes. Here our
laboratory will pursue innovative research approaches that specifically advance our knowledge of human
neural circuits. Using live brain specimens collected from neurosurgical procedures and CellREADR, a novel
genetic tool for cellular access, we will investigate the cellular properties and circuit functional roles of human
cortical interneurons. Cortical interneurons are the principal inhibitory cellular elements of neural circuits in
the cerebral cortex, and their dysfunction has been implicated in various brain disorders such as epilepsy,
autism, and Alzheimer’s. While scientists have detailed interneuron form and function in laboratory mice, the
cellular diversity, circuit functions, and pathophysiologies of human interneuron populations remain almost
entirely unknown. Here, using a range of anatomical, physiological, and transcriptomics methods in ex vivo
human brain tissues, we will generate a multimodal phenotypic catalog of human interneurons and
characterize their functional organization in neural circuits. These studies will advance generalizable strategies
for human cellular and circuit neuroscience, while furthermore yielding a fundamental understanding of
human interneurons and human inhibitory circuit design."
10913516,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a highly abundant chromatin-binding protein that recognizes
methylated DNA to coordinate the expression of thousands of genes essential for neuronal function. Mutations
in MeCP2 cause Rett syndrome, a severe neurological disorder affecting one in every 10,000 females and
characterized by psychiatric and motor regression at 6-18 months. Although several treatments are available for
improving some isolated features of Rett syndrome, there are currently no approved therapies that directly
address the underlying defects of MeCP2 loss of function. One primary reason for the lack of MeCP2-targeted
interventions is an inadequate understanding of how MeCP2 reads methylated DNA within hierarchically
organized chromosomes. MeCP2 is known to bind to methylated DNA with a higher affinity than unmethylated
DNA, but how it navigates the main structural form of packaged DNA in the nucleus, nucleosomes, to reach its
canonical methyl-DNA substrate remains unclear. Over 80% of the MeCP2 protein is structurally disordered,
resulting in extensive conformational heterogeneity and binding plasticity that could underlie the regulatory
capacity of the protein, but simultaneously hamper detailed mechanistic characterization of the protein’s
chromatin-binding behavior. To this end, I used a single-molecule platform combining fluorescence microscopy
with optical trapping to directly observe the real-time trajectory and dynamics of individual MeCP2 on DNA and
nucleosomes. This approach enabled the visualization of how MeCP2 navigates the chromatin landscape
harboring methylated CpG sites. I discovered that MeCP2 exhibits long-range, diffusive behavior on bare DNA,
whereas methylation drastically suppresses such motions. Unexpectedly, I also found that MeCP2 preferentially
and stably binds nucleosomes irrespective of methylation status, suggesting that nucleosomes may serve to
regulate the availability of MeCP2 for its canonical methyl-reader activity. Based on my preliminary data, I
hypothesize that nucleosomes regulate the availability of MeCP2 for methyl-DNA recognition and biophysically
modify MeCP2 dynamics and binding configurations on DNA. To test this hypothesis, I will 1) characterize the
dynamics of MeCP2 on DNA with and without methylation, 2) examine the binding and biophysical interaction of
MeCP2 with nucleosomes wrapped with methylated or unmethylated DNA and investigate how Rett mutations
impact this interaction, and 3) determine the structural basis of the MeCP2-nuclesome interaction. Successful
completion of the proposed aims will provide novel insights into how MeCP2 biophysically navigates through a
complex chromatin environment to reach its canonical methyl-DNA substrate at unprecedented spatial and
temporal resolution. My report will establish an experimental framework for systematic interrogation of Rett
syndrome mutations and their impact on fundamental MeCP2-nucleosome and DNA interactions and dynamics."

 Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder that remains undertreated due to poor
adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Several studies suggest that the pharyngeal
airway can collapse at different sites in patients with OSA (velum, oropharyngeal lateral walls, tongue base,
and/or epiglottis). Furthermore, many of the non-CPAP treatments for OSA have been shown to work better for
some sites of collapse than others. The problem is, the site of collapse requires expensive or invasive
procedures, such as drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE). This proposal seeks to solve that problem by
determining the site of collapse from acoustic analysis of snoring sounds.
 In Aim 1, a model for predicting the site of collapse will be developed using DISE with simultaneously
measured snoring sounds in 800 individuals. In Aim 2, natural sleep endoscopy will be performed in a subset
of people from Aim 1 to confirm that the collapsing structure(s) produce the same sound in natural sleep as
drug-induced sleep. Finally, Aim 3 will test the ability to measure snoring sounds in the home environment.
Comparisons will be made between snores from natural sleep endoscopy and natural sleep at home (in the
same individual). Additionally, snoring will be measured at home on separate nights to test reproducibility
across nights.
 The studies in this grant are expected to produce an algorithm for estimating the site of pharyngeal
collapse from snoring sounds. This algorithm could improve the selection of patients for non-CPAP therapies
and potentially increase the number of patients effectively treated for OSA."
10914006,"Abstract: Glial tumors are the most commonly occurring malignant brain tumor in the United
States, among which approximately 20% are glioblastomas, which are the most aggressive and
practically incurable. Drug resistance is often associated with the existence of a discrete
population of cells, which demonstrate a stem-like phenotype. In glioblastoma, these cells are
known as glioma initialing cells (GICs), and their expansion is often linked with tumor recurrence.
Human endogenous retroviral sequences (HERVs) are mobile elements of the viral origin that
comprise nearly 8% of the human genome. In HERVs, like in all retroviruses, genes encoding
viral proteins are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). Serving as promoters, LTRs are
particularly enriched in binding motifs for transcription factors. Importantly, recent studies show
that HERV transcripts are upregulated during early human development, including CNS
development, when cellular pluripotency and stem-like phenotype predominate. Reactivation of
HERV loci are also associated with different tumors, however, the cause and effect relationship
between HERVs and cancer have not been established. Therefore, the effect/s of HERVs on the
development and maintenance of stem-like phenotype in glioblastoma tumors, and the associated
drug resistance, require further investigation. We hypothesize that aberrant expression of HERVs
found in glioblastoma clinical samples contributes to the enhanced glioblastoma stem-like
phenotype and associated drug resistance. We will test this general hypothesis by executing our
experimental plan that consists of two independent but logically connected Specific Aims: In Aim
1 we will determine HERV transcript levels in glial tumors, and analyze if high HERV transcription
correlates with: a) specific glioblastoma subtype: pro-neural (17 months survival), classical (14
months survival), mesenchymal (11.5 months survival), as compared to low-grade gliomas (90%
curable); b) glioblastoma stem-specific transcription pattern. In Aim 2 we will analyze effects of
inducible Crisp/Cas-based -upregulation and -downregulation of HERV transcripts on stem-like
phenotype and malignant growth of low grade gliomas and glioblastomas, respectively. The long-
term objective is to establish the role of HERV transcripts in establishing highly malignant
phenotype of glioblastoma, and to use this knowledge in the development of new therapeutic
strategies against these terminal brain neoplasms."

flow cytometry and high-speed cell sorting services and functional assays including mitogen-induced 
cell proliferation, cytokine production, cell death and survival, cell mediated cytotoxicity, effector T cell 
frequency, and the detection of immune mediators through multiplex approaches. During Phase I of 
the CTVO, CIMC expanded infrastructure and expertise to analysis of cellular metabolism, including 
oxygen consumption and acidification rates, and mitochondrial function in both normoxic and hypoxic 
environments. These additional CIMC services will now support the needs of CTVO Phase II JPIs in 
at least 3 Research Projects. This will allow for expansion of JPI expertise in identifying new 
biomarkers of virus-induced cancers and evaluation of cell growth and cell death responses associated 
with viral oncogenesis and the tumor microenvironment. In addition, innovative approaches, are 
continuously evolving in the CIMC personnel, and will be made available to JPIs and their mentors for 
developing new experimental strategies to explore virus-induced changes at the levels of tumor cell 
signaling, and tumor cell energy metabolism. These advanced technologies have positioned the CIMC 
as the leading laboratory in cancer and immunology in the region, resulting in increased users, 
including CTVO JPIs, as well as CIMC integration as a core laboratory for the LSUHSC School of 
Medicine, and LSU and Tulane Cancer Centers co-located in the Louisiana Cancer Research Center 
(LCRC)."
10914080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to assess the impact of exposure to Superfund-relevant volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) on cardiometabolic disease, the underlying conditions that
contributes to diabetes, cardiovascular and liver diseases. VOCs such as trichloroethylene,
benzene, acrolein, formaldehyde, xylene and butadiene are major chemicals of concern at most
Superfund sites and extensive previous work suggests the exposure to VOC could have a variety
of adverse health effects. Nevertheless, whether exposure to VOCs at levels relevant to
neighborhood adjacent to Superfund sites could adversely affect cardiometabolic health remains
unknown. Our extensive studies with animal exposed to different VOCs suggest that chronic
exposure to low dose VOCs could increase blood pressure, inflict vascular injury, accelerate
atherosclerosis, and induce liver disease. Nevertheless, the cardiometabolic risk of VOCs has
not been evaluated and longitudinal data to interrogate exposure-response relationships are
missing. Hence, to assess CMD risk imposed by VOCs, we will test the hypothesis that exposure
to VOCs exacerbates/induces vascular and hepatic dysfunction leading to a cascade of events
that increase CMD risk. To assess the impact of VOC exposures, we will examine 1200 residents
of Jefferson County, including those who live in areas adjacent to Superfund sites such as Lee’s
Lane and Distiller Farm, as well as high VOC emission, such as the Rubbertown neighborhood.
In each participant, we will assess CMD risk by measuring arterial stiffness, marker of hepatocyte
death, as well as suite of biomarkers indicative of risk for diabetes, cardiovascular and liver
diseases. To determine population-level VOC exposure and its relationship with CMD-related
hospital admissions and mortality, we will establish a network of VOC monitors to measure VOC
levels throughout Jefferson County and monitor domestic wastewater for urinary VOC
metabolites. We will monitor wastewater every other month for 3 years, and assess the extent to
which population-level exposure estimates reflect ambient air VOC levels and individual-level
exposure (Aim 1), and how these estimates relate to population-level and individual-level CMD
risk. To obtain longitudinal data, we will examine CMD progression and determine the
association between individual-level and community-level VOC exposures with vascular and
hepatic function and other indices of cardiometabolic risk. This will help us in assessing how VOC
exposure and/or residential proximity to Superfund sites affects the risk of CMD and this
excessive risk differs from that imposed by background VOC exposures in urban neighborhood.
We expect that completion of this project will lead to the development of quantitative risk models
and rigorous estimates of the additional CMD risk attributable to residential VOC exposures."
10914083,"SUMMARY
Exposure to toxicants has been linked to the development or exacerbation of chronic disease. However, little is
known about how volatile organic chemicals (VOC)—a class of toxicants associated with higher prevalence of
type 2 diabetes (T2D) and stroke—promote the development of cardiometabolic disease (CMD). Accordingly,
the overarching goals of this Superfund project are to determine the mechanisms by which VOCs negatively
impact cardiovascular health and metabolism, identify biomarkers for VOC exposure and vascular injury, and
test therapeutic strategies to minimize VOC-induced CMD. Our studies in the current funding cycle and
preliminary data suggest that VOC such as benzene, vinyl chloride, and crotonaldehyde promote endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) in endothelial cells. Specifically, we
hypothesize that aldehyde metabolites of VOC, which are generally more toxic than their parent compound,
diminish endothelial toxicity by inducing ER stress, which triggers metabolic changes that accelerate ectopic lipid
deposition and promote cardiometabolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we will: (1) examine the effects of
VOC exposure on endothelial function and insulin resistance; (2) delineate the contribution of protein misfolding
to the cardiometabolic toxicity of VOC. The design of these studies includes molecular and pharmacological
interventions designed to detoxify or quench the reactive intermediates evoked by VOC exposure as well as
studies that could lead to the identification of novel, sensitive and robust biomarkers of both VOC exposure and
vascular injury. These studies were designed to synergize with and provide biological plausibility for the
associations identified in Project 1. Successful completion of this project will lead to identification of the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which VOC affect cardiometabolic function and provide
insights into how VOC toxicity could be prevented or therapeutically minimized by targeting aldehydes or protein-
folding pathways."
10914084,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 3)
This proposed work is to advance airborne volatile organic compound (VOC) detection and quantification
technologies, and to robustly characterize indoor/outdoor contrast and in-home determinants for exposures to
target Superfund-relevant VOCs. This research will continue to grow and expand two VOC real-time in situ
measurement platforms developed by the University of Louisville Superfund Research Center established in
2017. One platform comprises small, low-cost sensors that can be deployed alone or in networks. Novel gas
sensors and sensor arrays are being developed to measure target Superfund-relevant VOCs including acrolein,
trichloroethene (TCE), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX). The devices use novel surface
chemistries to address the common challenges of selectivity and sensitivity and are fabricated using
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. Another platform addresses the need for flexibly
designed, field-deployable instruments that can measure with high sensitivity a large range of compounds to
interrogate microenvironments with complex VOC mixtures. The Multichannel Organics In-situ enviRonmental
Analyzer (MOIRA) instrument, developed in the first cycle of Center funding for mobile monitoring, will be
expanded and optimized for indoor/outdoor VOC monitoring studies. MOIRA is a gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) instrument with high time resolution (e.g., ten minutes). Its capabilities will be expanded
to measure both higher and lower volatility compounds than can be achieved with the current design. These
innovative, high time resolution in situ measurements will be coupled with conventional time-integrated VOC
passive sampling to measure target Superfund-relevant VOCs at homes of some participants in the allied clinical
study. These data will be used to build spatiotemporal models to estimate ambient VOCs at the homes of all
clinical study participants, and to gain new insights into VOC levels and their determinants in the home
microenvironment. In addition to exposure assessment, the two measurement platforms are responsive to
ongoing Superfund program advancements; these innovative developments will expand future capacities to
monitor VOC indoor vapor intrusion, monitor outdoor VOC levels during site remediation, and monitor both
indoors and outdoors during post-remediation surveillance."
10914190,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) have a poor prognosis with a post-relapse median
survival of approximately 30 months and limited therapeutic options, thus presenting a fundamental unmet
medical need. Progress in immunotherapy across a broad range of tumor types provides hope that
immunological approaches may improve outcomes for patients with EOC. Particularly, a type of immunotherapy
called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy retrains the immune system to target cancers by
recognizing specific cancer markers. EOC presents several challenges to effective CAR T cell immunotherapy,
including poor tumor site infiltration, activation, inadequate function and persistence of these T cells within the
harsh peritoneal tumor microenvironment. Additionally, there are a lack of effective CAR T cell targets on the
surface of advanced EOC tumor cells. Our goal is to develop effective therapies against metastatic EOC, with a
specific focus on regional delivery of CAR T cell therapies to treat peritoneal metastasis. TAG72 is highly over-
expressed in EOC and other solid tumors with little or no expression in normal tissues, making it an ideal target
for CAR T cell therapy. Our team at City of Hope has developed and completed laboratory testing of a TAG72-
targeting CAR T cell therapy. Our preclinical data also supports superior anti-tumor activity when TAG72 CAR T
cells are administered regionally by intraperitoneal delivery versus systemically by intravenous delivery, likely
due to direct and immediate antigen CAR T cell access to tumor cells. The hypothesis is that regionally-
administered TAG72-CAR T cells will be safe and mediate anti-tumor effects, which will be assessed in the
following specific aims: 1) Evaluate safety and feasibility of regional intraperitoneal delivery of TAG72-CAR T
cells in patients with advanced EOC in a phase 1 clinical trial; 2) Assess CAR T cell-mediated immune landscape
changes that may indicate therapeutic response or resistance; and 3) investigate pathways of tumor resistance
and CAR T cell-induced tumor evolution. Our program has incorporated an innovative use of pre-conditioning
regimens to our solid tumor CAR T cell therapies, regional routes of CAR T cell administration, and a fully-
optimized TAG72-CAR construct. These features aim to improve the potency and selectivity of targeting TAG72+
tumors while potentially minimizing immune responses that limit persistence and/or function of TAG72-CAR T
cells. This approach is significant in that it will expand our therapeutic portfolio for EOC and other solid tumors."
10914194,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are highly prevalent brain diseases with enormous social and economic
impacts. Failure to understand their causative molecular and cellular mechanisms is largely responsible for the
paucity of available therapies. However, NDDs are highly heritable and the identification of causative single
gene mutations in patients will help define underlying genetic risk factors and molecular abnormalities. We
recently identified patients around the world harboring heterozygous and monogenic deletions of the ANKS1B
gene. Clinical analyses reveal that affected individuals present with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental
phenotypes, including autism, and speech and motor deficits. Our findings formalize a link between ANKS1B
haploinsufficiency and a previously undefined syndrome we term AnkSyd. Because the mechanisms linking
ANSK1B to essential cellular functions dysregulated in AnkSyd are unknown, elucidating ANKS1B function
represents a key opportunity to define molecular mechanisms contributing to NDDs and normal brain function.
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to define the mechanisms underlying AnkSyd and identify
therapeutic targets. ANKS1B encodes for AIDA-1, a brain specific protein that is one of the most abundant
proteins at neuronal synapses. Our lab found that AIDA-1 is specifically enriched at postsynaptic densities
where it controls NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function by regulating the synaptic localization and function of
GluN2B subunits of NMDARs. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that NMDAR dysfunction
contributes to AnkSyd. Toward this purpose, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and neurons
from patients and unaffected family members, as well as a transgenic mouse model that displays behavioral
correlates of patient phenotypes. 
Overall, this proposal seeks to understand the pathophysiology of AnkSyd, a newly identified genetic syndrome
presenting with autism and neurodevelopmental delays. As a monogenic disease with confirmed ANKS1B
haploinsufficiency, studying AnkSyd will allow us to clearly link AIDA-1 dysfunction to cellular and behavioral
outcomes. The successful completion of these experiments will reveal that NMDAR dysfunction contributes to
AnkSyd pathophysiology and that ANKS1B haploinsufficiency disrupts a specific mechanism linking AIDA-1 to
GluN2B. Finally, these experiments will determine the therapeutic potential of rescuing GluN2B function or
other abnormal molecular pathways identified in AnkSyd models."
10914195,"Abstract
Malignant melanoma is an example of primary clinical significance for investigating sex-related
differences in cancer arising in organs with non-reproductive functions. Differences in sex
hormone levels and in downstream pathways are likely to play a key role, which is however still
poorly understood. Our main working hypothesis is that androgen receptor (AR) and associated
proteins converge on control of melanoma development and response to treatment. In recent
work, we have found that genetic and pharmacological suppression of AR activity in a large panel
of melanoma cells reduces self-renewal potential and tumorigenesis, inducing double strand DNA
damage and cytoplasmic leakage, a STING-dependent pro-inflammatory cascade and a gene
expression signature associated with better patients' survival. Based on further preliminary data,
we will test two specific hypotheses: 1) AR signaling plays a key role in melanoma cells at the
intersection between gene transcription and DNA repair / genomic stability with nuclear lamins as
co-determinants. We will probe into the biochemical and functional significance of endogenous
AR-lamin interactions and AR-dependent lamin A/C association with the PPP1 protein
phosphatase, impinging on lamin phosphorylation at critical residues, and with the DDX3X and
DDX3Y RNA helicases, encoded by X- and Y-linked genes and with expression of prognostic
significance for female and male patients, respectively. 2) Targeting AR is of translational
significance for preventing / counteracting resistance of melanomas with BRAFv600 mutations to
BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). In preliminary work, we found striking up-regulation of AR expression in
response to BRAFi, proliferation and tumorigenesis of BRAFi resistant melanoma cells are
suppressed by AR inhibition, AR overexpression is by itself sufficient to confer BRAFi resistance.
In further studies we will assess to what extent suppression of AR expression and activity has an
impact on melanoma cell subpopulations with intrinsic BRAFi resistance and/or BRAFi-induced
epigenetic reprogramming. We will analyze a collection of freshly derived cells from Patient-
Derived Xenografts (PDX) of BRAFi sensitive and resistant melanomas and assess to what extent
the beneficial effects of suppression of AR signalling occur in vivo, restoring one or more aspects
of the BRAFi response of the corresponding PDXs."
10914690,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite years of investigation into its causes and potential biomarkers, the rate of pregnancies ending preterm
in the United States has remained around 10% in the overall population and 15% in Black women. Two thirds of
preterm births occur spontaneously and are not initiated by a medical intervention. As spontaneous preterm birth
is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, and is associated with maternal complications, it both
reflects and drives significant racial disparities in reproductive health. We and others have shown that both
vaginal metabolites and microbes are associated with spontaneous preterm birth, but also that these
associations vary across races. Therefore, in order to identify biomarkers that will enable early diagnosis of
preterm birth and develop strategies for its prevention in diverse populations, we must fully understand how
maternal race interacts with these associations. Understanding the role of race in spontaneous preterm birth will
require identifying the social and environmental variables that explain its impact on microbial and metabolite risk
factors. Previous studies on the influence of race on the associations between vaginal metabolites, microbes,
and preterm birth suffered from small sample sizes, limited clinical data, and a lack of longitudinal data. They
also relied on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which measures only the composition of the microbiome, and does
not account for strain differences or quantify functional genetic elements.
The objective of this proposal is to study the interactions among maternal race, vaginal metabolite levels, vaginal
microbes, and spontaneous preterm birth. I will perform a paired analysis of vaginal metabolites and vaginal
metagenomic sequencing data, which profiles the entire genomic content of the microbiome. The data I will
analyze originates from the nuMoM2b cohort, a large, extensively characterized, and racially-diverse cohort of
pregnant women, in which microbiome samples were collected at multiple timepoints. My central hypothesis is
that maternal race has significant interactions with the associations among vaginal metabolites, vaginal
microbes, and preterm birth. To understand these interactions, I will identify associations between vaginal
metabolites and functional elements of vaginal microbes with spontaneous preterm birth, and compare them
between Black and white women. I will also identify microbiome dynamics using longitudinal data and
mathematical models of microbial interactions and growth rates. I will then identify the social and environmental
factors that explain the influence of race on associations among vaginal microbes, metabolites, and preterm
birth. This project will identify preterm birth risk factors that will be useful in diverse populations, will raise
additional hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms underlying spontaneous preterm birth in both Black and
white women, and will lay a groundwork for future research on preterm birth treatment and prevention."

In the United States, the total number of In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinics has stayed relatively stagnant through
the past decade, and the IVF-cycles per million women remains significantly lower than in other developed
countries. The greatest challenge for widespread use of IVF includes its high cost, driven by the need for complex
and expensively equipped IVF laboratories and highly-trained embryologists. The high cost and accessibility
of IVF clinics is the leading reason why couples are unable to undergo or delay IVF treatment and/or egg
banking. Our company’s goal is to automate various functions within an embryology lab to decrease the cost
and improve the overall accessibility of IVF treatments and fertility preservation. We are aiming to achieve this
by reducing the equipment and personnel requirements so as to pave the way towards de-centralization of IVF.
Towards this goal, our proposed new technology “OvaSafe” will facilitate vitrification of oocytes prior to them
being transferred to central embryology labs for fertilization or long-term storage facilities for preservation.
OvaSafe will complement the ongoing project, OvaReady, which automatically prepares oocytes for vitrification.
OvaSafe will utilize microfluidic devices to load cryoprotectant agents (CPA) rapidly and gradually to
oocytes, and automatically transfer the oocytes into silica capillary carriers prior to them being plunged
into liquid nitrogen to complete the vitrification process. In addition to improving the accessibility by enabling
processing of gametes at satellite clinics, performing gradual CPA loading using microfluidic devices will reduce
the CPA exposure, toxicity, and osmotic stress to oocytes. Automated CPA loading and utilization of a closed
vitrification carrier will eliminate variations between operators and clinics. Although the scope of this proposal is
limited to oocyte vitrification, the technology can also be applicable to embryo vitrification in the future.
In our preliminary studies, we demonstrated that gradual CPA loading using microfluidics and silica capillary
vitrification are both practical methods which can improve vitrification outcomes. We showed that gradual CPA
loading decreases the total CPA exposure to oocytes, and reduces the osmotic stress driven by cell shrinkage
which is a response to standard step-wise CPA loading protocols. We also demonstrated that silica capillaries
can achieve ultra-rapid cooling and warming rates that are comparable to standard open carrier methods, and
the vitrification outcomes with silica capillaries are comparable or superior to standard methods. In the proposed
work, we will build on these innovations and integrate both methods in a simple, reliable, and closed system to
automate the oocyte vitrification process. Through this Fast-Track application, we propose and plan to complete
the following aims in this order: develop a microfluidic CPA loading device; modify CPA loading device for
automated oocyte loading to silica capillaries; have plastic microfluidic devices and customized silica capillaries
manufactured to improve usability; design and build an automated control system; demonstrate success of the
automated workflow with vitrification of mouse and donated human oocytes."
10917400,"Postpartum depression (PPD) affects 1 in 7 mothers in the US with double the rate among
low-income women, causing emotional distress, consequences for infant development and later
child adjustment, disruptions in family relationships, and significant financial burden. The ROSE
Program (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for mothers of newborns) is an evidence-based
preventive intervention administered as a series of 4 in-person group sessions plus one
postpartum booster session. ROSE reduced cases of PPD by half in four clinical trials with low-
income women. However, there are major obstacles to disseminating ROSE broadly to women
at risk for PPD. If women across the nation could easily access ROSE virtually at the time and
place of their choosing, the incidence of PPD could be reduced significantly. Our Phase I project
developed a prototype of the first virtual ROSE session and we found 100% of 38 pregnant
women at risk for PPD who trialed the session rated their experiences as highly favorable,
informative, and helpful. Our current Phase II proposal goal is to finish development of a full
app-based ROSE program (e-ROSE) and evaluate the app’s outcomes to lay the groundwork
for commercialization and broad implementation. We know from previous trials that ROSE has
better outcomes than a control consisting of an educational brochure about PPD. We now
hypothesize e-ROSE and ROSE delivered as usual (ROSE) will result in better depression
outcomes compared to these historical control data. We also hypothesize e-ROSE will result in
a better return on investment (ROI) compared to ROSE and compared to utilization data from a
second control group of women who were not offered ROSE identified through electronic health
records. We will explore if depression outcomes for e-ROSE are non-inferior than for ROSE.
Last, we hypothesize that perceived access and satisfaction with the intervention will serve as
mediators of depression outcomes. Thus we will complete conversion of all five group sessions
to an app-based platform and incorporate additional engagement and support strategies (Aim
1), test its impact on reducing PPD and improving ROI within 3 months post-delivery in a
randomized trial (Aim 2), and determine if improving perceived access and satisfaction is a
pathway for improving depression (Aim 3). At the end of the project, the e-ROSE product will be
ready for Phase III commercialization nationwide allowing easy, low-cost distribution on a
variety of platforms to the end-users as well as position us for further research via
implementation studies."
11052057,"Project Summary
Human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a growing public
health burden and has already surpassed cervical cancer as the most common HPV-related malignancy in the
United States. While HPV+ HNSCC patients have generally good survival, they suffer from life-long
chemoradiotherapy-related morbidities. Current data is insufficient to inform de-intensification of standard
chemoradiotherapy or the development of targeted therapies. My ultimate goal is to understand the
mechanisms by which HPV disrupts DNA damage response (DDR) signaling during HNSCC development,
and to thereby inform the rational design of new targeted therapies. In considering new strategies to effectively
control HPV+ HNSCC, I noted that HPV's oncogenic E6 and E7 proteins abrogate tumor suppressor pathways
and impair DDR signaling to cause genomic instability. The Mendez lab and others have established DDR
kinase WEE1 inhibition via the specific inhibitor AZD1775 (WEE1i) as a new therapeutic strategy in HNSCC,
and that HPV+ HNSCC tumors are hypersensitive. WEE1 inhibition causes S-phase replication stress (RS)
and irreparable DNA damage. Combined with genotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin), WEE1i abrogates the
G2/M checkpoint and causes premature mitosis. I recently showed that HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins sensitize
HNSCC cells to WEE1i monotherapy through activation of a FOXM1-CDK1 circuit that drives mitotic gene
expression and DNA damage. I also showed that elevated basal FOXM1 activity predisposes HPV+ HNSCC to
WEE1i-induced toxicity. Next, I used an RNAi genetic screen to identify RS and DDR targets that synergize
with WEE1i; based on my findings to date, I hypothesize that disruption of RS and DDR pathways by E6/E7
provide exploitable vulnerabilities for a combination targeted therapy that also includes WEE1i. I plan to clarify
the mechanisms by which HPV sensitizes cancer cells to WEE1i-induced replication failure (Aim 1) and
compromises DNA repair pathways upon WEE1 inhibition (Aim 2). I will use murine cancer models to test
novel therapeutic combinations for targeting RS/DDR defects in HPV+ HNSCC and identify the situations in
which they are most effective. In parallel, I will use a targeted quantitative proteomics approach to determine
the E6/E7-specific RS and DDR responses to WEE1i, and multi-panel flow cytometry to determine the
WEE1iassociated changes in the immune landscape of E6/E7-driven tumors in immunocompetent mice. This
award will help me develop my scientific ideas and increase my competency in working with the mouse models
that faithfully recapitulate human cancer. The scientific advances that I make during this training period will be
critical to my ultimate goal of establishing an independent research program that focuses on how HPV drives
HNSCC development and how HPV+ HNSCC might be more safely and effectively treated."

We propose to establish a Hemophilia A Analytical Cohort Research Program (HARP) to support the
development of an Intergenerational Precision Medicine Program for the study of factor VIII (FVIII)
immunogenicity in severe hemophilia A. The first major aim of HARP is to form a new longitudinal
antenatal/neonatal/pediatric severe hemophilia A cohort to study the development of FVIII inhibitors.
The cohort will encompass at least 50 mother-baby pairs, following first genetic carrier mothers and then their
babies with severe hemophilia A over at least the first two years of life. HARP will be responsible for the overall
project coordination, administration, data and biospecimen management, and biostatistics/data analytical
support for the program. The second major aim of HARP is to enable the development of the HARP Shareable
Resource comprised of well annotated data and biological samples collected over the course of the program
accessible through a portal, F8portal.org and a linked biorepository. These resources will be made available to
community researchers. As part of aim 2, protocols will be developed by the HARP Protocols Expert Panel (PEP)
in conjunction with the Consortium of Clinical Centers to support research in four HARP Scientific Emphasis
Areas (SEAs): 1. maternal antenatal research, 2. perinatal research, 3. neonatal/pediatric multi-omics and
immunology research, and 4. hemophilia-event driven neonatal/pediatric multi-omics and immunology research.
The third major aim of HARP is to perform hypothesis-testing research in each of the four Scientific
Emphasis Areas. For the maternal antenatal SEA, we will deeply characterize the mother's expression of FVIII
and the antenatal environment to test our hypothesis that the mother's hemophilia carrier phenotype modulates
inhibitor development by influencing exposure to FVIII tolerizing proteins and future bleeding risk of infant. For
the perinatal SEA, we hypothesize that perinatal exposure to FVIII via expression of F8 gene products are critical
in modulating the FVIII immune response and propose to investigate this via genetic methods in the neonate
and maternal/cord blood. For the neonatal/pediatric -omics and immunology SEA, we hypothesize that
environmental, genetic, and persistent maternal factors promote perturbations in the immune system leading to
a FVIII immune response. We propose to rigorously investigate these factors using genetic, immunologic and -
omics evaluation beginning in neonates and following through early life. Finally, we propose to investigate FVIII
antibody affinity, epitope, and peptide presentation to test our hypothesis that immunologic and/or inflammatory
events occurring around FVIII exposure influence production of FVIII-IgG1 and ultimately inhibitors for the
hemophilia event-driven SEA. Together, this proposal seeks to provide rigorous scientific and clinical data
with biospecimens and expert support for a communal resource to drive innovative investigations of
FVIII immunogenicity."
10916311,"Periodontal Disease (PD) continues to remain a major public health burden in the United States. Manifestation
and progression of PD are multifactorial, and may vary across gender, with/without additional comorbidities, such
as Type-2 Diabetes (T2D), where comorbid subjects are at an elevated risk of compromised oral health. There
is an overall paucity of clinically interpretable and nationally representative cross-sectional summaries of
numerous risk factors (and their complex interactions) in assessing multi-comorbidity aspects (here, PD and
T2D), and precise estimation of associated causal treatments for PD in practice-based settings, factoring in the
interactions of sex/gender influences. Publicly available nationwide survey databases (such as the NHANES),
and large oral health databases (such as the HealthPartners®, HP) are important, but somewhat under-utilized
resources for such evaluations and practical interpretations, mainly due to several unique statistical and
epidemiological complexities, which are often beyond the capabilities of existing standard analytical tools and
software packages. Furthermore, how to prioritize patients for oral clinic visits based on their sex/gender
determinants, and multi-comorbidity risks continues to remain unresolved. In this project, we address these
challenges, and initially propose a stochastically-principled, nationally meaningful, summary risk index (Aim 1)
representing cross-sectional PD association from about 11,700 adult dentate subjects, who are part of the
NHANES 2009-2014 study, for the 4 target groups: (a) Males with T2D, (b) Males without T2D, (c) Females with
T2D, and (d) Females, without T2D. We then refine and validate this derived index, and propose a time-varying
PD index (Aim 2) for the four target subgroups, accommodating causality of periodontal treatment effects, via
application to the rich, longitudinal, observational HP database of about 25,000 subjects in a practice-based
setting, with further model fitting and cross-validation using the Kaiser Permanente Northwest database of about
1,17,000 subjects with similar characteristics. Next, we utilize the time-varying index to construct an optimal
policy (Aim 3) for prioritizing high-risk patients for quicker clinic visits. Finally, we produce a free, interactive,
web-application tool (Aim 4) via R Shiny, for estimation and computation of the personalized index and recall
decisions for any future patient. Our statistically principled, comprehensive, unique index for PD integrating
electronic medical records from two large HMOs will be the first of its kind to generate new knowledge in regards
to assessing sex/gender influences. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is readily generalizable to other
comorbidities across gender choices, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver disease, etc. In the longer
term, pending rigorous model validation, the derived index has the potential to be integrated into popular
chairside software, such as Patterson’s EagleSoft®, thereby facilitating efficient bench to bedside translation."

Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are the leading cause of death among teens in the United States. Teen drivers who
have committed a traffic violation are at an even higher risk of MVC-related injuries and deaths compared to their
counterparts without a traffic violation. While parent engagement interventions are an effective strategy to improve
driving safety among teens of all risk profiles, these interventions have not been translated and tested among high-
risk teen drivers such as those with a traffic violation. Furthermore, to date, no studies have examined the cost-
effectiveness of interventions that promote safe teen driving practices. This proposed study addresses princi-
pal gaps in teen driving research by translating an evidence-based universal intervention to a high-risk, yet un-
derstudied, population of teen drivers with a traffic violation. This study will test, in a hybrid randomized controlled
trial (RCT), the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the new intervention, Steering Teens Safe+
(STS+) that integrates in-vehicle driving feedback technology with parent communication training. Our long-
term goal is to inform juvenile traffic courts’ adoption and implementation of evidence-based, cost-effective in-
terventions into high-risk driving populations, and reduce MVCs and MVC-related injuries and deaths. Our
three specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine if both intervention groups are superior to and more cost-effective than
the control group on the outcomes of parent-teen communication, teens’ risky driving behaviors, traffic violation re-
cidivism, and MVCs. Aim 2: Examine differences in intervention outcomes and cost-effectiveness by mode of deliv-
ery (expert- vs. peer-delivered intervention). Aim 3: Identify the contextual factors associated with adoption and im-
plementation of the intervention. We will recruit 290 parent-teen dyads from rural and urban juvenile traffic courts in
Ohio following their mandatory court hearing. Each dyad will be comprised of a teen driver (ages 16 to 17) who has
committed a moving violation and a parent/legal guardian. Enrolled dyads will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study
groups: 1) Expert-delivered intervention, 2) Peer-delivered intervention, and 3) Control. Our central hypothesis
is that the peer-delivered intervention is non-inferior (i.e., not much worse) to and more cost-effective than the ex-
pert-delivered intervention and that both intervention groups are superior to the control. This project is significant
because it represents a substantial step forward in national research focused on teen drivers, an area in which
implementation research has been underrepresented. This study is innovative because it will recruit high-risk teen
drivers through a unique partnership with rural and urban traffic courts, utilize cutting-edge in-vehicle driving feed-
back technology, and test the mode of intervention delivery. The findings will facilitate the widespread adoption,
implementation, and dissemination of STS+ in rural and urban settings and will have an impact on juvenile traf-
fic courts’ practices and policies aimed to improve teen driving safety by reducing MVCs and MVC-related injuries
and deaths."

pandemic, a priority of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for the INCLUDE project.
The underlying immunologic, anatomic, and physiologic abnormalities of DS make individuals with DS
susceptible to respiratory viral infections and less responsive to immunizations. During the pandemic, studies
have shown that individuals with DS are at increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections and more severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, the implementation of
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hand washing, social distancing, and face masking has
resulted a dramatic global reduction in the incidence of common respiratory virus infections during the
pandemic. Respiratory burden resulting from these viruses in individuals with DS might be reduced. The
overarching objectives of the study are to determine the burden of respiratory morbidity in individuals
with DS during the pandemic time. Building upon the parent study of a population-based birth cohort of
3,051 children with DS who were born in 1995-2019 and enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid Program and
Department of Defense Military Healthcare System, we propose to 1) expand the cohort to include individuals
with DS who were born during the pandemic (born 2020-2023, estimated N=705) and 2) extend the follow-up
period of the current subjects (born 1995-2019) to 2023 to study all-cause respiratory morbidity during the
pandemic time. We will determine the rates and quantify the severity of COVID-19 related and unrelated
respiratory healthcare encounters. Respiratory morbidity, including healthcare encounters for COVID-19,
pneumonia, otitis media, croup, wheezing, asthma, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, respiratory failure, tympanostomy
tube, and other respiratory related morbidity, will be examined.
Public Health Impact. Results of the study will provide a better understanding of the overall prevalence and
burden of COVID-19 related and unrelated respiratory morbidity, and provide important information to inform
the usage of subsequent vaccines, protection products, and therapeutic strategies in individuals with DS, an
important goal of the INCLUDE project and part of our research team’s long-term interest."

The long-term objective of this program of research is to increase access to hearing health care for underserved
older adults. The aims of this proposal focus on the hearing and communication needs of an older bilingual Latinx
population. Aim 1 will focus on speech understanding in noisy backgrounds. We will investigate the impacts of
age, hearing, cognitive processing, and bilingual language history on speech-in-noise performance. This aim
includes lab-based and virtual test protocols that will measure speech understanding, nonspeech auditory
processing, and nonverbal cognitive (i.e., executive function) processing skills. The results of these studies will
improve our theoretical understanding of speech perception abilities for all older adults, while specifically
increasing the knowledge base related to Spanish/English bilingual older adults. The investigations undertaken
in Aim 2 will focus on assessing and defining the challenges associated with age, hearing loss, and bilingualism
in every day communication. A mixed methods approach will be undertaken in Aim 2. One study will rely on
ecological momentary assessment (EMA)—brief surveys sent via mobile device periodically throughout the
day—to quantify the demand for use of both languages in a Latinx community of older adults within the broader
context of a majority English-speaking environment. In addition, interviews with the EMA participants will add
context to the survey questions related to communication and effort experienced in daily encounters. Finally,
focus groups will explore issues related to aging and hearing loss, and their impact on social engagement for
older bilingual Latinx adults. Importantly, we will seek to determine what the hearing and communication priorities
are for this growing and underserved population of older adults. The knowledge generated regarding speech
understanding and communication needs and priorities will be used in future grant applications to develop
community-integrated service models that will better serve older adults."

Globally, dramatic changes in our environments are leading to increases in non-communicable diseases that are
determined by the complex interplay between our genetics and environment. Knowing why and how some
individuals are more sensitive than others to environmental perturbations remains a major gap in our
understanding of traits for which the genetic effects are environmentally dependent. To address this gap, we
have partnered with a subsistence-level community in northwest Kenya, the Turkana, who very recently initiated
a transition from a traditional lifestyle to an urban one and are in parallel showing increases in cardiometabolic
disorders. I propose to study molecular responses to this drastic lifestyle change in the context of inflammatory
mechanisms that confer increased risk for metabolic diseases. First, I will identify disruptions in coordinated
biological processes following the shift toward a Western lifestyle, through the detection of metabolic gene
network disturbances in PBMCs. Next I will identify genomic regulatory (ATAC-seq) and transcriptional (RNA-
seq) responses to in vitro pro-inflammatory stimulation in monocytes, wherein differential responses across the
lifestyle gradient in the Turkana will inform how chronic obesogenic signaling (in an urban environment) alters
acute inflammatory processes that typically occur in response to nutritional status. I will then identify the genetic
contribution to variation in monocyte pro-inflammatory responses and ask to what degree these genetic effects
are modulated by an individual’s lifestyle (i.e. genotype-by-environment interaction). Finally, I will ask to what
degree these loci explain inter-individual differences in health-related biomarkers. Because of the Turkana’s
unique history and current migration patterns, they are uniquely poised to study the health impact of rapid
environmental shift, as well as the degree to which genotype predisposes individuals toward vulnerability or
resilience in the face of environmental challenges (i.e. a western lifestyle). Addressing these important questions
in a largely understudied population of African ancestry has important implications toward global health and
precision medicine in African-Americans. Taken together, these Aims align with the NIH objectives, as they
involve understanding individual susceptibility to disease and risk across populations; and understanding the
pathobiology of the Western environment on our cardiometabolic health. My fellowship training plan will focus
on improving my quantitative skills, as I aim to build a research program focused on understanding the
contribution of genotype-by-environment interactions to cardiometabolic risk. This development will be enabled
by the mentorship from Dr. Julien Ayroles, who is an expert in systems and quantitative genetics and recently
initiated the Turkana Health and Genomics project at the core of this application. My interactions with the Ayroles
group and collaborations with the diverse faculty at the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at
Princeton will support the training and academic network necessary to succeed in my goal of becoming an
independent investigator."
10908428,"ABSTRACT
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that predominantly affects individuals of African
descent. The physiologic hallmarks of SCD include chronic red blood cell hemolysis, oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular
damage and end-organ damage. These physiologic sequelae lead to unpredictable vaso occlusive complications,
such as pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS). Human breastmilk contains antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and
immune-modulating properties proven to be protective against chronic inflammatory conditions, such as
asthma, obesity and cardiovascular disease. The lasting impacts of human breastmilk have been
demonstrated in adolescent and adult studies, wherein individuals that were breastfed as infants had lower
levels of biological markers of inflammation in their bloodstream. Interestingly, breastmilk has even been
demonstrated to be protective against the erosion of telomeres – which are the protective caps of DNA and
established markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. The American Academy of Pediatrics and World
Health Organization recommend exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first 6 months of life, followed by 1 to 2
years of breastfeeding with nutritious supplementation. However, despite these recommendations and the well-
established protective benefits of EBF, the gap between Healthy People 2020 breastfeeding goals and current
rates of EBF is widest amongst African American women compared to all other racial and ethnic groups.
Furthermore, the protective effects of EBF have never been explored in SCD. Several studies have noted a
lack of breastfeeding role models and support networks as barriers to EBF among African American women.
One community-based organization located in Birmingham (Alabama) — the Chocolate Milk Mommies —,
specifically addresses these barriers through online and in-person education and support groups, certified
lactation consultant services, free breast pump rentals for low-income mothers and a home visitation and peer-
mentoring program. Chocolate Milk Mommies specifically targets African American mothers, given the lower rates
of breastfeeding in this population. This group achieved a 6-month EBF rate of 83% in 2019, far exceeding state
and national trends. Given the pervasive oxidative stress and inflammation in SCD, and the consequent risk
for pain and poor lung health, it is essential to test the protective benefits of EBF and establish effective EBF-
promoting interventions among this high risk population. The aims for this project are to: 1) test the association
between EBF exposure and SCD complications, 2) test the association between EBF exposures and biological
markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and 3) pilot the feasibility to recruit and retain 20 mothers of
children with SCD to a community-based EBF program (the Chocolate Milk Mommies) for ≥6 months, which
will inform a future larger randomized controlled trial. The long-term goal for this research is to establish the
protective benefits of breastfeeding in SCD and improve overall health outcomes through the promotion of EBF."
10906544,"This proposal requests sponsorship for the 14th International Kawasaki Disease Symposium (IKDS), which will
be held August 26-29, 2024, in Montreal, Canada. Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the most common cause of
acquired cardiovascular disease in childhood in the United States, and if not diagnosed and treated in a timely
fashion can lead to giant coronary aneurysms, myocardial infarction and even death. IKDS has been held
every 3 years since 1984 with the goal of bringing together clinicians caring for KD patients, scientists trying to
unravel this mysterious illness, and families affected with KD. With the pandemic, we were unable to hold an
in-person meeting for the 13th IKDS in 2021, which limited our ability to interact and collaborate on this global
disease. With nearly 6 years since the last in-person, we have an incredible opportunity to bring together KD
researchers, clinicians and families to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of KD. IKDS will once again
disseminate the latest advances in KD research and clinical care, which in accordance with the NIH mission
will “enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability” of children with KD. Given that this is a
cardiovascular illness that affects children that likely have an infectious cause, and IKDS’ mission to turn
research observations into health solutions, it is fitting for NHLBI to be the primary institute supporting IKDS,
and NICHD, NIAID and NCATS as secondary institutes. The objectives of this application are to provide travel
support to 14 trainees (medical students/residents, graduate students and early stage investigators) with top
abstracts to present their work at the 14th IKDS and actively engage with senior investigators, to provide
funding for publication of these abstracts and meeting proceedings in a special edition of the Canadian Journal
of Cardiology, and to fund two world-renowned cardiovascular immunology speakers to advance this field for
KD. The Specific Aims of the 14th IKDS to achieve this objective are (1) Provide a forum to bring together basic
and clinical researchers, clinicians, epidemiologists, educators, public health officials and KD families to
discuss cutting-edge KD research as well as barriers to care in order to identify research needs and facilitate
cross-disciplinary collaborations to address them; (2) Provide an educational forum for trainees and early stage
investigators to interact with senior investigators, with an understanding that there is a critical need to cultivate
knowledgeable and enthusiastic new investigators; and (3) Recruit trainees and senior faculty from diverse
scientific, racial and ethnic backgrounds, focusing on underrepresented groups, to attend the 14th IKDS.
With a global collaborative spirit, IKDS will advance the science of KD and improve the lives of children with
KD worldwide."

10922851,"Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a breast cancer screening methodology in which radiologists
search for cancer in 3D volumes of virtual slices through the breast. DBT performs better than classic,
2D mammography but it takes more time. Our goal is to compare different methods that could reduce
the time required while maintaining or improving performance. Beyond the specific goal of improving
DBT, we will uncover general principles of attention and perception that can be applied whenever the
volume of images threatens to overwhelm the ability of observers to consume those images. We are
particularly interested in conditions of “low target prevalence” (low percentage of positive cases). In
tasks like breast cancer screening, with many images and very few clinically significant targets,
interventions that are effective when tested at high prevalence in the lab may fail in the field when
prevalence is much lower. There are three projects:
Project 1: Self-Triage by 2D Full-field digital mammography or synthetic images: In screening for
breast cancer, there will be some cases that a reader could safely declare ‘normal’ on the basis of the
2D image, alone. Is it reasonable to develop a protocol where some DBT images would be acquired
but would not be examined? This “self-triage” would require a very conservative triage criterion in order
to avoid triage of any positive cases, but if proven to be safe, self-triage could save significant time and
might reduce false negative errors.
Project 2: DBT as “hybrid search”: Breast cancer screening involves search for more than one type
of target (masses and calcifications, at minimum). Research shows instances where such ‘hybrid’
search for multiple targets leads to elevated errors. We will test the hypothesis that readers are more
efficient and/or more accurate if they perform separate searches for each target type. We will measure
eye movements to compare search for each target type alone to search for both types together.
Experiments with non-experts will investigate basic principles of search in 3D volumes of image data.
Project 3: AI Targeted ‘drilling’: Eye tracking has identified two modes of search in 3D stacks of
images: “drilling”, where readers move rapidly through depth (Z) while the eyes stay relatively stable in
the XY plane, and “scanning”, where readers search widely in XY while moving slowly in Z. We will use
eye tracking to evaluate a CAD system developed by iCAD that marks specific locations in the 2D XY
image and invites readers to drill in these specific areas. Does that improve CAD performance?
Summary: This program of research will produce recommendations for increasing the efficiency of
breast cancer screening. Moreover, each study will produce basic science that will be generalizable to
other settings and will deepen our understanding of visual search through 3D volumes of image data."
10922857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the current project is to understand how emotional thoughts can be removed from one's
mind. Most psychiatric disorders are characterized by an inability to remove negative, intrusive, and maladaptive
thoughts from mind. Previously examining whether an individual has purged a thought from mind has relied
mainly on self-report measures (e.g., “Yes, I stopped thinking about the car crash”). In the proposed research,
the research team will use a combination of brain imaging approaches with machine learning techniques drawn
from computer science to provide an objective neural marker of whether indeed a thought has been removed
from mind. This approach builds on proven success with this technique pioneered by the research team. This
prior work focused on the removal of (emotionally neutral) information from mind and demonstrated that
suppressing a specific thought and clearing one's mind of all thought rely on different neural mechanisms.
Moreover, the prior findings indicated that these mental operations differentially affect one's ability to take in
new information after the old information has been removed. The focus of the proposed project will be to
examine how emotional information is removed from current thought. The project will ask three main questions.
First, it will examine whether the emotional valence of information affects the engagement and effectiveness of
neural systems involved in removing information from mind. A series of parallel studies, one involving
neuroimaging and the other examining people's behavior, are designed to examine whether these removal
operations are affected by a) the emotional valence (positive, negative) of the information to be removed, b) the
emotional valence of the information that should now be brought to mind and c) the match (e.g., positive,
positive) or mismatch (positive, negative) between the valence of the information being removed and that which
replaces it. Expectations are that negative information will be harder to remove and easier to be brought into
current thought than positive information. Second, the project will examine whether the effectiveness of these
removal operations varies across individuals. It will assess the degree to which individuals report that they have
difficulty controlling their thoughts, the degree to which they have symptoms related to depression and anxiety,
and their ability to hold and manipulate information in working memory. Expectations are that individuals who
report difficulty in controlling their thoughts will have difficulty in removing information from mind, and that
people with higher levels of depression will have specific difficulties in removing negative thoughts. Third, the
project will examine whether individuals can be trained, using real-time feedback about brain function during
neuroimaging, to effectively remove thoughts from mind by providing them with a sense of what it feels like to
successfully remove a thought. The results of the proposed project will have important implications both for
understanding the recurrent and intrusive thoughts that characterize psychopathology and for providing
insights on how they might be reduced."
10917693,"ABSTRACT
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is gradually becoming an essential alternative to surgical aortic
valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at high or prohibitive surgical risk. The
published PARTNER 3 and EVOLUT LOW-RISK trials have recently demonstrated that TAVR can be considered
in low-risk patients. However, the long-term durability of transcatheter prosthetic valves has become a major
concern nowadays, especially for young patients with greater life expectancy. Although increased efficacy and
safety of the current leading TAVR valves (e.g., Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards Sapien) have been reported
lately, tissue valve dysfunction and failure remain the limiting factors for the long-term outcome of TAVR.
Furthermore, the application of those TAVR valves is limited to certain patients due to the use of the relatively
large delivery system (typically 14-16 Fr. Size). There is a substantial clinical desire for a lower-profile delivery
system since it accommodates a greater population of patients with peripheral artery disease or small arteries
and reduces the risk of vascular complications following transfemoral TAVR. It is well known that calcification
plays a major role in the failure of bioprostheses and other tissue heart valve substitutes. Mechanical stress
imposed on the leaflets contributes to the growth of calcium crystals and collagen fibers’ disruption, which
induces thrombosis, calcification, and early valve failure. Therefore, a superior biomaterial with appropriate
mechanical (low stress) and structural (thickness) properties may provide a solution for prolongation of
transcatheter valve durability and size reduction of delivery system. Our group has previously verified that swine
and bovine pulmonary visceral pleura (PVP) are highly elastic and much thinner (~1/3 of the thickness) than
bovine pericardial tissue typically used for the current TAVR valves. The larger compliance and smaller thickness
of PVP make it possible to become a more durable valve leaflet and to be delivered with a lower profile delivery
system (<14 Fr.). Thus, we propose PVP as a potential disruptive biomaterial for constructing bioprosthetic heart
valves. The objective of the SBIR Phase I proposal is to determine the feasibility of the bovine PVP to serve as
the leaflets of TAVR in chronic animals. To accomplish this goal, we set the following two Specific Aims: 1) To
create a transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) from PVP into a smaller delivery profile (12 Fr.), and 2) To assess
chronic in vivo performance of PVP TAVR in juvenile sheep for up to 24 weeks. We have calculated and
tested that bovine PVP leaflets with thickness ≤ 0.1 mm can be crimped in a 12 Fr. catheter without causing
tissue damage. The juvenile sheep model is the gold standard animal model for prosthetic valve testing.
Completion of this study may provide a new type of bioprosthetic material for transcatheter heart valves that
have potential to enhance the valve durability and improve TAVR outcomes. The success of this program would
also deliver significant benefits to patients ranging from adolescents to the elderly with the limited size of the
access arteries."

Children of Puerto Rican (PR) descent have higher rates of asthma prevalence and morbidity than children
from any other ethnic group. Children residing on the Island of PR have even higher asthma prevalence than
Mainland PR children. We propose to implement and evaluate the Puerto Rico-Asthma Integrated
Response Program (PR-AIR) to address pediatric asthma disparities in San Juan, PR, an area of high
asthma burden. PR-AIR integrates evidence-based interventions in home and school settings, and enhances
communication between families, schools, and health care providers. During Phase 1, we will convene a
community collaborative of stakeholders that will provide input throughout the project, and use in-depth
interviews to identify community needs, barriers, and facilitators to enable PR-AIR implementation. We will
identify which characteristics of our existing evidence-based virtual and in-person interventions in home and
school settings require fidelity-consistent modifications and use stakeholder input and matching of barriers to
implementation strategy selection to identify methods to enhance PR-AIR uptake. During Phase 2, we will use
a hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation design, evaluating low-intensity (virtual) and high-intensity
(in-person) methods of implementation of PR-AIR. We will provide PR-AIR sequentially to 12 communities
identified with high asthma burden through geospatial mapping using a cluster randomized, stepped wedge
trial design, delivering PR-AIR to 400 children with asthma ages 2-12. We will use a mixed-methods approach
to assess the impact of our implementation strategies on PR-AIR reach, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance, and evaluate effectiveness of PR-AIR on individual-level (asthma control, quality of life) and
community-level (health care utilization, school absences) outcomes. PR-AIR builds on a 20-year
collaboration between our research teams in RI and PR, with an investment in advancing knowledge of
multi-level factors affecting pediatric asthma disparities and reducing morbidity in children through evidence-
based, sustainable interventions."
10922699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This year alone, over 600,000 people in the U.S. will die from cancer, with each patient losing an average
of 15.6 years of life. However, upwards of 25% of these deaths could likely be avoided if these cancers
were detected at earlier stages. One particularly attractive approach for cancer diagnostics is the use of
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from so-called “liquid-biopsies” of patient-derived serum/plasma as
these samples are often enriched in genetic material from tissues, including tumors, located throughout
the body. Nonetheless, tumor specific alterations, such as mutations and aberrant DNA methylation, are
typically only present at extraordinarily low copy numbers (< 10 copies/ml) and fractional concentrations
(< 0.1%) within a large background of healthy-tissue DNA. This issue in particular has proven problematic
for current technologies and has thus far precluded development of a cfDNA diagnostic method that is
simple, low-cost and, most importantly, able to detect cancer at stages sufficiently early to improve patient
outcomes.
In the present project, we aim to develop REM-DREAMing: a low-cost, highly-multiplexed digital
methylation analysis platform that provides highly-sensitive and parallelized assessment of cfDNA
methylation patterns to enable detection of rare tumor DNA, even from early-stage cancers. At the core
of the REM-DREAMing platform is a unique, locus-specific DNA methylation assay, called DREAMing
(Discrimination of Rare EpiAlleles by Melt), that has been successfully developed by our lab to provide
detection and absolute quantification of cancer-specific DNA methylation even at extremely low fractions
(<< 0.1%). Recently, we successfully incorporated the DREAMing assay into a massively-parallel digital
microfluidic array to enable detection of a single copy of aberrantly-methylated DNA in a background of
2 million unmethylated alleles. Here, we propose to dramatically enhance the microfluidic DREAMing
approach by significantly expanding its digitization power and incorporating novel, methylation-agnostic
probes with a unique ratiometric fluorescence multiplexing scheme to achieve simultaneous digital
assessment of a panel of 50 “cancer-detecting” and “cancer-identifying” methylation biomarkers, enabling
liquid-biopsy-based detection and identification of early-stage cancers at a cost of only a few dollars per
sample. To achieve this goal, we plan to accomplish the following aims: (1) Develop dual, 27-plex
DREAMing assay panels targeting a panel of 50 pan-cancer-detecting and cancer-identifying methylation
biomarkers. (2) Design, fabricate and validate a dual 400k-well, 4-color fluorescence-decoding dHRM
platform to perform parallelized REM-DREAMing for simultaneous detection and identification of 50
methylation biomarkers. and (3) Assess and benchmark the ability of the REM-DREAMing platform to
detect and identify six different cancer types from liquid biopsies."

Racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension (HTN) prevalence and control are well-documented and persist
despite targeted initiatives aimed at their reduction. The use of Community Health Workers (CHWs) has been
endorsed as a best practice to reduce HTN disparities among members of vulnerable communities. Despite the
strength of the evidence linking exposure to CHW-delivered interventions with improved HTN-related outcomes
among vulnerable populations, the sub-optimal uptake of CHW interventions across healthcare systems at large,
and barriers to CHWs’ full integration in healthcare teams in particular, may threaten efforts to utilize them in
support of patients whose psychosocial and socioeconomic circumstances require CHWs’ qualities and skillsets.
Dr. Chidinma A. Ibe is a social behavioral scientist and an Assistant Professor of General Internal Medicine at
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She seeks to support the translation and diffusion of this
innovative, effective workforce into routine care by conducting a theory-driven, systematic appraisal of the factors
contributing CHWs’ integration into care teams. She is applying for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award
in order to acquire the skills, experience, and pilot data necessary to lay the foundation for an R01 that will apply
the lessons learned in the K01 research and training period to develop interventions that optimize CHW uptake
across diverse healthcare systems. Her proposed study will examine contextual barriers to the diffusion of a
CHW intervention that formed the crux of a stepped collaborative care intervention. She will leverage the RICH
LIFE (Reducing Inequities in Care of Hypertension: Lifestyle Improvements for Everyone) Project, a pragmatic,
cluster randomized trial aimed at reducing disparities in HTN control featuring the use of CHWs embedded in
collaborative care teams, to: 1) illuminate the complement of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural factors
associated with the CHWs’ integration into care teams; 2) develop a theoretically-rooted measure of CHW care
team integration; 3) explore the extent to which CHWs’ integration into healthcare teams is related to patients’
cardiovascular, behavioral, care management, and process of care outcomes; and 4) use human-centered
design methods to co-develop, in partnership with key stakeholders, an organizational change intervention to
promote CHWs’ integration into care teams. Her career development plan is characterized by a blend of didactic
and experiential training in implementation science, qualitative and mixed methods, and advanced statistical
strategies, including psychometric testing. This proposed research, in combination with an exceptional mentoring
team (Primary Mentor: Dr. Lisa A. Cooper; Co-Mentor, Dr. Jill Marsteller), coursework, and participation in
relevant working groups, professional development programs, and scientific meetings, will position Dr. Ibe to
achieve her goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in the application of implementation
science theories and models to strengthen the development, implementation, and translation of CHW
interventions in healthcare settings."
10922713,"Postoperative recovery in humans varies over a large range and the mechanisms involved are poorly
understood. Peripheral monocytes and brain microglia adopt activation states that can be detrimental to
inflammation resolution pathways involved in postoperative comorbidities like pain and delirium that impact
recovery. The range of activation states correlates to the range of postoperative recovery possibilities observed
in both clinical and experimental settings. This potentially explains the inability of researchers and clinicians to
adequately predetermine a patient’s pain or delirium outcome after surgery, despite extensive basic and
translational studies. The overarching focus of my research program is to identify neuroimmune
mechanisms that contribute to variations in postoperative recovery, such as, pain, cognition, and
depression, accounting for age and sex. Our approach will combine innovative technologies and
relevant pre-clinical experimental models to investigate monocyte/microglia involvement in
postoperative recovery with a focus on pain and delirium. In the past 5 years, we have begun to elucidate
how age and sex influences neuroinflammatory processes involved in pain and cognitive deficits to inflammatory
stimuli, a condition like surgery. We and others have determined that changes in pain and cognitive states in age
is related to “priming” of the immune system and not “current” conditions. Building from our current work, over
the next five years we propose to: 1) Build a clinically relevant postoperative assessment system to evaluate
recovery phases in the context of pain and delirium in rodents. Initial experiments to assess weight loss, body
temperature, and ambulatory movement in male and female young and advanced age groups will set an
important premise. 2) Determine how age and sex influence monocytes (pain) and microglia (delirium) to
modulate neuronal processing is an imperative step toward therapeutic development. We will apply the genomics
method of “translating ribosome affinity purification”, (TRAP) to peripheral monocytes and brain microglia. A
major strength of TRAP is the ability to identify a cell-specific “functional transcriptome”. This approach utilizes
transgenic mice and captures actively translating mRNAs located on ribosomes during protein synthesis. This
allows for quantification of translated RNAs using sequencing techniques. An important point of innovation and
impact for our proposed work is that the identity of functional mRNAs in immune cells in aging, sex, and surgery
will be revealed. Of most interest will be regulation of inflammatory cytokines known to promote pain and/or
delirium after surgery. The work proposed is highly innovative because it integrates advanced methods to resolve
our understanding of postoperative pain and delirium, to eventually move these molecular insights toward new
therapeutic strategies, which aligns with the growing emphasis on human molecular neuroscience in my home
department and research center. Our vision is to integrate behavioral and quantitative, cell-type specific
transcriptomics to create intuitive descriptions of the diverse recovery outcomes observed postoperatively."

Kaiser as an independent physician-scientist focused on the neural mechanisms of pain from light in
migraine and related disorders. He is currently a clinical fellow in headache medicine but will return to
the University of Pennsylvania as an Instructor in the Department of Neurology. The career
development plan builds upon his prior expertise in rodent behavior while refining essential scientific
skills and teaching new technical skills to prepare him for an independent, cutting-edge career in
neuroscience. This will be accomplished by gaining hands-on technical experience using tailored light
stimuli in rodents, applying mouse genetics to study neurologic disorders, and performing
immunohistochemistry to dissect neural circuits. This will be complimented by formal didactics in mouse
genetics, ethics, biostatistics, and grant writing. These efforts will be supported by three mentors
including Dr. Frances Jensen, a renowned physician-scientist in neural plasticity and network
hyperexcitability, Dr. Geoffrey Aguirre, a physician scientist with expertise in visual perception, and Dr.
Wenqin Luo, a neuroscientist with expertise in somatosensation. Dr. Kaiser will also work with Dr. Maria
Geffen, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania that will act a consultant on optogenetic
techniques. The PI will also greatly benefit from the unparalleled resources and faculty at the University
of Pennsylvania and headache experts at the affiliated Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
The objective of this project is to examine the pathologic interaction of the visual and trigeminal sensory
systems. Photophobia is a canonical and debilitating feature of migraine, which is a disabling
neurologic disorder. Bright light perception involves the cones, which project to the classical retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs), and the melanopsin-containing, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs).
Recent human studies by Drs. Kaiser and Aguirre demonstrate that both melanopsin and cone
stimulation in isolation and in combination can trigger visual discomfort in individuals with migraine. Dr.
Kaiser's central hypothesis is that ipRCG signals potentiate trigeminal activation leading to the aversive
perception of light in migraine. To investigate these interactions, the PI proposes to use a mouse model
of migraine in which a neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), induces light aversion.
Using tailored light stimuli to isolate cone and melanopsin activity, the PI will test their relative
contribution to CGRP-induced light aversion. To establish how trigeminal and retinal signals interact in
a migraine-like state, Dr. Kaiser will examine c-fos activation as a marker of neuronal activity in the
trigeminal and retinal pathways following CGRP and light stimulation as well as determine if primary
trigeminal afferents are required for CGRP-induced light aversion."
10922766,"Summary/Abstract
 Infection with high-risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) is a necessary, key event in cervical
carcinoma. A major advance in understanding cervical cancer was the recognition that HPV DNA is integrated
into the human genome in almost all advanced cervical tumors. Human genome integration of HPV DNA 1)
stably associates the viral oncogenes with a host cell, 2) potentially drives expression of host oncogenes that
flank the sites of HPV DNA insertions, and 3) also causes human genome rearrangements. HPV integration is
thought to occur randomly in the human genome, but integrated HPV DNA in tumors is often inserted at one of
dozens of common genes in independent tumors, which suggests a clonal proliferation and survival advantage
of cells containing insertions at these positions. During the initial phase of my research laboratory training, I
developed an extensive, nascent research program to 1) detect and map HPV-human DNA junctions at single
nucleotide resolution (hybridization capture + next generation sequencing, HC+NGS), 2) thoroughly
characterize integrated viral DNA structure, and 3) describe the transcriptomic landscape in both cervical
dysplasia and carcinoma clinical samples. I also applied the HC+NGS assay to a recently developed cell
culture model where HPV circular DNA episomes replicate in early passage, human primary keratinocytes. I
found that HPV DNA integration occurs efficiently in this model, thus providing a potent system to study HPV
DNA integration and its functional consequences. To my knowledge, this is the first system for performing this
type of study. I detected HPV integrated into multiple sites in the human genome, some of which were detected
multiple times indicating clonal expansion of cells containing them. I hypothesize that HPV DNA integration is a
key molecular event that promotes clonal expansion of cells, and promotes the development of dysplasia and
invasive cervical carcinoma. In this application, I seek to develop my laboratory skills by generating and using
new tools to study the spatio-temporal consequences of HPV integration on clonal expansion in patient
derived, progressive cervical dysplasia lesions using multi-color, interphase DNA FISH assays (Aim 1); assess
tumorigenic properties of cultured keratinocytes (Aim 2) and finally to test the role of transcriptional activation
of flanking human genes in the expanded clonal populations (AIM 3). I will utilize a novel barcoding system
based on CRISPR activation of GFP in clones of interest combined with a custom recombinant HPV quasivirus
approach to lineage trace expanded HPV DNA integrated clones. I will carry out the proposed research over a
5 year period as part of a comprehensive K08 Career Development Award. Along with my co-mentors, Dr.
Cristina Montagna and Dr. Jack Lenz, we have developed a training plan focusing on laboratory science and
methodology to achieve my career goal of becoming a fully independent and funded clinician scientist."
10923551,"Granulomas are complex immunologic structures formed in tissues in response to infection. The general function of a granuloma has been elusive because many infections that stimulate granuloma responses do not resolve. Often, granulomas are described as immunologic responses that wall off an infectious agent that cannot be cleared by the immune system. Basic understandings of the fundamentals of a granuloma have been elusive because mouse models where granulomas form are rare or complicated. We have discovered a novel bacterial infection model where the murine immune system forms a granuloma. When mice are infected by Chromobacterium violaceum, the immunologic response fails to clear the bacterium from the liver within the first several days. Then a granuloma forms around the infected lesion, and this complex immunologic response successfully sterilizes the infection and returns the organ to homeostasis typically within 7-14 days post infection. Therefore, we have discovered a novel infectious model where basic granuloma biology can be elucidated. C. violaceum first infects hepatocytes and perhaps Kupffer cells in the liver. This rapidly stimulates a neutrophil swarm within the first day post infection. However, the neutrophil swarm fails to eradicate the infection, and the neutrophils themselves appear to become replicative intracellular niches for the bacterium. Three days post infection the neutrophil swarm dies and forms a central necrotic core of the lesion. Macrophages begin to appear at the periphery of the lesion at 3 days post infection and form a thick macrophage zone that surrounds the necrotic core by day 5-7. Thereafter, the bacteria are killed through the action of inducible nitric oxide synthase, the granuloma is sterilized, and shrinks over the next week. Granuloma burdens are sterilized between 7-21 days post infection. This all occurs in the absence of T cells or other adaptive immune cells. In this grant, we use this novel granuloma model to explore the importance of pyroptotic cell death in the granuloma."

West Nile virus is a pathogen of global concern. Since its introduction to the US in 1999, it has caused thousands
of deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations. West Nile virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of
infected mosquitos; the virus mediates a febrile illness and can progress to invasive infection of the central
nervous system causing severe encephalopathy. WNV neuroinvasive disease also causes cognitive and motor
sequelae that can last for months or years after the virus is cleared. In order to successfully treat these
symptoms, gaining a clearer understanding of the immune response to WNV and the factors that determine the
initiation and severity of neuroinvasive disease is critical. There is incomplete understanding of what virus and
host determinants control or mediate WNV neuroinvasion, how the immune response to WNV within the CNS is
initiated and regulated, and how the acute response to WNV influences long-term inflammatory sequelae of
WNV encephalitis. The goal of the proposed studies is to address these knowledge gaps by gaining a molecular
understanding of WNV neuroinvasion, CNS immunity, and inflammatory sequelae. We will do this by deploying
newly-developed unique mouse models, recombinant forms of WNV, and an array of single-cell and spatial
transcriptomic and epigenomic methods. First, we will define the cells that initiate the immune response to WNV
in the periphery, and the targets of the cytokines produced by this response that control WNV neuroinvasion.
Second, we will define the signaling circuits by which WNV initiates and propagates inflammatory responses
within the CNS. Third and finally, we will use a recombinant WNV strain expressing Cre recombinase to mark
CNS cells that survive WNV infection and assess their contribution to persistent inflammatory sequelae that
persist after WNV clearance. New understanding gained from the proposed studies will significantly advance our
understanding of the determinants and consequences of WNV neuroinvasive disease, and will inform ongoing
efforts to mitigate and ameliorate these consequences in human patients."

Obesity is an important comorbidity for worse outcomes from infectious diseases and following vaccination. In 
humans and mouse models, obesity is associated with severe outcomes from influenza A virus (IAV) infection 
and inferior protection after influenza vaccination. In non-obese humans and mouse models, we have shown 
that biological sex plays significant role on IAV pathogenesis and immune responses, mediated by differences 
in sex steroid hormones and sex chromosomes. However, at present we do not know anything regarding how 
biological sex modifies the outcomes of IAV infection and immunity in obese population. Obese males and 
females differ with each other in terms of adiposity, adipokines availability, and inflammatory cells and cytokine 
concentrations. Therefore, we hypothesize that obesity alters the outcomes of IAV infection and vaccine-induced 
immunity and protection in a sex-specific manner. Using a mouse model of obesity, in aim 1, we will study sex 
differences during IAV pathogenesis while aim 2 will experiment sex-specific differences in IAV-vaccine induced 
immunity and protection. Associations of adipokines, inflammatory cells and cytokines, B and T-cell responses, 
and sex steroid hormones with IAV pathogenesis and immune responses will be explored among obese and 
non-obese male and female mice. Thus, this study will fill the critical gap existing in our understanding of 
interaction between biological sex and obesity during IAV infection and immunity. This will open new avenues to 
optimize influenza therapeutics and vaccines with better protective efficacies for the obese population."

Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common human
genetic cancer predisposition syndrome. Individuals with NF1 suffer from a wide range of malignant and
nonmalignant clinical manifestations including plexiform neurofibromas (PNF), complex precancerous lesions
which affect 25-40% of NF1 patients and cause major lifelong morbidity and mortality. A subset of these tumors
will progress to atypical neurofibroma (ANF) and a highly aggressive form of sarcoma called malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumor, which represents the leading cause of premature death in persons with NF1. In recent work,
we utilized novel preclinical genetically engineered murine models (GEMMs) that accurately recapitulate the
development of PNF and their progression to ANF and MPNST. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence in a
mechanistically linked preclinical and phase 2 clinical trial utilizing the multi-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
inhibitor cabozantinib, identifying TAM family kinases (AXL and MERTK) as a probable key kinase target
associated with treatment responses in PNF. Using these GEMMs, we demonstrate that AXL, in particular is
highly expressed across a spectrum of PNF, ANF, and MPNST. In further preliminary studies, we found that
cabozantinib can delay or prevent the malignant transformation of a subset of PNF/ANF in these GEMMs. We
also have preliminary clinical data where a NF1 patient, who developed a MPNST, achieved a sustained anti-
tumor response upon being treated at our Pediatric Cancer Precision Genomics Clinic after genome analysis
found the tumor overexpressed AXL.
While we have shown that cabozantinib modulates TAM family kinases including AXL and MERTK, and is
effective clinically in treating PNF in adult NF1 patients, its broad target profile did result in a number of low grade
AEs that led a significant number of participants to discontinue therapy. To overcome this barrier, we will
determine (Aims 1 and 2) whether a novel, first in class inhibitor of TAM receptor signaling (bavituximab and its
murine analogue mch1N11) or an AXL specific small molecule inhibitor, (bemcentinib) alone or in combination
with a MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, or a CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib) can effectively treat existing PNF and delay
or even prevent the progression of PNF/ANF to MPNST in GEMMs and patient derived xenograft models of
NF1-associated MPNST. Circulating levels of soluble AXL (sAXL) will be explored as a putative biomarker of
treatment response which could be monitored non-invasively in human subjects to further validate the potential
prognostic value found in recent phase 2 trials in PNF and other human cancers. Collectively, these studies
provide basic insights into the role of TAM receptor signaling in modulating tumor biology in an orphan cancer
predisposition syndrome, and serve to catalyze clinical translation of new therapeutic strategies where current
options remain exceedingly limited."

10914775,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Increasing the coverage of HIV testing and treatment among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is essential for
ending the global AIDS epidemic. Unfortunately, compared to women, men living with HIV (MLHIV) are less
likely to know their HIV status, start anti-retroviral treatment, or achieve viral suppression. Given that new HIV
infections among women are driven, in part, by men’s testing and treatment gaps, reducing the gender gap in
testing uptake, treatment initiation and achievement of viral suppression by men must be prioritized in order to
accelerate the decline in HIV incidence among women, improve men’s HIV-related health outcomes and achieve
the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals by 2030. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of Undetectable Equals
Untransmittable or “U=U” messaging for closing the gender gap in the HIV cascade. The U=U message
communicates the compelling idea that PLHIV who take ART and have an undetectable viral load (<200
copies/mL) cannot sexually transmit HIV. Particularly for men, the U=U message has the potential to accelerate
progress towards the 95-95-95 targets by: 1) reducing anxiety associated with HIV testing (1st 95); 2) encouraging
people who test HIV-positive to initiate ART (2nd 95); and 3) reducing fear of transmitting HIV to sexual partners
by promoting treatment adherence to achieve viral suppression (3rd 95). While there is a growing knowledge of
Treatment as Prevention (TasP)/U=U among PLWH in Western countries, the reach and penetration of the U=U
message in sub-Saharan Africa has been limited and few studies have tested the impacted of accessible U=U
messages on ART uptake and adherence in sub-Saharan Africa. Building on our prior work on U=U messaging
informed by behavioral economics and human-centered design, we propose to conduct two hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trials to evaluate the impact of U=U messages on men’s
uptake of community-based HIV testing and treatment initiation (Aim 1), and achievement of viral suppression
(Aim 2). We will also conduct a multi-method evaluation to inform future implementation of U=U messaging
interventions. To improve the generalizability of our findings, we will conduct our study in two provinces in South
Africa (Western and Eastern Cape). If effective, our intervention can shape global HIV testing and treatment
counselling guidelines and practices. Our expert, multi-institutional collaborations will allow us to apply previous
research findings, leverage unique implementation platforms and resources, and rapidly disseminate our
findings."

Limited participation of racial/ethnic minorities in therapeutic clinical trials perpetuates cancer care disparities.
Not only do racial/ethnic minority patients have limited access to state-of-the art care offered through a clinical
trial, but the small numbers of racial/ethnic minority participants reduces the generalizability of findings, thereby
limiting the clinical use of new treatments. The vast majority of racial/ethnic minorities receive their care in
community settings with community physicians. Increasing racial/ethnic minority referral and enrollment in
clinical trials requires consideration of multiple levels of influence. Community patients, community physicians,
and cancer center physicians all face barriers to referral and enrollment of racial/ethnic minorities to clinical trials
including: knowledge, attitudes, trust, and logistics. To address these challenges, we have
designed Advancing Clinical Trials: Working through Outreach via Navigation and Digital Enabled Referral and
Recruitment Strategies (ACT WONDER2S), driven by longstanding community partnerships to address the
needs of medically underserved populations, research to address racial/ethnic minority accrual to trials,
and a highly integrated digitally driven approach to precision cancer care and clinical trials. Our multilevel
intervention includes strategies that are delivered via a community health educator (CHE) and/or through digital
approaches for the community patient (education, patient portal, CHE support), community physician
(education, trial connect portal, cancer center physician engagement, and CHE support), and cancer center
physician (education, trial connect portal, CHE support, recruitment dashboard). ACT WONDER2S will be
implemented in identified priority zones within the catchment area of Moffitt Cancer Center that have a higher
cancer burden among Black and/or Hispanic populations. Our primary outcome is minority enrollment to NCI-
sponsored therapeutic clinical trials among Black and Hispanic patients with cancer in the two-year period
following intervention. In a three-phase approach based on learner verification and user-centered design, we
aim to: 1) Refine and finalize the ACT WONDER2S intervention components by conducting interviews
assessing preferences for the design and functionality of the CHE-led and digitally driven interventions; 2)
Implement and evaluate the impact of ACT WONDER2S on racial/ethnic minority patient referral and enrollment
on NCI-sponsored cancer treatment trials using a historical control design; 3) Assess implementation outcomes
and identify barriers and facilitators to ACT WONDER2S. This innovative intervention is unique in its multilevel
systems approach that utilizes digital tools accessible to community patients, community physicians, and cancer
center physicians, which is coupled with support from CHEs for each of these stakeholders. Our use of geospatial
analytics to identify priority zones is a unique strength, along with methodological innovations that will integrate
learner verification, user centered design, and implementation science to refine intervention components and
make ACT WONDER2S a success."

 The small nucleotide c-di-AMP is a ubiquitous second messenger produced by thousands of bacterial and
archeal species. Many bacteria, especially those in the Firmicutes phylum, require c-di-AMP for growth in
standard laboratory media, and the mechanisms for c-di-AMP essentiality have been extensively studied.
However, in a wide range of c-di-AMP-producing bacteria, including those for which c-di-AMP is completely
dispensable, unregulated c-di-AMP accumulation is toxic, diminishing bacterial growth and stress response.
Thus, c-di-AMP homeostasis is critical for bacteria that produce it. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that regulate
c-di-AMP levels in the bacterial cell, and the mechanisms by which c-di-AMP regulates different cellular pathways
to achieve optimal physiology, are both poorly understood. My lab found that c-di-AMP levels are dynamic in the
bacterial cell, and c-di-AMP hydrolysis is a key mechanism to modulate c-di-AMP levels. Furthermore, we have
generated bacterial mutants lacking c-di-AMP phosphodiesterases, called pde mutants, and extensively studied
their phenotypic defects. In the next five years, we will investigate two major aspects of c-di-AMP signaling: i)
the signal detection and regulatory mechanisms of c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase, and ii) the mechanisms by
which c-di-AMP coordinates its molecular targets to achieve optimal physiology and stress response. For the
second theme, we will take two complementary approaches. One, we will elucidate the biological functions of c-
di-AMP molecular targets based on targeted phenotypic, genetic, and biochemical analyses. Two, we will identify
the molecular targets underlying the toxicity phenotypes of pde mutants, through genetic fitness assays. Our
findings will reveal fundamental mechanisms of c-di-AMP signaling, and these mechanisms will provide a
framework to understand the global regulatory roles of c-di-AMP in the physiology of different bacterial species."

Many cancer-related independent studies that employ bulk and single cell RNA-seq remain under reused due to
their lower findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The data from these studies can be found in
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) but it is provided mostly as raw FASTQ files with non-uniform metadata
annotations. While some studies provide aligned reads files, these are processed non-uniformly. This
shortcoming makes it difficult to query and integrate this data across studies and with additional external data.
To bridge the gap that currently exists between RNA-seq data generation and RNA-seq data processing and
reuse, we developed the resource All RNA-seq and ChIP-Seq Sample and Signature Search (ARCHS4).
ARCHS4 provides processed RNA-seq data from GEO to support retrospective data analyses and reuse.
ARCHS4 caters to users with different levels of computational expertise and has been already employed for
many post-hoc analyses and projects. The goals go far beyond just providing cancer researchers with direct
access to RNA-seq data through a web-based user interface. We plan to transform other transcriptomics data
into RNA-seq-like profiles with Deep Learning, identify pathogenic sequences in human RNA-seq samples,
identify short variants from RNA-seq reads, predict gene function from co-expression data including ways to
modulate the expression of long non-coding RNAs with small molecules, and most importantly, using the
ARCHS4 cost-effective infrastructure, continue to provide a free FASTQ alignment service to the community."

 The Administrative Supplement requests support for costs arising from unanticipated expenses to conduct
preclinical studies required by the FDA and to be able to continue our Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical
trial of the novel smoking cessation pharmacotherapy on our current active U01 grant U01DA054882. The
required preclinical studies were not expected and thus not planned for but are now necessary to preserve the
overall impact of the project consistent with its originally approved Specific Aims and overall objectives.
 Our current grant aims to advance the clinical development of a novel smoking cessation
pharmacotherapy into first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1 and early Phase 2A efficacy clinical trials, subsequent to
obtaining FDA approval of the IND for these clinical trials. This novel small-molecule drug candidate is a new
chemical entity with a first-in-class pharmacological mechanism targeting the α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor (nAChR) subtype. The objectives of our currently funded grant U01DA054882 are to conduct a Phase
1 single- and multiple-ascending dose (SAD/MAD) FIH trial to assess the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in humans, and to conduct an efficient Early Phase 2 trial using a crossover
procedure that will provide an early readout of medication efficacy for smoking cessation and a Go/No-go
decision to advance this novel first-in-class candidate to subsequent larger randomized Phase 2 trials.
 As required by the FDA, our experienced drug development team has designed preclinical studies in rat to
address the FDA questions and obtained FDA feedback on the proposed studies to be conducted. The
Administrative supplement requests additional funding for these unanticipated studies, which will allow us to
continue our clinical trial and meet the overall objectives of our grant."

We seek renewal of the core operating funding for The Reactome Knowledgebase. Reactome is a manually
curated, peer-reviewed open access biological pathway knowledgebase that can be publicly used and
redistributed by all biological research community members. The Reactome knowledgebase is used by
academic, nonprofit and for-profit entities worldwide. Specifically, Reactome is employed by genomics and
proteomics researchers, clinicians, geneticists, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of large-scale
omics screening projects, by data scientists and bioinformaticians to develop novel approaches for knowledge
discovery and mining, and by systems biologists to build predictive models of normal and disease pathways for
drug discovery. Our curators, PhD-level scientists, work closely with independent investigators within the
community to assemble human- and machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways manually
using dedicated software tools. Each pathway is checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its
factual accuracy and compliance with the data model. A system of evidence tracking ensures that all assertions
are supported by the primary literature. Reactome uses community-standard controlled vocabularies and
ontologies to increase interoperability across resources. Pathways are reviewed and updated regularly.
Reactome pathways are available on our web site for browsing, downloading, and manipulation by in-house
and third-party online analysis tools. The project is highly cited in the literature, has been used repeatedly to
make significant biological discoveries, and is incorporated into a large number of high-impact computational
tools and resources. Over the next five years, we will: (1) efficiently curate normal and disease processes, and
effects of genetic variation and drugs on protein function; (2) improve pathway data analysis and input tools to
increase the curation efficiency and the utility of Reactome data in large-scale biological data science projects;
(3) enhance the open Reactome platform; and (4) conduct active outreach efforts to facilitate user engagement,

intellectual and laboratory resources for trainees interested in basic research. Extensive mentoring and
educational programs in responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor continue to enhance the quality of
the training experiences. Additionally, the ongoing support of the NIH-funded Autoimmunity Prevention Center,
the Studies of the Etiology of Rheumatoid Arthritis (SERA), a rapidly expanding Colorado Center for
Personalized Medicine, newly established programs in spondyloarthritis pathogenesis and prevention, and the
Colorado School of Public Health further facilitate a comprehensive training environment. The training program
will remain for this competing renewal under the direction of Dr. Michael Holers, Professor of Medicine and

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most deleterious of DNA lesions and, if not
handled properly, can lead to gross chromosome aberrations, neoplastic transformation of cells, and
tumorigenesis. The NCI-funded research program of the Unit Director Dr. Patrick Sung has focused
on elucidating conserved homologous recombination (HR) mechanisms, by which DSBs are being
faithfully repaired. Through a transdisciplinary approach encompassing biochemical reconstitution,
biophysical analysis, structural biology, and cell-based investigations, the Sung laboratory has
provided insights into critical steps of HR. The available experimental and intellectual framework
ideally positions us to continue delineating the mechanistic intricacy of HR and DSB repair processes,
to provide actionable information for explaining why HR gene mutations lead to genome instability,
replication fork demise, neoplastic cell transformation, and cancer.
As Research Associate Professor, I have been making contributions in elucidating the underlying
mechanisms of three critical stages of HR, namely, RAD51 presynaptic filament assembly, DNA
strand invasion, and repair DNA synthesis. I have also played a key role in the training and mentoring

at elucidating the multifaceted roles that the tumor suppressors BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2, FANCJ,
and their companion HR factors fulfill in the aforementioned stages of the HR process and in DNA
replication fork preservation. As such, the R50 Research Specialist Award will not only help advance
our research objectives, but will also exert a broader impact in the DNA repair and cancer biology
fields as I continue to devise novel biochemical assays and systems reconstituted with purified HR
factors to facilitate the studies of other laboratories, and will help identify novel targets and pathway
pivot points to spur the development of small molecule compounds as chemical biology tools and
potential cancer therapeutics. 【 I will continue to advise the Unit Director in all matters concerning
the general directions of our research program, take on major responsibilities in mentoring and
training of doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows, and act as the main conduit with intramural

Use of bisphosphonate (BP) medications for the prevention of fractures is declining, partially due to patient and
provider fears about the occurrence of atypical femur fractures (AFF), which are clearly associated with long-
term bisphosphonate use. Many individuals are choosing to not use these medications at all rather than risk
having this rare outcome. This decision may leave individuals at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Balancing
the risk of typical osteoporosis-related fractures, such as hip or vertebral fractures, with the risk of the much rarer
AFF, is an important component of decision-making by physicians and patients about medication use. Further,
an understanding of which subgroups of women may be at greater or lesser risk of AFF will be useful when
making clinical decisions about initiation of medication, duration of treatment, and use of drug holidays. The
proposed study will address these issues by combining individual-level data from three large, population-based
cohort studies with radiographically verified AFFs, comprehensive longitudinal medication exposure, data
harmonized definitions of other covariables, and centrally coordinated statistical programming. We will be
focusing on two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the risks of long-term use of BP for the prevention of
AFF by determining the independent effects of BP treatment and drug holidays on AFF risk, including the
potential interplay between pre-holiday duration of treatment and duration of holiday. In novel exploratory
analyses, we will determine the effects of re-initiation of BPs after a drug holiday. We will also evaluate the
relationships between AFF risk and the use of other fracture prevention medications (e.g., intravenous BPs,
denosumab and SERMs), other potential risk factors (e.g., physical activity, bone mineral density (BMD), race),
and comorbidities. In Aim 2, we will use the pooled data from our 3 cohorts to develop and validate predictive
models incorporating patterns of long-term BP treatment, drug holidays and clinical risk factors, to
comprehensively model the expected fracture protection and potential harms for individual patients and evaluate
the group-level balance between AFF risk and osteoporosis-related fracture prevention. These models will allow
clinicians to quantify individualized risk, balancing the benefits and harms of bisphosphonate treatment
accounting for other risk factors. Development of these predictive tools and addressing important gaps in the
scientific evidence related to BP treatment, drug holidays, and re-initiation of BP or other anti-osteoporosis
medications will have an immediate positive impact on clinical practice and patient care by encouraging and
improving the optimal use of osteoporosis medications."

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria. They have important impacts on human health
through their significant effect on bacterial evolution and pathogenicity as well as from biotechnology
applications. Due to the increasing rise in multi-drug resistance by pathogenic bacteria, new interest has
arisen in developing phages as antibiotics, and they are further being exploited for developing therapeutic
drugs and vaccines. We have long studied the genetics and structure of phage HK97 and others that are
similar to the well-known phage lambda (λ) and belong to the very large family of double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) tailed phages. The capsid of HK97 encloses the viral genome and assembles from multiple
copies of three subunits – the major capsid protein that includes an assembly (scaffolding) domain, the
protease that removes the scaffold domain after assembly, and a portal protein that assembles as a ring
to initiate capsid assembly, and through which the genome enters and exits the capsid. Interactions
between these subunits are key to understanding assembly and the subsequent maturation that removes
the scaffold domain, enables packaging of the dsDNA, and transforms the capsid into the expanded
mature form. We have developed the tools to explore these processes by mutational and structural
analyses and generated compelling preliminary data on which this proposal is based. An important basis
for the project is structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) of the first assembled
capsid revealing the unique portal vertex and the organization of the scaffold domain relative to the portal.
Although still at modest resolution, this structure elegantly explains a long-standing puzzle about the
symmetry mismatch between the 12-fold portal ring and the 5 capsomers surrounding it. With this model
we can begin investigating the assembly functions of the subunits through existing and new mutants
probing the portal-scaffold domain interface. We aim to develop this study in three directions. In Aim 1
we will extend the study of the portal organization to higher resolution and explore the consequences of
mutations in the scaffolding domain and the portal, the two components that form the interfaces between
the portal and the major capsid protein. In Aim 2 we will model changes that happen after the initial capsid
assembles as it progresses through proteolysis of the scaffold domain and expansion the mature capsid
conformation. In Aim 3 we will compare assembly of the HK97 capsid with those of several phages with
close structural similarities but which assemble capsids of a different (larger) size from HK97. The
significance of this work is in filling knowledge gaps of how this large family of phages assemble capsids
of varying icosahedral geometry from very similar building blocks, providing a framework for their
development as therapies and use in vaccine research."

Immune checkpoint receptor (ICR) blockade as a cancer treatment strategy has yielded favorable response
rates in some solid tumor types, yet cellular mechanisms of immune escape have resulted in limited efficacy
in other tumors, including high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Our long-term goal is to understand the link
between DNA damage repair (DDR) and HGSC immunogenicity, in order to develop combinatorial
treatments for HGSC through DDR inhibition that turn hypoimmunogenic or “cold” HGSC into “hot” tumors
with improved responses to immunotherapy. The current knowledge regarding DDR in HGSC has focused on
the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the link
between other DDR pathways and immune response; the objective of this proposal is to bridge that gap so
that we can address the unmet need of treatment strategies for HGSC patients for whom immunotherapy or
PARP inhibitor therapy, either alone or in combination, is ineffective. Our central hypothesis is that the
inhibition of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is a novel immune priming strategy to
sensitize cold HGSC to immune checkpoint blockade. Through the characterization of the role of NHEJ
protein DEK in the pathogenesis of HGSC, we have identified a downstream targetable kinase, aurora kinase
A (AURKA), that serves as a novel and potent checkpoint against DNA damage and type-I interferon (IFN-I)
signaling. To test our central hypothesis, we will focus on three specific aims. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis
that the inhibition of NHEJ results in robust IFN-I signaling. Aim 2. To characterize the mechanism by which the
inhibition of NHEJ induces immune cell activation. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that NHEJ inhibition sensitizes
cold HGSC to immune checkpoint blockade. The experiments for these aims will be carried out using human
HGSC cell lines with known BRCA mutation status and HR-proficiency or HR-deficiency as well as primary,
patient derived tumor cells established in cell culture. To characterize the immune changes following NHEJ
inhibition in tumor cells and the interplay with host immune cells, we will employ the ID8/p53-/- and ID8/p53-/-
/BRCA1-/- mouse cell lines on the C57BL/6 background to allow for studies utilizing established genetic
knockouts of critical IFN-I signaling proteins. A second, genetically engineered mouse model of HGSC will also
be studied. As outcomes of our work, we expect our findings to contribute to our understanding of the link
between NHEJ and tumor immunogenicity. Furthermore, this work will provide critical insights into treatment
strategies for HR proficient and BRCA wild-type cancers in which current PARP inhibitor-based therapies are
less effective. These contributions will be significant, as they will define the underlying mechanisms and lead to
effective combinatorial strategies for the treatment of HGSC and other solid malignancies, allowing us to move
forward with immediate translation to clinical trials."
10916365,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to provide bioinformatics support to advance research into the misregulation of
transcription elongation in oncogenesis. For example, translocation of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene
with a variety of genes expressing regulators of transcription elongation result in acute myeloid or acute lymphoid
leukemia. Many of these factors are subunits of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), which can enhance
transcription elongation by two submodules: the positive regulator of transcription factor b (P-TEFb), which
signals for the release of paused Pol II, and the RNA processivity factor ELL. A common denominator of these
projects is the need for meticulous, biologically relevant computational analysis, which ultimately have several
functions: decoding next generation sequencing data into a useful set of findings, combining data from multiple
experimental platforms for a multi-dimensional perspective, and integrating machine learning approaches to
extract data-specific signatures. These functions serve the goal of helping researchers, beginning with study
design, data analysis, and further hypothesis building, to advance our understanding of cancer biology and to
help evaluate cancer therapeutics. Dr. Iwanaszko will be responsible for implementing these approaches and
providing expertise in both bioinformatics and computational biology to support cancer biologists in extracting
more information from their data, speeding up the analysis, and to maintain a high standard of scientific rigor
and reproducibility."
10916186,"While studying mechanisms of metastasis in osteosarcoma, we discovered that individual tumor cells respond
differently when exposed to the foreign lung environment. Our early data suggest a hypothesis: that a small
group of tumor cells survives the initial encounter with the lungs by stopping cell division and liberally producing
inflammatory cytokines. The reaction of these rare “anchor” cells changes the surrounding lung tissue in ways
that prepare it for colonization by rapidly proliferating tumor cells (“growth” cells). The cytokines released by
anchor cells appear to alter the behavior of the surrounding lung cells, prompting a wound healing response.
Unlike the normal wound healing response, however, this wound never heals.
The environment created by this wound response is markedly different from that of the normal, healthy lung.
Most importantly, cells and cytokines that make up the wound create an environment where growth cells not only
survive, but proliferate rapidly, outcompeting the anchor cells to become the dominant subtype within the
metastatic tumor. Here, we outline a research plan to test this hypothesis, rigorously evaluating our proposed
mechanisms that establish the early metastatic niche and asking whether chemotherapy selectively kills growth
cells, inadvertently leaving anchor cells intact to re-establish metastases once therapy ceases.
The project is divided into three Aims. Aim 1 tests hypotheses relating to the mechanisms by which anchor cells
create a fertile metastatic niche by activating the wound-healing machinery of the lung and facilitates
identification of the lung-to-tumor signals that make this a fertile environment for growth cells.
In the second Aim, we will determine how anchor and growth cells come about—whether distinct clones come
pre-programmed for anchor or growth cell activity or whether dynamic developmental processes regulate
maintenance of subpopulations within each tumor. Understanding this will be important for designing treatment
regimens that maintain efficacy while minimizing toxicity.
Finally, we will evaluate the use of pharmacologic inhibitors that target anchor cells directly or indirectly to see if
these can augment the effects of conventional therapies and overcome resistance and relapse. By identifying
agents that selectively target anchor cells, we can develop combination regimens that target both groups of
tumor cells, rendering resistant disease treatable.
The cooperation between cancer cells with discrete behaviors has immediate implications for treatment and
suggests a need to develop strategies that target both growth cells and anchor cells. This work could drive a
paradigm shift that would revolutionize the care of patients with osteosarcoma."

Targeted Neural Text Summarization of Electronic Medical Records to Improve Imaging
Diagnosis
Electronic health records (EHRs) contain a wealth of patient information that might inform diagnostic
and therapeutic decision-making. However, much of this information is unstructured (i.e., free-text). This
makes it difficult to find the few relevant notes that might inform a given decision amongst lengthy
patient records, in turn rendering key information buried within EHR practically inaccessible to domain
experts operating under time constraints. Consequently, clinical decisions are often made without the
benefit of all available data. We propose to design, train, and deploy novel natural language processing
(NLP) models that provide extractive summaries of the free-text data within EHR conditioned on
particular queries; the intent is for such models to aid diagnosis and decision-making. We also propose to
use these models to try and counteract the cognitive biases that domain experts bring to clinical practice.
We focus specifically on the important and illustrative area of radiology, although the approach will
generalize to other specialties. Radiologists performing imaging diagnosis do not have adequate time to
carefully read through patient histories stored within EHR; they must instead make do with limited
background information when interpreting imaging. We will build on our preliminary on models that
summarize textual evidence extracted from EHR that might support particular hypothesized diagnoses.
We envision an interactive system in which this model is used by the radiologist to surface textual
evidence that supports different potential conditions that might be suggested by the imaging.
Radiologists (and other domain experts) rely on heuristics — type 1 thinking — when making decisions
under time constraints. This results in various cognitive biases influencing diagnoses, and these have
been shown to be the source of a significant fraction of diagnostic errors in radiology. We propose a novel
secondary use of the NLP models to be developed for this project as a means of counteracting these
cognitive biases. Specifically, once the radiologist has indicated an initial potential diagnosis via a natural
language query, we will automatically present a few alternative plausible diagnosis and summaries of the
extracted evidence supporting these (alongside the summary of evidence relevant to the initial query).
These alternative diagnoses will be gleaned from gamuts or published lists of differential diagnoses, and
we will re-rank them in order of their predicted probability for the current patient according a trained
machine learning model. We will evaluate the proposed models in practice at Brigham and Women's
Hospital, and assess the degree to which integrating automatically generated summaries actually affects
clinical decision-making at point of care."
10914560,"Of all the poisoning syndromes associated with harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins, ciguatera poisoning (CP) is
the most prevalent globally and is estimated to afflict tens of thousands of people each year, with many cases
unreported. CP is primarily caused by the consumption of reef fish (and some invertebrates) contaminated with
toxins that originate from species of the (sub)tropical benthic/epiphytic dinoflagellate genera Gambierdiscus and
Fukuyoa (hereafter referred to together as Gambierdiscus). CP is predicted to increase in geographic range and
frequency in the Greater Caribbean region (GCR) and elsewhere in response to climate change. We established
the Greater Caribbean Center for Ciguatera Research (GCCCR) through the Centers of Oceans and Human
Health (COHH3) program to study the anticipated intensification of CP in the GCR due to warming sea surface
temperatures and reef degradation associated with climate change. The major goals of GCCCR in COHH3 are
to: 1) examine the role climate change may play in the geographic and temporal expansion of ciguatera poisoning
(CP) into more temperate latitudes (Research Project 1); 2) obtain a better understanding of the toxic metabolites
produced by certain Gambierdiscus strains, and the subsequent transfer and biotransformation of these
compounds into coastal/reef food webs (Research Project 2); 3) study the genotoxicity and impacts on cellular
metabolism caused by these toxins upon exposure (Research Project 3), in order to 4) better protect and treat
people from this malady by translating the above scientific findings into risk-based outputs for engagement and
education activities for the community in the Greater Caribbean Region (Community Engagement Core). While
the GCCCR has been productive to date, Hurricane Ian severely hindered progress, particularly in Florida and
specifically at FGCU. Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida (near FGCU) on September 28, 2022.
The 10’+ storm surge caused significant damage to our coasts, including the FGCU Vester Field Station in Bonita
Springs, Florida. This damage has rendered Vester inoperable to date. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, PD
Parsons had to spend considerable time and effort coordinating clean-up and repairs. Additionally, adjusting
our research activities has been challenging (no dock access; damaged boats; inaccessible sampling sites).
While repairs are underway, we have lost considerable time (and resources), hindering our progress and ability
to complete our remaining tasks in the COHH3 project of GCCCR. Herein, we are requesting an Administrative
Supplement to address the infrastructure impacts including replacement of research resources, one lost boat,
and financial assistance with building repairs and renovations."
10914561,"Project Summary
The use of in vivo imaging and modulation tools to study neural function in the visual system have the potential
to deliver transformative scientific discoveries and advance translational science. In particular, calcium imaging
and optogenetics provide cell-type specific resolution of the neural circuits involved in visual processing and
behavior. Despite the major advances in technology, and the enthusiastic use of these tools in rodent and
smaller animal models for basic neuroscience applications, these approaches have been incorporated relatively
slowly in large-brain animal models that have neural and perceptual functions more similar to humans (e.g., non-
human primates, ferrets, and others). Further, although these methods can provide significant advantages for
translational studies, they are not commonly used in disease models for pre-clinical testing and optimization in
the eye or brain. The slow implementation of these methods in both in the eye and in large brain animal models
is largely due to the complexity of establishing the hardware and viral transfection parameters to consistently
perform these experiments. Issues relating to, eye and respiratory movements that distort light delivery and
recording, immune responses, anesthesia and limited signal to noise, particularly deep in tissue all play a role.
Yet, these are common challenges faced by the in vivo imaging community that are readily overcome with shared
expertise and new technical advances are continuously pushing back the boundaries of what is possible. This
application proposes a 2.5 day symposium that brings together world-leading scientists, engineers, and clinicians
from around the world to discuss major progress in cutting-edge neural imaging and modulation methods to
study function in the visual system in vivo. A major goal of the conference is to promote in depth discussions and
knowledge-transfer between investigators to implement ‘best practices’ for neural imaging and modulation of
activity in the visual system. Moreover, we provide a set of career development workshops aimed at increasing
diversity and representation in vision research. We have devised a strategic plan to attract scientists-in-training
(graduate students and postdocs) to the conference. In particular, we have invited a great mix of established and
junior faculty with strong record in mentoring, provided ample speaking opportunities at the conference to these
young investigators, and will award a generous number of travel awards to these young scientists to attend the
conference. Their participation will shape and implement the new path forward to making discoveries in the visual
system using these cutting-edge tools."

10912719,"Invasive candidiasis is the most common invasive fungal disease, and uncomplicated candidemia is the most
common presentation. Randomized controlled trials in adults and a prospective observational study in children
demonstrated primary treatment with an echinocandin antifungal improved outcomes. While these data inform
initial therapy choice, there remains a paucity of data regarding appropriate duration of therapy. Current
guidelines recommend 14 total days of antifungal therapy for candidemia regardless of clinical presentation and
initial response, yet this is based on opinion and not comparative data. Several studies have proven that shorter
durations of antibacterial therapy are safe and effective for the treatment of numerous serious bacterial
infections. However, there has been no comparative study to assess shorter versus standard duration therapy
for any invasive fungal disease. A large proportion of pediatric invasive candidiasis is uncomplicated candidemia
with relatively rapid clinical improvement on primary echinocandin therapy. It is hypothesized that these patients
do not require 14 days of therapy and instead would be effectively treated with a shorter duration. The primary
objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether 7 more days of therapy is necessary after
completing an initial 7days of echinocandin therapy for pediatric candidemia. Subjects initially treated with an
echinocandin showing clinical improvement with blood culture clearance will be randomized at 7 days into one
of two arms: 1) cessation of therapy, or 2) continuation of therapy for 14 total days. This primary aim will include
a novel outcome measure, the desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR), which simultaneously captures benefits
and negative consequences of treatment. We will compare the DOOR outcome in children randomized to receive
7 days of an echinocandin only (short-course) versus 7 days of echinocandin therapy followed by 7 more days
of antifungal therapy (standard-course). We hypothesize that subjects randomized to short-course therapy will
on average have a higher DOOR measure than subjects randomized to standard-course therapy. The secondary
objective will assess utility of a novel biomarker, the T2Candida® assay, to provide supporting evidence for
effectiveness of short course therapy. We previously demonstrated the T2Candida® assay can rapidly diagnose
invasive candidiasis in children. However, there are no data on the utility of a negative biomarker to support
cessation of therapy. Aim 2 will compare the 14-day DOOR measure for subjects with a negative or positive
T2Candida® biomarker at day 7 of therapy within each study group. We hypothesize that a negative T2Candida®
biomarker at day 7 will be associated with a higher DOOR measure at day 14. This study will leverage the
Pediatric Fungal Network (PFN), a multidisciplinary group composed of 37 sites across the US and the only such
group dedicated to pediatric invasive fungal disease. This will be the first randomized controlled trial to define
the optimal duration of therapy for any invasive fungal disease, and the first to explore the utility of a fungal
biomarker to support a shorter course. Results could impact numerous national and international guidelines."
10912720,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Yellow fever (YF) is a deadly disease transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Although
an effective vaccine for YF was invented in the 1930s, it is not amenable to large-scale production and has a
high rate of adverse events (including death). As a result, YF continues to kill approximately 30,000 people
each year. Moreover, due to the re-emergence of Aedes mosquito vectors, substantial portions of Southeast
Asia, Oceania, and even Europe and North America are at increasing risk for introduction of the YF virus
(YFV), which would be a public health disaster. In humans, YF presents as a classic viral hemorrhagic fever
(VHF), causing severe coagulation abnormalities (i.e. coagulopathy) and end-organ damage. This contrasts
with what happens in mice, where YFV infection is largely benign and characterized by a distinct lack of
coagulopathy/hemorrhagic features. The host factors that determine the development of VHF in YF in
humans are unknown. This project aims to identify these factors at both cellular and molecular levels.
Currently, VHF in YF is thought to be driven by the infection of hepatocytes. However, unpublished data
collected from Brazilian YF patients suggests that hepatocyte destruction alone is insufficient to explain the
coagulopathy observed in YF. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the infection of immune cells plays a
major (and previously underappreciated) role in the development of VHF in YF. This Aim will utilize YFV
infection of transgenic mice that have been engrafted with human hepatocytes or human immune cells – two
cell populations that are thought to play a major role in the VHF disease process – allowing the study YFV
infection of these cell populations in isolation in this otherwise YF-resistant host. A range of coagulation tests
will be performed on infected mice to determine the mechanism by which coagulopathy develops during YFV
infection. Blood samples drawn daily from YFV-infected macaques – the gold-standard animal model for
studying VHF in YF – also will be analyzed, as this will be essential for determining the timing and causal
relationships between key events such as clot formation, clotting factor depletion, and liver damage. In Aim 2,
a CRISPR-Cas9 genome wide knock-out screen will be performed utilizing human and mouse, hepatocyte and
Kupffer cell lines, to identify the factors that render humans (and primates) uniquely susceptible to YFV. The
factors that restrict YFV replication in the murine host – hypothesized to be an interferon-stimulated gene
(ISG) based on preliminary data – also will be identified. ‘Hits’ from this screen will be validated using
targeted gene knock-out and trans-complementation in vitro. This will identify host factors that are essential in
the YFV life cycle, and may lead to the generation of new YF-susceptible mouse models. This research will
generate information and biological tools that can be used to combat YF specifically, and VHF more generally.
This award will also help the principal investigator, Dr. Adam Bailey, MD, PhD, establish himself as an
independent researcher and enable him to pursue high-reward projects that would otherwise not be feasible."
10911112,"SUMMARY: Recognizing that over-diagnosis of many cancers is leading to over-treatment with adjuvant
chemotherapy or with radiation therapy boost, there is a growing appreciation for the need for prognostic and
predictive assays to identify those cancer patients who can benefit from therapy de-intensification. While multi-gene-expression based tests such as Oncotype DX and Decipher exist for identifying early-stage breast and
prostate cancer patients who could avoid adjuvant therapies and hence mitigate side-effects and complications,
the price of these tests ($3K-4K/patient) puts them beyond the reach of most patients in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). Ironically, the need for these prognostic and predictive tests is even more acute in LMICs like
India, where access to treatment resources like radiation and chemotherapy are limited and hence need to be
administered judiciously to those patients who stand to receive the most benefit from them.
 Sophisticated digital pathomic analysis with computer vision and pattern recognition tools has been
shown to “unlock” sub-visual attributes about tumor behavior and patient outcomes from hematoxylin & eosin
(H&E)-stained slides alone. The Madabhushi team at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) has extensively
shown the potential for these approaches for predicting outcome and therapeutic response for breast, head and
neck, lung and prostate cancer. The Madabhushi team working with collaborators Dr. Parmar and Dr. Desai at
the Tata Memorial Center (TMC), the largest cancer center in India, has shown that advanced pathomic analysis
is able to identify unique prognostic morphologic signatures of breast cancer that are different between South
Asian (SA) and Caucasian American (CA) women 1. In addition, the CWRU group has shown that digital pathomic
based image classifiers can significantly improve and even outperform the prognostic and predictive
performance of expensive gene-expression assays for breast (Oncotype Dx) and prostate cancer (Decipher) 2.
 Building on the strong extant collaboration between CWRU and TMC 3, and a strong track record in digital
image based prognostic and predictive based assays, we propose to optimize and validate an AI-enabled Digital
Pathology Platform (ADAPT) for Multi-Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis and Prediction of Therapeutic Benefit.
ADAPT will involve optimizing the previously developed image assays by the CWRU group in the context of SA
cancer patients. Furthermore, by integrating the AI-pathomic tools with PathPresenter, a widely used digital
pathology image analysis platform, ADAPT will have a global footprint for the prognostic and predictive tools.
Specifically, ADAPT will be validated for predicting outcome and benefit of adjuvant chemo- and radiation therapy
in the context of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),
oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) and prostate cancer at TMC via a number of clinical trial datasets
in the US (SWOG S8814, RTOG 0920, 0521) and at TMC (AREST, POP-RT). Successful project completion
will establish ADAPT as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for Indian cancer patients."

Department of Health Sciences at The University of Chicago. Her long-term career goal is to lead a research
program that evaluates and guides the implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) into clinical practice in a
manner that advances health equity in genomic medicine. The proposed work leverages skills she developed
through prior training and research and will form the basis for a successful R01 proposal. The career
development plan includes didactic and experiential learning in pharmacogenomics; developing research skills
in implementation science; acquiring leadership skills for directing interdisciplinary, implementation research
teams; and maximizing professional development through a series of objectives. Dr. Saulsberry will also attend
seminars, journal clubs, laboratory and research meetings, grant-writing workshops, and present at national
meetings, which will all provide additional opportunities to develop and strengthen skills. The mentorship team
for the proposed interdisciplinary project covers the full translational cycle of PGx research to ensure training
and preparation for independence is comprehensive, incorporating knowledge of each stage of translation from
research to practice. The proposed studies build on Dr. Saulsberry's prior work in health disparities and chronic
illness; it investigates communication processes essential to PGx implementation, providing a foundation for
future studies that evolve approaches for delivering PGx care to patients at risk for health disparities. Aim 1
investigates the inter-ethnic disparities in the use of prescription drugs with evidence-based PGx guidelines
and assesses the potential impact of PGx testing on minority populations based on a nationally representative
dataset on health care utilization. Aim 2 determines the views of patient-provider pairs on PGx risk
communication through interviews/focus groups and examines inter-ethnic variation between patients' risk
communication preferences. Aim 3 uses a survey experiment to evaluate the influence of PGx risk information
on inter-ethnic patient beliefs and preferences for the clinical use of PGx. This proposal responds to the urgent
need to discover methods of tailoring PGx implementation to the expectations and needs of ethnically diverse
populations so as to not widen health disparities. The K08 award will lead to Dr. Saulsberry's transition to an
independent career in genomic medicine focused on designing and adapting PGx implementation that is

10911218,"This application describes a robust Southern California-based Clinical Center for participation in the Type 1
Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC). Proposed protocols address the metabolic mechanisms
and the genetic, protein, and imaging signature of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent acute
pancreatitis (RAP) who are at high risk for future development of diabetes. AP is the most common cause of
pancreatogenic diabetes. While meta-analyses have revealed an incidence rate of 23% for diabetes arising after
AP, they have not shed light on the type of diabetes that develops, which may comprise autoimmune or idiopathic
type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), or a unique diabetes pathobiology. A detailed understanding
of diabetes developing after AP will yield great benefit by facilitating novel approaches to predict, prevent, and
treat this form of diabetes. The following aims are proposed to address these goals:
 Specific Aim 1. Recruit a cohort of non-diabetic patients with a recent episode of AP or RAP and prospectively
characterize their islet autoimmunity and glucose/insulin homeostasis using the frequently sampled intravenous
glucose tolerance test and mixed meal tolerance tests performed 1 month after hospital discharge, and at 3, 6,
12, 18, and 24 months, and yearly thereafter. The goals of this aim are to (a) determine the incidence of diabetes
after AP, (b) identify the types of diabetes that develop after AP, (c) identify early metabolic trajectories
associated with post-AP diabetes, (d) assemble the cohort that will be the platform for Aims 2-4.
 Specific Aim 2. Evaluate genetic and protein risk factors for diabetes in patients with AP or RAP. This Aim
will evaluate association of genetic risk scores for T1DM and T2DM with post AP diabetes. Thirteen candidate
proteins, associated with post AP diabetes in preliminary studies, will be assessed for association with incident
diabetes after AP, yielding a key set of proteins with utility not only in diabetes prediction but also targets for
future preventive or therapeutic measures.
 Specific Aim 3. Characterize the imaging phenotype that predicts development of diabetes after AP or RAP.
Retrospective CT scans obtained during hospitalization for AP as well as CT and novel multiparametric MRI
scans obtained 1 and 12 months afterward will undergo artificial intelligence analysis to identify the imaging
biomarkers that signal diabetes risk.
 Specific Aim 4. Develop a multi-factorial model to predict development of diabetes after AP or RAP. A wealth
of data will be collected from Aims 1-3, which will be combined with clinical factors to build and validate (in
independent datasets) an integrative predictive model of post AP diabetes. The goal is to create a model that
can be used in clinical settings to identify those at highest risk, facilitating targeted measures to prevent diabetes.
 This innovative research will be conducted by an experienced team of investigators in endocrinology,
gastroenterology, imaging, physiology, and epidemiology to solve a problem of great public health significance."

10911273,"ABSTRACT
 Gliomas, including oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma subtypes, are a diverse group of malignant primary
brain tumors that respond to radiation, surgery and chemotherapy; however, relapse remains a major barrier
affecting overall patient survival. Immunotherapy targeting the adaptive immune system such as checkpoint
inhibitors has shown limited efficacy in gliomas. Thus, understanding the immunobiology of gliomas and
mechanisms of resistance to immune therapies is crucial to therapeutically leverage the immune system for
treating patients. Our long-term goal is to dissect the innate immune system in gliomas and identify vulnerabilities
that can be exploited for designing therapies.
 Recent studies have implicated a link between mutations in ATRX, a SWI-SNF chromatin remodeler and
immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of ATRX-mutant astrocytomas. Our preliminary data
suggest that ATRX inactivation in gliomas leads to enriched inflammatory signatures and potentiation of type I
interferon/pro-inflammatory signaling, and selective sensitization of tumors to double-stranded (dsRNA)-based
immune agonists. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that ATRX inactivation induces innate
inflammation and sensitizes tumors to immune surveillance and dsRNA agonist therapy; concurrent IDH
mutations suppress innate inflammation to enable tumor immune evasion. We will test our hypothesis in the
following specific aims. Aim 1: Define the role of ATRX inactivation in modulating glioma cell-intrinsic innate
signaling; Aim 2: Elucidate the role of ATRX deficiency and concurrent IDH1R132H mutation in modulating anti-
tumor immunity and the response to dsRNA agonist therapy in pre-clinical murine glioma models; Aim 3:
Determine the extent to which dsRNA-based therapies induce inflammatory activation of lower-grade gliomas.
 Our proposal will: 1) delineate the novel role of ATRX loss in regulating innate immune signaling responses
and their downstream effects in glioma, 2) examine the immunological interplay between ATRX mutations and
its partner mutation, IDH1R132H and 3) lay preclinical groundwork for exploiting a potential therapeutic vulnerability
in gliomas carrying ATRX mutations."

Project Summary/Abstract
Signaling-regulated transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate the developmental and differentiation trajectories of
cells as well as their activation states. Understanding TF activities at the single-cell level represents a formidable
challenge. Single-cell multi-omics technologies now measure different modalities such as RNA, surface proteins,
and chromatin states. Moreover, emerging spatial technologies offer highly multiplex profiling of RNAs and
proteins, while preserving spatial context of the tissue. Consequently, there is a tremendous need for
computational methods that can integrate these measurements and infer the underlying cell type- and state-
specific transcriptional programs. In response to this critical need, we developed SPaRTAN (Single-cell
Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network) and integrated parallel single-cell proteomic,
and transcriptomic data, based on Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq)
with cis-regulatory information (e.g. TF – target-gene priors) to predict cell-specific TF and surface protein
activities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to use CITE-seq data with cis-regulatory
information for linking cell-surface receptors to TFs and construct cell-specific signaling linked regulatory
programs. My research program develops interpretable machine learning approaches and computational tools
to identify and characterize signaling-regulated TFs and spatial transcriptional heterogeneity for more concise
understanding of cellular states. Here, we propose to advance our modeling efforts using context-specific
chromatin accessibility data and simultaneously extend SPaRTAN to handle multiple cell-types and/or samples
using multi-task and interpretable deep learning approaches based on single-cell multi-omics datasets (Goal 1).
We will further develop computational methods for delineating spatially-informed cell context-specific
transcriptional programs using spatial transcriptomics datasets (Goal 2). These methods will be integrated into
software packages to make them widely accessible to the research community. We will exploit our methods to
delineate cell context-specific TF activities that are both specific to humans and relevant to disease. Together,
proposed frameworks have the potential to fill an important gap in knowledge by defining cell context-specific
regulators driving cellular identity, as well as discover new targets and approaches for advancing therapy."
10912622,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an alarming public health problem that costs the US more than $249 billion
annually. AUDs leads to a devastatingly diverse set of negative health outcomes, including significantly
increased risk of hypertension, stroke, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple cancers, and
multiple types of cognitive dysfunction. Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are the only FDA-approved
medications for the treatment of AUD and are only modestly effective. Zonisamide (ZON) is an anticonvulsant
medication with GABAnergic, glutamatergic and monoaminergic effects which has shown significant promise
in animal and human laboratory settings, and small clinical trials for the treatment of AUD. ZON could represent
a critical new tool for clinicians, but previous studies have been limited by a couple of key factors (e.g., no
objective evidence recent alcohol consumption, no objective evidence of medication adherence) that this study
is designed to overcome. Theoretically framed within the Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment with
hypothesized mechanisms in core domains (i.e., incentive salience, negative emotionality and cognitive
function), and proceeding from a sound scientific premise we will target reduced alcohol use among AUD
patients in primary care using a carefully designed combination of contingency management (CM, or incentives
in exchange for objectively verified evidence of behavior) delivered at thrice-weekly visits during the first 4-
weeks of ZON treatment to jumpstart reductions in drinking. For the remaining 8-weeks of ZON, CM will be
delivered at weekly visits in exchange for evidence of 100% or higher medication adherence. The goal of this
study is to complete a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT to evaluate the ability of ZON to significantly
decrease alcohol use among treatment-seeking AUD adults. Individuals will be randomized into 1 of 2 trial arms
that will receive: 1) ZON plus standard treatment (ST), which includes Take Control bibliotherapy modules and
CM through the 12-week treatment period (ZON+ST), or 2) Matched placebo plus ST (PLO+ST). The primary
outcome will be biochemically-verified alcohol use during the treatment period. We will use a 2-week, single-
blind placebo induction period wherein participants will be required to demonstrate a 75% medication
adherence rate before continuing into the 12-week treatment period. Follow-up will occur at 1, 6 and 12-months.
Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine if ZON+ST is more effective than PLO+ST for reducing biochemically-
verified alcohol use and other alcohol use outcomes; 2) Identify ANA-based mediators of treatment response
across the treatment groups; 3) Determine a.) if biological sex, baseline depression and baseline severity of
alcohol use interacts with treatment assignment to produce differential changes in our primary and secondary
outcomes; and b.) whether groups differ on adverse events or medication adherence. This project focuses on
the efficacy of a promising pharmacotherapy for AUDs using a double-blind placebo-controlled design that will
rigorously measure alcohol use and medication adherence."
10912736,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In recent years there has emerged a striking realization that liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic
acids is responsible for the formation of various intracellular membraneless organelles. Examples of organelles
formed by phase separation are nucleoli and Cajal bodies in the nucleus and stress granules and P granules in
the cytoplasm. The phase separation of protein-RNA composites, in particular, is being appreciated for crucial
roles of connecting gene regulatory processes with the phenotypic complexity of eukaryotes. Despite the appar-
ent biological signiﬁcance and extensive experimental efforts, our understanding of the mechanisms which link
protein-RNA phase separation with the transcriptional and catalytic processes is still lacking. The fundamental
challenges stem from (i) The molecular heterogeneity and conformational ﬂexibility of RNA and proteins, which
contain low complexity disordered regions (ii) The juxtaposition of molecular and cellular scales (iii) Presence of
non-equilibrium effects due to biochemical reactions, ATP driven processes, and irreversible bio-polymer ﬂuxes.
The current theoretical and computational paradigms often lack optimal spatio-temporal resolution and the right
combination of physical insights for confronting the complex experimental data in a comprehensive and integrative
manner. Here, I propose using multi-scale computational tools developed in our lab combined in conjunction with
data-driven approaches for revealing general mechanistic principles of protein-RNA phase separation and its link
with the functional regulatory processes. The proposal consists of three directions. In the ﬁrst direction, we focus
on hierarchical coarse-graining of proteins and RNA for studying thermodynamic driving forces of liquid-liquid
phase separation in in vitro via molecular dynamics techniques. In the second direction, we employ ﬁnite-element
and reaction-diffusion simulations trained by molecular models and experimental data for studying the connec-
tion of liquid-liquid phase separation with transcriptional and catalytic reactions, which is characteristic of in vivo
conditions. In the third direction, we assess the impact of protein-RNA phase separation generic gene regulatory
networks by using stochastic dynamics simulations. The speciﬁc systems chosen for the study are experimen-
tally well-characterized RNA binding proteins FUS, TDP-43, Tau, hnrpa1, and hnrpa2. These systems are known
for forming liquid protein-RNA condensates under usually regulated conditions and aggregated structures when
misregulated, thereby leading to major neurodegenerative diseases.
 The completion of the proposed research program will elucidate the nature of the protein-RNA phase sepa-
ration its link with functional biochemical reactions and provide much-needed insights for developing intervention
strategies for halting protein aggregation into diseases inducing cellular bodies."
10912737,"The islet of Langerhans plays a key role in glucose homeostasis through regulated hormone secretion. Islet research has focused on the insulin-secreting β-cells, even though aberrant secretion of another islet hormone, glucagon from α-cells, exacerbates the pathology of diabetes. Normalization of glucagon action by glucagon receptor antagonism can help diabetic patients maintain euglycemia and avoid hypoglycemic episodes, but progress on this approach has been slowed by numerous side-effects. An alternate approach would be to reduce glucagon secretion, but the mechanism controlling its exocytosis remains controversial. Recent data from our lab and others suggest that the long-standing focus on α-cell Ca2+ signaling may have been misleading, and that regulation of glucagon secretion requires signaling through multiple pathways. This complexity drives an innovative research strategy where we integrate data from mechanistic experiments focused on individual components, while also testing for possible cross-talk between pathways. The loss of glucose-regulation of glucagon secretion (GRGS) in vivo after β-cells are destroyed in Type I diabetes suggests that interactions between islet cell types are critical to α-cell function. This has led to models of
paracrine signaling where secreted factors from islet β- and δ-cells constrain α-cell function. We have shown that insulin and somatostatin work in concert to reduce cAMP and PKA activity, which lowers glucagon secretion, but does not by itself explain GRGS. Preliminary data point to a key role for complexin 2 in linking PKA activity to secretion. We have also shown that a novel juxtacrine pathway, EphA4/7 forward signaling, is activated by ephrinA5 ligands on the β-cell surface. This effect leads to F-actin polymerization and decreased glucagon secretion, putatively via RhoA activation, and it appears to have a glucose-regulated component. Thus, both paracrine and juxtracrine pathways drive GRGS from islets, but dispersed α-cells treated with ephrinA5 also exhibit an additional GRGS mechanism, which appears to be intrinsic to the α-cell. Based on these data, we hypothesize that GRGS requires a synergistic combination of paracrine, juxtacrine, and cell-intrinsic signaling pathways. This hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: 1) Determine the role of paracrine-mediated PKA-activated phosphorylation of complexin 2 in insulin- and somatostatin-mediated inhibition of glucagon secretion; 2) Determine the role of RhoA activation in the juxtacrine EphA4/7 forward
signaling that leads to inhibition of glucagon secretion; 3) Determine the role of EphA4/7 forward signaling in intrinsic α-cell response to glucose. The multiple intracellular and intercellular signaling mechanisms that we are uncovering will be elucidated by methods that allow precise observation of the pertinent dynamics in living cells and islets. The research plan will also leverage our findings that the mechanisms of GRGS are similar in mouse and human α-cells, and we will perform parallel experiments across species to the extent possible. These experiments will further our understanding of α-cell function, which is a critical step towards discovering new potential targets for the regulation of glucagon and treatment of diabetes."

IRACDA at Stony Brook University: The New York Consortium for the Advancement of Postdoctoral
Scholars – Phase III
 The IRACDA at Stony Brook University: New York Consortium for the Advancement of Postdoctoral
Scholars (NY-CAPS) program is a partnership among five higher education institutions in New York to address
the national need for greater diversity among tenure-track faculty in the biomedical sciences. Our postdoctoral
scholars experience comprehensive and balanced training in research, teaching and professional development
to pursue highly productive academic careers as scientist and teachers. Our innovative, blended training model
exploits over 20+ years of collaborations between a research-intensive institution (Stony Brook University, SBU),
a comprehensive institution (The City University of New York Brooklyn College), a primarily undergraduate
institution (The State University of New York Old Westbury), a technical institution (Farmingdale State College)
and a community college (Suffolk County Community College). The considerable strengths of each institution
are leveraged to provide mentored research and pedagogic training and exposure to a diverse range of higher
education institutions at which scholars may ultimately pursue academic careers. NY-CAPS is responsible for
doubling (7.6% to 15%) the racial/ethnic diversity of the domestic postdoctoral population at SBU, and 65% of
former NY-CAPS Scholars currently hold a tenured or tenure-track faculty position compared to 22% of
postdoctoral trainees who did not participate in our program. The impact on URM scholars is even more dramatic.
 NY-CAPS supports Scholars for three years and provides rigorous research and pedagogy training,
seminar series on resilience, wellness and fostering inclusive research environments, training in science
communication, professional skills training and mentoring workshops for Scholars and research mentors. The
program will be led by a team that combines a highly accomplished national leader in biomedical research and
recipient of the Presidential Award for Promoting Diversity and Academic Excellence, an accomplished
biomedical scientist with extensive experience in curriculum development, and a nationally recognized leader in
STEM diversity. The program will take advantage of mentoring teams composed of research, professional and
teaching mentors as well as a program alumna. These teams will monitor the progress of scholars and provide
guidance and feedback. NY-CAPS expects to fund four Scholars per year. Owing to strong institutional support,
two additional Scholars will be appointed to our Associates Program annually and be able to take advantage of
the NY-CAPS career development opportunities."
10912824,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In Uganda, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are disproportionately affected by HIV and have
poor viral suppression rates, increasing their risk of onward transmission. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a
major barrier to mitigating the impact of HIV among AGYW. AGYW living with HIV (AGYWLHIV) in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) who have experienced IPV have worse medication adherence, viral suppression, and
care engagement than those without IPV. Further, male partner alcohol use directly and indirectly increases
IPV risk among AGYW in SSA. Thus, an intervention with components that address heavy alcohol use
among male partners could decrease AGYW’s IPV risk, especially in Uganda, which has the highest alcohol
use per capita in SSA. Couples- based interventions have effectively reduced male partner alcohol use,
relationship conflict IPV, and improved viral suppression and HIV care engagement; yet, none have been
tailored to AGYWLHIV in SSA. We propose to develop and pilot a couples-based intervention that focuses
on improving HIV care engagement and ART adherence among AGYWLHIV by reducing heavy alcohol use
among male partners and couple IPV risk. Additionally, we will explore the intervention’s effects on AGYW
viral load for the additional key benefit of treatment as prevention. Our aims are to: 1) Adapt the behavioral
components of a brief MI-based alcohol intervention to create the proposed Kisoboka Mukwano (“It is
possible, my love!”) intervention. The intervention will promote strategies for reductions in male partner
alcohol use, coping with relationship conflict and stress, changing norms that reduce IPV and support
engagement in HIV care and ART adherence among AGYWLHIV, and, thereby, enhance future sustained
viral suppression and benefits of treatment as prevention. The intervention will be adapted and tailored to be
delivered with heterosexual couples, involve peer navigators, address IPV, and be developmentally
appropriate for AGYWLHIV in Uganda. We will develop and refine the intervention in collaboration with an
intervention steering committee through: qualitative research with married/cohabiting AGYWLHIV,
married/cohabiting men, and key informants and an initial pilot test with 6 couples. 2) We will assess safety,
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary estimates of the potential for the intervention, as compared to the
control group, to improve HIV, alcohol, and IPV outcomes. We will examine preliminary effects on AGYW
HIV care engagement, AGYW ART adherence, heavy alcohol use among male partners, and couple IPV
risk and explore effects on AGYW viral load as well as intermediate outcomes related to intervention
components. We will assess these outcomes at baseline and then at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Study
findings will be used to guide a subsequent R01 proposal to test the intervention in a larger clinical trial."

Advances in in vivo biomedical imaging are critical for revolutionizing the ability of researchers
and clinicians to peer inside the living body. These advances often catalyze major steps forward
in our understanding of biomolecular and physiological processes. At present, the power of
fluorescence imaging for deep tissue biomedical imaging is limited by the relative opacity of
biological tissues and fluids at visible to short near-infrared wavelengths < 1,000 nm. The NIR-II
tissue transparency window (1,000 to 1,700 nm) presents the opportunity to achieve molecular
fluorescence imaging at centimeter-scale depths, for monitoring biomolecular processes at high
spatial resolutions and in real time. To fully realize the transformative potential of NIR-II
fluorescence deep tissue imaging, we must develop fluorophores that overcome major challenges
of existing organic dyes and nanoparticles with NIR-II emission, such as low brightness, large
size, low solubility, and toxicity. This proposed research program pioneers a new approach to
develop small, bright, tunable, and biocompatible NIR-II emitters for targeted molecular imaging
in vivo. We will exploit a novel class of NIR-emissive DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (AgN-
DNAs) with 1-3 nm sizes, high-quantum yield emission, tunable fluorescence colors, and
compatibility with nucleic acid chemistries. Recent experiments have uncovered the first AgN-
DNAs with NIR-II emission and support the promise of creating a palette of these nanoclusters
that emit throughout the NIR-II spectral region. Using high-throughput experimental screening
and machine learning approaches, we will develop a set of bright, stable, and NIR-II emitting AgN-
DNAs that are well-suited for in vivo imaging. In tandem, we will develop chemical strategies to
transform these nanoclusters into biolabels for targeted molecular imaging by conjugating AgN-
DNAs to aptamers, peptides, antibodies, and other biomolecules of interest. These hybrid
biolabels will enable targeted staining and NIR-II fluorescence imaging of tumors, organs, and
other targets. The utility of the new NIR-II biolabels for fluorescence imaging will be assessed in
tissue models and then tested in vivo in mouse models for vascular imaging and for tracking novel
breast cancer therapeutics. We envision that these new fluorescent probes will enable a new era
of deep tissue fluorescence imaging, with a versatile range of applications from cancer research
and therapeutics development to microvascular imaging."
10910697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organismal aging and age-associated diseases, including many cancers, are driven by the slow
accumulation of damage in cells and tissues over time. In some instances, accumulation of deleterious
mutations increases genomic instability in dividing cells and disrupts the proliferation and regenerative
capacity of adult stem cells that maintain tissue function. Repeated injuries can also stimulate wound-
induced inflammation that accelerates aging across an entire organism. Interventions that increase
regenerative capacity of injured and aging tissues have the potential to improve quality of live and
disease outcomes. However, they require an ability to both detect and rejuvenate aging tissues without
increasing risk of disease. While researchers have discovered genes and signaling pathways that can
expand life span in short-lived organisms like mice, flies, nematodes, and yeast, there are relatively few
studies of anti-aging mechanisms in regenerative organisms with resistance to age-associated disease.
This proposal exploits a highly regenerative flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea, to address this gap.
Asexual S. mediterranea undergo indefinite repeated cycles of clonal expansion through asexual
reproduction and whole-body regeneration, but do not outwardly appear to suffer from age-associated
tissue degradation. We have discovered that planarian tissues do accumulate age-associated damage
during growth, but this damage does not result in stem cell exhaustion or a decline in regenerative
capacity across clonal generations. Therefore, the central goals of this proposal are to (1) determine
how age-associated damage manifests in asexual planaria throughout the animal lifecycle and (2)
Identify the cell types and signaling pathways that regulate cellular aging, detection of aged tissues,
and tissue rejuvenation. We will use a combination of well-established assays for conserved aging
hallmarks, unbiased genomics and transcriptomics methods, and RNAi gene depletion studies to
achieve these goals. Together, our proposed work will produce the most complete functional
characterization age-associated signaling in asexual S. mediterranea to date and rigorously establish
planaria as a tractable discovery model for anti-aging research. By expanding our understanding of
adaptations for anti-aging and whole-organism rejuvenation in planaria, we can build a foundation of
knowledge that will ultimately improve anti-cancer and anti-aging therapies in humans."
10912459,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria can grow and divide in a remarkably wide range of quickly changing environments, adapting to harsh
conditions by sensing external stressors and applying that information to mount an appropriate response. Stress-
sensing processes are relevant to human health: pathogenic bacteria with activated stress responses are less
susceptible to many antimicrobial treatments, and nearly 100,000 Americans die each year from infections with
drug-resistant bacteria. Indeed, environmental antibiotics are one stressor (among many) to which bacterial cells
readily respond. A persistent challenge has been that, although the molecular components of the environmental
stress response system are well known, little has been discovered about the dynamics of these stress responses
over time, particularly in individual cells. The PI has combined bacterial genetics with microfluidic technology to
directly observe the responses of single-cell lineages under tightly controlled environmental stress conditions,
revealing that the stress-response system is capable of eliciting several distinct responses with different
dynamics that depend on which stress sensors are present in the cell. These results raise additional fundamental
questions. How do stress-sensing proteins located in the cytoplasm effectively respond to the onset of stressors
that are outside the cell? Which molecular features of stress-response proteins specify the stressors they
respond to and the dynamic response patterns they instigate? How do different dynamic stress-response
patterns contribute to cellular fitness and survival in adverse conditions? The proposed studies tackle these
questions by taking advantage of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis as a highly tractable model for environmental
stress. By bringing together classical bacterial genetics, molecular techniques, fluorescence microscopy, and
microfluidic technology, these studies will yield a new and more mechanistic understanding of the principles that
govern how bacterial cells sense environmental stress, process those sensory inputs, and produce an effective
response. The results will have broad implications for understanding the general features of stress responses
across many biological systems. They will also furnish knowledge that will be useful for devising antimicrobial
treatment strategies that interfere with environmental stress sensing."

progression are not known. We will examine the connectivity of the locus coeruleus (LC), which projects to
most areas of the brain, and is one of the regions to show pathology earliest in AD. We will characterize the
populations of these neurons based on their connectivity and sensitivity to degeneration with aging and in AD
model mice, both from a global connectome level and with single-cell approaches for molecular signatures.
Additionally, we with look in more detail at the entorhinal cortex, one of the recipients of LC connections with

Volatile organic compound (VOC) exposure increases the risk for a variety of adverse health outcomes, including
cardiometabolic disease (CMD). VOC management, including remediation, is thus necessary to mitigate
exposure and thereby adverse health outcomes. Within the University of Louisville Superfund Research Center’s
overall mission, the primary goal of Project 4 is to develop and demonstrate novel, material-driven processes for
new VOC treatment strategies and technologies to meet the challenge of the complicated nature of VOC occurrence
and exposure. Towards this goal, Project 4 aims to achieve broad-based VOC treatment capacities, in both the gas and liquid
phases, with high efficiencies, flexible operation, low energy inputs, no chemical additives, and no harmful products.
We propose an innovative, three-pronged (as Project Aims) project structure, focused on materials that are
capable of harnessing various irradiation energies (e.g. solar irradiation, microwaves) for broad VOC treatment.
Specifically, three integrated Project Aims are designed to: 1) Develop and demonstrate a unique class of
hyperthermic nanomaterials, defined by their capacity to emit (localized, surface-based) heat when subjected to
microwaves, effectively acting as energy ‘antennas’, to generate extreme, surface localized heat gradients for
thermal treatment of VOCs; 2) Develop and demonstrate metal/oxide hybrid materials to achieve synergistic
photothermocatalytic effects for oxidative VOC degradation at significantly reduced temperatures (even room
temperature) compared with conventional thermocatalytic oxidation; and 3) Develop and demonstrate 3D,
crumpled graphene oxide (CGO) composites as a material platform for improving performance, and in some
cases underpinning novel (re)design strategies, for membrane-based (flow-through), photo-enhanced VOC
treatment. Project 4 is integrated into the larger Center effort(s) through training, shared and coordinated
(advance) analytical techniques, advanced data analyses, and critical data sharing regarding VOC composition
and concentrations, as a function of source(s), relating to the mission of the Center. Upon the successful
completion of the Project, newly developed materials, technologies, and processes as well as fundamental
insights will directly advance VOC treatment paradigms, leading to better VOC exposure management strategies
and thus potential health benefits."

The primary objective of the Sample and Data Management Core (DMAC) is to provide statistical support and
data management and storage capabilities to all components of the University of Louisville Superfund Research
Center (ULSRC). The functions of the Core are matched to the needs of each project and cover a full range of
services from collaboration and routine service to protocol preparation to procedural review and oversight. The
Core will provide two main services: it will establish a repository for the long-term storage and archiving of data;
and it will assist Center investigators in the statistical analysis of their results. The core will assure the authenticity
and quality of these specimens and it will prepare these samples for long-term storage, or dispense samples as
needed. The Core will also provide scientifically valid and rigorous statistical analysis of data and support the
development of innovative methods to enhance the basic and translational research efforts of Center
investigators. It will provide state-of-the-art biostatistics and bioinformatics expertise and analytical support. Core
biostatisticians will also develop new statistical methods, such as quantitative risk assessment models,
multipollutant exposure analysis, and land-use regression models, for estimating cardiometabolic disease risk in
exposed populations and for the analysis and evaluation of exposures and health effects. In collaboration with
other projects and cores, DMAC, statisticians will harmonize the data by defining standards (e.g., creating
searchable data dictionaries and defining variables relevant for each project. In the next funding cycle, we will
continue to use these procedures. The core will serve as a unique educational resource for training graduate
students, post-doctoral fellows, residents and junior faculty and in collaboration with the Training and
Administration Cores. This Core will allow Center investigators easy access to high quality, centralized data
management and statistical services, and thereby will strengthen the organizational cohesion of the Center. This
comprehensive and integrated service permits one or more biostatisticians to be involved from the initial planning
stage of a project (when statistical consultation is most beneficial) throughout its implementation, analysis and
completion. The Core will provide a stable and collegial environment that fosters long-term working relationships
between biostatisticians and investigators, and continues to promote sophisticated approaches to experimental
design and analysis. The biostatisticians of this Core are knowledgeable about clinical research and have broad
expertise in statistical applications for epidemiological investigations, clinical trials, pre-clinical studies, and
prevention and control research. Their interdisciplinary interactions with basic scientists and clinical investigators
will add a new dimension to the interpretation of experimental results, one that is only possible when collaborators
share a mutual appreciation of problems and issues."
10914095,"PROJECT SUMMARY (METABOLISM AND TOXICITY CORE)
The overall purpose and the function of the Metabolism and Toxicity Core is to provide high quality analytical
services and validated data in support of all projects at the University of Louisville Superfund Research Center.
The Core personnel will conduct measurements and assays of biomarkers and indices of cardiovascular,
metabolism, and hepatic function used for assessing the risk and progression of cardiometabolic disease upon
exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The Core personnel will also provide intellectual input and
advice in selection of specific methodological approaches and provide training to students, fellows, technicians,
and junior faculty. The Core will employ strict quality control procedures to validate data and generate
harmonized data reports and data dictionaries to be stored in the Data Management and Analysis Core. The
core will support all Superfund Center research projects through its state-of-the-art equipment and assay. The
support offered by the core encompasses three main components – a flow cytometry component for the detection
and characterization of circulating cells and microparticles; a metabolism component for measuring biochemical
and metabolic endpoints such as urinary metabolites of VOCs, bile acids and catecholamines by LC/MS/MS and
GC/MS; and a pathology component to assay systemic toxicity using a battery of tests relating to glucose control,
liver function and hepatic toxicity. However, the scope of the core exceeds that of the projects to encompass
the development of cutting-edge techniques and analytical platforms to expand its repertoire of services. The
Core will continually upgrade its infrastructure as well as its technical capabilities to remain at the leading edge
of assays relating to biomarkers of exposure and harm. The core is also committed to the continued education
of its users as well as the research community at the university. The Core will also disseminate educational
information regarding the potential utility and accessibility of its services to enhance environmental health
research. By ensuring central deposition of harmonized and validated data, the core will provide a firm foundation
for research not only by the University of Louisville Superfund investigators, but investigators at other Superfund

technical personnel, the Core will provide premier toxicological and clinical pathology services. By meeting these
goals, the core will continue to be an essential vehicle for growth and innovation within the Center, as well as an

10914135,"Core 2 Project Summary/Abstract
The purpose of this core is to provide a centralized laboratory resource for obtaining, cryopreserving and
distributing patient samples and to monitor the kinetics of immune reconstitution following allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) and following immune interventions to prevent or treat chronic
GVHD. Prior to transplantation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), bone marrow and serum or plasma
are obtained from all patients enrolled on clinical trials supported by this Program Project. PBMC, plasma and
serum are also obtained from patients undergoing routine allogenic stem cell transplantation and normal stem
cell donors for these individuals. Following HCT, peripheral blood, plasma and DNA samples are obtained at
regular intervals. All of these samples are processed, cryopreserved, entered into a computerized inventory and
made available to all of the investigators in this program. The HCT tissue bank inventory also has a very large
number of serial samples from patients who have previously undergone allogeneic HCT at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital. Clinical outcome data on these
patients is available in our HCT database. This inventory of annotated samples is also available to Program
investigators. Finally, the tissue bank inventory includes serial samples obtained from previous clinical trials
evaluating low dose IL-2 and other novel therapeutic agents in patients with chronic graft versus host disease
(cGVHD). All banked samples have been collected from patients who have provided informed consent for sample
collection for research studies. To monitor immune reconstitution after allogeneic HCT as well as interventions
to prevent or treat GVHD, this core utilizes multi-parameter flow cytometry with a panel of fluorochrome-
conjugated monoclonal antibodies or mass cytometry with panels of metal-conjugated antibodies. If needed,
plasma concentrations of cytokines known to play important roles in immune reconstitution are measured by
ELISA or panels of cytokines can be measured by Luminex. Reconstitution of T cell immunity to specific target
antigens such as CMV and EBV is determined by ELISPOT and HLA-tetramers. Results of each of these assays
are correlated with other parameters of immune function as well as with clinical outcomes."
10914137,"Project Summary
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a long-established therapy for blood malignancies. The
therapeutic benefit and potential cure achieved by HCT is mediated by the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect that is
derived from donor immune system. However, the full recognition of the GVL effect has been hampered by
disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The overarching objective of the research projects in
this application is to better understand the complex pathophysiology of chronic GVHD, the mechanisms leading
to fibrosis and lung injury, and to develop therapeutics targeting the major pathways leading to the common
clinical manifestations of chronic GVHD. More specifically, Project 1 will identify immune networks that
characterize patients who will develop cGVHD and interrogate mechanisms of response to various treatments
for chronic GVHD; Project 2 will be dedicated to develop into bronchiolitis obliterans and lung fibrosis to identify
new therapeutic agents to treat lung chronic GVHD; and Project 3 will perform a phase II clinical trial of a ROCK2
inhibitor to treat lung cGVHD, identify the cellular target of immunologic attack in bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome (BOS) using lung organoids, and identify the antigenic determinants of immune attack in BOS. Project
1 involves various translational studies to identify a immunologic signature for cGVHD, Project 2 involves animal
studies and Project 3 involves both a clinical trial as well as translational studies to achieve the overarching goal
of this application. The primary objective of the Biostatistics and Data Management Core (Core 3) is to provide
statistical collaboration for all investigators involved in this Program Project. This includes collaboration with
project investigators in the design of clinical trial and laboratory studies, analysis of clinical and laboratory data
and to establish correlations of clinical outcomes with laboratory results, and participate in manuscript writing in
all Projects. Core 3 will also provide centralized mechanisms to assure the timely and complete capture of all
clinical data in this Program Project. This includes collection and maintenance of necessary clinical information,
data management support, quality control for clinical data, and oversight of clinical trial operations to ensure that
all data elements required by each protocol are collected in timely fashion; and where necessary, design of
research procedures and databases to allow blinded laboratory assessments and later integration with patient-
level data for analysis."
10912176,"Powassan virus (POWV) is a neurovirulent tick-borne flavivirus (FV) emerging in the N.E. US. POWV causes
a 10% fatal encephalitis resulting in severe long-term neurologic damage in 50% of patients. The incidence of
POWV encephalitis in the elderly remains an enigma with mechanisms of POWV neuroinvasion,
neuroinflammation and senescence that contribute to pathology virtually unknown. Mice s.c. inoculated with
POWV LI9 develop lethal neurovirulent disease with overt spongiform brain damage similar to Alzheimer's
disease. Neurovirulence assessed as a function of murine age, revealed POWV LI9 to be lethal in 82% of 50
wk, and 7.8% of 10 wk old C57/Bl6 mice, and consistent with severe POWV neurovirulence in the elderly.
Concomitant with lethality brains of 50 wk old mice revealed higher viral load and cytokine response than 10
wk old mice 15 dpi in addition to microglial activation throughout the CNS, and persistent in survivors. A
passage attenuated LI9-P strain was generated which replicates like LI9 in vitro, but fails to enter the CNS or
cause lethal disease, and protects mice from WT LI9 challenge. This POWV lethal and attenuated POWV pair,
provides a means of defining neurovirulence mechanisms and determinants of POWV entry into the CNS.
 Mechanisms of POWV entry into the CNS remain to be revealed. Initial LI9 and LI9-P comparisons found
that both POWVs productively infect primary human neurovascular barrier cells: brain microvascular
endothelial cells (BMECs) and choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPEpCs). These findings rationalize POWV
entry into the CNS via BBB or BCSFB portals. In contrast to LI9, LI9-P highly induces IFNβ/λ responses in
BMECs and CPEpCs, that may inhibit POWV neuroinvasion. These findings are consistent with mutations in
Envelope and NS3/4A/4B proteins restricting LI9-P neuroinvasion and neurovirulence.
 A POWV reverse genetics system uniquely permits us to modify infectious POWVs. Using LI9/LI9-P
mutants, single cell sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and flow, studies proposed analyze POWV
neuroinvasion, CNS cell tropism and roles for CNS immunopathology and cell senescence as mechanisms of
age-dependent POWV lethality in mice. Temporal scRNAseq analysis of brains, neuroinflammatory responses
and senescent microglial and neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) will be assessed for roles in POWV directed
spongiform damage and lethality in aged versus young mice. Studies are aimed at revealing age-dependent
differences in CNS regeneration, microglial and T cell responses and POWV clearance from the CNS that
distinguish protective responses of young mice, from lethal POWV infection and long-term CNS damage in
aged mice. Studies are likely to reveal defensive CNS responses, and therapeutic approaches for resolving
viral encephalitis that are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly. Studies proposed
evaluate: 1) Mechanisms of early POWV CNS entry and neuronal depletion; 2) POWV clearance from the CNS
by microglia and T cells; and 3) Roles for CNS cell senescence in age-dependent POWV lethality, and
senolytics for preventing severe POWV disease."
10908575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite overall improvements, ethnic or racial disparities continue to increase, suggesting
deficiencies in research designs for understanding disparities. For example, compared to the
2017 US Census, most observational cancer studies were found to over represent Caucasians
and underrepresent African Americans and Asians. How to utilize these studies to detect and
understand racial disparities remains challenging.
This proposal is motivated by the Boston Lung Cancer Survival Cohort (BLCSC), one of the
largest lung cancer cohorts globally, which consists of lung cancer cases registered since 1992
at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and
has expanded to the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and Mayo Clinic. This rich database
provides a unique opportunity for studying racial disparities in cancer outcomes as well as
presents a challenge with unbalanced covariates across racial groups. We also have access to
the International Lung and Cancer Consortium (ILCCO), an international cohort established in
2004 with a data structure similar to BLCSC.
Leveraging these cancer cohorts, we develop methods with a common goal of effectively
identifying racial disparities in cancer outcomes by integrating high dimensional observational
studies with multiple racial groups. Rich datasets like BLCSC and ILLCO are ideal for integrative,
unconfounded detection of racial disparities in cancer outcomes, and for generating statistical
findings generalizable to a realistic and inclusive larger population."
10908576,"Abstract
Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is the primary hepatic hydrolase, contributing to 80-95% hydrolytic activity in the
human liver. CES1 is responsible for the metabolism of many clinically important medication, environmental
toxins, and endogenous substances. Hepatic expression and activity of CES1 vary markedly among
individuals, which is a major factor contributing to the interindividual variability in response to medications
metabolized by CES1. We have identified a loss-of-function CES1 nonsynonymous variant, G143E
(rs71647871), and demonstrated that this variant could significantly affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD) of CES1 substrate drugs. However, the G143E variant does not affect CES1
expression and only contributes to a small portion of CES1 function variability because of its low frequency.
Therefore, biomarkers capable of predicting CES1 expression are urgently needed to improve the
effectiveness and safety of numerous drugs metabolized by CES1. Our preliminary study showed that plasma
CES1 protein concentrations were predictive of CES1 in vivo function. Aim 1 of this proposal is to evaluate the
correlations between plasma CES1 protein and the PK and PD of the selective CES1 substrate enalapril using
the plasma samples collected from an ongoing enalapril PK study (NCT03051282). This enalapril PK study
was originally designed to determine the effect of the CES1 variant G143E on enalapril PK and PD in healthy
subjects. We expect that combining the plasma CES1 protein biomarker and the CES1 genetic biomarker will
explain much of the variability observed in the PK and PD of enalapril. Aim 2 is to determine the correlation
between CES1 protein plasma concentrations and hepatic CES1 protein levels in matched plasma and liver
tissues. This study will provide mechanistic evidence to support that plasma CES1 protein concentrations are
predictive of CES1 protein levels in the liver. We expect that the proposed project will establish plasma CES1
protein as a reliable biomarker for predicting the PK and PD of CES1 substrate drugs. The project is highly
impactful because many CES1 substrate drugs have narrow therapeutic indexes, and plasma CES1 protein
biomarker-guided precision dosing could significantly improve the efficacy and safety of these medications.
The project has the potential to change the paradigm of how to treat patients more effectively by using plasma
CES1 protein as a biomarker to optimize therapeutic regimens. This study will also shed light on future
research on plasma protein biomarkers for other hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled NASH and Fibrosis: From Molecular
Phenotypes to Precision Therapeutics, organized by Drs. Stefano Romeo, Michael Charlton, Silvia Sookoian
and Gregory Tesz. The conference will be held in Banff, Canada from March 3-6, 2024.
Fatty liver disease (FLD) includes a spectrum of conditions in which excess liver fat coexists with inflammation,
fibrosis and increased risk of cancer. The incidence and prevalence of FLD is increasing rapidly and affects
about one out of four people across the globe, with concurrent increases in liver related morbidity and mortality.
Moreover, despite over a decade of research, clinical trials have failed to bring effective treatments for FLD with
fibrosis. The complex and variable interactions between environmental and genetic susceptibility and protective
factors have presented challenges to progress. Assessing severity of disease and response to therapy have
been similarly challenging. Therefore, this Keystone Symposia conference program will explore the metabolic,
genetic and molecular diversity of FLD to identify novel strategies to tackle this disease. The program will
examine the latest advances in noninvasive measurements to both assess treatment efficacy as well as identify
subpopulations at risk for liver-related events and mortality. Sessions will explore novel drug targets deriving
from human genetics studies of variants protective against FLD. Ultimately, these advances will pave the way to
precision therapeutics to treat NASH, fibrosis and cancer."
10922709,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The challenge addressed by this proposal is to generate a map, the global human cell-surface interactome,
that defines in vitro interactions among the extracellular domains of human cellsurface proteins (CSPs) and
secreted proteins. This map will have a major impact on biomedical research, because cell-cell interactions
mediated by CSPs are central to human physiology, controlling almost every biological process that is affected
by disease. CSPs and secreted ligands comprise the majority of the therapeutic targets that have been
successfully developed in recent years. Knowledge of interaction partners is essential for assessing the
therapeutic potential of a CSP, since this knowledge defines the biological processes that it controls. For
example, PD-1 was identified as a negative regulator of T cell function in 1992, but its value as a target for
cancer immunotherapy only became clear much later, when its ligand PD-L1 was identified and found to be
expressed on tumor cells. We will not only generate a complete map of in vitro interactions among human
CSPs and secreted proteins, but also assess the functions of these interactions in cells of the human immune
and nervous systems. This is a huge project, because there are about 2000 human single-transmembrane
domain CSPs and 200 “orphan” secreted factors. Creation of a map of pairwise interactions among all of these
proteins requires testing 4.8 million interactions. This is beyond the capacity of current screening methods, so
execution of this screen at an academic institution will require the development of new technologies. This
project is too large to be supported by a traditional RO1, but is perfectly suited to the transformative research
award mechanism. Here we propose new ways to multiplex both in vitro biochemical screens and in vivo
functional screens, so as to make it possible to define all in vitro interactions among CSPs and secreted
ligands and to assess the functions of many of these within a 5-year funding period. To do this, we will first
multiplex and sensitize in vitro interactome screens using color-coded beads and high-avidity nanoparticles.
We will then develop methods to convert in vitro protein interaction screens into high-throughput DNA
sequencing screens, which have a huge multiplexing capacity. For the functional screens, multiplexing single-
cell analysis of cell fate perturbations can allow us to assess the effects of many different ligands on single
immune system and neural cells in a single experiment. The rationale for the overall approach described here
is that it defines a stepwise process in which we systematically develop and optimize screen technologies, then
use the technology that performs best for execution of the actual screens."

Innate immunity provides the first line of host defense in response to invading pathogens. Pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viruses and other pathogens.
RIG-I/MDA-5 are DExD/H box RNA helicases in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway that detect double
stranded RNA viral genomes and activate the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS. The DNA sensor cGAS
detects double stranded DNA and activates STING, a transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum adaptor. Both
MAVS and STING activate canonical (IKKa and IKKb), and noncanonical IKK kinases (TBK1 and IKKi) to
activate transcription factors NF-kB and IRF3 respectively. Together, IRF3 and NF-kB regulate the expression
of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory genes that coordinate the innate response and initiate the adaptive
immune response against pathogens. The NLRP3 inflammasome also plays a critical role in inflammatory
responses by triggering caspase-1-mediated pro-IL-1b cleavage to yield the biologically active form of IL-
1b that drives inflammation and adaptive immunity. NLRP3 also induces a highly lytic form of inflammatory cell
death termed pyroptosis via cleavage of gasdermin-D to form plasma membrane pores. The RLR, cGAS-
STING and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways are potent inducers of inflammation that must be tightly regulated
to avert overexuberant inflammation and tissue damage. TAX1BP1 was first identified as an anti-apoptotic
protein that interacts with the zinc finger deubiquitinase A20/TNFAIP3. Our previous work has established that
TAX1BP1 restricts cytokine-induced NF-kB activation as well as RLR-induced type I IFN production and
apoptosis. TAX1BP1 functions as a selective autophagy receptor by recruiting ubiquitinated cargo to
developing autophagosomes via two LC3 interaction regions (LIRs). However, it remains unclear how
TAX1BP1 autophagy function is regulated and if TAX1BP1 inhibits other innate immune signaling pathways. In
preliminary studies we provide experimental evidence that TAX1BP1 is phosphorylated by both noncanonical
and canonical IKK kinases which controls both basal and virus-induced TAX1BP1 autophagic degradation
respectively. Using TAX1BP1-deficient macrophages we have demonstrated that TAX1BP1 is a novel inhibitor
of both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 pathways. Furthermore, MAVS protein aggregates accumulate in TAX1BP1-
deficient cells suggesting a potential aggrephagy function in the regulation of innate immune signaling. The
central hypothesis driving the proposed investigations is that TAX1BP1 inhibits RLR, cGAS-STING and NLRP3
pathways by autophagy-mediated clearance of signaling protein aggregates. We will test this hypothesis
experimentally with the following Specific Aims: (1) determine the role of TAX1BP1 phosphorylation in its
autophagy function, (2) determine the mechanisms of TAX1BP1 inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway, and
(3) determine the mechanisms of TAX1BP1 inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway. Completion of the proposed
studies will provide new insights into innate immune regulation and immune homeostasis."
10923549,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how host metabolic adaptations during infection promote co-
operative defenses between a host and enteric pathogens to drive asymptomatic carriage and the eventual
evolution of commensalism. The proposed studies utilize a natural in vivo host-pathogen involving a enteric
bacterial pathogen that causes infectious colitis. In previous work, the Ayres lab discovered that host
micronutrient metabolic adaptations during infection with enteric pathogens, regulates host carbohydrate
metabolism leading to a phenomenon the Ayres lab calls “metabolic bribery”. This involves the allocation of
carbohydrates to the niche of the pathogen (intestine) to increase availability for the pathogen to metabolize.
The Ayres lab discovered that the metabolism of these specific carbohydrates by the pathogen suppressed
pathogen virulence and disease, indicating this micronutrient regulation of host and pathogen macronutrient
metabolism acts as an anti-virulence mechanism. In the new proposal, the Ayres lab presents exciting data
demonstrating that micronutrient metabolism coordinates interactions between host glucose and lipid
metabolism to suppress virulence and promote cooperation with enteric pathogens. The proposed studies will
investigate the mechanisms by which dietary micronutrients regulate macronutrient metabolism to suppress
pathogen virulence to yield asymptomatic carriers of the pathogen. The proposed studies will focus on
understanding how micronutrient metabolism orchestrates glucose and lipid processes in the body to suppress
pathogen virulence. The proposed studies will then examine the interplay between the adaptive immune
response and micronutrient mediated cooperative defenses, elucidating how these two systems cooperate to
mediate healthy host-pathogen interactions and protect from infectious colitis. Finally, the proposed studies will
utilize this novel host-pathogen/micronutrient system to elucidate the mechanisms that drive the evolution of
pathogen attenuation towards commensalism and persistence within the microbiota. This work will contribute
to a better understanding for gastrointestinal mucosal adaptive immunology, mechanisms of acute and chronic
gastrointestinal inflammation and colitis, the effects of gastrointestinal microbes and microbial metabolism on
gastrointestinal health and disease, including the effects of pathogenic bacterial pathogens."
10917618,"The microbiome has emerged as a functional microbial organ system that plays a key role in
human health and disease including obesity, cancer, and inflammation. Dietary and host factors
broadly regulate the composition and function of the microbiome and are associated with health
outcome, but the tools available to profile this organ system in humans are limited. Despite
advances in sequencing technologies that infer microbial metabolic function, there remains a
significant unmet need for the direct characterization of functional metabolic pathways within the
microbiome that play a pivotal role in human health and disease. This proposal application aims
to use activity-based probes in the study of the microbiome. This novel approach allows for direct
measurement of protein function, bypassing the reliance on downstream metabolites as indirect
indicators of microbial activity. By focusing on functionally active enzymes and linking them to
specific taxa, the study will achieve a level of molecular resolution and specificity not previously
attainable, thus revolutionizing our understanding of the microbiome's functional role. We will
further leverage this technology to enrich for microbial consortia or isolate specific taxa with
functional capabilities that will be translated to pre-clinical and clinical studies to complete the
pipeline of precision microbial therapeutics. Successful execution of this research will have a
profound impact on scientific understanding of the microbiome's contribution to human health and
disease, specifically highlighting the impact of diet and intestinal inflammation. By uncovering the
specific microbial metabolic pathways associated with clinical response and treatment efficacy,
the study opens up new avenues to develop targeted therapies to modulate the microbiome,
enhancing treatment outcomes for patients. This technology has the potential to revolutionize how
we investigate microbial function, emphasizing the microbiome's function and resultant activities
due to disease, thus paving the way for personalized therapies and interventions targeting specific
microbial metabolic pathways."

Pathogenic variants in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway genes are prevalent in a subset of men with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and occur in both the somatic and germline
genomes. These abnormalities, primarily insertions and deletions resulting in protein truncations, occur in 10–
20% of patients with mCRPC. These variants also occur in lower-grade localized prostate cancers, although
the prevalence of DDR mutations in these tumors and their impact on clinical outcome, survival, and drug
sensitivity are largely unknown. In other projects of the proposed grant, specific mutations in DDR genes will
be identified. The focus of Project 3 will be to prioritize and systematically evaluate these mutations, using a
combination of functional assays, state-of-the-art organoid technology, CRISPR-mediated gene editing, and
analysis of whole genome sequencing. In Aim 1 of Project 3, we will use multiple prostate cancer cell lines to
determine whether specific DDR gene mutations are deleterious or benign variants. We will test the hypothesis
that bona fide pathogenic DDR alleles are associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and will
correlate with specific functional DNA repair defects and drug responses. In Aim 2, we will use gene editing to
introduce DDR mutations into the endogenous genetic locus of multiple prostate cancer cell lines to provide a
more physiologic assessment of the specific mutations. In Aim 3, we will analyze the whole-genome
sequences from prostate cancers to identify precise mutational signatures which may result from loss-of-
function mutations in specific DDR genes. Project 3 will have extensive collaborations with the investigators in
Projects 1 and 2 and the Genomics Core as outlined in the attached research plan."

of patients with CF-related diabetes. The primary objective of the Cystic Fibrosis Bioinformatics and
Biostatistics Core (CF-BBC) is to provide expert-level bioinformatics and biostatistical support and training.
State-of-the-art bioinformatics and biostatistics have become essential in biomedical research in general, and
CF research in particular, because of increasingly complex experimental designs and the large data sets that
arise from genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and related high-dimension techniques. We have found that CF
researchers trained in bioinformatics and biostatistics are better positioned to analyze their own data than staff
at generic data analysis Core facilities, and that CF researchers share what they’ve learned with others in their
field. Therefore, investing in bioinformatics and biostatistics training is an effective and efficient response to
rapidly increasing amounts of CF related scientific data. We have successfully trained four CF scientists who
are now participating as instructors in our educational programs, and dozens more who report that they are
sharing their training in bioinformatics and biostatistics with CF researchers on an informal basis. Importantly,
we host two intensive courses to provide training in the technical and statistical foundations of applied
bioinformatics, and our instructional system includes weekly meetings (R Club) and seminars at which students
and faculty present their experience using statistical, graphical, and informatics tools. These weekly meetings
are designed in part by participants from the CF research community, keeping our educational agenda in sync
with evolving research needs. Our model of providing bioinformatics support is also innovative because CF-
BBC bioinformatics and biostatistics specialists are trained CF researchers. This greatly improves
communication and makes the Core more valuable in areas like experimental design, understanding biological
meaning of results, suggesting follow up experiments, writing manuscripts and dealing with reviewer
comments. Finally, the CF-BBC is innovative in its commitment to Open Science. Our Core helps the DartCF
community format and annotate data, and deposit it in appropriate databases, making our data more findable,
accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) by others. We also help DartCF researchers find, download and
reanalyze public data sets relevant to their research, allowing them to generate new hypotheses and ensure

laboratory-friendly organisms such as bacteria or yeast. This approach is expected to make
countless new polyethers accessible for drug research. In order to create a robust and reliable
polyether bioproduction platform, we must first achieve a detailed and comprehensive
understanding of how polyethers are produced in living organisms. More than 100 different
polyether natural products have been discovered so far, and examination of known polyether
biosynthetic gene clusters show that all polyethers are generated via a common three-stage
biosynthetic scheme. Stage 1: construction of the polyketide backbone by modular polyketide
synthases. Stage 2: stereoselective epoxidation of the polyene intermediate by a monooxygenase.
Stage 3: formation of the hallmark cyclic ether groups by one or more epoxide hydrolases. The
universal nature of this scheme ensures that investigation of any one particular polyether
biosynthesis pathway and its associated enzymes will lead to a general understanding of how
nature generates polyethers. In this project, we will study the biosynthetic enzymes from the
lasalocid A biosynthesis pathway from Streptomyces lasaliensis. Lasalocid A biosynthesis
pathway is an excellent model system for studying how nature produces polyethers because it
consists of just nine enzymes, yet it possesses all the hallmark chemical transformations of
polyether biosynthesis."

This five-year proposal will provide a platform for Dr. Goodyer’s successful transition to an independent
physician scientist investigating novel mechanisms for the prevention and treatment of cardiac rhythm
disorders. Specific mentorship and training opportunities have been tailored to build on the foundation of the
applicant. Dr. Goodyer will be mentored by Dr. Sean M. Wu, Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics
and Dr. Anne Dubin, Professor of Pediatrics, Section Chief of Pediatric Electrophysiology (EP). Additionally, an
outstanding advisory team of internationally-renowned scientists has been selected, each advisor with unique
experiences and skillsets in fields ranging from basic science EP to translational medicine. Dr. Goodyer’s
training plan lays out a personalized program for developing his proficiency in the following key areas: 1. Use
of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to functionally evaluate novel cardiac conduction system
(CCS) genes; 2. Small animal phenotyping skills for in vivo analyses of CCS development and function; 3.
Knowledge and techniques in basic science EP; and, 4. Professional development including leadership, grant
writing and science communication skills. The training plan includes experiences from Stanford courses on
stem cell research (eg. STEMREM 201B: Stem Cells and Human Development), weekly seminars on
cardiology and translational medicine, renowned workshops on leadership and communication as well as a
tailored externship focused on advanced basic science EP techniques in the lab of advisor Dr. Chiamvimonvat,
Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at University of California Davis. These mentorship and training activities
are tailored to enable the candidate to achieve specific research goals aimed at the elucidation of CCS
development and function. In Aim 1, Dr. Goodyer will investigate the role of a novel, intracellular, CCS-specific
gene Cpne5 (copine 5), uncovered in his recently published work in Circulation Research and associated
with human heart rate variation by independent genome wide association studies. The applicant will evaluate
the function of Cpne5 in conduction cells by performing in vitro loss- and gain-of-function assays using both
isolated mouse and hiPSC-derived CCS cells. In Aim 2, the candidate will further investigate Cpne5 in the
context of CCS development and disease in vivo by comprehensive cardiac and electrophysiological
phenotyping of CRISPR-Cas9 generated Cpne5 systemic knockout mice. Finally, Aim 3 capitalizes on the
applicant’s recent discovery of another previously unknown CCS-specific marker. Specifically, by targeting this
cell surface marker the applicant will validate the use of a novel antibody-based optical imaging method for
visualizing the CCS in human hearts ex vivo. These studies will provide a proof-of-principle for the in vivo
labeling of cardiac substructures and lay the foundation for translational opportunities in the real-time
visualization of the CCS during cardiac interventions to prevent accidental intraoperative damage to the CCS."

Cells probe their biophysical environment by engaging multiple ligands on the extracellular matrix and in solution
resulting in receptor oligomerization and clustering at the nanoscale. In the fields of biomaterials science and
nanomedicine, there is a significant need to recreate these complex dynamics by presenting ligands from a
synthetic substrate with optimal presentation. However, it is very challenging to develop sufficient design criteria
at this nano-bio interface due in part to the complexity of the interactions as well as our insufficient ability to
precisely control these macromolecular features. We seek to address this fundamental limitation by developing
quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that will allow us to accurately shape synthetic
multivalent ligands with optimized biophysical dynamics for programmable cell signaling. Our approach
significantly leverages a new combinatorial platform developed by the PI to precisely fine tune and study these
challenging interactions. To do this, our research program has five major thrusts. Thrust 1: Leveraging our
automated platform for multivalent ligand synthesis, we will study the spectrum of available hydrodynamic
characteristics and learn how to control their structure with high precision. Thrust 2: We will use molecular
dynamic (MD) simulations to help us define these macromolecular features then build QSAR models to extract
design criteria. Thrust 3: Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and super-resolution microscopy, we will
probe ligand-receptor interactions and characterize the macromolecular contributions towards avidity, specificity,
cooperativity and super-selectivity. Thrust 4: The implications of these features on cell signaling and ligand
directed cell behavior will be characterized. Thrust 5: We will apply this new knowledge to a variety of
applications including regenerative medicine, nanomedicine and as probes to study signal transduction. These
five major thrusts were developed to complement each other towards our long-term goals for developing highly
bioactive and customizable ligands for programed cell behavior."
10914055,"ABSTRACT
There are currently no medicinal interventions demonstrated to consistently improve the low survival rate
and high incidence of organ injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Among those who initially
survive OHCA, death from arrest-related injury to organs remains frustratingly high, and other-organ injuries
are common and often debilitating among OHCA arrest patients who survive to discharge.[1] While cerebral
injury is the most lethal[2] and most prevalent organ injury, acute kidney injury (AKI) is also common and is
associated with mortality and adverse outcomes such as the need for dialysis[3,4]. Our group is currently
engaged in a randomized trial to test if thiamine (vitamin B1) protects the brain after cardiac arrest by
improving aerobic metabolism reflected in the reduction of lactic acidosis. However, ongoing research
conducted by our group and others has raised new and equally important questions. With this K-24 proposal,
we plan to address two of these questions by adding new sub-studies to this trial. The first sub-study tests
the hypothesis that thiamine protects not just the brain but also the kidney after cardiac arrest, while
the second sub-study tests the hypothesis that cardiac arrest patients have abnormally low pools of
a-lipoic acid (LA), another critical mediator of aerobic metabolism, which may place a cap on the
efficacy of thiamine therapy. The rationale for the first sub-study is based on recent evidence linking
decreased aerobic metabolism in the kidney to renal failure in critical illnesses,[5,6] the stimulatory effect of
thiamine on aerobic metabolism, and our randomized trial in sepsis showing that thiamine protected kidney
function.[7] The second sub-study is based on our preliminary data suggesting that thiamine may not fully
restore cellular oxygen consumption after cardiac arrest. Because aerobic glucose metabolism requires both
lipoic acid and thiamine as cofactors for two key enzymes, even subacute lipoic acid deficiencies may place
a cap on the efficacy of thiamine as a metabolic resuscitator. Experimental provision of LA has been shown
to protect against ischaemic brain and kidney injury; these findings contribute to the rationale for examining
LA in the context of our existing trial. Together, these studies will advance thiamine as a potential post-arrest
intervention for AKI and deepen our understanding of the relationship of other key metabolic components in
critical illness, while also providing an excellent platform to mentor future patient-oriented researchers. This
award will provide an established and highly productive clinical researcher and mentor with both project and
mentoring support and allow continued expansion of his outstanding translational research training program
in the Center for Resuscitation Science (CRS) at BIDMC. The breadth of experiments in the scientific portion
of the proposal (clinical trial design/execution and patient-based laboratory work) along with the research
infrastructure provided by multiple ongoing CRS studies will give mentees the experience and expertise to
progress towards independence as the next generation of researchers in the field of resuscitation medicine."

The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Cervical Cancer Research Lab (CCRL) is focused on
developing vaccines and novel immunotherapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-associated diseases. Dr. Shiwen Peng is a dedicated Research Specialist and essential
member of the CCRL. Dr. Peng has a strong background in immunology, cancer biology, and translational
research, with extensive training and experience in vaccine development and HPV-associated cancer
immunotherapy. Since he first joined the CCRL as a Research Associated in 2003, Dr. Peng has made numerous
contributions towards developing innovative immunotherapies for the prevention and treatment of HPV-
associated diseases. Notably, Dr. Peng was the first to develop a DNA vaccine targeting the HPV16 E6 protein
and has also collaborated with other lab members and investigators to identify multiple novel strategies to
enhance efficacy of immunotherapies, including the delivery of our DNA vaccine via gene gun. This proposal is
designed to support Dr. Shiwen Peng’s role on several CCRL research programs, including the development of
novel preclinical tumor models of HPV-associated cervical and oropharyngeal cancers, development of human
immunological assays intended for translation to human clinical trials, and generation of relevant preclinical data
to serve as foundation for further clinical translation. To achieve this goal, Dr. Peng will test immunotherapies for
HPV-associated diseases in novel preclinical tumor models to improve cancer immunotherapy for patients and
spearhead efforts to develop human immunological assays employed in clinical trials involving HPV-associated
cancer patients. To date, Dr. Peng has successfully developed new vaccine candidates, vaccination strategies,
and new immunological assays for the evaluation of vaccines in vivo. Dr. Peng has worked closely with Dr. Wu
as a co-investigator on the Cervical Cancer SPORE since its inception in 2004. His continued involvement in the
CCRL and collaborations with other investigators has allowed him to develop innovative technologies that have
contributed to the success of the CCRL. Dr. Peng has the innate ability to design and perform experiments,
collaborate with a number of investigators, and intellectually contribute to several grant applications and peer-
reviewed publications. He will participate and present in several conferences in order to introduce innovative ideas
to the CCRL and enhance his skills, expertise, and knowledge of HPV-associated diseases."

MYC is the most commonly activated oncogene in human cancer. However, to date, no existing therapies
directly target MYC or the MYC pathway. My goal is now to target the MYC oncogene pathway to treat human
cancer. Over the last 20 years, I have gained fundamental new insights into how the MYC oncogene initiates
and maintains tumorigenesis. My work has established the idea that MYC is a hallmark of cancer and that many
cancers are “MYC oncogene addicted”. I have identified both tumor intrinsic and host-immune dependent
mechanisms. Now, I will use these insights from lab and novel methods to develop new therapies for cancer. I
was one of the first investigators to use the Tetracycline regulatory system (Tet system) to generate “conditional”
transgenic mouse models to demonstrate that MYC-induced cancer is “reversible” or “oncogene addicted”
(Felsher and Bishop, Molecular Cell, 1999). Since then, I have used the Tet system to make a library of
oncogene driven transgenic mouse models (MYC, RAS, BCR-ABL) of T-cell acute lymphoma (T-ALL), leukemia
(AML), osteosarcoma (OS), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) and renal cell
adenocarcinoma (RCC). I have used my conditional transgenic mouse model systems to not only understand
how MYC and other oncogenes initiate and maintain tumorigenesis but also develop innovative methods and
novel technologies to make seminal contributions in cancer research, exhibiting sustained productivity. My
proposed future research is built on recent observations that have used combined RNA, ChIP and metabolomic
analysis to identify that lipogenesis and CRISPR synthetic lethal screen to identify nuclear transport as examples
of otherwise not known to be MYC-regulated gene pathways that when targeted can block and reverse MYC-
driven cancer. Now, I propose to use my library of conditional transgenic mouse models and human PDX models
to generally identify targetable genes and pathways in the MYC oncogene pathway. I will use three
complimentary approaches: RNAseq, ChIPseq and DESI-MSI to identify novel vulnerabilities in MYC-driven
cancers; CRISPR in vitro and in vivo synthetic lethal screens combined with CyTOF and CODEX analysis to
identify targets in my MYC-driven tumor models and understand their mechanistic role in tumorigenesis; MYC
function reporter systems to be able to screen for genes and therapies to target MYC-driven cancers. My
proposed research program has extensive support from an interdisciplinary team of colleagues. My proposed

10914168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spliceosome mutations and alterations in RNA splicing are common in myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), yet the specific oncogenic changes due to these alterations have not been fully identified.
We demonstrated that overexpression of an active isoform of the serine/threonine kinase, IRAK4,
is seen in MDS. The active long IRAK4 isoform (IRAK4-L) consists of an N-terminal death domain
(DD) and C-terminal kinase domain (KD), which stochastically assembles with the Myddosome
complex and results in maximal activation of innate immune signaling pathways. Inclusion of exon
4 in the long isoform is mediated by mutant splicing factor (SF), U2AF1, which results in oncogenic
signaling and poor prognosis in MDS/AML (Smith et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2019). Importantly,
inhibition of IRAK4-L abrogates leukemic growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings established
that mutations in U2AF1 induce expression of therapeutically targetable ""active"" IRAK4 isoforms
and provide a genetic link to activation of chronic innate immune signaling in MDS. Our preliminary
RNA-sequencing studies in primary MDS samples reveal that (i) splicing factor SF3B1 mutations
also lead to the active IRAK4-L isoforms via retention of exon 6, and that (ii) a sizable proportion
of splicing factor (SF) wild-type MDS patients also exhibit expression of IRAK4-L. We hypothesize
that oncogenic IRAK4-L isoforms are critical for the function of SF-mutant (i.e. U2AF1 and SF3B1)
and a subset of SF-wildtype MDS disease propagating cells. As such, this proposal will
comprehensively evaluate the mechanistic basis of IRAK4-L regulation in SF3B1 and SF-wild
type MDS (Aim 1) by using isogenic cell lines expressing the SF3B1 K700E mutants and by
altering the expression of splicing modulator PRMT5. Aim 2 will determine downstream regulators
of oncogenic IRAK4 isoform activation in MDS. In addition to examination of NF-κB/MAPK
signaling, we will perform an unbiased phospho-proteomic screen to identify direct substrates of
IRAK4-L and examine their roles in hematopoietic dysfunction. Aim 3 will determine the efficacy
of IRAK4-L inhibition in MDS by a clinical-grade IRAK4 kinase inhibitor. In vitro sensitivity and
differentiation assays in U2AF1- and SF3B1-mutant, and SF wildtype MDS cells will be
conducted. Patient derived xenografts with U2AF1/SF3B1-mutant, and SF wildtype MDS will be
treated with the IRAK4 inhibitors to examine for suppression of the disease-propagating cells. We
will also determine whether overexpression of IRAK4-long isoforms is predictive of response in
an ongoing clinical trial of IRAK4 inhibitor. Taken together, these studies will determine the role
of splicing mutation induced IRAK4-L isoform in MDS pathobiology. Importantly, these studies will
lead to potential targeted clinical trials with clinically relevant inhibitors of IRAK4 in MDS."

curriculum with a focus on the biology of cancer that interfaces with clinicians engaged in cancer diagnosis and
treatment provides an excellent means of training specialists with a sufficient breadth of perspective for
successful careers in cancer research, education, clinical care or policy. This is an application for renewal of a
T32 training grant, currently in its 35th year, to support 6 pre-doctoral students in Cancer Biology at Wayne State
University (WSU) and the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI). Trainees include PhD and MD/PhD
candidates primarily from the Cancer Biology Graduate Program (CBGP) in the Department of Oncology, along
with a smaller number of trainees from other affiliated PhD programs at WSU. Training draws from the
outstanding clinical and research facilities at WSU/KCI and the expertise of 20 accomplished preceptors in areas
including neoplastic development, invasion and metastasis, cancer drug discovery, cancer immunology, and
population studies and cancer disparities. This T32 training grant provides an important cornerstone of our
training program in the biology of cancer at WSU/KCI. The CBGP offers specialized didactic training in basic and
translational principles of Cancer Biology, along with seminars by nationally/internationally recognized speakers,
student-faculty research retreats, and opportunities to attend national/international research conferences. PhD
students are introduced to state-of-the-art research methods in molecular and cell biology, chemical biology,
pharmacology, immunology, and epidemiology, and to cutting-edge technologies through the KCI research
cores, while performing hypothesis-based cancer research. Students “round” with oncologists in the KCI Cancer
Hospital and receive didactic training on clinical research by academic physicians who lead our clinical trials.
Training in the responsible conduct of research, rigorous experimental design and data science is provided.
“Value added” educational opportunities for T32 fellows include a workshop on F30/F31 fellowship preparation,
a T32 research mini-symposium, enhanced career networking, specialized technology workshops and research
conferences, training in community outreach, and individualized career mentoring. The goals of our T32 training
program are to develop scientists with a strong foundational training and perspective in Cancer Biology, with
outstanding capacities for critical thinking, effective communication and networking skills needed for professional
success in the coming decades. Reflecting our emphasis at KCI/WSU on reducing cancer disparities, an
additional goal of our training program is to encourage workforce diversity by educating trainees from diverse
backgrounds. As documented in this application, T32 CA009531 has trained an accomplished group of cancer

 The core mission of the MorPhiC program is to define the function of every human gene through the
creation of a comprehensive catalog of null phenotypes using multicellular systems. The impact of gene loss
on complex phenotypes is strongly influenced by the cellular context and the genetic background. Therefore, it
is essential to develop scalable knockout methods in diverse genetic backgrounds followed by robust
phenotyping assays in multicellular systems that are informative of human biology. Our Production Center will
leverage our collective expertise in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) guided differentiation, organoid
engineering, gene editing, and our extensive experience combining large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout
phenotyping with hPSC differentiation. We plan to conduct extensive curation and quality control to select a
panel of ~100 hPSC lines, including mostly induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and some embryonic
stem cell (ESC) lines, from diverse ancestral populations, and from males and females to generate an hPSC
repository for distribution. We will further prioritize genes affected in neurodevelopmental and metabolic
disorders (e.g., autism and diabetes) for conducting knockouts in these diverse hPSC lines for sharing with the
scientific community. For investigation of knockout phenotypes, we will optimize three distinct multicellular
systems, a micropattern-based gastruloid model for early tri-germ-layer differentiation, a defined neuro-glial tri-
culture system, and a 3D pancreatic islet-like organoid culture. Using these multicellular systems with different
levels of complexity, we will then conduct extensive phenotyping assays in a multitiered system to allow scaled
analysis both in terms of the genes analyzed and the hPSC line background (reflective of the human genetic
background). Primary human islets will be included for several phenotyping assays to test the generalizability
beyond the hPSC systems. We expect to work with consortium partners to prioritize the target genes for Phase
1 of the MorPhiC project, develop standards for data and resource sharing, and optimize methods for joint
analyses. Our Production Center is expected to deliver a rich resource of knockout human pluripotent stem cell
lines from diverse genetic backgrounds, extensive knockout phenotyping datasets in multicellular contexts that
are informative of diverse human biology, robust and scalable knockout and phenotyping pipelines along with
associated transferable methods, and establish strong use cases for the MorPhiC catalog. The optimized
mutagenesis and phenotyping pipelines along with the scalable methods will pave the way for a full-scale
MorPhiC catalog production effort in Phase 2."
10914820,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapeutic agents for a
plethora of diseases and conditions. Over 1% of our population receives GC prescriptions annually. Despite
the very broad and potent anti-inflammatory effects, prolonged GC therapy can cause serious side effects,
including damage to the eye. Between 30-75% of individuals receiving prolonged GC therapy develop GC-
induced ocular hypertension (OHT), which if unrecognized can lead to iatrogenic open-angle glaucoma and
permanent vision loss. Despite recognition of this significant GC side effect for more than six decades, we still
do not understand the reason for differences in susceptibility to GC-induced OHT or the mechanism(s) of
action responsible for GC-OHT. We have previously shown that the alternative spliced dominant negative
isoform of the glucocorticoid receptor (GRb) inhibits GC activity in cultured human TM cells. TM cells isolated
from glaucoma donor eyes (GTM) have low GRb levels and are therefore more sensitive to GCs. Although a
number of studies have examined the DEX-induced transcriptome in TM cells and tissues, there is no
indication which of the differentially expressed genes or molecular pathways are involved in GC-OHT. Several
studies have shown that susceptibility to develop GC-OHT is genetically inherited, but no genes have been
definitively linked to GC-OHT. Our overall hypothesis is that GC-OHT is: (a) determined by the ratio of
endogenous GRa to GRb expression in the TM; (b) mediated by specific molecular pathways that can be
differentiated from GC-responder and non-responder eyes; and (c) genetically determined so that GC-OHT
genes can be mapped and identified. This overall hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims. Specific Aim #1:
Determine the role of endogenous GRb in regulating GC-OHT in human anterior segment ex vivo perfusion
culture and in vivo in mice. Specific Aim #2: Determine the TM transcriptome in GC-OHT resistant and
sensitive strains of mice and in anterior segment perfusion cultured human eyes in order to identify the
molecular pathways that are responsible for GC-OHT. Specific Aim #3: Map and identify the genes
responsible for GC-OHT using QTL of the BXD recombinant inbred mouse lines. This research is innovative
in that we will evaluate the role of endogenous GRb in mouse strains (with our new mouse model of GC-OHT)
and in ex vivo perfusion cultured human anterior segments that differ in sensitivity to GC-OHT, use mouse
strains and human perfusion cultured anterior segments that are differentially responsive to GC-OHT to
molecularly dissect the pathway responsible for GC-OHT, and map GC-OHT genes using BXD recombinant
inbred mice. This work is essential and significant because our experimental results will help determine the
role of endogenous GRb in regulating responsiveness to GC-OHT, the molecular mechanisms responsible for
GC-OHT, and the best and most effective way to predict steroid responders, which still is an important unmet
clinical need as GC-OHT is becoming increasingly prevalent."
10915493,"The Translational Neuroscience Core will: 1) provide IDDRC investigators with facilities and services to support
their individual human neuroimaging and psychophysiological research programs in the area of intellectual and

psychophysiological measures in humans with IDD and IDD mouse models; 3) utilize repositories of ‘big data’
at Vanderbilt to develop new tools and discoveries for IDD; 4) facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations among
IDDRC investigators who may or may not have neuroimaging expertise; and 5) ensure that the services
provided are timely, highest quality, and cost-effective. The Translational Neuroscience Core C will support
P50 users in the above areas for magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging as well as psychophysiological
measures. The Core’s services can be broadly construed into two different categories: (1) those that are
responsive to investigators’ needs and (2) those that are generative, and provide new directions in IDD
for investigators to leverage. Investigator need-based services provided include assistance in (a) experimental
design, including selecting appropriate tasks for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electroencephalogram
(EEG)/event-related potentials (ERP), (b) identification of the optimal modalities of MR imaging or
EEG/ERP/eye tracking acquisition parameters (c) implementation of MRI and EEG/ERP data collection with
special populations (individuals with various IDDs, especially infants and children), and (d) management and
analysis of MRI and EEG/ERP/eye tracking data. The generative and innovative component of the
Translational Neuroscience Core C focuses on key areas that are of particular interest for IDD researchers:
design of novel experimental paradigms optimized for IDDs, expanding trans-species imaging capabilities,
implementing and augmenting novel data acquisition and analysis methods for measuring neural biomarkers of
IDD, developing robust image processing techniques to handle challenging data (e.g., movement artifacts),
and providing tools to enable optimal establishment, usage, and analysis of ‘big data’ repositories such as
ImageVU. While expertise and resources in neuroimaging, advanced computing, and data management tools
are available at Vanderbilt University, none are tailored for the special needs of those who study IDDs.
The Aims and services in Core C all have the central goal: facilitate cost-efficient discovery that leads to the
prevention and/or amelioration of IDD. Each member of the Core has strong ties to the larger Vanderbilt

10915496,"The Behavioral Phenotyping Core (Core D) is designed to support three overarching aims: To support and
promote innovative and replicable behavioral phenotyping data in clinical populations people with IDD (Aim 1)
and in rodent models of IDD (Aim 2); and to facilitate translational research incorporating human and animal
data approaches (Aim 3). Previously supported iterations of this Core have been highly generative in terms of
grant submission and manuscript support. The guiding thematic focus of the newly designed Core supports the
“non-traditional” emphasis articulated for the overarching goals of the IDDRC in incorporating non-traditional
researchers, non-traditional populations, and non-traditional approaches into every facet of the core. The Core
will accomplish these goals by providing six major services: (i) Consultation. The three Co-Directors (Peters,
Harrison, Wallace) have complementary expertise in human and animal phenotyping including specific
experience with project design and analysis approaches. Consultation services will serve to support rigorous
experimental design by IDD researchers and, importantly, support non-IDD researchers who wish to develop
IDD-relevant projects despite lack of previous experience (non-traditional researchers). Consultation services
are supported by comprehensive (ii) training for Core users. Training includes hands-on support for
equipment use (animal and human research) and clinical assessment training. A new focus of the Core is to
support the use of wearable devices and the use of apps for in-home behavioral observation in order to provide
the opportunity for non-traditional populations to participate in research. Training will therefore also extend to
non-scientist care-givers for in-home testing. Key to the Core’s success in prior funding periods has been the
ability to provide (iii) access to equipment and facilities. State-of-the-art facilities and equipment for human
and animal testing will continue to be supported for IDD researchers to use on a discounted fee-for-service
basis. (iv) Full-service phenotyping is now offered for both human and animal testing conducted by trained
research technicians. This service will permit non-traditional researchers to perform IDD-related research
regardless of IDD-related experience, increase testing throughput, particularly for smaller laboratories, and
support experimental rigor. The Core will continue to offer (v) scientific Instrumentation fabrication services
for specialized equipment for human and animal projects. The final service (vi) data integration and
conceptual development is designed as a complement to consultation service for basic science investigators
who wish expand their work into human clinical populations, as well as for clinically-oriented investigators
wishing to expand into animal models. This truly translational service will enable similar methods and models
to be utilized or adapted across species to directly measure phenotypically relevant outcomes including
behavioral and physiological measures, therefore encapsulating the IDDRC’s overarching goal to accelerate
discovery in IDD research through trans-disciplinary approaches."
10915499,"The success and impact of nearly every project in IDD hinges on the proper use of statistical techniques. Thus,
Core E has a critical role in facilitating research for all IDDRC investigators, as well as for the progress of the
other IDDRC Cores and Signature Research Project. Core E performs a unique function for IDDRC
investigators as it helps them identify and use the statistical and methodological expertise and resources
available at Vanderbilt University (VU) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) that are appropriate
for their questions – especially for more complicated research designs (e.g., many layers of nesting) or those
with statistical limitations (e.g., small sample sizes common in research with rare populations). Further, through
generative activity with Clinical Translational and Translational Neuroscience Cores B and C, Core E provides
sophisticated and non-trivial statistical methods and models tailored to IDD-related scientific questions (e.g.,
Bayesian spatio-temporal models for neuroimaging analysis). In addition to having considerable expertise in
biostatistics, neuro-statistics, and quantitative psychology, Vanderbilt is also a national leader in developing big
data structures and mining that data to advance health and development research, including the Synthetic
Derivative (SD), a de-identified dataset of electronic health record data collected from over ~2.8 million total
records. Though such big data structures are incredible resources to Vanderbilt, and especially IDDRC
investigators with their ability to capture large samples of rare disorders, it can be challenging to put the data in
analyzable formats and select suitable statistical approaches for analysis. Core E enables IDDRC investigators
to fully capitalize on all these VU/VUMC resources through three aims: Aim 1, which provides access to
modern statistical and data science methods to answer questions of relevance to IDD, including conducting
data analyses for the Signature IDDRC Research Project; Aim 2, which enhances training in IDD research for
those engaging in data science methods, including implementing a novel internal training grant program
between Data Sciences Institute trainees and the IDDRC; and Aim 3, which supports innovation in health-
related IDD research by facilitating use of large data sets such as the SD, including providing cutting-edge
consultations and tools for working with large-scale SD IDD-curated database that IDDRC investigators can
use for generating pilot data and conducting studies. Collectively, Core E’s aims and generative work and
interactions with other IDDRC Cores not only meets the immediate needs of IDDRC investigators, but also
anticipates future ones, by allowing for novel resources, platforms, and methods to be developed. By tackling
and solving complex, multi-modal data science questions, Core E is poised to contribute substantially
over the next 5 years to accelerating scientific discovery to improve the outcomes of people with IDDs."
10915501,"The Administrative Core supports the mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM IDDRC) to identify as many causes of IDD as
possible, to understand their pathogenesis, and to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches by
providing oversight and management of the activities of the entire Center, disseminating information about
advancements and coordinating collaborative efforts with researchers in the IDDRC network and around the
world. Dr. Huda Zoghbi has served as the Center Director for more than 25 years and is joined by Drs. David
Nelson and Rodney Samaco to form the Executive Team of the Administrative Core. The Executive Team is
dedicated to ensuring that the BCM IDDRC is a most innovative and efficient Center. The overarching goal of
the Administrative Core is to enhance IDD research activities at BCM by encouraging and fostering local and
collaborative research efforts, the development of therapies to treat IDD, attracting and training investigators to
enhance the workforce in IDD research and disseminating information through engagement, communication and
education of stakeholders. This Core will support faculty research into IDD through provision of strategic
core facilities and by developing new core services as fields advance. All research projects are proposed
for use of the Administrative Core. This Core helps align core services to the overall mission of the Center, works
with the Core Directors to monitor and ensure that the services provided are high-quality and cost-effective, and
ensures that the Core services capitalize on existing resources and institutional support from BCM. The core will
also support translational efforts in IDD through the Clinical Translational Core, designed to assist investigators
with designing and carrying out human research including IRB approval, acquisition of biospecimens, diagnostic
studies, and therapeutic interventions for people with IDD and a multidisciplinary signature research project
that will lead to clinical trial readiness, developing biomarkers specific and sensitive to altered gene dosage. In
order to promote and enhance collaborative efforts and dissemination of knowledge, the Core proposes
a plan for engagement, communication, and education (ECE), extending the reach of the Center’s activities
to stakeholders at the local, state, and national levels. The ECE will implement best practices for community
partnerships building on and extending existing community relationships to ensure ongoing bi-directional
communication, inform investigators and the community of questions/concerns by each group, ensure successful
recruitment and retention of study participants, and determine feasibility of future studies in this population. The
Administrative Core recognizes the importance of broad collaborations, especially with the IDDRC network and
will continue to contribute to and collaborate with all network activities."
10915503,"In its current form, the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) IDDRC’s Clinical Translational Core (CTC) has
provided an outstanding platform to integrate basic science researchers, clinical investigators, and clinicians with
infrastructure and resources to enable the translation of many mechanistic discoveries from our center into the
clinical realm. In this proposal, we are excited to build upon the success of our CTC and expand on the services
using a new administrative and novel core structure that will allow us to leverage our strengths for developing
therapies for IDD. The new structure and services were born from our “evolving Core theme” in order to
accommodate and translate the new and exciting discoveries from our center investigators.
 The CTC will be composed of three units: Study Design and Implementation Unit, Biospecimen and Data
Unit, and Center Navigation Unit that will collaborate closely with other cores of the BCM IDDRC, national and
international networks, patient registries, patients, and stakeholders to facilitate all aspects of transitional
research in IDD. A vision that we have for our CTC is that it should have an impact beyond our local center and
that our processes and activities should be of use to other centers and IDD researchers across the United States.
In line with that vision, the CTC will establish a Clinical Outcome Assessment Panel that will leverage the
significant preclinical and clinical expertise at our center to develop and validate endpoints for clinical trials which
would be critical for clinical trial readiness. Additionally, the CTC will work towards having a biospecimen
repository from which precious samples can be shared with other centers and researchers. Finally, as the future
of IDD research is dependent on young clinicians and scientists, the CTC will focus on training the next-
generation of clinical and translational researchers in IDD.
 We strongly believe that the CTC will be the nidus by which: 1) basic researchers will have access to
clinical information and human samples and thus be integrated into the clinical enterprise, 2) basic research
questions will be validated in a clinical arena, and 3) newer diagnostic modalities and therapies will be fostered.
The structure and services of the CTC will not only facilitate the translation of findings from the “bench-to-the-
bedside”, but also drive research in the laboratory based on phenotypic observations made in the clinics. Such
bidirectional translation will not only advance the basic science research but also make a significant impact on
the care of the patients with IDD."
10915505,"DNA-based therapy has made tremendous advances recently, as evident by the increase in emerging potential
therapies such as gene replacement and antisense oligonucleotides to alter splicing or downregulate an extra
allele. These therapies hold the promise to treat many IDDs; however, major challenges must be addressed to
achieve successful clinical trials. Safety of such therapies is of the utmost importance since many of the genes
are dosage sensitive. It is therefore critical to identify outcome measures sensitive to target engagement and
able to detect overtreatment and unintended conversion of gain-of-function phenotypes into a loss-of-function
phenotypes, and vice versa. Here, we focus on MECP2- (Rett vs. MECP2 Duplication), RAI1- (Smith-Magenis
vs. Potocki-Lupski syndrome) and SHANK3- (Phelan-McDermid vs. SHANK3 Duplication) associated disorders
as test cases of IDDs that are caused by alterations of these dosage-dependent genes. We propose to identify
molecular and neurocircuitry mediators/effectors of dosage alterations of these genes, both peripherally and
centrally, to develop composite biomarkers that are responsive to gene dosage in each individual at their
particular disease stage. Toward this goal, we capitalize on the established patient cohorts at Baylor College of
Medicine, which
has an extensive history in studying these disorders and their genetics. In Aim 1, we will
establish patient-specific molecular signatures of human induced neurons (iNs), derived from both fibroblasts
and inducible pluripotent stem cells, and blood, using metabolomics and transcriptomics. In Aim 2, we will
establish patient-specific autonomic and sensory neurocircuitry signatures of the momentary disease stage
and severity using novel pre-pulse inhibition paradigm, pupillometry, and evoked potentials. These signatures
will be obtained twice from the same subject, 8-12 months apart, to assess stability. We will then integrate
these dense multimodal datasets from each subject to generate a composite biomarker that accurately
represents personalized response to the gene dosage level at that particular time. In contrast to conventional
population studies – and in the spirit of precision medicine – this analysis framework relies on complete and
diverse datasets from each participant because safety at the individual level is paramount to avoid causing
unintended phenotypes. This project is possible because of the ability to access the innovative services from
all the cores. The strategies we develop will provide a template to advance the use of DNA-based therapy for
treatment of many monogenic disorders and could help inform many disorders that are gene dosage-
dependent. The patient-specific cell lines, molecular, and circuit data will be available for the scientific
community in perpetuity, will complement natural history studies, and will inform future clinical trials. Lastly, the
new methodologies for examining neurocircuitry and the integrative data analysis approaches at multiple levels
will potentially provide transformative tools and analytical algorithms for assessment, safe dosing, and
accelerated clinical trials for multiple gene dosage-dependent IDDs."
10915506,"The goal of the Molecular and Expression Analysis (MEA) Core is to provide BCM IDDRC investigators with
access to high-throughput methods that can identify and quantify global phenotypic differences between fluids,
cells or tissues at the level of gene expression, protein expression, post-translational modification, and cell
metabolism. Targeted versions of these molecular technologies are valuable for testing and verifying molecular
outcomes in genetic models for disease, but the unbiased nature of many platforms makes them exciting tools
for identifying the mechanistic basis for disease and for direct discovery of biomarkers. The RNA Profiling
sub-core will enable IDDRC investigators to characterize transcriptomes at the single cell level using several
complementary RNA-seq commercial platforms, and to visualize and validate by imaging gene expression
patterns in tissues by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and imaging. Differential gene expression inferred from
untargeted transcriptomics can help researchers confirm models, but it can also reveal unanticipated findings
about gene regulatory networks; targeted RNA ISH can validate and visualize these findings in brain tissue.
The Protein and Metabolite Profiling sub-core will provide services and expertise to identify and profile
proteins, protein complexes, post-translational modifications, and metabolites. Proteomics can provide key
insights into the states of protein regulatory networks that control cellular phenotypes, and differences in small
molecule levels revealed by untargeted metabolomics of fluids from animal models or patients can identify
biochemical imbalances and biomarkers for disease. Because processing and interpreting data generated by
these platforms is challenging, the Data Analysis and Integration sub-core will provide computational and
data science expertise to assist IDDRC investigators with analysis of RNA sequencing data, proteomics LC-
MS data, metabolomics LC-HRMS data, and metabolomics NMR data. The Core will also develop new
computational methods to extract information from data derived from the same biological samples but across
different -omics platforms. By providing access to a suite of platforms for the molecular characterization of
phenotype, and the data analysis expertise needed to make sense of these complex systems, the MEA Core
will enable researchers to identify molecular changes that lead to or report on pathogenic mechanism in IDDs.
Tracking differences between healthy and disease states across these different modalities may yield
connections between the genetic, gene regulatory, and biochemical basis for neural dysfunction."
10915510,"Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) are common and have a devastating impact on child health
around the world. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments for the vast majority of IDDs and our
understanding of the pathogenic mechanism for majority of IDDs is incomplete. A major impediment to solving
how to better treat IDDs is our limited knowledge of how cells and tissues are impacted in each IDD. As a
direct response to this problem, we have assembled the Cell and Tissue Pathogenesis Core (CTP Core) to
study how brain anatomy and its associated pathologies arise. Our guiding rationale is that, solving how brain
structure is wired in typical development will place us in an ideal position to uncover how faulty brain circuits
eventually disrupt the ability to perform different behaviors in IDDs. Indeed, the pathological consequences of
altering brain development typically present as severe motor or cognitive difficulties in children. The goal of the
CTP Core is to provide our IDDRC Investigators with a centralized resource for comprehensive pathological
examination of tissue, high-resolution two-photon and confocal imaging, ultra-structure tracking by electron
microcopy, and the generation and characterization of human disease cellular models that are relevant to
IDDs. By combining human cellular models, such as iPSC-derived neurons or glia, with deep structural and
functional phenotyping of how the brain is mis-wired in different diseases or disease models, the CTP Core will
provide a unique opportunity to address how distinct genetic and environmental factors may impact the brain
and lead to alterations in cellular structure, connectivity and function. To accomplish these goals, we have
divided the CTP Core into three sub-Cores that operate in parallel, but with the common goal of resolving brain
structure as it relates to function and disease. The Neuropathology Sub-Core provides expertise in neuronal
tissue analysis from basic histology and transmission electron microscopy to in-depth circuit analysis; the
Microscopy Sub-Core provides access and training to state-of-the-art confocal and two-photon microscopy;
and the Human Disease Cellular Models Sub-Core provides expertise for studies requiring reprogramming,
characterization and genome editing of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their progeny
derived from IDD patients. Therefore, a major feature of the CTP Core is investigator access to both classic
and modern analytical techniques using human tissue, in vivo model systems such as mouse, rat, drosophila,
and in vitro assays such as 3-dimensional brain organoids and neurons and glia derived from human iPSCs.
The ultimate goal of the CTP Core is to forge new avenues to improve the behavioral outcomes of IDD by
correcting brain function and restoring various motor and cognitive functions. The availability of major
equipment such as transmission and two-photon microscopes, existing effective workflow of services, and the
collective experience with many disease models highlight the arsenal of tools available to BCM IDDRC
investigators."
10915512,"Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) manifest as dysfunction in neural circuits. Thus, understanding
and ultimately treating IDDs requires directly and precisely interfacing with neural circuits in animal models and
the human brain. The goal of the Circuit Analysis & Modulation (CAM) Core is to provide a set of techniques
and approaches for BCM IDDRC investigators, and the broader scientific community, which provide a path from
hypothesis to pre-clinical readiness regarding neural circuit dysfunction in IDDs. The CAM Core is comprised of
three sub-cores. The Tool Generation & Characterization sub-core will develop neurotropic viruses tailored to
the particular needs of IDDRC neural circuit studies, and provide assistance applying the tools to their
experiments. We will focus on lenti- and adeno-associated viral vectors that are engineered to drive gene
expression in desired cell types. In particular, constructed viruses will allow investigators to target mainstay and
emerging powerful optogenetic proteins to individual neurons, neuronal subsets, or desired lineages to suit their
experimental design. These viral vectors afford the spatial and temporal flexibility of stereotaxic targeting, and
provide a time- and cost-efficient alternative to transgenic mouse design. These tools provide valuable
information about neuronal firing properties or patterns of connectivity, or provide a means to synthetically
perturb function, facilitating study of normal circuit function or disease. The Circuit Assessment sub-core will
provide assessment of sensory and neuromodulatory systems in mice and humans, both of which feature
prominently in many IDDs. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustics startle is at the intersection of sensory and
neuromodulatory functions, and PPI deficits are observed in many IDDs. We offer use of our novel human ‘brain
state and cognition’ testing suite, which uses pupillometry to extract multiple indicators of neuromodulatory
function in sensory recognition and sensorimotor gating, as well as an analogous high-throughput mouse system
to IDDRC members. We also offer sophisticated attention tasks that tap into broader circuits, and two-photon
imaging of circuit function in the PPI and attention tasks. The Circuit Modulation sub-core will perform in vivo
neural recordings and targeted brain stimulation for IDDRC investigators. Combining optogenetic and
chemogenetic methods with neurophysiological recordings allows testing circuit mechanisms with ground truth
electrical readouts. In addition, targeted chronic deep brain stimulation has been increasingly applied to function-
specific neuronal assemblies or pathways in preclinical studies of various neurological diseases, including IDDs.
Thus we will provide assistance, design, and service towards testing targeted electrophysiological recordings or
stimulation of nervous tissue in rodent models of IDD. In sum, the CAM core as a whole will provide powerful
viral tools, electrical and optical recording and stimulation approaches, and cross-species non-invasive circuit
assessment, in order to translate hypotheses about neural circuit dysfunction into pre-clinical readiness for IDD
treatments."
10915397,"Abstract
 During the past three and one-half years of R01 grant support, we have made substantial progress in:
a) assessing the role of C3 in the newly discovered intracellular complement system (ICS or “complosome”),
including its modulation by CD46 signaling, b) developing an assay to quantitate a biologically active form of
C3 known as C3(H2O), c) identifying a receptor-mediated C3(H2O) uptake process common to most cell types,
and d) determining the ICS response in cells and an organ system (the airway) to ischemic and immune-
mediated attack. Our immediate and ongoing goals are to publish our results describing the human receptor for
C3(H2O) as well as studies demonstrating that C3 expression by lung transplants is reduced in alloimmune-
mediated injury. We are also further delineating complosome activation and regulatory mechanisms at the
RNA and protein level and are extending our analyses to human peripheral blood phagocytic, epithelial and,
especially, endothelial cell populations. A further goal is to dissect the role of the ICS, utilizing both an in vitro
model system with primary human cells isolated from lung tissue donors and corresponding human cell lines,
as well as in mouse models of infection. Thus, we propose to continue to develop and employ model systems
to obtain a detailed map of how a cell type's complosome functions in normal homeostasis as well as its
response to cellular damage and malignancy. Such analyses will likely trigger new insights into how
dysfunctions of this system correlate with human diseases.
 An important goal of this proposal relates to oncology. In addition to its role as an inhibitor of
complement activation on host cells and a critical component of the complosome, CD46 is emerging as a key
player in both malignant transformation and cancer immunotherapy. On one hand, CD46 is overexpressed on
many tumors, yet on the other hand, it is targeted by therapeutic oncolytic viruses that use it as a docking
mechanism. We have contributed to these studies and now plan to dissect the rationale of its overexpression
and its effect on the complosome, beginning with multiple myeloma in collaboration with the Siteman Cancer
Center. The models developed will be extended subsequently to other types of cancers.
 In summary, our proposal draws on the strength of our long-term commitment to the field of
complement research and our ambitious undertakings related to defining the mechanisms and players of the
newly discovered ICS. We are especially attracted to this grant mechanism because of its flexibility. This
proposal draws not only on the expertise of the PI, but also on a team of talented individuals who are well
positioned to continue being leaders the field by creating more innovative model systems and obtaining a
comprehensive map that expands our knowledge-base relative to the “workings” of the ICS."
10915399,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients in intensive care units are at high risk for long-term health threats including cognitive impairment. The
correlation was only recently revealed after large-scale follow-up cognitive assessments on intensive patient
survivors after their discharge from the hospital. There are testimonials, reviews and calls-to-action on many
critical care websites and in journal issues over the last decade on this public health crisis. Studies have
implicated delirium as a good predictor for long-term cognitive deficit; however, the causative and molecular
mechanisms leading to abrupt cognitive impairment are unclear.
In the past 4 years, our studies have discovered that patients in the intensive care unit who contracted
bacterial pneumonia have elevated levels of cytotoxic amyloids in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma,
and the cerebrospinal fluid. Rodent brain slices incubated in the cerebrospinal fluids collected from bacterial
pneumonia-positive patients show dampened hippocampal long-term potentiation. In comparison, synaptic
strengthening is prominent in slices incubated in bacterial pneumonia-negative patients’ cerebrospinal fluid.
Moreover, immunopurified from the cerebrospinal fluid or plasma using selective antibodies against Aβ and 𝜏
oligomers and injected into rodents, these cytotoxins induce neuronal dendritic spine retraction, reduce spine
density, and impair animal learning.
Our previous in vitro studies have implicated that in response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, lung
endothelium produces and releases cytotoxins including Aβ and 𝜏 species, and the cytotoxicity and bioactivity
of these species are dependent upon the bacterial virulence. These endothelium-derived cytotoxins damage
endothelial barrier integrity, hinder vascular repair following injury and, importantly, they are released into the
systemic circulation in vivo. Thus, in this competitive renewal, the studies are designed to test the hypothesis
that bacterial pneumonia-elicited lung endothelium-derived amyloids include pathological Aβ and 𝜏 species
capable of dissemination and initiating aggregation. This work addresses a novel mechanism underlying the
end organ dysfunction by systemically quantify cytotoxins released from endothelium in vitro, in rodents, and in
patient specimens."
10909262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV is a social disease with biomedical implications, wreaking havoc on families and communities far
beyond what can be addressed in clinics alone. The majority of research and intervention funding goes
towards clinical care to suppress viral transmission. Behavioral, social, economic and psychological
consequences and determinants of HIV progression go largely unaddressed in global funding priorities.
Families with HIV experience more violence, poverty, food insecurity, dysfunction, social exclusion and street-
migration by their children than families who are not living with HIV. Research is required to determine the
most effective, low-cost and scalable mechanisms to address the wide range of factors unaddressed by clinical
care. This project adapts our intervention, Kuja Pamoja (“Come Together”), to empower families living with
HIV. We developed Kuja Pamoja in the broader population in rural Kenya to prevent street-migration of
children and support community reintegration of former street children. Kuja Pamoja-HIV will utilize a group-
savings model to develop social capital (e.g. trust, expectations of mutual benefit and normative influence).
Accrued social capital is then leveraged to address a wide range of determinants (e.g. economic and food
insecurity, family violence and dysfunction, social exclusion, and ART adherence), mental health (e.g. reduce
depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress), and behavioral health (e.g. improved retention in care and ART
adherence). Among families living with HIV, we aim to improve mental health and viral suppression among
adolescents and adults with HIV. The project will develop a new care model that can scale across low-income
settings and improve HIV-related outcomes. If successful, the model will provide a template to improve health
care delivery and outcomes in other areas – e.g. Maternal/child health, chronic disease conditions, and
tuberculosis.
 The project also contributes to my career development. A well-established team of mentors and
advisors will serve to advance my career by guiding me through coursework, reading, conferences, and other
sources of professional research networking to ensure that I gain essential research skills, mental health and
clinical knowledge, and improved understanding of the determinants of health. Specifically, I will undergo
mentored coursework in implementation science, intervention mapping, mental health, interventions to improve
economic and food security, and advanced skills in statistical analysis and epidemiological research design. I
will meet with established researchers with NIH funding. Through these activities, I will receive mentorship and
formal training in grantsmanship, longitudinal data analysis, cohort retention, intervention development and
mapping, implementation science and improved comprehension of family violence and mental health. The
career development portion plus the research project will lead to the development of a competitive R01
application."
10909269,"Maintaining genetic integrity is crucial for cell viability and disease suppression. Consequently, cellular
machinery such as the DNA damage response (DDR) has evolved to combat continual genotoxic insults.
Whilst specific DNA repair mechanisms have been defined in great detail, understanding the spatiotemporal
regulation of DDR factors in the cell remains a key challenge. Here, the covalent postranslational modifiers
(PTMs) SUMO and ubiquitin play critical roles, both recruiting DDR proteins to DNA lesions, and then removing
them as necessary to promote repair. Indeed, defects in the SUMO and ubiquitin pathways cause failed DDR
orchestration, severe genetic instability, and disease. Therefore, the overarching goal of our research is to
delineate SUMO and ubiquitin mediated mechanisms that maintain genome integrity, with an eye to identifying
and exploiting potential therapeutic avenues. Our proposal centers on two factors, STUbL and SMC5/6, which
integrate signaling through SUMO and ubiquitin to support key health-related processes. Of note, STUbL
mediates the therapeutic effects of arsenic trioxide in leukemia, and SMC5/6 mutations cause severe disease.
STUbL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that selectively recognizes and ubiquitinates SUMOylated proteins to promote
their degradation and/or extraction from chromatin. SMC5/6 is functionally related to cohesin and condensin
but uniquely, can modify targets with SUMO and ubiquitin. To provide functional insights, we used proximity
labeling to reliably map the proteomic environments of STUbL and SMC5/6 in key health-related settings such
as: dysfunctional telomeres, DNA repair, and viral replication. Surprisingly, considerable overlap was identified
between each proteome, creating further synergy and efficiency in our research. For example, the functions
and targets of SMC5/6 and STUbL intersect in the “alternative lengthening of telomeres” (ALT) pathway used
in ~15% of cancers. Thus, we would define STUbL and SMC5/6 roles in the elongation and “trimming” of
telomeres through the novel ALT-specific targets and cofactors we identified. In addition, a wealth of recent
data supports our hypothesis that STUbL controls SUMO pathway homeostasis, as well as specific targets, to
support genome stability, DNA replication, and cell survival. Further analysis using genetic manipulation of the
SUMO pathway (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9), mediators of SUMO chain toxicity, and new STUbL targets would
establish this key paradigm in SUMO and ubiquitin pathway crosstalk. We also recently identified an SMC5/6
cofactor that binds SUMO and directs the complex to phase-separated ALT PML nuclear bodies, sites of viral
replication, and likely DNA lesions, thereby unifying these seemingly disparate processes. Hence, we would
define functions for SMC5/6 and its new SUMO binding cofactor in each of these processes to reveal common
mechanisms. Overall, our collaborative teams' analysis of STUbL and SMC5/6 using proteomic, genetic, cell
biological, biochemical, and biophysical methods would synergize to define key health-related mechanisms at
the nexus of the SUMO and ubiquitin pathways; providing targets and guidance for therapeutic interventions."
10909271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Improvements in health care access and infection control have led to life expectancy increases in Low- and
Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) in Latin America. As the population ages, the Latin American cancer burden
has dramatically increased. By 2030, Latin America is expected to have annual averages of 1.6M new cancer
cases and 1M cancer deaths. A Latin America Lancet Oncology Commission report highlighted the small
amount of preclinical and clinical oncology research originating in the region as a limitation to control cancer
burden. Colombia and Peru, the Latin American LMICs with the first and second largest populations, have
state-funded national cancer institutes (NCIs) that are cancer treatment reference centers, and which lead
national efforts in cancer control and care. However, cancer risk assessment and patient treatment at these
institutions is primarily based on tools developed in North American and European patients. Despite having
exceptional researchers and physicians, most cancer centers in Latin America lack training programs that
would allow them to develop or adapt precision prevention or treatment tools that are appropriate to the
ancestry or mutation profiles of individuals from the region. The current funding opportunity is the ideal
program to formalize and enhance ongoing collaborations between US-based healthcare researchers and
providers in Colombia and Peru. It will provide a solid foundation for precision oncology research knowledge
transfer and to build local human capital necessary to develop precision cancer medicine in Latin America.
Building on our extensive expertise on Latin American population demography, cancer epidemiology and
genetics, NIH funded cancer studies in Latino populations, and a strong track record of research collaboration
and training with Colombian and Peruvian researchers, the overall goals of the UC Davis Multidisciplinary
Cancer Research Training Program to Advance Precision Cancer Prevention and Care in Latin America are to:
1) Enhance local capacity for precision cancer medicine research in Colombia and Peru by implementing a
curriculum that complements and addresses gaps in local training programs and provides hands on experience
and support for research project development relevant to the region, 2) Provide hands on training on research
resource development including ethics training, biobanking best practices, and cloud-based bioinformatics; and
3) allocate pilot funding for mentored research for basic science and clinically-oriented term trainees. We
propose to establish a curriculum to train graduate students and postdoctoral/clinical fellows in precision
oncology research. We will prepare trainees to implement and share their new skills in their home countries
and to collaborate with U.S-based investigators. We will leverage ongoing collaborations among the program
Principal Investigators, universities, and NCIs of Colombia and Peru to identify relevant areas of research that
could be enhanced by the training program."
10909216,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases are a growing concern worldwide as the consequences
are often lethal, or at best they leave patients incapacitated. Unfortunately, most patients with these
diseases do not respond to the current medications, and in the few cases that do work, they too can
eventually develop drug resistance. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a neurosurgical approach, has
become an effective treatment when traditional medicines are not an option. However, even DBS has
its limitations, as a large number of people do not respond to the treatment. Research using humans
and animal models suggests that the current brain locations into which DBS is directed are not
always adequate. As a first step towards identifying better targets for brain repair, we designed a
genetic toolkit in mice that provides a versatile method for generating mouse models for severe motor
disease. The toolkit is based on controlling the function of neural circuits in a brain region called the
cerebellum, a structure involved in motor and cognitive function and a susceptibility site in a growing
list of brain diseases. In Aim1, we will use a combination of these genetic models, high-resolution
anatomy and in vivo electrophysiology conducted in behaving mice to define neural signatures for
different motor diseases. In Aim2, we will use these neural signatures as biomarkers to test the
feasibility of providing targeted close-loop cerebellar DBS to eliminate motor deficits with fast
moment-to-moment precision. The ultimate goal of this work is to reverse the behavioral outcomes of
disease by correcting brain function and restoring mobility. The availability of additional treatment
options for incurable neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases will provide alternate healthcare
considerations for reducing the impact of disease and improving the quality of life of affected patients."

Lung cancer remains the number one cancer killer in the United States and clinically useful biomarkers are
needed to improve early detection and diagnosis. The objectives of this proposal for our continuing Clinical
Validation Center are to push early lung cancer detection biomarkers into clinical practice while continuing to
serve as a core resource to the EDRN, as well as to our academic and industry partners. Our overall objective
is to demonstrate that biospecimen and imaging biomarkers will provide clinical utility to diagnose lung cancer
by reducing the number of invasive procedures performed for benign disease and the time to diagnosis for
cancer. Aim 1 will seek to demonstrate clinical utility of a combined biomarker and radiomic approach for
providing Indeterminate Pulmonary Nodule (IPN) diagnoses. We will expand the existing lung specimen and
imaging biorepository available to the scientific community, demonstrate the clinical utility of combination
biospecimen and radiomic biomarkers, and validate additional candidate lung cancer risk biomarkers. We will
diversify the population and enhance statistical power by recruiting from existing partnerships funded by prior
EDRN funding: Meharry Medical College and Washington University in St. Louis. We seek to accomplish three
objectives in this aim: 1) to validate the combined approach of hsCYFRA 21-1 cancer biomarker, radiomic
(HealthMyne) biomarker and a Histoplasmosis benign biomarker (MiraVista) in the EDRN Lung Team Project 2
and National Lung Screening Trial reference cohorts, 2) to determine the clinical utility of the Histoplasmosis test
followed by a Combined Biomarker Model (hsCYFRA21-1, radiomics, and Mayo Model) in a Phase 4 randomized
clinical trial and 3) to validate new candidate blood and epithelial biomarkers in Phase 2 and 3 prospective-
specimen-collection and retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design studies for the early diagnosis of lung
cancer. In Aim 2 we will validate radiomic risk assessment platforms in IPNs and conduct a pilot clinical
implementation trial in screening discovered IPNs. We will leverage the robust bioinformatics infrastructure at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center to capture and deidentify 800 thoracic CT scans in patients with IPNs. A
Lung Cancer Prediction Convolutional Neural Network (LCP-CNN) and the HealthMyne radiomic model will be
compared to each other and against the Lung-RADS categories. We will perform a prospective pilot evaluation
of the best performing model in Lung-RADS category 3 and 4 IPNs. To accomplish Aim 2 we will: 1) compare
the accuracy of LCP-CNN and HealthMyne radiomics 2) determine the LCP-CCN's ability to reclassify nodules
in screening patients in a prospective clinical implementation pilot study. At the completion of this proposal, we
will have 1) evaluated clinical utility of combining lung cancer biospecimen and imaging biomarkers, 2) developed
a platform within current practice to present an imaging biomarker approach to improve IPN risk assessment,
and 3) enhanced the biorepository resource for the EDRN and collaborative use."
10915479,"ABSTRACT
A defining feature of Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the presence of a host stromal response,
which is characteristically more robust (“desmoplastic”) than many solid cancers. Stromal elements, including
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the extracellular matrix, are pivotal components of the tumor
microenvironment (TME) ecosystem in PDAC, which also includes immune cells, the lymphovascular system,
and the intra-tumoral microbiome. In recent years the role of the PDAC stroma (and CAFs, in particular) has
morphed to one characterized by profound heterogeneity, plasticity, and context-specificity. The newly created
Pancreatic Cancer Stromal Reprogramming Consortium (PSRC) will fund a team of six U01 sites to conduct
basic and translational research studies on the role of the stroma and other TME constituents in PDAC
pathogenesis and outcomes. We have collated a multidisciplinary team of investigators at UT MD Anderson with
the goal of creating PASSCODE (Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stromal Reprograming ConSortium
COordination, Data Management and Education Center), that will serve as an organizing “hub” for coordination,
communication and collaboration within the PSRC, and support the newly funded U01 sites. PASSCODE will be
co-led by Dr. Anirban Maitra, an expert in PDAC pathology, genetics, and cancer biology, and Dr. J. Jack Lee,
an expert in biostatistics, clinical trial design and data science. PASSCODE proposes four aims: First, we will
support the administrative infrastructure of the PSRC, and ensure effective communication and collaboration
between consortium investigators, the NCI program office and other trans-NCI networks, including facilitating all
of the PSRC-approved in-person and virtual meetings. We will also provide operational support for material and
data transfer agreements that are germane to the collaborative studies within the PSRC. Second, we will develop
a framework for a PSRC “virtual biorepository” as a registry database for shared biospecimen access across the
consortium, and develop SOPs for processing, storage, cataloging, and distribution of annotated biospecimens
and de-identified clinical, demographic, and molecular information. Third, we will provide centralized data
management and data storage capabilities for the PSRC, with the overarching goal of data harmonization and
dissemination, within and beyond the consortium. As part of this aim, PASSCODE will provide dedicated
biostatistical and bioinformatics analytical tools, and multimodal data visualization for PSRC investigators,
including for approved collaborative projects. Fourth, PASSCODE will be responsible for developing and
maintaining both a “public facing” PSRC website and other social media outlets, as well as a secure intranet site.
We will organize seminars and workshops that highlight progress within the PSRC, and provide a platform for
educational/mentorship opportunities, especially with regards to enhancing the participation of underrepresented
minority trainees. Cumulatively, PASSCODE’s activities will be geared towards ensuring the success of the
consortium’s mission of improving PDAC survival through innovative and collaborative research endeavors."

The Population Studies Center (PSC) requests a five-year renewal of its predoctoral and postdoctoral training
program in the demography and economics of aging, funded by NIA since 1992, to build on a strong record of
producing innovative, ethical, and productive researchers, including those from backgrounds underrepresented
in these disciplines. Predoctoral trainees are drawn from Michigan's highly ranked doctoral programs in
sociology, economics, public health, and public policy. They will combine the specific doctoral requirements of
their disciplines with additional specialized training in demography through a combination of formal
coursework, informal seminars, and a research apprenticeship program grounded in PSC's rich
interdisciplinary environment. Postdoctoral scholars are researchers from a variety of social and health
sciences who benefit from focused exposure to demographic and economic approaches to aging. Most
postdoctoral trainees are recruited from other universities, and benefit from matches with a new mentors,
participation in a range of substantive, methodological, and professionalization seminars, and collaborative
research opportunities. Trainees are mentored by investigators on some of the most central data collection
projects in aging, such as the Health and Retirement Study and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, projects
that integrate biological indicators of health deterioration over the life course with data capturing the social and
economic determinants of differential aging by racial, ethnic, gender and socioeconomic groups. Our goal is to
cultivate the next generation of health scientists for careers spent integrating knowledge, theory, and tools from
economics, public health, public policy, and sociology to collect and analyze the data needed to address
pressing challenges of an aging U.S. population. The program will be co-led by Dr. Sarah Burgard, director of
the PSC and NIA-funded sociologist and epidemiologist focused on the social determinants of socioeconomic,
gender and racial/ethnic health disparities in later life, and Dr. Paula Fomby, established associate director and
training director of the PSC since 2017, and NIH-funded family demographer. The MPIs are supported by a
training committee of field coordinators from Economics/Public Policy (Dr. Dean Yang), Health Behavior and
Health Education (Dr. Arline Geronimus) and Sociology/Public Policy (Dr. Jeff Morenoff, former PSC Center
Director) all full professors and experienced mentors. Trainees will be mentored by diverse training faculty from
these and related disciplinary departments, researchers with well-funded projects and a strong record of
mentoring and placing trainees in leading academic and governmental research positions. The program will be
stewarded by the PSC, one of the oldest population centers in the United States, with a distinguished 60-year
record of domestic and international population research and training, and a leader in the demography and
economics of aging."

Currently, the Draize live rabbit eye test is the benchmark to distinguish consumer products and materials that
are safe from those that are hazardous and can cause mild, moderate, or severe ocular damage. However,
new laws are currently being, or are planned to be, implemented in California, the United States, and the
European Union to ban the use of animals for ocular irritation testing. Despite this fact, there is currently no
single nonanimal test or combination of nonanimal tests that can accurately classify all levels of ocular irritants
and corrosives. It is of particular concern that all nonanimal tests generally overpredict the least damaging
class of ocular irritants and cannot determine (or determine with low sensitivity) the most extreme class for
which they have sensitivity rates as low as 50%. More importantly, none of the currently validated alternative
tests can detect irritants that require proper safety labeling (GHS Cat. 2A) or those that cause irritation that
lasts up to 21 days but then clears without causing permanent corneal damage. This target classification
represents a critical UNMET NEED for correctly informing and advising consumers and manufacturers about
product safety. We have recently developed and tested a new method, the in vitro depth of injury eye irritation
test (IVD EIT), to detect all classes of irritants with high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this
application is to further develop the IVD EIT with the long-term goal of providing a service and/or kit for the
accurate classification of ocular irritants to meet this UNMET NEED for a nonanimal ocular irritation test to be
used to label product and chemicals and hence ensure safe handling practices.

Cerebrovascular dysfunction is emerging as a common pathology in many diseases of the brain, including
neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, as well as in aging. Therefore, understanding the role
of cerebrovascular dysfunction in disease progression and aging will be key to long-term maintenance of brain
health. With developments in tissue engineering and stem cell technology, in vitro cerebrovascular models can
play an important role in understanding the role of cerebrovascular dysfunction in disease progression and
aging.
Next-generation cerebrovascular models should take into account three key factors: (1) differences in
phenotype of brain microvascular endothelial cells along the arterio-venous axis, (intrinsic factors), (2)
differences in microenvironmental cues along the arterio-venous axis (extrinsic factors), and (3) changes in
zonation-specific cerebrovascular phenotype during aging and in response to aged serum. Therefore, the
overall goal of this project is to use zonation- and age-specific intrinsic and extrinsic cues to reverse engineer
human cerebrovascular models, and to use these models to understand cerebrovascular phenotype during
aging. We will first perform a pooled genetic screen to identify transcription factor combinations that are
capable of driving source cells towards gene expression profiles of human brain microvascular endothelial cells
along the arterio-venous axis (Aim 1). Three candidate induced brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs)
for each zone will be generated using lentiviral transduction. The top candidate for each zone will then be
selected from analysis of gene and protein expression profiles (Aim 2). We will then use the three iBMECs to
demonstrate zonation-specific cerebrovascular phenotype in zonation-specific models (arteriole, capillary,
venule) (Aim 3). Next, we will assess the influence of young and old serum on cerebrovascular phenotype in
the zonation-specific models (Aim 4). Finally, we will use the same approach to create an aged
cerebrovascular model in one zone. We will create iBMECs that match the transcription factor profile of human
brain microvascular endothelial cells in the aged cerebrovasculature, and then assess the role of
microenvironmental cues and young/old serum on cerebrovascular phenotype.
This project is a collaboration between the Searson group (JHU) with expertise in tissue-engineered
microvascular models, and the Heiman group (MIT) with expertise in genomics and molecular mechanisms of
neurodegenerative disease. This project builds upon key recent accomplishments from the two labs: (1) the
creation of a library of zonation-specific transcription factor profiles for brain microvascular endothelial cells
from the human brain, (2) identification of key transcription factors to enable reverse engineering of zonation-
specific human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and (3) tissue-engineered platforms for zonation-specific
cerebrovascular models."

 Adolescent alcohol and other drug (AOD) use is a major public health concern posing significant challenges
to healthcare providers, patients and families. It is associated with comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions,
poor educational and employment outcomes, accidents and injuries, and avoidable health services utilization
and costs (e.g., emergency and inpatient). Early AOD use initiation is associated with alcohol use disorders in
adulthood. Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) delivered in pediatric primary care
is an effective approach to early identification and intervention and can reduce both AOD use and consequences
and co-occurring mental health symptoms, yet widespread implementation is lacking, due to a variety of barriers,
including the time constraints and competing priorities faced by pediatricians and lack of trained staff. Research
on efficient and cost-effective modalities of SBIRT delivery in pediatric primary care is critical to expanding the
evidence base and supporting broader implementation. Accelerated by the pandemic, behavioral telemedicine
approaches to addressing adolescent AOD use and mental health problems are gaining momentum and offer the
potential to increase the reach and impact of SBIRT in pediatric primary care. This study’s objective is to examine
whether a centralized, virtually delivered modality of SBIRT, rapidly accessible by multiple pediatric primary
care clinics, can be cost-effectively implemented to improve early identification and treatment for AOD and
comorbid mental health problems among adolescents at high or severe risk of AOD use disorder . In this wholly
pragmatic, Type 1 Hybrid Comparative Effectiveness Implementation trial, set in a large, real-world health
system with a highly diverse population, we will randomize 20 busy, general pediatric primary care clinics with
an eligible population of approximately 22,320 12-17 year old adolescents, to one of two intervention arms: 1)
clinics where brief interventions are delivered virtually by video or telephone by a centralized behavioral health
clinician (CV-SBIRT arm), or 2) clinics where appointment-based brief interventions are delivered by a
behavioral health clinician assigned to the clinic (Traditional SBIRT arm). Licensed behavioral health
clinicians in both arms will be trained in the same empirically supported SBIRT protocol, differing only in its
modality of delivery. The sample will include all adolescents aged 12 through 17 years seen for a Well Visit, who
are at high or severe risk of AOD use disorder defined as endorsing monthly or more frequent AOD use OR any
AOD use and past-two-week depressive symptoms or suicidality. We will use administrative and clinical data
collected in the electronic health record during routine care to compare SBIRT implementation (rates of brief
interventions and referrals), AOD and mental health outcomes (use frequency and symptom endorsement and
diagnoses), specialty Addiction Medicine and Psychiatry treatment initiation and engagement, health services
use (inpatient and Emergency Department), and cost-effectiveness in the intervention arms, at 1 and 2 years
post-screening."
10911287,"Project Summary
Mobile element insertions (MEIs), or transposable elements, have been established to contribute to ongoing
mutagenesis of the human genome, leading to widespread variability and sporadic cases of human disease.
Recent work has begun to illuminate underlying roles through which MEIs affect regulatory processes through
their combined effects on transcription factor binding and 3D chromatin looping. Recent work from our group has
demonstrated the importance of MEIs in establishing chromatin looping variability in driving differential gene
expression. These observations have precipitated development of molecular and computational approaches to
study their impact on human biology, including whole-genome and target-capture strategies leveraging short-
read sequencing technologies. However, these methods fail to accurately capture the entire landscape of MEIs
within the human genome because of their limited ability to identify non-reference polymorphic MEIs. This failure
derives in part from a blind-spot of short-read genome sequencing: because the human genome harbors over 1
million MEIs, unambiguous alignment of short reads is problematic. Given the demonstrated importance of MEIs
to human biology and evolution, it is imperative that novel methods capable of comprehensively mapping their
locations across many human genomes be developed. In this proposal we aim to 1) Quantify the effects of TE
activity on CTCF binding in a human population sample of 51 well-studied individuals using computational meth-
ods, 2) Map invariant and polymorphic LTR13 insertions in the CEU population and investigate their effects on
intraspecies variability in CTCF binding, chromatin looping, and gene regulation, and 3) Directly map
HARVK/LTR13-anchored chromatin loops through enrichment-capture combined with ONT-based chromatin
conformation capture sequencing. We expect completion of these aims to yield the following outcomes: We will:
1) Present the first reliable estimate of the contribution of polymorphic MEIs to CTCF-mediated chromatin looping
variation in a human population. 2) Improve understanding of how fixed and polymorphic MEIs contribute to
population-level variability in regulatory activity, gene expression, and disease risk. 3) Demonstrate causality of
ongoing MEI activity regarding population-level looping variation and differential gene expression. The new meth-
ods proposed here will address the shortcomings of existing short-read sequencing technologies, allowing us to
comprehensively and cost-effectively map target MEIs across a broad population sample, bridging important
gaps in our knowledge of how gene regulatory processes evolve in the human genome."
10909666,"Of all the poisoning syndromes associated with harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins, ciguatera poisoning (CP) is
the most prevalent globally and is estimated to afflict tens of thousands of people each year, with many cases
unreported. CP is primarily caused by the consumption of reef fish (and some invertebrates) contaminated with
toxins that originate from species of the (sub)tropical benthic/epiphytic dinoflagellate genera Gambierdiscus and
Fukuyoa (hereafter referred to together as Gambierdiscus). CP is predicted to increase in geographic range and
frequency in the Greater Caribbean region (GCR) and elsewhere in response to climate change. We established
the Greater Caribbean Center for Ciguatera Research (GCCCR) through the Centers of Oceans and Human
Health (COHH3) program to study the anticipated intensification of CP in the GCR due to warming sea surface
temperatures and reef degradation associated with climate change. The major goals of GCCCR in COHH3 are
to: 1) examine the role climate change may play in the geographic and temporal expansion of ciguatera poisoning
(CP) into more temperate latitudes (Research Project 1); 2) obtain a better understanding of the toxic metabolites
produced by certain Gambierdiscus strains, and the subsequent transfer and biotransformation of these
compounds into coastal/reef food webs (Research Project 2); 3) study the genotoxicity and impacts on cellular
metabolism caused by these toxins upon exposure (Research Project 3), in order to 4) better protect and treat
people from this malady by translating the above scientific findings into risk-based outputs for engagement and
education activities for the community in the Greater Caribbean Region (Community Engagement Core). While
the GCCCR has been productive to date, Hurricane Ian severely hindered progress, particularly in Florida and
specifically at FGCU. Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida (near FGCU) on September 28, 2022.
The 10’+ storm surge caused significant damage to our coasts, including the FGCU Vester Field Station in Bonita
Springs, Florida. This damage has rendered Vester inoperable to date. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, PD
Parsons had to spend considerable time and effort coordinating clean-up and repairs. Additionally, adjusting
our research activities has been challenging (no dock access; damaged boats; inaccessible sampling sites).
While repairs are underway, we have lost considerable time (and resources), hindering our progress and ability
to complete our remaining tasks in the COHH3 project of GCCCR. We have identified specific tasks that were
most impacted by Hurricane Ian and form the basis for our request for a Funded Extension of the GCCCR
project: COHH3 Research Project 1 (Specific Aim 3), Research Project 2 (Specific Aim 1), and the Community
Engagement Core (Specific Aim 3)."
10909556,"Project Summary/Abstract
In development, the embryo generates many cell types with distinct gene expression programs, leading to
heterogeneity across cells. In cancer, mutation generates heterogeneity, with a growing recognition that non-
genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms contribute to tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure. The ability to take the
same genetic template and form different cell states, exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in gene expression and
behavior, is fundamental to many cell systems across problems in human health including stem cells, cancer,
and immune cell function. Yet, the mechanisms by which cell systems encode heterogeneity in gene expression
are unclear. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells give rise to all the cells of the adult mammal, and primary
embryonic stem cells are genetically stable in culture, making them an ideal system for studying the emergence
of non-genetic heterogeneity in cell systems. Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression that arises in the absence
of environmental signals has previously been termed `noise', or attributed to stochastic processes of gene
expression. However, gene expression heterogeneity is reproducible, suggesting regulation. The goal of this
proposal is to identify regulatory mechanisms by which the genome encodes non-genetic heterogeneity in cell
systems. We will use embryonic stem cells as a model system for gene expression heterogeneity. First, we will
identify transcription factor pairs whose combined activity at enhancers leads to transcriptional heterogeneity of
the regulated gene. In order for heterogeneity to result in forming distinct states with the potential to prime stem
cells into different lineages, heterogeneity must be heritable. Second, using a modified Luria-Delbruck fluctuation
analysis, we will identify memory loci capable of heritable transmission of non-genetic heterogeneity across cell
generations. Motifs such as autoregulation, whereby a gene's product can regulate its own production, may
contribute to the formation of different cell states and therefore to heterogeneity across a cell population. Third,
we will manipulate a single factor within or outside of an autoregulatory loop to determine how it impacts
heterogeneity. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage an assay we have developed which allows the
identification of actively transcribed regulatory regions and genes in small subsets of cells. Completion of these
goals will address longstanding questions about the origins of heterogeneity in cell systems and will advance a
systems level approach for understanding cell state. If successful, the proposal may unlock future studies
applying similar approaches to identify non-genetic drivers of tumor heterogeneity and treatment failure.
Therapeutic targeting of these mechanisms may unlock new treatment strategies for cancer."
10930168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Proportional reasoning is a critical skill, both for every day decision making, such as evaluating financial and
medical risk, and for academic achievement. Prior work reveals that proportional reasoning varies across two
critical dimensions: (1) the type of quantity on which the proportion is based and (2) development. In particular,
children and adults are worse at proportional reasoning when the proportion is based on discrete number (e.g.,
the proportion of M&Ms that are red) versus continuous amount (e.g., proportion of juice that is just water).
Furthermore, error-prone performance with discrete proportion in particular may vary developmentally, with
infants and young children being less error-prone than older children and adults. However, little is known about
the shared cognitive mechanisms that underly proportional reasoning and how these mechanisms may vary
across contexts and development. The current proposal aims to address this critical gap. The proposed project
will identify which cognitive mechanisms are independent of the specific type of quantitative context, and thus
underly proportional reasoning more generally, and which mechanisms are unique to the specific type of
quantity at hand. Using a developmental and computational approach, the Specific Aims target three distinct
possible mechanisms that may differ across discrete and continuous proportion: cognitive representations (Aim
1), cognitive processes (Aim 2), and symbolic strategies (Aim 2). This approach will provide novel theoretical
insight into the cognitive mechanisms that underly proportional reasoning across contexts and development, as
well as how these mechanisms can be leveraged to support proportional reasoning more generally (Aim 3).
During the K-Phase of the project, the candidate will characterize the precision with which infants, children, and
adults represent proportional information, and how it differs in discrete and continuous contexts (Aim 1). Using
a computational modeling approach, Aim 2 will test formal mathematical models of cognitive processes that
could explain the behavioral patterns found in Aim 1. During the R-Phase, Aim 2 will also test the often-reported
but largely untested hypothesis that people use symbolic number strategies with discrete, but not continuous,
proportion. Lastly, Aim 3 will leverage insights about specific cognitive mechanisms gained in the prior aims to
test novel predictions about how to support both young children’s proportional reasoning and probabilistic
decision making in adults (Study 5).
A long-term goal of the candidate is to develop a Theory of Proportion that explains behavior across a range of
contexts and across development. The mentored phase will take place in the University of Chicago’s Psychology
Department and the proposed training in theory-building, infant methods (Aim 1), and computational modeling
approaches (Aim 2) will put the candidate in an excellent position to become a methodological and theoretical
leader in the field of cognitive development."
10922833,"Transgender women (TGW), particularly young TGW (ages 18-29), are among the fastest growing HIV+
populations worldwide with HIV prevalence rates of 15-28%. Thailand has the highest adult HIV
seroprevalence in Asia, with high prevalence rates of HIV infection among TGW (18%). Despite their risk, few
interventions have targeted young TGW. Effective developmentally- and culturally-tailored interventions are
needed to prevent HIV transmission in this high-risk population. Widespread technology offers opportunities
for innovative mobile (mHealth) interventions. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an efficacious HIV
prevention strategy recommended by the CDC and WHO for at-risk individuals, including HIV-negative TGW.
PrEP is highly effective when taken as prescribed, but PrEP uptake and adherence have been low, with high
discontinuation rates among TGW. To address these challenges, we propose to develop and pilot a multi-
component, technology-based intervention to promote PrEP usage. We will adapt an existing two-session,
technology-delivered, Motivational Interviewing intervention to focus on PrEP use in young Thai TGW,
resulting in the Motivational Enhancement System for PrEP Uptake and Adherence (MES-PrEP). We will also
refine and enhance “YaCool,” a mobile app with integrated text messaging developed and used clinically by our
Thai team, to develop “enhanced YaCool” for TGW self-management of gender/sexual health (including PrEP).
Our primary aim is to develop and assess preliminary efficacy of the resulting mHealth intervention. We will
utilize a Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to identify the most effective intervention component or
combination of components to address PrEP usage in this population. The proposed study includes 2 phases
corresponding to the R21 and R33 study periods. Phase IA (R21) includes qualitative interviews with key
stakeholders to explore barriers and facilitators of PrEP usage through thematic analysis to inform intervention
adaptation. Phase IB (R21) consists of adapting and beta testing of MES-PrEP and enhanced YaCool for
functionality and feasibility using a community advisory board of HIV-negative Thai TGW. In Phase II (R33),
we will conduct a MOST design-based trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
MES-PrEP and YaCool. Eighty HIV-negative young TGW who are on PrEP and 80 young TGW who are not
starting PrEP will be randomized to four experimental conditions: 1) Standard PrEP Counseling (SPC, control),
2) MES-PrEP + SPC, 3) enhanced YaCool + SPC, and 4) MES-PrEP + enhanced YaCool + SPC. Feasibility and
acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through usage patterns and the System Usability Scale.
Preliminary impact will be assessed by evaluating the proportion of PrEP initiation and level of adherence to
PrEP. TGW will complete assessments at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-intervention. Biomarkers
of adherence to PrEP and HIV/STI will be collected. Upon project completion, we will have an optimized
mHealth intervention to support TGW using PrEP which will be ready for testing in a larger efficacy trial."
10912690,"Opioid drugs are essential medications for the relief of serious pain, with no substitutes currently available for
postsurgical and other severe indications. Long term use of opioids, however, leads to numerous side effects,
and to substantial risk of substance use disorder (SUD). SUD or “addiction” is diagnosed based on behavioral
characteristics that manifest broadly as loss of control or “compulsive” drug seeking and impaired decision making
or “cognitive flexibility” even after months to years of abstinence. However, the majority of preclinical research
of drug abuse focuses on models of drug-taking and reward-seeking rather than on the long-lasting changes in
behavioral flexibility that underlie human SUDs. In addition, preclinical studies of SUD mechanism have been
limited to comparing animals that have or have not taken drug. This has made it difficult to dissociate opioid-
induced changes in biology and behavior that occur merely due to drug exposure from those that actually underlie
the pathology of a SUD. We have developed a unique tool to circumvent this significant confound in opioid abuse
research. Specifically, we have developed a knock-in mouse that expresses a modified mu opioid receptor
(MOR) with altered signaling properties. The MOR when activated by its endogenous ligands, endorphins and
enkephalins, engages G protein signaling to control neuronal activity. Following G protein activation by
endogenous ligand, most G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), including the MOR, then rapidly recruit arrestins
that silence the G protein signal and promote receptor endocytosis and, for the MOR, rapid recycling. This
mechanism thereby carefully titrates G protein signal with a precision and time course ideally suited to respond
to transmitters that are released in a pulsatile manner. In contrast, MORs activated by morphine and all its
derivates effectively engage G protein signaling but poorly engage arrestins. In the current vernacular of GPCR
pharmacology, morphine is termed a “biased” agonist, signaling preferentially to G protein over arrestins while
endorphins are “balanced” agonists, engaging both G proteins and arrestins. The RMOR receptor was
engineered to effectively engage both G protein and arrestin when activated by morphine without altering
signaling in response to endogenous transmitters. Importantly, in our extensive previous work, we have found
that RMOR mice do not develop tolerance or dependence to morphine nor do they transition to compulsive drug
seeking in a model of SUD under conditions where wild type (WT) mice do. More recently, we have found while
morphine causes long-lasting changes in cognitive flexibility in WT mice, this effect is also absent in RMOR mice.
Here we will use WT and RMOR mice to pinpoint molecular and synaptic mechanisms that underlie SUDs in a
paradigm where all mice receive drug but only WT show pathologic morphine responses. We propose that any
morphine-induced changes that occur in both genotypes is likely to reflect a response to drug exposure, whereas
changes confined to WT mice likely contribute to the pathology of SUDs."

10913291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding selection in complex evolving populations is a common theme across the biomedical sciences.
Examples include the characterization of driver mutations that lead to cancer, pathogen evolution to escape
human immune responses, and the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recent experimental advances have
substantially increased the availability of temporal genetic data, which could be exploited to detect selection with
greater accuracy and precision. However, inferring selection from temporal genetic data remains technically
challenging. The central goal of my research is to develop and apply efficient computational and statistical
methods to quantitatively describe evolutionary dynamics, including the role of selection in evolution. Drawing
on novel approaches derived from statistical physics, we will develop robust, scalable, and interpretable methods
to infer the fitness effects of mutations from temporal genetic data, accounting for features such as genetic
linkage, epistasis, and time-varying selection. These methods will be integrated into a software package in order
to make them more widely accessible to the community. We will focus on two specific applications: 1)
investigating the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 to evade adaptive immune responses, a
prototypical example of rapid and complex evolution, and 2) interpreting massively parallel assays of protein
function. Our research program will create new tools for understanding complex evolving populations and apply
them to elucidate host-pathogen coevolutionary dynamics and to improve widely used high-throughput

10913522,"Delineating epigenetic coordination of regenerative tissue plasticity
Abstract: Tissue damage and repair represent fundamental problems in human health for which few
pharmacological interventions are available. In stratified epithelium, regeneration involves the integration of
complex molecular networks at both the single cell and tissue-scale level. These networks largely consist of
epigenetic modifiers that function to direct cell state plasticity and lineage fate in response to injury. Such
changes must also be integrated with intraepithelial tissue-resident immunity for full tissue regeneration.
Despite progress in understanding the cellular pathways that mediate epithelial renewal, there is a significant
gap in understanding how the distinct epigenetic states of various epithelial cell subtypes cooperate with
tissue-resident immune cells to mediate a tissue-scale restorative response. This gap considerably limits our
ability to design therapeutic strategies for a broad range of human diseases including wound healing, lung
diseases, tissue fibrosis, cancer, and immune disorders. The aim of my research is to functionally understand
the basic epigenetic modifiers that govern epithelial-immune cross talk during tissue regeneration, and how
these modifiers contribute to the orchestration of multiple epithelial lineages across the regenerating stratified
epithelium. Toward this aim, I have developed a novel in vivo gene editing platform to simultaneously
manipulate and interrogate district epithelial cell lineages. I employ this tool for high resolution functional
dissection of the epigenetic networks operating to mediate immune-epithelial cross-talks during regenerative
healing. The accessibility of the skin and tongue epidermis, and the abundance of tissue-resident immune cells
in these tissues, makes them ideal model systems for these studies. Dr. Matthew Ramsey’s laboratory and
mentorship provides an excellent environment for me to gain experience in sophisticated in vivo tissue stem
cell techniques, and in to acquire the necessary mentoring skills necessary to transition to independence. Co-
mentorship by Dr. Tomas Kupper, an established expert in epithelial tissue-resident T cell immunology, will
provide me with the exceptional epithelial tissue-resident immunology training necessary to establish an
independent research program distinct from my mentors. My career development plan integrates additional
laboratory training, specialized course in epigenetics, immunology, and large-data analysis at the world-class
environment of Harvard Medical School. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have
assembled an Advisory Committee composed of a team of established experts and ongoing collaborators. I
have equally designed a tailored diversity and inclusion training plan outlining objectives to attain during the
K99 phase. The proposed studies and mentoring plans described in this proposal will provide me with a robust
training platform to launch my independent academic research career."
10913305,"ABSTRACT
This is a renewal application for our T32 Proteogenomics of Cancer Training Program (PCTP) at the
University of Michigan. The National Cancer Institute has made substantial investments in new technology
platforms for cancer proteomics, most recently through the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium
(CPTAC). The proteome is critical to understanding functional genomics and systems biology of cancers
and to discovery and validation of biomarker candidates and molecular targets for therapy and prevention.
Sophisticated analysis of proteomes requires advanced informatics to deal with the complexity of
specimens, the extreme dynamic range of protein concentrations, post-translational modifications,
alternative splice isoforms, responses to all sorts of perturbations, and differences in databases and data
formats. Furthermore, integrative proteogenomics analysis of data generated using multiple omics
technologies (proteomics, genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc.) has emerged as a powerful
approach for reconstructing targetable pathways in cancer. The main goal of PCTP is to address the current
scarcity of scientists able to effectively generate and bioinformaticly analyze their own proteomics data, to
take advantage of CPTAC and other publicly available large-scale proteomics datasets, and to perform
multi-level proteogenomics data integration. PCTP is a truly multi-disciplinary Training Program that is also
very unique, with the U of M and nationally. Anchored in the university-wide Center for Computational
Medicine and Bioinformatics, it provides an opportunity to students from diverse backgrounds to become
well skilled in all PCTP focus areas - cancer biology, proteomics, bioinformatics, and proteogenomics.
PCTP is requesting 7 slots/year to supports pre-doctoral trainees for 1-2 years. We have a robust
community of cancer researchers, bioinformaticians, data scientists, statisticians, and chemists. Our faculty
and students are in the leadership of Human Proteome Organization initiatives, development and global
deployment of data repositories and data analysis systems, and creation of new algorithms for proteome
bioinformatics and multi-omics data integration. Our trainees come from larger Graduate Programs within
the U of M (including Bioinformatics, Pathology, Cancer Biology, Chemistry, and Biomedical Engineering)
and receive training in cancer biology, bioinformatics, and proteomics through courses, seminars, and
special workshops. PCTP strongly encourages dual mentorship of each trainee by a cancer researcher and
a computational scientist. We will further strengthen our Training Program with an addition of a special
Annual Workshop for our T32 trainees on Proteogenomics Data Analysis, taking advantage of our Faculty’s
engagement in the efforts of the CPTAC consortium. In summary, our ongoing NCI training program in
Proteogenomics of Cancer trains a new generation of scientists well prepared for an independent career in
interdisciplinary biomedical research, enhances faculty research, and supports NCI goals."
10913307,"Nature has provided not only a synthetic machinery that can be used to accelerate the development of medicines
(our long-term goal) but also a plethora of examples for how this machinery synthesizes medicines. However,
the potential of polyketide assembly lines remains virtually untapped by medicinal chemistry. Beyond
manipulating the DNA encoding these synthases and identifying suitable heterologous hosts, an incorrect
understanding of the logic of these molecule factories has thwarted their engineering. Over the last several years,
bioinformatic evidence has mounted that the modular unit recombined during assembly line evolution differs from
the traditional polyketide synthase module that most scientists employ in their designs. Our lab has helped
redefine the module such that a gatekeeping ketosynthase (KS) domain is at its most downstream position and
has demonstrated that synthases designed with the updated boundary outperform those designed with the
traditional boundary. After many design-build-test cycles, we are now able to rapidly engineer pentaketide
synthases that produce preparative levels of stereochemically-dense polyketides from E. coli. Our lab is
positioned to further our knowledge of assembly line logic as we engineer assembly lines that generate
medicinally-relevant products. Through Specific Aim 1 (the bottom-up approach) we will push the substrate
tolerance limits of KSs, asking them to accept intermediates with substituents beyond the b-carbon that differ
from those they naturally accept. Through 3 ligations with DNA encoding 5 pikromycin modules, 125 pentaketide
synthases will be constructed. Mass spectrometry methods, including imaging, will quickly identify struggling
synthases. Guided by a bioinformatics/structural study of KS gatekeeping recently completed in our lab, we will
predict what mutations will remove bottlenecks in these assembly lines. Gain-in-function mutants will inform
future engineering. Through Specific Aim 2 (the top-down approach) pikromycin modules will be combined
through 4 ligations to yield 100 heptaketide synthases. The products will be similar to narbonolide, the product
of the pikromycin synthase, but with differing combinations of ketide units at the second, third, fifth, and sixth
positions. After optimizing synthases as in the first aim, desosamine biosynthesis/transfer genes will be supplied
to generate narbomycin analogs. As from the seminal, modular syntheses of macrolides performed by the
Andrew Myers lab, we anticipate discovering several new macrolide antibiotics. In Specific Aim 3 (the horizontal
approach) a library of 32 hybrid pentaketide synthases will be constructed using modules from the pikromycin
and spinosyn assembly lines. We hypothesize that many of these will be inactive due to incompatibilities between
KS and acyl carrier protein (ACP) domains at intermodular junctions. An interface repeatedly identified by
docking servers for cognate KS and ACP domains will guide KS surface mutations to restore function to inactive
synthases. We seek to identify a set of mutations that permit the docking of diverse ACPs, thus facilitating the
recombination of all modules and providing access to as much polyketide chemical space as possible."
10914094,"Project Summary. The RETCC has played a coordinating role in the success of ULSRC since its inception in
September 2017. By working closely with other NIEHS-supported training programs at the UofL (T32ES011564;
T35ES014559), the RETCC has developed a rich, diverse, and comprehensive training program that is both
multidisciplinary and inclusive. In addition to the course work and ‘on the bench’ training activities, RETCC
routinely organizes participatory field trips to the Lee’s Lane Superfund site to better understand and appreciate
health concerns of residents in the adjacent community of Riverside Gardens; facilitates the meeting of trainees
with regional Superfund site coordinators and officials and the Metro Louisville Public Health and Wellness
Department. Our training core in collaboration with Superfund Research Centers at Duke University, University
of Kentucky, and University of Pennsylvania organized a trip to Washington, D.C. so trainees could attend a
Science and Policy Institute meeting that included interactions with congressional leaders and their staff. Such
activities have been instrumental in the well-rounded growth of our trainees. Moreover, these trainees not only
provide “the force that turns the wheel” but also are the focus and hub of intellectual crosstalk and fertilization
across projects, cores, other SRCs and the National SRP. To date, ULSRC success is the product of our trainees’
successes through their many accomplishments including publications, presentations, awards, degrees,
fellowships, interactions with community partners, and environmental health sciences-related career
opportunities. Thus, although we are proud of our current success via integration of trainee activities across the
ULSRC, we continue to strive to build on these successes by implementing innovative and unifying features into
RETCC-directed activities that focus on fulfilling the goals and furthering the success of our trainees."
10914074,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Immunotherapies that enhance the ability of T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells have been transformational
in the treatment of human cancer, but immunotherapy is not effective in all patients or cancers, and therefore
studies interrogating the molecular basis for durable T cell responses to cancer are needed. A critical barrier for
the sustained activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells is the development of T cell ‘exhaustion,’ which leads to the
stable expression of inhibitory surface receptors, poor response to tumor antigens, and low cell proliferation and
persistence of T cells in vivo. However, to date, it has been difficult to study the gene regulatory mechanisms
that control the development of T cell exhaustion in humans, due to a lack of sensitive genomic tools to study
primary immune cells from patients. We recently developed a suite of high-throughput epigenomic technologies
that enable the measurement of three-dimensional (3D) genome conformation and single-cell chromatin
accessibility in primary T cells from human tumors. In the proposed research, we aim to utilize these methods to
identify changes in 4D nucleome (4DN) organization and accessibility that underlie the development of human
T cell exhaustion. In Aim 1, we will define 3D genome interactions that occur in human T cell exhaustion in
patients with advanced skin cancer. Exhaustion-associated genome conformation will be compared across
several cancer types to identify a consensus exhaustion profile, and these findings will be integrated with
chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to identify transcriptional effects of 3D changes. In Aim 2, we
will determine the dynamics and reversibility of regulatory 3D interactions in exhaustion using a novel chimeric
antigen-receptor (CAR)-T cell model. In Aim 3, we will perturb these interactions using CRISPR/Cas9 genome
editing in primary T cells, coupled with single-cell epigenomic read-outs, to engineer improved, durable, next-
generation immunotherapies. If successful, these findings will have a direct impact on the future design of
immunotherapy strategies, which will have a significant impact on the clinical care of cancer patients. Finally, we
will facilitate the dissemination of these findings by freely distributing protocols and data and releasing custom
software tools, and we will use these studies as a collaborative launch point in the 4DN network. We anticipate
that these results will lead to novel insights into the molecular regulation of T cell exhaustion and serve as an
effective research program for Dr. Satpathy to establish his independent laboratory at the interface of
immunology and genome science."
10914075,"Pervasive health disparities affecting U.S. Black women are now widely recognized, but large gaps in
knowledge remain. We began the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS) in 1995 to identify reasons for
disparities, including cancer health disparities; at that time Black women represented a very small proportion of
participants in observational cohort studies. We enrolled 59,000 participants over an 8-month period in 1995
via a lengthy mail questionnaire. Subsequently, participants were asked to complete follow-up questionnaires,
usually four pages in length, every two years, either on paper or online. In the most recent questionnaire cycle,
responses were split equally between the two methods. Over 51,000 participants are still alive and response
rates continue to be good. Among approximately 48,000 who were sent a 2019/20 questionnaire, 71%
completed it and 79% responded to either that questionnaire or the prior one. Saliva samples as a source of
germline and microbial DNA have been obtained and stored for 27,800 participants and blood samples for
13,030 participants. Breast tumor samples have been obtained for over 1,000 breast cancer cases; tumor
tissue collection was begun in the most recent funding period for four other cancers. BWHS research covers
the spectrum from individual behaviors, medication use, and other characteristics, to psychosocial factors,
genetic factors, and neighborhood-level factors. Peer-reviewed publications have addressed a range of health
conditions: cancers that include breast, lung, ovarian, colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, liver, and multiple
myeloma; type 2 diabetes; obesity; lupus; sarcoidosis; preterm birth; infertility; uterine leiomyoma; cognitive
decline; sleep disorders; hypertension; COVID-19 infection; and mortality. More than half of current participants
are under age 64, affording the potential for additional research on cancer etiology, including with collection of
new or repeated exposures and covariates. During the next funding period, we expect to produce impactful
findings with regard to risk of multiple myeloma and colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancer; breast and
colorectal cancer survivorship; cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease; end-stage renal disease; and other
conditions, such as COVID-19, that disproportionately affect Black women. (According to the National Death
Index (NDI), over 100 BWHS participants died from COVID-19 infection in 2020.) To reduce costs, we will
reduce the frequency of questionnaires while still linking to NDI, Medicare, and cancer registries to identify and
confirm new cancers, other illnesses, and deaths. We will continue to share BWHS data and samples with
outside investigators, and underrepresented minority investigators in particular, and will modernize our website
and data sharing systems to increase accessibility. Continued follow-up of this landmark study is critical to
inform opportunities for risk reduction in a vulnerable population and to close the gap in racial disparities in
cancer and other illnesses."
10914076,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are approximately 4 million breast cancer survivors (BCS) in the U.S., and this population is expected to
increase by 1 million in the next ten years. Increased moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is
consistently associated with reductions in treatment-related side effects, cancer recurrence and mortality, and
increased QOL in BCS. Yet, the majority of BCS (~70%) do not meet MVPA recommendations (i.e., 150
mins/week). Existing studies of MVPA in BCS are largely resource-intensive, costly, and deliver multiple
components (i.e., coaching calls, supervised exercise) simultaneously limiting scalability. Three evidence-
based strategies have been identified that may be particularly useful for overcoming these barriers and
increasing MVPA in BCS: 1) electronic delivery of a MVPA program, 2) social support, and 3) mindfulness
training. However, little is known about the unique roles of social support and mindfulness in MVPA promotion.
More granular information about the discrete effects of these components is needed to optimize intervention
configuration in order to maximize an effective and scalable MVPA program for BCS. The purpose of this study
is to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), to determine which types of social support and
mindfulness training intervention components optimally increase and maintain MVPA in a 6-month mHealth
MVPA intervention with a 6-month follow-up. MOST is a framework adapted from engineering that uses highly
efficient factorial experiments to evaluate individual, and combined, effects of intervention components to
determine which ones can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced to improve efficiency. Inactive BCS (n=304) will
receive a core intervention consisting of the FIt2ThriveMIND app and Fitbit and be randomly assigned to four
components under consideration for inclusion in the optimized intervention: 1) general mindfulness training; 2)
MVPA-specific mindfulness training; 3) text-coaching; and 4) engagement of a buddy. We will also examine the
effects of increasing MVPA on symptom burden, other intensity activities (i.e. light and sedentary), and sleep
quality and duration and potential mediators and moderators of component effects. All components with have a
6-month duration except text coaching which will include “boosters” personalized to an individual's MVPA goal-
attainment during the 6-month follow-up period. The proposed study represents the first systematic effort to
use MOST to design an optimized, scalable mHealth MVPA intervention in BCS that incorporates mindfulness
and specifically tests a maintenance strategy. Knowledge gained from this study will inform the development of
more effective and scalable interventions to improve health and disease outcomes among BCS. This study will
lead to an improved understanding of how to effectively change and maintain BCS' MVPA and inform the
development of more effective and scalable interventions to improve health and disease outcomes among
BCS."
10914756,"This SPiRE proposal is aimed at evaluating the feasibility of a novel interventional approach to
facilitate urinary bladder function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in a rat model. SCI
results in permanent loss of motor and autonomic function (bladder, bowel, and sexual
functions) below the level of the lesion due to limited intrinsic healing capacity and the absence
of effective therapeutic interventions. SCI involves complex pathophysiology that presents
multiple barriers to functional recovery. Despite significant research progress around
locomotion, profound SCI-related alterations in autonomic functions have not received a
proportional level of scientific urgency. Rehabilitation of these autonomic functions is an
understudied field with great relevance to Veterans as successful interventional therapies
would significantly improve their quality of life (QOL). There is thus an urgent need to assess the
feasibility of new interventions capable of synergistically improving autonomic functional
recovery. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of such interventions in a rat
model of severe SCI. Our proposal is focused on using principles of regenerative medicine
(using neural progenitor cell; NPC graft) in combination with neuromodulation (using trans-
spinal magnetic stimulation; TSMS) to provide neuroprotection and promote functional recovery
by a synergistic effect in this SCI rat model. Aim 1 will characterize the impact of three different
types of SCI that affect urogenital circuits and bladder function recovery. Aim 2 will evaluate
if NPC grafts can promote supraspinal (pontine micturition center; PMC) axon regeneration and
relay PMC signal into the spinal cord below the injury. In addition, we will assess if
neuromodulation using TSMS could strengthen and stabilize the functional connectivity of
injured spinal neurons that control bladder function. The proposed work is innovative because it
proposes a novel interventional approach capable of synergistically improving the survival and
growth of injured neural cells and facilitating neuronal functional connectivity, as well as
reducing ischemia and inflammation. This collaborative research will be led and performed by
experts in the fields of SCI and Urology, and the overarching goal of this research is to benefit
Veterans with SCI."
10916322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal seeks to further develop and validate a cell-size-based MR imaging method dubbed
MRI-cytometry as a novel approach for imaging tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and to evaluate its
potential as a surrogate imaging biomarker to predict treatment response to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB)
immunotherapy. ICB is the most widespread class of immunotherapies but it poses a new challenge to assess
tumor therapeutic response. ICB induces infiltrations of TILs into tumors to kill cancer, but such increased
numbers of TILs may lead to transient tumor enlargement, which is the current indicator of tumor progression i.e.,
non-responders. Therefore, effective response to ICB could be misdiagnosed as tumor progression i.e.,
pseudo-progression. There is often a much longer waiting period than conventional treatments to verify the
persistence of tumor volume changes, which prevents timely adjustments of treatment plans particularly in
non-responder patients, causing unwanted treatment delays, costs, and risks of toxicity. Current mainstream
imaging methods require exogenous agents for labeling TILs, which significantly increases cost and risks of
toxicity. To overcome these limitations, this application proposes a novel, exogenous-agent-free approach for
imaging TILs. Because lymphocytes (5-10 μm in diameter with and without activation) are significantly smaller
than most cancer cells (10-20 µm), cell size could be used as an endogenous contrast to distinguish “small” TILs
from “large” cancer cells. The significantly increased TILs are expected to cause some unique microstructural
changes e.g., decreased mean cell sizes and increased cell fractions of “small” cells. To detect these changes,
we recently developed a cell-size-based MRI method dubbed MRI-cytometry for imaging cell size distribution
and intracellular volume fractions in vivo. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that MRI-cytometry can
serve as a specific imaging biomarker of TILs, and hence can predict treatment response to ICB immunotherapy.
To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: Aim 1 [development]: To further develop MRI-cytometry
imaging to overcome potentially confounding effects for accurate estimation of microstructural parameters. Aim 2
[validation]: To validate MRI-cytometry imaging to characterize lymphocyte infiltration following ICB
immunotherapy using preclinical animal models. Aim 3 [evaluation]: To evaluate MRI-cytometry to predict tumor
response to combinations of ICB immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Successful completion of this project will
establish a new exogenous-agent-free MRI tool for imaging tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes following
immune-checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. It can be used as an “add-on” to clinical MRI to reduce cost and
risks of toxicity compared with those lymphocyte labeling methods. Moreover, the proposed approach is
expected to be translated to the clinic easily, allowing clinicians to stratify responder and non-responder patients
early to adjust treatment plans in the manner of personalized medicine."

 Many infants exposed to opioids antenatally develop Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
(NOWS). The overarching goal of the HEAL Initiative: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
Pharmacological Treatments Comparative Effectiveness Trial – Clinical Sites (UG1 Clinical Trial
Required) as stated in RFA-HD-21-031 is to design and implement a multi-center, comparative
effectiveness, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the optimal pharmacological treatment
for NOWS. Our clinical site at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is a Regional Perinatal
Center with a Comprehensive Addiction in Pregnancy Program (CAPP) that can enroll a large cohort of
infants with NOWS. UAB is also actively enrolling in the UAB Outcomes of Babies with Opioid Exposure
(OBOE) in response to HEAL Initiative: Antenatal Opioid Exposure Longitudinal Study Consortium (RFA-
HD-19-025) and the ACT NOW Weaning study. As a center in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network
(NRN) for >25 years, our clinical site has long-standing established productive collaborations with many
other clinical centers. Our center has an excellent track record of enrollment in clinical studies (#1 or 2 in
most NRN trials) with successful follow-up to 2 years of age and beyond, with trained certified examiners
for neurodevelopment. Our investigational pharmacy has worked with us on multiple trials. Therefore,
there is demonstrated adequacy of clinical, administrative and data organizational management facilities.
For this delayed onset clinical trial, the final protocol will be developed in coordination with the other
Clinical Sites and the DCC. We clearly express our intent to participate in a cooperative manner with the
other Clinical Centers, the DCC, the NIH, and the DSMC in all aspects of research in a manner consistent
with the terms of the award. The Specific Aims are:
 Specific Aim 1: To develop a protocol in coordination with the other Clinical Sites and the DCC,
to compare morphine, methadone, and buprenorphine, while taking into account non-pharmacologic
factors and adjunct therapies for the management of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.
 Specific Aim 2: To recruit and enroll infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome at our
clinical site in the randomized controlled trial, and measure important short-term outcomes by hospital
discharge.
 Specific Aim 3: (A) To determine important neurodevelopmental and other clinical, social, and
environmental outcomes in enrolled infants at two-year follow-up outcomes; and (B) In collaboration
with the other Clinical Sites and the DCC, to disseminate findings of the clinical trial and help develop
evidence-based clinical practice guidelines."

Despite the increased risk of cervical cancer (CC) for women living with HIV (WLWH), access to CC screening
in Nigeria is limited. Access to screening, prevention programs, and highly active antiretroviral therapy has
contributed to dramatic declines in the incidence of many AIDS-associated malignancies but have not lowered
CC risk in WLWH. Therefore, we seek to leverage the existing HIV treatment infrastructure in Nigeria to
integrate home-based CC (HCC) screening for WLWH and evaluate the implementation and sustainability of
this model. We will weave HCC activities into the successful, long-standing MoMent (MOther MENTor) peer-
based HIV support program and evaluate the implementation of this adapted program for adoption, integration,
sustainability, and potential for national scale-up. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) conceptual
frameworks will guide our implementation and impact evaluation. In this project, we will pursue three specific
aims: 1) use a stakeholder deliberation conference methodology to adapt the successful MoMent program to
promote home-based HPV CC screening and follow-up treatment for women who are HIV positive; 2)
implement the MoMent HIV+HCC screening program and assess program reach, effectiveness, adoption, and
fidelity; and 3) conduct post-implementation process evaluation of barriers and enablers to program
maintenance and sustainability. Stakeholder input from WLWH, peer counselors, clinical managers, and
federal/state policymakers will shape the adapted program and promote its successful implementation in a
sample of 1,500 WLWH. We will be among the first to apply recent systematic review findings that the
“characteristics of systems” construct of CFIR is particularly relevant in low/middle income countries. We
ensure scalability by focusing on national and state policymaker perspectives in the pre-implementation,
implementation, and maintenance phases of the adapted program. In this project, we will advance CC control
for WLWH in Nigeria and generate data that can inform effective adaptation and implementation of evidence-
based cancer control strategies for people living with HIV in low/middle income countries worldwide."

The goal of the NIMG R25 IPERT program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance
the training of a workforce to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs. This
funding opportunity encourages activities and outreach programs with a primary focus on courses for skills
development, structured mentoring activities, and outreach programs to create a highly skilled and diverse
workforce. A major challenge facing the toxicology profession is a lack of a diversified workforce. Although the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has recognized this problem for many years and
indeed has tried to address it through different funding mechanisms, the number of underrepresented
individuals in the toxicology profession remains disappointingly low. Therefore, a new approach is needed to
close the gap. One of the shortcomings of recruiting undergraduates into the toxicology graduate research
programs is a lack of undergraduate toxicology training programs in the country. Toxicology is taught starting
at graduate level. Because of the lack of awareness and knowledge about toxicology and its role in the
protection of human, animal, and environmental health, undergraduates with interest in pursuing graduate
education naturally will not consider it as an option. UC Davis in Davis, CA, in partnership with The Society of
Toxicology (SOT), are collaborating with Iowa State University (ISU) in Ames, IA , Tuskegee University (TU),
Tuskegee, AL, and The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus OH, to deliver a one-year long undergraduate
toxicology mentoring and skills development training (ToxMSDT) program. ToxMSDT has two specific aims.
Specific Aim #1: Delivery of a mentoring program to underrepresented undergraduate students enrolled in
science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Specific Aim #2: Delivery of an online training program
consisting of case studies and short e-modules for skills development. This innovative flexible online program
is accessible on mobile devices as well as from computers connected to the internet and is open to the general
public 24/7. In this regard, this is a unique toxicology outreach program. We propose increase enrollment to 20
undergraduate students each year and to expand recruitment nationally, inclusive of all underrepresented
segments of the US population. Expected outcomes of this unique training program include: a) at least 65%
of program alumni engaging in subsequent research programs, internships or other relevant activities in
toxicology or a related area in the biomedical sciences professions; b) at least 50% of program alumni applying
to toxicology, or related biomedical sciences graduate programs or joining the toxicology workforce; c) a
sustained network of toxicology students, researchers and professionals committed to expanding toxicology
mentoring and career opportunities for underrepresented segments of the US population."

10916259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intracellular pH (pHi) dynamics are a critical regulator of cell fate changes. Our lab and others demonstrated
that an increase in pHi is necessary for the differentiation and lineage specification of multiple cell types,
including mouse embryonic stem cells, Drosophila ovarian follicle stem cells, mouse intestinal stem cells, and
chick paraxial mesoderm. Our lab has also shown how pHi dynamics regulate cell adhesion and migration
behaviors by modifying the protonation state of pH-sensing proteins, including -catenin, cofilin, talin, and focal
adhesion kinase. However, the mechanisms underlying pHi regulation of cell fate changes remain unresolved.
Furthermore, our understanding of pHi dynamics during embryonic development in vivo is limited, largely due
to lack of appropriate models. To address this, I generated a novel system for interrogating the functional
significance of pHi dynamics during embryonic development in vivo using zebrafish, a genetically tractable
organism suited for in vivo live cell imaging of embryos. Using this new model, I will determine the role of pHi
dynamics in the development of cranial neural crest (NC), a highly conserved vertebrate embryonic cell
population that gives rise to diverse cell types, including chondrocytes, osteocytes, and odontoblasts. Many
cell behaviors involved in cranial NC development are regulated by pHi dynamics in other cell types, including
lineage specification, cell migration, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Thus, cranial NC represents an
ideal model for addressing the gaps in our understanding of pHi dynamics during embryonic development in
vivo. By following early NC cells through the differentiation of cranial lineages, I will test the central
hypothesis that pHi dynamics regulate cranial NC development, at the stage of delamination,
migration, or lineage specification. In Aim 1, I will resolve spatial and temporal pHi dynamics during
zebrafish cranial NC development by in vivo live cell imaging. My preliminary data indicate a higher pHi in
migratory compared with premigratory cranial NC cells. In Aim 2, I will experimentally perturb pHi in zebrafish
NC cells through pharmacologic and genetic modulation of plasma membrane ion transporters and determine
the effect on cranial NC cell behaviors and transcription, thus establishing the functional significance of pHi
dynamics during zebrafish cranial NC development. My findings have promise to reveal new insight on the
cellular and molecular factors controlling craniofacial development, with important implications for human
congenital diseases and tissue repair."

The overarching objectives and specific aims of this IPERT program are to (1) prepare trainees for
successful multi-disciplinary Biophotonics careers and support biomedical workforce development. This will
be achieved by (2) advancing the technical and operational proficiency of our trainees in Multiscale

(3) providing our trainees with sustained mentorship for professional development. This will be accomplished
by establishing foundational technical and operational skills in the area of Multiscale Biophotonics during a
12-day onsite short course at the University of California, Irvine. This 12-day short course utilizes an
integrated modular design and evidence based learning consisting of (a) lectures, (b) technology
demonstrations, (c) laboratories combining hands-on data acquisition with computational analysis using our
custom Virtual Tissue Simulator (VTS) software platform, (d) Team Science training, (e) mentored capstone
problem-based learning (PBL) proposal development, (f) guest lectures on the use of an interdisciplinary
Biophotonics approach to address biomedical problems, (g) panel discussions on academic and industrial
career paths, and (h) tours of academic and industrial facilities. Further application and growth in trainee skill
development will be accomplished by a mentored capstone problem-based learning project to be pursued for
one year following the short course completion. In parallel with the short course and year-long PBL project,
we will offer both technical and professional mentorship. Our technical mentorship aims to support
Biophotonics, instrument and measurement design, technology development, as well as modeling,
computation and usage of open-source Computational Biophotonics Tools. Our professional mentorship
program aims to aid trainees in identifying appropriate short- and long-term professional goals and develop
strategies to attain them. The course has been designed for interdisciplinary group of graduate student, post-
doctoral researcher, and faculty scientists and engineers. We propose an aggressive outreach plan to support
the participation of trainees who are traditionally underrepresented within STEM as well as from geographic
regions that have historically received low levels of NIH support. We aim to train up to 20 individuals each
year.
 In summary, our program provides a technical foundation and mentoring support for trainees to advance
and apply an integrated technical proficiency in Multiscale Biophotonics to solve biomedical challenges. As
the integration of expertise spanning modeling, computation and experiment are in demand in biomedical
research and technology development, the proposed program advances NIGMS programmatic goals for
training a diverse biomedical research workforce with expertise most relevant to the NIGMS Division of
Biophysics, Biomedical Technology, and Computational Biosciences."

Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) is the main clinical campus of Thomas Jefferson
University (TJU) and will serve as clinical site for the “HEAL Initiative: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal
Syndrome Pharmacological Treatments Comparative Effectiveness Trial - Clinical Sites” RFA-
HD-21=031. The site will be led by the co-PI structure of Walter Kraft, MD (TJU) and Susan
Adeniyi-Jones, MD (TJU and Nemours at Jefferson). TJU has a 40-year history of leadership in
optimizing approaches to the care opioid use disorder in pregnancy at the Maternal Addiction
Treatment, Education, and Research (MATER) program, which carries a maternal census of >200
women. The current investigative team has been leaders in conducting clinical trials examining
the optimal pharmacological treatments for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). This
work has included neonatal first use and pharmacometric driven dose optimization of
buprenorphine. TJU was the national top enroller in the recently completed AIM2NAS study
examining ondansetron as pharmacologic adjunct to reduce NOWS symptoms. These clinical
trials, along with work in genetic sample collection, have enrolled over 450 infants in NOWS
related research. TJUH engages in maximal non-pharmacologic care and has a well-established
quality assessment and improvement program around NOWS care. There is a robust continuum
of care that supports women with opioid use disorders before, during, and after delivery. This
supportive culture has resulted in high rate of agreeing to participate in clinical trials (~70% of
mothers approached) allows for longitudinal follow up of infants. Neurodevelopmental
assessment is available for infants across the tri-state region catchment area of Philadelphia. The
investigative team is experienced in the conduct and design of multi-center clinical trials and of
data safety monitoring board functioning. The investigators have has been involved in national
and international consortia dedicated to optimizing care in NOWS."

The objective of this conference grant request is to provide support for certain aspects of
the annual meeting of the International Society of Neurogastronomy (ISN) for the next five
years. ISN is still a relatively new society whose composition of scientists, clinicians,
nutritionists, agricultural experts, food service professionals, and chefs naturally
predisposes it to focus on translational issues fundamental to how the chemical senses
impact human health. The first two specific objectives are to provide a venue and
opportunity that brings these groups together and facilitates the synergies that arise when
distinctly different fields interact productively. The third specific objective is to attract,
stimulate, and promote the careers of the young scientists that are the future of the field of
neurogastronomy. The fourth specific objective is to do outreach that serves health and
culinary professionals by informing them about the impact that smell and taste has upon
diet, nutrition, and the growing health problems of obesity-related diseases. The fifth
specific objective is to ensure that this new field embraces a culture of diversity, weaving
this principle into its early development by recruiting persons of diverse backgrounds to the
conference."

behavioral medicine by creating and disseminating knowledge, cultivating discourse, and inspiring change that
culminates in better health for all. ABMR members are distinguished mid-level and senior scientists, including
MDs and PhDs, elected by their peers for contributions to behavioral medicine research. Our mission primarily
is accomplished through the annual scientific meeting that brings together our diverse membership and invited
thought leaders to share the latest scientific advances, exchange cutting-edge ideas, and provide stimulating
and engaging discussions in an informal but rigorously scientific atmosphere. ABMR scientists lead
extensive NIH-supported programs of research that integrate biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences to
improve the health and well-being across the lifespan. Our members focus on understanding biologic
mechanisms of aging that underlie leading causes of death and disability (heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's,
diabetes) and developing and implementing effective interventions to maintain health and reduce the burden of
age-related chronic conditions. In 2021, we added an early-stage investigators (ESI) program to the ABMR
annual meeting, specifically to foster career development and leadership skills of promising behavioral
medicine scholars with their first K- or R-level award from NIH. This R13 conference grant will support the
planned 2024 and 2025 annual scientific meetings, including participation of 6 invited Keynote Speakers (3 per
year) and our ESI Program (10 per year). The 2024 meeting will be held June 20-23, 2024, at The Depot in
Minneapolis, MN and the 2025 meeting will be held June 25-28, 2025 in Portland, ME. Our R13 has 3 Aims. In
Aim 1, we seek to promote interdisciplinary discourse on the latest advances in behavioral medicine, public
health and health policy to promote healthy aging and reduce chronic disease disparities. Within this overall
theme, the 2024 meeting will focus on strengthening the impact of our science by enhancing collaborations
among scientists, discussing cutting-edge and integrative team science approaches to research. The 2025

This grant application proposes to use the unique stationary Multi-X-ray-source Array (MXA) technology
developed and applied to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) under our current R01 to: 1) significantly improve
DBT image quality by extending the MXA technology to produce a clinically practical two-dimensional (2D) MXA
and 2) demonstrate a capable and fully characterized 2D MXA DBT system to use for clinical trials under a
follow-on R01 Academic–Industrial Partnership program.
By the time the first film-based commercial tomosynthesis systems were developed in the 1970s, it was
realized that 2D motion of the X-ray source significantly improved image quality relative to 1D motion due to
better blurring of the shadows of structures both above and below the plane of interest. All existing commercial
DBT systems use 1D motion because 2D mechanical motion is complicated and expensive and would significantly
increase scan times which are already too long at 4 to 25 s with the 1D motion-based systems. Compare this to
mammography, where it is preferred to keep scan times under 2 s to minimize patient-motion artifacts.
Extending MXA technology to make 2D breast tomosynthesis practical – by meeting scan time constraints –
will provide superior performance compared with all commercial breast tomosynthesis systems on the market
today, while at the same time decreasing system size and cost. The net result would be a significant increase
in the capability of DBT systems and a broadening of their availability to bring better care to more people
sooner.
The Specific Aims of this application are:
Aim 1. Use modeling and experiments to design the 2D MXA-DBT prototype system
Aim 2. Build 2D MXA DBT prototype system
Aim 3. Evaluate performance of 2D MXA DBT prototype system"
10908300,"M cells have been shown to sample luminal antigens and use transcytosis to deliver these antigens to underlying
antigen presenting dendritic cells. Thus, they serve as key regulators of mucosal immunity. Despite the vast body of
literature on the immunologic role of M cells in other mucosal organs, airway M cells have only recently been described
and almost no functional or molecular characterization has been performed. We present the first single cell transcriptomes
of murine airway M cells and identify airway M cell signaling cascades that regulate inflammation. We have discovered
that airway M cells occur as solitary cells in the murine trachea and as patches in the murine small airway, and we report
the directed differentiation of human airway M cells from primary human airway epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that
airway M cells are induced by the administration of the signaling factor RANKL, treatment with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
and influenza infection. Interestingly, M cells can occur as solitary cells, but in the setting of physiologic stimuli like LPS
or influenza infection, patches of M cells are associated with lymphoid follicles suggesting a functional epithelial-immune
unit.
 In this grant application, we propose to use our combined expertise in stem cell biology, epithelial biology, lung
inflammation, and influenza infection to define the functional biology of lung M cells. We will start by defining the cellular
origins of murine and human airway M cells. We have now generated a comprehensive battery of murine genetic driver
lines for lineage tracing all the cells of airway epithelium. Herein, we propose to deploy this set of murine lines, for the first
time, in order to precisely define all the putative parental epithelial cell types that can give rise to M cells. We will also
clarify the role of RANKL-RANK signaling pathways in murine models of inflammation. Finally, to define airway M cell
functions, we constructed a new Sox8-CreER driver mouse that allows us to specifically label, genetically modify, and
ablate M cells. We will integrate these genetic reagents with existing murine disease models to elucidate the role of
functional roles of M cells in models of airway inflammation and influenza infection. Lastly, we will dissect the molecular
mechanisms of two candidate chemokines that govern M cell-immune cell interactions using genetic and pharmacological
manipulation in combination with a novel tracheal explant and lung slice live imaging platform."

 The immune system becomes functionally impaired with aging (inflammaging), impacting risk and
outcome of infection, vaccination, cancer, cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity. Individuals with Down
syndrome (DS) exhibit clinical, cellular and biochemical features of inflammaging, including increased
autoimmunity, decreased naïve T cells and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. We developed a novel
unbiased approach to analyze immune architecture in people with DS and quantitatively showed that people
with DS exhibit advanced immune aging beginning in childhood driven in part by dysregulation of naïve CD4+ T
cells. This approach showed shared features of advanced immune aging in DS and other autoimmune
disease, suggesting functional relevance and overlap. Therefore, understanding (i) how advanced immune
aging explains impaired functional immune responses in DS, and (ii) how dysregulation of naïve CD4+ T cells
contributes to advanced immune aging, will help us develop novel therapeutic strategies to address immune
defects in DS. Moreover, this understanding will help us identify subsets of the general population who may
benefit from similar therapeutic strategies. This also establishes a basis to understand which genes on
chromosome 21 drive advanced immune aging, with attendant mechanistic and translational implications. We
hypothesize that advanced immune aging impairs immune responses by dysregulating naïve CD4+ T
cells via cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pathways. We propose key experiments here to advance our
understanding of immune aging and immune response in DS. Our specific aims are:
1: Dissecting mechanistic features of naïve CD4+ T cell dysregulation in DS-inflammaging. We will
leverage a novel DS biorepository that I helped establish at BRI to examine how DS impacts CD4+ T cell
biology in the absence of confounding immune disorders. We will use in vitro assays coupled with RNAseq to
identify and test candidate mechanisms. We will study individuals with mosaic DS to provide unique insight to
dissect the cell-intrinsic roles of trisomy 21 in CD4+ T cell dysregulation in vivo.
2: Interrogate phenotypic and functional features of DS-inflammaging in vivo. We will use our immune
cellular clock to quantitatively understand how inflammaging impacts vaccine response in people with DS and
controls. We will also examine robustness of our DS-inflammaging findings in an independent cohort and
follow our original cohort longitudinally to evaluate temporal progression of DS-inflammaging."

 The primary objective of this R01 application is to evaluate the potential additive effect of animal-assisted
intervention (AAI) on a manualized behavioral treatment targeting emotion dysregulation (ED) in children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ED in youth with ASD has been linked to significantly higher rates of psychiatric
hospitalizations, suicidal ideation, use of psychotropic medications, school disciplinary actions, peer rejection,
failed college and employment transitions, and poorer quality of life. Our group developed Regulating Together
(RT), an intensive group-based treatment with a concurrent parent group that employs evidence-based
intervention techniques of cognitive behavioral therapy, parent training, and mindfulness and acceptance-based
therapy. Preliminary evidence for its feasibility and efficacy has been demonstrated, including reductions in
emotional reactivity and dysphoria and increases in heart rate variability and cognitive flexibility at 10-weeks
following intervention. Despite this, change did not occur immediately post intervention. Animal Assisted
Interventions (AAI) have emerged as a promising approach for youth with ASD, demonstrating improvements in
irritability, hyperactivity, positive affect, and quality of life. AAI also has shown to increase in-session engagement
and learning. Yet, AAI has not yet been utilized to systematically target ED in ASD nor has it been examined in
conjunction with a manualized intervention.
 In the current study, we propose a multi-site randomized clinical trial of RT with and without a canine
present to evaluate its immediate and longer-term efficacy. In 240 youth (ages 8-12 years) with ASD, we will
assess RT with AAI (RT-Canine) and without AAI (RT-Standard) on primary ED symptom of reactivity, and
secondary outcomes, including dysphoria, caregiver stress, cognitive flexibility, mindfulness awareness, and
emotion regulation skills knowledge. We hypothesize that the canines will increase therapeutic engagement
measured through alliance, motivation, and improved behavior, which will then increase intervention session
level learning, and ultimately immediate and long-term intervention outcomes. Furthermore, based on our
preliminary evidence, we also will explore an objective outcomes measure of heart rate/heart rate variability and
its relationship to engagement, learning, and ED symptom outcomes.
 This proposal is relevant to the NICHD Human-Animal Interaction funding opportunity by addressing the
critical public health issue of ASD through examination of AAI efficacy by utilizing standardized data collection
outcome methods. In addition, we closely address protection for both the canines and the youth with ASD
throughout the proposal. Finally, we will make a concerted effort to include youth from minority groups, as
emphasized in the FOA. Ultimately, findings from our study have the potential to expand both ASD and AAI
research, with immense impact on the well-being and outcomes of youth with ASD as evidence-based
interventions for ED in this population is a critical gap in mental health care."

Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, affect 10-20% of pregnant
women and are major risk factors for future maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD). Though moderate-to-
vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) during pregnancy can reduce these risks, less than 25% of pregnant
women meet MVPA guidelines. Identification of additional modifiable behaviors that could reduce maternal
health risks during pregnancy is needed to inform clinical interventions and practice. Remarkably, little is known
about the role of sedentary behavior or sleep in adverse pregnancy outcomes that increase future CVD risk. This
is a critical research gap because sedentary behavior and sleep are increasingly recognized as CVD risk factors
in the general population, independent of MVPA. Unfortunately, existing studies in pregnancy largely focus on
MVPA rather than the emerging paradigm that considers the full 24-hour behavioral cycle (i.e., sedentary
behavior, sleep, light-intensity physical activity, and MVPA), lack repeated measures, use suboptimal
assessment methods, and fail to measure clinically relevant outcomes. Clarifying how sedentary behavior and
sleep influence pregnancy outcomes could inform intervention targets and guidelines to improve cardiovascular
health during and after pregnancy. The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine the associations of
sedentary behavior (Aim 1) and sleep (Aim 2) with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse
pregnancy outcomes that increase future CVD risk. Novel statistical methods will be used to determine optimal
24-hour behavioral patterns (Aim 3) during pregnancy for cardiovascular health. For this, 500 women in early
pregnancy will be recruited to take part in a multi-site (Universities of Iowa and Pittsburgh) cohort study. Women
will wear three state-of-the-art devices for seven days in each trimester of pregnancy to assess sedentary
behavior (activPAL micro 3), sleep (ActiWatch Spectrum Plus), and physical activity (ActiGraph GT3X).
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse outcomes will be obtained through medical chart
abstraction. We hypothesize that women with a high sedentary behavior pattern, short sleep duration pattern,
and poor sleep quality pattern across trimesters will be more likely to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
(primary), gestational diabetes, preterm birth, small-for-gestational age infants, high blood pressure, and poor
glycemic control (secondary). Further, we hypothesize that statistically reallocating time spent in sedentary
behavior for physical activity (LPA or MVPA), but not sleep (among adequate or high duration sleepers), will be
associated with lower incidence of these adverse outcomes. In direct response to the NHLBI Research Priority
3.CC.04, this project will use advanced methods and models to assess and characterize the 24-hour behavioral
cycle during pregnancy to better understand differences in health. This project will inform guidelines on optimal
24-hour behavioral patterns in pregnancy, as well as lay the foundation for future studies testing behavioral
interventions in pregnancy to achieve optimal outcomes and improve women’s long-term cardiovascular health."

The genetic causes of human diseases are rapidly being identified thanks to a revolution in human
genomics. Progress toward a deeper understanding, however, requires further analysis of the
underlying developmental, cellular and molecular mechanisms, as well as the establishment of
predictive disease models to test therapeutic options. Ultimately, genes do not function in
isolation; they are grouped spatially and temporally at multiple nested levels, the most salient
functional unit being the single cell. Observing biological systems at the cellular level provides an
unprecedented opportunity to define functional modularity and combinatorial interactions of
genes in various physiological contexts. Many of these contexts are conserved in evolution,
deviations from which produce important innovations but which also lead to malformations and
disease. Accordingly, a Human Cell Atlas is being built with the hope that it will form a core of this
single-cell perspective. Parallel work in model organisms will be crucial, and cell atlases are being
constructed currently e.g. in mouse and zebrafish. From Gurdon's discovery of nuclear
reprogramming, through characterization of the cyclins that drive the cell cycle, to many recent
discoveries on signaling among cells, Xenopus remains at the forefront of biomedical research, as
a unique model. We propose to establish a Single Cell Atlas for this important model system which
would enhance the value of the unique methods already available in Xenopus and allow effective
communication to other experimental systems including human. It will be a critical complement
to other emerging Xenopus tools, such as CRISPR-edited mutant lines, which could be most easily
characterized in developmental and adult function at the single-cell level. Moreover, the large cell
size of amphibian embryonic cells has already made single-cell proteomics possible in Xenopus,
well ahead of other organisms; thus, Xenopus is the natural choice for spearheading the shift
towards single-cell proteomics. Overall, this project will enhance a critical animal model for the
investigation of human disease mechanisms and open new horizons for many already supported
NIH projects in other Institutes that focus on specific organ systems and disease."
10908553,"Project Summary
Cervical cancer screening represents a remarkable success story that has led to profound reductions in cancer
incidence and mortality in the United States (US), yet fundamental questions about screening cessation
remain. For the last 25 years, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening
cessation at age 65 in those deemed to have been adequately screened. The increase in life expectancy over the
last 25 years, however, raises questions about whether healthy, well-screened women over age 65 should
continue screening. In fact, an estimated 21% of cervical cancer cases and 35% of deaths in the US occur after
age 65. Screening older people for cancer, however, involves a judicious consideration of the balance between
benefits and harms. For example, cervical cancer prevention through screening is only achieved by performing
surgical procedures on the cervix, including hysterectomies, which may pose a higher risk of major medical
complications for older women. Because up to 60% of women have not met the criteria to end screening at age
65, an estimated 1,700,000 women turning age 65 each year in the US can be expected to continue screening.
In its most recent guideline, the USPSTF stated that research is needed to elucidate the balance of benefits and
harms in various groups of women over age 65. The aims of this proposal will fill significant evidence gaps
concerning the benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening after age 65. Aim 1 will involve a cohort study
of about 280,000 women over 65 who were long-term members of two large health systems during 2005-2022
to investigate cervical cancer incidence, stage at cancer diagnosis, and cancer mortality by screening history
documented ages 55 to 65. We will also use causal inference methods to emulate a randomized trial using
observational data to estimate the effectiveness of screening after age 65 on cancer outcomes. Aim 2 involves a
cohort study of women screened after age 65 to investigate harms, including the incidence and predictors of
medical complications resulting from diagnostic procedures and surgical interventions. We will also conduct
qualitative interviews in a sample of women to evaluate the personal experiences of women who continue with
the screening process after age 65. Aim 3 will involve the enumeration of actual screening outcomes of 33,000
women screened after age 65 to inform a decision analytic model that will estimate benefits and harms of
screening continuation after age 65 compared with screening cessation. We have assembled an ideal study
team with expertise in obstetrics/gynecology, infectious disease, cancer epidemiology, cancer screening
decision modeling, biostatistics, and geriatrics. Completion of this proposal’s aims will fill important gaps and
move the field forward by providing evidence to make cervical cancer screening guidelines that better balance
benefits and harms in older women."
10922775,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The natural history of high-risk, localized prostate cancer, accounting for a substantial proportion of the 29,000
prostate cancer–related deaths per year in the U.S., is highly variable: there are patients who are cured with
surgery or radiation, while others develop metastases and succumb to their disease. To date, attempts to
stratify patients within these subsets of high-risk, localized prostate cancer have proven inadequate. There is
particular urgency within the African American population, where risk of lethal disease is highest. There is a
tremendous need for biomarkers that can reliably distinguish the most aggressive forms of disease within high-
risk groups. Specifically, we focus on the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway, where certain variants appear to
be associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness. In this proposal, we will address two important questions
in the field: 1) Among patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer, can we identify genetic aberrations in
DDR pathway associated with the most aggressive forms of the disease? 2) Do DDR variants contribute to
increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer among African American men?
In the first aim, we focus on inherited germline variants in the DDR pathway. Using large retrospective and
prospective cohorts of patients with high-risk, localized prostate cancer, we will perform sequencing in DNA
derived from blood samples and examine associations with development of lethal prostate cancer over long-
term follow-up. In our second aim, we will interrogate the somatic genome and matched germline using DNA
derived from radical prostatectomy specimens and corresponding blood samples, and we will study
associations with lethal disease. In the third aim, we will determine the prevalence of germline DDR in a larger
cohort of African American prostate cancer patients and estimate the extent to which DDR mutations contribute
to prostate cancer disparities.
Completion of the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide an unparalleled look at the association
between DDR and lethal forms of prostate cancer. We have the potential to i) discover specific germline and
somatic biomarkers for lethal disease that could be used to determine treatment strategies at the time of
diagnosis, perhaps using strategies such as PARP inhibition or platinum chemotherapy that target the DDR
pathway; ii) discover germline biomarkers that could be developed as screening tools for the most aggressive
forms of prostate cancer; and iii) define the extent to which mutations in in DDR pathway genes may explain
racial disparities in prostate cancer. The genetic loci and target genes comprising this dataset together with the
other projects will stimulate new targets for therapeutic intervention."
10922777,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The frequency of germline (~12%) and somatic (~25%) alterations in BRCA2, ATM, and other DNA damage
repair (DDR) genes in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has been described. DDR-
altered PC has higher metastatic progression rates, and an attenuated response to androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT). The frequency of DDR alterations in poor-risk non-castrate PC is approximately 10-15%
(predominantly germline). We propose that exceptional responses or cure may be obtained with therapy
targeted at further inhibition of the DDR pathway (PARP inhibition) together with ADT, radical prostatectomy
(RP) and extended lymph node dissection (LND), and radiation to visible metastases.
Our teams’ experience has demonstrated that aggressive, multimodality therapy in non-castrate, high-risk
localized and oligometastatic PC can result in pathologic complete responses in the prostate, along with
durable PSA remissions (undetectable PSA with non-castrate testosterone). Encouraged by this and the
activity seen with olaparib in DDR-altered CRPC, Aim 1 of this project proposes a novel, flexible, randomized,
multi-arm clinical trial platform (MetaCURE trial) to test the ability of targeted systemic therapy with a PARP
inhibitor, together with ADT+abiraterone, RP and LND, and radiation to visible metastases, to eliminate PC in
patients with and without DDR pathway alterations (as classified by alterations in single genes in the pathway).
The protocol is supported by Janssen Pharmaceuticals and the trial opened Q2 2018. The novel structure
allows new treatment arms to be added without writing a new protocol.
Aims 2 and 3 are enabled by the MetaCURE platform’s prospectively embedded correlative science program in
which tumor tissue samples (from diagnostic prostate biopsy, RP, lymph nodes, and metastatic sites) and
blood samples for cell-free DNA analysis will be systematically collected before and after therapy. All patients
will have paired tumor/germline sequencing using MSK-IMPACT to confirm the result of local tumor profiling
and to assess for loss of heterozygosity of DDR pathway mutations. In-depth analyses with whole exome
sequencing and RNA-Seq will be carried out on exceptional responders/nonresponders to identify potential
biomarkers of response/resistance and in non-DDR altered tumors that respond, new genotypes that reflect
DDR-altered status. Analysis of cell-free DNA in Aim 3 will complement Aim 2, by tracking levels of DDR
alterations to assess for minimal residual disease and to identify potential mechanisms of drug resistance. The
evaluation of actionable mutations associated with resistance to PARP inhibition and ADT, the evaluation of
treatment effect on genomic mutation burden, and observations from other projects in this grant (Project 1 and
Project 3) will inform the development of subsequent treatment cohorts in the MetaCURE trial."

three aims. First, to aid in the identification of germline mutations associated with increased heritable risk or
poor long-term clinical outcomes, the Genomics Core will conduct targeted sequencing of 250 DNA damage
repair (DDR) pathway genes or WES of prostate cancer tumors and matched germline DNA (Project 1) from
men with prostate cancer for whom we have long-term clinical outcomes data. To further facilitate the
identification of novel germline mutations that associate with increased heritable risk or poor clinical outcomes,
all sequencing data generated as part of this P01 will be integrated in real-time with published datasets and
unpublished genomic data from ongoing profiling initiatives at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK-
IMPACT) and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI-Profile). Second, the core will explore mechanisms of
treatment resistance by analyzing tumors and cfDNA collected before and after PARP inhibitor treatment from
patients enrolled on the MetaCURE clinical trial platform (Project 2). This latter aim required the Genomics
Core to develop a cfDNA assay (MSK-ACCESS) that could be used to monitor patients for minimal residual
disease and could also identify mutations that mediate response and resistance to PARP inhibition. Third, the
core will facilitate data sharing both within the P01 and with the broader research community, including the
NCI. All three research projects are highly integrated with and rely extensively on the Genomics Core to
achieve their proposed aims. More specifically, the core will assist Project 1 by sequencing (targeted and
whole exome) germline and, in some cases, matched tumor DNA from several large cohorts of annotated
patient samples to identify alterations in DDR pathway genes. The core will also provide real-time access to
the germline data generated by MSK-IMPACT and DFCI-Profile. The core will assist Project 2 by screening
patients for DDR aberrations and with the analysis of tumor samples and cfDNA collected before and after
PARP inhibitor treatment to monitor treatment response and to explore mechanisms of drug resistance. The
core will work with Project 3 to perform molecular analyses of cells engineered to harbor deleterious BRCA2
or ATM alleles or in which ATM or CDH1 have been deleted. Finally, the Genomics Core will help all three
projects make predictions about the pathogenicity of individual mutations to facilitate data interpretation, study
enrollment, and prioritization of mutants for functional characterization."

The Administrative Core (AC) will provide all of the administrative and communications support to the Tri-State
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma TBEL (Tri-PACT) Center investigators, and form the central “hub” for productive
interactions within the NCI TBEL community. The title of our Tri-PACT Center proposal is “Tumor
Microenvironment Crosstalk Drives Early Lesions in Pancreatic Cancer”, and our Center incorporates three
institutions – UT MD Anderson cancer Center (UTMDACC), University of Michigan (UMich) and Johns Hopkins
University (JHU) in a collaborative and integrated U54 endeavor to study early pancreatic neoplasia. The Tri-
PACT Center AC will be led by overall Contact PI, Dr. Anirban Maitra, and Co-PI Dr. Marina Pasca di Magliano,
and housed within the Sheikh Ahmed Center for Pancreatic Cancer Research at UTMDACC. The AC will be
supported by a PhD-level Core Administrator with experience with multi-investigator grants. Further, Dr. Yu
Shen, Professor and Chair ad interim of Biostatistics at UTMDACC, will provide comprehensive statistical
support for the Tri-PACT Center and will be assisted by a senior statistical analyst. Dr. Maitra and the AC have
considerable experience in overseeing and participating in multi-investigator grants that include programmatic
NCI U01, P01 and P50 Grants. The overall goals of the AC will be (a) to monitor research progress and to
provide stable and continuous leadership that advances integration, communication, and collaboration among
the Tri-PACT Center investigators participating in the three proposed projects and shared resource core
(Multiscale Computational Oncology Research Core or M-CORE), and (b) to ensure productive interactions with
other concurrently funded TBEL U54 sites and the TBEL CDMC, through formal and informal collaborative
endeavors under the TBEL umbrella. The AC will leverage the wide-ranging research expertise of both the
Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and the External Advisory Board (EAB) in critical decision-making steps, such as
changes in research directions of currently proposed projects. The AC will ensure fiscal management, including
personnel, budgets, and effort oversight, facilitate organization of virtual and in-person work-in-progress
meetings for Tri-PACT center investigators, engage in manuscript preparation, and provide federally mandated
progress and other reports to the NCI. The AC will facilitate attendance for the PIs and Tri-PACT investigators
to the semi-annual TBEL consortium meetings, and ensure our participation in other network activities, including
TBEL working groups, trans-network collaborations, and dissemination of results within and beyond the TBEL
community. The AC will serve as a liaison with the TBEL CDMC in ensuring the transfer of TriPACT Center-
generated data and materials under appropriate transfer agreements. The AC will also ensure timely
communication and consultation with the NCI Program Directors for both adherence and deviations from stated
programmatic goals. Last but not the least, the AC will also enhance awareness of pancreatic cancer early
lesion research and advocacy in the community through public-facing websites and and publications."
10922843,"PROJECT 1 - ABSTRACT
There are two distinct pathways to invasive neoplasia in the pancreas – the more common non-cystic
(pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia or PanIN) and cystic (mostly, intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm or IPMN). Both PanIN and IPMNs occur at significantly higher rates in the population than invasive
cancer, reiterating that only a fraction of precursor lesions progress to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), but determining which patient will progress is currently not possible. PanINs and IPMNs are both
characterized by the common occurrence of oncogenic KRAS mutations, while the latter also harbors
concomitant “hotspot” GNAS mutations in 2/3rd of cases. How these early epithelial alterations and their crosstalk
with the tumor microenvironment (TME) impacts progression to cancer remains understudied. The formation of
early pancreatic precursors is accompanied by the expansion of a heterogeneous fibroblast population. In
advanced disease, fibroblasts become cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Little is known about precursor
lesion associated fibroblasts (PAFs), including prevalent differences between the two precursor subtypes. Our
preliminary data show that fibroblast reprogramming occurs in early pancreatic lesions, and leads to expression
of IL6, and IL33. While IL6 is secreted and known to regulate the immune microenvironment, IL33 is prevalently
nuclear in fibroblasts. Interestingly, IPMNs also have extremely elevated epithelial nuclear IL33. IL33 contains a
DNA binding domain and is known to regulate transcription. Based on these observations, we propose to study
the mechanisms of fibroblast reprogramming and comparing fibroblast gene expression in PanINs and IPMNs
(Aim 1). Further, we will study the role of fibroblast IL33 in lesion progression and establishment of the precursor
lesion microenvironment (PME) in PanIN and IPMN (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine how epithelial IL33 in
IPMNs regulates the PME as well as progression to malignancy (Aim 3). We will integrate the mouse model and
in vitro studies with primary human tissue and organoids generated in the Wood laboratory (see Project 3).
Together, these studies will shed light on the composition and role of PAFs in different premalignant lesions of
the pancreas."
10922844,"PROJECT 2 – ABSTRACT
The estimated prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) is between 20–30% with intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm (IPMNs) accounting for half of them. Depending on the morphology, location, and genetics
IPMNs can be of high-risk developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and as such significantly
diminishing patient’s survival. While RNF43 is only mutated in a small fraction of PDAC, RNF43 mutations are
prevalent in a high frequency in IPMNs. Although RNF43 has been identified as a negative regulator of Wnt
signaling in colorectal cancers and other preclinical models including PDAC, a phase 1 clinical trial of a Wnt
inhibitor in patients with RNF43 mutated solid cancers (including PDAC) has been proven disappointing. Other
likely organ specific functions of RNF43 might be of great advantage for IPMN progression. Utilizing a conditional
knockout mouse model of RNF43 in context of Kras mutation we found that RNF43 abrogates the mitochondrial
properties and functions while loss of RNF43 improved mitochondrial quality control, increased unfolded protein
response (UPR) and ER stress. These findings let us hypothesize that loss of RNF43 may deregulate the
crosstalk of these organelles in order to maintain proteostasis, metabolic control, and cell survival.
Employing an autochthonous mouse model for functional loss of RNF43 in the context of Kras (generated in the
Dr. Maitra lab), primary genetically engineered cell lines (generated in the Dr. Lyssiotis lab) and human IPMN
derived organoids (generated in the Dr. Wood lab; see Project 3) we propose to pursue the following aims:
First we will investigate whether RNF43 regulates mitochondrial dynamics including biogenesis, fission, fusion
and mitophagy to inhibit IPMN pathogenesis (Aim 1). Further, we will investigate whether RNF43 blocks IPMN
pathogenesis by limiting ER stress through management of ER-mitochondrial dynamics (Aim 2). Lastly, we will
determine whether loss of RNF43 creates a synthetic essentiality for sustained OXPHOS (Aim 1) and
whether/how OXPHOS inhibition impacts the multistep progression in an autochthonous KRC model of
pancreatic cystic neoplasia (Aim 3). Overall, these studies will elucidate the functional role of RNF43 in
mitochondria quality control, ER-mitochondrial dynamics and how this impacts IPMN pathogenesis and
progression."
10922846,"PROJECT 3 - ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer arises from non-invasive precursor lesions that are curable if detected and treated early.
Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) is the most common of these precursor lesions and represents a
critical target of early detection and cancer prevention approaches. Previous studies from our group have
highlighted critical genomic alterations that drive clonal expansion and neoplastic progression in some PanINs.
These studies have also demonstrated that expansion and progression can occur without the accumulation of
additional driver genomic alterations, suggesting that diverse driver mechanisms operate in different PanINs.
The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the transition to HG PanIN can be driven by genomic or precursor
microenvironment (PME) alterations, with distinct drivers dominating in different lesions. To investigate this
hypothesis, the proposed studies will evaluate both cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic drivers of neoplastic
progression in human PanIN samples. We will employ a novel approach that allows both three-dimensional
reconstruction and molecular analysis of human PanIN samples. We will perform multi-region whole exome
sequencing and evolutionary reconstruction in order to correlate genomic alterations with expansion and
progression of neoplastic cells in three dimensions. In order to identify non-genetic drivers of neoplastic
progression, we will analyze immune and stromal cell subsets in the same three-dimensionally reconstructed
PanIN samples using imaging mass cytometry, allowing us to determine the variability of key components of the
PME across multiple regions of these PanIN samples. This complementary analysis will allow us to correlate the
microenvironmental features with the molecular alterations in associated PanIN cells. We will also integrate
predicted neoantigens and T-cell receptor sequencing on the same PanIN regions, providing a multi-dimensional
analysis of the immune response to PanINs. Taken together, these approaches will systematically evaluate
potential drivers of progression in the neoplastic cells and associated immune response, providing crucial
biological insights and a rational foundation for novel early detection and prevention approaches."
10922847,"MULTISCALE COMPUTATIONAL ONCOLOGY RESEARCH CORE (M-CORE) – Abstract
The Multiscale Computational Oncology Research Core (M-CORE) provides computational oncology
expertise from initial experimental design and power studies to ongoing data generation and analysis to data
deposition and sharing for single-cell and genomics data. Core Leader Dr. Fertig is a leader in single-cell multi-
omics for applications to cancer, with a particular focus on translational pancreatic cancer research applications.
The M-CORE will support high-throughput data analysis in all three Tri-State Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma TBEL
(Tri-PACT) Center Projects and Collaborative Projects. Methods will be applied to bridge spatial and temporal
scales to identify cell intrinsic mechanisms underlying pre-malignant lesions progression into invasive cancers.
These will be extended to analyze cell extrinsic, intercellular interactions that mediate malignancy development
and tumor initiation incorporating new three-dimensional imaging technologies from Tri-PACT. Many of these
methods were recently developed by the Core leader, and new algorithms will be developed specifically to meet
the TBEL needs and provide synergy across Projects. Research Projects will be testbeds for new single-cell
methods for dynamic spatial processes and novel imaging technologies, and computational Collaborative
Projects will benefit from M-CORE resources. Standardization in the Core will harmonize data to enable meta-
analyses between biological models and human precursor lesions, biological mechanisms from the Projects,
and novel mechanisms associated with precancer through cross-disease analysis in the broader TBEL
consortium in collaboration with the Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC). The Core Leader will
participate in all regular Center meetings and collaborate closely with the TBEL CDMC to ensure ample
computational resources for new research directions. The Core will partner with the TBEL CDMC to assist with
data standards and harmonization, data validation, data wrangling, and overall data deposition, data and
software sharing, and genomic data sharing. In summary, the M-CORE will support the overall TBEL research
objectives by providing computational methods to characterize the mechanisms of malignancy initiation and
progression into invasive tumors; to analyze spatial and temporal data to infer interactions and crosstalk between
pre-malignant cells with stromal cells, and other cells in the microenvironment; and to perform integrative
analyses to promote Tri-PACT and Consortium synergy by identifying shared mechanisms."
10918019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cytometry experiments are increasingly complex, often involving more than 20 unique parameters. For example,
the recent adaption of spectral flow cytometry means 64 or more channels with 40 simultaneous fluorescent
parameters currently validated in Optimized Multicolor Immunofluorescence Panels (OMIP)-069 have >31 million
combinations of commercially available products for these markers. Successful design of complex multi-param-
eter experiments requires extensive knowledge of panel design principles to organize antigens based on biolog-
ical density and cellular expression patterns. Insufficient user experience and poor panel optimization can lead
to errors in experimental design, resulting in unreliable, internally inconsistent data. These errors can cost thou-
sands of dollars and often waste rare or low-volume samples that may, in some cases, be irreplaceable. Recent
work has estimated that there is nearly $28.2 billion in costs associated with irreproducible preclinical work in
the U.S. alone that is predominantly attributed to poor antibody performance and study design. With the growing
complexity of flow cytometry experiments, there is a need for automated software that accelerates and optimizes
the experimental design process, reduces errors, and lowers the barrier to entry. With NIH Phase I support,
FluoroFinder completed initial development and demonstrated proof-of-concept for IntelliPanel, a highly custom-
izable tool for efficient and optimal design of flow cytometry assays that uses spectral overlap and biological
application information to automatically generate a flow cytometry assay for a given instrument configuration.
FluoroFinder developed the first version of IntelliPanel, conducted a comparison of autogenerated panels com-
pared to published OMIPS, and surveyed expert cytometrists to demonstrate 92% approval of IntelliPanel results
for up to 26 markers. In this Phase II project, FluoroFinder will integrate additional parameters, expand data-
bases, and generate user friendly tools that significantly improve the accuracy of IntelliPanel recommendations
for automated panels with 26 to 40 fluorescent markers and will advance features to improve standardization
and reproducibility in the field through the following Aims: Aim 1: Improve the automated ease-of-use and accu-
racy of recommendations through integration of the antigen density database and the expansion of additional
experimental parameters. Aim 2: Integrate a “Cell Type to Panel” feature to improve experimental reproducibility.
Aim 3: Optimize UX for comprehensive experimental recommendations based on user configuration. IntelliPanel
is expected to yield significant time and cost savings, reduce or eliminate design errors, and lower the barrier to
entry for developing successful flow cytometry experiments. Ultimately, these tools will enable the standardiza-
tion of assays, platforms and analysis that will lead to more consistent and reliable high parameter flow experi-
ments and emerging technologies (e.g., >26 color spectral flow cytometry)."

Most patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) die from right ventricular (RV) failure and all
experience exercise limitation. No RV-specific therapies exist because the mechanisms underlying RV failure
are poorly understood. The discovery of novel, potentially treatable causes of RV failure and exercise limitation
would be an important advance in the treatment of PAH. RV steatosis may be a novel mechanism of RV failure
in human PAH. We and others reported a high prevalence of insulin resistance in patients with PAH. We
recently published that insulin resistance in PAH manifests primarily as abnormalities in lipid metabolism.
Patients with PAH had elevated circulating free fatty acids and long-chain acylcarnitines and we found
impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and RV lipid accumulation (steatosis) in a rodent model of PAH. We
used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify RV lipid in vivo and showed that RV lipid
content is over 10-fold higher in humans with PAH compared with matched controls and may be modifiable
with metformin. In autopsy RV specimens, we found increased ceramide, a mediator of lipotoxicity, and
identified candidate plasma surrogates for RV steatosis. Finally, we present new evidence of skeletal muscle
steatosis in humans to demonstrate that insulin resistance is a systemic feature of PAH. The clinical relevance
of RV steatosis in human PAH is unknown. RV steatosis is common in both heritable and idiopathic PAH and
is not an end-stage phenomenon, which suggests potential for therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that
abnormal lipid metabolism in PAH leads to delivery of fatty acids in excess of RV oxidative capacity, resulting
in steatosis and lipotoxicity. Our objectives are to: 1) Define the relationships between RV steatosis, RV
function, and exercise capacity; 2) Identify mechanistic drivers of RV steatosis including BMPR2 expression
and lipid metabolism; 3) Examine lipid metabolism in PAH skeletal muscle as a potential driver of reduced
functional capacity; and 4) test the response of RV and skeletal muscle steatosis to metformin. In Aim 1
(clinical relevance) we will measure RV and LV lipid in participants with heritable, idiopathic, and scleroderma-
associated PAH. Participants will undergo the 6-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and will be
followed for clinical events. A subgroup will undergo repeat MRS at four timepoints over three years to
determine the natural history of steatosis. We will measure RV lipid in participants before and after metformin
therapy in a separate on-going study. In Aim 2 (mechanism), we will perform metabolomic/lipidomic profiling of
peripheral and coronary sinus plasma and measure BMPR2 expression to identify potential drivers of
steatosis. In Aim 3 (specificity), we will perform MRS on skeletal muscle in Aim 1 participants and matched
healthy controls to clarify the systemic effects of lipid metabolic defects in PAH. We will also test the effect of
metformin on skeletal muscle lipid content and fatigue. The proposed studies address an important knowledge
gap in PAH pathophysiology by interrogating a newly discovered, novel mechanism of RV failure in humans."
10922770,"Project Summary/Abstract
A critical problem facing behavioral weight-loss interventions for adults with obesity is the tendency towards weight regain following weight loss. This is due in part to a failure to address the behavioral lynchpins that underlie obesity for a significant subset: overeating drive (e.g., eating for psychological relief, compulsive eating). This drive can independently lead to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, making it a crucial behavioral target. The objective of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development application is to provide me with high-level training to become an expert in targeting overeating drive, using mindfulness-based and motivational approaches to promote healthy eating. Mindful eating (ME) components may be an important addition to weight loss programs to more directly target overeating drive. Motivational interviewing (MI) is already established as an effective treatment component to help with weight loss and may help reduce overeating drive. No studies have examined MI in combination with ME, herein referred to as ‘Mindful Motivation’ (MM). Congruent with NCCIH’s initiative on advancing the science of symptom management through integrative health interventions, the proposed project aims to 1) identify and optimize specific targets of MM interventions that may reduce overeating drive and 2) pilot test the refined MM intervention in an RCT design with an active control condition (general digital mindfulness). To this end, I will examine pilot study data in which adults with overweight receive 8-weeks of MM. Based on these findings, along with data from focus groups and consultation with a team of experts, I will identify which aspects of the MM intervention most strengthened the target (overeating drive) and optimize these components. I will develop a light touch intervention utilizing both MI and ME components. I will examine which treatment components are most effective (in comparison to the active control) in targeting mechanisms of overeating drive (primarily self- efficacy, impulse control). Preliminary findings will inform an R-level application that evaluates the MM intervention in an adequately powered RCT. This research will help develop mindfulness-based treatments most suitable for adults with overweight and overeating drive, and may promote long-term metabolic health.
Building on my advanced training as a clinical health psychologist with expertise in eating behavior, the K23 mechanism addresses my critical training needs in mechanism-focused intervention development and evaluation. The training plan includes coursework, meetings, readings, and qualitative research to fill these gaps. I have assembled an outstanding team of mentors and advisors at UCSF (Drs. Epel, Mason, Adler, Hartogensis, Le Grange, and Garber) and outside of UCSF (Drs. Wolever, Cassin and West) with expertise in complementary areas. As my long-term career goal is to develop and disseminate integrative interventions to improve the health of individuals with obesity, the K23 mechanism will provide me with opportunities to grow as an independent clinical researcher, and develop better evidence-based strategies."
10922774,"Much of what we know about poxvirus innate immune evasion comes from work with the prototype orthopoxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV). However, it is becoming clear that what we know for VACV is not always true for other poxviruses. The example we have been working on is monkeypox virus (MPXV). VACV has an E3L gene, which is essential for interferon-resistance, both in cells in culture and in the animal model. Despite being highly pathogenic, MPXV is missing 37 residues from the N-terminus of its E3 homologue. Thus, it is surprising that MPXV is as pathogenic as it is, despite missing this essential region of the E3 innate immune evasion protein. We have shown that while the lack of an N-terminal innate immune evasion domain in MPXV allows the virus to be sensed by the host, MPXV has evolved at least two apparently independent mechanisms to overcome the effects of being sensed in cells. The goals of this research are to understand how this unique human pathogen is sensed in infected cells and how it has evolved to counter the effects of sensing. Loss of this innate immune evasion domain makes vaccination against MPXV problematic. The final goal of this project is to develop a vaccine that can safely protect against MPXV infection."
10923335,"PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic diseases are a significant problem in aging population causing immense
economic burden to healthcare systems around the world. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of
dementia, affecting as many as 5.8 million Americans who are aged 65 and older and is the sixth leading cause of
death in the United States. As age is the greatest risk factor in developing AD, there is great interest in the possibility
of targeting AD through interventions that slow or delay aging. Calorie restriction (CR) can slow or prevent AD in
animal models, but reduced calorie diets are notoriously difficult to sustain. In this proposal, I will examine if dietary
regimens and drugs that mimic aspects of a traditional CR diet, but which are easier to adhere to, can slow or
prevent the development and progression of AD.
 Studies from the Lamming lab and others have shown that protein restriction (PR) improves many aspects
of metabolic health in both humans and mice, and extends mouse lifespan, likely in part through reducing the
activity of the amino acid sensitive kinase mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a
key regulator of autophagy. In preliminary studies, I have found that PR reduces brain mTORC1 activity and
activates autophagy, and slows or prevents cognitive decline and the progression of AD pathology in the 3xTg
mouse model of AD. Our lab has shown that restriction of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine,
isoleucine, valine) recapitulates the metabolic benefits of PR and extends lifespan. Defects in BCAA catabolism,
or excess dietary BCAAs, may drive the pathogenesis of AD by increasing BCAA levels in the brain, activating
mTORC1, and inhibiting autophagy. However, the role of individual BCAAs in these effects are unknown.
 I will determine the effects of restricting protein or leucine, the essential amino acid that most strong
agonizes mTORC1, on metabolic health, cognition, AD pathology, and autophagy in the APP/PS1 mouse model
of AD, which develops cognitive deficits later in life than the 3xTg mice. I will also test if reducing levels of BCAAs
via pharmacological stimulation of BCAA catabolism reduces brain levels of BCAAs, inhibiting brain mTORC1
signaling and boost autophagy, recapitulating the beneficial effects of restrictive diets. Finally, utilizing distinct
feeding regimens I will determine if prolonged daily fasting, which CR animals are subjected to in laboratory
experiments, can recapitulate the beneficial effects of a CR diet on the development and progression of AD.
 Together, these proposed aims will address long-standing questions about how dietary interventions can
affect the development and progression of AD. I will be completing this fellowship under the mentorship of my
sponsor, Dr. Dudley Lamming, an expert in aging biology, metabolism, and mTOR signaling, and my co-sponsor,
Dr. Luigi Puglielli, a world-leading expert in Alzheimer’s disease. Completing these aims and the accompanying
individualized training plan will help me develop the skills necessary to become a successful tenure track faculty
member focused on the biology of aging and Alzheimer’s disease."
10923558,"Project Summary
Intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, an important cause of community- and
hospital-acquired pneumonia, are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. As the spread
of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is escalating, discovery of novel innate
immune defense mechanisms may hold the key for future therapeutic approaches to deal with this increasing
threat. Intracellular pathogens deploy virulence factors to disable many immune cell functions. To win this
battle, the host must overcome this subversion, through as yet poorly defined mechanisms. To address this
critical gap in knowledge, we seek to define the parameters of successful innate immune clearance of
Legionella. Legionella replicates within alveolar macrophages by using its type IV secretion system to deliver
bacterial effectors, several of which inhibit host protein synthesis. Several effectors inhibit host protein
synthesis. Despite this block in host translation, Legionella infection paradoxically enhances production of
inflammatory cytokines. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated that Legionella-infected alveolar
macrophages are able to synthesize and release IL-1; moreover, IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling was required
for robust production of TNF and IL-12 by bystander myeloid cells. Intriguingly, our newly published study show
for the first time that IL-1R signaling in alveolar epithelial cells induces production of granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which was required for bystander cytokine production and bacterial
clearance. Intriguingly, while GM-CSF acts as a potent inflammatory cytokine in host defense against a broad
spectrum of pathogens, our findings show for the first time that GM-CSF metabolically reprograms monocytes
to undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby promoting cytokine production. We will test the hypothesis that alveolar
epithelium-derived GM-CSF metabolically reprograms monocytes to amplify epigenetic changes that enhance
TLR-driven cytokine production and control of infection. In this renewal, we propose three Aims to first: define
which cell types produce and respond to GM-CSF, second: understand the role of GM-CSF-mediated
metabolic reprogramming in host defense, and third: define how GM-CSF and TLR signaling collaborate to
promote cytokine production. Together, these studies will define novel innate immune mechanisms employed
by the host to surmount pathogen-encoded virulence activities. The proposed research will therefore provide
vital insight into mechanisms of host defense that are utilized against broad classes of microbial pathogens
and aid development of improved anti-microbial therapeutics and vaccines."
10923584,"ABSTRACT
In patients with tuberculosis (TB), detrimental immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection
dominate over beneficial immunity, resulting in uncontrolled Mtb replication, lung granulomas and progression
to TB disease. Immunosuppressive pathways induced by Mtb promote lung pathology and tissue damage and
prevent protective immune responses. This suboptimal lung microenvironment can also interfere with antibiotic-
mediated killing of Mtb. Therefore, in-depth understanding of immunosuppressive mechanisms during TB is
critical for developing novel immunomodulatory therapies that tip the balance away from pathogenic responses
and towards protective immunity and better bacterial clearance. Thus, host-directed therapies (HDT) that target
immunosuppressive pathways in conjunction with anti-TB antibiotics have the potential to improve TB treatment.
Recent studies show that a population of immature myeloid cells that are recruited to the lung after Mtb infection
contribute to immunosuppression during TB. These cells, termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs),
were first described in cancer as negatively regulating tumor microenvironments and suppressing NK cell and T
cell cytotoxic functions. Interestingly, accumulation of MDSCs correlates with TB disease pathology and these
cells can also harbor Mtb intracellularly. However, in contrast to cancer, the functions of MDSCs in TB are poorly
understood. We hypothesize that MDSCs prevent beneficial innate and adaptive immune responses to Mtb
infection by suppressing T cell, NK cell and macrophage functions. We further hypothesize that depleting MDSCs
in Mtb-infected mice will enhance immune responses to Mtb in the lung and significantly improve TB treatment
efficacy.
We have developed a versatile and effective approach to deplete MDSCs in the lung via novel multivalent
synthetic nanoparticle antibodies (SNAbs) that specifically target and deplete MDSCs through antibody-like
killing mechanisms. In this MPI-R01 application, we combine expertise in TB pathogenesis and immunology
research (Rengarajan, Emory) with expertise in immuno-engineering and nanotherapeutics (Roy, Georgia-Tech)
to investigate the role of MDSCs in TB disease progression and pathology, and regulating immunity to TB, and
to explore MDSCs as targets of HDT for TB. We will investigate the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Evaluate
how depleting MDSCs using SNAbs impacts TB disease progression. Aim 2. Investigate how MDSCs suppress
immune responses to Mtb infection. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that depletion of MDSCs will enhance the
efficacy of anti-TB treatment. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of how MDSCs suppress
immunity to TB and provide insights into MDSCs as targets for adjunctive HDTs."

Computational docking is an essential tool for drug discovery and design, and it has been essential to the
development of many drugs currently in clinical use. Given the growing availability of experimentally
determined structures with atomic resolution, its application has become among the most important
structure-based methods. The key role played by docking is underscored by the number of publications about
it (more than 110k citations in the last 4 years), and its key role in the development of many drugs currently in
clinical use. Despite being used now routinely by many researchers for decades, there are still many open
challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main ones is the increase of accuracy of the scoring
function, which would lower the number of false positives from virtual screenings, and increase the success
rates. The other is the need for more efficient computing performance to be able to virtually screen not only the
very large virtual libraries that have been developed recently (which can now easily contain even billions of
chemicals), but also the new large macromolecular complexes that are being characterized with cryoEM, as
well as homology modeling and de novo modeling. The combination of these limitations hinders the
applicability of docking to these problems. We are proposing to develop better tools to address these
challenges, to improve speed, accuracy, and provide the capability of navigating through large libraries and
macromolecular structures."

Globally, malaria (Plasmodium spp.) is the leading parasitic threat to humans and a major cause of morbidity
and mortality. Despite longstanding recognition that Plasmodium species are transfusion transmissible, the
burden and risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) has not been well characterized and evidence-based
policy to safeguard against TTM has not been determined. The advent of novel, molecular assays for blood
donor screening could transform the existing approaches for TTM. We hypothesize that Blood donor screening
for malaria using highly sensitive molecular assays in Uganda and other endemic countries will prevent a
substantial proportion of transfusion-transmitted infections but will be cost-prohibitive and operationally
unfeasible given associated donor loss. In contrast, molecular screening of blood donors in the US, will be
cost-favorable when applied to those deferred for travel to endemic countries. To test this hypothesis, we will
conduct the Malaria Transfusion Risk (MATRix) study to Aim 1) Evaluate donor prevalence of parasitemia and
lab-based screening approaches to address TTM; Aim 2) Quantify the risk of TTM and identify demographic
factors for TTM in a highly endemic country; and Aim 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of different strategies
to mitigate TTM to inform donor policies. The MATRix study will capitalize on a US Dept. of Defense-funded
clinical trial that is underway in Uganda to evaluate (a) the feasibility of implementation of pathogen reduction
technology (PRT) and (b) its impact on transfusion-transmitted infections following whole blood transfusions.
The trial will soon begin collecting blood samples and demographic information from 3,500 donors and 2,000
transfusion recipients; recipients will be evaluated before- and after (days 2, 7, 28) transfusion. To address the
MATRix study aims, we will use clinical data and archived samples from the PRT trial to (1a) compare
performance characteristics of nested PCR, transcription-mediated amplification, antigen testing, microscopy
and antibody testing, to detect Plasmodium spp. in Ugandan blood donors (n=3500) and (1b) describe the
prevalence of Plasmodium seroreactivity and parasitemia by demographic and donor status. (2) Lab testing
and clinical assessment of donor recipient pairs from the PRT trial control arm will enable quantification of
incidence and clinical severity of TTM in recipients of blood from donors in Aim 1 (n=1000). We describe the
risk of TTM by demographic, level of parasitemia and recipient clinical characteristics. Finally, a Markov-based
decision analytic model will be used to evaluate TTM mitigation strategies drawing on input data from Aims 1
and 2, previous publication and/or local expert opinion to (3a) assess the cost-effectiveness of donor screening
for TTM in Uganda by test modality and extent of implementation, while accounting for donor loss. It will also
(3b) compare the cost-effectiveness of donor testing vs. risk-based deferral in the US. This study would guide
global policy on TTM. It would also provide key insight into relative performance of the individual testing
modalities for malaria, while offering insight into transmission dynamics and infectivity of TTM."
10914799,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
In older adults with mild dementia, disruption in the ability to complete instrumental activities of daily living
stems not only from memory deficits, but also from executive dysfunction which also impacts gait and balance.
There is thus an urgent need to develop safe, multi-component interventions designed to maximize functional
capacity in this vulnerable population by simultaneously targeting memory, executive function, and the complex
control of gait and balance. It is now well-established that memory and executive-motor deficits arise from
altered function within specific and spatially distinct brain networks, and, that different forms of transcranial
current stimulation can target these networks to provide symptomatic relief to this population. Parallel lines of
preliminary evidence specifically suggest that 1) transcranial alternating current stimulation targeting the left
angular gyrus (tACS) at gamma frequency can improve episodic and autobiographical memory; and 2)
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can improve
executive function and gait performance, especially when older adults are walking while performing additional
cognitive tasks (i.e., dual tasking). At the same time, important technological advances have recently enabled
researchers to: study and optimize multi-channel stimulation montages (i.e., electrode placement and current
parameters) based upon individualized modeling of generated cortical electric fields; target more than one
brain network at the same time within the same montage; implement active-sham protocols that facilitate
double-blinding and control of the potential effects of peripheral stimulation; and safely deliver interventions to
participants within their own homes via remotely-supervised, caregiver-led administration of stimulation.
Building upon these preliminary studies and advances, we propose to conduct a phase II, randomized, sham-
controlled, double-blinded, parallel-arm trial to assess the separate and combined effects of tACS targeting the
left angular gyrus at gamma frequency and tDCS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on memory,
executive function, dual task gait, and instrumental activities of daily living in ambulatory older adults with mild
dementia (Specific Aim 1). Within this trial, we will also determine how much of the clinical effects of
intervention on memory on the one hand, and executive function and dual task gait performance on the other
hand, depend upon the amount of the electric field induced respectively in the left angular gyrus and the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as assessed by individualized e-field high-resolution modelling (Specific Aim 2).
This project is expected to demonstrate that tACS and tDCS can be combined into one single intervention to
optimize the functional impact of a home-based intervention for older adults suffering from mild dementia. It will
also provide insights into the specificity of mapping between brain networks and symptoms, and offer critical
foundation to enable personalized optimization of stimulation interventions within future trials."
10914658,"The overarching goal of this application is to continue to develop and strengthen the Dartmouth Cystic Fibrosis
Research Center (DartCF), reproducing in areas relevant to NIDDK mission our previous successful
trajectory of CF-related research in airway biology and infection. The Pilot Project Program (P3) is an integral
part of our strategy. In our first year of P30 funding, we have already expanded our capacity to investigate
host-microbe interactions in the gut and the impact of gut dysbiosis on CF-related diabetes and overall
systemic disease and health of these patients. The first reagents, publications and grant submissions are
emerging from our inaugural set of pilot projects. As a reflection of the growing interest in and Core support for
these research areas, our open RFA elicited 18 high-quality NIDDK-relevant proposals. From these, we have
selected a new set of four P3 projects, all in areas related to GI, systemic or liver aspects of CF. Our strategy
to build the current strengths of our research base stems directly from effective use of pilot funds over the past
~15 years. Using our experience and outstanding track record of enhancing research capacity through pilot
funds, the P3 Program will (1) encourage development of preliminary data to open up new research
opportunities, refine hypotheses, and strength proposals to compete for extramural support, (2) enhance
collaborative and interdisciplinary research to engage current researchers at Dartmouth, including those with a
record of CF research and those new to the field, and support newly recruited faculty, (3) deepen our reservoir
of translational and clinical research projects by providing funds to physician-scientists and their collaborators,
(4) nucleate the submission of multi-investigator grants, and (5) support professional development through
mentoring of junior faculty, including both basic and physician scientists. This is a proven strategy. In the past,
our CF Foundation Research Development Program (RDP) and NIH Center for Biomedical Research
Excellence (COBRE) awards leveraged $1.4M of pilot funding into $22.9M dollars of extramural grant support
over the past 14 years. Note that the COBRE sunset in 2018 and that CF pilots related to pulmonary topics
are supported exclusively by the RDP. Using this model as a framework, we have designed an inclusive
Request for Applications (RFA) and rigorous multi-stage review procedure to award P3 grants to expand our
capabilities to investigate host-microbe interactions in the gut and the impact of gut dysbiosis on CF-related
diabetes, under three mechanisms: (1) Mentored Basic or Translational Awards for junior faculty, (2)
interdisciplinary Collaborative Basic or Translational Awards, and (3) Innovative Translational or Clinical
Studies led by an MD or MD/PhD faculty investigator. All three mechanisms foster interdisciplinary, multi-
investigator, and clinically relevant research. By engaging existing and new faculty and supporting
transformative research, the P3 will directly enhance the identity, impact, and research base of DartCF."

10914670,"ABSTRACT
The function of the Epigenetics and Transcriptomics Core (Core B) is to identify the key gene networks and
cis-regulatory mechanisms that define the pulmonary endothelium as an innate immune ‘organ’ during lung injury
and repair. Core B will provide high-throughput production and optimal mining of genome-wide gene expression
and chromatin datasets, for all three projects in this Program. The Core B leader has pioneered such
approaches in stem cells and is now applying these analysis platforms to lung endothelial cells in a
comprehensive and integrative manner. We have optimized the methods for several next generation sequencing
approaches, including low cell number RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, and can effectively collect, manage,
analyze, integrate, and interpret the generated data specifically in freshly isolated endothelial cells. By combining
all four technologies we will develop a multi-dimensional view of the epigenetic programming of endothelial cells
(EC) and reveal their modulatory interactions with circulating immune cells. On this basis, Core B will provide a
foundation for the more specific and sophisticated needs of each individual project. Indeed, each project focuses
on gene regulatory networks that are among the most robustly regulated across lung injury and repair models.
Through the development and use of epigenetic and transcriptomic assays coupled with next generation
sequencing, Core B will assist each Project in uncovering the molecular mechanisms and develop testable
hypothesis about genes associated with EC innate immunity and their role in inflammatory response. These
include the exploration of the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes that occur in response to endoplasmic
reticulum localized Y143phosphorylated sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), as EC convert from an
anti-inflammatory to an immune-active lineage in Project 1; delineate the cis-regulatory mechanisms and
chromatin-based pathways that control the expression of ubiquitin E3 ligase CHFR in Project 2; and examine
the role of epigenetic programs in the initiation of lung endothelial cell mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis
as well as the downstream effectors of mitophagy-induced signals in Project 3. Ultimately, Core B represents a
central conduit for genomic and bioinformatic flow of data for this PPG, providing data-generation, data-storage
and data-sharing functions and therefore contributing significantly to further understanding the immune
regulatory function of lung endothelium."
10914673,"ABSTRACT
The focus of this Program Project is to investigate the molecular and signaling mechanisms underlying the
immune regulatory role of the pulmonary endothelial niche during inflammatory lung injury and resolution of
injury. The Intravital Imaging and Physiology Core (Core D) is essential to precisely define how dynamic
changes in the pulmonary endothelium during injury and repair programs the immune cells to either promote
or resolve inflammatory lung injury. Each Project makes clear that spatio-temporal signaling regulated by
endothelial cell-surface receptors and mitochondria is fundamentally important in regulating the endothelial
immune niche and defining the outcome of lung injury and resolution. Thus, all Projects, using endothelial-
specific genetically altered living mouse models, will address how signals emanating from basal and activated
endothelial cells alter neutrophil/monocyte/macrophage fate in response to lung injury and contribute to
resolution. Respiratory motion in the live animal represents a major obstacle for obtaining meaningful
results from in vivo imaging studies of the normally respiring lung. We have developed a novel imaging
approach to monitor pulmonary microvessels and immune cell trafficking during injury and repair. Thus, a
major Core D function will be to provide advanced two-photon intravital lung imaging expertise to reliably
quantify the activation of endothelium, to measure lung vascular leak, and to identify the role of activated
pulmonary vascular niche in regulating transendothelial migration of myeloid cells in the living mouse lung.
Each Project in conjunction with Core D will examine the functional effects of their pathways of interest
during inflammatory lung injury and repair phases. Imaging analyses will include the assessment of
transmigration of phagocytic cells and in situ phagocytic and efferocytotic activities of immune cells as
programmed by endoplasmic reticulum-localized S1PR1 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1) in endothelial
cells in Project 1; CHFR (an E3 ligase, checkpoint with Forkhead and ring finger domains)-induced
degradation of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells in Project 2; and activation of endothelial cell mitophagy and
mitochondrial biogenesis in Project 3. By providing visual in vivo examination of endothelial activity and its
impact on myeloid cell functions and physiological assessments during inflammatory injury and repair, Core
D will be essential for the Program’s success."
10914675,"ABSTRACT
Uncontrolled accumulation of inflammatory cells in the airspace paired with vascular injury causes lethal acute
lung injury (ALI). The microvascular endothelium, with which immune cells are continuously in contact with, plays
a critical role in maintaining lung homeostasis basally and after infection. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1
(S1PR1), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on the endothelial cell (EC) surface, is a well-known
mediator of “barrier protection” and “resolution of inflammation”. Here we have discovered that S1PR1 can also
trigger counterproductive signaling, thus changing the lung vascular niche. The focus of Project 1 is to identify
post-translationally modified S1PR1 as a significant molecular switch that epigenetically modifies EC from an
anti-inflammatory phenotype to an immune-active phenotype, leading to irreversible inflammatory lung injury.
Our Supporting Data show that: 1) inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα) produced during inflammatory injury
phosphorylates S1PR1 on tyrosine143 (Y143-S1PR1); 2) Y143-phosphorylated S1PR1 in turn signaled receptor
translocation and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 3) the chaperone protein BiP (Binding
immunoglobulin Protein) was essential for the translocation and binding of Y143-S1PR1 to the ER membrane, 4)
the ER-associated Y143-S1PR1 subsequently bound to the intracellular heteromeric GTP binding protein Gi, and
when activated by intracellular S1P augmented store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in a Gi-dependent manner,
and 5) rendering S1PR1 constitutively phosphorylated (by editing Y143 to D143) in EC of mice increased lung
inflammatory injury. Lung EC also gained epigenetic modifications of genes inducing vascular development and
myeloid cells differentiation and activation following injury by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting injury-
specific modulation of EC epigenome. Based on these provocative data, Project 1 will test the hypothesis that
ER-resident Y143-S1PR1 is a crucial point of confluence for key signaling events with the potential to rewire the
EC epigenome, shifting EC into an inflammatory phenotype leading to intractable lung injury. Our Specific Aims
are: Aim #1: to address the role of Y143 phosphorylation of S1PR1 in the ER positioning of S1PR1 and
reprogramming of lung endothelium, and thereby leading to inflammatory lung injury; and Aim #2: to study the
role of chaperone protein BiP interaction with Y143 phosphorylated-S1PR1 in stabilizing S1PR1 at ER membrane
and mediating the shift to inflammatory phenotype in lung EC. We will use genetically modified mice generated
using Crisper-Cas9 gene editing as well as EC-specific S1PR1 null mice and tools available in Cores such as
epigenetic analysis (Core B), multichannel cellular imaging (Core C), and 2-photon imaging of lung EC and
immune cells in living mouse (Core C) to define mechanistically how ER-resident Y143-S1PR1 in EC centralizes
these signaling events to control the fate of immune cells in the lungs. We believe studies will identify novel
markers of the immunologically active endothelium and targets for preventing inflammatory lung injury through
manipulation of ER-S1PR1 and BiP signaling."
10914676,"ABSTRACT
In Project 2 we will investigate mechanistically the role of the newly discovered endothelial cell expressed
ubiquitin E3 ligase CHFR (checkpoint with fork-head and ring finger domain) in regulating lung barrier
integrity and the innate immune function of vascular endothelial cells. VE-cadherin (VE-cad) expressed at
endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) functions as a “gatekeeper” to restrict the permeability of plasma
macromolecules and influx of phagocytic neutrophils (PMNs) into tissue. However, the key mechanisms
triggering the loss of VE-cad expression at AJs have remained elusive. Our Supporting Data show: 1) CHFR
mediates ubiquitylation of VE-cad through K48-linked polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) chains resulting in VE-cadherin
degradation, 2) genetic deletion of CHFR in human lung endothelial cells (EC) or mouse EC in vivo prevented
ubiquitylation and degradation of VE-cadherin; 3) EC-specific deletion of Chfr in mice (Chfr∆EC) also significantly
reduced the generation of the potent endothelial barrier-disrupting mediator angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2); 4) CHFR
additionally ubiquitylated AKT1 via K48-linked poly-Ub in ECs, which reduced AKT1 expression and led to FoxO1
nuclear translocation and activation; 5) EC-specific deletion of FoxO1 (FoxO1∆EC) in mice prevented the
expression of CHFR and Ang-2, and the disruption of VE-cadherin barrier; and 6) EC-specific deletion of Chfr in
mice also enhanced the ability of transmigrated PMNs to phagocytose and eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Based on these exciting data, in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that expression of CHFR in lung ECs,
downstream of TLR4 signaling, causes the loss of VE-cadherin expression at AJs secondary to ubiquitylation of
VE-cadherin through K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that TLR4-induced
CHFR expression increases FoxO1-mediated Ang-2 generation to injure directly the lung endothelial barrier
subsequent to ubiquitylation of AKT1. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CHFR-mediated loss of VE-
cadherin at AJs induces transendothelial migration of PMNs and is thus an essential host-defense mechanism
regulating bacterial elimination capacity of the transmigrated PMNs. These studies will employ a repertoire of
biochemical, molecular, in vivo real-time intravital imaging, and functional assays available in the Cores to define
how CHFR mediates the degradation of VE-cadherin and AKT1 through the ubiquitylation-dependent pathways
and its consequences on endothelial barrier integrity and innate immune function of the lung endothelium. We
will use a variety of EC-restricted knockout mouse models to accomplish the above aims. The long-term
objective of these studies is to identify and develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting ARDS via
manipulation of CHFR expression. Furthermore Project 2 will be directly integrated with the other Projects and
help to inform the innate immune function of the lung endothelium and its role in the mechanism of inflammatory
lung injury."

Studies have shown that the endothelium plays a critical role in host defense by regulating the influx and phenotype
of immune cells. Project 3 focuses on delineating the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy in endothelial
cells in regulating lung vascular homeostasis and host-defense during injury. The proposed studies will identify
mechanisms of mitochondrial injury in ECs as well as how adaptive mitophagy activates compensatory mitochondrial
biogenesis. Project 3 will also examine how mitophagy and the release of mitochondrial peptides impact neutrophils
during inflammatory lung injury. The fundamental questions that will be addressed by this proposal include: What
are the mechanisms of TNFα induced mitochondrial injury and mitophagy? Can we use biosensors for mitochondria
in vitro and in vivo to define key phases of mitophagy and compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis? How does
endothelial mitophagy affect restoration of endothelial metabolism and endothelial regeneration? How does
endothelial mitophagy impact neutrophil signaling, inflammatory injury and host defense. Project 3 will test the
overall hypothesis that lung endothelial mitophagy is a central regulator of endothelial homeostasis and the innate
immune response. This will be addressed in two Aims. Aim 1: Determine the role of endothelial mitophagy and
compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis to restore endothelial regeneration and homeostasis during
inflammatory lung injury. Here we will test the hypothesis that inflammation induces mitochondrial injury and
adaptive mitophagy in the lung endothelium to orchestrate endothelial regeneration and homeostasis. Furthermore,
we posit that the central mechanism of restoring homeostasis is through the compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis.
We use intravital two photon imaging of endothelial mitophagy (with Core D) and perform in vivo studies using EC-
specific genetic deletion of the mitophagy mediator PINK1, the mitochondrial biogenesis transcription factors PGC1α
and TFAM, and the mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5 (which transfers post-mitophagy signaling to the nucleus)
with mechanistically driven in vitro studies in human lung ECs. These studies will be coupled to analysis of EC
metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and EC regeneration. Aim 2: Determine the role of endothelial mitophagy
in activating the lung host-defense function during inflammatory injury. Here we will test the hypothesis that
EC-mitophagy increases transendothelial neutrophil influx and thereby bacterial killing through secretion of
formylated peptides and activation of formyl peptide receptors. We will use genetic models of EC-specific PINK1
deletion in distinct models of inflammatory lung injury (LPS and Pseudomonas pneumonia) and analyze EC
epigenetic and transcriptomic regulation (with Core B) wrought by mitophagy and address how these contribute to
host-defense function of EC and neutrophils downstream of EC PINK1. We will also assess how EC-PINK1 regulates
neutrophil-induced lung injury and generation of N-formylated mitochondrial peptides. We will also determine the
effects of lung EC mitophagy on neutrophil transmigration and bacterial phagocytosis (with Core D) and study the
signaling pathways (with Core C) downstream of mitochondrial formyl peptides in neutrophils."

Cephalopods have large and complex brains, and in particular a highly capable visual system.
However, their brains evolved independently from vertebrates, and very little is known about how neural
circuits in the cephalopod brain process visual information. In fact, there has never been a direct
recording of receptive fields in the central visual system of cephalopods. This study will measure
neural activity and visual coding in the optic lobe of Octopus bimaculoides, an emerging model
organism for cephalopod research. The first aim will employ two-photon calcium imaging in the optic
lobe of juvenile octopuses, combined with controlled visual stimuli, to measure receptive field properties
in large ensembles of individual neurons. The second aim will combine this functional imaging with
anatomical connectivity, identified via retrograde tracing, to determine how visual information is routed
through the visual system and into higher brain regions associated with specific behaviors. The third
aim will incorporate these experimental results into computational analysis of the visual features being
encoded, and into network models of visual processing. Together, these aims will provide direct insight
into the neural coding and functional organization of this unique visual system.
This work will be the first to describe neural computations in the central visual system of cephalopods.
Examination of a system that is evolutionarily distinct, yet functionally parallel to the vertebrate system,
has the potential to illuminate novel ways by which visual processing can be carried out. Likewise,
observation of convergence of functional organization in cephalopods, relative to vertebrates and other
invertebrates, such as Drosophila, would help identify key features necessary for the function of
complex visual systems."
10914172,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Taxanes are among the most efficacious chemotherapeutic agents and are frequently used in the treatment of
early stage and metastatic breast cancer, but are known to produce a pain condition known as chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathic pain (CIPNP). CIPNP is one of the primary dose-limiting toxicities of taxane
administration. No diagnostic tool exists to identify patients that will develop CIPNP in response to taxane
therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, this proposal seeks to develop biomarker signatures associated
with taxane-induced neuropathic pain to 1) identify patients at risk for developing debilitating taxane neuropathic
pain before chemotherapy is initiated and 2) to identify patients on treatment that are at risk of developing
neuropathic pain and need dose adjustments to prevent the onset of symptoms. Our long-term goal is to identify
biomarker signatures that can identify patients at high risk of developing taxane-induced CIPNP to enable
personalized dose adjustments to minimize CIPNP and optimize therapeutic outcomes. During the R61 phase,
we will perform genome-wide, epigenome-wide, miRNome-wide, and untargeted metabolome-wide associations
of the 11-point pain-intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy 20-
item (CIPN20), the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement System
(PROMIS) scores for physical function, anxiety, depression, and pain interference to identify novel biomarkers
associated with identifiable phenotypes (Aim 1A). Next, we will test panels of candidate mRNA and cytokine
biomarkers for their association with NRS, CIPN20, PCS, and PROMIS scores (Aim 1B). An added strength of
this study is that by collecting samples before, during, and after taxane treatment we will be able to compare
those patients who develop CIPNP to those that remain pain free, providing a better understanding of the
molecular mechanism predisposing a patient to developing neuropathic pain. R61 milestones include developing
biomarker signatures that identify patients at risk of developing neuropathic pain that compromise quality of life
(i) before taxane therapy is started and (ii) over the time course of taxane therapy. One rationale is that some
patients will have a detectable biomarker profile suggesting a high likelihood of long term (i.e., greater than 1
year) neuropathic pain and a need to either avoid or reduce taxane doses. A second rationale is that some
patients may not have a biomarker signature indicating an adverse response to taxane therapy at baseline, but
develop one through the course of taxane therapy. This biomarker signature will be used to detect these
susceptible patients early and personalize their taxane therapy to minimize CIPNP. In the R33 phase (Aim 2),
we will use machine learning to develop and validate algorithms using biomarker signatures from associations
with phenotypic changes from Aim 1 (A and B) to predict individuals at risk of developing CIPNP and to identify
patients who are at risk of developing an adverse profile as taxane therapy is administered."

Gene regulation is central to all life, normal and diseased. The long-term goal of this research program is to un-
derstand the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of all genes in yeast and human systems. This
basic knowledge will help produce better diagnostics and treatment options for people. Regulation of the hu-
man genome is very complex. Therefore, this research program is focused initially on the simpler yeast Saccha-
romyces to experimentally dissect mechanisms of gene regulation that are fundamental and common to all eu-
karyotic life. Concepts developed in yeast are ultimately tested in human cells, thereby accelerating discovery.
 This research program has developed an ultra-high-resolution assay called ChIP-exo to map the bound
locations of essentially any protein throughout any genome at base-pair resolution. Using this strategy, a com-
prehensive first-of-its-kind epigenome map of the protein-DNA architecture of yeast cells was established. This
is now being established in human cells. The epigenome is defined here as the compilation of all molecular in-
teractions with DNA and RNA, beyond base-pairing. The next phase of this research is to understand the func-
tional interactions among the protein components of the epigenome. This will be achieved in part through dele-
tion, mutation, and/or rapid depletion of protein components of the epigenome, particularly those involved in
inducible and constitutive transcription. The former is gene-specific and can be hyper-expressed in response to
specific signaling events. The latter is general to most genes and typically occurs at low levels. Importantly, the
research program here is defining the protein architecture that specifies inducible versus constitutive promot-
ers. Once protein components of this architecture are experimentally removed (e.g., sequence-specific tran-
scription factors or their cofactors), then the impact of this removal will be measured on chromatin organiza-
tion, loading of the core transcription machinery and subsequent transcription. A parallel strategy will be em-
ployed in human tissue culture cells to assess conserved paradigms.
 This research will also continue with its previous biochemical reconstitution of chromatin organization
across entire genomes using purified proteins, but now adding in components of the transcription machinery
and their regulatory factors. A biochemical system will provide greater control over the experimental parame-
ters and therefore provide greater insight into molecular mechanisms of gene control. It is now clear that in-
duced genes coalesce in 3D space within the nucleus. However, it remains unclear which genes coalesce into
which hubs. Therefore, 3D mapping technologies like SPRITE will be adopted to measure gene clustering. This
will provide insight into how multiple genes become coordinately induced by regulatory signals. Taken to-
gether, the product of this research program will be a detailed molecular understanding of transcription and its
regulation."

Disparate access to genetic services among ethnic minorities and those with low socioeconomic
status has marginalized the most vulnerable populations, particularly children with rare
diseases. About one-third of children with rare diseases die before they reach their fifth birthday.
There are significant inequalities in genetic services that children currently receive along the
Texas-Mexican border in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) where many of the citizens are
underserved and uninsured. While genomic information to improve health outcomes is being
integrated in clinical practice elsewhere in the country, significant barriers exist in this
impoverished and medically underresourced region of Texas that prevent delivery of essential
genetics evaluation. Prioritizing equity and inclusion in health care, we propose to implement
one of the first academic web-based virtual clinics called Consultagene in the underresourced
regions of Texas to provide clinical evaluation of pediatric rare diseases through front-line
clinics. A multidisciplinary team at University of Texas Health Rio Grande Valley clinic and
Baylor College of Medicine will clinically evaluate 100 ‘hard to diagnose’ children with rare
diseases, with goals of accelerating access to care and intervention. Genome sequencing (GS)
will be completed as a first-line test to deliver rapid diagnoses and reduce the time to diagnosis
for clinical decision-making. We will also build genomic competency of front-line healthcare
providers through use of facial recognition technology and education to expedite referral of
pediatric patients with suspected rare diseases. If successfully modeled at the primary partner
site (UG3 phase), the strategy will be implemented at Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center (TTUHSC) in El Paso, along the US-Mexico border (UH3 phase). Our ultimate goal is to
advance genetics evaluation of pediatric rare diseases in remote marginalized areas of Texas
for improving health outcomes and providing avenues for targeted intervention."

challenges in translational research in IDD. The PCO Core will provide investigators with a battery of validated
assays for rodents and humans, with a focus on creating a translational pipeline, as well as harmonizing
measures across studies. In addition, the PCO Core will provide access and training on the use of additional
behavioral assays that will allow IDDRC investigators to perform critical secondary or follow-up studies to
better understand the nature of any behavioral abnormality detected with a primary behavioral test battery. The
Animal Phenotyping & Preclinical Endpoints sub-core provides resources for investigators to perform
behavioral assessment across various domains in rodent models. This core also focuses on development of
robust preclinical outcome measures for assessment of potential interventions, serving as surrogate endpoints
in treatment paradigms for potential therapies. The animal phenotyping sub-core provides high quality, cost
effective behavioral assessments in rodent models, expert consultation for experimental design and data
analysis and training investigators to conduct behavior assessments independently. It also offers educational
workshops on various topics and data analysis, technical issues, trouble-shooting and development of novel
assays as preclinical outcome measures. The Human Phenotyping and Neuropsych Measures sub-core
provides neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric assessment tools, comprising questionnaire-based methods,
structured clinical interviews, and task-based measures. Some of the innovative approaches provided by the
human phenotyping sub-core includes a novel computer vision-based technique for quantifying dynamics of
facial expression, posture, and gaze (""automated multimodal analysis""), and bio-behavioral sensing, to move
beyond traditional assessment approaches. Investigators can access consultation and guidance regarding
developing phenotyping batteries, which may involve the creation or utilization of novel approaches. They can
also access training and/or supervision in implementing and analyzing varied tasks, together with quality
assurance resources. The human phenotyping sub-core will also provide direct service in implementing
tailored phenotyping approaches for mental health conditions frequently prevalent in IDD. Finally, investigators
can access consultation regarding building animal to human models of disease state to facilitate translation.
Thus, the PCO Core's set of unique resources and broad expertise provides IDDRC Investigators a cost-
effective and flexible means for conducting cross-species translational research in IDD.

services, and an efficient centralized infrastructure, to create an environment that is optimized for conducting
outstanding research into Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. The Core is divided into three main
functional units: Scientific Leadership, Education and Dissemination, and Administrative Support. With input from
an integrated Scientific Advisory Board, the Executive Committee of the Core will set the scientific priorities of
the Center, conceptualize and help develop new research directions and provide opportunities for a
multidisciplinary group of investigators to interact. The leadership team will set priorities for Core funding and
utilization, evaluate cost effectiveness and core quality. The Core will support trainees and early stage
investigators by creating a wide range of educational opportunities within the university, emphasizing
translational research, and in partnership with the other West Coast IDDRCs, develop technical workshops and
research symposia to provide excellent training in translational research. The core will organize mechanisms for
dissemination of research findings to the broad community, and will emphasize minority outreach, and will build
ties with stakeholders and advocacy groups. Finally, the Core will serve as the administrative hub for scientific
support and resource oversight. It will coordinate and oversee core utilization, quality assessment and cost

10915522,"Clinical Translational Core: Abstract
The mission of the Translational Clinical Core of the UCLA IDDRC, established in 2015, is to support high quality,
multidisciplinary, collaborative clinical translational research advancing knowledge of causes, prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). To accomplish this, the Core will
provide research consultation; access to reduced cost, specialized, research quality diagnostic and phenotypic
assessments; recruitment support; training; data management; and other aids for IDDRC investigators bridging
clinical research with basic science. The Core is engaged in advancing assessment methods for IDD research
through innovative measure development, evaluation, and dissemination. The Core also supports outreach,
biospecimen banking, and data management. In addition, the Core will participate in IDDRC Network and other
IDDRC-related multi-site clinical investigations.
 Over the past 4 years, the Core has successfully established effective procedures for support of ongoing
and new clinical IDD studies, nearly doubling the number supported during that timeframe, and has contributed
new phenotyping measurements to the field. The Core has been impactful in supporting several new studies by
early career investigators new to clinical studies. In this renewal, we are strengthening the Core by adding two
new Core Co-Investigators (Drs. Catherine Lord and Rujuta Bhatt Wilson) who bring special expertise in social,
diagnostic, behavioral, motor, and neurological assessments, IDD intervention trials, longitudinal studies, and
large-scale training on gold standard diagnostic instruments. Core support is leveraged to achieve substantial
cost efficiency, reducing individual project costs and by removing burdens of training, quality control, and
maintenance of reliability from individual studies. Core access then enables expansion of research efforts and
enhances quality of UCLA IDDRC research by establishing uniformity in diagnosis, phenotyping, and conduct of
clinical studies. Measurement development efforts, utilizing sophisticated analytics such as Item Response
Theory and machine learning, are aimed at addressing methodologic gaps that have plagued prior clinical
research efforts relating to IDDs, and foster new research by providing tools better suited to capturing clinical
manifestations of underlying biology, hence advancing clinical translation. Our training aims to build capacity for
IDD research. Our team is especially well suited for advancing assessment approaches for use in minimally
verbal individuals, and very young children at risk for IDDs, a strength of our team. Core investigators are well
known for measurement and paradigm development, lifespan studies, and studies of higher functioning subjects
across a range of IDDs."

Sleep impairments are ubiquitous in IDDs, and sleep problems profoundly impact quality of life and
neurodevelopmental outcomes. The Center proposes a model research project, focused on the mechanisms
underlying sleep impairments in IDDs using a multidisciplinary approach that includes a clinical component,
animal models, and brain organoid models using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. This project
builds on findings from our previous IDDRC model project and the cells and circuits core, inspired by two striking
findings: (1) in Dup15q syndrome, our investigators discovered profoundly abnormal sleep
physiology, characterized by abnormal sleep spindles and attenuated slow-wave sleep (SWS), among patients
who had undergone overnight clinical, with magnitude of these EEG abnormalities correlated with the degree of
intellectual disability and (2) in Rett syndrome organoid models, our investigators quantified abnormal oscillatory
activity in the earliest stages of development. For this project, we take a fully translational approach to study
mechanisms underlying neural oscillations and sleep in Dup15q and Rett syndrome. In Aim 1 (Clinical), we
verify abnormalities in sleep physiology (SWS and sleep spindle density) in clinical EEGs of young children with
Dup15q syndrome and examine their relation to cognitive function. In Aim 2 (Preclinical model), we examine
sleep physiology (SWS and spindles) and its effect on hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity in mouse
models of Dup15q and Rett syndrome, performing EEG and simultaneous electrophysiological recordings and
calcium imaging using a novel miniaturized microscope. In Aim 3 (Preclinical model), we investigate early
neural network function in human cortical, subcortical, and hippocampal organoids from derived from Dup15q
and Rett Syndrome iPSC using calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings techniques, and transcriptomic
analyses. This project leverages our center's strengths in both clinical and preclinical investigation of syndromic
IDDs and capitalizes on active scientific collaborations between basic and clinical researchers in our center to
understand sleep physiology, a fundamental and understudied problem in IDDs. By verifying the relationship
between NREM sleep abnormalities and behavior in children with these syndromes and then, in model
systems, determining the network and cellular basis of abnormal neural oscillations that are critical for memory
formation and learning, this project will directly inform next steps for development of timely, effective treatments
that may modulate sleep and, in turn, improve neurodevelopmental outcomes."
10915526,"CORE C: Abstract
The Genetics, Genomics, and Informatics Core (GGIC) focuses on the application of genome-
level analyses in neuroscientific investigation, both at the sequence (genetic), gene expression
and epigenetic (genomics) levels. The explosion of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based
methods has made advanced computational expertise and infrastructure needed for all
sequencing-based applications. The proposed Core aims at providing support for basic and
advanced genetics and genomics experiments in both patient cohorts for translational studies and
experimental models for basic research. Modern genetic and genomic approaches rely on
sequencing technology and require substantial bioinformatics expertise and access to solid
computational resources. This Core leverages a proven history of expertise, as well as support
and collaboration with other investigators in the Gandal and Geschwind groups with regards to
computational and informatics resources funded by NIH and private foundations. Based on this
proven track record, the Core will provide IDDRC investigators with the necessary expertise and
infrastructure to perform high-throughput, genome-wide genetic and genomic studies. State-of-
the-art analytical methods will be used to analyze NGS, gene expression, chromatin accessibility
(e.g., ATAC-seq), methylation, and single cell/nucleus scRNA-seq data, and the resulting
datasets will be posted onto a database accessible to IDDRC investigators, facilitating data
sharing and collaborative analyses. Over the past 15 years, UCLA computational biologists and
statisticians have lead the field of integrative data analysis (Geschwind and Konopka, 2009) and
network-based methods (Oldham et al., 2008; Parikshak et al., 2013; Zhang and Horvath, 2005).
Further, over the past 5 years, IDDRC investigators have published pioneering work interrogating
the functional genomic landscape of human brain development, including the first comprehensive
atlas of single-cell gene expression in the mid-gestation human brain (Polioudakis et al., 2019),
high-resolution mapping of non-coding regulatory elements driving human neurogenesis with
ATAC-seq (de La Torre Ubieta et al, 2018), and large-scale expression and splicing quantitative
trait loci (QTL) profiling in fetal brain (Walker et al., 2019). Expertise in the development and
implementation of these methods (including single-cell analysis, network methods, and integrative
approaches) will be made directly available to IDDRC investigators."
10915528,"CORE D: Abstract
The purpose of The Cells and Circuits Core is to provide investigators with tools needed to understand the
cellular and physiological basis of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) and the role of potential
therapeutics in IDD biology. Electrophysiological assessment is a vital to the understanding of both cellular and
circuit alterations in models of IDD and cell culture is a vital tool in the understanding of cellular and molecular
basis of ID. The core will consist of two components, the Neurophysiological Assessment component and the
Cellular and Organoid Modeling component. In the Neurophysiological Assessment component, we will provide
functional assessments at the cellular, circuit and systems level. The use of state-of-the-art electrophysiological
approaches will aid IDDRC investigators in uncovering and understanding basic mechanisms causing the
disorders being studied. These electrophysiological approaches consist of experiments performed in brain slices,
acutely isolated neurons or cultures providing functional analyses of changes in neurons, local circuits and
microcircuits induced primarily by genetic alterations in cellular, mouse or rat models. New techniques include
optogenetics, EEG and local field potential (LFP) recording in vivo, and the use of miniscopes to image neuronal
calcium transients in freely-behaving rodents to permit and facilitate analyses of developmental neurological
functions at the cellular, circuit, and systems levels. In the Cellular and Organoid Modeling component, we will
develop and provide models of IDD using human pluripotent stem cells, tissue-derived neural stem cells, and
three-dimensional organoid cultures. Because human central nervous system cells are inherently different from
rodent cells, we developed the facilities and capabilities to propagate and distribute them 2 cycles ago. In the
previous cycle, we expanded the human cell core greatly, with a focus on pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures,
including building the basis for the study of human cerebral organoids. We continue to provide these tools and
expand our ability to deliver cells and expertise to ID researchers serving as a proxy to estimate neuronal activity
in more ethological conditions. The use of stem cell technology provides a novel approach to modeling disease
and developing rationale therapies based on utilization of human cells. The Core will provide facilities and
expertise to propagate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), neural
stem and progenitor and other cerebral cell types to create and study cellular models of IDD. A major function of
the Core will be to aid investigators in culturing and studying cerebral organoids derived from hESCs and hiPSCs.
In addition to its training and service functions, the Core will continue to develop novel methodologies in
physiological assessment and human cell culture and analysis. The two components of the Core will interact
seamlessly. The Core will interact regularly with the other Cores of the IDDRC and with the Research Project
and will also aid investigators in drug discovery and development through interactions with Molecular Screening
Shared Resource in the Broad Stem Cell Research and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Centers."

Abstract
The Structural and Functional Visualization Core provides comprehensive imaging services to the
members of UCLA Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC), working
on any aspect of the genetic and environmentally-induced developmental diseases affecting
nervous system development and function. The research ongoing in the UCLA IDDRC spans
basic scientists using reductionist approaches to elucidate the mechanisms specific to intellectual
developmental disabilities (IDDs) to clinicians assessing therapeutic interventions for patients. To
accommodate all of their imaging requirements, we provide access to three light microscopy
cores, including a microscopy suite dedicated to IDDRC researchers, human and animal MRI
facilities and the technical support needed to initiate and complete any imaging analysis.
 The Structural and Functional Visualization Core also works to develop new technologies
for visualizing biological samples and in turn provide them to IDDRC researchers. In this proposal,
we are focused on [1] developing smaller lighter one-photon miniaturized fluorescent microscopes
for live imaging neural activity in freely moving animals and [2] refining the methods for CLARITY
and iDISCO, protocols that render tissue transparent thereby permitting unparalleled visual acuity
into the complex circuitry of the brain. These techniques offer the promise of a holistic approach
to imaging, permitting IDDRC researchers to translate mechanism into therapy. For example,
researchers investigating a specific intellectual disorder will be able perform MRI on patients to
identify the affected region of the brain, implant miniaturized microscopes in rodent models to
perform Ca2+ imaging in vivo to examine how the firing patterns of specific populations of neuron
are mechanistically altered by the disease, while concomitantly examining putative aberrant circuit
formation using light microscopy coupled with CLARITY.
 Finally, this core also supports the efforts of all the other cores, offering IDDRC
researchers the ability to both probe molecular and cellular function at any level from the sub-
cellular to living animals and determine the consequence of therapeutic interventions."
10915568,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The basal ganglia have a rich somatotopy and functional topography composed of motor subcircuits that are
thought to be critically important to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) and successful application
of deep brain stimulation therapy (DBS) for managing each cardinal motor sign of PD. There is a strong clinical
need to better understand these processes and in turn harness them to deliver therapy that is tailored to a
patient's own symptomatology and motor control needs on a moment by moment basis. This project will
investigate how spatiotemporal optimization of DBS settings can differentially affect neural pathway activation
through the brain's motor control network and how those results translate to improving each of the four cardinal
motor signs of PD (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability). Aim 1 will investigate at the single
cell, ensemble, and network levels how spatiotemporal parameters of DBS influence information transmission,
and critically how the motor control network is able to produce naturalistic movements despite information
lesions induced by high-frequency stimulation. Aim 2 will develop and apply a Bayesian Dual Adaptive Control
algorithm to investigate how spatiotemporal DBS settings affect electrically-evoked compound action potentials
and how those features map onto modulating individual motor signs. Aim 3 will leverage the ground-truth
electrophysiological data from high-density microelectrode array recordings at the site of DBS and within the
motor control network to validate key parameters used in computational models of neural pathway activation
with DBS therapy. The proposed study integrates innovative high-density microelectrode array recordings,
closed-loop optimization algorithms, micron-resolution anatomical pathway imaging, and subject-specific
computational models of DBS. Together, this project will enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of
PD and provide critical data towards translating next generation personalized and responsive DBS therapies."
10909150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a critical public health problem. Heart failure (HF)
affects over 5 million adults in the United States (US), and is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and
impaired quality of life. Approximately half of individuals with HF have a preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection
fraction (EF), termed HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). While there are several effective pharmacologic
therapies for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), none have been identified for HFpEF. There is an
urgent need to identify therapies that target mechanisms of pathophysiologic progression of HFpEF.
Hypertension, which is present in approximately 80% of individuals with HFpEF, is the foremost modifiable risk
factor for the development and progression of HFpEF. Despite the clinical importance of hypertension in
HFpEF, there is limited information on how common antihypertensive agents, particularly calcium channel
blockers (CCBs) and β-blockers, effect pathophysiologic mechanisms of HFpEF. We propose a novel
mechanistic investigation of the role of dihydropyridine CCBs compared to β-blockers in targeting key
physiologic abnormalities in HFpEF.
HFpEF is characterized by unique physiologic abnormalities that may be differentially impacted by β-blockers
and CCBs. Excessive β-adrenergic stimulation may be a driver of reduced aerobic capacity in HFpEF, which
may respond favorably to β-blockade. However, in HFpEF, β-blockers may reduce cardiac output, particularly
during exercise, contributing to impaired cardiac output reserve and aerobic limitations. β-blockers may also
have effects on the pattern of ventricular contraction and arterial load, impacting diastolic function. Similarly,
CCBs may have beneficial effects related to vasodilation and reduction in late systolic load beyond their BP-
lowering effect. However, CCB-induced vasodilation at rest may limit the vasodilatory reserve. Our goal is to
assess the mechanisms by which CCBs and β-blockers (commonly used antihypertensive agents in clinical
practice), impact aerobic capacity and quality of life in HFpEF. We will compare the impact of a dihydropyridine
CCB (amlodipine besylate 5-10mg daily) vs. a β-blocker (metoprolol succinate 100-200mg daily) on arterial
function, chronotropic reserve, vasodilatory reserve, and LV function, among 50 subjects with HFpEF in a
randomized cross-over trial design. Participants will receive 4 weeks of each intervention, with a 1-week
washout period in-between. Our mechanism-driven approach will enhance our understanding of the
pathophysiology of HFpEF and characterize the physiologic potential of these common antihypertensive
agents to reduce progression and improve symptom management in this disease."

This K08 proposal describes a five-year career development training program in tumor immunobiology. Dr. Navin
R. Mahadevan has completed clinical training in Anatomic and Molecular and Genetic Pathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School (HMS), and will pursue this research program with the goal of
transitioning to an independent laboratory-based career investigating cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms of
immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment, along with a minor component of clinical service in diagnostic
molecular pathology.
 In this training program, Dr. Mahadevan will develop further expertise in the study of tumor
immunogenicity, and acquire new skills in the areas of antigen discovery and high-resolution slide-based
expression profiling, which will critically inform his future studies. His mentor, Dr. David Barbie (Associate
Professor of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and HMS), is an leader in the field of translational
tumor immunology with an excellent track record in mentoring trainees, including those who have successfully
become independent laboratory-based faculty at major academic centers. Dr. Mahadevan has also assembled
an Advisory Committee with complementary expertise in tumor immunology (Drs. Sharpe and Rodig),
epigenetics and immunotherapy (Dr. Uppaluri), and computational genomics (Dr. Van Allen), and extensive
experience in mentoring physician-scientists to independent careers. Dr. Mahadevan will further supplement his
training with didactic courses to deepen his scientific knowledge, leadership, and communication, and will
regularly present his work at national and international meetings.
 The primary objective of Dr. Mahadevan’s proposed research is to elucidate the immunologic
vulnerabilities of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Dr. Mahadevan provides preliminary data identifying an
immunogenic subtype of SCLC that depresses MHC Class I (MHC I) antigen presentation and may be
responsive to immune checkpoint blockade in patients. This proposal will leverage this new understanding of
SCLC immunobiology to rationally elucidate immunologically vulnerabilities of these distinct SCLC subtypes.
 Immunologic and functional assays will be employed to test three independent but related questions
following from this hypothesis: (1) the tumor microenvironmental consequences of MHC I derepression by SCLC;
(2) the sensitivity of MHC I low SCLC to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity; (3) the epigenetic regulation and
potential immunogenicity of MHC I-restricted antigens derepressed in MHC I high SCLC. These studies will lead
to a deeper understanding of distinct SCLC immunophenotypes and attendant anti-tumor immune responses,
which could lead to the identification of novel biomarkers and development of effective immunotherapies for this
treatment-refractory disease."
10909673,"Compared with White women, Black women are 3 times more likely to develop fibroids and experience more
significant symptoms, have higher hospitalization rates, and are more likely to schedule a uterine-sparing
treatment. Although uterine-preserving treatment approaches can often effectively manage symptoms during the
early disease experience, hysterectomy rates are 2-4 times higher among Black women compared with White
women. The reasons for this difference remain unclear. Clinical considerations, such as uterine size, only
partially explain the disproportionately higher rate of hysterectomy among Black women. Timely diagnosis and
early treatment represent crucial steps in UF care and may contribute to observed racial disparities in treatment
and outcomes. Differential delays in diagnosis or treatment initiation for Black women with UF compared with
White women could result in longer duration of UF progression and growth, higher rates of care complications,
and fewer treatment options. We know little about the UF care pathways, including the need for urgent services,
like hospitalization, for symptoms. We also do not know to what degree community-level characteristics
contribute to racial disparities in UF care patterns and outcomes. This proposal builds on existing knowledge
about racial disparities in UF treatment patterns (e.g., uterine-sparing vs. hysterectomy) by comparing UF care
pathways among Black and White women living in a variety of neighborhood settings. This proposal will clarify
how care timeliness is associated with differences in treatment patterns and the excess morbidity experienced
by Black women. Our project complements the other projects in the Partnering for Equity: An Academic and
Community Alliance to Eliminate Disparities throughout the Fibroid Experience (PEACE) Center
examining UF etiology (Project 2) and patient experience (Project 3) and will be under the advisement of the
Center’s Community Stakeholder and Advisory Board (CAB). Our experienced team will conduct the proposed
study of care pathways for symptomatic UF among >27K Black and White Michigan Medicaid enrollees and will
leverages data from detailed health records of >13K Black and White individuals in Southeastern Michigan
between 2016 and 2024. The Aims are to 1) compare UF care intervals between Black and White Medicaid
enrollees with symptomatic UF, 2) determine if the relationships between care interval duration and
urgent health service use differ between Black and White individuals and 3) determine if neighborhood
resources affect the relationships between race and care interval duration or urgent health service use.
Impact and significance. Findings from this large, longitudinal analysis of a racially and socioeconomically
diverse group of individuals with UF can assist efforts to target care processes to reduce racial disparities in UF
treatment and health outcomes through clinical care programs, health system design, or health policy. By
achieving our proposed aims, we will identify potentially modifiable care processes and structural factors that
could be targeted by future interventions."
10909674,"Uterine leiomyomata, also known as uterine fibroids (UF), are benign neoplasms of the uterus and are associated
with heavy menstrual bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain, infertility, and complications of pregnancy. In the United
States, the lifetime risk of UF exceeds 70%. UF are the leading indication for hysterectomy. UF represent one of
the biggest health disparities of all conditions affecting women. Black women have greater UF incidence, earlier
age at first diagnosis and surgery, and more numerous and larger symptomatic tumors on average than White
women. Factors associated with UF incidence and growth are poorly understood and reasons for the racial
disparity are neither well understood nor empirically verified. Our project will investigate how life course stressors
affect risk of UF incidence and growth by applying the Stress Process Model in a cohort of Black individuals. We
will investigate how stressors from multiple pathways affect UF incidence and growth among Black women.
Since its inception in 2010, the NIEHS-funded Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF) has carried out
>8,000 clinic visits during a 10-year period among >1600 Black women living in the Detroit area with the goal of
defining the natural history of UF and identifying environmental risk factors for UF incidence and growth. SELF
enrolled women 23-34 years of age who self-identified as Black/African American, had never been diagnosed
with UF and conducted assessments with transvaginal ultrasounds at enrollment (baseline) and 4 follow-up visits
(5 total clinic visits; 84% retention after 10 years). At each study visit, SELF participants completed
comprehensive in-person interviews and transvaginal ultrasounds for UF measurement, facilitating accurate and
precise tracking of UF development, growth, and characteristics (e.g., number, location, and size). During 10
years of follow-up, 764 participants had at least 1 UF detected by study ultrasound (n=379 incident UF).
Questions about stressors (PSS-4) and adverse life events (including during childhood) were collected at every
study contact. We will re-contact SELF participants to obtain a lifetime residential history and additional
information on stressors (Major Experiences of Discrimination) and “positive resources” including coping,
resilience, religious involvement and social connection across the life course. We will calculate the Index of
Concentration of Extremes (ICE), Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and Childhood Opportunity Index 2.0 (COI2.0)
to describe Community Level stressors for each participant based on address to achieve the following: Aim 1:
Assess the associations between repeated measures of self-reported stress and adverse life events over time
with UF incidence and growth using existing data collected during 10 years of follow-up; Aim 2: Determine the
contribution of additional stress pathways (Major Experiences of Discrimination, ICE, ADI, COI 2.0, family
socioeconomic status (SES)) queried as part of the new SELF recontact to UF incidence and growth; Aim 3:
Determine the role of positive resources with the associations between lifetime experiences of adverse life
events, personal stressors, and discrimination and UF incidence and growth (Aims 1 and 2).

Project 3, entitled “Centering Patients: Development of a Tailored eHealth Intervention to Improve the
UF Patient Experience”, focuses on understanding the drivers of racial disparities in UF care and developing
an individually-tailored intervention to improve patient experiences. As with the overall Center, this project will
be guided by the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research under the direction of our Community
and Stakeholder Advisory Board. Our preliminary data from Black patients with UF indicate that they are often
dissatisfied with both their own understanding of UF as well as the care they receive. They want to be at the
center of their care. Interventions are needed that support patient autonomy and move toward a more patient-
centered care model. The overall objective of Project 3 is to conduct formative work to understand the
knowledge, attitudes, norms, beliefs, emotions, and lived experiences of Black women with UF and use these
insights to develop an individually-tailored digital tool to optimize UF care for future implementation and testing.
The digital tool will also convey key patient-reported information to providers to ensure that they are aware of
patient knowledge gaps, emotions, treatment preferences, and reproductive plans. To achieve this, we
propose three Aims:1) Quantitatively explore knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors around uterine
fibroids as well as reproductive health more broadly amongst U.S. Black and White women; 2) Qualitatively
explore experiences of UF patients and providers; and 3) Develop an individually-tailored, interactive eHealth
intervention to increase knowledge, mitigate barriers, improve self-efficacy, and facilitate optimal patient-
provider communication. Project 3 will develop a culturally-tailored, personalized intervention that we believe
will decrease disparities in the fibroid patient experience that significantly and negatively impact Black women.
However, once created, the individually personalized tool will improve the uterine fibroid patient experience
generally - positively impacting all women."

The PEACE Center’s Community Partnership, Outreach and Education Core (CPOEC) will be an integral part
of the proposed center and will help guide and direct all aspects of the Center’s activities to ensure equitable
benefit from innovative research findings. The CPOEC will engage all Center components: the Research
Projects, the Executive Committee, Steering Committee, and the Administrative Core. CPOEC activities will
accelerate the typical timeline of research by creating dialogue from the outset on research questions that are
inherently relevant to key stakeholders, including clinical and public health practitioners as well as patients and
community members. The CPOEC seeks to address the significant health disparities of uterine fibroids (UF),
which disproportionately affect Black women, in part as a direct result of discrimination, racial disparities in
access to care, as well as differential knowledge and attitudes about UF and their treatment. Engaging the
communities at risk with culturally competent and strategic partnerships is expected to make a significant impact
on reducing UF disparities. The overall objective of the CPOEC is to facilitate a new coalition between academic
researchers and community organizations and stakeholders with ties to Black women – partnerships that will be
empowered to creatively and organically study ways to address health disparities in uterine fibroids using a
community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. The activities and products of the CPOEC will be
significant to patients, clinicians, and researchers as we currently have limited data on the full spectrum of
challenges faced by those most burdened by UF. The core’s aims were created by our community partners and
Community and Stakeholder Advisory Board (CAB). The CPOEC aims are as follows: 1) Establish a community-
academic partnership with the capacity to conduct CBPR on UF health disparities and pathways to health equity;
2) Provide UF health education, outreach, and increase community members capacity for CBPR and health
equity research via local, regional, national, and social networks; 3) Ensure equitable dissemination of PEACE
Center progress and findings; and 4) Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the PEACE community-
academic partnership in equitably engaging all partners."

This proposal is a request to support the 16th International Society of Bone Morphometry meeting (ISBM2024),
which will provide a platform to discuss the latest development in skeletal imaging and analysis and provide
workshop sessions. This meeting will take place on September 30 – October 3, 2023 at the Chestnut
Conference Centre at University of Toronto (Toronto, Canada), immediately following the American Society for
Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting (September 27 – 30, 2023, Toronto, Canada). The
goal of ISBM2024 is to provide a forum that discusses both conventional and novel morphometry-based
approaches, organize training workshops lead by academic and industry experts, enhance training experience
and career development of junior investigators, and promote scientists from underrepresented groups. Since
its inception, ISBM meetings have always fostered collaboration, discussion of scientific data, and training for a
diverse range of basic, translational, and clinical scientists from around the world using morphometry-based
approaches. In ISBM2024, in addition to the discussion of scientific progress by researchers, the meeting will
seek to address emerging challenges in bone morphometry, such as the need to establish or update guidelines
on new bone morphometry approaches, dissemination of knowledge, protocol, and large data sets, and the
lack of participation from underrepresented groups. The proposed conference plan is carefully developed to
address these challenges, and composed of eight scientific sessions, networking hours, social events, and
training workshops. The topics of eight scientific sessions cover both basic and clinical aspects of skeletal
imaging and morphometry. New to this meeting, which traditionally has only provided training sessions in bone
morphometry, a presentation and discussion on open access and science in musculoskeletal research will
precede prior to training workshops. We anticipate the attendance of the ISBM2024 meeting to be 100 – 150
participants. Funds are requested to cover travel awards for young investigators and trainees, costs of the
conference venue, and to support travel and accommodations for invited speakers. We anticipate ISBM2024 to
provide a forum to present and discuss the latest morphometry approaches, train junior investigators, discuss
guidelines for bone morphometry techniques to advance the rigor and reproducibility, and promote inclusion of
underrepresented groups. The conference will foster a greater understanding of existing challenges and
potential path forward to future research to enhance rigor and reproducibility in bone morphometry."
10915464,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Throughout evolution and history humans have progressively isolated themselves from the natural cycles by building
artificial habitats that shield them from the external environment. This has vastly affected when and how much humans
sleep, especially since the near universalization of electric light. The key to this isolation and change in sleep patterns is
the ability to manipulate artificial light and extend activity into the nighttime. A recent study from our laboratory found
that the timing of sleep changes across the moon cycle, with later and shorter events of night sleep on the nights leading
up to the full moon. Surprisingly, we found this lunar cycle modulation not only in rural but also in urban environments.
Sleep is controlled by two simultaneous processes: the circadian clock determines the optimal times for sleep
throughout the 24-h cycle while the homeostatic drive for sleep increases as we stay awake. The two processes combine
to determine the natural human patterns of night sleep. This project aims to determine which of these two
mechanisms that regulate sleep is affected throughout the moon cycle to delay and shorten sleep on the nights
before full moon. We will combine longitudinal field recordings of sleep and sleep laboratory strategies to address the
following two aims:
Specific Aim 1: Assess circadian phase at opposite phases of the moon cycle in Toba/Qom communities. We will
conduct longitudinal monitoring of sleep in rural and urban native Toba/Qom communities in northern Argentina. In
individuals with robust lunar patterns we will assess the phase of the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO), the gold-
standard for determining circadian phase in humans, in the days leading to the full and new moons. Our hypothesis is
that the phase of the circadian clock is modulated across the moon cycle, and predicts that the DLMO phase will be
delayed on the days preceding the full moon relative to the pre-new moon days.
Specific Aim 2: Assess circadian phase, and circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep at opposite phases of the
moon cycle in a highly urbanized community. We have already confirmed that this lunar modulation is present even in
industrialized societies, where artificial light during the evening reigns over the full moon’s light. We will screen Seattle
participants through longitudinal sleep monitoring and select those with the most robust lunar rhythms to participate in
sleep laboratory visits twice at the opposite phases of the moon cycle. We will use polysomnographic wake and sleep
recordings, as well as a constant routine protocol to study the potential lunar monthly change in circadian phase and in
the homeostatic regulation of sleep after sleep deprivation.
Whether the moon can affect sleep has been a matter of high controversy for decades. Our recent work demonstrated
that sleep patterns vary across the moon cycle in a very predictable manner in real life conditions, in very different
populations and under different environments. This project aims to shed light on the mechanisms through which this
modulation occurs, which will further our understanding of the regulation of human sleep, and its impact on health and
disease."
10915625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorder is a condition in which the placenta fails to separate partially
or totally from the uterine wall, resulting in significant intrapartum maternal morbidity and mortality at delivery.
Depending on the extent of the placental invasion into surrounding tissue, hysterectomy may be lifesaving.
Assessment of PAS severity prior to delivery is crucial for multidisciplinary surgical planning and patient
counseling. However, there is an unmet clinical need for quantitative, objective measures of abnormal
placentation that can serve as predictors of risk of invasion and hysterectomy. The overall goal of the proposed
project is to prospectively assess PAS in high-risk women across gestation using quantitative multi-parametric
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and automated textural radiomics and to correlate findings with surgical
outcomes.
 Coming from a highly interdisciplinary background of MR chemistry, biology, and physics, the
candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with in-depth knowledge and skills
to conduct translational placental imaging research. The candidate's short-term goal is to complete a pilot
study under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary advisory committee to evaluate PAS in women with high-risk
pregnancies using multi-parametric MRI and textural radiomics.
 To meet these goals, the following research aims are proposed: 1) Evaluate placental invasion across
gestation using multi-parametric MR imaging and deep learning based novel quantification tools in PAS high-
risk pregnancies, and 2) Extract the radiomic pattern across gestation of high-risk PAS placenta and determine
its association with clinical surgical outcome. These research aims will serve as the platform for the career
development plan and training aims which include: 1) Gain knowledge in translational prospective research
design, 2) Improve technical skills in advanced clinical MR acquisition development, 3) Acquire applied
statistical and data analysis skills, and 4) Develop mentorship and leadership skills while under training.
 Together, the research and training aims will provide the training, experience and preliminary data for
an R01 application. The future R01 will develop a clinical and surgical outcome prediction model for high-risk
PAS pregnancies, potentially improving maternal and fetal outcomes. The training will position the candidate to
become a leader in translational placental imaging research."
10915471,"Project Summary
Suicide is an alarmingly common cause of death for people living with psychosis. Conservative estimates suggest that
at least 5% of people with psychotic spectrum disorders complete suicide, accounting for approximately 11% of suicides
worldwide or nearly 100,000 suicides each year. The absolute risk of suicide remains high even for people who are
engaged in specialty psychosis treatment, and interventions that have been designed specifically to prevent suicide in
people with psychosis have shown limited impact.
One important suicidogenic factor for people with psychosis is emotion dysregulation, which is the failure to regulate
emotion resulting in problematic emotional states. Emotion dysregulation is a core feature of psychotic disorders and
yet this factor is commonly neglected in treatments provided to this population. Research has shown that emotion
dysregulation is closely linked to suicide in people with psychosis and emotion regulation is a primary target of some of
the best-established and most effective psychosocial interventions for suicidality in other populations, most notably
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), but relevant clinical trials routinely exclude people with psychosis. The goal of this
K23 is to conduct a prepilot and pilot randomized controlled trial of group DBT skills training (DBT-ST), an intervention
that targets emotion regulation, in a sample of people with psychosis and heightened suicidality. This pilot study would
allow us to determine feasibility, acceptability, and obtain preliminary estimates of the impact of DBT-ST on key
outcomes.
A critical component of this work is the use of a rigorous methodology for measuring emotion dysregulation. Such
measurement has seen advances in recent years in the form of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) which
enables the direct statistical modeling of emotion dysregulation without reliance on retrospective self-report. To further
increase rigor and reproducibility, we propose to pair such ecological measurements with qualitative assessments of
participant experiences of EMA data collection to aid in the construction and interpretation of sophisticated statistical
models of emotion dysregulation in psychosis that account for non-random missingness as well as exogenous variables
that may confound measurement of the impact of DBT on emotion dysregulation. This mixed methods approach will
allow us to better assess how DBT-ST might improve emotion regulation in people with psychosis. The proposed study
will pave the way for a larger trial evaluating whether treatment of emotion dysregulation can decrease suicide risk in
psychosis.
The above research proposal will be carried out within the University of Maryland Division of Psychiatric Services
Research—an institution with a strong track record of successful clinical trials research with people with serious mental
illness—and will be paired with mentorship and training in the areas of (1) the conduct of experimental clinical trials with
serious mental illness, (2) suicide-focused clinical research, and (3) the multimodal measurement and modeling of
intervention effects."
10914391,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
High-quality research designs have demonstrated that voice therapy has a positive impact on hyperfunctional
voice disorders associated with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). Among the options of behavioral voice
therapy for MTD, one of the most effective evidence-based approaches is flow phonation (a.k.a., stretch-and-
flow voice therapy). However, the phenomenon of post-treatment outcome measures remaining substantially
outside the range of normal is a ubiquitous finding in studies investigating this and other voice therapy
approaches. From both a cost burden and quality of life perspective, this phenomenon supports a need to
develop and refine voice therapy treatment approaches to promote better outcomes. Vibration is a physical
modality that has a historical use in the rehabilitation professions, but only recently has it been scientifically
studied as a modality for voice therapy when used by speech-language pathologists. When applied locally on
the perilaryngeal surface as a local translaryngeal vibration therapy (LTLV), early research has demonstrated
beneficial effects on voice physiology and clinical outcomes. Further high-quality clinical research studies are
needed to evaluate the efficacy of LTLV as a modality for voice disorders and to better understand the effects
of vibration and effective vibration dose on voice rehabilitation outcomes. The research proposed in this R15
has the potential to transform clinical practice of treatment for MTD, the most common voice disorder among
treatment-seeking populations. That potential is vested in the pursuit of three specific aims: (1) determine the
clinical efficacy of LTLV as a concurrent treatment using flow phonation voice therapy in patients with MTD,
and (2) determine the effect of treatment dose on clinical response associated with treatment outcomes. In
addition to the potential impact of this R15, the innovative of approach of using LTLV as a concurrent modality
with flow phonation combined with investigation of the most effective frequency parameter for clinical
application represents a pioneering approach to advance the field of clinical voice practice in speech-language
pathology."
10916484,"Project Summary
Respiratory viral infections represent a major risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress
syndrome. Moreover, severe influenza injury can result in ineffective repair and persistent loss of pulmonary
function. The lung endothelium, especially the microvasculature, is damaged due to the robust inflammatory
response from viral infections, but the mechanisms of pulmonary endothelium regeneration after severe
influenza injury are not completely elucidated despite the vasculature’s central importance in gas exchange. This
proposal aims to answer fundamental questions about pulmonary vascular regeneration regarding the origin of
vascular progenitor(s) and the mechanisms driving endothelial repair in response to influenza injury. We recently
demonstrated that COUP-TFII, a vein-specifying transcription factor enriched in proliferating endothelial cells, is
necessary for lung regeneration. The venous endothelium is increasingly recognized as a vascular progenitor
population for endothelial regeneration in various organs in zebrafish and mice, suggesting that pulmonary veins
/ venules may similarly harbor potent progenitor cells. In my own preliminary data, I observed that venous
endothelial cell clones are highly proliferative and can span into the microvasculature. Aim 1 of this proposal will
utilize clonal lineage tracing and orthotopic transplantation techniques to determine if the venous endothelium
harbors potent progenitor and proliferative potential during lung regeneration. The second focus of this proposal
is to elucidate the mechanisms and interactions that are required for endothelial proliferation. Along with
expression of venous markers, proliferating endothelial cells secrete C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), a
chemokine involved in mediating the inflammatory response during injury. The CCL2-CCR2 signaling axis
promotes inflammatory angiogenesis in mice through recruitment of monocyte derived inflammatory
macrophages, indicating a role for endothelial-specific release of CCL2 during tissue repair. Therefore, Aim 2
will employ conditional, temporal deletion of CCL2 in endothelial cells and clodronate-liposome mediated
depletion of macrophages to investigate if loss of endothelial-derived CCL2 impacts endothelial proliferation and
consequent angiogenic repair. This proposal will address the central hypothesis that a pulmonary endothelial
progenitor population present in the preexisting venous endothelium secretes CCL2 to recruit interstitial
monocytes to provide an angiogenic niche. Completion of this project will validate the venous endothelium as an
important contributor to pulmonary regeneration and will also facilitate identification of specific paracrine /
immune pathways that could allow for precise regulation and preservation of the beneficial immune response."
10916543,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The medical and non-medical use of opioids and other psychoactive drugs in women of childbearing age is
a significant public health concern in the United States. Prolonged in utero exposure of the developing fetus to
maternal opioids often results in Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) after delivery. Infants with
NOWS may have mild signs of withdrawal that minimally impact their ability to function or they may have
significant withdrawal that requires a prolonged course of pharmacologic therapy and a lengthy newborn hospital
stay which stresses families, communities, and the healthcare system. Prolonged hospitalization may result in
decreased maternal and infant bonding and attachment and have a negative impact on neurodevelopmental and
behavioral outcomes of affected children. The prevalence of opioid use during pregnancy and the subsequent
occurrence of NOWS after delivery is disproportionately higher in rural and underserved areas. Kentucky is a
highly rural and underserved state and has an estimated rate of NOWS that is approximately three times the
national average.
 Despite the significance of this problem, the clinical care for neonates with NOWS is complicated by a lack
of nationally accepted standardized approaches which leads to significant site-to-site variation. Such variation is
due in part to a lack of generalizable evidence to inform clinical practice. Previous research has been limited by
both small sample sizes, due to difficulty with recruitment and retention, and inherent limitations in study designs.
In order to identify the most effective treatment and thereby optimize the care of infants with NOWS, a direct
comparison of pharmacologic treatment regimens in a generalizable population is urgently needed.
 Collaboration with local community partners and with other clinical sites will be undertaken within the
proposed research consortium to design, implement, and conduct a multicenter randomized controlled clinical
trial. The goal of the trial is to provide a direct comparison of pharmacologic treatment for infants with NOWS,
account for confounding variables such as non-pharmacologic care and adjuvant medications and evaluate
neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in the first years of life. The anticipated results of this RCT will be
highly generalizable to improve care for infants with NOWS in KY and throughout the nation."

10919860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Biospecimen and Pathology Core of the Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE provides an expert
centralized pathology consultative service and a comprehensive resource of breast tissues, blood and “living
samples” for preparation of organoids and patient-derived xenografts, linked to epidemiological and clinical
data. The Core also curates clinically derived benign and neoplastic breast tissue samples with detailed
clinicopathological evaluation (e.g., stage, histologic features, clinical and emerging biomarker assessments) to
establish registries and cohorts for research. Samples collected include fresh, fresh-frozen, cryopreserved and
formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens from 1) treated or untreated breast cancers with mapped
background “benign-adjacent” tissues, 2) lymph node metastases and distant metastases, 3) benign breast
disease tissues across the spectrum of pre-neoplasia and 4)“normal” breast tissue harvested from
mammoplasty/risk reduction specimens from patients with or without clinical or genetic “high-risk” factors (e.g.
known germline BC predisposition gene mutations), as well as blood. The Core performs expert pathological
evaluation of research- related histopathological parameters (e.g., atypia in benign breast disease, involution
status of breast lobules, histologic subclassification of TNBC, evaluation of tumor response to neoadjuvant
therapy, stromal and intratumoral TIL scoring). In addition, the Core performs antibody optimizations as
required by the SPORE projects (e.g. PKCBeta1), followed by interpretation and scoring of these
immunohistochemical stains, and application of digital image-based approaches (e.g., optimization and
interpretation of digital image analysis algorithms with Aperio (Leica) (or HALO (Indica Labs) software systems,
high-plex quantitative digital spatial profiling (e.g. Nanostring GeoMX™ platform) for SPORE projects. The
Core coordinates with the Mayo Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing (BAP) Shared Resource to store
fresh-frozen and cryopreserved specimens and to process blood samples to provide genomic DNA and serum
and plasma aliquots; it collaborates with the Mayo Pathology Research Core (PRC) Shared Resource to obtain
essential technical tissue-based services including conventional and cryostat tissue sectioning,
immunohistochemistry, tissue microarray construction, slide scanning and cytotechnologist assistance for
optimizing digital imaging algorithms. Partnering with these institutional shared resources minimizes
redundancy of services and capitalizes both on technical experience and state-of-the-art technologies."

 The Outreach Core (OC) will be a multi-faceted arm of NeuroTech Harbor (NTH) to seek out high-risk, high-
reward technology ideas in the neurotechnology fields. Building on the Equitech mission and vision of NTH, we
will foster an inclusive environment where the brightest, most responsive neurotechnology ideas from anywhere
or anyone in the US will be guided towards clinical and commercial success. NTH is committed to diversity and
inclusion during early-stage translation as a major critical step towards creating long-term clinical and social
impact. To execute our outreach plan, we present the following aims: (Aim 1) To perform rigorous needs
assessments on an annual basis, driven by both primary and secondary research, to inform solicitations. (Aim
2) To drive broad awareness with targeted marketing of solicitations and generate high quality responses. (Aim
3) To form an NTH Institute for education and innovator leadership to increase success of innovators and as a
pipeline for founding teams with women and URM inclusivity.
 For each solicitation cycle, we will work with our Steering Committee and Governing Board to (i) identify
technology gaps in diagnostics and therapeutics for disorders of the nervous system, mental health and aging,
(ii) identify needs for solutions in specific areas from a clinical perspective, and (iii) understand the needs of
underserved patients, families, and advocacy group partners. We plan to synthesize and create solicitations that
balance each stakeholder's perspective and needs. An initial needs assessment and solicitation are complete.
 Building on our prior experience with outreach for incubators and accelerator programs at Johns Hopkins
University (JHU) and Howard University (HU), we will broadly communicate our solicitation launch with a
comprehensive marketing and communication strategy. We will make coordinated efforts to ensure prospective
applicants meet the criteria of solicitations by providing high customer service with “Pitch Days” for directed
feedback and with educational assistance on proposal writing. Our goal is to continuously improve our
responsive rate. Given the challenges when embarking on early-stage translation, we are ready to serve and
prepare Innovators for the journey, with a focus on the inclusion of women, Black, LatinX, and communities of
color.
 To do so, we will create an NTH Institute to educate, train, and level the playing field for Innovators from low-
resource environments. The Institute will curate all learning elements (e.g., workshops, boot camps), tackling
topics including translation readiness, commercialization, professional development, and project management.
It will also launch a “Spark” program targeted to all STEM students across the HBCUs and minority serving
institutions (MSIs) to introduce the neurotech field and the opportunities it unveils. To further enhance the
diversity of Innovator teams and meet our goals for inclusion, we will facilitate team building by working closely
with the Evaluation Core to create a closed feedback loop with solicited proposal Innovator teams. Finally, we
will invite the BP consortium and their communities to participate and gain from the NTH Institute.

10919817,"PROJECT SUMMARY EVALUATION CORE
 NeuroTech Harbor's (NTH) Evaluation Core (EC) is a critical element of the NTH. The EC will be responsible
for providing thorough, timely evaluations of a large number of innovator proposals and identify those few that
have a high potential for clinical impact and commercial viability. In addition, the EC will identify gaps in proposals
that help innovators improve, as well as guide future steps on reapplying to NTH or other BP Hubs. The EC must
not only ensure that the need addressed in a proposal is significant, but also that a feasible plan is viable and
laid out to achieve deliverables, including resources required. Since NTH will receive a broad range of
applications, the EC will recruit top experts to adequately evaluate proposals. Finally, the EC will recruit experts
from diverse backgrounds, a core value of NeuroTech Harbor. Lastly the EC will assess and provide guidance
in ways innovators can increase the potential for commercial success globally by expanding their impact to
under-served communities.
 To help manage this complex task, the NTH EC will leverage the Consortia for Improving Medicine with
Innovation & Technology's (CIMIT's) Guidance and Impact Tracking (GAITS) web-based platform to (i) help
innovators prepare competitive proposals, and (ii) provide a methodology for all EC panels, especially the Deep-
Dive panel, to assess subproject proposals with consistent criteria. The EC will provide applicants and panel
members with basic training on how to use the GAITS platform. To recruit diverse specialists covering topics of
all submitted proposals to serve on our evaluation panels, the EC will work with NTH's Consultant Network, and
leverage The LaunchPort, a MedTech manufacturing accelerator, with an extensive network of diverse experts.
 The EC aims are: (Aim 1) To implement a rigorous, unbiased, and efficient evaluation process that identifies
neuromedical solutions with high potential for commercial success and clinical benefit. (Aim 2) To deploy a
proposal management platform to facilitate evaluation of subproject and subaward proposals as well as
preparation of proposals. (Aim 3) To facilitate building a pipeline of diverse aspiring innovators. The evaluation
process is inspired by the RADx model and the NIH peer review system and will include industry experts who
will appraise the feasibility of the total lifecycle of proposed solutions. Evaluation will occur in three stages: Triage,
Viability, and Deep Dive. Short preproposals will be evaluated during Triage, and full proposals will be evaluated
during Viability and Deep Dive. Full proposals will be assessed using GAITS criteria and NTH's new equity &
accessibility criteria. The Deep Dive stage will involve intensive interaction and multiple feedback cycles with
proposers and reviewer. To facilitate evaluation and management of subproject and subaward proposals,
NeuroTech Harbor, in partnership with VentureWell (VW), will provide an online portal for applicants to submit
their applications and for reviewers from the EC, Steering Committee, and NIH personnel to review and comment
on proposals."
10919863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the DRP is to support innovative and scientifically meritorious research projects that can be translated
into clinically important applications impacting diagnosis and management of breast cancer to decrease the
burden and mortality from this disease. The DRP will: 1) encourage and solicit innovative translational laboratory,
population, and clinical study proposals; 2) encourage and support interdisciplinary collaboration in translational
research in breast cancer; and 3) generate new hypotheses that can be tested in larger-scale research projects.
This support will expand the research portfolio of the SPORE. The Developmental Research Program will provide
$50,000 direct costs for one year ($25,000 from SPORE funds and $25,000 from Mayo Clinic Cancer Center) to
each of six projects. Additionally, the DRP will provide an additional $25,000 direct costs/year for each of the 5
years to support one project led by an investigator from an underrepresented racial and ethnic group. This will
be matched with an additional 25K from the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center or our collaborating institutions,
University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center and Emory Cancer Center. In all cases, there will be the
expectation of a second year of support contingent on sufficient progress. A process has been established
involving a call for applications and a formal peer review utilizing the expertise of the Internal Scientific Advisory
Committee and other experienced investigators. Criteria for selection of projects for funding are based upon
scientific merit, originality, qualifications of the applicant, and translational potential. It is expected that support
of developmental research projects will result in generation of data that will serve as the basis for additional
SPORE-sponsored projects or support through peer-reviewed external grant support. The three main metrics for
productivity of the DRP are advancement of DRP projects to a full Project in the SPORE, acquisition of extramural
funding, and publications by the project awardees. There have been 41 DRP awardees with four awards being
made on September 1, 2020. Six of the eleven SPORE projects in the current grant (two), previous grant (two),
and renewal (two) have a Co-Leader who was a DRP awardee. The 36 DRP awardees (before September 1,
2020) have obtained 17 R01s, nine Foundation grants, three Komen grants, one State of Minnesota grant, one
R21, one American Association for Cancer Research grant, one American Cancer Society grant, one Eagle’s
grant, one Regenerative Medicine Minnesota grant, and three Breast SPORE Career Enhancement Awards, in
addition to the five awardees who have advanced to Co-Leadership of a full project in the Breast SPORE. These
36 awardees have published 115 manuscripts related to their DRP projects in peer-reviewed journals. The DRP
has been highly successful in identifying cadre of investigators that has expanded and enriched the scientific
portfolio of the SPORE and provided a mechanism for development of Co-Leaders in full Projects."
10910999,"Background: Antimicrobial overuse is one of the strongest risk factors for the emergence of antimicrobial
resistance, an urgent public health problem. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are hospital-based
programs that can reduce unnecessary inpatient antimicrobial use and are therefore an essential tool for
addressing the crisis of antimicrobial resistance. ASPs are mandated in VHA.
Significance: VHA hospitals are only required to monitor their inpatient antimicrobial use. However, at least
40% of antimicrobial exposure associated with a VHA hospital stay is prescribed at hospital discharge and is
taken by the patient after discharge (i.e. post-discharge). These post-discharge antimicrobial prescriptions are
frequently unnecessary or sub-optimal. Reducing post-discharge antimicrobial overuse will minimize patient
harm, such as Clostridioides difficile infections, antimicrobial resistance, and adverse drug events.
Innovation and Impact: This proposal will address two critical gaps in the literature. First, standard ASP
metrics do not capture post-discharge antimicrobial use and therefore miss a substantial amount of hospital-
related antimicrobial exposure. This proposal will evaluate factors that contribute to variation in post-discharge
antimicrobial use across patients and hospitals in order to inform both metric development and the design of
future stewardship interventions. Second, while there are evidence-based strategies for safely reducing
inpatient antimicrobial use, it is unclear how current inpatient ASP activities can decrease post-discharge
antimicrobial overuse. This proposal will explore how inpatient ASP infrastructure, which all VHA hospitals are
expected to have, can be leveraged to reduce unnecessary post-discharge antimicrobial-prescribing.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify factors that contribute to variation in post-discharge antimicrobial use in VHA
acute-care admissions across all facilities by evaluating potential patient-level, hospital-level, and
environmental effects. Identify hospitals that have low observed-to-expected post-discharge antimicrobial use,
low risk-adjusted inpatient antimicrobial use, and perform well on clinical outcomes in antimicrobial-treated
patients. Aim 2: Determine whether being admitted to a hospital with a discharge-focused stewardship process
is associated with less post-discharge antimicrobial exposure, after adjusting for differences in case-mix, ID
expertise, inpatient antimicrobial exposure, and the intensity of inpatient ASP activities. Aim 3: Using qualitative
methods, evaluate attitudes and processes that impede or foster reductions in unnecessary post-discharge
antimicrobial use. We will perform site visits at 6 high- and 4 low-performing sites, as identified in Aim 1.
Methodology: Aim 1 will use VINCI data and linear mixed models to identify factors that influence post-
discharge antimicrobial use. Aim 1 will also rank hospitals on their performance on inpatient and post-
discharge antimicrobial use plus associated clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will leverage VINCI data and
findings from a mandatory hospital-level stewardship survey conducted in VHA during November 2020. We will
evaluate the effect of a discharge-specific stewardship process on post-discharge antimicrobial use. In Aim 3,
we will conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders at 10 hospitals to explore determinants of
post-discharge antimicrobial overuse and perceptions of the post-discharge antimicrobial use metric that we
developed in Aim 1. Our approach will be based in the i-PARIHS framework.
Next Steps/Implementation: The standardized hospital-level metrics we develop in Aim 1 could be
incorporated into an interactive ASP dashboard our Patient Safety Center of Inquiry has already built and is
pilot-testing in VISN 23. Our findings from Aims 2 and 3 could be incorporated into future stewardship surveys
within VHA while informing the processes local ASPs choose to implement to reduce post-discharge
antimicrobial overuse. Our findings could serve as the basis for a multicenter, audit-and-feedback trial focused
on stewardship at hospital discharge and future work around re-designing ASP processes at discharge."
10911000,"Project Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is one of the most common sleep disorders
among U.S. military Veterans. Unfortunately, most VA sleep programs have not been able to keep
up with Veterans’ ever-increasing demand for OSA assessment and treatment.
Project Objectives: The objective of this proposal is to compare a health care delivery model, Direct Referral
for Apnea Monitoring (DREAM), with initial in-person (IP) encounters for Veterans at risk for OSA. The central
hypothesis of the proposed research is that the DREAM clinical pathway can improve Veterans’ access to
sleep services by reducing wait times for home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) and OSA treatment while
maintaining prognostic accuracy that is comparable to IP assessments. We will test our central hypothesis and
accomplish the objective of this proposal by pursuing the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Compare the time from referral to sleep testing and treatment of OSA in Veterans in the DREAM vs. the
traditional clinical pathway, which includes an initial encounter with a care provider.
Aim 2. Compare positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence and patient-reported clinical outcomes in Veterans
with and without an initial sleep provider encounter.
Aim 3. Determine the negative predictive value of home sleep apnea testing
Significance of the Proposed Research and Relevance to Veterans’ Health: OSA is associated with
increased risk for hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and premature
death. Improving Veterans’ access to OSA assessment and treatment will improve the quality of
their sleep and the quality of their lives.
HSR&D Priority Areas: 1) Improving Veterans’ healthcare access via telehealth implementation; 2) Testing
new models of care to improve access, cost, and/or outcomes; 3) Design and testing of implementation
strategies to improve uptake of effective practices and quality of care.
Innovation: This approach is innovative because, (a) the use of the DREAM clinical model in lieu of initial IP
consultation for OSA evaluations is novel; (b) using electronic medical record data to triage Veterans directly to
sleep studies is a new application of this technology.
Project Methods: This study is a pragmatic, prospective, observational study that compares a health care
delivery model (DREAM) which is based on data stored in patients’ electronic medical records (EMRs), with
initial in-person (IP) clinic encounters for Veterans at risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients referred
to the participating sleep medicine clinics for OSA will undergo HSAT as appropriate, with subsequent in-lab
sleep testing if the home study is negative. Patient-reported outcomes will be measured at baseline and 3-
months. Adherence with treatment and utilization data will be collected at 3-months.
Expected Results: Compared to the initial IP pathway, DREAM will result in significantly shorter wait times for
Veterans to receive assessment and treatment for OSA. Also, rates of positive diagnostic sleep apnea studies
will be statistically equivalent in Veterans assigned to DREAM compared to those who attend initial in-person
appointments. Adherence to OSA treatment in the DREAM condition will not be inferior to initial in-person
consultation; patient outcomes and satisfaction will not be inferior in the DREAM versus the in-person arm.
Next Steps: If the DREAM model demonstrates efficacy for reducing Veterans’ wait times for OSA diagnosis
and treatment, steps will be taken to implement the procedure in medical centers and clinics throughout the
VHA system."
10911115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The proposed study will examine insurance coverage for acupuncture therapy using both quantitative and
qualitative methods, with the long-term goal of running interventional studies focused on insurance design that
can improve access to safe and effective pain care. After decades of reliance on prescription opioids for chronic
pain, the recent and widespread reduction in opioid prescribing is a welcome change. However, it is critically
important that patients with chronic pain conditions like chronic low back pain (cLBP) have access to safe,
effective, and affordable pain care. Acupuncture is an evidence-based treatment alternative for patients with
cLBP, but its insurance coverage is inconsistent, making acupuncture cost prohibitive relative to other forms of
pain care. Our first aim will measure trends in acupuncture use among a cohort of patients with cLBP using a
national sample of claims data, then examine characteristics of patients who use acupuncture and identify other
forms of pain care that they use in conjunction with acupuncture. We focus on patients with cLBP because it is
one of the most common complaints cited by patients who engage in acupuncture; it is also the most common
indication covered by insurers, including Medicare. In our second aim, we will evaluate the role of insurance
design on acupuncture use, specifically the impact of cost sharing like copays, coinsurance, and deductibles,
which have been shown to affect health care utilization at large and pain care in particular. A third aim will
contextualize the claims-based findings with qualitative interviews with insurers and pain care providers,
including acupuncturists, who will help us develop and refine an insurer-driven interventional study to encourage
patients to engage in evidence-based pain care, like acupuncture therapy. While there are myriad ways to
improve access to pain care, this project focuses on the role of insurance design and cost sharing. In terms of
career development, this grant will support a training platform that will allow the candidate to reorient from
behavioral health services research to acupuncture, pain care, and integrative health services research. An
interdisciplinary mentorship team will oversee the following training goals: (1) Carefully review the research on
the role of integrative medicine in comprehensive pain care, with a focus on acupuncture. (2) Develop an in-
depth knowledge of the role of insurance coverage in pain care and identify empirical strategies to study how
insurance design affects acupuncture use. (3) Learn how to conduct qualitative research that complements the
candidate's strengths in health economics and claims-based research. (4) Build a knowledge base in
interventional study design to propose a follow-up study that involves insurer-driven randomized trials that test
whether alterations to insurance design affects the use of acupuncture. Through the training and research
activities proposed in this K01, the candidate will become an expert in insurance coverage for acupuncture, gain
a skillset in qualitative methods and interventional study design, and begin working toward her goal of translating
research into actionable changes in policy or practice to support patients with chronic pain."
10911116,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Dystonia is a debilitating movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions with abnormal
and repetitive movements, postures, or both. The current treatments for dystonia, consisting of oral
medications, botulinum toxin injections, and deep brain stimulation surgery, fail to improve symptoms in more
than a third of patients despite optimal management. The improvements are often unpredictable. Recent
studies found exercise therapy primarily involving muscle stretching, muscle relaxation, and range of motion
exercises, when added to optimal medical management, further improved symptoms of focal cervical dystonia.
But the clinical outcomes were noted to be variable and modest. These studies did not investigate the
pathophysiological underpinnings that could explain the variability of treatment outcomes. They did not
include progressive resistance training that has the potential to induce central brain changes. The main goal of
this proposal is to investigate the brain adaptation effects for progressive resistance exercise-focused cervical
and shoulder training (PERFECT) in patients with focal cervical dystonia, which is the most common form of
dystonia. We will use functional MRI (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques for
understanding the pathophysiological underpinnings. We will randomize patients into PERFECT plus
standard-of-care (SOC) group and SOC alone group. Participants in the PERFECT + SOC group will perform
personal-trainer-guided exercises twice a week for six months. Participants in the SOC group will continue
receiving standard pharmacological therapies at stable doses, and they will not exercise. We will use fMRI and
TMS techniques to examine brain effects. We hypothesize that the PERFECT program in focal cervical dystonia
will improve the functioning of dystonia circuitries involving the sensorimotor cortex. In Aim 1, we will
determine the brain adaptation changes in response to PERFECT at six months compared to baseline with
fMRI. We will record seed-based functional connectivity and bold oxygen level-dependent signal in the
sensorimotor network. In Aim 2, we will determine the brain adaptation changes in response to PERFECT at
six months compared to baseline with TMS. We will use a TMS-based paired associative stimulation protocol to
measure sensorimotor plasticity and compare. We will monitor the TMS-based resting motor threshold; motor
evoked potential, intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation as additional measures. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether the brain adaptation response relates to clinical and functional change. We will assess with
blinded dystonia ratings, cognition and mood measures, muscle strength, physical functioning capacity. The
outcomes of this proposal will (1) test whether a 6-month long resistance exercise is viable, (2) identify
physiological brain markers that are responsive to effects of resistance exercise and are specific to dystonia
circuitries, (3) provide essential data to for planning a large scale clinical trial."

Over the next decade, more than 70% of people living with HIV (PWH) will be older than 50. The increasing
burden of the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia has al-ready
begun to present key challenges to effective HIV care among aging PLWH, including sexual minority men
(SMM). Because these NCDs often present together as comorbid conditions, interact with each other
adversely, and are inflected by social and structural inequities, they may comprise a synergistic epidemic
(syndemic). In the U.S., there are substantial racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the
prevalence and/or control of NCDs and HIV. Intersecting stigmas, such as racism, classism, and
homophobia, may drive these health disparities through direct and indirect mechanisms. Directly,
intersectional stigma in healthcare settings may contribute to healthcare avoidance, decreasing success
rates along HIV and NCD syndemic continua of care domains of retention, treatment, adherence, and
disease control. Indirectly, experiencing intersectional stigma may lead to a psychosocial syndemic of stress,
depression, violence, and substance use, thereby contributing to HIV and NCD incidence, prevalence, and
poorer disease control. Very few if any studies have prospectively assessed the contribution of
intersectional stigma to social disparities in NCD syndemic incidence, prevalence, and control among
PWH; and few if any studies have rigorously assessed how the psychosocial syndemic may mediate
pathways between social position and syndemic NCD and HIV outcomes. Collecting data over a four-year
period, we will utilize the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study, the longest-running cohort study of HIV+
and HIV- SMM in the U.S., to assess the following specific aims: 1) assess relationships between social
position, intersectional stigma, and the psychosocial syndemic among middle-aged and aging HIV+ and
HIV- SMM; 2) assess relationships between social position and NCD syndemic incidence and
prevalence; and 3) assess relationships between social position and HIV and NCD syndemic continua of
care outcomes, mediated by intersectional stigma and the psychosocial syndemic. Our scientific premise is
that multiply marginalized populations experience disparities in NCD syndemic incidence, prevalence, and
control, which are mediated by intersectional stigma and the psychosocial syndemic. The proposed work
will extend intersectional stigma and psychosocial syndemics research on the HIV continuum of care to the
NCD syndemic continuum of care. This proposal aligns with NIH high priority AIDS research areas outlined in
NOT-OD-15-137 (“addressing the impact of HIV-associated comorbidities”) and with NHLBI RFA-HL-21-018,
which calls for multifactorial research using syndemics frameworks to characterize clustering of heart,
lung, blood, and sleep conditions within PWH. This study will provide critical data for informing the
development of integrated, multilevel interventions intended to remediate disparities in NCD incidence,
prevalence, and control among middle-aged and aging SMM, particularly SMM of color and PWH."

Our brain is the most complex system under study. It relies on precise wiring and signaling across billions of
neurons. Our neurons span centimeters, communicating with one another via a sea of sub-micrometer synapses
and nanoscale proteins. At the same time, each of our neurons has a distinct type, stemming from its unique
expression of thousands of genes, and can assemble into spatial gradients with other neurons that span entire
regions of our brain. Charting vast multi-dimensional maps of our brain is one of the greatest challenges of
modern neuroscience, with far-reaching implications for shedding light on the mechanisms of brain function and
improving our ability to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the size and scale of these maps is
unprecedented, as they require us to see the big (i.e., the entire brain) and the small (i.e., individual synapses,
proteins, and RNA transcripts) in a highly multiplexed manner (i.e., many molecular markers). A growing number
of recent innovations in tissue processing, including tissue expansion for microscopy (physically enlarging
tissue), multiplexed antibody labeling (protein mapping), and in situ sequencing (reading out mRNA in tissue
using sequencing by synthesis), now make it possible to visualize hundreds of molecular entities in three
dimensions across centimeter-scale tissue volumes at resolutions that exceed the diffraction limit. At the same
time, the cost of data storage and computation continues to decrease according to Moore’s law. These
breakthroughs open the door to a new frontier of scientific discovery that is not bounded by our ability to
interrogate the molecular contents of tissue, or store and process the resulting imaging data. This frontier is
instead severely bounded by our current imaging technologies and the rate at which we can collect high-
resolution, highly multiplexed data from large tissue volumes. Here I propose to develop a pair of Exa-scale
Tissue Readout Methods (ExTReMe) that overcome this boundary and improve imaging throughput by orders
of magnitude over current state-of-the-art approaches. I will develop a first ExTReMe platform to enable a new
type of molecular interrogation of neural circuits, mapping individual proteins at molecular resolutions, in a highly
multiplexed manner, across entire brains. I will develop a second ExTReMe platform to scale in situ sequencing
methods to larger mammalian brains. Mapping neuron types across the macaque or human brain will be
accomplished in several months or years, as opposed to several decades or centuries. These new imaging tools
will transform our understanding of the brain’s cell types and their connections and provide detailed molecular
fingerprints of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Although this project focuses on applications in brain
research, both ExTReMe platforms will have broad impact in other fields, including but not limited to oncology,
immunology, and developmental biology."

Recent meta-analyses have found that participation in the appropriate fall-prevention exercise program for an
older adult reduces the risk of falls by 23% in relative terms, for an absolute reduction of 0.20 falls per person
per year. Many guidelines, including the US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF), recommend that older
adults at risk of falls are referred to appropriate fall-prevention exercise programs (USPSTF Level B). Despite
this evidence, many older adults do not receive appropriate referrals and support for fall-prevention exercises,
with one study finding that less than half of older persons report discussing their falls with their primary care
providers (PCPs). Older people living in rural areas are more likely to fall but are less likely to participate in fall
prevention programs. Advances in computing technology can help to identify older people at risk of falls and
disseminate guidance about the most effective interventions using clinical decision support (CDS) systems.
Patients can be supported in their exercise programs through a patient-focused App distributed through the PCP
or through content on their patient portal. Well-implemented CDS that is integrated into the electronic health
record (EHR) can support prescribing or recommending effective strategies and engaging patients in fall
prevention decision-making thus integrating evidence-based guidelines into clinical practice. The long-term goal
of our research program is to enhance the safety of community-based older adults by reducing falls through an
effective patient-centered learning health system called eSTEPS (electronic Strategies for Tailored Exercise to
Prevent FallS). With eSTEPS, an exercise algorithm will be integrated into the EHR which will trigger a Best
Practice Alert (BPA) and Smart Set to provide actionable CDS within primary care clinic workflows and facilitate
the use of CDS with patients to ensure evidence-based recommendations are tailored to patient preferences.
The resulting fall prevention exercise care plan will be sent to the EHR as a note and to a patient-facing App for
the patient to view after their visit.
In this proposal we will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to accurately
identify older adults at risk for falls. We will then develop, CDS implemented into the electronic health record
that helps primary care providers and older patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan. We will
conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the
eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely adopted Epic EHR will support
dissemination of evidence for older adults, with a focus on rural elders."
10911922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: The PI, a Medical Oncology Fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), has
developed a 5-year career development plan that builds upon his scientific background in immunology and
clinical training in medical oncology. He will conduct the proposed research under the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey
Ravetch, an internationally recognized expert in Fc receptors (FcRs). He will also develop new skills in antibody
and tumor biology that are critical for his future career focused on understanding the mechanisms that mediate
effective responses of cancer immunotherapies. The PI has planned to address the necessary training and
mentoring required for his successful transition to independence through select coursework and a robust
mentoring plan. The institutional environment of MSK, The Rockefeller University, and an Advisory Committee
composed of leaders in the field will not only ensure that the PI’s research project progresses as planned, but
also the PI’s transition to independence as a physician-scientist with his own laboratory and grant funding. This
research project is also sufficiently different from his mentor’s to avoid competition or overlap.
Research Plan: Antibodies targeting immune checkpoints lead to long-lasting clinical responses in a variety of
malignancies. However, many patients fail to respond to these therapies and new targets that enhance antitumor
immunity are under active investigation. CD47 is a “don’t eat me” signal overexpressed on several types of
cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. Its expression protects tumor cells from phagocytosis by
interacting with SIRP-alpha (SIRPα), a cell surface receptor expressed on myeloid cells (i.e., macrophages and
dendritic cells). Antibodies blocking the CD47/SIRPα pathway enable myeloid-mediated phagocytosis and tumor
cell elimination, leading to effective antitumor effects in preclinical studies and early clinical trials. The PI studies
have focused on understanding the mechanism of action of antibodies targeting the CD47/SIRPα axis, in
particular the contribution of the antibody Fc domain and its binding to FcRs to induce effective antitumor
responses. Preliminary data presented in this proposal show that a) Engagement of FcRs by the Fc domain
modulates the activity of anti-CD47 and anti-SIRPα antibodies, and b) Fc-optimized anti-CD47 antibodies
increases antitumor immunity and infiltration and of tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells, and other
immune cells. The goal of this proposal is to understand the role of specific FcγRs in mediating effective antitumor
responses using a novel humanized mouse model for CD47, SIRPα and FcRs. In this model, Fc-engineered
humanized anti-CD47/SIRPα antibodies will be tested alone or in combination with other immunotherapies to
determine their effects on infiltrating immune cells. Elucidating the role of FcRs as modulators of response to
anti-CD47/SIRPα antibodies may establish a new avenue to maximize their therapeutic actions and provide
critical information on the role of innate immune cells in promoting effective antitumor responses."

The goal of this academic [Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) and MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC)] and industrial (EMPIRI) collaborative project is to validate a novel, functional cancer
diagnostic assay for clinical translation to improve and personalize the care of triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC) patients. The study will validate a novel 3D tumor tissue culture method (E-slices) invented by MPI
Kyuson Yun (HMRI) and licensed to EMPIRI, Inc., a biotech startup co-founded by Dr. Yun and Dave Gallup
(MPI). Together with Dr. Naoto Ueno (MPI, MDACC), a renowned physician-scientist specializing in TNBC
research and patient care, the team will validate the predictive accuracy of E-slices for individual TNBC patient
responses to recently approved chemoimmunotherapy for early TNBC patient care.
 The need for personalized medicine in oncology is widely accepted but translating this important concept
into clinical practice has been challenging. Currently, the dominant platform for precision medicine utilizes
genomics/sequencing-based assays to measure the expression and/or mutational profiles and then infer
responses to targeted therapies; however, this approach benefits <10% of patients with profiled tumors.
Recognizing the inherent limitations of these inference-based methods, functional assays (e.g., organoids, PDX
models) have been developed, but these approaches have numerous limitations including high cost and time
required to establish the models, low “take rates”, and destruction of the native tumor microenvironment (TME).
To overcome these challenges, EMPIRI developed a novel 3D ex vivo tumor culture method (E-slices)
that enables rapid, personalized drug sensitivity testing in intact patient tumor tissues. E-slices retain the
native TME and tissue architecture and are cultured in serum-free defined media, overcoming the limitations of
other approaches. In addition, E-slices can be generated from any solid tumor and used for testing responses to
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Importantly, E-slice accuracy has been validated in a
clinical setting for metastatic colorectal cancer to accurately predict individual patient treatment responses and
detect inter-patient differences to the same treatments in 4-12 days, paving the way for near evidence-based
personalized treatment selections. The team will: (i) determine whether E-slices predict patient responses to
SOC NAC: doxorubicin (Adriamycin) plus cyclophosphamide) in a retrospective study, (ii) measure
chemoimmunotherapy (Pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel + carboplatin) responses in humanized PDX slices from
known responders and non-responders; and (ii) evaluate the clinical utility of E-slices in predicting TNBC patient
responses to newly approved standard of care chemoimmunotherapy in a prospective study. Successful
completion of this project will provide the necessary data to apply E-slices as the first functional cancer diagnostic
test specifically designed to inform TNBC patient care."

Tightly-regulated protein synthesis rates are critical for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and function.
Mutations in ribosome proteins or genes that affect ribosome biogenesis cause “ribosomopathies”, a class of
bone marrow failure (BMF) syndromes. As prominently illustrated by Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS), a
BMF disease with progressive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) failure and predisposition to
myeloid malignancies, is driven by germline biallelic mutations in the assembly factors essential for the
maturation of the 60S ribosome subunit. However, how ribosome assembly is regulated in HSCs remains poorly
understood, as is its contribution to hematopoietic dysfunction. Importantly, other than allogeneic stem cell
transplantation, therapeutic interventions that mitigate the HSPC defects in BMF do not exist. This application is
based on our new studies that uncovered a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase, HectD1, in regulating HSC
function via ribosome biogenesis. Hectd1-deficient HSCs exhibit a striking defect in transplantation ability and
self-renewal, concomitant with a reduction in global protein synthesis. The mechanism underlying HSC
dysfunction upon Hectd1 deficiency is directly linked to aberrant ribosome assembly by ubiquitinating and
regulating the stability of ZNF622, a critical biogenesis factor for the maturation of the 60S large ribosomal
subunit in the cytoplasm. Depletion of HectD1 led to an accumulation of ZNF622 and the anti-association factor
eIF6 on the 60S subunit, decreased 80S monosome to 60S ratio, consistent with a subunit joining defect
associated with SDS-like diseases. Importantly, knockdown of ZNF622 in Hectd1-deficient cells restored protein
synthesis and HSC reconstitution capacity. This finding represents a rare in vivo example of genetic suppression
of HSC defects associated with dysfunctional ribosome biogenesis. The implications of this novel pathway to the
etiology of HSC failure and clinical treatment of “ribosomopathies”, mandates detailed mechanistic
understanding. Here, we propose comprehensive and in-depth analyses on the role of HectD1 and ZNF622 in
ribosome biogenesis and HSCs. In aim 1, we propose to investigate the roles of HectD1 and ZNF622 in HSCs
and how they interact to regulate HSC function, using a combination of complementary genetics, genomics, and
biochemical approaches. In aim 2, we will systematically analyze if HectD1/ZNF622 affects different aspects of
protein translation controls. Moreover, we will perform quantitative proteomics to assess if ribosome levels or
ribosome composition is affected by Hectd1/ZNF622 loss. In aim 3, we will interrogate potential dysregulation of
HECTD1 and ZNF622 in human BMF syndromes and explore therapeutic potential of targeting ZNF622 for the
treatment of BMF with dysfunctional ribosome biogenesis. Our study implicates a previously unappreciated role
of ubiquitination in regulating HSC function via controlling ribosome biogenesis factors, which are dysregulated
in ribosomopathies. Our findings will likely have significant impact on the therapeutic potential of modulating
ubiquitination and/or ribosome biogenesis factors in restoring HSC functions in BMF syndromes."

 Fungal infections are a significant public health problem because they can be lethal in
immunocompromised individuals. A major difficulty in treating these infections is the small number of effective
antifungal drugs. Existing treatments cause significant side effects and frequently result in the appearance of
resistant strains. The cell wall is an essential organelle of a fungal cell and contains many fungal-specific
components that are potential targets for anti-fungal drugs. For example, one major class of antifungal drugs
targets a key enzyme in cell wall assembly. Therefore, understanding how the cell wall is constructed is
essential for identifying new targets for antifungal drugs. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
haploid genomes produced by meiosis are encapsulated by a multi-layered spore wall, which allows spores to
resist a variety of environmental stresses. The inner layers of the spore wall are composed of mannan and β-
glucan, similar to the vegetative cell wall. The outer layers of the spore wall are comprised of the
polysaccharide chitosan, the polyphenol dityrosine and triglycerides. These outer spore wall components are
absent from vegetative cell walls and are primarily responsible for the stress resistance of spores. The
combination of (1) chitosan, (2) a polyphenol, and (3) neutral lipids is a conserved structural module in fungal
cell walls, including those of pathogenic fungi. The budding yeast spore wall therefore provides an excellent
model system to study the construction and regulation of this structural module. This grant is focused on how a
conserved set of lipid-droplet localized proteins regulates the assembly of this fungal cell wall structural module
both in S. cerevisiae and the pathogen Candida dubliniensis."
10910792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cryogenic electron microscopy can generate atomic resolution views of cells and is therefore a promising
technology to study the molecular mechanisms underlying key cellular processes in cells. However, cryo-EM
images cannot be interpreted directly to atomic resolution because cryo-EM imaging introduces radiation
damage to biological macromolecules. Current strategies to address radiation damage require combining
multiple copies to generate a single 3D reconstruction representing an average of the individual molecules. This
not suitable for cellular imaging because only a select few macromolecules are present in sufficiently high
numbers to generate an interpretable average. As a postdoc I contributed to the development of an alternate,
single molecule strategy to characterize the structure, interactions, and organization of macromolecular
complexes in cryo-EM images called 2D template matching (2DTM). Since 2DTM does not require averaging, it
has the potential to simultaneously visualize all cellular complexes individually, presenting a potentially
revolutionary new understanding of cellular function in health and disease. However, the potential of 2DTM is
currently limited by the difficulty to localize smaller complexes. With support from the NIH New Innovators
Program, I will pursue new strategies to extend 2DTM to detect and characterize smaller structures. New
technologies, particularly new imaging technologies, open new avenues of research because they allow us to
ask questions and see things that were never previously possible. Opening the cell to visualization at the
resolution of individual macromolecules will undoubtably reveal new, previously unanticipated biology."

The rapid adoption of mobile and interactive technologies by American families has outpaced research on their
potential effects on child development and health. Much prior research on television (TV) and older forms of
media relied upon parent recall of global constructs such as “screen time,” which may not be a complete
representation of family media use now that parents and children use mobile and interactive devices in an
intermittent, on-demand manner throughout the day. As highlighted at the 2018 NICHD scientific workshop on
Media Exposure and Early Child Development, the design affordances of mobile and interactive media differ
from TV in several important ways, and deserve novel scientific paradigms to describe how children and
families use media. The proposed project will fill these gaps in scientific knowledge by testing a conceptual
framework that examines how parent and child mobile media use influence the development of child socio-
emotional skills through mechanisms involving parent and child cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses
states. We will also test whether effects are moderated by child temperament, parent executive functioning,
and family psychosocial stress. The proposed research leverages an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of
diverse toddlers and their parents (NICHD 1R01HD102370, PI: Radesky) that conducts home visit-based data
collection at ages 2, 3, and 4 years, adding virtual data collection waves at 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 years with the
CAFE Consortium data collection toolkit. Our approach will be synergistic with the other CAFE investigators on
this P01 Proposal and include a program aim of efficiently classifying children’s content as positive and child-
centered vs. engagement-prolonging and exploitative. In specific aim 1, we will use structural equation models
to examine bidirectional, longitudinal associations between parent mobile media use duration, frequency of
interruptions of family activities, and media response states (cognitive load related to media use) with early
childhood social competence, emotion regulation, and problematic media use. In specific aim 2, we will
examine bidirectional longitudinal associations between child mobile media use for regulatory purposes,
content quality (exploitative vs. positive), and media response states (difficulty transitioning from media) with
early childhood social competence, emotion regulation, and problematic media use. In specific aim 3, Examine
differential susceptibility to media effects by testing moderation of associations in SA1 and SA2 by child
temperament, parent executive functioning, and psychosocial stressors. Our findings will contribute to the
evidence base upon which digital media guidelines are based, as well as digital design approaches that reflect
the needs of families with young children. In addition, our attention to modeling bidirectional associations and
articulating individual child, parent, and design affordance factors in the context of early socio-emotional
development will inform development of both precise behavioral interventions and recommendations for
population-level digital design and policy."
10913323,"Predictors of Problematic Media use in Middle Childhood: Project M.E.D.I.A
Abstract
 Media are a normative part of life for most children and adults with most individuals spending several
hours each day using various media devices. However, as many as 10% of adolescents and emerging adults
develop an addictive or pathological use of media, which impairs their ability to function in daily life. Existing
research on pathological media use has focused on adolescents and emerging adults; however, trajectories of
both pathological and healthy relationships with media likely begin well before adolescence. It is necessary to
study the trajectories of media use, and in particular problematic and healthy media use, earlier in child
development. This will allow researchers to discover the precursors of problematic use before pathological use
of media has developed. The long-term goal is to understand media-related problematic behavior in childhood
and its contribution to the development of pathological media use later in life. Problematic media use in early
childhood involves a host of likely precursors to later pathological media use, including a fixation on media,
tantrums or crying when media is removed, and sneaking or lying about media. The objective of this particular
application involves three specific aims (1) to determine how early parenting (technoference and parent-child
relationship quality) is associated with problematic media use during middle childhood, (2) to examine how child
media content (child-directed and exploitative) is related to problematic media use over time, and (3) determine
the transactional nature of problematic media use and child behavioral outcomes (social competence and
executive functioning) in early childhood. The central hypothesis is that early parenting (technoference and
parent/child relationship) and low-quality media will be associated with child problematic media use during middle
childhood and such behavior will be associated with negative child outcomes. We propose to explore these aims
in a 3-year longitudinal study in early childhood (from ages 5.5 to 7.5 years), utilizing our cohort of 500 children
we have been studying since birth. We will do this by using several innovative methods including the CAFE
toolkit (passive sensing apps that track time spent using media, time use diaries), and EMA to capture
problematic media use in the moment. The proposed research is significant, because this longitudinal project
will examine how early parenting and child media content relate to problematic media across the middle
childhood period. This knowledge will help researchers identify high-risk individuals that might benefit from early
intervention aimed at changing the trajectory of media exposure, to balance media with other activities, and to
increase healthy media use. This may reduce the number of individuals who develop a pathological relationship
with media later in development."

10913360,"LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEM CORE SUMMARY
The Pediatric Center of Excellence in Nephrology (PCEN) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is
designed to accelerate evidence generation in childhood kidney diseases through infrastructure that helps
overcome the many challenges to conducting rapid and efficient clinical research studies. PEDSnet, a growing
multi-specialty network of nine of the nation's largest pediatric academic health systems, has harmonized their
diverse electronic health record (EHR) systems to develop a national architecture to rapidly implement learning
health systems (LHS) across all pediatric health conditions. The LHS Core of the PCEN has partnered with
PEDSnet to establish a national interconnected, multi-institutional infrastructure able to reach large numbers of
children with kidney disease and to provide the depth of information necessary to comprehensively characterize
their clinical course and outcomes and to evaluate therapies. The LHS Core takes advantage of the expertise
and infrastructure developed during the construction of PEDSnet to provide methodologic, informatics, and study
development support to Center investigators and to expand the broad PEDSnet database to meet the needs of
PCEN-sponsored studies. The embedded Pediatric Nephrology Data Resource achieves both scale and
efficiency for EHR data currently being collected on over 8 million children with an emphasis on data elements
and data quality optimization central to studies of pediatric kidney disease.
In order to accelerate evidence generation and advance evaluations of interventions in pediatric nephrology, the
LHS Core will: expand and facilitate access to pediatric- and kidney-specific structured data in the Pediatric
Nephrology Data Resource and produce annual clinical insight reports for childhood kidney disorders; stimulate
and support high quality observational studies using the Pediatric Nephrology Data Resource by providing
technical and methodological resources to investigators; and expand Core services to enhance infrastructure for
comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials in pediatric nephrology and leverage this
infrastructure to decrease time to trial implementation. In addition to providing access to this unique data
resource, LHS Core services will include computable phenotyping, augmented structured data and variable
definitions relevant to pediatric kidney disease, an active chart review program, patient-reported outcomes and
survey administration, data science and methodological consultation, self-service query tools, privacy preserving
linkage to other data resources, connection to pediatric nephrology and urology LHS initiatives, rapid
administrative start-up, prep-to-trial services, a multi-institutional kidney biopsy registry, real-world data for
external control matching, and EHR-facilitated recruitment. The Core team comprises expertise in data science,
epidemiology, health services research, and patient-centered outcomes. The Core has forged an organizational
and leadership architecture, created a uniquely valuable data resource, and developed an infrastructure that
makes cross-institutional collaboration amongst investigators in pediatric nephrology research routine."
10913362,"MOLECULAR PRECISION NEPHROLOGY CORE SUMMARY
The goal of the Molecular Precision Nephrology (MPN) Core of the PCEN is to facilitate
identification of novel targets and expand therapeutic options for children with kidney disease.
The currently available clinical, biochemical and histological descriptors for kidney disease are
insufficient, as they poorly predict prognosis and therapeutic response. A revolution in precision
molecular measurements is underway. Novel precision diagnostic methods can accurately
monitor genome-wide gene expression, regulation, function, cellular history and cellular
interactions in kidney biopsy samples and can highlight targetable changes. Novel precision
diagnostic methods are critical in pediatrics due to the paucity of defined therapeutic targets,
heterogeneity of causes of kidney diseases, and barriers to conducting large clinical trials.
There are several critical barriers to the clinical and research implementation of molecular
precision tools in pediatric nephrology: 1, the lack of available reference (normal healthy) tissue
samples 2, absence of a high quality uniformly processing core for pediatric kidney samples 3,
non-linearity of currently used single cell analytical methods, generating non-transferrable
information between datasets and necessitating single large atlasing efforts 4, shortage of
dedicated bioinformatics effort for the generation of a pediatric kidney atlas. The MPN Core will
address these barriers and will usher in a new phase of pediatric kidney disease research.
Specifically, the MPN Core will:
Create the CHOP-KID resource: the CHOP kidney tissue bank, containing fresh, frozen, fixed
embedded tissue samples from healthy and diseased pediatric kidney samples from an ethnically
diverse population and an associated de-identified database containing demographic, clinical and
histological annotation.
Generate reference single cell expression, epigenome, spatial expression and proteome maps
for kidney development and maturation and serve as a core to process and compare disease
tissue samples for the PCEN research base.
Deliver a harmonized integrated multi-modal pediatric kidney cell atlas and foster its use in the
engaged community. This will be accomplished using new computational tools for identification
of disease-causing genes, cell types and mechanisms, focusing on cell type annotation,
reconstruction of cell lineages and cell-cell communications, and integration of spatial multi-omics
single cell information, clinical, demographic, and genetic data."
10913364,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pragmatic trials and comparative effectiveness research often require causal inference methods to establish
cause-effect relationships between interventions and outcomes. With treatments that can change over time, it
is crucial to account for time-dependent confounders to accurately estimate treatment effects. Statistical
methods to do so have not been developed for recurrent time-to-event outcomes, although such outcomes are
often observed in children with chronic kidney disease. This project aims to fill this gap by developing a novel
class of statistical methods to estimate the effects of time-varying treatments on recurrent event outcomes. A
marginal structural model approach will be applied to the proportional rates model, conditional gap time model,
and conditional frailty model to estimate both recurrent event rates and risks of subsequent outcomes after the
first outcome event. This project will develop theoretical properties of each model and test its performance
using Monte Carlo simulation studies. The new models will then be applied to real data from observational
cohort studies and electronic health record databases to answer important clinical questions for children with
kidney diseases for the first time. Specifically, this project will enable estimation of the effect of time-varying
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor dose on the rate of proteinuria remissions among children
enrolled in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study; the effect of time-varying corticosteroid use
on time from one infection-related acute care event to the next event among patients with glomerular disease
in the Cure Glomerulonephropathy (CureGN) study; and the effect of time-varying calcium-based and non-
calcium-based phosphate binder use on the time from one skeletal fracture to the next fracture among a
heterogeneous population of children with chronic kidney disease in PEDSnet. User-friendly statistical software
and associated documentation for implementation of the models will be developed to facilitate their use in a
wide range of applications. The tools established by this project will open many new avenues of study for
analyzing longitudinal data from observational studies, electronic health record databases, and pragmatic
trials. The accurate and precise estimation of time-varying treatment effects on recurrent outcomes will inform
improvements in clinical care for children with kidney diseases."
10913422,"The cornea is the most densely innervated tissue in the body, and pain is the primary experience resulting from
corneal stimulation. While physiological corneal pain (nociceptive pain) protects the eye from injury,
inflammation and/or nerve damage can result in prolonged or chronic corneal pain. Corneal afferents represent
a diverse population of neurons, with specialized properties related to maintaining ocular health. The full
diversity of these neurons, and their responses to injury are unknown. The first set of experiments will
determine the mRNA transcript signatures of mouse corneal neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and their
transcriptional responses to corneal injury and compare with cell-type-specific transcriptional and epigenomic
signatures of human TG neurons. Corneal afferents are known to project to two main regions in the spinal
trigeminal nucleus (Vsp), each with distinct roles in nociception and maintaining corneal homeostasis. We have
preliminary data demonstrating an additional projection to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a region
critical in regulating complex motivational-affective responses to aversive stimuli. Its contribution to corneal
pain is unknown. The second set of experiments will examine central processing of corneal input in the lPBN.
We will determine the contribution of corneal->lPBN primary afferent projections to corneal nociceptive
responses and the function of lPBN neurons in corneal nociceptive and chronic pain behaviors. Additional
studies will perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis to identify molecular profiles of corneal-activated
brainstem neurons, followed by multiplex in situ hybridization to provide spatial resolution in regions that
receive direct corneal afferent input. The cornea is also endowed with resident corneal leukocytes (RCLs)
residing in close proximity to corneal nerves, suggesting the possibility of neuro-immune crosstalk in the
cornea. However, current knowledge is limited on possible direct regulation of RCLs through corneal nerves, or
the influence of RCLs on corneal nerve function. The third set of experiments will characterize the cell
populations and molecular mechanisms involved in neuroimmune crosstalk resulting in peripheral nerve
sensitization in the cornea. Corneal single cell mRNA transcript signatures associated in murine corneal pain
models will be used to identify transcriptional changes that underly nociceptor sensitization. Crossing these
immune cell transcripts with transcript profiles of corneal afferents will provide evidence for ligand-receptor
pairs. In vitro studies will confirm the ability of the identified modulators to sensitize TG neurons, and the
functional significance will be assessed using behavior and ex vivo electrophysiology. Employing a
multidisciplinary approach, these experiments will provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular and molecular
mechanisms of nociceptive and chronic corneal pain, leading to the identification novel pathways and
treatments."
10913424,"SUMMARY
Corneal wound healing is a complex process involving corneal epithelial cell proliferation, myofibroblast
generation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In corneal wound models, the disruption of the
Bowman's layer that separates the epithelium from stroma is often observed, and this disruption may lead to a
different pathological (fibrotic) state, which we propose can be mediated by the intercellular signaling between
epithelial and stromal cells in part via paracrine factors. TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that exists in three
isoforms (TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3), which exert biological effects through signaling pathways to maintain corneal
integrity and wound healing. Previously, we found that TGF-β1 is involved in corneal fibrotic wound healing by
stimulating myofibroblast differentiation; whereas, TGF-β3 application after corneal wounding reversed and
diminished the fibrotic response in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Despite the functional differences in TGF-β
isoforms, the molecular mechanisms in dampening fibrosis remain poorly understood.
 Amid other paracrine factors, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are recognized as mediators for cell-cell
communication. EVs can selectively engulf a part of their parental cell and become enriched in a repertoire of
bioactive cargo (e.g., proteins or lipids), and offset their cargo into recipient cells by ensuing physiological
changes. We have shown that corneal epithelial cell-derived EVs can trigger myofibroblast differentiation and
generate an ECM microenvironment that promotes myofibroblast persistence, which is key for corneal scarring;
however, the bioactive cargo driving this remains unclear. Of disease relevance, keratoconus (KCN) is of
interest because it leads to corneal stromal scarring even without any acute trauma or known underlying
etiology. Pathologically, KCN is similar to our wound-healing models in that the KCN corneas: 1) develop gaps
in Bowman's layer that allow direct contact between epithelium and stroma; 2) have EVs present between
epithelial cells and stroma; and 3) develop myofibroblast differentiation that leads to scarring under the breaks
in Bowman's layer. TGF-β's role in myofibroblast differentiation and ECM remodeling suggests involvement in
KCN's pathogenesis, either in a causative or secondary repair role, leading to structural changes in KCN.
 In this proposal, we hypothesize that loading TGF-β3 onto EVs and applying to corneal wounds will drive
healing without scarring by dampening the fibrotic response and preventing the onset of scar formation;
however, TGF-β1-EVs will enhance the scarring in corneal wounds. Through these experiments we will also
determine bioactive cargo from KCN-epithelial cell derived EVs that is contributing to KCN corneal scarring and
disease progression. Relevance to Public Health—Collectively, this proposal will provide key mechanistic
insights into corneal EV biology and their corresponding cargo, as well as identify the bioactive EV cargo that
could be used to predict corneal scarring in KCN patients in the future."
10913427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic/Latinx women are disproportionately diagnosed with breast
tumor exhibiting more aggressive phenotypes; and NHB women are dying from breast cancer at rates
higher than every other racial/ethnic group in the United States (US). Due to structural racism (and its
downstream effects), NHB and Hispanic/Latinx women experience more chronic stressors compared
to non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. Emerging data, from our group and others, show that social and
biologic factors contribute to the development of breast cancers with more aggressive tumor features
that lead to the poorer outcomes. Evidence supports allostatic load – a measure of dysregulation across
major physiologic systems including metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune/inflammatory systems –
as a measure of cumulative physiologic stress and risk factor for adverse health outcomes. Data from
a nationally representative sample of US women showed that allostatic load is inversely associated
with socioeconomic status (SES) and positively associated with breast cancer among Black women,
but not White women. No prior study has prospectively explored the impact of allostatic load and
neighborhood contextual factors (simultaneously) on breast cancer in a large, diverse study sample.
Here we propose to examine the impact of pre-diagnostic allostatic load score (ALS) and objectively
measured neighborhood contextual factors on breast cancer incidence and phenotype in a large,
nested case-control study of NHB, NHW, and Hispanic/Latinx participants in the Women’s Health
Initiative (WHI). Our central hypothesis is that risk of breast cancer and aggressive tumors are
attributable to the impact of higher ALS and socioeconomically deprived and racially segregated
neighborhood context. Further, we hypothesize that allostatic load mediates the associations of
neighborhood context with breast cancer, which differ by race/ethnicity. Leveraging WHI’s prospective
design, rich epidemiologic and clinical data, and long-term follow-up, to test these hypotheses through
the following aims: 1) Investigate associations of allostatic load with breast cancer risk and tumor
phenotype; 2) Investigate associations of neighborhood contextual factors with breast cancer risk and
tumor phenotype; and 3) Evaluate whether independent associations of allostatic load and
neighborhood context with breast cancer differ by race/ethnicity. This study will have a high impact by
yielding novel, prospective data on the impact of unfavorable neighborhood contextual factors and
allostatic load (as an intermediate biological process/mechanism between neighborhood context and
health) on breast cancer. Findings from this study will contribute new knowledge about the biological
basis of long-term effects of structural racism and utility of ALS as a biomarker of cancer risk. These
data are essential to developing evidence-based prevention strategies to improve cancer health equity."
10913540,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While newborn screening (NBS) programs have prevented death and disability for scores of children with
inherited disorders over the past 50 years, these programs face significant emerging challenges. Specifically,
the NBS system has ushered in an era in which increasing numbers of parents are leaving the NBS
experience uncertain about their child's future health. This erosion of prognostic certainty stems from the
addition of disorders to NBS panels that have broad phenotypic variability. As a result, a new group of
children called “patients in waiting” are literally waiting to see when – or if – they develop signs and
symptoms of disease. While society mandates that these children be screened, we have little understanding
of the benefits and harms of these uncertain prognoses. Previous studies have provided vital foundational
work on the potential harms and benefits for “patients in waiting;” however, little quantitative and no
longitudinal population-based data exist to inform our care for these children. This gap has significant ethical
and policy implications. From an ethical perspective, it leaves us unsure of the balance of benefits and
harms for children who undergo a mandatory public health program days after birth. From a policy
perspective, it leads to the addition of disorders to mandatory state NBS panel based on incomplete data.
The proposed project’s overall objective is to close this gap by examining the scope and magnitude of
benefits and harms on parents and their children who receive an uncertain prognosis after NBS. We will
accomplish the project objective through a longitudinal multistate cohort study of parents of “patients in
waiting,” with the following aims: 1) To determine the longitudinal scope and magnitude of benefits and
harms on parents and their children who have received an uncertain prognosis after NBS; 2) To elucidate
the longitudinal experiences of parents and their children who have received an uncertain prognosis after
NBS; 3) To develop recommendations for NBS programs that will inform policies and practices to maximize
benefit and minimize harm to children who receive an uncertain prognosis after NBS. In summary, this
project will provide the most comprehensive assessment to date of the benefits and harms of an uncertain
prognosis after NBS and ensure that children and their parents continue to receive a net benefit from this
successful public health program."

The goal of this K08 award is for Dr. Kearns, a dentist scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, to
gain support and training to become an independent investigator focused on translational research that
encourages the use of evidence-based public health interventions to promote oral and overall health. Excess
added sugars consumption leads to increased risk for cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and
dental caries. While various evidence-based policies and programs have been developed to reduce sugar
consumption in multiple-settings, to date, these strategies have not been widely adopted. The dental
profession, comprised of numerous stakeholders (e.g., dental organizations, dental leaders, dentists), has the
potential to help close this evidence to policy gap. Similar to efforts to support community water fluoridation,
the dental profession can encourage innovative solutions to dental caries by engaging in sugar reduction policy
dissemination (SRPD) behaviors (e.g., preparing issue briefs, publishing consensus statements, conducting
policy research and surveillance, engaging with state coalitions, doing media outreach, and delivering office-
based communication, among others.) However, dentist stakeholder involvement in sugar reduction policy and
program dissemination is low. The overarching objective of this K08 proposal is to facilitate implementing an
evidence-based intervention designed to increase dentist stakeholder engagement in SRPD. This K08 project
aims to identify barriers and facilitators to dentist stakeholders' involvement in SRPD and to develop and pilot
test an intervention that will increase dentists' SRPD behaviors. A carefully devised training plan will allow the
candidate to gain expertise in dissemination and implementation (D&I) science, in-depth interviews and focus
groups, quantitative methods and survey statistics, policy-relevant experimental methods to foster provider
behavior change, and in grantwriting. Training goals will be achieved through rigorous mentorship from
experts, graduate-level coursework, and advanced professional development activities. The proposed research
project is congruent with training goals. Aim 1 includes an analysis of sugar industry public relations campaigns
to identify the techniques used to influence dentist stakeholders' SRPD behaviors. Aim 2-Study A includes in-
depth interviews with dentist leaders to identify facilitators and barriers to SRPD behaviors and to help identify
questionnaire items for Aim 2-Study B, a large, nationally representative-survey of US licensed dentists to
determine the relationship between drivers of SRPD behaviors and actual SRPD behaviors. Aim 3 involves
developing and pilot testing an intervention strategy to change dentist stakeholders SRPD behaviors. The
long-term objective of this research is to speed the translation of the US Dietary Guidelines added sugar
recommendation into policy and practice. This award will complement the candidate's existing strengths by
providing training in new domains and will prepare her for an independent research career in D&I science to
improve oral health."
10913313,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The discovery that individuals with Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome (DS) have neuropathological
features identical to those with sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) played a critical role in the
identification of the amyloid precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 supporting the amyloid
cascade hypothesis. People with DS have a lifetime risk for dementia in excess of 75% and
comprise the world's largest population of genetically-determined AD. Just as studying DS
helped identify the role of amyloid precursor protein mutations in AD pathogenesis, it is also
likely to inform us of the potential benefit of manipulating the amyloid pathway on treatment
outcomes in AD. It is critically important to the DS population and to the AD therapeutics field to
conduct clinical trials, particularly those targeting amyloid accumulation, in individuals with DS.
With this application, we propose to utilize the existing depth and breadth of expertise of the
NIA-funded Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC) to conduct AD clinical trials in adults
with DS across performance sites with expertise in DS including the Alzheimer's Biomarker
Consortium for Down Syndrome (ABC-DS). As part of an NIH award received last year, we
established the ACTC-DS network which includes working groups comprised of leaders from
ACTC, ABC-DS and the European Horizon21 DS network to develop the collaborations,
infrastructure and plans required to conduct AD clinical trials in DS.
During the proposed R61 `Trial Readiness Phase' of the present project, in Aim 1, we will enroll
120 adults with DS (ages 35-55) across 15 sites into a trial ready cohort (TRC) to collect
outcome measures and biomarkers harmonized with those being collected in the ongoing ABC-
DS study (n = ~400). In Aim 2, we will determine the relationships between cognitive measures
and AD biomarkers to identify endpoints for clinical trials that best reflect disease progression.
During the R33 `Clinical Trial' phase, for Aim 3, we propose to implement a phase II
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a
promising anti-amyloid therapeutic among individuals the TRC. In Aim 4, we will determine the
impact of this agent on biomarker evidence of disease modification.
Fundamentally, this project will serve to bring AD therapies to the DS population by leveraging
the infrastructure of ACTC and incorporating the experience and expertise of the ABC-DS and
Horizon21 networks. Beyond the proposed trial, this will establish the means and methods to
conduct future therapeutic trials in this population. The potential impact of this approach on
improving the lives of adults with DS as well as the general population cannot be overstated."
10913440,"Ethyl alcohol (henceforth ethanol) is a human carcinogen.1,2 Its consumption has been associated with cancers
at various sites, including the oral cavity. Despite strong epidemiological evidence, the mechanisms of ethanol
carcinogenicity remain unclear, hampering the ability to develop efficacious preventive strategies, identify
individual susceptibility, and effectively face the challenges deriving from the projected increase in consumption.
Ethanol major metabolite, acetaldehyde (AA), is suggested to play a crucial role in head and neck cancers by
reacting with DNA. These reactions generate chemical modifications (DNA adducts) that, if not repaired, may
result in mutations and ultimately lead to cancer. Individuals with genetic deficiencies in ALDH2, the enzyme
responsible for AA detoxification, were shown to have a 15% increased risk of developing oral cancer when
drinking.5 Additionally, Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients, who have impaired mechanisms to repair AA-related DNA
damage, have an average 500-fold higher chance of developing oral cancer.6 Previous studies have shown a
direct and dose-dependent connection between ethanol consumed and AA-derived DNA damage, in the oral
cavity of healthy volunteers.7 This effect was not as evident in blood DNA from the same individuals, indicating
a distinct contribution of AA exposure coming from oral ethanol metabolism by the mucosa and oral microbiome.
Our hypothesis is that AA resulting from oral metabolism of ethanol is playing a crucial role in oral cancer
through the formation of DNA adducts, and that levels and persistence of driver adducts will increase in
individuals with increasing oral cancer risk. Using cutting-edge analytical approaches, our objective is to
characterize ethanol's oral metabolism and its corresponding DNA damage and mutational profiles, to develop
a systematic assembly of biomarkers for identifying oral cancer risk and for developing strategies for early
detection and prevention. This will be done by completing 3 aims. The first one will characterize DNA damage
profiles in oral cells, collected after exposure to a controlled alcohol dose from participants from 3 groups at
increasing risk of AA-related oral cancer (active ALDH2*1/1* homozygotes, inactive ALDH2*1/2* heterozygotes
and FA patients). Driver adducts will be identified as those increasing in the groups following the increased
cancer risk and persisting over time in FA patients. The second aim will focus on investigating the role of the oral
microbiome in ethanol metabolism, by characterizing the oral microflora and measuring the aldehyde profile
resulting from the ethanol dose in the saliva of study participants. Additionally, the oral microbiome will be
characterized in samples from non-drinkers, included to investigate if ethanol consumption results in a specific
profile. Finally, the third aim will analyze genome-scale mutational signatures in oral cell lines exposed to AA, for
which DNA adducts will be profiled, and in oral tumor tissues from rats chronically exposed to AA or ethanol.
This will yield mechanistic evidence on ethanol-related oral mutagenesis and cancer formation and identify DNA
adducts bearing mutagenic potential."

 Quantitation and Spatial Registration of Airways Dysfunction with Dynamic 19F MRI in Cystic Fibrosis
Rationale: Currently available endpoints for testing of new therapies in CF typically are either insensitive to focal
changes in lung disease and early lung disease (e.g. spirometry), or require ionizing radiation (e.g. chest CT).
These problems limit their utility, and typically prevent repetitive use, particularly in young children. The addition
of an inhaled gas as a contrast agent to quantify ventilation while preserving spatial inforrmation using MRI
techniques is an important advance in pulmonary imaging, but is not yet widely available. We propose to develop
the use of a perfluorinated gas for MRI imaging, which may have several important advantages over other
techniques, including being readily transferrable to other research centers. Methods: Subjects with cystic fibrosis
will undergo perfluoropropane (PFP)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI), in addition to 1H
ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI. In a longitudinal study, we will evaluate the short-term variability and
responsiveness of 19F MRI to disease state changes while exploring the relationship between functional changes
in ventilation and lung structure. Parallel measurement of traditional outcome measures (spirometry, lung
clearance index, and patient symptoms) will help evaluate whether additional sensitivity and value is added by
this technique. Subjects will be tested in relation to pulmonary exacerbations as well to determine measure
performance over different physiologic states. 19F MRI will be extended down to the pediatric age range to
determine the feasibility of performing these studies in young children, and the ability to detect disease in children
with normal spirometry. Training: Dr. Goralski will embark upon specialized training in clinical research topics
(advanced study design and biostatistics), as well as training in medical imaging analysis to further her goal in
becoming an independent investigator. She will also seek both formal and informal education in advance study
design and biostatistical methods. Expected Results: We expect that 19F MRI will readily detect abnormalities
in small airway function in subjects with CF lung disease, that measurements will be valid over short time frames,
and that they will reflect acute changes in disease activity (i.e. exacerbations). We further expect that 19F MRI
will be feasible in young children and will be able to detect ventilation inhomogeneity, even in young CF subjects
with normal lung function tested by conventional means (i.e. spirometry)."

This core will coordinate the efforts of all the investigators and collaborators involved in this Program; organize
and conduct meetings of P01 participants and annual meetings of Program Project participants; prepare the
necessary documents related to Program Project activities, including reports of Program Project investigator
meetings, and prepare progress reports for official agencies; facilitate interaction between individual Projects
and between Projects and Cores and monitor the progress of the individual Projects on a regular basis; maintain
appropriate fiscal oversight of the Projects and Cores and prepare necessary fiscal reports of official agencies;
and assure compliance with appropriate regulations regarding experimentation with human subjects and

10914077,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Low back pain (LBP) is traditionally viewed as either a transient condition with acute episodes or a chronic
persisting condition. However, it is increasingly recognized that for most (>80% of cases), LBP has a variable
and ongoing trajectory characterized by fluctuating symptoms – with periods of worse symptoms referred to as
“flares”. Current work regarding risk factors for LBP only considers those associated with a new episode or the
transition to chronic LBP. Findings from that work has failed to deliver effective strategies to prevent new
episodes or chronicity, nor reduce the excessive burden of LBP. The underlying premise of this proposal is that
fluctuation or flaring of LBP is mediated by transient/fluctuating exposure to a range of factors across multiple
domains, that differ between individuals, and identification of these factors could provide a basis for a completely
new model to personalize care. This project will take a fresh look at LBP by directly addressing this question
using innovative methods that are enabled by recent advances in technology. The work is based on our extensive
collaboration with people with LBP that has provided critical insight into how flares are defined (which surprisingly
is not based on pain alone) and their perspective of the potential causes for LBP flares.
Our multidisciplinary research team propose an innovative case-crossover study that will address two aims. AIM
1 will examine, at multiple timepoints over a period of 3 months, an array of candidate biological/behavioral,
psychological, social, and environmental risk factors for LBP flare that have been selected based on consumer
perspective, literature review and our extensive preliminary studies. Measures will be made in the “real word”
using advanced wearable and online technologies. AIM 2 will involve an embedded study of individuals from the
main participant cohort who flare frequently. For 7 days, eligible individuals will undergo more intensive “real-
world” physiological and biomechanical measures using an innovative combination of wearable sensors and
home-based sample/data collection to investigate potential mechanisms underlying two surprising preliminary
observations: (1) that poor sleep is a potent risk factor for a subsequent flare (as opposed to the traditional view
that pain interferes with and causes poor sleep), and (2) that low rather than high physical activity is a risk factor
for LBP flare. We aims to identify not only if, but how, daily variations in sleep quality and physical activity – two
of the most important, yet modifiable health behaviors – drive flare of LBP.
Together these data will fill a major gap by providing new understanding of mechanisms that drive the fluctuating
experience of LBP. Such factors will provide the foundation to develop and test more targeted and personalized
interventions to reduce the enormous – and worsening – burden of this condition on sufferers and society."

Despite the tremendous advances in genetic testing for inherited cancer, the promise of
this technology cannot be realized through testing alone. Rather, it is critical to access
appropriate follow-up care that may include cancer risk management (CRM) options for
individuals and their at-risk family members. Current gaps in implementation of
guideline-adherent follow-up care based on inherited cancer genetic test results include
both over and under treatment among those with pathogenic and likely pathogenic
(P/LP) variants or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). Furthermore, we are missing
the opportunity to magnify the uptake and impact of testing among family members who
are at high risk due to suboptimal family communication (FC) of genetic test results and
cancer family history. Our highly innovative and practice-changing study is designed to
shift the paradigm by which individuals with P/LP variants and VUS in inherited cancer
genes are provided with information to enhance guideline-adherent CRM and FC of test
results. Through our proposed type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized
control mixed methods study, we will test two interventions with a diverse group of 600
individuals with a P/LP variant or a VUS result in a variety of inherited cancer genes for
which CRM guidelines are available. Intervention A is focused on increasing guideline-
adherent CRM (LivingLabReport), and Intervention B is focused on increasing FC and
subsequent family testing (GeneSHARE). Alongside developing, refining, and testing
interventions to improve guideline-adherent CRM and FC, we will study the
implementation of these interventions across racially, geographically, and socio-
economically diverse populations and settings. The information gathered through testing
effectiveness and implementation of the interventions will be used to develop, modify
and pilot test adaptive stepped interventions with the potential to efficiently maximize
effectiveness in improving guideline-adherent CRM and FC. This transdisciplinary effort,
enriched for accrual of Blacks, rural dwellers, and other underserved populations, will
inform policy and the development of scalable models for delivering evidence-based
care. Ultimately, our study will help address the need for access to effective information
to guide CRM and enhance FC in diverse populations across various genes and settings
which is greatly needed if the population at large is to benefit from genomic advances in
this era of personalized medicine."

Purpose: The Rhythm Evaluation for AntiCoagulaTion with Continuous Monitoring of Atrial Fibrillation (REACT
AF) clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of two treatment strategies for stroke prevention in atrial
fibrillation (AF): the current standard of continuous direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC) versus a novel strategy of
precision, time-delimited DOAC initiated only in response to a ≥ 1-hour AF episode detected by an AF-sensing
smartwatch (AFSW (Apple Watch)).
Rationale: Stroke risk is often temporally related to AF onset and duration, but bleeding risk continues as a
constant risk of anticoagulation exposure even during long AF-free periods when stroke risk may be low. REACT-
AF will evaluate the benefits and risks of withholding anticoagulation during prolonged periods of sinus rhythm
as guided by an AFSW. Compared with continuous DOAC, AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC treatment may
reduce bleeding events while maintaining stroke protection. This has potential to improve important major clinical
outcomes and quality of life while reducing health care utilization.
Design: REACT-AF is a multicenter prospective, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint (PROBE design) trial
comparing the current standard of care of continuous DOAC administration versus time-delimited DOAC
treatment guided by an AFSW in patients with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF and low-to-moderate
stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 1-4). The study will have an initial explanatory phase I followed by an
explanatory phase II with pragmatic elements.
Primary Aim 1 (Efficacy Objective): To assess whether AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC therapy is non-
inferior to continuous DOAC therapy for a composite endpoint that includes: (1) Ischemic Stroke; (2) Systemic
embolism; (3) All-cause mortality.
Hypothesis: Time-delimited DOAC therapy is non-inferior to continuous DOAC therapy for the composite
endpoint of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, and all-cause mortality.
Primary Aim 2 (Safety Objective): To assess whether AFSW-guided, time-delimited DOAC therapy significantly
reduces major bleeding events compared to continuous DOAC therapy.
Hypothesis: Major bleeding events will be significantly lower in participants randomized to AFSW-guided, time-
delimited DOAC therapy compared with participants receiving continuous DOAC therapy.
Exploratory Aim 1: To compare overall participant satisfaction with anticoagulation management between the
two study arms.
Exploratory Aim 2: To compare estimates of health-related resource utilization in participants randomized to
control versus experimental arms."

Continuum Educational Technologies’ (Continuum) will work with the University of Kansas (KU) on the
proposed I-RED program entitled Smart Tools to Accelerate Research Translation by Uplifting Participants for
the Central IDeA State Region (STARTUP Central) program to stimulate technological innovation in the IDeA
state regions by addressing the entrepreneurial educational needs of investigators in translating scientific
discoveries from research laboratories into commercial products that improve human health and promote
economic growth. Through the proposed effort, STARTUP Central will help the Central Region address a
persistent gap between its robust biomedical research activities and the development of a comparable pipeline
of academic entrepreneurs commercializing the many innovations resulting from this research.
Continuum’s proposed suite of educational products will provide a comprehensive, uniform, and assessable
mechanism for developing robust cultures of entrepreneurship within individual regional institutions, and will
provide a centralized mechanism for individual institutions to coordinate efforts, share resources, and develop
regional best-practices. These “smart” tools will seek to organize and systemize the abundance of information
and basic educational resources available regarding biomedical translation, employing educational psychology
principles for adult online learning to develop an integrated and effective curriculum from an otherwise
disparate and disconnected collection of resources and programming. Back-end analytics, user-feedback, and
evaluation features will be heavily embedded into the learning management system to provide users,
institutions, and Continuum with a means to continuously assess and improve the usability and effectiveness of
the educational tools and their content, as well as to assess and maximize the impact of the products on
individual users and the broader entrepreneurial culture of each institutional customer.
In Phase 1, Continuum and KU will work collaboratively to assemble the project consortium and make all
preparations to run the Phase 2 Pilot Project program. The team will work together to input content for and
design a wireframe model of the educational products. These wireframe products will then be initially tested,
iteratively redesigned, and initially validated. At the end of Phase 1, the validated wireframe educational
product will be ready for full enhancement and used in the two Pilot Project programs in Phase 2. Assessment
of the enhanced smart educational products to meet user needs in the two Pilot Project programs will be used
to iteratively redesign the educational products. At the end of Phase 2, the smart educational products and the
format of the Pilot Project program will be ready for commercialization.
Outcomes will be assessed based on enhanced entrepreneurship attitudes, confidence, and competency in the
program participants compared to the control. Metrics to evaluate program outcomes include number of
products developed, number of licensing agreements signed, number of students and faculty being trained
through the various aspects of STARTUP Central, number of patents filed, number of SBIR/STTR applications
submitted and awarded by any federal agency, and number of start-up companies launched."

Herbal dietary supplements and medicines are used as the primary form of health care for about eighty percent
of the world’s population. In the United States, the use of these botanicals is increasing, accounting for $11.26
billion in sales in the past year alone. Despite widespread and increasing use, herbal dietary supplements and
medicines are severely underregulated compared to western medicine. Exact mechanisms, active compounds
and metabolites, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles are not fully understood. This study focuses on the top-
selling herbal dietary supplement in the year 2020 in the United States, elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.), which
exhibits antiviral effects. Many natural products can exhibit poor bioavailability and thus despite the promise of
antiviral efficacy in vitro, do not equate to relevant pharmacological effects in vivo. Metabolic degradation
products resulting from host metabolism or gut microbiome metabolism can, however, exhibit increased
bioavailability and pharmacological effects. Few studies have examined the metabolic products, bioavailability,
and pharmacological effects of metabolites of elderberry, and none have done so when regarding its antiviral
activities. Thus, this proposal provides novel research training in pharmacokinetics and pharmacognosy to test
metabolic biotransformation products of elderberry extracts for antiviral efficacy. This proposal will develop the
methods and capabilities for host and gut microbial metabolism of complex botanical mixtures and provide
pharmacological significance regarding the antiviral efficacy of elderberry. Metabolic products of elderberry will
be characterized in vitro models and validated in vivo. Isolation of metabolites generated will be conducted using
preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and their antiviral activity assessed against influenza
models. Antiviral compounds and metabolites will be characterized using high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray crystallography where applicable. Bioavailability and
contributions of the gut microbiome will be assessed using a gnotobiotic murine model. These studies will identify
metabolites from elderberry exhibiting both antiviral capacities and bioavailability and help establish an
infrastructure for metabolic assessment of other botanicals. This will advance the understanding and

HIV-related brain disorders (NeuroAIDS), including mental health, neurocognitive, and neurological problems,
remain common globally. Over the past 10 years, the Multidisciplinary NeuroAIDS Research and Training
Program to Improve HIV Outcomes has developed new NeuroAIDS research capacity at the University of
Ibadan, Nigeria (UI) in three interacting cores: the Mental Health Core, Translational and Clinical Sciences
Core, and the Neuropsychological Infrastructure Core. Our overarching goal in the next 5 years is to bridge the
residual gaps necessary for UI to become a Center of Excellence for NeuroAIDS Research, not only for Nigeria
but for Africa. This will require 1) developing UI’s capacity in two previously unaddressed NeuroAIDS research
areas of high public health significance, 2) increasing the local mass of externally-funded NeuroAIDS
researchers and mentors, and 3) continuing the progressive transfer of the program’s leadership to UI. The
strategic approach capitalizes on the momentum from our NICHD-funded research, iCARE Nigeria
(UG3/UH3HD096920; MPIs: Babafemi Taiwo and Robert Garofalo), through which we have built trust with
Nigeria’s stigmatized and criminalized sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. We will also leverage
previously untapped, outstanding mental health and stroke research resources at UI. Specific aims have been
articulated. Aim 1a is focused on SGM mental health. Here, we will add new trainees to the existing Mental
Health Core and develop expertise in mental health research and biobehavioral interventions and strategies to
improve the health outcomes of SGM living with and at risk for HIV. Training will span clinical, epidemiological,
socio-behavioral, network, and implementation science. We will enroll 2 postdoctoral faculty members
(physicians or PhDs) per year, mainly from psychiatry or medical social science into customized 2-year
curricula that include tailored didactics, skill building, and mentored research. In Aim 1b, we will tackle stroke in
people living with HIV (PLWH) by adding new trainees to the Clinical and Translational Sciences Core to
unravel the local epidemiology, mechanisms, and interventions for stroke among PLWH. One postdoctoral
faculty per year will be enrolled from neurology, medicine, radiology, or other fields into customized 2-year
curricula as in Aim 1a. Aim 2 is to develop more NeuroAIDS leaders in UI from the best early-career
investigators among those we have trained previously AND by attracting established investigators from other
fields to NeuroAIDS. Here, we will implement “Extended Protected Time” for two competitively selected
previous trainees per year and an innovative “Mentor the Mentor” initiative. In Aim 3, we will advance our
commitment to transfer program ownership and management to UI. Thus, we will implement an MPI structure
with UI co-leadership and new Ibadan NeuroAIDS Grant Writers Coaching Groups. Finally, UI will lead a
regional NeuroAIDS Week every two years to extend the program’s impact beyond UI and cement UI’s
capacity and capability as a Center of Excellence for NeuroAIDS research and capacity development in Africa."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors in human and have
emerged as the largest family of drug targets with more than 35% of all drugs on the market functioning
through GPCRs. Despite their desirability, to date, many GPCR families remain undrugged, partly due to lack
of mechanistic knowledge about their activation and modulation. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)
are members of class C GPCRs and are critical modulators of glutamate signaling. Due to their widespread
expression in tissue and their central role they are among the most promising drug targets for the neurological
disorders such as fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, anxiety, schizophrenia as well as some cancers. Advances in
protein engineering and functional, structural and computational methods in the past twenty years have
provided insights into the architecture, signaling and expression patterns of mGluRs. However, a general
model of how ligands change the shape of mGluRs and how this conformational change is relayed across the
membrane and over 12 nm to activate specific signaling pathways is poorly understood. In this research we will
develop a novel technology that will allow us to watch a single mGluR protein while functioning in
physiological conditions, in real time. This will allow us to quantify the motions of different domains of the
receptor that are involved in signaling. Next, we will employ this approach to study how
synthetic
modulators
of
mGluR
signaling
affect
protein
conformation
and
dynamics
to
cholesterol and
affect receptor
signaling. This is a multi-disciplinary proposal where state-of-the-art in vitro single-molecule FRET (smFRET)
spectroscopy is complemented by live-cell imaging, protein engineering and biophysical and biochemical
methods. Once accomplished, the proposed research could provide a critical step towards rational design of
efficient drugs with fewer undesirable side effects. Furthermore, these studies will provide a general roadmap
for quantitative high-resolution structure-function studies of mammalian membrane proteins."
10916732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The caregiving environment children experience is the most important modifiable feature for shaping brain
development and influencing subsequent mental health. Building from knowledge of infant mental health and
developmental neuroscience, this NIMH BRAINS award application is designed to advance our understanding
of how children’s experiences with their caregivers during infancy, a developmental period characterized by
heightened brain plasticity, influences brain and behavioral development. Specifically, we will use innovative
methods to characterize multiple aspects of the early caregiving environment in relation to changes in brain
structural and functional connectivity that are believed to contribute to the onset of mental disorders. The
application of new tools, coupled with traditional metrics, will improve our measurement of children’s
experiences using a child-centered approach (i.e., capturing children’s contact with multiple caregivers). To do
this, we will recruit 150 women in pregnancy and, following birth, conduct assessments in children’s daily
ecological context at ages 1, 6, 12, and 18 months. This project introduces a wearable device technology that
can dynamically, unobtrusively, and continuously measure patterns of physical proximity between children and
caregivers, regardless of physical location. In addition to children’s proximity to caregivers, we will obtain
ecological assessments of language exposure and observation-based caregiver sensitivity and examine the
convergence and divergence among these different ways of capturing children’s experiences (Specific Aim 1).
While prior research suggests that greater environmental enrichment leads to lower symptoms of
psychopathology, the lack of granularity in measurement (i.e., not capturing the full continuum of relative
psychosocial neglect–enrichment) has precluded the ability to characterize the shape of these associations
(e.g., linear, nonlinear). We will study children selected to range in experiences along the neglect–enrichment
continuum and use repeated neuroimaging of infant brain structural and functional connectivity and repeated
behavioral assessments to explore the possible profile of the associations between aspects of the caregiving
environment and changes in brain and behavior (Specific Aim 2). Last, we will examine how changes in
emotion regulation and emotion reasoning circuitry are associated with signs of emerging psychopathology at
age 18 months in order to test whether, when, and how variations in early experience influence risk for
psychopathology through changes in emotion-related circuitry (Specific Aim 3). Here, neuroimaging is
particularly advantageous as it allows us to examine the maturation of emotion-related networks from birth and,
importantly, prior to the onset of detectable mental health difficulties. Achievement of the aims of this proposal
is expected to meet NIMH’s objectives to determine the biological and psychological mechanisms by which
experience affects neural and behavioral development, with direct applications for prevention and early
intervention."
10914409,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) has infected more than one-third of the world’s population and that almost 296 million
people are currently living with chronic infection including over 6 million children under the age of five. Each year,
about 1.5 million people become newly infected and 820,000 people die from HBV infection and related
complications. Therapeutics for HBV are available, but they hardly lead to a functional cure for chronic HBV
infection. One of the biggest challenges in developing an HBV cure is the lack of immunocompetent animal
models that are susceptible to HBV infection and support the entire life cycle of HBV. HBV has an extremely
narrow host tropism, determined both by species-specific host cellular viral entry receptor, sodium taurocholate
co-transporting peptide (NTCP), and the host factors needed to support the lifecycle of HBV post viral entry.
HBV transgenic mice do not support the formation of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the bona
fide viral transcription template, via the intracellular cccDNA amplification mechanism; genetically modified mice
carrying human NTCP fail to establish HBV infection due to the failure of de novo cccDNA formation. In search
of other laboratory animal species-derived hepatocytes that may support HBV cccDNA formation, our preliminary
studies demonstrated that Ad-HBV-transduced primary hamster hepatocytes (PHaHs) are capable of supporting
HBV DNA replication and cccDNA formation, and Ad-hNTCP-transduced PHaH cells are susceptible to HBV
infection. Hence, the objective of this project is to establish a novel Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model
that is tractable, fully immunocompetent, and highly susceptible for HBV infection. To this end, we will pursue
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Establish a humanized-NTCP (huNTCP) hamster model for HBV
infection. We will use the validated CRISPR-mediated gene editing techniques developed by us in the hamster
to humanize the two codons encoding the key amino acid residues in the hamster NTCP protein required for
HBV infection. Aim 2. Establish acute and chronic infection in the huNTCP hamsters and characterize the
pathogenesis and humoral immune responses to HBV. Under this Aim, we will infect huNTCP hamsters to
establish acute and chronic HBV infections and carry out pathogenesis studies. We will also carry out studies to
characterize the humoral responses during acute and chronic infections. Aim 3. Test direct-acting antivirals
(DAAs), immunoregulators and epigenetic modifiers in suppressing HBV infection in the huNTCP
hamster model. We will test the utility of this immunocompetent huNTCP hamster model in assessing the
efficacies of a selected panel of anti-HBV drugs with different HBV-inhibiting mechanisms, including a direct
acting antiviral (DAA), tenofovir (TDF), an immunoregulator, IFNalpahcon-1, and an epigenetic modifier, MS436,
in suppressing chronic HBV infection. We envision that this novel hamster model will greatly facilitate the
development of new therapeutics that are needed to achieve a functional cure for HBV."

The number of infants exposed to opioids prenatally in the US remains high, with one infant born exposed to
opioids every 15 minutes. Optimal treatment for exposed infants who develop neonatal opioid withdrawal
syndrome (NOWS) has not been established, and randomized comparative effectiveness trials of medications
for NOWS are critically needed. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is uniquely suited to
participate as a clinical site in such a multicenter randomized comparative effectiveness trial. The CCHMC
Perinatal Institute is a large regional perinatal center, providing population-based clinical service for
approximately 25,000 newborns each year. Intrauterine exposure to opioids in the Cincinnati region was
approximately 26 per 1000 live births in 2020, with 10.3 per 1000 developing NOWS requiring pharmacologic
treatment. The proposed PI for this study Stephanie Merhar, proposed alternate PI Scott Wexelblatt, and
proposed follow-up PI Jennifer McAllister all have extensive experience in clinical care, quality improvement,
and clinical research in the NOWS population. The Cincinnati team will provide significant intellectual
contributions to the design of the study, recruit a large number of infants with NOWS to participate, and continue
our tradition of excellent follow-up rates to retain infants in the study to age 2. The expertise and experience of
the investigators and support staff, along with the facilities and population available for study at CCHMC, make
CCHMC a strong site for this proposed study."
10908516,"SUMMARY
Large conductance, voltage- and calcium-activated (BK) channels are a molecular target of ethanol. Our data
indicate that ethanol-induced activation of BK channels facilitates the escalation of voluntary ethanol
consumption in mice made dependent to ethanol. We therefore hypothesize that molecular adaptations resulting
from chronic activation of BK channels by ethanol facilitate the progression to dependence, possibly by lowering
ethanol sensitivity. Accordingly, our project aims to elucidate the molecular identity of BK-dependent adaptations
(Aim 1, R21 phase) and to test their functional implication in the transition to dependence (Aim 2, R33 phase)
and in the control of ethanol sensitivity (Aim 3, R33 phase). We will take advantage of a knockin mouse
expressing BK channels that are insensitive to ethanol but function normally otherwise to identify molecular
adaptations to chronic ethanol that selectively result from the action of ethanol on BK channels. Molecular
adaptations that emerge in brain regions relevant to the motivational and affective effects of ethanol (ventral
tegmental area, amygdala, prelimbic prefrontal cortex, and habenula) will be examined in a well-validated mouse
model of ethanol dependence. We will leverage the unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy of data-independent
acquisition mass spectrometry to quantify changes in protein abundance across the entire proteome.
Furthermore, we will implement weighted correlation network analysis to identify proteins that are the most likely
to drive concerted changes in abundance across modules of co-expressed proteins. Nine of these proteins will
be selected at the end of the R21 phase for functional analysis during the R33 phase. We will use virally mediated
RNA interference to knock down candidate proteins in targeted brain regions and evaluate the influence of these
proteins on the time-course, amplitude and persistence of drinking escalation in ethanol-dependent mice. We
predict that some of the proteins controlling drinking escalation will also control acute sensitivity to ethanol, such
that their up- or down-regulation in ethanol-dependent mice would progressively decrease sensitivity to ethanol.
Accordingly, we will also examine the impact of local protein knockdown on the reinforcing and anxiolytic effects
of ethanol. Altogether, the proposed experiments are designed to identify novel molecular determinants of
vulnerability to alcohol use disorders. Our proposal is relevant to the focus of FOA PAR-18-659 because the
proteins identified in this project may pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity to alcohol
in the human population."
10908518,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) leads to disabling motor impairments, resulting from the degeneration of the
dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway and a loss of dopamine in the striatum. These pathological changes alter the
neuronal activity throughout the basal ganglia. One of the salient changes is that the activity in the motor portion
of the internal pallidal segment (GPi) is increased and abnormally patterned. The currently available medication
or neurosurgical treatments for the symptoms of PD are encumbered by unwanted side effects that frequently
limit their use in patients. Many of the adverse effects of the current therapies undoubtedly result from their lack
of cellular or brain circuit specificity. Minimally invasive methods to reversibly modulate neurons in a selective
manner in the motor territory of the basal ganglia could provide an alternative approach to alleviate parkinsonism
without side effects. We hypothesize that chemogenetic methods that target genetically specified neurons may
be a safer, and at least equally effective alternative. Chemogenetic techniques involve the expression (through
viral vectors) of artificial receptors in specific neurons. These receptors can then be activated by systemically
administered compounds that are otherwise inert. In the planned experiments, we will use a novel chemogenetic
approach, based on the expression of receptor-modulated ligand-gated ion channels, to reduce GPi activity in
rhesus monkeys that have been rendered stably parkinsonian by treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The phenotypic and physiologic similarities between MPTP-induced parkinsonism
and PD make the MPTP-treated monkey an excellent model for this purpose. We have strong preliminary results
indicating that the chemogenetic receptors we plan to use (“Pharmacologically selective actuator molecules”
(PSAMs)) can be successfully expressed in GPi neurons of monkeys using viral vectors, and that systemic
administration of PSAM-activating compounds ameliorate GPi activity, with accompanying changes in
movement. We now plan to evaluate the antiparkinsonian effects of PSAM-mediated inactivation of GPi in MPTP-
treated monkeys (aim 1). In the course of these experiments, we will study the effects of acute or chronic
administration of two PSAM-activating compounds (low doses of varenicline, a clinically approved smoking
cessation drug, or a newly generated “pharmacologically selective effector molecule” (PSEM)). The responses
to these drugs will be compared to those of the gold-standard antiparkinsonian medication, levodopa. Under aim
2, we will examine the pattern and longevity of the PSAM expression in the GPi and will histologically verify that
chronic use of these chemogenetic therapeutic methods do not have identifiable neurotoxic effects. The
proposed studies will help us to develop the PSAM approach into a treatment for parkinsonism, that could offer
notable advantages over the currently available therapies."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Tuberculosis: The Host-Pathogen Interface,
organized by Drs. Marcel Behr, Lalita Ramakrishnan and Kevin Urdahl. The conference will be held in Keystone,
Colorado from March 24-27, 2024.
Each year, tuberculosis afflicts millions of people around the globe, yet many of these individuals are thought to
clear their infections without manifesting disease symptoms. Therefore, understanding why only a fraction of
infected individuals are susceptible to disease represents a critical gap in knowledge that affects a sizeable
patient population. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis lifecycle involves entry, survival, proliferation and exit, and
spans minutes to months or even years. At each step, host opportunities to thwart and eliminate infection can
be overcome by bacterial countermeasures. Therefore, this Keystone Symposia conference was developed to
bring together researchers who study the tuberculosis host-pathogen interface, at the scale of molecules,
individual cells and the cellular aggregates, or granulomas, which are the hallmark structures of tuberculosis.
This program will include sessions that will cover research on nontuberculous mycobacteria and other pathogens
with similar “lifestyle” aspects to M. tuberculosis and will include studies on host processes in other contexts in
order for participants to achieve a more complete understanding of tuberculosis and related pathogens. Finally,
the program will feature emerging tools and methodologies for interrogating the tuberculosis host-pathogen
interface. It is anticipated that this “holistic” approach will enhance understanding of basic infection biology to
inform new strategies for global elimination of this age-old pathogen."

We propose to develop a sensitive, rapid, and affordable CRISPR-based diagnostic test for malaria
parasites. The assay will be simple to run, require no instrumentation or advanced training, and
be suitable for resource-limited regions. In the Phase I, we will design and optimize our multi-
chambered FAST-CRISPR diagnostic using cultured parasites and plasmid DNA targets. Later in
the Phase I or in follow-up studies, we will provide diagnostic kits to laboratories in endemic
regions for beta testing. In Specific Aim 1, we will optimize the selection of oligos used in
isothermal amplification of targeted regions and optimize the lysis process to expose the DNA.
Because reactants from one step of the process flow into the next chamber, we will ensure that
buffer compositions are compatible. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize the CRISPR/Cas12a
reactions for activation of the endonuclease activity upon sensing the target sequences. During
this Aim, we will assess the use of multiple targets and determine assay specificity and sensitivity.
In Specific Aim 3, we will develop the configuration of the FAST device and plan future
manufacturing scale-up."
10922787,"CREST-H Project Summary
Cerebral hemodynamic failure in patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis can impair cognition even if
no overt clinical stroke has occurred, contributing independently to cognitive decline either directly or
because of a higher occurrence of silent infarction. CREST-H addresses the compelling question of whether
carotid revascularization can stabilize or reverse cognitive decline in a subset of patients with asymptomatic,
high-grade carotid stenosis who have cerebral hemodynamic failure related to the carotid stenosis. Although
there is mounting evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that hemodynamic impairment affects
cognition in patients with carotid occlusive disease, treatment of this condition has never been tested in a
randomized clinical trial. CREST-H has just passed 65% of target enrollment, a process slowed by the
pandemic. This grant renewal will allow us to complete the (revised) target enrollment for CREST-H.
Randomization in CREST-H is done within the parent trial, CREST-2, which comprises a pair of outcome-
blinded, Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis, comparing
stroke prevention and death for either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) plus
intensive medical management (IMM) versus IMM alone. CREST-2 has just received notice of funding for an
additional 5 years. Hemodynamic impairment is measured by an inter-hemispheral MRI or CT perfusion “time
to peak” (TTP) delay on the side of stenosis. Patients with baseline hemodynamic impairment return for
follow up brain imaging at 1 year. For those who are found to have baseline hemodynamic failure and
cognitive impairment, the cognitive batteries at baseline and at 1 year will determine if those who are
assigned to a revascularization arm in CREST-2 will have better cognitive outcomes than those in the
medical-only arm. That treatment difference will be compared with the treatment difference among those who
have no flow failure, that is, there will be a significant flow-failure-by-treatment interaction. We postulate that
hemodynamically significant “asymptomatic” carotid disease may represent one of the few examples of a
treatable cause of cognitive impairment. If cognitive decline can be arrested in these patients, then we will
have established a new indication for carotid revascularization independent of the risk of recurrent stroke."

Approximately 70% of all new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are among populations of sexual
and gender minorities (SGM) and are primarily attributable to sexual contact.1 Currently only 26% of the U.S.
population who would benefit from HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are prescribed this effective
biomedical HIV prevention strategy2 that would help achieve the “Ending the HIV Epidemic” (EHE) goals that
targets a 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 20303. Biomedical prevention strategies for bacterial sexually
transmitted infections (STI) like doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (DoxyPEP) are a vital component to the
successes EHE given the well-known association between STIs and risk for HIV infection4,5. Increases in
biomedical prevention depend on the individual and interpersonal factors of the clients accessing care and the
clinicians who provide the care6. Understanding these, and numerous other potential factors specific to
community and society may better inform the approach to HIV and STI biomedical prevention strategies in the
primary care setting. In this mixed methods study, we will leverage group concept mapping and conduct focus
groups with identified stakeholder groups (e.g., SGM clients and primary care clinicians) to (1) Describe
approaches from SGM client perspectives that facilitate awareness, uptake, and persistence of biomedical
prevention (same day PrEP & DoxyPEP) in the primary care setting, (2) describe approaches from primary
care clinician perspectives that facilitate awareness, uptake, and persistence of biomedical prevention (same
day PrEP & DoxyPEP) in the primary care setting and (3) identify the joint priorities of clients and clinicians
(high-feasibility and high-importance) for the integration of same day PrEP and DoxyPEP in primary care.
Clients and clinicians have a wealth of knowledge and experience and can provide unique perspectives
specific to factors influencing HIV and STI biomedical prevention awareness, uptake, and persistence.
Findings will inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions to improve the HIV and STI
biomedical prevention strategies in the primary care setting. The proposed research and training plan aligns
with the National Institute of Nursing Research Strategic Plan on health equity, systems and models of care,
prevention/promotion, and population health. The proposed study builds on the applicant’s knowledge of health
equity and disparities, improvement in biomedical HIV and STI prevention, and mixed methods approaches.
Training will focus on developing proficiency in mixed methods, building expertise in SGM-affirming health and
healthcare approaches for vulnerable populations, and advance the scientific understanding of HIV and STI
prevention within sexual and gender minorities through scholarly writing and the dissemination of research
findings. The training plan and mentorship team will prepare the applicant for a career as an independent
researcher conducting rigorous mixed methods research on health inequity and HIV/STI disparities among
SGM."
10916717,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a rapidly escalating public health crisis with recent evidence suggesting that
close to 70% of drug overdose deaths involved opioids in the last year. Medications for OUD (MOUDs) such as
buprenorphine and methadone are the frontline treatment for OUD, yet over half of individuals who initiate
MOUD relapse or leave treatment in the first year, highlighting the importance of adjunctive therapies that
might improve OUD treatment outcomes. Insomnia is a common and often recalcitrant issue among persons
on MOUDs but there is little guidance on how to ameliorate symptoms of insomnia during OUD treatment. The
orexin (or hypocretin) neurotransmitter system plays a role in insomnia and in the onset, progression, and
maintenance of OUD. Suvorexant is a dual-orexin receptor antagonists that is FDA-approved for the treatment
of insomnia, and data from our group suggests that suvorexant might be especially efficacious in treating
insomnia in persons with OUD and may also confer collateral benefits including decreased opioid craving and
symptoms of withdrawal. Moreover, suvorexant has an excellent safety profile and did not result in increased
adverse events or measures of abuse potential when compared to placebo in our pilot study. The proposed
study is an FDA-regulatory-grade Phase III multisite randomized-controlled trial of suvorexant versus placebo
in persons with insomnia who are utilizing long-term MOUD treatment. Participants who are prescribed
buprenorphine or methadone for OUD will be screened to determine study eligibility. Eligible individuals will be
enrolled for an 8-week study that includes the following conditions: one night double-dummy placebo lead-in
prior to randomization; ~8 weeks of suvorexant or placebo where the dose may be escalated from 10 mg to 20
mg after 3 nights (consistent with current suvorexant label instructions); and two-nights double-dummy placebo
lead-out to examine discontinuation effects. In lab polysomnography (PSG) will be used to at the beginning
and end of the trial to determine the primary endpoint of change from baseline total sleep time. Adverse events
and other indicators of patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. Participants will also be assessed
for OUD treatment outcomes including regular urine toxicology and trajectories of mental health during the
study. Specific Aims of the study are to (Aim 1) evaluate the efficacy of suvorexant versus placebo in treat
insomnia in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim1) Evaluate the safety of
suvorexant versus placebo in persons taking buprenorphine or methadone for OUD treatment, (Aim 3) submit
a Supplement Application of Efficacy to the FDA to support an update to the label of suvorexant, and
(Exploratory Aim 4) determine whether suvorexant versus placebo improves OUD treatment outcomes. The
results of this important study will inform treatment providers on whether suvorexant is safe and effective for
insomnia in persons with OUD, and exploratory results will further our scientific understanding of the role of the
orexin system in OUD treatment and recovery."

The ability to engineer living cells as intelligent therapeutic agents is poised to transform current cancer treatment
paradigms. Based on the inherent growth specificity of some natural and exogenous bacteria to solid tumors,
microbes have been explored as programmed vehicles to deliver therapeutics to tumor environments. However,
a universal challenge for developing this next-generation living therapy is the lack of tools to study the dynami-
cally interacting population of bacteria and cancer cells. Consequently, the vast majority of the past studies have
relied on animal models that only test a handful of therapeutic candidates and provide limited spatiotemporal
information. To address this challenge, I have recently developed a 3D multicellular coculture platform that ena-
bles high-throughput characterization of bacteria in tumor spheroids, assessing dynamics of multicellular inter-
actions and predicting therapeutic efficacy in vivo.
 In this proposal, I will leverage the 3D coculture technologies and synthetic biology tools to construct novel
bacterial systems that sense and express therapeutics specifically in tumors. In the F99 phase, I will engineer
tumor-homing bacteria to dynamically regulate production of cytotoxic molecules in response to tumor shrinkage.
Specifically, as the cancer cell death increases the level of oxygen in the tumor core, I will engineer a bacterial
biosensor circuit to monitor this change in the tumor microenvironment. By detecting rises in oxygen levels,
which indicate extensive therapeutic progression, this gene circuit will reduce the therapeutic level produced,
minimizing off-target toxicity. In the K00 phase, I will repurpose tumor-homing bacteria to target and eradicate
oncogenic F. nucleatum in colorectal cancer. I will apply the 3D coculture platform to screen anti-F. nucleatum
peptides delivered by bacteria to tumor spheroids. Orthotropic mouse cancer models will be used to assess the
F. nucleatum elimination, effect on commensal microbiota, and cancer progression. Collectively, the proposed
work will utilize a novel engineering framework to develop effective bacterial cancer therapies towards clinical
translation."

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer associated deaths in men in the United States. The first
line of treatment for men with advanced metastatic prostate cancer is hormone therapy. Although initial
responses are observed, unfortunately, the disease commonly recurs in its aggressive hormone therapy-
resistant form, which is largely responsible for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Thus, there is an urgent need
to define the mechanisms that drive the aggressive disease.
We have recently shown that UCHL1 protein is implicated in regulating aggressive prostate cancer growth and
prostate cancer metastasis. We have strong preliminary evidence suggesting that UCHL1 may be a new
promising therapeutic target for aggressive prostate cancer. We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of
UCHL1 suppresses prostate cancer growth.
The main goals of the proposed project are:
1) test the functional role of UCHL1 in advanced prostate cancer.
2) investigate the molecular mechanism through which UCHL1 signals in aggressive prostate cancer.
3) test the therapeutic potential of UCHL1 inhibition in animal models of aggressive disease and patient-derived
 xenografts in preclinical settings.
Successful completion of the proposed research will lead to: 1) defining the role of UCHL1 in aggressive therapy-
resistant prostate cancer, 2) the discovery of new molecular mechanisms underlying UCHL1 function and the
development of aggressive prostate cancer which will guide us towards novel therapeutic strategies to target the
advanced disease and 3) direct new strategies regarding novel therapeutic interventions to combat the deadly
form of the disease."

Determining the detailed structural characteristics of biomolecules relevant to human health and disease
is one of the most crucial tools in our arsenal for understanding disease etiology and mechanism, and for
being able to develop new therapeutics that target these molecular entities. There are new techniques in
structural biology, including serial femtosecond crystallography, serial synchrotron crystallography, and
microcrystal electron diffraction, that have the potential to greatly advance structure determination of
biomolecules and to empower access to structural details that have deﬁed characterization via other
structural methods. These new structural methods all rely on being able to generate, detect and
appropriately handle extremely small crystalline samples of biomolecules. This requirement for sub-
micron sized crystals is one of the key features of these technologies, and presents a major obstacle
to the advancement of these methods for structure determination. This proposal presents innovative
technologies for both image analysis and sample handling expressly designed to address the speciﬁc
challenges of working with submicron crystals. We plan to use nonlinear optical microscopy methods
coupled with purpose-built application of point process modeling and wavelet image analysis approaches
to provide computational tools needed to enable detection and characterization of submicron samples
that are invisible to the brightﬁeld microscopy tools that are typically used in sample generation and
experimental set up for crystal based structural biology. In addition, we will examine different ﬁxed target
platforms to reduce sample handling, minimizing potential crystal damage, as well as test use of acoustic
droplet ejection techniques for nanoliter volume sample transfer. These innovations will be a powerful
addition to structural biology toolbox for leveraging the cutting edge diffraction based methods currently
available for structure determination. These technology developments will break through key barriers to
the widespread use of these cutting edge structural methods."

The overall goal of this Program Project is to test the novel hypothesis that vascular endothelial cells (EC) serve
as an immune active niche in the lungs during injury and repair. The Cellular Imaging Core (Core C) is essential
for accurate identification and tracking of the spatiotemporal organization and expression of specific molecules
in the EC regulating the immune niche. The function of the Core is to provide advanced reagents and imaging
methodologies required for both in vitro and in vivo analysis of immune function and to enable testing of the
hypotheses across the Program. We will provide the tools to address how the active regulation of endothelial
cell-surface receptor signaling and mitophagy-mediated recognition of phagocytes by EC promote innate
immune signaling in the lung. To gain the mechanistic signaling insights needed for the success of each Project,
the Core will provide methods at both the conventional and super-resolution levels to identify and interrogate the
signaling pathways. Using multi-channel microscopy and super-resolution activity imaging, we will study
spatiotemporal signaling induced through internalization of tyrosine phosphorylated sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor1 (S1PR1) in EC and the role of the EC-expressed ubiquitin ligase CFHR in regulating VE-cadherin
expression and function. These analyses will permit a fine-grained assessment of the time-sequence and spatial
organization of the immune signaling in lung EC and how it impacts lung function. By providing a seamless visual
examination of a wide range of signaling activities in individual EC downstream of above listed EC-receptors
during inflammatory injury and repair, the Core is essential for supporting and testing the molecular and

transcription, and are mis-regulated in many diseases. With CRISPR-targeting techniques, we can write
particular chromatin modifications and then measure how gene expression changes in response. This will enable
us to understand how gene expression changes in disease states and how to rationally design therapeutics to
reverse those changes.
 One of the challenges to using CRISPR perturbations to study non-coding regulatory elements is CRISPR off-
target activity. Here, we show that off-target effects in non-coding perturbation experiments can be associated
with significant toxicity in human cells, not only with DNA-cleaving Cas9, but also with epigenome-modifying
CRISPRi/a tools. After removing off-target-prone guide RNAs, we can use CRISPR to accurately link non-coding
regulatory elements with genes.
 These perturbation experiments are critical to learn the causal functions of chromatin modifications at
specific genomic elements. However, most experiments to date have used CRISPRi, with one particular KRAB
domain that establishes one particular heterochromatin state. Existing tools to manipulate chromatin state are
largely drawn from a small fraction of the thousands of natural chromatin regulatory complexes; most suffer from
partial or transient effects, and exhibit high variability across loci and cell types. A more complete toolbox of
compact, efficient domains for pathway-specific chromatin perturbations will transform our ability to determine
the causal function of particular chromatin modifications across the human genome. Here, we propose to
systematically measure the gene expression effects of recruiting chromatin regulator protein domains to a
promoter. This is made possible by our recent development of a high-throughput chromatin regulator recruitment
assay in human cells, capable of measuring activity for tens of thousands of regulator domains simultaneously.
Using this system, we will recruit-and-release CR variants from the promoter, and then measure the magnitude
and permanence of transcriptional silencing at a reporter locus. We will then use epigenomic mapping assays to
determine the chromatin modifications that underpin the silencing functions of these novel chromatin regulators.
After characterizing thousands of domains drawn from all the different chromatin regulatory complexes, we will
create and share a detailed resource of compact and efficient domains that can be fused onto CRISPR DNA-
binding proteins in order to recruit desired chromatin regulatory complexes to act upon a genomic element.
 In order to positively impact human health with these approaches, I propose to leverage this training to
develop new methods that dissect transcriptional dysregulation in kidney disease during the postdoctoral phase."
10914026,"Project Abstract:
 Recent research has highlighted the importance of human associated microbiota in many diseases and health
conditions. Nowadays marker-gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics sequencing (jointly, MGS) have been
routinely used in epidemiological and clinical studies to investigate the health impact of the microbiome commu-
nity. In the public domain, many researchers now deposit MGS data together with other data for other researchers
to investigate. Despite being increasingly available, MGS data analysis remains difﬁcult. In addition to the classic
statistical challenges inherent to MGS data such as the compositionality, the sparsity, the over dispersion and the
phylogenetic relationship between taxa, large scale MGS studies feature additional complications including the
experimental bias and hidden artifacts (batch effects), which will invalidate downstream analysis if not accounted
for properly. Current analytic approaches largely ignore or insufﬁciently handle these difﬁculties.
 This proposal aims to develop powerful and robust statistical methods for reproducible microbiome discoveries
that adjust for unknown batch effects and are resistant to sequencing biases. In aim 1, we will develop a novel
approach to search for unmeasured artifacts through a novel surrogate variable analysis and multiple quantile
thresholding. Our approach advances the existing surrogate variable analysis approach to speciﬁcally address
the characteristics of MGS data including the differences in variabilities, the sparsity and the zero inﬂation. In
aims 2 & 3, we develop bias resistant modeling for assessing microbiome-phenotype association and community
level analysis. We will also develop, distribute and support user-friendly software for the proposed methods to
beneﬁt the entire research community. The proposed methods will be evaluated against extensive simulations
and analysis of real microbiome data including data from our motivating studies as in VAPing Observational
Research Study (VAPORS) and the New Hampshire birth cohort study. Successful completion of this proposal
will ﬁll the gap between the increasing research interest in microbiome and the lack of robust and bias-resistant
tools, and facilitate our in-depth understanding of human microbiome in health and disease."

In situ immunofluorescence imaging is a powerful method to study the locations, expression levels and
structures of proteins in cells and tissues. In particular, multiplexed imaging reveals the interaction networks
of proteins, which allows us to understand the underlying mechanisms of many diseases. However, it has
been challenging to perform multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging due to its extremely time-consuming
process, high cost and lack of signal amplification. The limited spatial resolution achievable with confocal
microscopy often fails to reveal complex spatial organization and to determine localizations of proteins. Here
we propose super-multiplexed immunofluorescence nanoscopy that is capable of imaging more than twenty
different proteins in 24 hours with nanoscale resolution. We will employ DNA-barcoded secondary nanobodies
that are monovalent, open-source and designed for quantitative labeling. Repeated introduction and washing
of fluorescent DNA imagers will generate highly multiplexed images. Moreover, we will develop
unprecedentedly fast stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy that employs a parallelized line array
of doughnut beams. It will feature a large imaging area and excellent optical sectioning capability. Photon
reassignment, hyperspectral imaging and deep-learning will further facilitate rapid super-resolution-based
protein profiling. Our new biochemical and optical tools will play crucial roles in diverse biomedical areas
including brain proteomics and cancer profiling."

Morphogenesis is the biological process by which cells, tissues, and organs acquire the shape that is critical to
their function during embryonic development, and it can be repurposed during regeneration of tissues after
damage in a mature organism. Work on embryonic explants has revealed that differences in cellular
morphologies and mechanical cell-cell interactions, both controlled by signaling molecules, likely drive tissue-
specific shapes in multiple epithelial tissues including the symmetric murine molar. Nevertheless, a deeper
understanding of the basic principles and cellular behaviors that regulate morphogenesis is required to leverage
these processes for future regenerative therapies that can mitigate the effects of aging and disease.
I will use the early developmental stages of the murine incisor to study how cell behaviors drive directional growth
and morphogenesis. Murine incisor development is highly asymmetric, and the mechanisms regulating this
process have remained elusive. Prior studies have shown that perturbations in Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling
result in abnormal incisor morphology, and that Shh-dependent cell movement drives tooth bud invagination in
the symmetrical molar. Through this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that modulation of the Shh signaling
cascade drives changes in cellular morphology and behavior that determine the asymmetric morphogenic
development of the incisor. I will measure and quantify localized cellular and tissue morphological changes such
as cell shape, nuclear position, and tooth curvature, as well as dynamic cell behaviors such as differential
proliferation, oriented cell division, and cell intercalation, using high resolution live imaging and our novel
software program, MARGARITA. This will establish a foundational atlas of cell morphologies and behaviors
responsible for the epithelial bending events driving early development of the asymmetric incisor (Aim 1). Next,
pharmacological perturbation of Shh signaling in incisor explants and spatiotemporal modulation of Shh
expression in genetic mutants will determine to what extent the modulation of this signal transduction pathway
affects cellular morphology during incisor development (Aim 2). These findings will provide significant insights
into basic tooth and developmental biology, which have the potential to be applied towards future dental
regenerative therapies. Current strategies to restore missing dentition (i.e., implants, dentures) can lead to
significant bone resorption or may fail due to limited osseointegration. Thus, biologically regenerating teeth using
morphogenesis-driven techniques has the potential to significantly improve restorative dentistry.
These research goals will be conducted in conjunction with a comprehensive training plan designed to develop
my career as a dentist-scientist. Training includes structured mentorship from two highly qualified sponsors, as
well as scientific and technical training through meetings, seminars, journal clubs, and classes at UCSF, which
offers both an outstanding research environment and an excellent dental school for clinical training."
10914683,"Project Summary/Abstract
Both soft and hard tissue wound healing are impaired in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Diabetes negatively impacts
fracture healing, bone regeneration and osseointegration of endosseous implants. The complex physiological
changes associated with diabetes are often manifest in immunological responses to wounding and repair where
macrophages play a prominent role in determining outcomes. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the
immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology and immunomodulation of bone repair is affected by key
interaction involving macrophages and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Yet, a fundamental knowledge gap
exists with respect to the nature of and the mechanisms that govern this interaction in the presence of T2DM.
My recent published study has revealed that the conditioned medium from diabetic mouse macrophages impairs
osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. My studies also show that macrophages secrete phenotype-dependent
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that affect the level of bone repair. Here, I hypothesize that diabetic macrophage
EVs mediate specific paracrine control of osteogenesis. To test this hypothesis, I propose two independent but
thematically related aims. In Aim 1, I will characterize and compare wild type mouse macrophage EVs
(wtEVs) and diabetic mouse macrophage EVs (dbEVs) at the structural and functional level and define the
effects of these EVs on MSC osteogenic differentiation quantitatively. I will demonstrate the role of macrophage
miRNAs cargo on osteoinduction by interfering miRNA function in Argonaute 2 (involved in RISC complex
formation and miRNA function) knockdown MSCs. In addition, I will validate that dbEVs contain miRNAs that
negatively influence the process of osteogenesis by generating EVs from DICER (required for mature miRNA
formation) knockout macrophages. In Aim 2, I will identify significantly distinct miRNAs in dbEVs, their target
genes and signaling pathways involved in osteogenesis by bioinformatic approach. I will evaluate the
functionality of these miRNAs on osteoinduction by utilizing mimics/antagomirs that increase or eliminate the
effects of identified miRNAs. I will study selected target genes at the level of miRNA interaction to affirm the
direct effects on gene regulation and downstream effects of these key miRNAs on osteoinductive pathways.
Translationally, I will generate functionally engineered EVs (FEEs) by engineer the candidate miRNAs (promote
osteogenesis) that rescue dbEV effects into MSC EVs. The FEEs will be characterized structurally and
functionally in vitro. Further I will utilize calvarial bone defect model to evaluate the function of selected miRNAs
within FEEs on bone healing in diabetic mice. Overall, these mechanistic studies will explore the significance of
the macrophage EV-mediated immunomodulation that occurs between macrophages and MSCs in the context
of bone healing in the presence of T2DM. These studies will refine knowledge of diabetic pathology and provide
potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
10915199,"Rare genetic diseases affect 3.5-6% of the population and are associated with diagnostic odysseys that can
last up to decades. As first steps towards shortening diagnostic odysseys for infants and toddlers, we
developed rules-based and natural language processing- (NLP-) based algorithms to identify infants and
children aged 0–3 years who were typically ill. Our algorithms were accurate for identify atypical ill patients at
these ages from electronic health records (EHRs). Cohorts so identified were strongly enriched for patients
who had undergone genetic testing. Manual EHR review for such atypically ill patient who had never been
evaluated for a rare genetic disease revealed that 52% could appropriately be referred for such an evaluation.
 During the UG3 phase, we will create a novel outpatient clinic, Mount Sinai Genetics Outreach (GO), staffed
with medical geneticists with prior pediatric and internal medicine training, to evaluate patients identified by our
EHR phenotyping algorithms. In a pilot study, we will deploy rules- and NLP-based algorithms to identify 200
children aged 0-12 years with >50% risk of having an undiagnosed rare genetic trait. We will survey
pediatricians at five practices for baseline knowledge about diagnostic odysseys and genetic testing, provide
education about the topic and then study the impact of our algorithm deployment. For patients referred to
Mount Sinai GO, we will determine the outcomes of clinical genetic evaluations and diagnostic testing,
including impact on subsequent health care. In order to improve our existing algorithms, we developed an
automated abstraction engine that identifies patients diagnosed with 164 rare genetic disorders with 83%
accuracy. We will expand this to more traits and use their EHR data to improve our pediatric EHR phenotyping
algorithms. The goal is to increase sensitivity, currently at ~25%, without dropping precision below 50%.
 During the UH3 phase, we will deploy our optimized rare disease-detecting algorithms in a non-academic
health care setting, Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital, a non-academic community hospital setting without
onsite medical genetic services. Our model will leverage pandemic-accelerated expertise in telehealth to
facilitate access of underserved populations to genetics services. Our goal will be to achieve similar sensitivity
and precision with our pediatric algorithms as well as a comparably successful referral mechanism. Also, we
will extend our clinical rule-based and NLP algorithms to detect adolescent and adult patients likely to have
rare genetic disorders and assess the impact of our approach on diagnostic odysseys. We will alter our
pediatric rules-based algorithm, first to patients aged 12-21 years and then to younger adults. We will leverage
our automated abstraction engine for rare genetic disease for iterative improvements. For adults, we will class
traits by organ system in order to improve cohort size/statistical power. Finally, we will assemble and study
information about diagnostic odysseys per se, including the impact of our algorithms in shortening them."

In this collaborative project we will develop a system for the automation and execution of chemical reactions
across a range of hardware and scales for the synthesis of known and unknown molecules. This work will
leverage the last 6 years of progress in our laboratory on the Chemputer (a programmable chemical synthesis
robot) and the principle of Chemputation (the concept that a chemical synthesis expressed in a type of chemical
code can be run on any compatible hardware reliably). Three specific aims are proposed: 1. To develop the
chemical programming language standard that will run the synthesis protocols; 2. Development of modular plug
and play hardware for chemical synthesis including interfaces to 3rd party systems; 3. Creation of a reaction
screening system for chemical synthesis and discovery. These aims will be developed over the five-year period
in a highly integrated and collaborative working modus operandi with NCATS. During years 1-2 we will work on
all three Specific Aims by developing specifications, implementation plans, prototypes, test integration concepts,
and this will be followed by, in years 3-5, cycles of deployment, integration, and testing at NCATS. By developing
an operational programming language for chemical synthesis that can specify the requirements for the reactions
precisely, we will ensure that programmable chemistry, like computation, can become universal on compatible
hardware. The programming language we will develop is based on our chemical description language, χDL (1.0),
which is open source. We will introduce more powerful functions e.g., for loops and if when conditions so that
χDL (2.0) will be equivalent to a functional computer programming language, but rather than being used for
computation, χDL (2.0) will be for chemical operations. This upgrade in functionality is important since the
language will become more portable and universal. This is because the language will not be dependent upon
external languages not suitable for chemistry automation. This system will be validated at Glasgow and NCATS
using a range of well-known reactions covering the span of organic chemistry and will involve several case
studies demonstrating how newly discovered chemistry can be encoded. We will also explore a range of
synthesis scales and new approaches to liquid-liquid and solid-liquid extraction systems using state of the art
membrane technologies for purification and library development. The system will be used to optimise existing
chemical reactions and targets as well as explore for new targets using a machine learning system. A modular
analytics software system-bridge will include NMR, IR, MS, and HPLC to provide real-time feedback. The project
outcomes will be the identification, design, synthesis, and validation of new chemical entities as starting points
for drug development of novel targets, and the expansion of chemical space available for drug screening. The
project will have a lead at NCATS and Glasgow, and the teams will be jointly coordinated with a management
team that will be meeting formally every month, with frequent weekly and bi-weekly meetings, and quarterly
reviews. A steering committee will review progress and give advice to the teams."

While preventive care guidance recommends primary care providers deliver sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH) care to male adolescents (ages 12 and older), males’ SRH care receipt is poor. Clinic-based 
interventions can be valuable SRH promotion tools for adolescents. However, they have mainly focused on 
pregnancy prevention for females, single topics (STIs, HIV) rather than the recommended SRH care package, 
or specific male groups (e.g., men who have sex with men) rather than inclusive of the diversity of males 
encompassing the full range of gender identities, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and risk behaviors. 
Computer-based approaches make it easier to consistently provide evidence-based SRH, in multiple 
languages, tailored to the diverse needs of all adolescents. Using such approaches before the clinic visit can 
also help overcome providers’ barriers, such as time constraints, to improve SRH care. Yet, we are not aware 
of any computer-based strategy to promote recommended SRH care for diverse groups of males. Neglecting 
males in evidence-based SRH care fails to meet their own needs, and compromises their partners’ health. 
Health-E You/Salud iTu is a pre-visit, individually tailored, interactive, web-based mobile intervention 
shown to improve contraceptive knowledge and use among adolescent females 6 months later and prime and 
extend providers’ ability to deliver individually tailored contraceptive care to female patients. We will adapt the 
current Health-E You for male adolescents to assess their SRH needs; provide interactive, individually tailored, 
evidence-based SRH information; support SRH decision-making and visit priorities; and support providers’ 
ability to individually tailor recommended SRH care. We will then evaluate its acceptability, usability, 
satisfaction, and efficacy on SRH care receipt and method use among diverse groups of male adolescents 
presenting for care at school-based health centers (SBHCs), by leveraging the infrastructure of a current 
PCORI-funded trial with 28 SBHCs in 11 states focused on assigned females sex at birth. It will also support 
providers in delivering the recommended SRH care package for males. In this R01 proposal, we propose to (1) 
adapt Health-E You as a pre-visit, individually tailored, interactive, SRH care tool for use with diverse groups of 
male adolescents employing a Youth-Centered Health Design Process with input from an advisory board of 
male adolescents and providers; (2) ensure its acceptability, usability, and satisfaction among male adolescent 
patients and providers in SBHCs using an iterative design approach; and (3) test its efficacy to improve 
sexually active male adolescent patients’ knowledge, self-efficacy, beliefs, and behaviors related to SRH care 
after the visit and method use 2 months later. The current proposal would be the first to examine the 
acceptability, usability, satisfaction, and efficacy of a pre-visit, computer-based intervention to engage sexually 
active male adolescent patients in SRH care and method use, where currently no such strategy exists."

In 2000, Emory University partnered with a consortium of Atlanta historically Black colleges and universities
called the Atlanta University Center (AUC) to form our IRACDA program (Fellowships In Research and Science
Teaching or FIRST). This partnership between Emory University, a research-intensive university, and these
Minority Serving Institutions (MSI; Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and
Morehouse School of Medicine) has focused on providing our Scholars with outstanding research experiences
at Emory combined with training and immersive experiences in teaching at the AUC schools. Thus, FIRST
Scholars develop both their academic research credentials and teaching credentials, both of which will be
important in their later academic life. FIRST also supports the AUC as FIRST Scholars develop new courses
and laboratory modules as well as mentor undergraduates from underrepresented groups in research projects.
With these additional educational opportunities through FIRST, these undergraduates that are women and/or
from underrepresented groups are also exposed to enthusiastic, research-oriented teachers and role models —
many of whom are also women and/or from underrepresented groups — who have been successful in graduate
school and postdoctoral academic environments. Our Partner Institutions are also positively impacted as FIRST
alumni, former Emory Postdoctoral Fellows, become AUC academic leaders and reinforce dynamic interactions
among AUC faculty and Emory. Throughout its history, this program has been highly successful in recruiting and
preparing a diverse pool of FIRST Scholars. Overall, 67% of our trainees are in highly competitive research
positions and 15% in tenure-track posts at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). In this current funding period,
FIRST successfully filled six positions each year. A number of those recruited subsequently obtained extramural
funding. Of the 82 FIRST Scholars, 76% were women and 62% were from underrepresented groups. These
successes reflect our exceptional program. Our programmatic objectives in this competitive renewal are to build
on these achievements as follows: 1) Provide Scholars with exemplary research and professional training that
promotes their research, career, and leadership development; 2) At the AUC schools, expand evidenced-based
teaching and biomedical research opportunities to engage early stage STEM students that are women and/or
from underrepresented groups; 3) Increase the number of highly qualified STEM Postdoctoral Fellows from
women and/or underrepresented groups entering competitive academic and biomedical careers. Through the
FIRST Program, Emory is the only research-intensive institution in Georgia that provides comprehensive training
in research and teaching for early career scientists. Continuation of FIRST will allow us to continue training and
preparing STEM Postdoctoral Fellows that are sensitive to the MSI culture and, ultimately, will be in a position
to serve as life-long guides and role models in academia and other research-related positions. By leveraging this
training infrastructure, our goal is to expand the impact of FIRST to non-IRACDA funded Postdoctoral Fellows."

Despite successful cervical cancer screening in the United States (US), over 13,000 women develop and 4,000
women die from cervical cancer each year. The discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the necessary
cause of cervical cancer precipitated a surge of new evidence and development of innovative HPV-based
technologies, both screening and prophylactic vaccination, that have allowed for significant changes in our
approach to cervical cancer control over the past two decades. These new technologies represent tremendous
opportunities for effective, equitable, and efficient cervical cancer programs in the US but also pose significant
challenges for decision-making. Given the limited availability of outcomes data for new screening and
vaccination approaches from empirical studies, policy-makers have become uniquely reliant on mathematical
modeling to provide a synthesized evidence base for decision-making for cervical cancer control strategies.
These models can be used to integrate the most up-to-date data, extrapolate short-term findings into long-term
outcomes, and evaluate what-if scenarios that would otherwise be impractical or infeasible to conduct in
clinical studies. The proposed CISNET project will represent the continued, productive collaboration of five
independent modeling groups from the US, Australia, and the Netherlands that will leverage a series of state-
of-the-art mathematical models of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis for comparative modeling. We will pursue
analyses related to the impact of newly-revised screening and HPV vaccination guidelines, the comparative
effectiveness of forthcoming screening and HPV vaccination strategies and approaches, the optimal routes for
reducing cervical cancer disparities, the potential for cervical cancer elimination in the US, and optimal
screening and vaccination strategies in women living with HIV. Our efforts will also involve wide dissemination
of findings to various stakeholders to increase transparency and confidence in model-based analyses."
10915673,"Abstract
Successful regeneration of tissues requires transient increases in stem cell plasticity, proliferation, and
differentiation, in order to produce new cells that integrate with preexisting tissues and organs. Pathways
governing these critical behaviors have been identified, but how injury signals can trigger stem cell proliferation
and differentiation of cells necessary for regeneration remains poorly understood. In most model organisms,
regenerative capacity is limited and stem cells are scarce, which has made it difficult to pinpoint the
mechanisms regulating stem cell proliferation and differentiation after injury. By contrast, the planarian
flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea has abundant stem cells that are activated by injury and fuel continuous
regeneration. Like embryonic stem cells, planarian stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into any type of
tissue. These pluripotent stem cells can be readily identified, monitored, purified, and thoroughly profiled at the
molecular level. We recently made two important discoveries that form the foundation of this proposal. First,
injury of any type appears to protect stem cells from lethal radiation, because it halts the cell cycle and fewer
stem cells undergo apoptosis. Second, we pioneered a chemical method to selectively remove a single organ,
the pharynx. Pharynx regeneration requires the upregulation of the conserved Forkhead transcription factor
FoxA in a discrete subset of stem cells immediately after this targeted injury. We find that the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a central driver of these behaviors. ERK promotes differentiation in cultured
stem cells, but how it is activated after injury is poorly understood. Together, these findings establish our
central hypothesis, which is that injury synchronizes the cell cycle, enabling local cues to channel stem cell
differentiation toward discrete cell fates. In Aim 1, we will determine how injury induces cell cycle arrest in stem
cells after radiation. We will examine DNA repair and test the function of conserved genes that are upregulated
after injury. In Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanisms driving organ-specific regeneration by purification and
single-cell sequencing of stem cells proliferating after organ loss. We will identify receptors enriched on these
cells, and test their function in organ regeneration to determine if they act upstream of FoxA. In Aim 3, we will
identify the upstream receptors that activate MAP kinase signaling in stem cells with combinations of RNAi,
pharmacology and biochemistry. This proposal exploits our ability to challenge stem cells with precise insults,
providing a lens into the mechanisms that enable flexible stem cell responses during injury and homeostasis.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern stem cell behavior in a physiologically-relevant context
will inform the design of future strategies for regenerative medicine technologies."

The Pathogen Data Network (PDN) will nucleate global networks around the mobilization of diverse biodata
types, including host and pathogen genomics, transcriptomics, proteins, pathways and networks, imaging and
cohorts. The integration and linkage of these data for the purposes of research and public health response will
be made possible through the development of a technical framework including specifications, standards,
interfaces and reference software implementations. All the publicly available data to be integrated with further
datasets and tools from a range of pathogen-related data resources will be made accessible and re-usable
under the Pathogens Portal (PP), hosted at EMBL-EBI, and within distributed local Pathogen Portals (LPP),
hosted globally and enabling additional functionalities to be customized for the specific local context. To foster
data mobilization, PDN will establish a network of FAIR Local Data Hubs (LDH) based on reference software
implementations to be deployed on locally controlled cloud infrastructure, ideally in countries having signed the
Nagoya Protocol. To achieve trustworthy and equitable sharing of the mobilized data to international
repositories, legally compliant with local regulations as well as aligned to international policy, we will also
address in-depth issues of trust and ownership and work to provide data-sharing policy options for international
and national organizations, ensuring alignment of the PDN project with international policy and its wide adoption
by end users. This will include LDH focusing on Low and Middle Income Countries. In parallel, we will establish
a LDH Managers' community of practice to exchange knowledge and expertise, with a focus on capacity
building, harmonization and preparedness. Data Hubs (DH) hosted centrally will continue existing in parallel,
supporting those who lack capacity, resource or expertise to deploy and maintain a LDH. LDH would be able
to host personal sensitive data that may not be openly shared but can be made discoverable and accessible
for research and public health under proper legal and ethical frameworks. The Pathogen Analysis System (PAS)
will be extended with additional workflows from selected use cases spanning global sewage data, foodborne
viruses and linked clinical-epidemiological data. PDN will enable its users to run analyses centrally for DH, and
locally or remotely for LDHs. An extensive and global support, outreach and training program will fuel the
adoption of the network concept, the connection of infrastructure to its interfaces, and the use of open pathogen
data by the global scientific community - both for research and for decision-making. In summary, PDN will
develop the networks and all the underpinning components at the technical-, analytical-, trust-, policy-, training-
and outreach-levels to truly enable data mobilization and sharing, and the subsequent data integration and
linking into a global knowledgebase network serving research needs thanks to open access to data, and public
health needs, including preparedness and response, thanks to timely access to controlled-access data and a
dedicated surveillance and outbreak dashboard."
10915927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a significant public health problem, affecting nearly 40 million Americans.
We have made the exciting discovery that NIHL may be linked to the unfolded protein response (UPR), a critical
early response mechanism to cellular stress that has downstream effectors that can promote both cell survival
and apoptosis. In support of this, we have additionally identified and characterized a novel deafness gene in
mice, Tmtc4, which has also been recently identified as a potential deafness gene in a human family. Mice in
which Tmtc4 is genetically absent (Tmtc4 knockout (KO) mice) hear normally at the onset of hearing but rapidly
become deaf within 2 weeks and have markedly increased susceptibility to NIHL. We have found that Tmtc4 is
broadly expressed in cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, both of which degenerate over time in Tmtc4 KO
mice. We have shown that Tmtc4 is part of a macromolecular complex involved in clearing calcium (Ca2+) from
the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that cochlear cells from Tmtc4 KO mice have
impairments in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and dynamics. This impairment in Ca2+ management leads to
upregulation of the UPR and cell death in the Tmtc4 KO cochlea. In parallel with this genetic deafness model of
UPR dysregulation, we have found that NIHL in wild-type (WT) mice results in UPR upregulation within 2 hours
of noise exposure; this hearing loss could be prevented in part by treatment with one drug, ISRIB, that specifically
targets the UPR, or a second drug, CDN1163, that facilitates Ca2+ reuptake into the ER. These preliminary
findings strongly implicate the UPR as an early mediator of cellular stress in the cochlea, upstream of other
previously studied apoptotic mechanisms, and thus is a potential therapeutic target for a wide range of acquired
and genetic forms of hearing loss.
 In this proposal, our specific aims are to investigate 1) how, in cell lines, TMTC4 dysfunction, including
human variants associated with hearing loss, affect ER Ca2+ flux and, subsequently, UPR activation; 2) how, in
the cochlea, noise-induced trauma in the form of hair-cell tip-link disruption and ER Ca2+ depletion activate the
UPR to induce hair-cell loss; and 3) how, in in vivo models of hearing loss, the UPR is modulated to give rise to
different patterns of hearing loss and hair-cell death. These Aims will be achieved using a multidisciplinary set
of physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic, and genetic techniques including ER Ca2+ imaging, mRNA
transcriptional analysis, and genetic TMTC4 conditional knockout mice. Through these experiments, we will gain

Dysregulation of gene networks during development can lead to organ malformation, dysfunction and disease,
especially neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, a more
comprehensive understanding of the gene regulatory networks that are active during development of the
central nervous system are needed to better understand disease etiology and treatment. The long-term goal of
this proposal is to define the role of the microRNA miR-9-2 in brain development, function and disease utilizing
in vivo knock-out mouse models. My preliminary data show that loss of miR-9-2 during development results in
severely malformed forebrains in mice in a gene dose-dependent manner. Based on this and previous studies,
I hypothesize that miR-9-2 is a critical regulator of gene networks that instruct neural progenitor proliferation,
differentiation and survival. Here, using a combination of transcriptomic, genomic and histological methods, I
will uncover the genes, genomic regulatory elements and cellular processes regulated by miR-9-2 during brain
development to define the specific role of this important microRNA. Additionally, I will uncover upstream
regulators of miR-9-2 expression by investigating the role of a deeply conserved cis-regulatory element, or
enhancer in modulating miR-9-2 expression during development. The proposed research is significant because
it will provide a comprehensive understanding of the gene networks, cell populations, and brain structures
under miR-9-2 regulation, give insight into the regulation of miR-9-2 expression and inform on the
consequences of miR-9-2 dysregulation that lead to neurological disease."

10915699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a ventricular tachycardia associated with prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc)
interval, and which may be caused by > 150 widely used drugs. TdP results in catastrophic outcomes,
including sudden cardiac death. Older age is a risk factor for drug-induced TdP, possibly due to declining
serum progesterone and testosterone concentrations in postmenopausal women and men, respectively. The
ECG biomarkers J-Tpeak and Tpeak-Tend, represent early and late repolarization, respectively, as well as
dispersion of repolarization (Tpeak-Tend). Preclinical evidence and preliminary data from our group indicate that
progesterone and testosterone exert protective effects against drug-induced prolongation of ventricular
repolarization. Effective means of reducing the risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and TdP in high
risk populations requiring therapy with QTc-prolonging drugs have not been identified, and the effects of sex
hormones on early vs late ventricular repolarization and dispersion of repolarization are unknown. The
objectives of this research are to evaluate novel therapeutic approaches to attenuate drug-induced QTc
lengthening. Our central hypothesis is that drug-induced QTc lengthening is attenuated by administration of
oral progesterone and transdermal testosterone. Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of oral progesterone as
a preventive method to attenuate drug-induced QTc interval lengthening in postmenopausal women. Specific
Aim 2: Determine the influence of oral progesterone on drug-induced lengthening of early and late ventricular
repolarization in postmenopausal women. Specific Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of transdermal testosterone
as a preventive method to attenuate drug-induced QTc interval lengthening in men ≥ 65 years of age. Specific
Aim 4: Determine the influence of transdermal testosterone on drug-induced lengthening of early and late
ventricular repolarization in men ≥ 65 years of age. Specific Aims 1&2 will be achieved via a prospective,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-way crossover study in postmenopausal women age ≥ 50
years (n=48). Each subject will take oral progesterone 400 mg or matching placebo daily for 7 days (≥ 14-day
washout period between phases). On day 7, each subject will receive a single dose of the QTc-lengthening
drug ibutilide 0.003 mg/kg. Specific Aims 3&4 will be achieved via a prospective, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled two-way crossover study in men ≥ 65 years of age (n=35). Each subject will apply
transdermal testosterone 1% 100 mg or transdermal placebo once daily for 3 days (≥ 7-day washout period
between phases). On day 7, each subject will ibutilide 0.003 mg/kg. In both studies, post-ibutilide QT, J-Tpeak
and Tpeak-Tend intervals and serum ibutilide concentrations will be determined serially. Primary outcome
measures: 1) Maximum post-ibutilide QTc intervals, 2) Maximum post-ibutilide % change in QTc intervals, 3)
Area under the QTc interval-time curves, and 4) J-Tpeak and Tpeak-Tend intervals. This research will identify
effective approaches for reducing the risk of drug-induced QTc interval prolongation in high-risk patients."

Aortic stiffness increases markedly with age and is associated with hypertension, heart failure (HF) and
accelerated brain aging. Abnormal hemodynamic coupling between left ventricle and aorta contributes to
pathogenesis of target organ damage, particularly HF. Hispanics/Latinos have a higher incidence of HF
compared to non-Hispanic Whites and present younger with HF with more co-morbidities and a lower left
ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Furthermore, the community-based Echocardiographic Study of Latinos
(ECHO-SOL [ES]; R01 PI: Rodriguez) has found that compared to published estimates in non-Hispanic
Whites, Hispanics have a higher HF risk factor burden, worse diastolic function and LV stiffness thus signaling
Hispanics at high risk for HF with preserved EF (HFpEF). ECHO-SOL 2 (ES2) (PI: Rodriguez) obtained serial
echos showing significantly worsening of echo parameters over an average of 4.3 years of follow-up.
Mechanism(s) for the susceptibility of Hispanics to HF are not well-accounted for by standard HF risk factors.
We hypothesize that vascular function and ventricular-arterial coupling significantly contributes to HF
pathogenesis and HF risk in Hispanics. Because the heart and vasculature are intimately coupled, LV stroke
volume depends on the important interaction of myocardial contractility with loading conditions from arterial
system compliance. There has been no study of comprehensive vascular function and ventricular-
arterial coupling assessment concomitant with a detailed echocardiographic exam in Hispanics. Thus,
we propose leveraging the resources of HCHS/SOL, ES and ES2 with longitudinal data on cardiac
phenotyping as well as clinical, sociocultural, and psychosocial risk factors to comprehensively characterize
vascular function in ES participants focusing on key primary pressure-flow phenotypes: carotid-femoral pulse
wave velocity, central pulse pressure, characteristic impedance and endothelial function [flow mediated
dilatation / hyperemic brachial flow velocities] concomitant with a detailed echocardiographic assessment
including 2D, color, spectral / tissue Doppler and speckle tracking.
Our application is focused on vascular dysfunction and its interaction / effects on the heart. Impaired
mechanical coupling contributes to combination of right and left heart abnormalities limits cardiac output and
contributes to the stage B HF (now termed pre-HF) to symptomatic HF, particularly HFpEF. Our goal is to
comprehensively describe vascular function pressure-flow relations and its determinants in Hispanics/Latinos.
(Aim 1) Then, determine how vascular function relates to cardiac structural and functional abnormalities
(including myocardial strain) to test the hypothesis that aortic stiffness impairs mechanical coupling. (Aim 2)
Because obtaining an echo exam is a natural component of our primary focus, we will have the benefit of
leveraging ~12 years of existing ES and ES2 longitudinal data to identify cardiac trajectories, assess the
determinants of each trajectories and the independent association with outcomes such as vascular
phenotypes overall mortality and HF. (Aim 3) Lastly, we will link our dataset with other NIH-funded cohorts
with existing vascular function data to perform pooled cohort analyses of vascular function of Hispanics/Latinos
with non-Hispanic whites and blacks from the Framingham Heart Study and Jackson Heart Study respectively,
to identify and address vascular disparities among racial-ethnic minorities. (Aim 4)
Our large-scale study represents an innovative and cost-effective (leveraging existing resources) approach to
advancing our understanding of the ventricular-vascular interaction on HF progression in an underrepresented
and vulnerable population. Identification of Hispanics with pre-HF and abnormal vascular function may help to
differentiate those who are at the highest risk for progression to HF, particularly HFpEF. Our proposed study
will provide the largest comprehensive dataset of vascular function (pressure-flow) parameters with
concomitant cardiac measures among Hispanics/Latinos in the US. Our proposed study will improve our
conceptual framework of HF pathogenesis and HF risk in Hispanics and serve to facilitate the screening and
identification of those at greatest risk, to lower the burden of clinical HF in this vulnerable population."
10914536,"Project Summary
We are developing the first orally available immunotherapy product, HPX-612, for the treatment of visceral
leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania and transmitted by sandflies. Visceral leishmaniasis
remains endemic in 65 countries worldwide, with over 4 million people impacted globally. Current treatment
options require lengthy and painful injections and have significant limitations including low therapeutic index,
severe side effects, acute cytotoxicity, high associated hospital costs and emergence of their resistance strains.
Additionally, these treatments are often inaccessible to those living in the remote areas where Leishmania is
prevalent. Leishmania infection is heavily dependent on host monocytes and macrophages as once the parasite
enters the human body, it is engulfed by monocytes and macrophages where it inhibits macrophage activation
and replicates. Recent studies have identified the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein
2 (NOD2) as a critical regulator in the intracellular killing of Leishmania parasites. Further, NOD2 agonism in
infected monocytes and macrophages provide a novel host-targeted therapeutic strategy that increases
immunosurveillance via activation of the innate immune system that resolves leishmaniasis.
HPX-612 is a novel lipid nanoparticle and potent innate immune stimulator that is comprised of the active
pharmaceutical ingredient muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE), a NOD2 agonist with
demonstrated clinical safety. MTP-PE is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the EMA-approved intravenously
delivered MepactÒ for non-metastatic osteosarcoma. HPX-612 has a demonstrated capacity to cross the gut-
blood barrier creating a sustained NOD2 stimulation and potent pro-inflammatory conversion of monocytes and
macrophages after oral dosing. When approved, HPX-612 will be delivered external to hospital settings and over
longer time periods to efficiently combat visceral leishmaniasis in regions that need it most. Herein this
application we will evaluate the preclinical pharmacokinetic profile of HPX-612, optimal posology, and
confirmation of efficacy in a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis. These results will support the launch of
HPX-612 into full-scale preclinical development for the treatment of leishmaniasis and a future Phase II
application."
10914546,"Abstract
Approximately 30% of hepatitis C virus-infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within six months. The
remaining 70% develop chronic infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from
15% to 30% within 20 years. The viral and immune correlates of these different outcomes of infection and
pathogenesis remain poorly studied, mainly due to the lack of an informative animal model. We developed
surrogate animal models for HCV using a rodent HCV-like virus isolated from feral brown rats (Rattus
norvegicus), RHV-rn1 (Rn-1). So far, studies of Rn-1 infection and immunity in lab mice have revealed that
normal immunocompetent mice do not develop prolonged or chronic HCV-like infections. Notably, chronic HCV
and RHV infections can be studied in their natural host, humans and rats, respectively. However, how HCV
evades immunity during the acute phase, a prerequisite for developing chronic infection, requires animal models
that allow comparative analyses of HCV-like clearance and persistence and mechanistic analysis of innate and
adaptive immune responses. To create such models, we isolated several new RHV variants from feral rats and
used these as a pool for serial passaging and adaptation in mice. After several passages, we identified a mouse-
adapted variant (Rn-2m) that produced delayed clearance or chronic infection in normal lab mice. Subsequently,
we identified the parent rat virus Rn-2, and its infection cleared within 3-4 weeks in mice. The project seeks to
identify the viral and immune determinants of heterogenous outcomes of HCV infection and pathogenesis.
Considering the strengths and weaknesses of the rat and mouse models, we propose a comparative biology
approach where the new Rn-2m infection in the mouse model, due to the availability of vast resources, will be
used to develop and test hypotheses, and the rat model will be used for validation of key findings. Specific Aim
1 is to identify the viral correlates of spontaneous clearance and chronic infection. Our new data indicate that
Rn-2m constantly evolves and modulates innate immune cells in the liver of infected mice to establish a
prolonged or chronic infection. We will compare the nature of infection, evolution, and immunogenicity of clone-
rescued Rn-2 and Rn-2m to identify viral correlates of acute clearance, delayed clearance, and chronic infection
in mice and subsequently in rats. Specific Aim 2 is to identify the immune correlates of chronic infection and liver
diseases. We will use RHV-specific mouse and rat MHC tetramers and E2 protein tetramers, ex vivo antigen
stimulation, passive antibody, and in vivo T and B cell transfer, and cell depletion experiments to define the role
of T and B cells in determining different outcomes of RHV infection and pathogenesis. We expect that the solid
rationale behind our approach will yield a biologically relevant and widely accessible lab mouse model for HCV
and gain novel and mechanistic insights into HCV immune evasion and pathogenesis. This knowledge is crucial
for developing new strategies to prevent chronic HCV infections and associated liver diseases."
10916545,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The nationwide opioid epidemic includes women of child birthing age accounting for a dramatically
increased number of infants being born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). Currently there
is no uniformly accepted treatment strategy for NOWS and the choice of primary medication, criteria for
treatment, and dosing/weaning schedules vary between centers. Morphine is by far the most commonly
used medication for NOWS treatment, followed by methadone. Buprenorphine is a promising drug but with
limited studied in this patient population. Additionally, the screening tools used to diagnose NOWS and the
appropriate threshold to initiate drug therapy have not been conclusively evaluated. When historical
empirically derived drug treatment and weaning protocols have been modified and standardized, reductions
of length of stay have been observed. Additionally, nonpharmalogical methods appear to be successful in
reducing the symptoms of NOWS. In this application we present preliminary data of a pilot randomized
controlled trial currently in progress in our nursery. It includes identifying infants with severe symptoms of
NOWS via modified Finnegan scoring, then randomizing them to a standard morphine dosing/weaning
schedule, or to an optimal morphine dosing strategy. The optimal morphine dosing strategy does not
provide a scheduled dose of morphine, but only provides a dose of morphine when the withdrawal
symptoms cannot be satiated through nonpharmacological means. Both study groups received all optimized
nonpharmacological methods available to them. In the optimal morphine arm, we observed a large
reduction in the use of morphine and in the duration of days receiving pharmacologic therapy. We speculate
that the use of the optimal morphine dosing strategy limited the use of pharmacologic treatment to only
times when nonpharmacologic interventions were not sufficient. This essentially provided the mother or
other care givers time to recognize and adapt to the infant's withdrawal behaviors, enabling them to
extinguish them via nonpharmacological means. The optimal morphine dosing strategy also prevented the
infant's withdrawal from becoming too symptomatic by allowing morphine to be used when needed, yet not
committing the infant to a prolonged scheduled course of morphine treatment and weaning when
nonpharmacological measures could have sufficed. Thus, we favor a clinical trial that emphasizes the use
of nonpharmacological methods to control withdrawal symptoms irrespective of the drug arm the infant is
assigned. However, we favor including a more novel optimal dosing strategy arm rather than limiting the
investigation to standard scheduled dosing/weaning arms."

10917158,"The mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems are
continually exposed to the exterior environment. In health, the continual clearance of a luminal
mucus layer in these organ systems represents a key component of innate defense against
disease. However, in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF), abnormal mucus clearance represents a
key contributor to disease pathogenesis. Over the last decade, our studies have revealed that
CFTR dysfunction in pwCF leads to epithelial surface layer volume depletion and, thus,
“dehydration” of the overlying mucus layer. This increased mucus concentration, coupled with
disease-related mucin overproduction, results in mucus adhesion to epithelial surfaces and
mucostasis. It is likely that adhesion of the mucus to the epithelial surface represents an initiating
event in the pathogenesis of the CF in both the lung and gut. Static mucus constitutes the nidus
for the persistent bacterial infection that provokes an ineffective inflammatory response in the
airways and likely small intestine (i.e., small bowel overgrowth). Given the importance of
understanding the role that mucus and mucins play in CF pathogenesis in both the GI system and
lungs, the goal of the Mucus Biochemical and Biophysical Core (Core D) is to provide both internal
and external researchers access to a unique spectrum of tools and reagents necessary for
understanding the biochemical and biophysical properties of mucus/mucins in health and pwCF.
To this end, Core D laboratories offer a series of novel techniques developed to directly measure
key mucus biochemical and biophysical properties, including mucin concentration, osmotic
pressure, adhesion strength, cell surface frictional interactions, and viscous and elastic moduli.
Collectively, these measurements will facilitate an understanding of how abnormal mucus in CF
produces adherent, static, mucus and to identify optimal combinations of pharmacological
agent(s) to restore/accelerate the rate of mucus transport in people with CF. The main goal of the
UNC Mucus Biochemistry and Biophysics Core is to provide investigators data from these
specialized mucus/mucin assays that are either not possible or feasible in their labs. Core D is
uniquely positioned to: 1) investigate the properties of user supplied mucus samples; and 2)
assess the impact of therapeutic agents, supplied by investigators, to reduce mucus accumulation
and accelerate mucus clearance. A strength of this Core is the collaboration of a group of
scientists who are experts in the field of mucus/mucin analysis. The benefit to potential Core users
is the ability to generate data utilizing our novel techniques, freeing individual investigators to
focus on basic science, and drug development."

Multi-Scale Multi-Modality High Resolution Mapping of the Adult Human Lung
 Maintaining normal lung function and inducing repair of damaged lung can be markedly improved if we better
understand the cellular and molecular complexities of the organ. Technical and analytical advances now make
it possible to gain detailed access to previously hidden fundamentals of lung biology by generating high
resolution, single cell and subcellular, biomolecular maps coalesced into an atlas of the human respiratory
system. It is the goal of HuBMAP and specifically of this Lung TMC to generate interactive, searchable, cell type
and subtype annotated maps and tabular data representing transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and select
posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of healthy lung. Ultimate deliverable will be integration of these maps into
a reference atlas of healthy lung to which diseased lung can be compared. Such a biomolecular atlas with multi-
scale, 3D spatial resolution will be truly transformative for human pulmonary biology with ramifications also for
understanding the immune and vascular systems throughout the body. Building upon our successful HuBMAP
Phase 1 engagement, our tissue mapping strategy brings multiple strengths including 1) an established, robust,
tissue biorepository, 2) well oriented tissue samples representing the entire human lung with focus on regions of
interest, 3) snRNAseq/ATACseq dual-omic sequencing and mass spectroscopy based bulk metabolomics to
provide basis for deconvolution of, 4) novel spatial transcriptomic methods, 5) spatial highly-multiplexed chemical
and immunofluorescent microscopy, 5) a suite of unbiased mass spectrometry, stimulated Raman spectroscopy
and advanced microscopy technologies, all combined in such a way to enable spatially resolved co-localized 2D
and 3D mapping of gene expression, metabolites, lipids, proteins, and protein modifications across lung tissues
with single-cell or near single-cell resolution. We will include assays on 40 diverse donor lungs creating tissue
microarrays to enhance assay throughput. We envision achieving an unprecedented level of biomolecular
mapping of the trachea, extra and intra-pulmonary bronchi with bronchial artery and lymphatic systems, several
levels of bronchioles with focus on broncho-vascular bundles and terminal-respiratory-alveolar duct transition
regions as well as alveolar and pleural regions. Working with the HuBMAP HIVE and our DAC, our achievable
goal will be, by microdissection, serial section reconstruction and 3D imaging of thick sections, a Multi-Scale
Multimodality High Resolution 3-D and Tabular Atlas of the Adult Human Lung."

The proposed Center for Lupus Research will take advantage of a wide range of technologies that will be applied
to monitor molecular pathways driving disease activity in patients toward the ultimate goal of a personalized
approach to therapy. Cumulative efforts from this project will generate an invaluable sample repository as a
resource both for the proposed studies and future experimental questions. Thus, the necessary and important
mission of the Clinical Core is to ensure that all patients will have a comprehensive clinical assessment and that
patient samples and clinical data will be systematically catalogued and tracked, adequately stored, and
appropriately disseminated.
This Core will arise from the Divisions of Pediatric Rheumatology at Children’s Health at UT Southwestern
Medical Center (UTSW) and Nationwide Children’s Hospital at Ohio University (NCH) and take advantage of the
availability of samples from well-characterized pediatric SLE patients, who manifest disease early in life, often
present extreme phenotypes and lack co-morbidities that confound the phenotypes. Blood samples obtained via
this Clinical Component will serve as the source of pediatric patient samples for the entire proposed Center for
Lupus Research.
The Clinical Core will build upon existing strengths and expand to coordinate sample and data acquisition,
processing, storage, and distribution for this P50 grant proposal. The Core will capitalize on the long-standing
collaboration between Drs. Pascual and Wright and extend the collaboration to Dr. Ardoin in order to expand the
Core’s capabilities and the outstanding organization developed to liaise the clinic and the research laboratory.

10917176,"SLE is clinically complex and molecularly heterogeneous. While monogenic cases are identified, a
complex genetic background involving mutations in regulatory regions plus environmental factors are at the core
of the more common, sporadic SLE cases. Project 1 builds upon our long-term approaches to address critical
gaps in understanding SLE molecular heterogeneity, which might contribute to phase 3 clinical trial failures.
During the previous cycle of this CORT, we used PBMC bulk and single cell transcriptional and epigenetic studies
to further understand the origin and composition of the major SLE blood signatures. These studies revealed that
i) the IFN signature is restricted to a few major cellular clusters and minor subclusters within PBMCs, ii) unique
subsets of myeloid cells co-express IFN-Stimulated Genes (ISGs) and IL-1, and iii) the expression of monogenic
lupus-related genes preferentially maps to DCs and B cells/Plasmablasts. In addition, we confirmed that
transcriptional signals associated to the erythroid lineage represent a biomarker of DA in a subset of pediatric
SLE patients. To ascertain the involvement of erythroid cells in SLE pathogenesis, we have now developed in
vitro systems that recapitulate human erythropoiesis starting with PBMCs. These studies have unraveled a novel
pathogenic loop involving mature red blood cells that retain mitochondria (Mito+ RBCs), opsonizing anti-RBCs
autoantibodies and myeloid cell activation in SLE.
 We now propose to further develop these studies in order to decode both i) upstream signals and ii)
downstream events related with the presence of Mito+ RBCs with the ultimate goal of identify novel targets for
therapy and/or DA biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will identify the ultimate upstream mechanisms leading to
mitochondrial removal during healthy erythropoiesis and how these mechanisms become dysfunctional in
erythroid progenitors from SLE patients. As part of this Aim, we will also follow the presence of Mito+ RBCs and
the upstream dysfunctional pathways that give rise to them in pediatric and adult SLE patients during flares and
remissions, and will establish their correlation with SLE molecular subgroups, anti-RBCs autoantibodies and
other auto-specificities as well as clinical phenotypes. Our data support that Mito+ RBCs contribute to both, IFN
and inflammasome activation upon opsonization and internalization within myeloid cells. In Aim 2, we will dissect
the downstream pro-inflammatory pathways induced by Mito+ RBCs in PBMCs and in selected purified cell
populations, especially professional phagocytes. This project will benefit from our well-characterized pediatric
cohort, resources developed through the past 15 years to study the human immune system, and an exclusive
group of collaborators and advisors complementing our expertise. Successful completion of Project 1 will i)
elucidate upstream alterations leading to a unique SLE erythroid lineage dysfunction, ii) unravel novel pathways
contributing to myeloid inflammation and IFN production in SLE and ultimately iii) identify novel biomarkers

and assistance. The Innovator Core (IC) will be responsible for providing this oversight, monitoring progress
towards milestones, assisting with unexpected delays, and reducing or recommending to NIH to discontinue
funding when it becomes clear that a project will not meet the expected outcomes. The NeuroTech Harbor (NTH)
IC will provide close mentorship to funded teams during the tenure of the subproject, as well as oversee progress
with project management tools, to successfully deliver first in human prototypes.
 The IC begins interacting with and managing a subproject once funding approval for that subproject is
received. All subproject PIs will have a single point of contact in the NTH for all issues through the IC. At this
point, the project milestones, timeline, and deliverables will have been defined. An assessment of the
technology's stage of development will be available after the Deep Dive analysis (Evaluation Core (EC)),
identifying the critical areas of assistance necessary to achieve a prototype that is ready for first-in-human
studies. Additional resources will also have been allocated. The crucial steps moving forward will be to work with
the Innovators to develop and document a project management plan for the duration of the subproject and
oversee its progress and that of the resources allocated to the subproject. Specifically, the IC will accomplish
these goals with the followings aims: (OC Aim 1) To maximize subproject success, the Innovator Core will work
closely with Innovators to monitor the progress of the subproject and any associated resources. (OC Aim 2) To
mitigate the risk of failure, the Innovator Core, in collaboration with the Evaluation Core and the Steering
Committee, will address any issues that could interfere with reaching identified milestones. (OC Aim 3) To
continue to encourage Innovators to consider the principles of universal design throughout development to
increase population served.
 The IC will identify a Dream Tech Team for each subproject which includes a project facilitator, as the single
point of contact to NTH, a clinical advisor, commercialization advisor, steering committee mentor, and a project
manager (PM) tool Trainer. The project facilitator will work with the subproject PI, using industry-standard project
management tools, to document milestones, deliverables, and timelines (MD&T) for both the subproject and
collaborate with the Resource Core (RC) to similarly document MD&T for funded Resources. The Dream Tech
Teams will meet with Innovators at least monthly to monitor progress and identify any issues that might interfere
with progress. In line with our Equitech approach, we expect to recruit URM participants to the Dream Tech

mentoring program is based on the establishment and optimal functioning of a Multidisciplinary Mentoring
Committee led by a senior investigator with the scientific expertise and commitment to developing the next
generation of translational breast cancer researchers. The Multidisciplinary Mentoring Committee will be
composed of the primary mentor and the complementary clinical and/or basic investigator necessary for a
comprehensive mentoring program plus a statistician. It is viewed as crucial to the success of the awardee that
the mentoring be ongoing and robust. This will be accomplished by close oversight by the Director of the CEP
of the mentoring process and progress of the awardee. Dr. Goetz, the Director of the CEP and SPORE Director,
will report to the SPORE Executive Committee. This intensive oversight process was established because of the
firm conviction of the SPORE Director that the development of independent investigators and translational breast
cancer research is central to the SPORE mission. The explicit expectation is that the awardees will utilize the
resources made available to them for the development of independent research programs and acquisition of
independent funding in breast cancer research. We are requesting $50,000 per year (direct costs) to support
this program. This will be supplemented by $50,000 (direct costs) of Mayo Clinic Cancer Center support. One
award of $100,000 per year will be made, which can be used for salary, technician support, and supplies. One
awardee will be supported per year and a given awardee can be supported for up to two years providing
satisfactory progress is demonstrated. To date the CEP has been successful in that of the 10 awardees, five
have successfully competed to become either SPORE Project Co-Leaders in full Projects or Co-Directors of
Cores. Additionally, half have been women (three) or minority (two). Further, of the 3 women, 2 have been
promoted into leadership positions in the SPORE including Core B Co-Director and Core C Co-Director."
10919819,"PROJECT SUMMARY RESOURCE CORE
 Neurotech Harbor's (NTH) Resource Core (RC) will accelerate and improve the chance of success of funded
subprojects by working with all the other Cores in identifying, soliciting, evaluating, and managing Resources to
produce a human-grade prototype. We will implement a 6-step process for each subproject that will move forward
to NIH: (i) The Deep-Dive panel in the Evaluation Core (EC) will identify required resources and provide a list to
the RC. (ii) The RC will identify a list of targeted providers within the Resource Network and give this list to the
Outreach Core (OC). (iii) The OC will generate solicitations for each required resource and send these to the
targeted providers, nationwide providers, and other BP hubs to share with their resource networks. The
solicitations will encourage minority-owned and/or employed businesses to apply. (iv) Providers will submit their
bids to the EC, who will select the most appropriate resource providers for the proposal package. (v)The proposal
package, which includes the subproject proposal and proposal for the resource subaward, will be sent to the NIH
by the Administrative Core. (vi) Funded Subprojects will be managed by the Innovator Core (IC) and the
contracted resources will be managed by the RC.
 The Proposal Package submitted to NIH will identify the Resources and funding needed in conjunction with
the Innovators' projects. Once funded, the RC will be responsible for managing the performance and deliverables
for the Resources. Using the milestones, deliverables, and timelines identified in the Proposal Package and
industry-standard project management tools, the RC will create a formal plan to manage and document the
progress of each subaward and ensure success.
 For this process to be successful, and to match all subprojects with the resources that they require, the RC
must continue to grow its Resource Network and ensure proper management of the engagements between
contracted providers and subproject teams. The RC will accomplish this through the following aims: (Aim 1) To
manage Resource Subawards and ensure successful delivery of resources and services to Innovator subproject
teams. (Aim 2) To develop and expand the Resource Network such that providers with diverse services and
facilities can be readily targeted for required subprojects. (Aim 3) To expand the Resource Network such that
women- or URM-owned providers are encouraged to participate.
 To ensure that solicitations for services will be answered in a timely manner consistent with the accelerated
review cycle expected from BP Hubs, the RC will have prequalified Resource providers, and created the support
documents allowing evaluation of resource subaward proposals by the EC. These documents will help providers
turn our solicitations around quickly. Finally, we will work with our (OC) partners to reach women- and URM-
owned and/or employed resource providers and encourage them to participate."
10919821,"Abstract: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core is the central element of the proposed hub and responsible for leadership,
management, and oversight of the other Cores with input from the Steering Committee. CIMIT has extensive
experience in setting up Administrative Cores in its previous work as the Point-of-Care Technology Research
Center in Primary Care, as the Coordinating Center for POCTRN, and as the primary architect for the
administrative structure for RADx Tech. The Administrative Core will provide governance, set policy, and
continuously improve the efficiency of CINTA based on feedback from the Steering Committee, real time
metrics, and achievement of benchmarks. The Steering Committee will be part of the Administrative Core and
charged with providing CINTA leadership with strategic oversight and recommendations for accelerating
commercial translation and clinical impact. The CINTA Coordination Team within the Administrative Core,
composed of the PI, Co-PI, and Core leads, will work closely with the Steering Committee to make all major
decisions. Dr. Schachter has drawn on his career-long interests in neurology, technology, and patient
advocacy to receive commitments from national leaders to join the Steering Committee, who reflect a diverse
range of expertise corresponding to areas of interest of the NIH Participating Organizations, as well as relevant
life experiences and work with disadvantaged communities. To create a patient-centered focus for CINTA, the
Administrative Core will create a Consumer Advisory Board within the Administrative Core to convey the voice
of the patient to CINTA. The Administrative Core will work with the Outreach Core to develop and implement
clinical needs assessments in advance of each solicitation to identify unmet needs in nervous system disorders
where technology-based solutions would have the highest impact. Utilizing the information gleaned from the
needs assessments. The Administrative Core will then create, post, and disseminate a solicitation. CINTA will
leverage CIMIT’s extensive experience with solicitations and subproject support to identify the most promising
technologies and provide milestone-driven funding, resources, and relevant expertise to assist innovators in
rapidly moving technologies to human-grade prototypes. To support these processes and roles, CIMIT created
and has continuously improved and utilized, a secure, web-based infrastructure to enable efficient and
effective operations. This infrastructure consists of: 1) the CoLab platform, which is used to manage
solicitations, and specifically the flow of applications through the multi-stage, interactive project selection
process, and 2) the GAITS platform, which helps project teams successfully navigate and accelerate the
challenging journey of innovation in healthcare. CINTA will follow all applicable NIH guidelines and will abide
by NIH standards for confidentiality, conflict of interest, and data security. CINTA is committed to embedding
principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, as represented by Steering Committee membership, the CINTA
Coordination Team, as well as the voice of the patient, into the work of the Administrative Core."
10919823,"Abstract - OUTREACH CORE
The Outreach Core will be the public face and communications center for CINTA. Under the direction of the
CINTA Coordination Team and the Steering Committee, and with logistical support from the Administrative
Core, the Outreach Core is responsible for broad outreach to a diverse community of stakeholders using a
variety of methods including needs assessments, solicitation announcements, news and education, research
dissemination, and collaboration with the other funded hubs. Capturing and amplifying the voices of patients,
caregivers, and diverse, underrepresented communities will be a central guiding principle. CIMIT has decades
of experience in translational research and multidisciplinary collaboration. Since its founding in 1998, CIMIT
has supported nearly 800 innovative projects, including annual needs assessments, issuance of solicitations,
customized innovator support, and targeted dissemination of relevant information. The proposed CINTA
Outreach Core will build upon the experience and lessons learned from supporting these NIH programs and
will add further process innovations. CINTA will conduct annual needs assessments and stakeholder outreach
to support the areas of interests of the NIH Participating Organizations. Strategies for conducting annual needs
assessments will be based on input from the Steering Committee and Consumer Advisory Board. These
panels have been constituted to broadly reflect the areas of emphasis of the NIH Participating Organizations.
CINTA will use methods that CIMIT has employed in past years and will also broadly engage stakeholders by
use of social media and Zoom focus groups for identifying unmet needs for disorders of the nervous system.
These sessions will include the perspectives of patient advocates, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations,
professional societies, the academic research community, industry, payers, and others. Results of annual
needs assessments will be presented to CINTA leadership to develop appropriate criteria for performance
specifications where technology-based solutions would have the highest impact to address identified unmet
needs. Specifications will be included in the solicitation and will be used as review criteria by the Evaluation
Core. The Outreach Core will augment efforts by Mentor Teams, consultants, and subject matter experts to
train funded teams, including conducting an “Investor Forum” to connect subproject teams with potential
investors. CINTA will collaborate with other hubs to plan annual meetings and publications for sharing
outcomes and lessons learned. CINTA will facilitate communications among funded hubs and internal
dissemination of outcomes and lessons learned. If desired, CINTA will be pleased to construct and maintain a
Blueprint MedTech: Incubator Hubs program-specific website to be shared among the other hubs. Creating a
public narrative for both the Blueprint MedTech: Incubator Hubs program and for awardees is critical to
success. Press releases for program launch can be developed and disseminated through email, social media,
and, optionally, via a press wire service or press list."
10909889,"Project Summary
The objective of the ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) project is to develop a foundational,
functional map of protein-RNA interactions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) encoded in the human genome,
and the RNA elements they bind to across the transcriptome. These RNA elements, when expressed, form
the basis of co- and post-transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and
integrating a physical map of 400 new RBPs in two diﬀerent human cell lines with transcriptome-wide
measurements of the eﬀects of depleting these RBPs. Over the past 9 years, our group has established highly
eﬃcient data production workﬂows of experimental methods that will enable us to immediately expand these
datasets further, which form a crucial and missing link to decipher the mechanisms of post-trancriptional
regulation and how these impact genetic variation and disease etiology. When combined with the data we
generated over the past 9 years, these eﬀorts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA
elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately
half of the known complement of human RBPs. ENCORE will continue developing and integrating a physical
map of hundreds of RBPs in two diﬀerent human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the
eﬀects of depleting these RBPs. In addition, we will provide training and outreach to establish ENCORE
annotations as the standard reference for co- and post-transcriptional research and clinical genomics eﬀorts
in the long-term. In summary, the data we will produce in this project will enable a more systematic and
comprehensive understanding of the role of RBPs and RNA biology in the contribution to human biology and
disease."
10911874,"Project Summary
It is well established that both acute and chronic exposure to PM significantly affects human health, causing 7 million
premature deaths worldwide. It is becoming increasingly evident that PM modifies respiratory host defense responses, which
would affect groups of all ages and could have significant implications for children with developing immune systems or
susceptible individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The host defense responses of the respiratory tract include
innate resident immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells, which provide the first line of defense
in the airways against invading pollutants or pathogens. Pollutant-induced modifications of either or both of these
components of respiratory host defense will have significant effects on the ability of the host airway to fight infections.
While epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between ambient PM exposure and enhanced
susceptibility to infection, a critical knowledge gap exists regarding the mechanistic link between PM-induced immune
dysfunction of epithelial cells and airway immune cells and in vivo evidence of respiratory immune health effects. The
objective of this proposal is to address how PM modifies cellular mechanisms that are integral to maintaining respiratory
immune function homeostasis and link these to observations made in humans in vivo. We hypothesize that PM samples
collected during high (vs low) air pollution periods in China will 1) suppress respiratory immune function when tested in
vitro (UNC), and 2) show similar deleterious effects when examined in vivo in exposed individuals in China (China
collaborators). SA 1 will determine the effects of PM from China on epithelial cell immune and antiviral host defense
function and identify the mechanisms mediating these responses. These studies will use our well-established system of
differentiated human nasal epithelial cells, which will be exposed to PM collected in China and examined for changes in
host defense function and bioenergetic modifications. SA 2 will determine PM-induced modifications of innate immune
cell phenotype and functions and the mechanisms mediating these responses. These studies will use sputum and
bronchoalveolar lavage macrophages acquired from healthy volunteers, and exposed to PM ex vivo, and examined for
changes in immune cell phenotype and function. The role of PM-induced changes in bioenergetics will also be examined.
The in vitro studies in SA1 and SA2 will be linked to human in vivo studies proposed in SA3. In SA3, one hundred volunteers
from Xinxiang Medical University will be personal air samplers and undergo collection of nasal mucosal samples and
induced sputum samples during high and low air pollution periods. Innate immune endpoints as described in SA1 and SA2
will be measured on the collected nasal and sputum samples in SA3.The data derived from these studies will yield important
mechanistic information on PM-induced health effects to support current epidemiological associations. Furthermore, these
data will address a clinical knowledge gap regarding global health implications for highly polluted and populated countries
around the world."
10911878,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost all cellular organisms employ an array of photoreceptors to detect their light environment. Arguably the most
influential are the phytochromes (Phys), a diverse group essential for plant development and the behavior of many bacterial,
fungal, and algal species. By reversible photointerconversion of their bilin (or open-chain tetrapyrrole) chromophores
between red light-absorbing Pr and far-red light-absorbing Pfr states, Phys act as photoswitches in various signaling
cascades responsive to light intensity, duration, direction, and spectral quality. Moreover, through the thermal reversion of
Pfr back to Pr, some Phys sense temperature through enthalpic effects on this reaction, and perceive photoperiod through
the nighttime depletion of Pfr. The cumulative effects of this Pr/Pfr interconversion impact numerous physiological
processes important to agriculture and the biology of harmful plant and human pathogens. In addition, their unique
photochemistries provide invaluable optogenetic tools, including novel fluorophores for tissue imaging, and engineered
photoswitches for regulating cellular events with remarkable temporal and spatial precision.
Recently, we made great strides in understanding how Phys signal, with emerging structures suggesting that microbial and
plant Phys use two distinct output modalities. Both start with light-triggered isomerization of the bilin, which drives a -
stranded to -helical rearrangement of a hairpin loop that links the signature PHY and GAF domains. While photoactivated
microbial Phys then connect torsional strain generated within the dimer to regulate an appended output domain (typically
with histidine kinase activity), plant Phys have rearranged their domain organization to create a photosensitive dimeric
platform that likely enables reversible binding and eventual degradation of the family of PIF transcriptional repressors.
While current models helped illuminate gross changes required for endstate conversion, the intermediates of photoexcitation
and ensuing structural changes necessary for creating a signaling-competent Pfr state remain uncertain.
The objectives of this proposal are to complete these pictures through continued X-ray crystallographic and cryo-electron
microscopic approaches followed by informed biochemical analyses of representatives in their inactive and active states.
Specific aims are to: (1) exploit time-resolved serial X-ray crystallography to structurally define the intermediates generated
by Phys after photon absorption; (2) generate more comprehensive structures of bacterial Phys, including models of full-
length dimeric photoreceptors with their signal output modules; (3) develop a model for how plant Phys signal through
structural studies on Pfr; (4) apply steady-state and time-resolved protein surface mapping to support the Phy
photoconversion pathway(s) seen structurally; (5) develop models of Phys interacting with their downstream effectors, and
(6) appreciate how diversity among plant Phy enables thermal/time perception by specific isoforms.
Taken together, this project will provide an essential framework to better appreciate the structure, allosteric mechanisms,
and evolution of the Phy superfamily. Understanding how microorganisms and plants sense light, temperature, and time
would then have important ramifications for improving the agricultural performance of crop plants, understanding microbial
ecosystems, controlling medically-relevant pathogens, and furthering the application of Phys as optogenetic reagents."
10912223,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Incarcerated individuals have higher rates of chronic disease than the general population, and disease
burden will likely increase as the prison population continues to age. Despite this, health care services in prison
primarily focus on infectious diseases, mental illness, and substance abuse, largely neglecting chronic physical
health conditions. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is an evidence-based program
developed to support self-management for people with chronic illnesses. At least 10 randomized trials conducted
in non-correctional settings have linked CDSMP to disease-related improvements and reduced healthcare
expenditures. CDSMP has been used in state corrections systems via 3 approaches: 1) bringing community
agency CDSMP leaders into the correctional setting to lead the program, 2) training correctional staff as program
leaders, and 3) training incarcerated individuals to serve as peer leaders. To date, however, there has been little
research into efficient and effective strategies for scaling up the intervention within state corrections systems
using any of these approaches. Scale-up (i.e. deliberate efforts to increase the impact of successfully tested
health innovations to benefit more people and promote sustainability) is an understudied concept in
implementation science, with few existing empirical studies that explicitly focus on the process of scale-up.
Assessing scalability, however, is crucial for ensuring sustainability of complex interventions within resource-
poor settings. The research objective of this K01 is to evaluate and maximize the scalability of CDSMP among
older adults in state correctional systems. Guided by the Scaling up Management Framework, we will use a
mixed methods research approach to query community agency leaders, staff, and incarcerated individuals about
ways to maximize the scalability of CDSMP within state correctional settings and develop and refine CDSMP
scale-up strategies for these settings. Our goal is to develop scale-up strategies to be evaluated in a subsequent
randomized implementation trial. The training objectives of this K01 will add expertise in implementation science
and justice-involved research to my existing knowledge base in biopsychosocial models of disease, social
gerontology, health disparities, quantitative analysis, and chronic disease management, to reach my goal of
becoming an independent researcher who uses implementation science approaches to improve health outcomes
among justice-involved populations. As the prison population continues to age, the burden of chronic disease
within correctional systems will continue to increase, which contributes to skyrocketing correctional costs.
Understanding how to expand evidence-based chronic disease programs within correctional systems is crucial
for reducing disease-related morbidity and mortality among incarcerated individuals and for reducing costs. This
line of research will identify and test scale-up strategies for chronic disease management in prisons."
10912253,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research to support older adults with serious illness is a public health priority. Defining and
monitoring serious and other adverse events [(S)AEs] in clinical trials involving older adults with
serious illness pose challenges to investigators, regulators, sponsor agency members, and
patient stakeholders. Challenges include the reporting of events that are: implausibly related to
the intervention, misaligned with patient values, and/or caused by already established, well-
known relationships. There are also challenges with data and safety monitoring board
education, oversight and communication. In 2020, the NIA sponsored an initiative to convene a
multi-disciplinary group that met four times over 12 months. Efforts of the convening resulted in
new framework anchored by six principles including: 1) Consider interventions, populations and
settings (e.g., whether the study is FDA-regulated and therefore must adhere to specific
reporting standards, or alternatively, whether there is investigator discretion as in socio-
behavioral trials); 2) Adhere to the importance of safety reporting but use aggregate and routine
over singular and expedited reporting for most (S)AEs; 3) Prioritize intervention relatedness
(i.e., whether the (S)AE is ‘unlikely,’ ‘possibly,’ or ‘probably’ related to the intervention
mechanism using existing tools to support unbiased causality identification); 4) Subsume
expectedness into relatedness determination; given difficulties in forecasting the full range of
(S)AEs in seriously ill older adults at a trial’s outset, expectedness should be ascertained when
events occur by “ruling out underlying disease states”; 5) Consider concordance with patients’
goals of care; and 6) Assess seriousness, marking the events regulatory bodies are most
concerned about (e.g., death, hospitalization, life threatening events), after relatedness and
goal-concordance to highlight (S)AEs of greatest concern, and report them in an expedited,
case-by-case manner. The current proposed project will reconvene a working group to initially
develop the details of the methodology for defining, classifying and reporting (S)AEs for clinical
trials involving older, seriously ill adults. The group will focus on better defining and tracking
interventions, populations, settings; elaborating upon the relatedness determination; further
developing how to meaningfully determine patient goal concordance with events; and develop
content to align these efforts with existing NIA and related tools and guidance. This effort will
involve the creation of publicly available tools to support the research community, and the
widespread dissemination of the framework to encourage its implementation within clinical trials."

Progress in understanding the effects of media exposure on child outcomes has been limited by the lack of
large and representative longitudinal datasets, the difficulty of tracking quality of content in an ever-changing
media environment, and the lack of a mechanism to rapidly share and analyze results in a theoretically driven
manner. The overarching goal of this P01 proposal is to examine trajectories of media use - characterizing the
context, content, and problematic uses of media - in a diverse group of 1200 children aged 1 to 7 years and
examining temporal associations with emotion regulation and social competence using a cohort sequential
design. The admin core will collate and integrate the Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure
(CAFE) Toolkit data along with emotion regulation and social competence outcome data across the three
studies. The CAFE Toolkit measures household media use through a web-based questionnaire, time-use
diary, and passive-sensing app installed on family mobile devices (Barr et al., 2020; Radesky et al., 2020b).
The administrative core will manage the data integration of the three longitudinal studies across the entire age
range (1-3, 3-5, 5-7 year olds). Data collected from new cohorts will be compared to data collected before and
during the COVID pandemic by the same research groups using the same CAFE Toolkit to examine how
media exposure patterns varied as a function of the pandemic and how those experiences are related to socio-
emotional outcomes. The P01 will also develop methods to increase the efficiency of coding the quality of
media content, a bottleneck in the field. Finally, the data will be integrated, shared, visualized, and analyzed in
a shared analytic Research Hub.

10922855,"SUMMARY
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disorders initiated by steatosis that can progress to
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Although it is the leading cause of liver disease in the US,
there are no targeted therapeutic interventions, highlighting the critical need for identifying molecular processes
underlying its pathology. Transmembrane protein 55B (TMEM55B) is a PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase located on the
lysosome that has been shown to impact lysosome levels and localization. In preliminary studies, we found that
TMEM55B ASO treatment caused hepatic steatosis in C57BL/6J mice after 6 weeks on western diet, while
TMEM55B knockout mice developed NASH after 12 weeks on a high-fat, cholesterol and fructose supplemented
(GAN) diet. We have identified several effects of TMEM55B knockdown that can promote NAFLD: 1)
accumulation of lipids within lysosomes, indicative of impaired fatty acid (FA) mobilization, 2) impaired
mitochondrial FA oxidation together with reduced mitochondrial volume, mitochondrial fragmentation, and
increased oxidative stress; and 3) in vivo inhibition of hepatic triglyceride secretion. The lysosome plays a critical
role in sorting and processing lipids, where proper lysosome motility is essential for their ability to mobilize FA
from lipid droplets and maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. TMEM55B plays a key role in regulating lysosomal
positioning, thus our central hypothesis is that loss of TMEM55B promotes NAFLD onset and progression
through lysosomal effects on hepatic FA mobilization and trafficking, mitochondrial FA oxidation, and triglyceride
secretion. In Aim 1, we will determine whether TMEM55B impacts FA mobilization and mitochondrial function
through its ability to impact lysosomal localization. We will also examine the impact of TMEM55B on
mitochondrial morphology and dysfunction. Hepatic triglyceride (TG) is primary secreted within VLDL, which is
generated through a multi-step process of lipidating nascent APOB with FA mobilized from lipid droplets. In Aim
2A we will test whether TMEM55B knockdown prevents lipidation of nascent VLDL and test the dependency of
these effects on the lysosome. Men are well-known to have higher NAFLD risk than pre-menopausal women,
however the basis for this sex difference is poorly understood. We found that TMEM55B knockdown caused
steatosis in male, but not female, mice, and that loss of hepatic TMEM55B inhibited TG secretion to a much
greater degree in male versus female mice. The sex-dependent differences in TG secretory defects were
attributed to differences in sex hormones. In Aim 2B we will evaluate the interaction between TMEM55B and sex
hormones on TG secretion in male and female mice, and in estrogen receptor knockout mice. Finally, in Aim 3
we will evaluate the effect pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of TMEM55B on the development and
progression of NAFLD. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which loss of TMEM55B impacts multiple critical
axes of FA metabolism through the lysosome can yield novel insight into factors contributing to NAFLD."

The projects proposed for this grant application seek to characterize response and resistance to treatments for
chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Core 1 will
support the single cell- and immunogenomics-related goals of these projects by focusing on applying the latest
experimental and computational tools to these studies. Bulk and single-cell transcriptome sequencing of immune
and lung cell populations (Aim 1) will be used to identify relevant pathways related to response to treatment of
cGVHD, to identify transcriptional aspects of the metabolic signature elucidated in mouse lung cGVHD models,
and to characterize the lung pathogenesis and immune response related to Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome
(BOS) following HCT. Response of T cells to cGVHD treatments and to BOS will be further characterized by
TCR repertoire analysis using targeted bulk and single-cell sequencing to assess T cell clonality (Aim 2). Core
1 will analyze whole exome sequencing data from donor and recipient DNA to identify polymorphic differences
between donor and recipient, and use tissue expression databases to determine which of these variants are
expressed in lung. Recently developed sophisticated algorithms will be implemented to use this information to
predict personal HLA-binding peptides that comprise minor histocompatibility antigens (Aim 3). The paired
alpha/beta TCR chain single-cell sequence information will be used to reconstruct cell lines expressing individual
enriched TCRs (Aim 4) in order to functionally determine exactly which TCR interacts with which antigen. This
analysis will directly assess if mHAg-directed T cell responses contribute to clinical responses to therapy."
10914139,"Project 1: Defining the T Cell Mediators of Clinical Response in Chronic GVHD
Abstract:
Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) represents the major cause of morbidity and late mortality after
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). While multiple innate and adaptive immune cell populations
contribute to its’ pathophysiology, donor T cells orchestrate cGVHD at all stages, either through their direct
effects, or through their influence on other cell populations. However, despite detailed information about the
mechanisms controlling cGVHD derived from mouse models, and the development of several new clinical
therapeutics, the rates of complete response (CR) remain low: most patients demonstrate only a partial
response to therapy, and many have therapy-refractory cGVHD. Moreover, there is a critical lack of
information about what determines clinical response in individual patients treated for cGVHD. To make
breakthroughs in our understanding of the pathogenesis of human cGVHD and to prioritize the next generation
of therapeutics, we must (1) Accurately define the immune pathways that are active in patients who ultimately
develop cGVHD and (2) Determine the mechanisms of both success and failure of cGVHD treatment regimens
at the level of the individual patient. To accomplish these goals, this Project will complete the following Specific
Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify Risk Assignment immune profiles for cGVHD at Day +100. In Aim 2, we will
determine the evolution of treatment-responsive versus -resistant immune profiles in patients with cGVHD. In
Aim 3 we will investigate the impact of gene modification of Tregs based on completed trajectory analyses from
responders versus non-responders to low-dose IL-2, in order to create an optimized cellular therapeutic to control
cGVHD. By accomplishing these Aims, this Project promises to identify the molecular networks that predict
cGVHD, and those associated with response or resistance to cGVHD therapies, thereby paving the way for a
new era of successful prevention and treatment strategies for this disease."
10914141,"Abstract Our goal is to develop new therapies for chronic GVHD (cGVHD), the leading cause of late morbidity and
mortality after allotransplant. We made the important observation that T cell:B cell cooperativity and class-switched Ig
tissue deposition caused multi-organ system cGVHD with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO), a non-infectious airway
obstructive and epithelial remodeling disorder that portends an abysmal 5 year survival for patients. From proof-of-
concept in cGVHD models, we provided key data leading to clinical trials of 6 new therapies (2 now FDA approved)
for patients failing first-line steroids. CGVHD can be induced by germinal center (GC) T- and B- cell cooperativity, to
produce anti-host Abs and fibrosis. While we observed GC Tfollicular helper cells (Tfh) to have increased glycolysis in
the early cGVHD/BO phase, glycolysis decreased over time, consistent with exhaustion. cGVHD pathogenic Tfh and
Tfollicular regulatory cells (Tfr) that restrain GCs must adapt and thrive in GCs with high reactive oxygen species and
limited energy sources. Our central hypothesis is that cGVHD imposes unique metabolic demands on GC cells for
cGVHD pathogenesis and distinct demands on damaged lung epithelial progenitors, impeding repair and regeneration.
Choosing the best single or combined drug therapies to treat established cGVHD/BO optimally requires targeting
pathogenic (Tfhs, GC B cells) and sparing Tfrs and lung stem/progenitor cells. We will test the hypothesis that rapidly
proliferating Tfh that support GCs depend on multiple energy sources (glutaminolysis, glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis
(FAS), while aberrant GC B cells rely on glycolysis and FAS. Relatedly, we will test the hypothesis that knowing
metabolic pathways required by GC subsets (aim 1) and regenerating lung stem/ progenitor cells (aim 2) will lead to
new druggable targets. Aim 1A proposes to: (1) Interrogate GC subsets for the precise pathways used for energy; (2).
Test if inducing single metabolism gene deletion in a lineage-restricted GC subset in cGVHD/BO mice will improve
pulmonary function and immune parameters; and (3). Test selected metabolism drug candidates in vivo to reverse
ongoing cGVHD/BO. In aim 1B, we hypothesize that a focused CRISPR guide RNA metabolism library of ~40-50
gene targets from aim 1A drug results, U-[13C]-substrate (glucose, glutamine palmitate) labeling and RNA-seq
data, transduced into Cas9 transgenic donor cells infused on day 0 will identify undiscovered metabolism genes
critical for cGVHD/BO pulmonary dysfunction. Drugs to treat immune dysfunction may be offset by detrimental
effects on lung injury repair/regeneration. In aim 2A, we will use scRNA-seq to define altered cell states and
ligand-receptor interactions in distal and proximal airway epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Lung bronchiolar,
alveolar and tracheosphere organoid cultures will be used to identify cells adversely affected by cGVHD/BO. In
aim 2B, we hypothesize that aim 1 drugs effective in targeting GCs and aim 2 drugs in supporting lung cell
regeneration will guide drug selection to inhibit cGVHD/ BO pathogenesis and repair lung injury with a high
predictive value for superior cGVHD/BO outcomes. These novel approaches provide unprecedented mechanistic
data to elucidate pathogenesis and lead to new therapies."
10914143,"Project Summary – Project 3
Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) is a progressive, irreversible, and often fatal lung disease that occurs
following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). BOS occurs in approximately 5-10% of HCT
survivors and is the pulmonary manifestation of chronic graft-vs.-host disease (cGVHD). Approximately 10-15%
of cGVHD patients develop BOS, and less than 15% of BOS patients survive 5 years. The primary immunologic
focus of attack in BOS is the small airway, leading to pathologic fibrosis. BOS has no cure, and treatment options
are limited. Little is known about the pathophysiology of BOS. Innovations in lung organoid culture and
immunogenomics offers a means to pinpoint the cellular and antigenic targets of BOS, and our murine model of
BOS has proven invaluable in identifying promising therapeutics for this disease. Given these advances, in this
Project, we hypothesize that we can reverse BOS with a promising pharmacologic agent that addresses
dysregulated immunity and reduces fibrosis while fundamentally improving our understanding of the
pathophysiology of BOS by using in vitro models to identify the cellular and antigenic targets of immunologic
attack in BOS.
We will test these hypotheses by performing a clinical trial of the novel agent, KD025, in subjects with BOS.
KD025 is a ROCK2 inhibitor whose mechanism of action was initially deciphered and tested by our group. This
agent has shown promising activity in cGVHD therapy and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase II trial will
determine the BOS response rate, measured by NIH cGVHD Response Criteria, in a cohort of subjects with new
onset and steroid-refractory BOS, following a 24-week course of KD025. In this trial we will also test whether
CT-scan based parametric response mapping can act an imaging biomarker in BOS.
Using samples from subjects being treated on the KD025 trial, we will establish an airway organoid (AO) platform
to study mechanisms and therapeutic avenues for BOS. Using AO, we will study cellular injury and cell-cell
interactions in BOS, and we will test whether AO can serve as treatment response indicators to therapeutic
drugs. The precise role of lung-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in the pathobiology of BOS is unknown; using cutting

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Neurodegenerative Diseases, organized by
Drs. Leonard Petrucelli, Stacie Weninger and Soyon Hong. The conference will be held Santa Fe, New Mexico
from June 3–6, 2024.
As the population ages, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, thus creating a major public
health problem given the virtual lack of effective treatments for these complex diseases. Fortunately, new
technological advances impacting basic science, genetics and translational research are enabling the discovery
of novel risk genes and disease pathways, and the development and testing of potential therapeutics. Indeed,
modern genomic, epigenomic and biological tools including gene editing, spatial transcriptomics, single-molecule
fluorescence, viral vector engineering, and organoid development have greatly contributed to discoveries
revealing the importance of immune mechanisms, RNA metabolism, and lysosomal biology in neurodegenerative
disease pathogenesis. This conference will bring together leaders in basic, translational and clinical research to
discuss their latest findings and to chart new directions in the field. In addition, emerging models, tools and
technologies that support a more comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative diseases will be
highlighted. Finally, this conference is being paired with the Keystone Symposia conference on Neuroimmune
Interactions: Nervous System and Immune Cell Heterogeneity in Health and Disease. This pairing is ideal due
to the strong involvement of immune pathways in multiple neurodegenerative disorders and will also enable
attendees to learn about the latest research in these increasingly overlapping fields."

The mechanisms discovered through the study of embryogenesis have been fundamental to understanding
disease. We use classic chicken embryology and sophisticated mouse genetics to elucidate how basic cellular
processes define the shape and function of organs. We are most fascinated by left-right (LR) organ asymmetry,
as errors of organ laterality are linked to life-threatening birth defects. The counterclockwise rotation of the gut
is an excellent model to study organ laterality. A critical aspect of this rotation is initiation of a leftward tilt
directed by the master regulator of LR asymmetry, Pitx2. Failure to do so leads to gut malrotation and
catastrophic volvulus in pediatric patients. Whereas rotation forces had long been assumed intrinsic to the gut
tube, we instead discovered that gut rotation is driven by asymmetric deformation of the adjacent dorsal
mesentery (DM) that suspends the gut, and whose cellular architecture is downstream of Pitx2. A key property
of the DM is its exquisite binary organization, with distinct LR compartments that are readily accessible to
genetic manipulation. Cellular and extracellular matrix (ECM) changes in each compartment cause the DM to
deform and tilt the attached gut tube leftward. This critical bias determines gut chirality and frames a model to
explain how LR gene expression is ultimately responsible for changes in cell behavior that initiate asymmetric
organogenesis. The DM is also the sole conduit for blood and lymphatic vessels that serve the gut. We
discovered that Pitx2-dependent mechanisms directing gut tilting are also crucial for patterning the gut
vasculature and provide a mechanism to coordinate these two processes. Whereas most situs-specific
organogenesis depends on Pitx2, mechanistic studies downstream have been hampered by a confounding
“double-right” isomerism in Pitx2 mutants. Whereas Pitx2 expression in all vertebrates is activated by Nodal,
Nodal disappears before asymmetric morphogenesis, leaving unresolved the question of how Pitx2
directs organogenesis. We discovered that Pitx2 expression in the gut is not an extension of previous induction
by Nodal. Instead, we demonstrate that gut rotation requires a “second wave” of Pitx2 that is subject to
mechanoregulation by the latent TGFb, linking LR gene expression to force translation. In aim 1, we determine
the mechanism of Pitx2 dose response during gut, vascular, and lymphatic development and identify two
distinct roles for Pitx2 dependent on its repressive threshold on BMP4 signaling. In aim 2, we define the
molecular mechanism by which the formin Daam2, a Pitx2 target, directs mesenchymal cell polarity, actomyosin
contractile asymmetry, and thereby steers the forces to polarize tilting. In aim 3, we combine cutting-edge physical
measurements of tissue properties with quantitative imaging and computational modeling, to elucidate how
stiffness and force anisotropies drive gut rotation through mechanical feedback. Together, these studies will
significantly advance our understanding of the transcriptional and mechanical control of asymmetric gut and
vascular morphogenesis, a critical step toward improved malrotation diagnostics in newborns."
10908318,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Dr. Juliane Gust proposes a study to understand whether perturbations of the BBB and cerebral
microvascular perfusion contribute to CAR T cell neurotoxicity. This work will prepare Dr. Gust for
independence as a translational clinician-scientist at the intersection of neurology, oncology, and immunology.
 In CAR T cell therapy, patients’ T cells are modified with a receptor that recognizes cancer cell surface
markers, and induces T cell killing of the target. Thousands of patients with previously little hope of cure have
benefitted from CD19-directed CAR T cells for leukemia and lymphoma. However, ~40% develop neurologic
toxicity, and ~1% die from cerebral edema. The mechanism of neurotoxicity is poorly understood. In patients,
Dr. Gust has shown evidence of endothelial activation, glial injury, leukocyte infiltrates, and microhemorrhages.
To model neurotoxicity in mice, Dr. Gust treated wild type mice with high dose CD19-CAR T cells made from
syngeneic donor mice of the same inbred strain. CAR T treated mice, unlike mice treated with untransduced T
cells, develop systemic cytokine release, abnormal behavior, and widespread cerebral microhemorrhages.
Taken together, the human and mouse data suggest the following hypotheses: that the BBB is disrupted during
neurotoxicity (Aim 1), and that neurotoxicity is accompanied by altered cerebral blood flow (Aim 2).
 For Aim 1, Dr. Gust will use immunolabeling of individual NVU components (endothelial cells, tight
junctions, pericytes, basement membrane, astrocyte endfeet) and quantify cell number, shape, and contiguity.
She will inject intravascular tracers followed by fluorescent and electron microscopy to visualize tracer leakage
via paracellular and transcellular pathways. She will assess the contribution of immune infiltrates to BBB
breakdown by flow cytometry and histology with colabeling for matrix metalloprotease-9. If disruption of the
NVU by structural or functional alteration is confirmed, we can conclude that it is a key link from systemic
inflammation to brain dysfunction, which warrants further detailed mechanistic studies. For Aim 2, Dr. Gust will
measure blood flow in mouse cortical arterioles, capillaries and venules via in-vivo two-photon imaging through
a thinned skull window. This innovative approach allows visualization of hemodynamics with single microvessel
resolution by measuring vessel diameter and speed of red blood cell transit. To test the hypothesis that CAR T
cell treatment leads to leukocyte adherence to vessel walls and consequent slowing of blood flow, transit and
rolling of GFP-expressing CAR T cells and Rhodamine-6G labeled leukocytes and platelets will be quantified.
Confirmation of impaired microvascular blood flow would guide a reconsideration of therapeutic approaches.
 During the award period, Dr. Gust will receive training in animal model development, advanced imaging
techniques, immunology, vascular biology, rigor in experimental design and analysis, science communication,
networking, and leadership skills. Under the guidance of primary mentor Dr. Andy Shih and her mentoring
team, she will use data from this proposal to develop an R01 application for transition to independence."
10908432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S.
Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and
CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women
gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and
underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of
excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions
during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.
 Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong
motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully
combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established
behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of
postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and
Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine,
and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these
women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods
and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic
health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to
identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a
2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational
hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social
feedback from other postpartum women.
 This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive
lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women
remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with
established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in
advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to
become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to
independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The
results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application."

Among patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their informal caregivers,
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a critical need requiring scalable, evidence-
based intervention. As many as 97% of patients with ADRD will ultimately experience BPSD, yet they are
poorly managed and remain the top source of caregiver burden. Technology may be a solution; indeed, the
National Institute on Aging and others demand mobile technology-based behavioral interventions to support
informal caregivers of patients with ADRD. Systematic reviews and market analyses of existing mobile
technologies or “apps” demonstrate promise but critical limitations: lack of scientific foundation and evidence of
efficacy; missing features and functions; and low to moderate quality.
Our interdisciplinary team followed the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development to:
1) establish an evidence-based intervention model for BPSD management (NIH Model Stage 0); 2) apply user-
centered design to embed this evidence-based model into Brain CareNotes, a mobile telehealth app (NIH
Model Stage IA); and 3) conduct I-CARE, a set-up pilot study that established the feasibility and potential
efficacy of Brain CareNotes (NIH Model Stage IB-II). The pilot study demonstrated that at the 6-month
endpoint, Brain CareNotes reduced informal caregiver burden and reduced BPSD.
Here we propose I-CARE 2, a Stage III randomized clinical trial (RCT), as the next step in the NIH Stage
Model. I-CARE 2 will evaluate the real-world efficacy of Brain CareNotes on the primary outcomes of informal
caregiver burden and BPSD at 12 months. We plan to enroll N=160 community-dwelling, English-speaking
informal caregivers of patients with ADRD, across the state of Indiana. Informal caregivers will be randomized
(stratified by sex and race) to 12 months of Brain CareNotes (n=80) or Attention Control education-only app
(Dementia Guide Expert) (n=80). Follow-up will occur at 12 months, with additional assessments at 6 months
to test for early effects. We will test primary hypotheses that, relative to Attention Control, informal caregivers
randomized to Brain CareNotes will have: (H1) lower caregiver burden as measured by the Caregiver Distress
sub-score on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); and (H2) lower BPSD as measured by the NPI Total Score.
Secondary hypotheses will be tested comparing groups on (H3) depressive symptoms as measured by the
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and (H4) acute care utilization as determined by the number of hospital
and emergency room visits captured in the statewide regional health information exchange.
If successful, this NIH Stage III RCT study will yield evidence of the efficacy of a highly scalable non-
pharmacological intervention for BPSD, one of the most burdensome aspects of ADRD care. If our caregiver-
facing mobile telehealth app is efficacious in real-world settings, subsequent Stage IV-V effectiveness and
implementation research efforts can help relieve the critical public health burden of ADRD."

10908522,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive deficits such as memory loss, as well as deficits in the
motivation that drives daily activities. These cognitive and motivational deficits are linked to widespread neuronal
and synaptic atrophy, coupled with aggregated extracellular Aβ-plaque and tau deposits, and atypical neural
activity across multiple frequencies. Recent work in mouse models of AD have shown that inducing gamma
oscillations with a non-invasive gamma-frequency (40 Hz) light-flickering and auditory tone-stimulation regimes
reduced Aβ plaques and improved spatial and recognition memory. In humans, restoring gamma-frequency
activity while preserving its phase-amplitude coupling with theta-band activity are shown to recover human
memory performance in older adults, and in patients with mild AD, thus offering a promising route towards a
novel therapy that can prevent brain atrophy while improving cognition. Despite their recent successes, it is a
major challenge to translate gamma-frequency neurostimulation from a laboratory study to a behavioral
intervention. Our goal is to promote healthy neurocognitive aging using lifestyle interventions; in particular,
interventions that sustainably elevate mood and reward motivated behavior while encouraging social bonding
may be most promising in slowing the progression of AD. Music listening engages multiple brain networks
involved in sensory processing, movement, language, attention, learning and memory, emotion and reward, and
social connectedness. Music-Based Interventions (MBIs) have the potential to manage symptoms, slow disease
progression, and improve quality of life. Our lab has recently shown that an eight-week MBI can increase auditory
functional connectivity to the reward system. Here we propose to test a novel protocol for music-based brain
stimulation, gamma-MBI: gamma-light stimulation that automatically adapts to music-based intervention.
Harnessing the fact that music listening is an intrinsically rewarding activity, we propose to use music as a carrier
for gamma sensory stimulation. As music contains theta-band acoustic energy, music listening is a form of theta-
band noninvasive brain stimulation. We will test and refine a novel brain-stimulation tool using gamma-frequency
lights coupled with self-selected music for a gamma-music-based intervention for participants with mild
Alzheimer’s Disease. Results will yield a gamma-stimulation protocol that reliably influences brain activity (Aim
1), is adaptive, motivating and rewarding to use (Aim 2), and will generate predictions as to who might benefit
the most from gamma-MBI (Aim 3). By bridging the gap between neurostimulation and behavioral intervention
by combining music therapy with gamma-band neurostimulation, the present project aims to find a sustainable
intervention that delays the progression of AD. Our team is uniquely qualified to address all aspects of this
innovative and ambitious project."

Understanding the distribution and dynamics of human pathogens is fundamental to control infectious
diseases by guiding where and when to target resources. Until now, however, efforts to understand
the dynamics of most pathogens have been conducted in isolation, focusing on one specific disease
at a time.
Over the past years, high throughput multiplexed serological assays have become available, allowing
to simultaneously quantify antibody responses against 100s and even 1000s of antigens, from a
single sample. These novel technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to (1) study the dynamics
of multiple pathogens simultaneously, (2) characterize immune profiles of populations, and (3)
evaluate hypotheses around immunological interactions within and between pathogen groups.
Numerous methodological and computational challenges remain in terms of how to make meaningful
epidemiological inferences from these new tools.
We have been developing methods to analyze and estimate key transmission parameters from
multiple sources of data, with a focus on serological assays. This proposal will expand these lines of
work, developing tools and analytic methods necessary to translate the promise of high throughput
serology into mechanistic insights about pathogen dynamics. We will leverage existing collaborations
with researchers at the forefront of these technologies, as well as detailed population studies
(including longitudinal birth cohorts and cross-sectional studies) that have collected and characterized
serum samples to apply and evaluate these platforms in over 10 countries. We aim to develop and
validate a suite of robust computational and analytical pipelines with the goal of (1) reconstructing the
longitudinal evolution of antibody repertoires in individuals within and across pathogen groups as a
function of infection history, and (2) characterizing transmission histories and immune profiles of
populations. In developing our analytical pipelines, we will perform extensive simulation studies to
evaluate the performance of different models under multiple assumptions of how the data is
generated. We will then perform data analysis and inference to reconstruct transmission histories,
susceptibility profiles of populations to multiple pathogens, estimate attack rates, and characterize
longitudinal evolution of antibody responses. This will be the most comprehensive assessment, and
validation, of population and individual serological responses across pathogen groups, performed to
date. Through these projects, we will also develop a suite of open-source software/tools to
disseminate our methods and allow other researchers to analyze their data and gain insight into
immune landscapes population risk profiles.
This project will create tools that use high-throughput multiplexed serological data to answer
fundamental questions on the dynamics and interactions of different pathogen groups and provide
insights that can be used by policymakers to guide infectious disease control efforts."

Older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) often take multiple medications and use
potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), placing them at increased risk of adverse drug events, drug
interactions, treatment burden, and mortality. Deprescribing (reducing or stopping medications that are harmful
or unlikely to be beneficial) can improve outcomes for people living with dementia (PLWD). The overarching
goal of this proposal is to refine and pilot an intervention in which ADRD care partners are identified in primary
care and provided with educational materials through the patient portal to engage them in deprescribing for
PLWD. We propose a multicomponent intervention, eAlign, which includes: 1) Facilitated patient portal
registration for both PLWD and care partners; and 2) delivery of a patient portal intervention to align medication
decisions with PLWD and care partners goals, provide care partner training in nonpharmacologic treatment of
behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and reduce polypharmacy and PIM use. We propose the
following specific aims: In Aim 1, we characterize triadic interactions regarding medication use from two
complementary perspectives. In Aim 1a we assess how communication dynamics and characteristics of
PLWD and care partners affect uptake of deprescribing recommendations during consultation with a clinical
pharmacist. We qualitatively analyze content of 120 audiorecorded visits conducted as part of an ongoing,
pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention for PLWD and their care partners in primary care. In Aim 1b we
identify individual (PLWD) and contextual (health system, clinic, clinician) factors that affect use of the patient
portal for medication management among PLWD by examining uptake and use of the patient portal from date
and time-stamped electronic interactions of n=7,500 PLWD receiving primary care in two health systems. In
Aim 2, we iteratively refine the eAlign protocol through a user-centered design process involving in-depth
interviews with key stakeholders (n=15-20 patient-care partner dyads and 10-15 frontline staff, clinicians,
clinical informaticists and health system leaders) at both health care systems. In Aim 3, we will pilot the
resultant eAlign protocol with a total of 100 patient-care partner dyads at both health care systems to establish
feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy for a future multisite cluster randomized trial. We will conduct a
two-group pilot randomized trial to examine feasibility of measuring two primary outcomes (total number of
chronic daily medications and rates of PIM prescriptions among PLWD) and one caregiver-reported secondary
outcome, the Family Caregiver Medication Administration Hassles Scale. This work will establish the
preliminary data, methods, and partnerships to undertake a multisite embedded pragmatic clinical trial of a
triadic-based behavioral intervention to promote patient and care partner engagement, foster care that aligns
with patients’ values, and promote improved health and well-being outcomes for PLWD and their care partners."

The continuing discoveries of RNAs and their critical roles in cellular and viral machinery
are inspiring novel antibacterial, antitumor, antiviral, and genome-editing therapies
based on disabling, manipulating, and repurposing the RNAs involved. Unfortunately,
our poor biophysical understanding of `how RNAs work' is slowing the development of
these potentially life-saving efforts. A critical bottleneck has been the inapplicability of
crystallography, NMR, phylogenetic analysis, and biochemical methods to determine the
partly ordered conformations of non-coding RNAs in all their functional states. To
address this bottleneck, we bring together biophysical modeling, electron microscopy,
high throughput biochemical/sequencing experiments, machine learning, wet-lab-
integrated crowdsourcing, and a wide collaborative network. Current projects that
exemplify our approach involve the COVID-19 pandemic. With our Ribosolve hybrid
structure determination pipeline, we are discovering that numerous segments of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome form well-defined 3D structures whose targeting by
antisense oligonucleotides inhibits viral replication. In the OpenVaccine challenge, we
are developing highly structured COVID-19 mRNA vaccines with sufficient in vitro
stability to enable world-wide shipping of mRNA in prefilled syringes. This COVID-19
research has benefited from our agile approach and the flexibility allowed by MIRA
support; many of the computational and experimental methods we use now did not exist
before the pandemic. Because RNA is so fundamental to life, tackling many of science's
further `big questions' in human disease could be accelerated if we could visualize and
design any RNA. My lab seeks to create the RNA computational and experimental
foundation needed to get all of us there in upcoming years."

Human cognition is a product of vastly complex interactions between different cellular networks that continues to elude a mechanistic link to neurobiology. Our understanding of the brain basis for cognition has benefitted from studying human conditions in which cognitive disability is linked to single gene mutations that disrupt healthy cortical development early in life. One such condition is Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 that presents a variety of clinical symptoms including transient autistic-like behavioral deficits, severe cognitive impairments, and abnormal scalp electrophysiology (EEG) activity. However, it is unclear how abnormal cellular network formation gives rise to reported patient EEG abnormalities and associated cognitive disability. Our understanding is severely limited by a fundamental lack of knowledge of any convergent mechanisms relating gene mutations and cortical activity in the developing human brain to cognition within the same individual. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that there is a convergent mechanism for aberrant cortical activity and cognitive disability housed in the patient transcriptome that can be identified across electrophysiological scales, ranging from in vitro brain organoid electrophysiology to non-invasive human EEG. By using RTT as a genetic model for human neurodevelopment, this proposal aims to leverage multimodal brain data from the same individual to advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognition in health and disease. To do so, this proposal will identify biomarkers of cortical function via parallel in vivo and in vitro analytical approaches relating electrophysiological and genetic features to cognitive ability and disease severity. This research will use state-of-the-art analytical tools to parameterize electrophysiological periodic and aperiodic features of scalp EEG from RTT and healthy participants and correlate them to genetic and electrophysiological features of brain organoids derived from the same human participants’ induced pluripotent stem cells. Project findings will define novel electrophysiological and molecular biomarkers for cognitive ability across brain data modalities. These results are expected to have a positive impact in the development of preclinical models of neurodevelopmental disorders as they will provide a strong evidence-based proof of principle for using human-derived tissue cultures to test potential new, personalized therapies in a safe and high-throughput manner."

This proposal to continue in the Pancreatic Cancer Detection Consortium will further build and enhance our
biospecimen resource that collects longitudinal blood samples on patients at risk of developing pancreatic cancer
and unique tissue resources that include rare pancreatic premalignant lesions. We propose to continue and
enhance our discovery and validation of blood-based and imaging-based biomarkers that have the potential to
detect and differentiate the earliest possible stages of pancreatic lesions that are likely to progress to cancer.
This proposal proceeds from an ongoing effort that was initiated 3.5 years ago in which we have enrolled
approximately 469 patients with known germline mutations or with significant inherited risk of unknown etiology
(more than 2 affected with no defined mutations) for pancreatic cancer. We prospectively collect biological
specimens (100 mL blood) and detailed clinical data every six months from an at-risk cohort that represents the
target population envisioned for clinical application of biomarkers with potential to detect pancreatic cancer. In
addition to patients with inherited risk, we will continue to collect longitudinal samples on groups of patients with
increased risk of pancreatic cancer: those with pancreatic cystic neoplasms or chronic pancreatitis, and new
onset diabetes (NOD). We also propose three biomarker research specific aims that have grown out of progress
during the previous grant award. One aim will build upon our previous results with mucin type biomarkers and
related glycoproteins by examining the potential of a set of additional biomarkers to improve detection cancer
prior to clinical diagnosis in the earliest stages of disease progression. A second aim will examine the capacity
of newly identified antibodies to CEACAM6 to identify earliest lesions in the pancreas by immunohistochemistry
and state of the art imaging modalities. A third aim will determine the performance characteristics of a panel of
exosome-based biomarkers detecting early pancreatic cancer and differentiating benign cystic lesions from
those that progress to cancer."
10915851,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Joinpoint regression developed by the NCI Surveillance Research Program is increasingly used to identify the
timing and extent of changes in time series of health outcomes and to project future disease burden. Many
analyses of population data (e.g., cancer stage at diagnosis, causes of death, and patterns of health behavior),
including those often used in joinpoint regression, are based on percentages or proportions, as the focus is
typically on relative, not absolute frequencies. Such time series of compositional variables need to be modeled
simultaneously to guarantee the coherency of the individual temporal trends; that is the predicted percentages
sum to 100% at each time step. Analyzing temporal trends outside a spatial framework is also unsatisfactory
because significant variation even within a single State is not accounted for. Modeling multivariate time series
in a spatial framework is a significant theoretical, methodological and computational challenge that is not
tackled by the NCI software. This research will address this need using spatial compositional data analysis
(CoDa) whereby geostatistical noise-filtering and time trend modeling is conducted on logtransforms of ratios.
This SBIR project is developing the first commercial software to offer tools for spatial geostatistical noise-
filtering and joinpoint regression analysis of time series of compositional variables in epidemiology. The
research product will be a stand-alone desktop space-time (ST) analysis and visualization tool, building on the
legacy core software developed by BioMedware. These tools will be suited for the analysis of data outside
health sciences, such as in geochemistry, economy or soil science, broadening significantly the commercial
market for the end product. This project will accomplish three aims:
 Develop a simulation-based methodology to propagate the uncertainty caused by the small number
 problem through the computation of the main types of log-ratio transform available in the CoDa literature
 and compare the robustness of subsequent analysis with respect to this noise. The modeling of temporal
 trends by joinpoint regression will be adapted to the compositional nature of the data. These are all novel
 approaches that are currently not available in the statistical literature.
 Develop and test a prototype module that will implement novel methods (propagation of uncertainty,
 modeling of multivariate temporal trends) developed under Objective #1 into BioMedware’s space-time
 visualization and analysis technology (Vesta software).
 Conduct a usability and user experience study and identify additional methods and tools for Phase II work,
 including the first CoDa advisor to guide the user through the selection and interpretation of appropriate
 data representations based on the type of data (i.e., continuous vs count data, rounded vs true zeros).
These technologic, scientific and commercial innovations will enhance our ability to incorporate compositional
data into any epidemiological problem with an underlying spatial or temporal reference."
10915385,"This project, A Longitudinal Study of the Durability of Valganciclovir Therapy on Long-Term Hearing and
Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Adolescents Treated During Infancy for Symptomatic Congenital
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Diseases, will be led by David W. Kimberlin, MD. It uses a randomized cohort from an
earlier study of the treatment of infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease to ascertain whether the
treatment benefits on hearing and developmental outcomes seen to 2 years of age persist over the ensuing
decade. That study, known as the CASG 112 trial, was conducted by the Collaborative Antiviral Study Group
and enrolled 109 subjects between 2008 and 2011. It documented that a 6 month duration of treatment of
symptomatic congenital CMV provided superior hearing and developmental outcomes compared with 6 weeks
of antiviral treatment, and that these benefits persisted to 2 years of age. What is not known, though, is
whether these benefits persist longer than this, and whether there are any longer-term toxicities from
valganciclovir therapy provided very early in life.
Subjects previously enrolled in the CASG 112 study are approaching their 12th birthday. We will bring them
back when they are 12 years of age for hearing and developmental assessments. Returning subjects also will
have a pubertal assessment as a marker for potential gonadotoxicity from the earlier valganciclovir therapy,
and for inquiry about development of any cancers.
The results of this study will be important. If these benefits on hearing and development are durable, it
suggests that treatment does not need to be longer than 6 months duration. On the other hand, if the benefits
of 6 months of treatment are not durable (that is, if they wane over time), this is of equal value because it
illumines the next study that needs to be conducted to assesses treatment of perhaps 12 months (or even
longer), with or without the addition of a second antiviral drug such as letermovir. Also, if longer-term toxicities
from the earlier valganciclovir therapy are identified, this will have a direct impact on the clinical treatment of
patients with symptomatic congenital CMV disease. Most importantly, knowledge will be gained from this
longitudinal study of long-term hearing and developmental outcomes following what is now the standard
duration of treatment (6 months) that will benefit children who have received this course of therapy."

meningoencephalitis or pneumonitis. Although a number of viruses can cause neonatal viral sepsis, including
herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenovirus, two of the most frequent causes are
enteroviruses (EVs) and human parechoviruses (HPeVs). Antiviral treatment for neonatal EV or HPeV sepsis
is needed, but not yet commercially available. The design of future antiviral trials for neonatal viral sepsis
would greatly benefit from a better understanding of the natural history of this serious, but rare, condition.
More precise definition of rates of long-term morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal EV and HPeV
sepsis, and better delineation of clinical and laboratory parameters that are predictive of adverse outcomes,
are important to inform the optimal design of therapeutic trials, including issues such as appropriate endpoints,
sample size, and inclusion criteria. The potential utility of quantitative PCR (qPCR) or other laboratory
biomarkers to predict severity of illness, long-term sequelae, or mortality in these illnesses is currently
unknown. If qPCR was shown to be a useful predictor of or surrogate for clinical outcomes, this could greatly
facilitate the performance of therapeutic trials. Finally, studies to date suggest that a portion of children
presenting clinically with neonatal viral sepsis do not have EVs, HPeVs, or other known viruses. It is important
to better understand the full spectrum of etiologic agents using state-of-the-art tools for pathogen discovery.
The proposed study is designed to fill in these gaps in our knowledge about neonatal viral sepsis to advance
trial readiness for the anticipated development of antiviral treatment therapy for this condition. This will be
accomplished by evaluating the following specific aims: 1) to estimate the morbidity and mortality rates of
neonatal EV sepsis and neonatal HPeV sepsis; 2) to identify clinical and laboratory parameters, including
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), predictive of morbidity and mortality from neonatal EV and
neonatal HPeV sepsis; and 3) to determine the etiologies of neonatal viral sepsis not due to EV, HPeV, HSV,
CMV, and adenovirus using next-gen sequencing for pathogen discovery. The systematic prospective
multicenter assessment of neonatal viral sepsis, including EV and HPeV sepsis, will produce data that can be
used in the design of future Phase I, II, and III treatment studies with antiviral drugs currently in development
by pharmaceutical companies, such as KYORIN Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Vaxart, Inc."
10915387,"This study, A Phase I Adaptive, Multiple Dose Pharmacokinetic and Safety Assessment of Valacyclovir in
Infants at Risk of Acquiring Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus Disease, is led by David W. Kimberlin, MD.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a rare cause of disease in neonates, but when it occurs the results frequently
are devastating. Despite important advances over the past thirty years in the treatment of neonatal HSV
disease, significant numbers of babies die or are left with lifelong neurologic sequelae. While the
improvements in outcomes from antiviral interventions have been significant, the best mechanism of averting
death, neurologic damage, and emotional distress from neonatal HSV is to prevent the disease from occurring
in the first place.
Since 85% of babies developing neonatal HSV disease acquire the virus from their mothers during the birth
process, detecting which women are shedding HSV would allow a rational, targeted approach focusing on
those neonates at risk. To accomplish this, however, a simple, standardized, rapid test for detecting HSV in
the maternal genital tract at the time of delivery is required, and a therapeutic intervention that can be used in
neonates exposed to HSV to prevent HSV disease from developing is needed. In a major step toward
accomplishing such an approach, we have completed enrolling an NIH-funded study, in collaboration with
Cepheid Inc., to validate a novel point-of-care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using the company's
Xpert diagnostic platform for the detection of HSV DNA in vaginal swabs of pregnant women at delivery
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01878383).
While this study is an important diagnostic advance, our ultimate goal is to assess whether preemptive antiviral
treatment of babies exposed to HSV at delivery, as detected by Xpert PCR assessment of a maternal vaginal
swab, can prevent HSV exposure at delivery from progressing to neonatal HSV infection and thus to neonatal
HSV disease. To assess this, we will need to conduct a Phase III treatment study in neonates exposed to HSV
at delivery using oral valacyclovir (due to its superior oral bioavailability compared with oral acyclovir). Prior to
this, though, we need to know what dose of valacyclovir administered to neonates safely provides the targeted
acyclovir exposure that we identified previously in babies who already have acquired HSV infection. We
therefore will conduct a Phase I pharmacokinetic study through the Congenital and Perinatal Infections
Consortium (CPIC) to determine the optimal valacyclovir dose and thereby provide trial readiness for the next,
larger efficacy study."
10915388,"This project, A Phase I Adaptive, Escalating Single-Dose and Multiple-Dose Pharmacokinetic and Safety
Assessment of Letermovir in Infants with Symptomatic Congenital Cytomegalovirus Disease, is led by David
W. Kimberlin, MD. Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading non-genetic cause of
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and the most frequent known viral cause of mental retardation, affecting
0.5% to 0.7% of live births in industrialized countries. With a U.S. birth cohort of 3.8 million annually, between
19,000 and 26,600 babies are estimated to be born each year with congenital CMV infection. Ten percent of
congenitally infected neonates have symptomatic disease at delivery, of whom 35% have SNHL, up to two-
thirds have neurologic deficits, and 4% die in the newborn period. SNHL occurs at a lower rate among the
90% of congenitally infected neonates who are asymptomatic at delivery, but because there are so many more
asymptomatic neonates than symptomatic ones the majority of cases of SNHL caused by CMV occurs in this
asymptomatic group.
The number of antiviral drugs with activity against CMV is very small, with only three active moieties approved
by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA): foscarnet (approved in 1991), ganciclovir (approved in 1994),
and cidofovir (approved in 1996). Valganciclovir, the L-valine ester of ganciclovir and therefore the same
moiety as ganciclovir, was approved in 2001. To date, all studies of the treatment of congenital CMV disease
have utilized ganciclovir or valganciclovir, and have documented a modest benefit of treatment on hearing and
developmental outcomes. In addition, we have found that patients with symptomatic congenital CMV disease
who achieve viral suppression to ≤ 2.5 log by day 14 of therapy and then maintain it over the next 4 months are
statistically more likely to have improved hearing across the first two years of life.
In November 2017, the FDA approved letermovir for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in adult CMV-
seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, making it the first new CMV drug in
over two decades. The availability of letermovir as a safe and effective antiviral drug with a completely
different mechanism of action from ganciclovir offers the opportunity to explore combination therapy. First,
though, the pharmacokinetics and safety of letermovir in neonates must be characterized. We propose to
perform a Phase I adaptive, multi-center, dose-escalation evaluation of single-dose and multiple-dose
administration of intravenous letermovir in infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease to develop a safe
dosing regimen for neonates and young infants with symptomatic congenital CMV disease."
10915389,"The mission of the Congenital and Perinatal Infections Consortium (CPIC) is to eliminate the disease burden
associated with rare pediatric viral diseases focusing on congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, neonatal
herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and neonatal enterovirus (EV) and parechovirus (HPeV) sepsis by
gathering multi-site data to improve diagnosis, clinical trial readiness, and treatment. Annually, we will support
one year-long project that contributes to this mission and utilizes the strengths of the CPIC.
Though the specific focus of each Pilot Program RFA will be determined by the Executive Committee, all RFAs
will stress innovation in our focused disease areas and extension of research collaborations both within and
outside of the CPIC. All CPIC pilot projects will advance knowledge in this important area and will serve as a
mentored research opportunity for junior investigators interested in rare diseases. Consistent with this mission,
in addition to financial support, pilot recipients will benefit from mentors who serve as part of project
management teams designed to ensure research progress and to facilitate success as they develop
independent research programs. The infrastructure and activities of the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Core are
designed to: 1) identify innovative research projects that improve diagnosis, clinical trial readiness and/or
treatment for congenital CMV disease, neonatal HSV infection, or neonatal EV and HPeV sepsis; 2) identify
and support promising junior investigators who are interested in conducting mentored research in the area of
these rare diseases; and 3) engage project management teams to mentor pilot recipients and facilitate their
movement toward independence.
The CPIC P&F Core will be led by Richard J. Whitley, MD, who has successfully developed and led the
Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance pilot program. He will work with the CPIC Executive Committee, which
includes stakeholder representation, to craft an annual call for applications. The CPIC P&F Core will ensure
high-quality pilot research by sponsoring a competition for funding that is peer-reviewed and mirrors reviews
conducted by the NIH. The application process will include an initial letter of intent (LOI), followed by
submission of invited, full applications. For the review of LOIs and the selection of meritorious applications,
Dr. Whitley will chair a Selection Committee comprised of himself and four CPIC site leads. To allow for
expansion of our investment, projects will be eligible to receive additional support from participating institutions,
an opportunity that will be especially encouraged in the case of multi-site applications. Once funded, projects
will receive support from multidisciplinary project management teams to ensure successful completion of
projects."

skills and knowledge for those at all career stages in support of a diverse, innovative, and ethically rigorous
research base. The overall goal of the Core is to provide didactic and experiential training in clinical and
translational research in order to enhance scientific knowledge and an understanding of stakeholder
perspectives unique to the rare diseases patient cohort.
To develop CPIC Research Scholars, the Career Enhancement Core will: 1) identify and recruit a promising
and diverse cohort of pediatric investigators for career enhancement and mentored research in rare diseases
caused by congenital and perinatal infections; 2) expand the formal training of nascent investigators in
research methodology, rigorous study design and scientific writing, all skills that are crucial to successful
investigation and dissemination of findings in collaboration with UAB's NCATS-funded Center for Clinical and
Translational Science (CCTS); and 3) stimulate experiential learning via the development of externships or
“mini-sabbaticals” within the CPIC, including industry and community stakeholder partners. Externships across
the CPIC will expand and foster increased collaborations and interactions between consortium institutions in a
way that contributes to outstanding science and further growth of our research base.
Led by Michael J. Mugavero, MD, MHSc, the Career Enhancement Oversight Committee will select fellows
and early stage investigators as Research Scholars. These Scholars will receive training in a variety of skills
including: 1) the regulatory and ethical requirements of research; special topics specific to rare diseases and
CPIC-specific research such as pharmacometrics, 2) an understanding of stakeholder perspective and the
communication of scientific results in appropriate formats for different audiences, and methodological issues
related to study design and implementation; 3) core competencies of clinical and translational science,

The Administrative Core will provide oversight of all Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (EZID)
center components and functions. The Administrative Core consists of the PI/PD, Associate Director (AD),
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), External Advisory Committee (EAC), Project Mentors, and Research
Core Facility Directors. The Administrative Core personnel have research interests in the mission of the EZID
core theme as well as extensive grant management, general administrative, center management, and faculty
mentoring experience. EAC members with outstanding qualifications and whose research interests strongly align
with EZID will be recruited. The two core facilities are each managed by a Core director with relevant expertise
and they directly support the primary projects and other center programs. The faculty mentoring program and
EZID programs will also be directed by the Administrative Core. The faculty mentoring program is tailored to
the primary projects, with individual development plans and external mentors that have strong expertise relevant
to the project, and internal mentors with general expertise in that area. The mentoring team will provide guidance
on project development and implementation, supply feedback on manuscripts and grant applications, and give
constructive programmatic feedback on a semi-annual basis. The faculty mentoring program will provide
critical support to facilitate primary project leaders (and pilot grant holders) in submitting successful grant
applications and graduating from the COBRE program. The faculty mentoring program consists of: 1. The
Regional Scientific Network (RSN). It connects EZID with other centers in the region that work in EZID's
mission space. Connections with multiple partners have been established and further network expansion will be
achieved during COBRE Phase I. The RSN will offer opportunities for research workshops, provide access to
various core facilities, and promote collaborative research. 2. The pilot grant program. It will expand the scope
of the research supported by EZID by funding 3 grants annually, including mentoring to promote successful
transition toward extramural funding. 3. Additional components. It includes plans to fund up to 3 seed grants
annually to researchers across the State of Kansas, to recruit two new faculty members at KSU, to host annual
mini-symposia with our RSN partners, to hold an EZID seminar series, to organize individualized writing session,
and to hold training workshops on grant writing, career development, and responsible conduct of research. The
collection of projects, cores, and programs will ensure the establishment of a successful COBRE research center

10912139,"Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Targeted agents have dramatically improved the
prognosis of over 30 cancer types, but are fundamentally limited by the evolution of resistance. Currently,
next generation targeted therapies are retrospectively designed to cover the liabilities of clinically
available targeted therapies. Unfortunately, every investigational compound will have resistance
mutations that prevent complete and durable response. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) has emerged
as a powerful tool for evaluating the mutational landscape of target proteins. DMS screens have recently
been used by academic labs to characterize the resistance landscape of targeted anticancer compounds,
but employ standard next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to measure a highly complex mutant
pool. NGS has a high error rate that prohibits accurate measurements of complex mutational pools.
Duplex Sequencing (DS) is an error correction method that enables the precise measurement of
mutations down to a frequency of 1 in 300,000 in a pooled cell-based library. The Pritchard lab has
developed Deep Mutational Scanning with Duplex Sequencing (DMS-DS) and propose to refine this
technology into a commercially viable service for anticancer pharmaceutical development. In Phase I of
this Small Business Transition Grant, we will harden and scale our DMS-DS technology into an industry-
viable screening platform. In Phase II we will screen all approved BCR-ABL inhibitors, design and build
DMS-DS screens for two lung cancer drug targets, and harden our BCR-ABL DMS-DS platform into a
commercialized end-to-end service. The final product of this SBTG project will be a robust, powerful, and
marketable new research tool ready for use by anticancer pharmaceutical developers. Our company will
leverage this tool (DMS-DS) to expedite lead candidate prioritization and optimize next generation drug
design.
Targeted therapies have revolutionized clinical outcomes for numerous cancers, but acquired resistance
critically limits their long-term utility. Having a commercially available screening platform that can
accurately predict the mutational landscape of next generation therapies will lead to more successful
clinical trials, better targeted therapies, and more effective treatment plans for cancer patients. We firmly
believe our technology will accelerate effective anticancer drug development and that our team is an
unparalleled position to succeed at the commercialization of this product."
10912141,"Abstract
Globally, oral diseases represent a neglected area of research in both the public health and global health
discourse. Oral diseases are largely preventable and treatable, yet affect approximately 3.5 billion people
globally, increasing health and economic burdens while significantly decreasing quality of life. The
populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by oral diseases
highlighting the widespread poverty and inequalities experienced by those least able to access care. Sub
Saharan Africa (SSA) bears 24% of the world’s total burden of infectious diseases that include 69% of the
global HIV disease burden. The oral cavity has played an important role in guiding the management of HIV
based on the effects of HIV on the oral cavity. In LMICs like Uganda there is a need for more efforts to
understand the co-morbidities during long-term Anti-Retroviral Treatments and non-AIDS defining illnesses
that are emerging as significant contributors to morbidity and mortality among adults aging with HIV
disease more so in relation to the oral cavity, the focus of this application. The overall objective of the work
that is proposed in this application is to strengthen the oral health research capacity in Uganda. This work
builds on NIH grants at Makerere University and Uganda Christian University that include the two led by the
PDs (Grant Number: 1R56DE032217, PD Buwembo William, Grant number: 4UH3HL154501, PD Semitala
Fred). The team will work to achieve the overall objective through the following aims: Aim 1: To determine
the current research training needs for HIV oral health personnel in Uganda. Aim 2: To mobilize research
training resources and partners for HIV related oral health research. Aim 3: To prepare a D43 training grant
application to address the identified gaps in Ugandan HIV related oral health research. This effort takes
advantage of the access to large numbers of patients living with HIV and the multi-disciplinary/inter
professional education expertise at MakCHS to increase the oral health research capacity in Uganda. Our
immediate goal is to develop a follow up D43 training program that will support the strengthening of oral
health research through a high-quality oral health research portfolio based on the work of an initial critical
mass of local research scientists. This will align our efforts with those of NIH OAR with regards to research
training of the multidisciplinary workforce required to conduct High Priority HIV/AIDS or HIV/AIDS-related
research."
10914048,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the first half of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic infected nearly 4 million persons in the U.S. and
caused over 150,000 deaths. In the midst of the early phase of this pandemic, people with multiple chronic
conditions (MCC) including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia, which are increasingly common
with age, were left extremely vulnerable to disruptions in healthcare delivery; in New York City (NYC), the first
U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, traditional ambulatory care ceased entirely for several months and
then reopened at only limited capacity. Implementation of telemedicine and modified in-person visits to bridge
this gap was attempted but adopted unevenly, and differential uptake may have worsened existing health
disparities. In this context, the unprecedented pandemic-disruption in ambulatory care in NYC provides a singular
opportunity to study the long-term effects of disasters on health care systems serving health disparity
populations. Our institution, NYU Grossman School of Medicine (NYUGSOM), is uniquely positioned to answer
these questions, having been at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. We have robust existing data
partnerships with the INSIGHT Clinical Research Network, which includes a standardized electronic health
record (EHR) network of 5 NYC academic medical centers, and with the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation
(NYC-H+H), the largest public hospital system in the U.S. We will leverage these 2 sources to determine, among
people age ≥50 with MCCs (≥2 chronic medical conditions), whether patterns of health system engagement
during the acute pandemic disruption phase (3/7/20-7/9/2020) influenced trajectories of 2 chronic diseases
(hypertension and diabetes) at 2 years, risk of cardiovascular events at 4 years, and whether disparities in
engagement exacerbated health inequities. In Aim 1 we will characterize ambulatory healthcare utilization and
quantify disruptions in healthcare services (total disruption vs. delayed care vs. sufficient care) during the acute
pandemic phase, overall and by subgroup (e.g. racial/ethnic minority, economically disadvantaged). In Aim 2 we
will then assess the impact of total disruption and delayed care in healthcare on 2-year trajectories of chronic
disease measures (mean systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c), and in Aim 3 we will measure the impact of
healthcare disruptions on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the 4 years after the acute pandemic period,
and identify their impacts on disparities in CVD outcomes using causal mediation analysis methods. Our findings
will guide future disaster preparedness planning and allow health care systems to develop optimal care models
to mitigate CVD risk and avoid worsening disparities among socioeconomically disadvantaged and/or minority
populations. The MPIs for this project (Dr. Dodson and Dr. Thorpe) combine research experience in
cardiovascular medicine, gerontology, epidemiology, and data science, and are joined by Co-I’s (Dr. Divers, Dr.
Adhikari, Dr. Vedanthan, Dr. Blecker, Dr. Weiner) who bring expertise in health disparities research,
implementation science, biostatistics, and use of EHRs."
10914810,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Septic shock has a mortality rate above 40%, and is treated with supportive care including vasopressors. Yet,
evidence shows vasopressor treatment response and clinician practices are heterogeneous. The key factors
mediating this heterogeneity are unknown. This research project investigates the role of patient-specific factors
in treatment response to initial and adjunctive vasopressor therapy in patients with septic shock. We seek to
develop accurate, individualized tools to predict the heterogeneity of response to a variety of vasopressors in
individual septic shock patients and implement these tools into bedside practice. Our preliminary data show early
initiation of adjunctive vasopressin is associated with lower mortality, and individual patient and treatment
characteristics are associated with vasopressin responsiveness. Therefore, we propose the novel hypothesis
that clinically translatable models are capable of predicting early vasopressor treatment response and will
optimize initial and adjunctive vasopressor therapy to improve clinical outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested
through three interrelated, but independent specific aims: (1) to apply machine learning techniques to predict
initial vasopressor therapy response; (2) to develop a decision model for optimizing adjunctive
vasopressor therapy outcomes; and (3) to identify determinants of successful vasopressor prediction
model clinical translation. Our proposal is innovative in concept because it is the first to use cutting-edge data
science methods to develop prediction models for initial and adjunctive vasopressor treatment effects. The
proposed research is significant because it has the potential to decrease mortality in septic shock patients by
developing and implementing personalized vasopressor treatment approaches. Cleveland Clinic is the ideal
environment to complete the proposed research due to the high volume (>6,000 yearly) of clinically and socio-
demographically diverse sepsis patients, integrated multi-professional treatment and research teams, extensive
informatics infrastructure, large cohesive health-system with a shared electronic health record, and history of
successful evidence translation into improved care delivery. As a critical care clinical pharmacist, Dr. Bauer is
uniquely positioned to develop and implement innovative vasopressor treatment strategies through knowledge
of the combined influences of medication pharmacology and pharmacodynamics, patient comorbidities, and
disease pathophysiology on treatment effects. With the mentorship of Dr. Vidula Vachharajani and other
internationally-recognized experts, Dr. Bauer will pursue training goals to enhance his understanding of applied
clinical translational science, clinical prediction modeling, implementation science, and research leadership.
Pursuit of these aims and training goals through the K08 Career Development Award mechanism will facilitate
achievement of Dr. Bauer’s long-term goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist who improves the
health and outcomes of patients with septic shock through the optimized utilization of vasopressor therapies."

educational resources and training capacity, along with mentorship from core faculty to support postdoctoral
fellows, addiction psychiatry clinical fellows, and junior faculty in their professional growth to become
independent substance use/addiction scientists and clinical researchers. Our program will include a two-level
‘mentoring the mentor’ component where faculty mentors will meet to discuss their mentorship experiences
and coach each other on honing mentorship skills for diverse trainees. Trainees themselves will develop skills
to overcome common barriers to research career growth. Our ASSET program will offer trainees a team of
experienced and diverse mentors, coupled with an internship program with targeted training, research and
funding opportunities focused on substance use and addiction science. Our specific objectives are to: 1.
Develop a short-term (10-week) internship program (ASSET) with interdisciplinary research and career
development training for URM postdoctoral fellows, clinical addiction psychiatry fellows, and junior faculty
(trainees) who aspire to become independent researchers in addiction research; 2.Provide URM trainees with
research knowledge, skills, and mentored career development training to become independent researchers
and leaders in the field of substance use and addiction science, including ‘hard skills’ – manuscript writing, &
grantsmanship to effectively and confidently design and conduct studies on substance use and ‘soft skills’ –
network-building, negotiation, and managing issues commonly faced by URM investigators; 3.Train URM
ASSET trainees in the responsible conduct of research with human subjects, with special consideration given
to working with URM and disadvantaged populations in cross-cultural settings; and 4. Promote URM trainees’
transition to independent research by offering ASSET trainees peer-reviewed developmental ‘seed’ grants and
travel grants for them to gain critical, hands-on, professional experience on formulation of a successful
research proposal and ‘prime the pump’ in substance use research and addiction science."
10914900,"Abstract
HIV-1 infects resident cells of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to neuropathogenesis. HIV-
neuropathogenesis is likely caused by direct and indirect viral and host factors. However, the exact underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in suppressing HIV replication,
near half of people living with HIV (PLWH) still have varying degrees of HIV-associated neurological disorders
(HAND). There is also evidence that the CNS serves as an HIV reservoir and sanctuary site that may allow low
level viremia, contributing to persistent neuroinflammation. The evolving molecular events underlying HIV
neuropathogenesis are difficult to delineate, partially due to the lack of realistic HIV animal models and because
human brain tissues rarely become available for studies until patients die, often due to advanced diseases.
Human brain cortical organoids (BCO) are an emerging, cutting-edge technology for studying neuropathological
disorders; because of their human origin, they better match the genomic and structural features of the developing
human brain compared to animal models. This model consists of a self-assembled dynamic 3-D structure that
provides an interplay of different cell types, which is limited in traditional monolayer cultures. We optimized
protocols to generate long-term viable and functional BCO. Our BCO model has an unprecedented cell type
diversity, via a dynamic development from progenitor cells to neuronal cells, that become interspersed with
quiescent astrocytes over time; a difficult phenotype to obtain ex vivo. With the cellular components for
generation of a functional neural network in place, our BCO model shows a robust extracellular electrical activity
at early stages and progressively develops into an organized oscillatory network. Additionally, we have
previously established methods for integration of iPSC-derived microglia into the BCO forming an assembloid,
which is crucial tor this study. A BCO assembloid model containing relevant immune cell types will enable
susceptibility to HIV and the study of the contributions of different cell types to the neurological consequences of
infection. Using this robust and functional BCO assembloid, we propose to develop a new human model to study
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HIV neuropathogenesis, and the potential interactive,
additive, or synergistic effects of antiretroviral treatment (ART) and opioid exposure. This microglia-infused BCO
with endogenous astrocytes will allow HIV infection and its related pathophysiological events and help to
disentangle the contribution and interplay of relevant immune cells to neuropathogenesis."
10914903,"Mechanism of Msp1 Mediated Protein Extraction from the Mitochondrial Membrane
As the center for oxidative phosphorylation and apoptotic regulation, mitochondria play a vital role in human
health. Proper mitochondrial function depends on a robust quality control system to maintain homeostasis of
the proteome (proteostasis). Declines in mitochondrial function and/or proteostasis have been linked to cancer,
aging, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. A poorly understood aspect of mitochondrial
proteostasis is the removal of membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer. This is due to the technical challenges
of reconstituting this process in vitro. We have overcome this technical barrier by developing a simple, but
powerful reconstituted system with the AAA+ (ATPase Associated with cellular Activities) protein Msp1.
Anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), Msp1 maintains mitochondrial proteostasis by
removing unwanted proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mutations in Msp1 or the human homologue ATAD1 lead to
compromised mitochondrial function, impaired fear conditioning, severe encephalopathy, and early death.
Despite its clear physiological importance, there are many important unanswered questions regarding Msp1
activity. How does Msp1 interact with other quality control components to maintain membrane proteostasis?
What is the full range of substrates extracted by Msp1/ATAD1? How is this regulated? These are particularly
pressing questions given that our collaborator, Jared Rutter (HHMI, University of Utah), has preliminary genetic
evidence that ATAD1 may regulate apoptosis by extracting BH3-only proteins from the OMM. We will use an
unbiased proteomic approach and our in vitro extraction assay to directly test this paradigm shifting hypothesis
and examine the molecular details for how this process is regulated. Because our reconstituted system
overcomes key technical barriers that have hampered previous attempts to study the extraction of membrane
proteins from a lipid bilayer, we will also utilize our system to draw foundational conclusions about how key
factors such as membrane fluidity, substrate structure, and ATP hydrolysis rates affect this essential cellular
process. This work will test an exciting new hypothesis for apoptotic regulation, provide a comprehensive
picture of Msp1/ATAD1 function in mitochondrial biology, and uncover new insights into the fundamental

can help address is early detection of cognitive and physical decline, and tracking integration of new, healthy
brain behaviors into everyday life. The long-term goal for Adaptelligence LLC is to commercialize a smartwatch
app, called AcTelligence, to assess a person's cognitive and physical health and to promote healthy brain
behavior. The objective of this application is to perform research a development to refine and commercialize a
smartwatch app that offers capabilities to detect activities of daily living from smartwatch sensors, extract
digital behavior markers from activity-labeled sensor data, predict clinical health measures from behavior
markers, and provide user feedback in the form of health status and healthy-behavior prompts. This technology
is unique because we consider a person's entire behavior profile and introduce machine learning methods to
robustly predict clinical measures from this information. We utilize a popular smartwatch platform to increase
accessibility and balance continuous assessment with opportunities to extend and improve health. Building on
our successful Phase I effort, our approach is to extract activity-aware digital behavior markers from
smartwatch sensor data (Aim 1), automate health assessment based on these markers (Aim 2), and perform
participatory design of a web dashboard that provides visual analytics and alerts for brain health (Aim 3). We
will validate the sensing and machine learning technologies for a sample of 100 older adults and will refine the
interactive analytics through multiple rounds of participatory design with 18 participants. The app will be
brought to market through a thorough market analysis and a strategically-designed commercialization plan.
The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on cognitive and physical health
revealed within a person's everyday environment that promote early detection of cognitive and physical decline
that can lead to more effective treatment. This work is important because of the increasing number of older
individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore,
the work addresses the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own
homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs."

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintains homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) chemical
environment, and is critical for proper neural function; BBB breakdown has been implicated in neurodegenerative
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. The BBB is also a huge obstacle for drug
delivery to the brain. For both of these reasons, we need a better understanding of the molecular regulators of
BBB development and function. This K99/R00 proposal will support the PI, Dr. Natasha O’Brown, in developing
innovative strategies and acquiring new skill sets to study the signaling between neurovascular cells and blood
vessels involved in establishing BBB function. The experiments will be initiated during the mentored period
(carried out in Dr. Sean Megason’s lab at Harvard Medical School) and continue in the PI’s own laboratory upon
obtaining an independent position. Dr. O’Brown’s long-term career goal is to unravel the cellular and molecular
interactions that direct BBB development and maintenance, with the hope of identifying new targets for
therapeutic drug delivery into the brain.
Dr. O’Brown’s previous work identified a novel zebrafish mutant with vastly increased BBB permeability. The
leaky phenotype mapped to a missense mutation in the neuronally-produced secreted proteoglycan Spock1.
Spock1 is the first identified neuronal factor that establishes BBB properties, and it therefore represents a huge
opportunity to learn more about how endothelial cell permeability is regulated by the CNS microenvironment.
Aim 1 will use zebrafish genetics, cell transplantation and tracer leakage assays to perturb and assess Spock1’s
function in regulating BBB properties. Aim 2 will use a combination of lineage tracing, live imaging and RNA
sequencing to characterize how loss of Spock1 alters CNS cellular interactions leading to increased BBB
leakage. Finally, Aim 3 will establish a connection between BBB dysfunction and altered behavior, generating a
new platform for a small molecule screen to identify novel molecules that alter BBB function. The discovery of
novel molecular regulators of BBB function will form the foundation of Dr. O’Brown’s independent laboratory.
Dr. O’Brown’s extensive training in developmental biology and genetics makes her an ideal candidate to further
develop this important research area. Building on this training, she will develop expertise in zebrafish genetic
and cellular manipulations, 4D high-resolution live imaging and analysis, and in performing and analyzing
behavioral drug screens. She will be mentored throughout the K99 period by Drs. Sean Megason, Leonard Zon,
Chenghua Gu and Randall Peterson, world-class experts in zebrafish development and quantitative imaging,
zebrafish genetics and genomics, BBB physiology and small molecule screens. Together, the proposed
experiments and training will position Dr. O’Brown to be an excellent candidate for independent faculty positions,
and for a leadership role in research into the cellular and molecular control of BBB development and function."
10914781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite recent progresses in mechanobiology research, there is still a fundamental knowledge gap in critical
cellular functions and molecular mechanisms, which take place between the molecular and cellular scale. For
systematic, quantitative and deterministic studies, there are key challenges to achieve single-molecule precision,
heteromolecular control, simultaneous and independent modulation of multiple physicochemical cues. Based on
our unique approach combining top-down nanotechnology and bottom-up synthetic biology, we will overcome
these challenges and create “smart” cell interfaces which could probe, sense and manipulate cells and the
microenvironment, in an unparalleled precise and controllable manner. The overarching goal of my laboratory is
to bring molecular insights into cell biology, and advance the knowledge of cell as a machine, whose behaviors
and functions can be predicted and directed.
Based on our discoveries in geometric underpinning of molecular mechanobiology, we will address three
outstanding questions: (i) What underlies the spatial effects in receptor clustering, and how are they force-
mediated? (ii) Are there heteromolecular spatial effects in co-clustering and segregation of different receptors,
and what are their roles in signaling crosstalk and integration? (iii) How to use the new knowledge in molecular
mechanisms and effectively direct cell functions? Considering the interplay and crosstalk between multiple
receptors and physicochemical cues, we will reveal the underlying synergistic mechanisms of heteromolecular
mechanobiology for cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling (fibroblast as a model) and cell-cell signaling (T cell
as a model). Specifically, for cell-ECM signaling, we will investigate the integrin clustering mechanism, its
relationship with cellular contractility, and the crosstalk between growth factor receptors and integrins. For cell-
cell juxtacrine signaling, we will investigate the synergistic mechanism of mechanosensing and spatial sensing
in T cell receptor clustering and triggering, and the heteromolecular co-clustering mechanism between activatory
and inhibitory receptors. Finally, the artificial ECM and artificial cell surfaces we developed in this research will
be used to direct critical cell functions for in vitro cell engineering and manufacturing, as well as potential in vivo
applications.
Overall, our technology will break the limit of mechanobiology study with a single type of bioligands on 2D, rigid,
static surfaces, provide heteromolecular control over multiple ligands in a 3D, soft, dynamic fashion, and
therefore better mimic the complex in vivo environment. This transformative methodology can be customized
and adopted in distinct systems to expand our understanding of fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms,
and apply the new knowledge for novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods."

DNA methylation dynamics in mammals are an integral component of the epigenetic regulatory machinery.
Methylated DNA functions as a repressive mark for gene expression and essential for cell fate determination
during embryonic development. In adult tissues, DNA methylation at specific genomic loci is essential for the
maintenance of cellular identity and function. Changes of DNA methylation profiles in intestinal epithelial cells
(IECs) were observed upon colonization by commensal microbiota. However, how environmental cues including
the microbiota, enteric pathogens and chemical stressors affect DNA methylation patterns in the intestinal
epithelia, remains largely unclear. DNA methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases targeting cytosine
at the 5th carbon position resulting in 5-methylcytosine (5mC). DNA methylation can be actively removed via
successive DNA oxidations of 5mC into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-
carboxylcytosine (5caC) catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of DNA dioxygenases, TET1,
TET2 and TET3. Both 5fC and 5caC can be excised by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) as part of the DNA
base-excision repair mechanism resulting in unmodified cytosines. Both TET and TDG have been associated
with high risk of intestinal bowel disease development. However, the role of TET-mediated DNA oxidations in
intestinal epithelial physiology remains unexplored. We find that TET3 protects IECs against pro-inflammatory
stressors including the enteric pathogen Salmonella typhimurium and the chemical-induced colitis model dextran
sodium sulfate (DSS). We identified a TET3-dependent reprogramming of gene expression profiles in IECs in
response to pro-inflammatory luminal stressors resulting in the upregulation of genes involved in Wnt and Notch
signaling pathways. TET activity depends on the metabolite -ketoglutarate (KG) to oxidize 5mC into 5hmC,
5fC and 5caC. We hypothesize that in response to luminal signals such as KG, TET3-mediated DNA oxidations
act as integral epigenetic and transcriptional regulators to maintain IEC homeostasis and protect from luminal
stressors. Mechanistically, we propose a distribution of labor among TET-mediated DNA oxidations whereby 5fC
and 5caC, whose levels are dynamically regulated by TETs and TDG, promote transcriptional pausing of stress-
responsive genes involved in epithelial repair and innate defense programs, whose transcriptional pausing state
may be released by TDG-mediated excision of 5fC/5caC followed by enrichment of 5hmC levels. To address this
hypothesis, we generated mouse models with Tet3 specific deletion in IECs, Paneth cells or intestinal stem cells.
We will implement diverse genome wide approaches to decipher gene networks whose expression is regulated
by TET3-mediated DNA oxidations affecting transcriptional pausing in response to commensal microbiota and
luminal stressors. This project is innovative because it will decipher the epigenetic and transcriptional
mechanisms that are dependent on the KG-TET-TDG axis to maintain homeostasis and protect the intestinal
epithelial lining against pro-inflammatory conditions."

There is an urgent need to develop non-sputum biomarker-based triage and diagnostic tests for childhood
tuberculosis (TB). This is particularly important for young children with HIV infection, who have high TB-related
mortality but often cannot produce sputum and have lower sputum bacillary burden. Biomarker discovery for
childhood TB requires ultra-sensitive platforms to measure low-abundant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
proteins in clinical samples and greater investigation of host proteins, post-translational modifications of proteins,
and metabolites that are more likely than upstream RNA expression to reflect the host-pathogen interactions that
lead to TB disease. The overall objective of the proposed project is to identify Mtb- and/or host-derived
biosignatures in children that can achieve World Health Organization (WHO) target product profile (TPP)
accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum biomarker-based triage or diagnostic test for childhood TB. We
hypothesize that biosignatures that combine Mtb proteins and host biomarkers with evidence of functional
relevance to TB pathogenesis or immunity will have the best diagnostic performance. To assess this hypothesis,
we will conduct biomarker discovery and initial clinical validation studies using samples from three well-
characterized pediatric TB cohorts in Uganda, The Gambia and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will use an ultra-
sensitive electrochemoluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassay to assess the presence of Mtb proteins ESAT-
6, CFP-10, MPT64, MPT32, and Ag85B in a discovery set of banked blood and urine samples from 100 children
under 5 years old with confirmed TB and 200 with unlikely TB per NIH consensus definitions (50% HIV
prevalence in both groups). In Aim 2, we will use the same discovery set to perform targeted and untargeted
mass spectrometry with functional assessment through pathway analysis, in vitro models and in vivo mouse
models to identify host proteins, post-translational modifications and metabolites that distinguish children with
confirmed versus unlikely TB. In Aim 3, we will use the candidate Mtb and host biomarkers identified in Aims 1
and 2 to derive biosignatures with up to 10 analytes consisting of Mtb proteins only, host biomarkers only, and
both Mtb- and host-derived biomarkers. Biosignatures that meet WHO TPP criteria in the discovery set will 1) be
evaluated in an independent test set of banked samples from 300 children under 5 years old (100 with confirmed
TB, 200 with unlikely TB; 50% HIV prevalence in each group) to verify diagnostic accuracy and establish cut-
offs and 2) be evaluated in a prospective cohort of 350 children under 5 years old using the pre-select cut-offs
and both microbiological and clinical reference standards. Completion of these aims will result in identification of
promising biosignatures that can be further validated in large-scale field studies and translated into point-of-care
triage and/or diagnostic tests for childhood TB."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a serious condition with severe medical and societal consequences.There has
been little progress in medical treatment over the past decades. We are taking a translational approach and have
established an animal model, where alcohol-dependent rats in various stages of abstinence are subjects of
investigation. The neuronal target is the opioid systems and the opponent hypothesis. We propose that the initial
euphoric effects are channeled through the enkephalin/mu-opioid receptor (MOP) and the later developing
negative reinforcement (craving) is related to activity at the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor (KOP). In fact, the
MOP antagonist, naltrexone is a FDA-approved agent with indication to reduce relapse. KOP antagonists are
entering clinical trials in different neuropsychiatric conditions. We have chosen CERC-501 as index drug, being
reversible and apparently well tolerated in clinical examination. After behavioral recordings, brain specimens will
be dissected and form a “brain bank” for further analysis. A focus of interest is the central nucleus of the amygdala
(CeA), and the circuitry presenting MOP and/or KOP. Selected specimens will undergo superresolution
microscopy (quantitative Single Molecule Localization Microscopy, qSMLM). A pilot study showed that already
an acute dose of EtOH disrupts localization of MOP and KOP, an effect blocked by naltrexone. How EtOH affects
receptor mobility in the plasma membrane, receptor clustering (homo- and hetero-dimers) and association with
protein- and lipid-rich membrane domains will be studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). As
with qSMLM resolution is achieved at the single-molecule level. Both technologies will be used to study co-
localization of receptors with proteins of relevance for the signaling cascade. We hypothesize that EtOH perturbs
the dynamic selforganization of signaling domains harboring MOPs and KOPs, that distinct alterations in
mechanisms controlling MOP vs KOP organization develop during chronic EtOH exposure. With OP antagonists
innate MOP and KOP signaling complexes are stabilized at the nanoscale level. Focused studies of these
mechanisms will provide critical new insight into molecular mechanisms through which EtOH-induced receptor
disruptions may be prevented or reversed. The commensurate importance of the two opioid systems may vary
between individuals and influence the choice of personalized therapy with OP antagonists. Studies will include
the N40D MOP genotype known to affect the behavioral phenotype and sensitivity to naltrexone."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication associated with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
Approximately 25% of patients with diabetes develop DKD. DKD is the leading cause of kidney failure and
accounts for 44% of all end-stage renal disease cases. It is associated with heart disease and heart failure,
stroke, and early death. Treatment options for DKD are limited and focus on slowing progression to end-stage
renal disease through glycemic control. Current FDA-approved treatments do not address pathogenic
mechanisms driving the disease.
The pathophysiology of DKD is related to prolonged exposure to high blood sugar, leading to non-specific
glycation of proteins and subsequent formation of toxic advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Evidence
suggests that accumulation of AGEs in the kidneys plays a role in the vascular complications associated with
diabetes, including DKD. Revel Pharmaceuticals is developing a novel class of therapeutics designed to cleave
one of the most abundant AGEs accumulating in DKD, carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), thus removing a
significant driver of DKD. Using rational design approaches, we have engineered enzymes that cleave free
CML and CML modified peptides.
Our goal in this Phase I grant is to optimize lead drug candidates and demonstrate enzyme activity on
physiologically relevant DKD substrates. Our specific aims are to (1) engineer CML oxidase to efficiently cleave
CML modifications from physiological substrates (2) characterize CML oxidase activity on model proteins &
human tissues. Successful completion of this Phase I SBIR project will yield the first therapeutic enzyme
designed to remove and repair AGE damage in vivo. In Phase II, we will carry out in vivo efficacy and
IND-enabling studies with our collaborators at the National Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center to support an
IND submission."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases and has a rapidly rising
incidence and prevalence. Management of blood glucose is challenging and often leads to frequent and rapid
swings between normal, high, and low glucose. This glucose variability has recently been identified as an
independent risk factor for diabetic complications. One of the least studied and understood complications of
T1D is altered cognition and its relationship to glucose variability. As the brain uses a substantial amount of the
body’s glucose to support its functions, especially during dynamic periods of brain development, there are
strong biological reasons for the potential vulnerability of youth with T1D. Several studies have shown lower
cognitive scores in youth with T1D compared to their peers without T1D, and shown that poorer overall
glycemic control as indicated by severe glycemic events (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) and chronic
hyperglycemia, are associated with lower cognitive scores both acutely and long-term. However, these studies
we conducted in a controlled, optimized laboratory settings at a single time point. Little is still known about how
typical glucose fluctuations that occur daily in real-life settings affect cognitive function in the moment,
particularly dynamic cognitive skills that are sensitive to environmental or physical conditions of the individual
(e.g. sleep deprivation) and thus fluctuate throughout the day (e.g., working memory, processing speed).
Determining the relationship between glycemic fluctuations and dynamic cognitive function is critically
important in youth given that dynamic cognitive skills are fundamental for learning, integrating, and
using novel information in their daily lives. Understanding how these skills are affected in daily life, how
they relate to glycemic fluctuations, and any contributing factors, could motivate improvements in academic
accommodations and T1D treatment recommendations. Importantly, this work could also be expanded to
better understand the impact of glycemic variability on brain health throughout the lifespan in T1D and could be
translated to other forms of diabetes (e.g., type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes). The primary goal of this study
is to determine if real-time, real-life glycemic variability predicts fluctuations in dynamic cognitive function in
youth with T1D. A secondary goal is to determine whether dynamic cognitive function in youth with T1D differs
from youth without T1D, independent of significant glycemic extremes. To address these questions, I will apply
a unique and innovative combination of continuous health and cognitive data collection methods, multivariate
time-series analyses, and machine learning models. This work, combined with a tailored career development
plan, will form the basis of my future work as an independent investigator, which will expand to address how
diabetes-related health behaviors (e.g., food choice) impact glucose fluctuations, and subsequent brain health
(i.e., cognitive function), using novel mobile health (mHealth) technologies across different types of diabetes."

Maternal obesity during pregnancy increases the risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes and abnormalities in
fetal growth with higher infant birth weight and BMI in both early and late childhood. Extensive literature provides
evidence for epigenetic programming of the developing fetus in response to the maternal metabolic milieu, but
there is minimal direct evidence that changes in the fetal environment can alter the epigenome. The proposed
study will test the hypothesis that significant weight loss prior to conception will improve the intrauterine metabolic
environment as reflected in the maternal metabolome and inflammation-related proteome and result in changes
in methylation patterns in cord blood leukocytes. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. Aim
1, will examine the metabolic intrauterine environment in 300 obese women (BMI>30 kg/m2 ≤ 45 kg/m2) who
will be randomized to either Very Low Energy Diet (VLED) targeting a >15% body weight loss or Standard of
Care (SOC) interventions. Along with 120 lean women (LEAN) serving as comparators, VLED and SOC women
will undergo extensive prepregnancy clinical and physiological phenotyping and blood collections. Obese women
will undergo additional phenotyping after weight loss and all women will have additional testing at each trimester.
We expect 87 offspring in each group. Fetal growth will be assessed by ultrasound and offspring birth weight
(Ponderal index), adiposity (Pea Pod Air Displacement Plethysmography). In Aim 2, plasma metabolomics and
(hybrid targeted/untargeted and lipidomics) and inflammatory markers will be used to assess intervention
associated changes in VLED and SOC women and compared to VLED women. To assess the intrauterine
environment, metabolomic profiles and inflammatory proteome will be measured in the first trimester and at term
in all mothers and in fetal cord blood. Multivariate computational models will assess the association of maternal
and neonate metabolome and inflammatory markers to fetal growth and newborn weight and adiposity. In Aim
3, DNA methylation patterns and RNA-seq will be obtained from fetal cord blood lymphocytes of all offspring.
Differences in methylation patterns between VLED, SOC and LEAN will be assessed and changes in mRNA
levels will be determined to assess the effect of methylation on gene expression. Multivariate analysis of
methylation patterns will be related to the metabolome and to fetal growth and birth outcomes. Using sparse
multivariate factor analysis regression model (smFARM) and other statistical approaches, we will determine how
the maternal metabolome and proteome is associated with cord blood DNA methylation and investigate whether
fetal growth or birth weight and other outcomes are mediated by specific metabolites. The results of these studies
will provide the first prospective assessment of the benefit of preconception weight loss on the intrauterine
environment and molecular changes in the newborn and will provide a potential pathway from maternal
intrauterine environment and programmed changes in weight and metabolic status in offspring."

Inadequate diversity in clinical trials is widely recognized as a significant contributing factor to health disparities
experienced by racial/ethnic minorities and other diverse populations in the US. This lack of parity calls for urgent
initiatives aimed at increasing diversity in order to support more equitable representation in clinical research and
bring the benefits of advances in healthcare forged by clinical research equitably to all. National Cancer Institute
(NCI) supported clinical trials (CTs) are key drivers of innovations in cancer care; however racial/ethnic
minorities, and Black and Latino populations in particular, are underrepresented in NCI-supported CTs and thus
not able to fully benefit from cutting edge treatments and precision medicine. CT participation among Black and
Latino populations continues to fall short and the multitude of structural, clinical, physician, and patient barriers
warrant multilevel interventions to enhance referral and enrollment of Black and Latino patients to NCI-supported
CTs. The ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (EA), as an NCORP Research Base, has engaged community
providers and researchers through a robust research portfolio that spans Cancer Control, Cancer Prevention,
and Cancer Care Delivery. We propose to leverage the collective resources of the EA, our team’s decades of
work on improving diversity in clinical trials, and our foundational work in patient navigation and CT research
literacy tools to create and evaluate an ECOG-ACRIN Trial SUPPORT Toolkit (SUPPORT intervention) that aims
to improve Black and Latino referral and enrollment in active NCI-supported therapeutic trials in head and neck,
thoracic, and genitourinary cancers, and leukemia and myeloma. The multilevel EA SUPPORT intervention
consists of a CT research literacy tool and CT Resource Navigators based at EA who will interface with patients,
providers, and community oncology site staff to improve referral and enrollment of Black and Latino patients to
CTs. Our specific aims are to: 1) Conduct preliminary assessments and refine the EA SUPPORT intervention
with focus on community representation and input. 2) Conduct a Hybrid Type 1 cluster-randomized, roll-out
effectiveness-implementation trial in 10 NCORP community oncology practice sites (with N= 500 Black and
Latino patients with cancer) to evaluate the effectiveness of the EA SUPPORT intervention in improving Black
and Latino patient referral and enrollment to NCI-supported CTs (primary outcomes) and participant and provider
awareness and knowledge of CTs (secondary outcomes) while assessing implementation factors. 3) With the
CUSP2CT Data, Evaluation, and Coordinating Center, conduct final site evaluation and disseminate the
SUPPORT intervention to NCORP community oncology sites, research bases, and affiliated trial networks. Our
collaborative infrastructure and EA SUPPORT multilevel intervention will shift the current clinical trial research
base referral and enrollment paradigm and directly remove multiple levels of barriers through innovations in CT
navigation and CT research literacy tools."

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in some individuals as a sequela to indirect stress
on the lung from systemic infection (sepsis/endotoxemia). However, it is unclear why only some patients with
sepsis develop ARDS. One possible risk factor leading to ARDS in patients with sepsis is exposure to air
pollutants such as ozone. Recently, FDA acceptable environmental levels of ozone exposure have been
directly linked to the development of ARDS. Our overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the
increased risk of developing ARDS following exposure to oxidants such as ozone. ARDS develops, in part,
due to an accumulation of dead and dying neutrophils and neutrophil-derived proinflammatory apoptotic bodies
in the lung. Under homeostatic conditions, these are removed by macrophages via a process known as
efferocytosis. We hypothesize that the increased risk of ARDS following ozone exposure is due impaired
efferocytosis. Moreover, this is exacerbated in individuals with genetic deficits in the pulmonary collectin,
surfactant protein D (SPD), which controls macrophage efferocytosis. To test this, we developed a novel
experimental model in which mice are exposed to inhaled ozone followed by intravenous (i.v.)
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial-derived toxin released into the blood during sepsis (endotoxemia). Our
aims are to (1) Determine if ozone exposure and decreased SPD activity exacerbate inflammation and acute
lung injury (ALI) by impairing macrophage efferocytosis and (2) Determine if decreased SPD activity
exacerbates ozone-induced impairment of macrophage efferocytosis in humans. Wild type and lung-specific
conditional SPD knock out mice will be treated with ozone followed by LPS. Macrophage efferocytosis will be
measured by flow cytometry. The mechanistic pathways associated with oxidative stress, which is important in
ozone toxicity, will be identified using RNA sequencing (RNAseq). We will analyze lung inflammation and
macrophage efferocytosis in human subjects, stratified according to single nucleotide polymorphisms within the
SPD gene, following controlled ozone exposure. The results of these experiments will provide novel
mechanistic insights into the relationship between ozone exposure, macrophage function, SPD variation, and
susceptibility to ARDS. These studies are significant, as oxidants such as ozone have been implicated as a
risk factor the development of ARDS. The experiments, coursework, and structured mentorship proposed in
this application will provide the basis for an NIH R01 grant and initiate the PI's career in independent
translational research."

 Developmental exposure to heavy metals, such as lead (Pb), causes systematic damage to the central
nervous system and impairs many neurological targets. Some of these biological perturbations, such as altered
synaptic plasticity and endosome trafficking, are shared with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Epigenetic mechanisms,
given potency and latency in gene regulation, offer a plausible route to relay impacts from early-life environmental
exposure events to AD. The exact molecular mechanism, however, remains elusive. The goal of this proposal is
to define the epigenetic mechanism contributing to altered synaptic plasticity arising from developmental Pb
exposure addressing the contributions of gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions in accelerating the
progression of AD. Our preliminary studies and prior literature suggest persistent alterations in synaptic plasticity,
primarily arising from changes in glutamate receptors, including NMDAR and AMPAR. Alterations in endosomal
trafficking are also heavily implied. We formulated our central hypothesis that developmental Pb exposure alters
the transcription of glutamate receptors via epigenetic regulation affecting synaptic plasticity with the effects
exacerbated when coupled with the AD genetic risk factor, SORL1. This GxE interaction compromises
endosomal trafficking and glutamate receptor recycling, which eventually leads to the onset of an AD-like
phenotype manifested by protein aggregation markers. We adopted a multiplex model including cortical neurons
derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and a zebrafish animal model with and without a
known late-onset AD (LOAD) risk factor (SORL1). We designed our experiments to dissect contributions from
environmental (E), genetic (G), and GxE driven events in altering synaptic plasticity and the manifestation of AD-
like phenotypes. We will test our hypothesis in three aims. Aim 1 will elucidate the impact of developmental Pb
exposure and SORL1 effects on neuron susceptibility of protein aggregates. Aim 2 will reveal the molecular
origin conferring developmental Pb neurotoxicity to an AD-like phenotype. Aim 3 will define subcellular alterations
in the post-synapse associated with an AD-like phenotype. Collectively, we will curate time-dependent
information about molecular changes in the transcriptome and epigenome, along with alterations in ultrastructure
of post-synaptic spine. We will use the aggregated information to infer causative relations among different events
by assuming early events are likely to drive late ones. We expect that GxE interactions arising from
developmental Pb exposure and SORL1 mutation to induce a phenotype closely resembling AD, followed by
SORL1 mutation only, Pb exposure in wild type, and untreated wild type. Furthermore, we will reveal novel
targets mediating the latent effects of developmental Pb exposure on neurodegeneration risks via mining of our
dataset and verification of the efficacy of underlying epigenetic profiles of glutamate receptors in accelerating
AD onset and progression risks. The knowledge generated will enlighten the molecular mechanism of Pb
neurotoxcity and connections of early life Pb exposure to AD progression addressing goals of PAR-22-048."

 Older African Americans—especially those with lower income and those living in urban neighborhoods—
have a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to the general population. This health disparity is
attributable, in part, to modifiable factors including insufficient levels of aerobic exercise. However, not
everyone gains the same degree of neuroprotection from exercise. For the proposed project, we plan to
investigate genetic risk as a novel source of response heterogeneity to exercise interventions in African
Americans. Previously, we demonstrated that five months of twice-weekly cardio-dance exercise can
increase the dynamic rearrangement (or “neural flexibility”) of resting-state networks within the medial
temporal lobe (MTL), one of the earliest brain regions impacted by AD. Moreover, this improved neural
flexibility mediates intervention-related improvements in generalization, the ability to apply past learning to
novel task demands. Given our earlier findings that generalization is impaired in preclinical AD, these results
suggest a novel circuit-level mechanism, MTL neural flexibility, through which exercise may reduce risk for
dementia. Moreover, we discovered that the cognitive benefits of exercise in older African Americans are
diminished in those with a risk variant of the ABCA7 (rs3764650) gene. Two key limitations to our previous
exercise studies were: (1) interventions limited to two 60-minute classes/week, below the recommended 150
minutes/week, and (2) too few participants to evaluate the effect of ABCA7 on exercise-induced changes on
neural flexibility. We propose to recruit 280 sedentary older African Americans, ages 60 and above, to be
randomized to one of two equally engaging six-month interventions, a Cardio Dance Fitness (CDF)
intervention, and a Strength, Flexibility, & Balance active control. All participants will undergo—at enrollment
and post-intervention—health assessments, cognitive tests, and structural and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), and a blood-draw to assess amyloid (A𝛽 42/40) and tau (p-tau231, p-tau181). This
will enable us to test: 1) the effect of the CDF intervention on a cognitive marker of AD risk, generalization; 2)
the effect of the CDF intervention on a fMRI biomarker of AD, neural flexibility, and determine whether
improvements in neural flexibility mediate improvements in generalization; and 3) whether ABCA7 genotypic
variations moderate the efficacy of the CDF intervention for reducing AD risk. Impact: This work lays the
