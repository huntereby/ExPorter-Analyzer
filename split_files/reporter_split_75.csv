11067388,"Summary
Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the presence of a proportion of hematopoietic cells carrying a somatic mutation
that arise from a common hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell (HSPC). CH increases with aging and is an
independent risk factor for hematologic malignancy as well as cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in
the general population. People living with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk for many age-related comorbidities
including cancer and CH is of emerging interest in this population as a potential prognostic biomarker. Several
studies have identified a higher prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) in PWH
compared to non-HIV matched comparators. For PWH, the intersection of genomic alterations with the persistent
immune activation and inflammation characteristic of HIV infection posits a complex interplay that may accelerate
aging processes and predispose individuals to age-related diseases at a higher rate than the general population.
Given that PWH are at higher risk of CHIP, we propose to investigate whether CHIP could be mediating both
accelerated biological aging and downstream cancer events. We hypothesize that PWH will have a higher
prevalence both CHIP and methylation markers of aging than matched controls and that both will be independent
risk factors for incident malignancy in PWH. Here we propose to (1) compare the prevalence of CHIP by HIV
status in a health system-based cohort, (2) compare epigenetic age in a large cohort by HIV status and presence
of CHIP and (3) to assess the effect of CHIP and biomarkers of aging on aging on cancer incidence and outcomes
in PWH. This work will elucidate the potential interplay between CH, aging and cancer in PWH and facilitate the
establishment of CH as a biomarker for potential preventive intervention within this population."

VHA about: 1) the prevalence (and incidence) of post-colonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC) in Veterans; 2)
determine whether and the extent to which patient outcomes are affected relative to detected colorectal cancer
(DCRC); 3) identify patient-, endoscopist-, and facility- / system-specific factors associated with PCCRC, in
patients who do and who do not have one or more index polyps identified and removed. Identifying remediable
factors associated with PCCRC will lead to interventions to improve colonoscopy performance and adherence
to appropriate surveillance intervals, aligning with recent VHA directives for high-quality colonoscopy.
Deployment of these interventions will help ensure that Veterans receive colonoscopy of the highest quality.
BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) that occurs after a colonoscopy showing no CRC but prior to the
recommended interval for follow-up colonoscopy is referred to as “post-colonoscopy CRC” (PCCRC). PCCRC
results from missed colorectal lesions, incompletely resected lesions, or from de novo, fast-growing lesions. A
robust, but heterogeneous literature shows that 3-9% of all CRCs are ICCs. More limited studies show an
inconsistent effect of PCCRC on patient outcomes as compared to DCRC, and attribute PCCRC to specific
colonoscopy-related factors and to polyp characteristics. As the prevalence of PCCRC, its associated factors,
and effect on patient outcomes have not been well-studied within VHA, we propose the following specific aims:
PROJECT AIMS: 1) Quantify the a) prevalence and incidence, and b) outcomes of PCCRC in Veterans, as
compared with DCRC; 2) Assess the role of colonoscopy-related factors, polyp characteristics, patient factors,
and facility factors for the risk for CRC after colonoscopy a) with polypectomy, and; b) without polypectomy
METHODS: Using VA electronic databases (VA Central Cancer Registry, Corporate Data Warehouse, VA-
CMS data repository, VA Informatics and Computer Infrastructure, VA Vital Status File, and others), we will
perform a retrospective cross-sectional study (for prevalence), a retrospective cohort study (for incidence and
outcomes) and nested case-control studies (to identify risk factors). The retrospective cross-sectional study will
quantify prevalence of PCCRC, using definitions consistent with the published literature and experience from
other large healthcare systems in order to facilitate comparison of PCCRC prevalence with those other
systems for the interval 1/1/06-12/31/2011. From all patients undergoing colonoscopy during this interval, we
will calculate PCCRC incidence for Veterans with non-advanced neoplasia and no neoplasia for whom a 5-
year and 10-year surveillance / rescreening interval, respectively, is recommended. Incidence and prevalence
estimates will be adjusted for diagnostic-error rates, which will be based on manual medical record review. We
will conduct a retrospective cohort study to compare Veterans aged 50-85 years diagnosed with PCCRC to
those diagnosed with DCRC between 1/1/2006 and 12/31/2011, examining the primary outcome of 5-year
overall survival and secondary outcomes of urgent hospitalization, disease stage, surgery, and 30-day post-
operative mortality. Multivariate analysis will include adjustment for covariates including age, sex, rurality,
comorbidity, and cancer site. For all CRC diagnosed between 2004 and 2011, we will use a case-control study
(CCS) design to identify risk factors for PCCRC among Veterans ages 50-85 years who did or did not have
polypectomy. Cases will be Veterans with PCCRC either following polypectomy (CCS-1) or not (CCS-2). For
both CCSs, controls will be Veterans who do not have PCCRC during the same timeframe as that of the cases.
Exposure variables will be procedure-related (extent of exam, preparation quality, others), endoscopist-related
(specialty, level of training, others), and institution-related (volume, mechanisms for ensuring follow-up,
complexity, others). Odds ratios and attributable (etiologic) fractions will be derived using multiple logistic
regression and Greenland’s method for logistic regression, respectively."

Hearing loss is a major and growing public health concern, especially in low and middle income countries
(LMICs) where about 80% of the world’s population with hearing loss reside. Our vision is to provide good
quality, affordable, and sustainable hearing health care to underserved populations in LMICs and around the
world. We propose to validate and then trial an innovative mHealth model for end-to-end hearing care
facilitated by community health workers (CHWs). The smartphone-based solution uses hearing aids to first test
hearing and then, if needed, programs the devices to provide gold standard rehabilitation. In the course of
fifteen minutes, the user and their family should be able to experience a step change in their communicative
ability. Following the fitting session, support will continue through innovative mHealth messaging support for
their new hearing aids and communication with the CHW for troubleshooting. In the R21 phase of this funding,
we will address three aims that validate key steps on the journey to better hearing for all. For Aim 1, we will
perform clinical work in Cincinnati, Ohio and community work with CHWs in low-income South African
communities to confirm that the hearing aids deliver hearing test precision to the highest standard. This
audiometry will be part of a more comprehensive diagnostic package involving novel physical (smartphone
video otoscopy) and behavioral (speech-in-noise) data. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the performance of the
hearing aids to gold-standard and conventional clinical fitting standards. In a community setting, we will also
determine usability by including CHWs and users. Training and supporting CHWs is critical for our approach
and in Aim 3 we will work with our colleagues in the hearX Foundation to develop new training modules.
Multiple techniques will be used to engage CHWs in each stage of the process, for example, adjusting existing
modules found to be useful in previous hearing screening outreach. Freshly hired CHWs will test-drive and
evaluate the training. Another part of this aim is to begin developing the mHealth user support system (apps) to
be used in the clinical trial phase (Aims 4 and 5). Infographics and voice bytes will be translated to the local
language (e.g. Xhosa) in an approach, using WhatsApp, we have shown to improve knowledge about hearing
loss of preschool teachers. In the R33 phase of funding, the focus narrows to two clinical trials. In the first (Aim
4), we ask whether the smartphone-based, CHW-facilitated hearing aids successfully deliver benefit for their
users. In the second trial (Aim 5) we ask whether an mHealth user support system, developed in Aim 3, is
effective in delivering benefit. Both studies are randomized control trials, the highest level of clinical scrutiny. In
Aim 6, we will model data from Aims 1-5 using AI towards a holistic hearing assessment. Positive, self-report
outcomes and modeling should pave the way for an expansion to the next level, regional and national trials
that, if successful, will be of huge personal importance for millions of individuals in LMICs. They will also open
the gate to international adoption of this innovative, mHealth driven, community-based model of hearing care."
11080137,"ABSTRACT: The elucidation of potentially modifiable molecular pathways involved in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)/Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementia (ADRD) is of great scientific
interest and offers hope for improved public health. Mounting evidence points to the role of
calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in ADRD. Indeed, cPLA2 expression is
increased around amyloid plaques in patients with AD and is associated with a brain
inflammatory response. Reducing cPLA2 gene expression improves learning and memory in AD
mouse models. Further, APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, has been
shown to promote and accelerate brain inflammation, while the underlying mechanisms are not
well understood. This project aims to test the hypothesis that cPLA2 activation is associated
with faster cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers by accelerating known pathology (AD and
vascular) and brain inflammation. Leveraging brain biospecimens and detailed clinical and
neuropathological data from the Religious Order Study cohort, we propose the following three
Aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the patterns of cPLA2 activation and signaling pathways in
older subjects with and without dementia (clinical AD), stratified by APOE4 using frozen human
brain samples and single brain cell types isolated from a subset of samples. In Aim 2, we will
use ex vivo stimulation to study cPLA2 activation and signaling mechanisms in neurons and glia
of post-mortem brain tissues, stratified by APOE4 and dementia. In Aim 3, we will investigate
whether the association between the decline in global cognitive and APOE genotype is
mediated by cPLA2 activation. In addition, we will explore if AD neuropathological markers (Aβ,
pTau, or both) and other vascular pathological markers mediate this association. This project
will elucidate a novel mechanism for APOE4 induced brain inflammation in AD/ADRD. The
study of available brain tissues from well-characterized autopsied persons with a range of
clinical and pathologic phenotypes will provide deep insights into cell-specific cPLA2 activation
profiles in relation to APOE4 and markers of inflammation. Identifying a role for cPLA2 activation
in AD inflammation is a significant step toward the development of cPLA2 inhibitors, and
ultimately improved treatments for AD/ADRD. The focus of this supplement plan will be to
expand on cPLA2 research by studying it in the context of cellular senescence with two
particular aims: AIM 1: Identify whether cPLA2 is required for lipid-induced senescence in iPSC-
derived astrocytes. And, AIM 2: Assess senescence phenotypes in a patient-derived-iPSC
population."

This project aims to advance transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technologies for psychiatric disorders.
TMS outcomes vary among participants, likely due to a lack of adaptation to individual brain states. We thus
propose a closed-loop approach where real-time electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain
oscillations can inform the timing of TMS at the prefrontal cortex. However, closed-loop TMS applications are
currently not implemented in clinical practice due to a lack of validated methods for targeting prefrontal brain
oscillations and identifying markers of TMS target engagement. Invasive electrophysiological recordings in
nonhuman primates (NHPs) offer a high signal-to-noise ratio and improved localization of brain responses.
Simultaneous scalp EEG recordings will inform translational efforts in humans. We aim to identify markers of
TMS engagement in the prefrontal cortex from invasive electrophysiological recordings in NHPs and
differentiate direct neural responses from indirect stimulation effects. We will further characterize the effects of
closed-loop TMS on invasive electrophysiological responses and determine optimal stimulation parameters. By
delivering TMS at different phases and power states, we will measure TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) to
identify the most effective stimulation parameters for prefrontal closed-loop TMS. Finally, we will evaluate the
effects of closed-loop theta burst stimulation (TBS) on neural plasticity. By tracking prefrontal theta rhythms in
real-time, we will deliver TMS pulse bursts at specific phases to enhance the effectiveness of TBS protocols.
We will assess induced neural plasticity through the measurement of TEPs and local functional connectivity.
Successful completion of this research could lead to the development of improved closed-loop TMS protocols
for the prefrontal cortex, with direct implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in humans."
11049675,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Childhood neglect accounts for 60% of all early life adversities and is associated with profound cortical
thinning, hyperactivity, and cognitive deficits that include impaired hippocampal dependent memory. The
molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for these neurodevelopmental changes are difficult to study in
humans and no animal models have yet replicated key structural and behavioral features of early
deprivation/neglect. Here we show that mice pups raised under impoverished conditions of limited bedding and
no nesting material (LB) show behavioral and structural changes that resemble those seen in children exposed
to early neglect and that enrichment during the 2nd-3rd week of life corrects the hippocampal-dependent deficits
seen in LB mice. In this proposal we hypothesize that LB inhibits the expression of the TREM2 receptor on
microglia during peak synaptic pruning in the hippocampus. Abnormal synaptic pruning during the 2nd-3rd
weeks of life leads to the retention of immature/non-functional spines resulting in immature and inefficient
hippocampal circuitry characterized by low synaptic maturity index, reduced local functional connectivity in
resting state fMRI, lower density of glutamatergic synapses, and impaired hippocampal function. Work in aim 1
will test whether overexpression of TREM2 is sufficient to correct the synaptic and cognitive abnormalities seen
in adolescent LB mice. Chemogenetic activation of microglia and exposure to enrichment both increase levels
of TREM2 and normalize microglial phagocytic activity. Studies proposed in aim 2 will test whether localized
chemogenetic activation of microglia in the dorsal hippocampus from P13-17 can reverse the synaptic and
cognitive deficits seen in LB adolescent mice. In aim 3 we will use Trem2 knockout mice to test whether the
improved hippocampal function seen with enrichment, requires Trem2. Successful completion of this proposal
will be the first to demonstrate that early neglect impairs synaptic pruning by reducing the expression of Trem2
and that these developmental abnormalities can be reversed with enrichment. These findings will provide a
conceptually novel model to explain how deprivation and enrichment impact cognitive development and will
hopefully inspire future collaborations to examine the effects of early neglect/enrichment on rsfMRI local
functional connectivity in children."

There is a need in the market for a true platform technology that automates the tissue
processing experience. Syntr Health Technologies has dedicated the last six years developing
the technology that can streamline tissue processing. Our FDA-cleared SyntrFuge System and
SyntrFPU360, is a platform technology that can process a variety of different tissue types such
as cancer tumors of kidney, liver, brain, and breast tissue by dissociating them into single cells
to better understand tumor tissue heterogeneity, of which the single cell analysis market is
valued at $3.3 Billion and expected to grow to $6.3 Billion by 2026. As well, our platform can be
used to microsize autologous adipose tissue to be used for reinjection back into the patient to
treat medical conditions of the aging population such as diabetic foot ulcers and knee
osteoarthritis. Syntr has successfully completed an SBIR Phase I grant where we utilized
micronized adipose tissue to heal diabetic ulcers in an animal model. This study had an
important role in developing a treatment modality that translated successfully into humans.
Preliminary human clinical data is showing significant diabetic foot ulcer wound closure within 3-
5 weeks using autologous adipose tissue processed in our platform. The diabetic foot ulcer
market is currently valued at $1.98 Billion with a CAGR of 8.2%. This high growth potential is
attributed to the increase of the diabetic population. Additionally, the use of microsized adipose
tissue is showing great promise in intra-articular injections to knee joints for the treatment of
osteoarthritis (OA). The knee OA market in North America is currently valued at $5.9 Billion and
growing at t CAGR of 8.8%. Over 88% of individuals with OA are 45 or older. The high growth
potential of this market is largely attributed to the increase of the aging population along with the
increase in obesity rates. Our platform technology for the rapid processing and/or microsizing of
tissues can disrupt these markets in a major way. The automation of this technology in this
Phase I SBIR is paramount to increase favorability in the adoption of this much needed
technology in various medical fields.."
11054086,"Project Summary/Abstract
Distal radius fractures (DRF) are the most common upper extremity fracture. They disproportionately affect
older women, and the overall incidence is increasing worldwide. Deciding on appropriate DRF treatment
remains a challenge, with multiple high-quality studies reporting conflicting results due in part to inadequate
patient-specific granularity in treatment decision-making. A better understanding of the recovery process,
especially early in treatment, is needed. Although several outcome measures are available to evaluate early
recovery following DRF open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), including strength/range of motion testing,
patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and motor testing, they all fall short in accurately describing functional
use of the upper extremity (UE). Standard accelerometry tracking is also inadequate since it cannot reliably
differentiate between functional and nonfunctional UE use. The objective of our proposed study is to evaluate
the application of refined machine learning (ML) algorithms to parse out the accelerometer data and gain unique
insights as to how the arm is being used as an indication of functional recovery after DRF ORIF.
We will train these algorithms on patients’ data from controlled environments and then test on accelerometry
data from at-home use. This training is based on videos of patients performing tasks in our lab with
accelerometers on their wrists. The data obtained from the accelerometers will be analyzed through a series of
ML algorithms designed to categorize functional versus non-functional UE movement, then compared to
determinations of UE use from video review. Once the analysis algorithms are refined and reliably indicate
functional versus non-functional use from accelerometry, we will use them to analyze accelerometry data
obtained at home during tasks that will also be video recorded, scored, and compared to accelerometry results.
This will show how accurately we can use accelerometer data to track UE functional use in a natural setting.
Throughout these phases we will obtain PRO data and compare these data to video results. With this we aim
to understand the value of PROs in describing UE function, as well as use the ML algorithm analyses of early
accelerometry data to predict long-term recovery and outcomes.
The shortcomings of available instruments for evaluating early functional recovery following DRF ORIF
remain. Additionally, full-time patient observation is impractical and tedious, while accelerometry data alone are
inaccurate in differentiating functional versus nonfunctional UE use. Our approach is based on prior successful
work but is novel and innovative for the evaluation and management of surgically-treated DRF. By
accomplishing these aims, we will introduce and operationalize a suite of ML algorithms that can be
readily applied to accelerometry data and accurately capture functional UE use to help optimize patient-
centered DRF post-operative recovery with patient-specific granularity."

 Our overarching goal is to sustain, enrich and diversify resource infrastructure for the Rhode Island
Children’s Health Study (RICHS; Marsit, Stroud MPI: R24ES028507) by facilitating future longitudinal follow-
up, accelerating data management and sharing, and diversifying the scientific workforce. RICHS was
developed to characterize the impact of the environment on newborn and early childhood health outcomes
with a novel and unique focus on the mechanistic role of placenta molecular function in mediating the
impact of the chemical, physical, social, and behavioral environment on infant/child health and disease. The
cohort is comprised of 840 mother-infant pairs from the Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts
region enrolled using a population-based recruitment strategy. RICHS offspring at the start of this project
range in age from 8.8-13.8 years—a critical period for environmental influences on development. Data and
results from the cohort have made seminal contributions to elucidating (a) the fundamental molecular biology
of the placenta, (b) the impact of environmental exposures on placental epigenetic and genomic regulation,
(c) links between placental molecular variation and newborn growth and neurobehavioral outcomes, as well
as (d) novel methods development. Resources/investigators from the RICHS cohort contributed to 75
publications (42 during the R24 period), 10 NIH grants including fellowship and career development awards
for early career scientists, and >20 post/doctoral projects. The proposed U24 infrastructure support will
facilitate prospective, longitudinal assessments of novel child health and disease outcomes, postnatal
environmental exposures, structural and social determinants of health, as well as continued collection of
biospecimens into the RICHS biorepository. The U24 will also support enrichment of data management and
broad sharing of cohort resources, with all activities aimed at providing opportunities for a diverse cadre of
scientists across career stages to access to data and biospecimens to develop novel research questions.
Specifically, the goals of this R24 infrastructure support project are to (1) support the infrastructure of diverse
workforce of the cohort, (2) continue to obtain longitudinal data on mother-child pairs, (3) broaden the
diversity of RICHS by facilitating enrollment of new participants from complementary Rhode Island cohorts,
(4) refine and expand systems for broad sharing of cohort data and resources, (5) increase opportunities for
scholars from historically under-represented groups to engage with the RICHS cohort, and (6) work with the
consortium in developing integrated measures and common strategies for data sharing and collaboration.
Ultimately, U24 infrastructure support will maximize NIEHS investment by increasing diversity of
participants, workforce, and measures in this highly unique and productive cohort, accelerating
discovery and catalyzing future transformative contributions to children’s environmental health."
11064238,"The United States is still struggling with an opioid epidemic and high rates of opioid use disorder (OUD).
Medically supervised withdrawal is an important tool in management of OUD, where opioid discontinuation
occurs either directly from nonmedical opioid use or following agonist treatment. Abrupt discontinuation of
chronic opioid use results in a severe, multidimensional withdrawal syndrome that includes symptoms such as
aches/pain, tremors, restlessness, as well as increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia), and negative emotional
symptoms such as anxiety and irritability. There is compelling preclinical evidence that delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) agonists can reduce opioid withdrawal
symptoms. However, direct CB1R agonist-based medications can produce adverse side effects and have
demonstrated abuse liability. New research suggests that indirect agonism of CB1R through increasing
circulating endocannabinoids (eCBs) is a promising strategy as it confers similar benefits with fewer undesirable
cannabimimetic effects. Recently, we determined sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) acts as a binding and transport
protein for eCBs and we have synthesized an SCP-2 inhibitor (SCPI-1) to block eCB transport and thereby
increase eCB tone. This R21 Exploratory/Developmental application will evaluate the effects of SCPI-1, a
novel endocannabinoid transport inhibitor using a multidimensional model of opioid withdrawal
symptoms in rats. Our Primary Aim is to evaluate whether SCPI-1 attenuates symptoms of spontaneous
morphine withdrawal in male and female rats and determine whether effects of SCPI-1 are via CB1R-dependent
mechanisms. Opioid physical dependence will be induced using a morphine dose escalation and maintenance
procedure (opioid dependent group). Following abrupt discontinuation of morphine dosing, we will inject SCPI-1
or vehicle under blinded conditions and then assess opioid withdrawal symptoms that include: 1) somatic signs
(e.g., ptosis, wet-dog shakes, grooms, hypophagia and weight loss) and food intake and body weights; 2)
negative emotional symptoms of anxiety- and irritability- like behavior in the open field, elevated plus maze, and
bottle brush test; and 3) hyperalgesia using the von Frey test of mechanical pain sensitivity. In addition, we will
evaluate if effects of SCPI-1 on withdrawal-related behaviors are CB1R-dependent through pretreatment with
the CB1R antagonist rimonabant or its vehicle under blinded conditions. Overall, this research will evaluate
efficacy of SCPI-1 for treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms and advance medications development of SCP-
2 inhibitors as a novel target for OUD.
This supplement is proposed to provide additional funding support for the PI given they experienced a critical life
event during Year 2 of the parent grant. The PI had a child in July of 2023 and was on maternity leave through
October, pausing data collection and delaying the completion of project aims. The supplement will be used to
increase research technician support to compensate for the delay in data collection."
11064239,"Directed evolution mimics and accelerates natural evolution in the laboratory in order to create useful
new biomolecules and to study evolutionary processes. Although methodologies for directed evolution are well-
established in test tubes and in simple organisms like E. coli and yeast, there is still a major challenge. Specifi-
cally, novel biomolecules derived from directed evolution campaigns in these platforms often fail to function
when transferred to more complex cellular environments, such as that of human cells. To address this critical
issue, our laboratory recently pioneered a directed evolution platform that can be used to repeatedly generate
massive libraries of mutant biomolecules while continuously selecting and enriching the most functional vari-
ants directly in the human cell environment. From a chemical biology perspective, we are also deeply engaged
in studying functions of the proteostasis network – a vital and unique aspect of the human cellular environment
that ensures proteins are correctly folded, processed and trafficked. We have developed an array of chemical
genetic tools to modulate proteostasis, and we are now primed to integrate these tools with our directed evolu-
tion platform to both evolve previously inaccessible biomolecule functions and gain a deeper understanding of
how cells solve protein folding problems.
 Altogether, this NIGMS MIRA application seeks to combine two of my laboratory's primary interests: (1)
Developing and applying next-generation, human cell-based directed evolution platforms to generate biomole-
cules optimized for function in complex cells and (2) Integrating evolution with chemical modulation of proteo-
stasis to gain new insights into fundamental principles of proteostasis network function. Here, we propose to
integrate these research areas to deliver an array of biomolecules that reliably and robustly perform valuable
new functions in the complex human cellular milieu. Examples include G-protein coupled receptors controlled
by synthetic regulators for neuroscience applications, systems for incorporation of unnatural amino acids in
proteins, and inhibitors of important signaling pathways related to disease. All of these targets have proven ex-
ceedingly difficult to reliably evolve in lower organisms or test tubes. Beyond these practical advances, we will
also integrate human cell-based directed evolution with proteostasis modulation to gain insights into how the
network solves protein folding problems. For example, we will use our capacity to modulate proteostasis to test
the hypothesis that chaperones can be used to “turbo-charge” directed evolution campaigns by providing ac-
cess to otherwise biophysically unacceptable regions of the mutational landscape. Further, we will pursue an
understanding of the roles of chaperones in human protein evolution, a process that is particularly important in
the setting of tumorigenesis and in the development of drug resistance in oncogenes. Altogether, our contribu-
tions will impact fields ranging from biotechnology and drug development to protein folding biophysics, evolu-
tionary biology, and cancer research."
11064240,"Summa - Moffitt CSBC Pro osal Overview
The Moffitt CSBC proposal is focused on the essential and highly dynamical interplay between cancer cell
evolution and the constantly changing ecology of the lung microenvironment. Tumors are not simply collections
of mutated cells that grow in isolation. Rather, they respond to and modify both the physical microenvironment
and a variety of host cells, and these changes in ecology (""Δ-Ecology"") are key to understanding tumor
progression and the response to therapy - particularly the development of resistance. Central to this proposal
is quantifying, understanding, and actioning the change that occurs during treatment to both the tumor and
non-tumor ecology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common and among the most
lethal of human cancers. We will define the ecological and evolutionary dynamics that govern NSCLC
progression and treatment success or failure through 2 projects and 2 shared resource cores. Each project will
focus on different ti.-Ecology dynamics in the presence of different driver mutations (RAS, EGFR, ALK) for
which targeted therapy is available. Each project demonstrates our unifying theme of tight
empirical/mathematical integration through the sequence of develop, predict, calibrate, test, optimize, and
validate. Thus, each project begins with available clinical data followed by in si/ico (predict and optimize), in
vitro (calibrate and test) and in vivo (validate) model systems leading to readily translatable treatment options.
The mathematical and ecological Cores incorporate the mathematical and computational methods needed for
bridging the projects. The Math Core will serve as the mechanistic model engine of the center, facilitating both
spatial and non-spatial models of eco-evolutionary processes to generate and test hypotheses regarding Δ-Ecology.
The Ecology Core serves as data repository and ecological analysis engine working in lockstep with
the three Projects focused on different aspects of NSCLC Δ-Ecology (Immune and Stromal) to develop and
apply spatial ecological models. These cores will serve our two projects:
Project 1: Delta immune Ecology of NSCLC 1.1 Quantify the Δ-Ecology of patient samples pre- and on-treatment
to predict outcomes; 1.2 Impact of KRAS inhibitor therapy with immunotherapy on lung tumor

Acute leukemia is a leading cause of death in the young. The goal of my research program is to identify the
genomic drivers of leukemogenesis and treatment failure, and through experimental modeling gain mechanistic
insight to enable the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, and ultimately improve cure
rates for this disease. In the last project period, I identified multiple subtypes of leukemia that led to a revision of
the molecular taxonomy of acute lymphoblastic and lineage ambiguous leukemia; I defined the relationship of
genomic variegation and clonal evolution in leukemia; I demonstrated the role of liquid-liquid phase separation
in leukemogenesis; and I developed new therapeutic approaches using targeted protein degradation directed at
intractable drivers of high-risk leukemia. In this proposal, the original overarching goal remains unchanged, but
my research program will address several conceptually new areas of research that have been stimulated by my
prior discoveries. These include (1) defining the mechanism by which enhancer deregulation drives
leukemogenesis in T-lineage ALL; (2) investigating how concomitant LMO2-activating and STAG2-inactivating
alterations perturb chromatin state to drive leukemogenesis, and how this may be exploited for therapeutic
benefit; (3) elucidating how BCL11B deregulation primes primitive hematopoietic cells for lineage ambiguous
leukemia; (4) determining how fusion oncoprotein-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) drives chromatin
and transcriptional deregulation in leukemogenesis, and how this may be targeted for therapeutic benefit; and
(5) developing molecular glue-based targeted protein degradation strategies to improve cure rates for childhood
leukemia. These research areas explore central questions in childhood and adult leukemia, including the
mechanisms by which enhancer hijacking/deregulation events drive leukemogenesis, the basis of cell lineage
ambiguity in lineage ambiguous leukemia, the mechanistic role of LLPS in leukemogenesis, and the efficacy of
innovative therapeutic approaches to degrade intractable drivers of acute leukemia. To achieve these goals I will
use innovative experimental approaches including novel engineered mouse models, single cell barcoding and
lineage tracing, multiomic gene expression-chromatin profiling, LLPS-condensate profiling, and exploitation of a
unique small molecule library of molecular glues. This research program will be facilitated by collaborations with
colleagues with expertise in these approaches. Collectively, these approaches will yield fundamental mechanistic
insight and therapeutic advances that will improve cures for currently intractable high risk leukemias."

 Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal with major public health concern around the world. Increasing studies
suggest that Cd is a neurotoxicant, and the Cd exposure is associated with learning and memory deficits, and
various neurodegenerative diseases in humans. My previous study has found that environmental relevant Cd
exposure can impair learning and memory in animals. However, the current knowledge about the mechanisms
of Cd neurotoxicity is still very limited. There is an increasing recognition that the gut-brain axis, a communication
pathway between the central nervous system and the gut microbiome, is important for regulating neurological
functions. Since the gut microbiome is a target of Cd toxicity, I hypothesized that the gut-brain axis
mechanistically contributes to Cd neurotoxicity. This project aims to determine if the gut microbiome contributes
to Cd neurotoxicity on learning and memory and identify specific microbiomes and microbial metabolites that
mechanistically contribute to Cd neurotoxicity. The K99 mentored phase proposes to (1) examine the changes
of the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites according to the onset of Cd-induced learning and memory
deficits, and further (2) determine if the gut microbiome is both necessary and sufficient for Cd neurotoxicity by
using antibiotics-treated mice to determine how depletion of the gut microbiome modulates the Cd-induced
learning and memory deficits in mice, and conducting fecal microbiota transplant in antibiotics-treated mice
inoculated with intestinal content collected from Cd-treated mice with impaired memory to determine how a
“diseased microbiome” itself contributes to cognitive deficits. During this time, the candidate will complete
mentored training and courses in the microbiome, bioinformatics, second-generation sequencing, and other
professional development training in preparation for the independent R00 phase. In the independent phase, with
the findings from the K99 phase, this project will further identify specific microbiomes and microbial neuroactive
metabolites that contribute to Cd toxicity in learning and memory. Regarding the expected outcomes, this project
will determine for the first time the importance of the gut-brain axis in Cd-induced neurotoxicity, enhance the
understanding of the mechanisms concerning the neurotoxicity of Cd and other environmental neurotoxicants,
and provide translational insights for the design of prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate Cd
neurotoxicity by reprogramming the gut microbiome."

Community colleges (CCs) are primary engines for economic advancement for persons from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds, but the promise of higher education is often thwarted by untreated mental health
problems, especially among racial/ethnic minority students. Alarmingly high rates of depression and anxiety on
community college campuses collide with daunting life challenges (such as early adversity, housing, and food
insecurity) and inadequate mental health resources. Untreated depression and anxiety can have dire
consequences, extending from poor academic performance to suicide. To address the enormous mental health
gap in a low income, highly diverse sample of CC students at East Los Angeles College (ELAC), we propose to
evaluate a scalable, efficient, and evidence-based system of care called STAND for screening, tracking, and
treating anxiety and depression. STAND uses a stratified stepped care model, ranging from self-guided online
cognitive behavioral prevention, to online cognitive behavioral therapy with coaching, to clinician-delivered care.
Continuous tracking enables treatment adaptation as needs evolve plus rapid detection and management of
suicidality. The STAND system was implemented on the UCLA campus from late 2017- early 2020. Since Fall
2019, we have been collaborating with ELAC administrators and students to adapt STAND for their needs and
have an ongoing pilot project funded through the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health (2020-2022).
This pilot lays the groundwork for ALACRITY in which we will optimize STAND at ELAC (n=1000) with continuing
support from DMH and we will explore sustainability and spread to other CCs. The ALACRITY center focuses
upon (1) optimizing effectiveness through multivariate predictive models, including social determinants of mental
health, for improving stepped care triaging, adaptation, and risk detection, which will simultaneously advance the
science of personalized mental health, (2) optimizing implementation through exploratory projects, pilot trials and
Methods Scientific Area hubs that primarily target uptake and engagement as well as integration and cultural
competency to meet the needs of this underserved, diverse student population, and (3) exploring sustainability
via centralized state-wide data-streams, cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment projections for STAND
implementation, investigation of generalizability, and exploration of barriers and facilitators of implementation
across geographically diverse CCCs, that inform discussions with policy makers and stakeholders. The overall
approach is guided by the Accelerated Creation to Sustainment implementation framework which allows for
continuous evaluation and redesign over each annual cohort. The Administrative Core will oversee operations
of the Center, pilot study program, training of junior investigators, and sustainability planning. The Methods Core
will support research projects, implementation efforts, and innovative and synergistic collaborations that focus
on increasing engagement of stakeholders. Our long-term goal is to optimize STAND through personalization
tools and facilitate expansion of STAND’s reach across CCs statewide and ultimately nationwide."
11050439,"Project Summary. The brain systems that control our motivation, emotions, and decisions rely at their most
fundamental level on predicting the future: learning what outcomes to expect, when they will arrive, and how
valuable they will be. It is only natural that we are strongly motivated to seek information that will reduce our
uncertainty. But despite its importance in everyday decision making and clinical settings, little is known about
how information seeking behavior is controlled – how the brain anticipates information, endows it with value,
and sends it to motivational circuits to drive behavior.
We identified set of anatomically connected areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex and subregions of the
basal ganglia, that encode the quantitative level of reward uncertainty to control information seeking to resolve
that uncertainty. We also showed that the value of information is computed through a conserved algorithm in
the brains of macaques and humans, and that this algorithm governs value-based decisions through the lateral
habenula (LHb). Leveraging this insight, the Aims will answer several key questions. We will study a crucial but
understudied pathway in primates: concentrating on whether and how the thalamus causally mediates
prefrontal cortical computations that regulate information seeking. And we will assess how the anatomically
defined cortical-basal ganglia-thalamus loop performs the computational steps of estimating and representing
reward probability distributions, computing their uncertainties, and how it causally uses these representations
to set the value of information and regulate information seeking decisions.
Our key overarching hypothesis is that the thalamus transmits information about uncertainty to the cortex and
causally regulates cortical uncertainty processing to control information seeking. Aim 1 will uncover whether
and how the primate thalamus regulates the motivation to seek information to reduce uncertainty through
online modulation of the neocortex. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that anterior medial thalamus is
a key source of uncertainty signals, and that it causally regulates cortical computation to guide information
seeking. Aim 2 will assess whether and how different subregions within the cortical basal ganglia thalamic loop
represent probability distributions and their uncertainties and use them to motivate information seeking
decisions. Our hypothesis is that the decision variables in the cortex are computed from distributional
representations of value and uncertainty to guide deliberative information seeking decisions through LHb and
moment-to-moment information seeking behavior through the basal ganglia, and that these processes are
dependent on thalamic inputs. The Aims offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of
information seeking, and to study clinically relevant primate brain areas that have remained understudied. In
the long term, research on information seeking will provide crucial insight about neural circuit function in health
and disease in an age in which information seeking has become a critical component of adaptive behavior."

 Approximately 1 in 3 reproductive aged women and girls suffer from migraine, the most disabling disease of
this demographic worldwide. Affective disorders are 2-3 times more common among migraineurs, and
migraineurs with psychiatric comorbidity report more functional impairment and worse quality of life than
migraineurs without psychiatric conditions. Despite the high prevalence of this comorbidity and evidence of
shared pathophysiology, the association between migraine and affective disorders remains largely unexplored.
Fluctuations in female sex hormone levels play a significant role in migraine and affective disorder
presentations and are particularly volatile across the menstrual cycle and during reproductive life transitions
(puberty, postpartum, menopause); however, the longitudinal relationship between migraines and affective
disorders across the life course has not been studied. Up to two-thirds of female migraineurs experience
menstrual migraine and half of women with affective disorders report premenstrual exacerbation of anxiety and
depression. However, migraine has not been studied as a risk factor for premenstrual syndrome/premenstrual
dysphoric disorder or as a marker of increased hormonal sensitivity among women with anxiety or depression.
 The objective of this research is to collect and analyze detailed longitudinal data on migraine and mental
health symptoms to establish migraineurs as a unique phenotype of individuals with affective disorders due to
their vulnerability to hormonal fluctuations. In Aim 1, Dr. Crowe will determine the longitudinal association
between migraine and affective disorders across the lifespan with an emphasis on hormonal transitions using
data from the Nurses’ Health Study cohorts. In Aims 2 and 3, she will focus her work on hormonal fluctuations
across the menstrual cycle. She will design and implement a sub-study in the Nurses’ Health Study 3 and
Growing Up Today Study cohorts using smartphone data and ecological momentary analysis to estimate the
relationship between migraine (menstrual and overall) and premenstrual syndrome/premenstrual dysphoric
disorders (Aim 2). Dr. Crowe will also collect data on affective disorder symptom variability across the
menstrual cycle among migraineurs, compared to non-migraineurs (Aim 3). To carry out this research, Dr.
Crowe will receive training and mentorship from a team with expertise in epidemiological measurement of
affective disorders, smartphone digital phenotyping, and modeling of high-dimensional longitudinal data. She
will also draw on the myriad professional resources available at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard
Medical School, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Altogether, the proposed research and
training will improve affective disorder risk assessment and screening, inform treatment for those with
comorbid affective disorders and migraine and prepare Dr. Crowe with the skills and preliminary data to
become an independent researcher at the intersection of mental health and reproductive epidemiology."
11055915,"PROJECT SUMMARY
According to the Centers for Disease Control, hearing loss is the third most common chronic physical condition
in the US, surpassing diabetes, and cancer in prevalence. Most cases of hearing loss occur due to damage to
the cochlear amplifier. The term ""cochlear amplifier"" refers to the chain of processes that amplify low-level vibra-
tions within the cochlea, thereby enhancing the sensitivity and dynamic range of hearing. While many details of
the amplifier's mechanisms remain unclear, it is well-established that electromotility, the voltage-activated length
changes of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), plays a crucial role. The OHC-driven amplification is vulnerable to
common factors such as excessive noise, ototoxic drugs, aging, and congenital defects. Various insults can
affect distinct stages of the amplification process, inhibiting electromotility or reducing OHC stimulation, leading
to sensory hearing loss. However, current diagnostic tests, such as recordings of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs),
have limited ability to provide precise information on the site of damage within the cochlea and its functional
consequences. My research aims to address this gap by developing a diagnostic test of cochlear amplification.
We propose that recordings of cochlear microphonics (CM), which represent the summed electrical fields of
stimulated OHCs, can assess the functional state of local cochlear amplification and identify the site of damage
within the amplifier. The proposed test combines the place-specific properties of cochlear two-tone suppression
with recent findings on intracochlear motions that reveal broad regions of excitation and suppression in OHC
vibrations. We hypothesize that the suppression of CM responses is controlled by local gain changes in cochlear
motions; hence, we named it gain-sensitive CM (gCM). Thus, the gCM test should be capable of detecting coch-
lear regions with dysfunctional OHCs and evaluating the dynamic range of the amplifier at a specific cochlear
location. Furthermore, we predict that gCM, when measured in low- vs. high-intensity regimes, will exhibit differ-
ential sensitivity to cochlear amplification loss caused solely by dysfunctional electromotility vs. by disruptions in
the processes driving it. Currently, no other hearing test can achieve this level of diagnostic precision, which is
essential for developing and testing individualized treatment options. In the short term, we aim to validate the
gCM in mice by comparing it to direct, albeit invasive, measures of cochlear gain in the organ of Corti vibrations
as well as to more established OAE tests. To evaluate the hypothesized site- and place-specificity of gCM, we
will use both healthy and hearing-impaired mice where damage is either limited to a specific stage of the ampli-
fication process or to a specific cochlear region. The results of this study have the potential to revolutionize the
treatment of sensory hearing loss by providing an objective and noninvasive test to identify the nature and loca-
tion of cellular damage responsible for amplification loss that outperforms OAE tests. Consequently, this project
could enhance the precision of diagnosing sensory hearing loss in humans and facilitate the development and
implementation of targeted intervention strategies in both research and clinical settings."

There is a crucial need for scalable, accessible mental health treatments that are delivered outside of clinics
and can be integrated into daily life. Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) delivered via smart-
phones and wearables represent a promising method to increase access to cost-effective and acceptable
mental health care, and tailor in-the-moment interventions to best match the speciﬁc context of the individ-
ual and their personal stressors, and determine when the individual is most likely to beneﬁt from the inter-
vention. However, these more scalable, personalized, context-sensitive interventions raise ethical questions
tied to patient consent and acceptability, intrusiveness of monitoring, privacy and data security tied to both
the collection of sensitive data and the associated computational methods applied. The main objective of
this supplement is to answer these crucial ethical questions related to leveraging mobile sensing, wear-
ables, and computational methods for socially anxious individuals in the context of digital mental health
interventions. To our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst to tackle the speciﬁc ethical concerns for conducting
research with mobile sensing devices with individuals high in social anxiety, which is especially important
given this population has strong fears of evaluation and self-consciousness. To address this need, in Study
1, N=20 individuals high in trait social anxiety will be invited to engage in 1-hour, one-on-one, in-person
interviews. We will follow a semi-structured interview guide to enquire about views toward wearable sen-
sors (particularly watches) and passive monitoring on mobile phones. In Study 2, we will do a secondary
data analysis, leveraging data collected from a group of socially anxious (N=46) participants as part of
our R01 parent grant. Speciﬁcally, we will use existing data to empirically investigate the risk of person
re-identiﬁcation (i.e., predicting a participant's identity using features extracted from sensed data streams).
More broadly, we will identify the key factors (e.g., individual, modalities/sensors, and contextual differ-
ences) that contribute to privacy risks in biobehavioral data. After identifying the key factors contributing
to privacy risks, we will develop and test privacy-preserving techniques that are tailored to those factors,
to minimize the privacy risks while still obtaining valuable insights from the data. For JITAI's to meet their
promise, we need to understand socially anxious individuals' preferences about different types of mobile
sensing, various combinations of data streams, risks of sharing the resulting data with different people, and
trade-offs between privacy on the one hand and knowledge production and clinical efﬁcacy on the other
hand. Together, this work will inform guidelines for researchers and practitioners so they can beneﬁt from
mobile sensing and JITAIs in a way that is ethical and patient-centered, while not compromising model
performance."
11063576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metastasis to distant organs is the major cause of breast cancer-related death. Bone is the most frequent
destination of metastasis. Over 45% first-site metastases occur to bone, as compared to 19% to lung, 5% to liver
and 2% to brain. Patients with skeleton as the first site of metastasis usually have better prognosis than those
with visceral organs as first site. However, in more than two third of cases, bone metastases will not be confined
to the skeleton, but rather subsequently occur to other organs and eventually kill patients. This raises the
possibility of secondary metastatic dissemination from the initial bone lesions to other sites. In fact, some
metastases first found in non-bone organs may be seeded from subclinical bone micrometastases as well, as
suggested by the finding that cancer cells arrived in the bone can acquire more aggressive phenotypes even
before establishing overt metastases. Recent genomic analyses indeed concluded that the majority of
metastases result from seeding from other metastases, rather than primary tumors. Thus, it is of imperative
importance to investigate further metastatic seeding from bone lesions, as it might lead to prevention of the
terminal stage, multi-organ metastases that ultimately cause the vast majority of deaths. Despite the potential
relevance, we know very little about metastasis-to-metastasis seeding. Current pre-clinical models focus on
seeding from primary tumors, but cannot distinguish further dissemination. Taking advantage of a recently
developed approach that selectively deliver cancer cells to hind limb bones, we have uncovered frequent
metastatic seeding from established bone lesions to multiple other organs. This seeding is hypothetically enabled
by the bone microenvironment-induced effects that confer more stem-like properties through a combination of
clonal selection and epigenomic adaptation. In this application, we will elucidate the underlying mechanisms and
temporal course of this process in order to provide the first ever insights into time window and strategies of
potential therapeutic interventions. We hypothesize that clonal selection and epigenetic adaptation driven by the
bone microenvironment engender the ability of disseminated breast cancer cells to further metastasize and
blockade of the microenvironment-induced alterations may confine bone metastases and prevent further
dissemination to other fetal organs. Our specific aims are 1) to characterize the kinetics of metastatic seeding
from bone lesions and determine potential therapeutic windows accordingly, and 2) to identify key druggable
targets and design therapeutic strategies against secondary metastatic seeding from bone lesions. This project
is innovative and impactful because it is the first in the field that focuses on secondary metastasis and the
profound reprogramming effects of bone microenvironment on metastatic seeding. The outcome will likely
generate significant impact on our understanding of metastatic evolution and provide insights into novel therapies
confining metastases for ultimate cure."
11064755,"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord damage in older adults. It is
characterized by physical compression of the spinal cord and often progresses gradually over months to years,
manifesting as weakness, numbness, and pain. Because it is a disease that disproportionately affects an aging
population and leads to decreased quality of life, it has a high relevance to Veterans. Many patients with CSM
have favorable outcomes after surgical intervention, but opportunities to improve outcomes through mechanistic
understanding of the disease process and improved diagnostic markers would be beneficial to improve diagnosis
and patient management, potentially leading to improvements in therapies. This project aims to examine the role
of spreading depolarization and perfusion deficits in the context of CSM in preclinical animal models. Spreading
depolarization (SD) is an abnormal wave of ionic and electrical that propagates through central nervous system
tissues after an insult. While SDs have been well-established and characterized after acute physical trauma,
they have not been investigated with persistent or repetitive physical compression of the spinal cord that is the
hallmark of CSM. Further, SDs and underlying perfusion deficits are tightly coupled. Neurons with sufficient
oxygen and glucose can recover from SDs, but neurons that are lack sufficient metabolic substrates have a high
likelihood of being irreparably damaged by SDs. This project will use an animal model and electrophysiological
recordings to characterize SD events in the spinal cord in the context of continuous or dynamic physical
compression (Aim 1). In parallel, it will examine the perfusion deficits in the spinal cord using MRI or intraspinal
pressure sensors in the context of a clinically relevant animal model of CSM with progressive spinal cord
compression (Aim 2). Collectively, these studies will elucidate the mechanisms of spinal cord damage in CSM
and may provide new avenues for diagnostic markers. Detecting abnormal perfusion noninvasively with MRI has
a clear translational path for subsequent clinical studies of CSM patients. The team of investigators on this project
have individual expertise in all of the different subject areas, and their combined multi-disciplinary approach to
these studies will collectively examine a new research area with potential high clinical relevance and translational
opportunities."
11064756,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the US. It is difficult to cure CRC
because majority of the existing therapies fail to significantly obliterate seeds of cancer called `cancer stem
cells (CRCSCs). Cellular cholesterol metabolism is a single most important target for CRCSCs. However,
existing therapies that target this pathway, e.g. statins fail to significantly inhibit cholesterol levels in the cells
due to redundant mechanisms that govern cholesterol levels in cancer cells. However, cholesterol utilization is
regulated by select group of specific cholesterol transport proteins, which if targeted, can have critical effect on
plasma membrane (PM) biophysical properties of CRC cells. We have identified a cholesterol transport protein
called StarD5, which is the only known mammalian protein that regulates cholesterol transport to cell
membrane. StarD5 is significantly overexpressed in human colon cancer tissues and particularly in colon
CRCSCs. Inhibition of StarD5 resulted in significant inhibition of colon CSCs in vitro and in vivo, as well as
cholesterol contents in PM resulting in increased PM fluidity and robust inhibition of Insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor (IGF1R) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. We propose to examine, in detail,
the significance of StarD5 overexpression on colon cancer initiation, progression, and patient outcomes
as well as impact of StarD5 modulation on CRCSC phenotype in human CRCSCs (Aim 1). We would
also like to understand mechanisms of how StarD5 inhibition regulates CSCs. To that end, we propose to
determine the effect of StarD5 inhibition on PM fluidity, influx of platinum agents, and growth factor signaling
initiated in PM (Aim 2). Moreover, we plan to examine the efficacy of small molecular inhibitors of StarD5
(SD5i) on CRCSC phenotype using primary human colon spheroids as well as determine their efficacy of in
combination with FDA-approved chemotherapy and targeted therapy (panitumumab) against advanced
animal models of CSCs (Aim 3). The studies will provide novel insight into how alternation in
membrane cholesterol regulates cancer growth, and provide a novel class of target for cancer therapies
that may lead to long-term remission and/or cure by targeting therapy resistant CRCSCs."
11064757,"The proposed research will develop a novel system for optogenetic vagus nerve stimulation and investigate the
impact of vagal stimulation in a rodent model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Therapeutic interventions using peripheral nerves of the autonomic nervous system are increasingly being
considered and applied to modulate organ function for disease treatments. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has
been clinically approved for over two decades for its treatment of epileptic seizures and depression. It has also
demonstrated positive clinical outcomes in the treatment of inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis
and Crohn’s disease, while clinical and pre-clinical data suggest therapeutic benefit in heart disease and
diabetes. Cholinergic (parasympathetic) pathways of the vagus nerve are an important factor in the
therapeutic effects that are observed. The ‘cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway’ is an established signaling
mechanism by which the expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines are reduced in the spleen and
in other visceral tissues. Because inflammation is a driver of numerous diseases, the ability to regulate
inflammatory mediators is of major interest. In state-of-the-art electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS),
however, current is applied broadly to the nerve and the non-specific nature of this stimulation activates off-
target pathways causing adverse effects to the patient, and furthermore, does not provide adequate precision
to study and understand therapeutically relevant nerve pathways. The proposed research will develop and
apply an optogenetic system for vagus nerve stimulation that can eliminate these off-target complications.
With optogenetic tools, light-sensitive actuators can be targeted to cell-types of interest via genetic targeting
and tissue-specific viral delivery, thus enabling highly specific activation and investigation of neural circuits.
This neuromodulation methodology will be applied to PTSD, a highly prevalent burden among the U.S. Veteran
population. PTSD is highly correlated with elevated inflammation and often co-morbid with many of the
diseases mentioned above. In addition to the anti-inflammatory pathways of the vagus nerve, beneficial
impacts observed in psychiatric and inflammatory disorders suggest that vagal stimulation may be effective in
treating PTSD, and indeed, VNS in rodent models enhances fear extinction and reduces anxiety. The current
study will develop a 3D-printed vagus nerve cuff system for optogenetic studies (Aim 1). This biocompatible,
single-component, optical stimulation nerve implant will enable an easy-to-fabricate and easy-to-implant device
for chronic stimulation. The effectiveness and longevity of the system will be validated by assessing cardiac
responsivity longitudinally in surgically implanted mice (Aim 2), before testing the system in a PTSD mouse
model (Aim 3). A previously described single electric footshock protocol will be used to condition associative
fear to a conditioned stimulus – the shock chamber. Vagal stimulation of optogenetically targeted efferent
(cholinergic) and/or afferent (glutamatergic) fiber subtypes will be applied concurrently with exposure to the
conditioned stimulus over a period of 5 days. Extinction of fear, and anxiety level measured with the ‘elevated
plus maze’ test will be assessed in stimulated and non-stimulated control animals."
11064758,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that develops when the immune system loses tolerance for
myelin in the sheath wrapping axons of the central nervous system (CNS). Damage to the myelin sheath can
result in paralysis, vision impairment, and other neurological complications that significantly diminishes MS
patient quality of life. There is no cure and many MS therapies also eliminate beneficial immunity. One
experimental strategy to specifically counter autoimmunity is the generation of regulatory cell types, such as
regulatory T cells (TREGS). The goal of such approaches is to selectively suppress the inflammatory T and B cells
that are overactive and target myelin through cytotoxic pathways or antibody generation, respectively.
Generation of antigen-specific TREGS and tolerance that counter autoimmunity could provide long-lasting
treatments, while preserving protective immunity. A new idea to promote TREGS is suppression of toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling. TLRs regulate a power set of pathways that regulate immunity and evolved to detect the
pathogens associated molecular patterns to initiate inflammation and eliminate dangerous pathogens. While
TLRs are well known for their role in pathogen detection, surprising new studies show TLRs are also over-active
during autoimmunity. To harness TLR signaling, the Jewell lab developed a nanotechnology platform where a
regulatory TLR ligand (GpG) is synthesized with myelin self-antigen (MOG) to ensure immune cells receive both
the signals to promote myelin-specific TREGS. Since these nanomaterials – termed immune polyelectrolyte
multilayers (iPEMs) – are built entirely from the immune signals, they display the cues at a high density to potently
modulate immune function. Administration of the iPEMs containing GpG and MOG prevents disease-associated
paralysis in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS.
While promising, these effects were transient, and required multiple, high doses of iPEM injections. To overcome
these challenges, I will develop microneedle arrays (MNAs) to deliver iPEMs built from myelin self- antigen and
regulatory TLR ligands directly to the skin. MNAs are small patches (~1 cm dia.) with polymer needles several
hundred microns in length, designed to target the immune-rich layers in skin. Skin is our largest immunological
organ and contains a high density of immune cells, with specialized phenotypes that are constantly surveying
the skin for foreign pathogens. Recent evidence indicates that some of these immune cells have a unique ability
to promote TREGS in vivo, which were then able to suppress symptoms of paralysis in a common mouse model
of MS. These exciting and recent results suggest that if the tolerance biased immune cells in skin could be
harnessed through their TLR signaling pathways, they may be directed towards a tolerogenic phenotype.
The central hypothesis of this VA CDA-2 proposal is that tolerogenic iPEMs delivered through MNAs will drive
tolerogenic phenotypes in skin-resident antigen-presenting cells that will migrate to draining lymph nodes (LNs)
and instruct T cells toward a TREG phenotype that restrains autoimmunity in a mouse model of MS. To test this
hypothesis, I have designed three specific aims to: 1) assemble iPEM coatings on MNAs and predict their efficacy
in vitro, 2) deliver iPEMs to skin using MNAs to test efficacy and specificity in mouse models of MS, and 3) test
the role of TREGS in promoting efficacy of iPEM coated MNAs and investigate tolerance biomarkers in skin-
draining LNs. This approach will provide two unique opportunities to address both disease and quality of life
issues facing Veterans and their families. First, leveraging the unique immune environment in skin to achieve
antigen-specific tolerance for MS could improve therapeutic efficacy and specificity. Second, MNAs can be
applied independently by MS patients with motor deficits, which would improve independence and compliance.
Collectively, achieving these goals would elevate Veteran MS patient quality of life."
11064759,"The lack of understanding of the fundamental neurobiology that underlies the development and persistence
of post-traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced acute and chronic pain is currently unknown, further limiting our ability
to develop appropriate treatments. Electro-acupuncture (EA) is a healing modality that has been in use for years.
It's modes of action, however, are largely unknown, although there is increasing evidence that brain and spinal
cord are primarily involved in the processing of acupuncture stimuli. The analgesic effects of acupuncture are
well documented. In addition, acupuncture's powerful ability to modulate systemic inflammation during acute and
chronic events has recently been documented in multiple disease conditions. However, there is not enough
preclinical data using the procedure to initiate a clinical trial for TBI. The main objective of this proposal is to test
the dose-dependent effectiveness and mechanism of action of EA treatment to alleviate pain/headache-like
behavior in a clinically relevant rodent model of closed head traumatic brain injury (CH-TBI). This model closely
resembles blunt trauma head injury seen in human injury situations involving head impact from automobile
crashes, sports, and from blast injury received in battlefield situations. This CH-TBI rodent model exhibited
comprehensive evidence of progressive and enduring orofacial and somatic pain/headache-like symptoms
induced by non-painful stimulation. These pain/headache-like symptoms correlated with changes in several
known pain signaling receptors and molecules along the trigeminal and spinothalamic neuronal pain pathways.
Since post-TBI induced chronic pain and headache are major health issue in both military and civilian personnel,
preclinical research aiming at the exploration of underlying neurobiology, and targeted therapy is vital. Therefore,
the objective of two mechanism driven Specific Aims in this proposal is to enhance our understanding of the
neurobiology of EA therapy-influenced changes in TBI-induced pain/headache-like behaviors tested as facial
and somatic hyperalgesia/allodynia. Our recent studies using a mild CH impact acceleration TBI model in adult
Sprague Dawley rats revealed significant and enduring trigeminal and plantar hyperalgesia using a state of the
art operant orofacial and paw pain reward/conflict testing paradigm. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the therapeutic
potential of EA therapy on the progression of TBI-induced orofacial and paw allodynia/hyperalgesias at acute
(immediate after TBI) and chronic (2 months) time points after TBI using 2 different durations (2-week vs. 4-
week) of EA therapy. Specific Aim 2 will address TBI and therapy-induced changes in mechanisms of pain
signaling in trigeminal and somatic pain pathways; these studies will quantitate of changes in a comprehensive
array of MRI-based biomarkers, molecules, and receptors related to pain signaling and inflammation in the
trigeminal and somatic pain pathways using quantitative MRI, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) based
techniques. The investigators propose that EA treatment will produce a safe, significant reduction of orofacial
and somatic allodynia/hypersensitivities; accordingly, this therapy has the potential for rapid clinical translation
as significant drug free therapy to treat TBI-induced pain and headache. Investigators further propose that the
EA treatment-induced significant reduction in orofacial and somatic pain sensitivity will be accompanied by
significant reduction of inflammatory biomarkers, and pain signaling molecules/receptors in the facial and
somatic pain pathways. MRI and IHC data will further identify details of the mechanisms of action. These studies
have the potential to increase our understanding of the neurobiology of TBI-induced pain/headache and the
mechanisms of benefits from EA, appropriate time of treatment initiation, duration of treatment, and further
provide a platform for the development of TBI-induced pain/headache treatment in both genders. We do
hypothesize that the effectiveness of EA will be maximal if it is administered acutely after injury before significant
maladaptive plasticity in pain pathways happen. Moreover, 4 weeks treatment will produce significantly better
outcomes compared to 2-week treatment due to stimuli-based enduring guided plasticity in the pain pathways."

Lipases are a key regulator of metabolic equilibrium in the human body. Examples of conditions in which lipases
are dysregulated include pancreatitis, metabolic syndrome, and lipid storages diseases. One of the hallmarks of
pancreatitis is the secretion of digestive enzymes, such as pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PTL), into the
capillaries, rather than the digestive tract, which damages pancreatic cells. Thus, there is a clear need for precise
spatiotemporal regulation of lipase activity in the body. In recent work, we found that lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
adopts an inactive helical oligomer for storage in adipocyte vesicles prior to secretion. Lipases, like LPL, have a
special need for mechanisms of self-regulation, as many possess phospholipase activity, making it difficult to
store them in phospholipid-based vesicles. It is likely that other lipases beyond LPL self-regulate by quaternary
structure formation to protect the delicate balance of metabolism in the body.
In Aim 1, I will elucidate the in situ structure of inactive oligomers of LPL. I will train to use cryo-electron
tomography (cryoET) to study LPL structure inside of vesicles. I will also develop a conformation-specific
nanobody to discriminate between helical LPL and monomer LPL for use with immunofluorescence microscopy.
I will launch my independent R00 research phase by investigating PTL in Aim 2. Preliminary data suggests that
PTL forms filaments inside of vesicles and I will screen PTL in vitro for the ability to form inactive self-regulated
oligomers and solve their structure using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). I will then apply the pipeline of
cryoET and nanobodies developed for studying LPL in vivo, to look at PTL. Finally in Aim 3, I will use pancreatic
acinar cells to examine the secretome of the pancreas with and without an acute pancreatitis phenotype. I will
look specifically for enzymes stored in inactive quaternary structures and characterize the role played by
heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in secretion. HSPGs have been shown to stabilize LPL filaments and
are top candidates for targeting self-regulated filaments into secretory granules. This research will provide crucial
information about the structure of lipases in vesicles during cellular trafficking and identify innovative ways to
address dysregulation of enzyme secretion associated with pancreatitis.
The skills I acquire using cryoET, developing nanobodies, performing immunofluorescence microscopy, and
learning about the pancreas will be essential for setting up my success as an independent researcher. They will
allow me to pursue pioneering studies of in situ lipase quaternary structure and uncover mechanisms to prevent
dysregulation of enzyme secretion during pancreatitis."

The overall objective of this proposal, “Multimodal Artificial Intelligence to Predict Glaucomatous
Progression and Surgical Intervention”, is to use multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and deep
learning strategies to predict which glaucoma patients will need glaucoma surgery and which
are likely to have progressive visual field loss in the future. This study is designed to leverage
longstanding well characterized clinical and research cohorts of glaucoma patients and its
validated decision support AI infrastructure to predict which glaucoma patients will progress and
which will need surgery. The proposal includes the following two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will use
baseline electronic health records (EHR), optic nerve head (ONH) optical coherence
tomography (OCT) imaging, visual field (VF) data, intraocular pressure (IOP) and central
corneal thickness (CCT) in a multimodal DL model to predict the likelihood of surgical
intervention for glaucoma. Aim 2 will use baseline EHR, ONH OCT imaging, VF data, IOP and
CCT in a multimodal DL model to predict the likelihood of fast glaucomatous visual field
progression. To address these aims, existing data from glaucoma patients 1) enrolled in the
National Eye Institute funded Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS 1995-present)
and African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study (ADAGES 2009-2021), and 2) managed
at the UCSD Viterbi Family Department of Ophthalmology will be used in the AI model
development and testing. We will also leverage UCSD’s existing cloud-based AI pipeline to
build a glaucoma-specific platform to train, test and in the future, update the deep learning
models developed. In the future, this infrastructure can be used to support randomized clinical
trial testing of AI guided glaucoma management and enable real-time decision support for
clinicians."

The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) is a cell cycle control that ensures accurate
chromosome segregation during cell division. It is activated by unattached kinetochores, which
recruit many different signaling proteins to produce an inhibitory signal that delays anaphase
onset and averts chromosome missegregation. Aberrant SAC signaling has long been suspected
to promote genome instability in cancerous cells, but the nature of the aberrations and their
consequences remain unclear. We propose that the perturbation of SAC signaling dynamics can
elevate chromosome missegregation. However, the SAC has been mainly studied under quasi
stead-state conditions despite being a dynamical process. Therefore, we will tackle questions
central to SAC signaling dynamics using a systems biological approach that integrates
quantitative data and mathematical modeling. Our goal is to answer the following fundamental
questions using a combination of experiments and theoretical modeling: What is the rate at which
a single unattached kinetochore generates the ‘wait-anaphase’ signal? Does it change over the
course of cell division? Is it sufficiently high to delay anaphase onset indefinitely? What are the
main determinants of this rate? Answers to these questions will reveal a dynamical picture of SAC
signaling and allow us to define the causes and consequences of aberrant SAC signaling in
cancer cells."

The United States (U.S.) Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan’s primary goal is to reduce the number of new
HIV infections by 90% by 2030, but this will not happen unless we develop ways to BRING the evidenced-
based services to persons who use drugs (PWUD). Overdose deaths are dramatically increasing in the US,
and fentanyl and stimulants are fueling new HIV epidemics. My career and my passion revolve around
integration of treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorders with HIV treatment
and prevention. Through over 20 years of direct clinical care as an infectious disease and addiction medicine
physician combined with substantial clinical research expertise involving PWUD living with and at risk of HIV, I
know the blind spots in the EHE plan and I can fill them in with this pioneer award. My pioneering award
vision is to: 1) train persons who live in the communities affected by high levels of overdose to be community
health workers (CHWs) to provide the HIV testing and rapid diagnosis of OUD; 2) create mobile hubs that are
pharmacies and clinics on wheels that can be deployed to immediately dispense pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP), antiretroviral therapy (ART), and medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) anywhere; 3) develop rapidly
deployable mobile rapid response teams (the mobile spokes) comprised of the CHWs and pharmacists with 24
hour access to online clinicians that deploy out from the mobile hubs to where the CHWs identify to bring the
medications (PrEP/ART based on the rapid HIV testing results, and MOUD to people who have a diagnosis of
OUD) to where people ‘live’; and 4) collaborate with researchers, including modelers, to prioritize where
outbreaks of HIV are most likely to occur and provide a collaboration hub for others working in the fields of HIV
and substance use disorders to help inform this proposed care model. Through this award, I will also ensure
that the mobile rapid response teams continue to follow people and help them retain on the medications and
address competing needs to eliminate barriers to accessing services. Thus, the overall idea in this pioneer
award is providing low barrier services at multiple access points in line with the EHE plans where we would be
BRINGING the testing and treatment plans (MOUD, PrEP/ART) to PWUD and RETAINING them via non-
traditional methods where THEY LIVE. Through using trained persons who LIVE in the communities (CHWs)
with shared living experiences of their community members who use drugs and are at risk or living with HIV,
we can provide the testing and diagnosis services combined with pharmacists to dispense the medications in
real-time to people who typically do not have access to our normal clinical or research venues including
women, justice-involved persons, immigrants, the uninsured, and underrepresented minorities. I have the
experience, the passion, the work ethic and the collaborative team to help end HIV in PWUD through this
pioneer award."

We propose to create the Center for Innovative NeuroTech Advancement (CINTA), a new
center for rapid transformation of emerging technologies into commercially viable,
clinically focused solutions for disorders of the nervous system. The PD/PIs, Drs. Steven
Schachter and Paolo Bonato, together have many decades of experience creating and
managing complex multi-institutions, multi-disciplinary, national translational research
organizations, and expertise in neurotechnology-related research, and will leverage their
experience to further innovate, adapt, and deploy the well-developed, proven approach to
needs-driven healthcare technology innovation pioneered, developed, and validated for 23
years by the Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation & Technology (CIMIT). Led for
the past 23 years by Dr. Schachter and colleagues, CIMIT has a proven track record of success
as a national center for healthcare innovation and a unique model to identify unmet medical
needs; find, fund, and facilitate technology-based projects to solve those needs; and rapidly
move these innovations from concept to manufacturing to commercialization to the end-user.
Combining their decades-long expertise and interest in neurological disorders and rehabilitation,
the PD/PIs will oversee the advancement of projects under CINTA’s five cores: Administrative
Core, Outreach Core, Evaluation Core, Innovator Subprojects Core, and Resource Subawards
Core. Paul Tessier, Program Director for the Administrative Core, will have overall responsibility
for integrating the activities of the different cores to accomplish the overall goals of the proposed
Center under the guidance of the Center PD/PIs. The Administrative Core will ensure ongoing
input from NIH program directors and science officers, as well as input from the Steering
Committee members who are integral in providing guidance to the program to help diversify the
types of projects as well as increase representation of proposers of varying backgrounds. Key
center activities to accomplish the overall goals include established needs assessment and
project solicitation processes, and CIMIT’s virtual collaboration platform, CoLab, to help CINTA
investigators and facilitators track important deliverables in four areas critical to commercial
success. CoLab will also be used as a platform for shared CINTA resources, such as a CINTA

the well-established national and international collaboration networks of CIMIT and Spaulding to
achieve CINTA’s goals and enhance externally funded collaborations."
11056980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human gammaherpesviruses (γHVs) Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus are
DNA tumor viruses that establish a lifelong infection. These viruses are strongly associated with pathogenic
outcomes in immune suppression, including the AIDS defining malignancies Kaposi's sarcoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. A major challenge of the γHVs is that these viruses present a lifelong risk for viral re-
emergence and pathogenesis, especially in the context of acquired or medically-induced immunosuppression.
Lifelong infection is further confounded by the limited therapeutic interventions against γHV diseases. To date,
the best defense against γHV-induced disease is an intact immune system. Despite this correlation, there
remain major knowledge gaps in our understanding of: 1) protective aspects of successful vaccination to γHV
infection, and 2) consequence of vaccination on the composition and frequency of infected cells, either before
or after established infection. In this R01 application, we seek to investigate how vaccination alters γHV
infection, using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a mouse model of γHV infection, that facilitates study of
infection and associated responses from primary infection through lifelong latency and re-emergence of lytic
infection. We recently undertook studies to characterize how latency is regulated by viral and host factors at
the single-cell level, identifying that the latent pool is heterogeneous based on expression of the latency-
associated nuclear antigen (LANA), and that the proportion of LANA+ latently-infected cells is subject to
regulation. These studies further identified that CD8 T cells, and the cytokine interferon-gamma, limit LANA+
latently-infected B cells, and that vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine is capable of profoundly restricting
LANA+ latent B cell infection in an interferon-gamma-independent manner. We now seek to investigate the
role of myeloid cells in infection and vaccination on γHV infection both in vitro and in vivo. We will make use of
vaccination protocols with defined differences in efficacy to identify the critical features using single cell
analysis and high dimensional methods to distinguish the features of vaccine efficacy. We hypothesize that
vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine induces: 1) local and systemic myeloid reprogramming,
which 2) redirects γHV myeloid infection into an immune-susceptible myeloid target. We will test this in
three aims. First, we will analyze the impact of vaccination on local and systemic myeloid cells. Second, define
how vaccination affects primary γHV infection of myeloid cells. Third, dissect how viral tropism is influenced by
vaccine-induced effector mechanisms. By analyzing specific viral and host processes in the context of
vaccines with varying efficacy, this proposal seeks to investigate myeloid reprogramming as a necessary, and
therapeutically viable, target for vaccination against γHV latency."

People living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer because of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). With longer life
expectancy, PLWH are experiencing an increased incidence in non-AIDS defining malignancies.1 Lung cancer
is the most common cause of cancer mortality and is one of the most commonly occurring cancers in this
population. Lung cancer incidence is nearly three times higher in adults with HIV as compared to those without
HIV.2 Screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT (LDCT) reduces mortality by at least 20%.3-6 The reduction in
mortality may be even greater in PLWH, as they have been shown to have shortened survival following lung
cancer diagnosis largely due to late-stage presentation.7 Currently PLWH are subject to the same screening
eligibility criteria as those without HIV, based only on age and smoking history.8 While the prevalence of smoking
is higher among PLWH, studies that have controlled for tobacco use still showed a significant increased risk for
lung cancer among PLWH compared to adults without HIV.1 This could indicate that HIV modifies the risk for
lung cancer independent of smoking intensity and duration. PLWH who are adherent to ART and continue to
smoke are significantly more likely to die from lung cancer than from AIDS-related causes.9
The rapid advancements in machine learning with LDCT have significantly enhanced the accuracy of predicting
lung cancer incidence and mortality using medical imaging. Our latest deep learning model has achieved AUC
> 0.91 when evaluating overall cancer risk in nodules identified during screening. This assessment was
conducted using thousands of LDCT scans from both in-house sources and the National Lung Screening Trial
(NLST), encompassing data from over 20,000 patients. 10-12 Additionally, we have recently introduced fully
automated body composition analysis into lung cancer risk prediction models, which has added value for patients
as it can predict outcomes, specifically all-cause mortality.13 However, applying these models to PLWH may
not yield the same level of accuracy due to the models being trained primarily on the general population.
This discrepancy highlights the well-known issue of domain adaptation, where a model developed for one
specific population might not perform as well when applied to a different group. In response to this challenge,
our current study aims to assess the effectiveness of our previously validated AI models using real-world data
from PLWH.
Lung screening may be improved by incorporating blood-based biomarkers with imaging. There is a need for
better and more accessible biomarkers to improve lung cancer detection. Biomarkers with multi-protein panels
(MPPs) are emerging, but it is unknown if these will improve early detection or improve care. Before MPPs can
be used at scale, we need to understand the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers, especially in patients
who are at increased risk, for example, those living with HIV."

The long-term goal of this research is to improve the management of cervical cancer across the lifespan for
women living with HIV (WLH). The purpose of this proposal is to determine how cervical cancer treatment
planning techniques can be adapted and automated for WLH to include bone marrow sparing and treatment of
pelvic nodes—both which are valuable considerations for clinics with limited resources where the incidence of
cervical cancer and HIV are high. The hypothesis is that at least 90% automated treatment plans created for
WLH that include nodal boosting and bone marrow sparring are clinically acceptable. The first specific aim will
be a retrospective planning study where automated methods for bone marrow sparing are validated on an
existing biocohort dataset from Zambia. Ionizing radiation dose to marrow containing structures and adjacent
organs will be studied and associated with number and location of enlarged nodes that are boosted to a high
radiation dose using the adapted technique. The second specific aim will develop and validate deep learning
models to autocontour enlarged nodes (from HIV-reactive adenopathy and malignancy). Differences in the
sensitivity and accuracy of autocontouring between cohorts of WLH and women without HIV will be reported.
The outcomes from this research will be a comprehensive understanding of how treatment planning techniques
can be adapted for WLH that receive cervical radiotherapy. In addition, a suite of tools specifically designed for
these scenarios described above will be integrated into a deployable FDA approved platform to increase
access to this treatment adaptation for WLH and allow for future clinical studies of hematological toxicity and
outcome for WLH."

Approximately 4 million amputees globally, a number estimated to grow 200,000 annually. Upper limb
amputees traditionally use passive, body powered, or electrically powered prostheses that use surface
Electromyographic (EMG) signals from intact muscles in the residual limb for movement, despite the
motion artifacts, variability and need of visual and/or surrogate sensory control by the user. Advanced
peripheral nervous system (PNS) interfaces have been proposed as a viable mechanism to improve the
control by amputees, by reading naturalistic sensory feedback from the robotic prosthetics. Unfortunately,
current neural interfaces suffer from common challenges, and electrode failure, signal deterioration over
time, EMG contamination and electrical and unstable sensory percepts, including “stings or tingles” remain
a challenge. This study is uses two novel strategies designed to increase the selectivity of
recording/stimulation at the PNS interface: 1) The use of an innovative regenerative multi-electrode
interface with ultra-small recording sites using our recently developed ultra-thin multielectrode array , and
2) incorporation of molecular guidance cues to influence the type of sensory neurons at the neural
interface. This selectivity Regenerative Ultramicro Multielectrode Array (RUMEA) is designed to
discriminate between motor and cutaneous neural interfacing by combining it with molecular guidance to
biologically engineer the content of sensory-motor axons at the electrode interface. Three specific aims
are included: In SA1 36-electrode RUMAs, straight and Y-shape devices, will be fabricated and
electrochemical and mechanical tested. In SA2 we seek to demonstrate selective recording from motor
axons and evoke touch percepts using the RUMA. In SA3, we will demonstrate selective interfacing of
motor and tactile axons in an upper limb amputee rat model of bidirectional Nerve Machine Interface using
molecularly guided RUMAs. If successful, this strategy will demonstrate the benefit for using RUMA for
selective recording from motor axons, and stimulation of sensory modality axons that evoke naturalistic
sensory percepts. This advancement in peripheral neural interfaces for amputees, will reduce the cognitive
burden for users of robotic prosthetics, and decrease the abnormal sensations associated with electrical
stimulation in the PNS."

With the alarming increase in the incidence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistance bacteria, there is an
urgent need to identify new strategies to combat this emerging threat. The development, growth, and survival
of all living organisms rely on coordinated gene expression. Central to gene expression is RNA polymerase
(RNAP), a multi-subunit protein that transcribes genetic information from DNA to RNA in the complex and
highly regulated process of transcription. Transcription has three major stages for creating a nascent RNA:
initiation, elongation, and termination, each of which is controlled by protein transcription factors. RNAP is a
proven drug target, but RNAP’s mechanistic features and how it is regulated by transcription factors remain
poorly understood in pathogenic bacteria. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of action of
RNAP and key transcription factors involved in regulating RNAP initiation (CarD), elongation (NusG and NusA)
and termination (Rho) in order to improve future antimicrobial development. In this proposed research, I will
investigate the biochemical, structural, and genetic basis of the transcriptional machinery of Clostridioides
difficile (C. diff.), a life-threatening gut pathogen that is resistant to multiple antibiotics. In Aim 1(K99 phase), I
will investigate the functional relationship between two paralogs of the transcription regulator CarD and RNAP
through in vitro and in vivo studies to test the hypothesis that the two CarD paralogs compete to bind and
regulate RNAP, and the interplay of these factors is critical for coordinated control of transcription initiation in
C. diff. In Aim 2 (K99/R00 phase), I will use genomic-scale mapping techniques and genetic assays to
interrogate how Rho rewires gene expression by terminating transcription by RNAP. I will also design
biochemistry assays to elucidate the mechanisms by which NusA and NusG, two universal elongation factors,
modulate Rho-RNAP behavior. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will build an in vitro platform using the Broccoli
fluorescent RNA aptamer to enable high-throughput screening of inhibitors of C. diff. RNAP. Virtual screening
will be conducted to identify novel inhibitors based on our newly obtained cryo-EM structure. The proposed
research in the K99 phase will mainly be conducted in the lab of Prof. Robert Landick at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. The key area that I will acquire additional research training is genome-scale mapping
techniques and corresponding bioinformatics skills to analyze high-throughput datasets. I will also be guided by
an advisory committee including collaborators Prof. Federico Rey (UW-Madison, an expert in microbiome-host
interactions) and Prof. Elizabeth Campbell (The Rockefeller Univ., an expert in cryo-EM of RNAP and
associated proteins), and consultant Prof. Joseph Sorg (Texas A&M Univ., an expert in C. diff genetics and
physiology). I will also benefit from the facilities and abundant resources at UW-Madison. During the mentored
phase of this award, I also plan to hone my skills in teaching, leadership and scientific communication, which
will facilitate my transition to an independent research career."

 CRISPR-based technologies have transformed science by enabling targeted DNA modification. DNA
editing technologies have enriched our mechanistic understanding of DNA repair, and new insights in repair
are frequently used to improve methods for gene editing. However, despite the remarkable achievements in
targeted DNA modifications, RNA repair is understudied, and RNA editing tools are limited. The long-term goal
of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern RNA repair and to develop disruptive
new RNA editing tools for applications in science and medicine. The research proposed here integrates
synergistic efforts to develop CRISPR-based tools for dissecting viral mechanisms of host cell take over and
identify viral RNA repair mechanisms that support acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
replication. In Aim 1, I will repurpose RNA-targeting CRISPR systems for deleting, inserting, and substituting
sequences in viral RNAs. I have designed CRISPR-Cas systems to delete regions of ORF7a in the SARS-
CoV-2 genome and recreate naturally occurring mutations. Based on my previous work, I anticipate that
targeted deletions in ORF7a limit viral suppression of the host interferon response and lead to a replication
defect. Further, tools developed in this application will be used to test emerging viral variants for new
phenotypes. Aim 2 investigates the antagonistic activities of host antiviral nucleases and host RNA ligases in
the replication and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Aim 3 develops a CRISPR-based RNA capture system to enrich
sequence-specific RNAs from a complex mixture. I will use CRISPR-based enrichment to map RNA
modifications in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs and identify molecular signatures associated with interspecies
transitions. Successful completion of the K99 phase of this application will require training in the Biosafety
Level 3 facility, bioinformatics training to identify and annotate CRISPR systems, as well as new competencies
in RNA biochemistry. Collectively, the research and training objectives outlined here establish a solid scientific
foundation that will facilitate my transition to independence."
11080141,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV remains one of the world’s most devastating diseases, with more than 38 million people living with HIV
(PLWH) and an additional 1.7 million new infections per year. Moreover, in 2019, infection with malaria was
reported to have reached 229 million cases worldwide and caused over 409,000 deaths. Although advances
have been made in reducing the incidence of both HIV and malaria, the risk of infection with either disease is
still great, especially in resource-limited countries. Importantly, the geographical overlap in endemic HIV and
malaria constitutes a high risk for co-infection, fueling transmission and pathogenesis of both diseases. The
burdens of HIV and malaria are particularly elevated in pregnant women, leading to increased risk of poor birth
outcomes and maternal and infant mortality. Notably, malaria in pregnancy (MIP) in women living with HIV (WLH)
results in even greater risk of adverse outcomes and the treatments currently available for MIP have only shown
limited success in WLH. Therefore, our long-term goal is to identify key factors in MIP immunopathogenesis to
aid in development of new therapeutics that can safely and effectively reduce maternal and fetal morbidity and
mortality in WLH. The overall objectives for this application are to (1) dissect the pathogenic outcomes of P.
fragile infection in SIV+ pregnant rhesus macaques (RMs) and (2) mechanistically elucidate the role of
neutrophils and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in decidual inflammation during SIV/P. fragile co-infection. Our
central hypothesis is that P. fragile and SIV co-infection of pregnant RMs will result in greater placental
parasitemia and dysfunction that associates with higher levels of decidual neutrophil accumulation and ILC
activation, as compared to mono-infected or healthy RMs. The rationale for the proposed research is that a better
understanding of the complex interplay of neutrophils and ILCs in placental dysfunction will promote subsequent,
targeted studies to leverage our findings to develop novel interventions to treat MIP in WLH. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To identify key pathogenic consequences of P.
fragile infection and the impact of SIV co-infection during pregnancy; 2) To define the role of neutrophils in
peripheral and decidual inflammation during co-infection of pregnant RMs; and 3) To determine the role of ILCs
in regulating peripheral and decidual inflammation in co-infected pregnant RMs. The proposed research is
innovative because it focuses on using a highly translational animal model to open new scientific horizons on
key alterations in innate immune function that drive poor maternal and fetal outcomes in SIV and P. fragile co-
infection, which closely parallels the dynamics of HIV and P. falciparum infection. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide a strong, evidence-based foundation for future pre-clinical studies
of the biological mechanisms of MIP in WLH. Ultimately, these studies will provide new opportunities to develop
therapies and prevention strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria in highly vulnerable WLH."

 This supplement application addresses the need to better prepare researchers in Guam and
Micronesia, particularly in data science, so they can pursue careers in cancer health disparities and other
biomedical fields. Pacific Islanders are extremely underrepresented in the nation’s biomedical workforce, both
on the faculty of universities and research institutions as well as in hospitals and public health departments.
The limited number of Pacific Islanders with graduate degrees continues to impede progress in research and
prevention of cancer health disparities. The Pacific Island Partnership for Cancer Health Equity (PIPCHE) is
the National Cancer Institute’s only U54 partnership that advances cancer health equity in Pacific Islands
Populations (PIP). PIPCHE’s overarching goal is to promote cancer health equity and mitigate the impact of
cancer on PIP through increasing cancer research leadership and capacity in Hawai‘i, Guam and the USAPI.
The University of Guam (UOG) is the minority-serving institution (MSI) within PIPCHE and is a USDA land-
grant institution whose student population is 90% Asian Pacific Islander, of whom 51% are native Pacific
Islanders. UOG is uniquely situated to recruit and inspire future professionals from these Pacific Islander
groups as well as conduct research with the diverse communities living in Guam and other Micronesian
islands.
 The current goal of PIPCHE’s Research Education Core (REC) is to train graduate students committed
to addressing health disparities in Pacific indigenous populations. Despite the success of the PIPCHE-REC in
training PIP students to pursue and complete graduate degrees, there remains a dearth of researchers
competent in data science in Guam. Additionally, UOG has limited faculty with expertise in math, statistics, and
data science, all burdened with full teaching schedules. Furthermore, UOG graduate students funded by
PIPCHE-REC extensively utilized PIPCHE's Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSR) for thesis project data
analysis due to their limited experience in statistics and data science. A new graduate program in Data
Science has been developed at UOG, which would equip students with the technical skills to collect, manage,
analyze, and interpret data, and will also be proficient in programming languages such as R and Python, and
statistical analysis tools such as SAS and SPSS. The anticipated start of the program is Fall 2024.
 The proposed supplement seeks to support the establishment of a Data Science Center at the UOG,
designed to complement the MS in Data Science program and bolster the region's data science capabilities.
Integral to this program is the mandatory capstone course entitled ""Statistical Research and Consulting.""
Within this course, students will undertake internships at the Data Science Center, engaging in collaborative
projects with UOG researchers or partnering with government agencies. The Center will serve as a hub for
additional support, offering students enhanced opportunities to gain valuable research skills and practical
experience.
 As part of this initiative, we aim to enhance UOG's data science capabilities by upgrading our
infrastructure with high-performance workstations and developing a comprehensive cancer database. We
intend to investigate the feasibility of linking the Guam Cancer Registry (GCR) with data from Guam's
Medicare, Medicaid, and Medically Indigent Program (MIP) recipients. This integrated dataset is expected to
be a valuable resource for researchers. Furthermore, we plan to forge partnerships with regional community
colleges to offer summer data science workshops.
Aim 1: Establish the first regional Data Science Center in synergy with the MS in Data Science at UOG.
The center will provide research support and advance education in data science in Guam and Micronesia.
Aim 2: Establish infrastructure, security protocols and agreements necessary for the data linkage
between Guam Cancer Registry and Medicare, Medicaid and MPI. The linkage would improve the
completeness of GCR treatment data and will be the source for future studies, for example adherence to
treatment and its impact on survival.
Aim 3: Build data science education and training partnerships with the Northern Marianas College
(NMC) and Palau Community College (PCC). These partnerships will enhance data science knowledge and
skills of the researchers and students in NMC and PCC and create the pipeline for the data science path at
UOG.
We hypothesize that the establishment of the Data Science Center will significantly increase the number of
underrepresented students, particularly Pacific Islanders, trained in statistics and data science.
Impact: This supplement will greatly enhance the research and data science capacity of UOG, Guam and the
greater Micronesian region. Students trained in the proposed program would be equipped with the necessary
skills to work as data analysts in both academic, healthcare, and industry settings."
11064107,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Immunotherapy has become an emerging standard-of-care (SOC) for many different cancer types. However,
only 15-20% of patients receive durable benefit. Other limitations include the toxicity of systemically-delivered
immunomodulators which may require frequent, high doses and lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
The risk of severe, and potentially fatal, irAEs increases as the field moves towards immune/immune and
immune/SOC combination therapies. As the “front line” of tumor/immune interaction, the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is a critical locus of immunomodulation, where the kinds of immunocytes in the TIME
predict the likelihood of response to diverse immunotherapies. One strategy to favorably modulate the TIME is
to localize multiple immunotherapeutics at the tumor through direct intratumoral delivery, reversing the
immunosuppressive TIME while promoting anti-tumor effector cell immunity. This can enhance local
concentration of drugs while minimizing systemic exposure and likelihood and severity of irAEs. The use of
biomaterials as platforms for cancer immunotherapy provides the potential to intelligently direct and modulate
immune cells in situ. Our drug-mimicking, peptide nanofiber hydrogel called “SynerGel” is at the forefront of this
field, with the ability to deplete suppressive immune cells while simultaneously releasing diverse factors in a
controlled manner within a specific volume. These multiple abilities allow for reduced off-target toxicity, dose-
sparing, and targeting of multiple immune pathways to address the heterogeneous nature of cancers. The overall
hypothesis of this proposal is that intratumoral injection of SynerGel renders immunologically refractory tumors
sensitive to immune-mediated killing through multiple mechanisms including: 1) optimization of local
effector/suppressor immunocyte ratios, 2) prolonged release of immune-stimulating agents, and 3) enhanced
activation of recruited effector immunocytes. We propose to improve on the efficacy of our “first generation”
MDP-based hydrogel system by designing a unique injectable, combinatorial immunotherapy platform based on
the drug-mimicking next-generation MDP hydrogel called SynerGel in three aims: Aim 1 will evaluate SynerGel
as an injectable, highly customizable cancer immunotherapy platform able to perform sustained delivery of
multiple immunotherapeutics to the TIME. Aim 2 will explore the immunologic mechanisms contributing to
SynerGel-mediated amelioration of the adverse HNSCC tumor microenvironment. Aim 3 will investigate the
combination of SynerGel immunotherapy with standard-of-care radiotherapy (RT), looking to identify specific
immune mechanisms induced by the combination of RT and immunomodulation, and allowing for effective
therapy de-escalation by eliminating the need for chemotherapy, thus decreasing toxicity. By successfully
accomplishing these aims, we hope to clarify the molecular/cellular mechanisms by which SynerGel can reverse
resistance to both standard-of-care RT and immunomodulatory therapy in solid tumors and provide insights into
how the adverse tumor microenvironment can be rendered more susceptible to immunotherapy."

The Project Summary remains unchanged from the original submission.
Projections indicate that over 50% of the world’s population will have myopia by the year 2050. To develop
successful myopia prevention programs, it is critical to first discern the optical image formation and visual
processing characteristics in children who develop myopia. Considerable evidence points to the quality of the
visual image and absence of blur as the main drivers for normal ocular growth and emmetropization. Human
eyes have complex optical, retinal and visual processing structures and functions. Any and all of these factors
affect the perception of image quality, and may, therefore, be catalysts of the failure to control ocular
elongation and myopia development in children. To better understand the mechanism(s) for the development
of myopia, these factors ought to be measured in the same children over a longitudinal period, prior to and
after the onset of myopia. The immediate objective of this prospective longitudinal study is to tease out retinal
image quality and visual processing factors that may contribute to the development of myopia. We will recruit
two groups of young children, limiting eligibility to only children who are either at high risk or low risk to develop
myopia during the duration of the study. The following factors will be assessed in each child at 6-month
intervals over a period of 3 years: (1) Optical quality of the image formed at the retina. We predict that:
dynamic accommodation is less stable prior to myopia development, causing degraded retinal images; and
children who develop myopia will show degraded image quality across the retina. (2) Retinal responses to
image blur will be measured using pattern electroretinography while subjects observe images blurred with
various types and amounts of simulated optical blur. We predict that children with impaired retinal responses
will develop myopia. (3) Processing of blur will be measured using blur detection and discrimination thresholds
and contrast sensitivity functions across the visual field to the same types of image blur described in (2). We
predict that visual processing of blur will be impaired in children who develop myopia. We will create individual
models of interactions between the three measures: optical image quality, retinal function and visual
processing. We predict that deficits in retinal image quality, retinal function and visual processing or their
interactions lead to a cycle of abnormal representation of blur, which would in turn cause the development of
myopia. Understanding the signals that activate myopia development will have a significant impact and will
help us and other researchers to design future clinical studies for the prevention and control of myopia.
Knowledge of the mechanism(s) for myopia development is essential for the design of effective individualized
interventions in children at risk for myopia, which can be assessed in subsequent clinical trials.

11080124,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy is a painful, debilitating, and chronic tendon pathology. Rehabilitation
exercises are the first treatment option for patients, but clinical studies have reported 20-60% of patients
continue to experience pain and symptoms 5-years later. Even when patients experience symptom relief, only
one-quarter of these patients fully recover muscle-tendon function. Current clinical guidelines recommend
patients perform heel-rise exercises to eccentrically load the pathologic tendon and promote healing. However,
Achilles tendon loading during daily-living often exceeds these structured rehabilitation loads, and the
biomechanical properties of pathologic tendon varies amongst patients. Identifying patient subgroups based on
similarities in tendon loading and biomechanics is a critical next step towards improving patient outcomes and
tendon healing. Our long-term goal is to develop personalized rehabilitation protocols that maximize tendon
recovery following acute and chronic Achilles tendon injuries. The overall objective of this study is to determine
similarities in tendon loading and biomechanics in patients with mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy and how
these similarities affect tendon healing, pain, and functional outcomes. This study leverages innovative
techniques to 1) continuously monitor Achilles tendon loading during rehabilitation and daily-living and 2)
quantify tendon status using ultrasound stress-imaging. Aim 1 will identify groups of patients with Achilles
tendinopathy based on loading patterns and stress-imaging profiles. Aim 2 will determine if tendon healing and
outcomes change over time. Aim 3 will explore the impact of sex on tendon healing and outcomes. This study
will be the first to identify Achilles tendon loading profiles that are associated with tendon healing and
outcomes based on patient-specific factors including tendon biomechanical properties and sex. By measuring
circulating levels of sex hormones, this study will determine if specific levels of estrogen and progesterone –
which can be modified using hormonal contraceptive pills – impact tendon health. Finally, with the recent shift
towards telemedicine, this study will remotely monitor Achilles tendon loading, which has the potential to
expand clinical care beyond patient visits to the clinic."
11068850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop peptide ligands that bind to membrane receptors known to malfunction
in maladies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our preliminary data indicate that we
have designed several peptide ligands that can activate or inhibit different receptors. The basis
of the efficacy of the peptides is that interactions between transmembrane (TM) domains is
critical for receptor function. These peptides are intended to bind to the TM domain of their
target to revert defective receptor activity. Membrane insertion of the peptides is controllable, as
they are triggered by environmental acidity. We will also develop a new generation of peptides
where membrane insertion is triggered by an array of different stimuli. This would provide
means of targeting the peptides to the desired tissues.
To improve our ability to study the interactions between TM domains, we will develop a new
single-molecule method that allows us to obtain stoichiometric and thermodynamic information.
These studies will be complemented with investigation of how TM domains influence lipid
dynamics. In addition to the development of these peptide ligands, we will perform systematic
analyses to understand the molecular mechanism by which similar peptides can activate or
inhibit membrane receptors. Through this work we seek to provide promising new therapeutic
approaches and invaluable functional knowledge of how peptide ligands can modulate disease-
causing membrane receptors."

This application seeks to understand brain network organization and environmental mechanisms underlying risk
and resilience pathways of psychiatric disorders in premature children. Infants born very preterm (VPT; <30
weeks gestation) are 2-4 times more likely than Term Control (TC) children to report ADHD, anxiety, and social-
communication deficits as adolescents. VPT children also show higher rates of internalizing and socioemotional
problems, which are known precursors to later risk for psychiatric disorders. However, a developmental account
of how internalizing symptoms change over time is missing from this literature. Understanding how VPT children
progress along trajectories of internalizing symptoms is necessary to identify sensitive windows when clinical
interventions may be most effective. I propose to use a longitudinal cohort of VPT and TC children followed from
birth to age 10 to examine individual trajectories of internalizing symptoms as a function of neural organization
and individual and environmental factors that may predict risk or resilience. Specifically, I will 1) examine
internalizing trajectories as a function of infant neural organization and dyadic caregiver-child interactions at age
2, 2) model stability and change in dyadic caregiver-child interactions from age 2 to 5 as a function of infant
health risk and maternal stress, and 3) use an autoregressive Cross-Lagged Panel Model to model longitudinal
and transactional relations across internalizing symptoms, neural organization, and dyadic caregiver-child
interactions from birth to age 10. By examining these brain-behavior-context associations with a developmental
lens, we will better capture neurodevelopmental and environmental mechanisms of risk and resilience
translatable for prevention and intervention across typical and atypical populations."

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
being the major subtype accounting for approximately 85% of cases. Effective treatments for NSCLC are
currently lacking due to the complexity of its molecular subtypes and the incomplete understanding of its
underlying mechanisms.
RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is increasingly recognized as being deregulated in human
cancers, however, specific m6A events in NSCLC are yet to be identified. We found elevated m6A modification
on 7SK small nuclear RNA in NSCLC cells and a NSCLC mouse model. Targeted reduction of m6A-7SK
inhibits NSCLC cell growth in soft agar colony formation assays. 7SK regulates RNA Polymerase II (Pol II)
transcription and is a central player in controlling Pol II transcriptional pausing and elongation. Therefore, m6A
modification of 7SK may underlie NSCLC formation and phenotype.
The goal of this study is to dissect the molecular pathways that regulate m6A-7SK and decipher the
mechanisms by which m6A-7SK affects gene regulatory networks in NSCLC. The first aim is to identify the m6A
sites using real-time PCR-based m6A detection assay, and to identify writer and eraser enzymes of 7SK by
short hairpin RNA knockdown. The second aim is to determine how m6A-7SK influences gene expression and
NSCLC formation. CRISPR dCasRx-ALKBH5 fusion protein will be used to modulate m6A-7SK in NSCLC
cells, and cell proliferation and migration assays will be employed. To determine the molecular details of
m6A-7SK-mediated gene regulation, SHAPE-MaP sequencing will probe the structure of m6A-7SK; nascent
RNA-seq, ChIP-seq of Pol II, and ChIRP-seq of 7SK will be performed to survey transcriptional program in
NSCLC cells with different levels of m6A-7SK.
The results of this study will reveal novel molecular details of m6A modifications on 7SK and how they regulate
cancer gene expression. This information will provide the basis for future research to develop novel NSCLC
therapeutics by altering RNA m6A levels."

Centering justice in bioethics is critical to promoting research on the ethical and equitable development and
deployment of emerging biotechnologies. Building capacity for more effective and relevant bioethics
requires not only engagement with multidisciplinary scholarship but also scholars historically
underrepresented in bioethics and in other disciplines and adjacent fields. Few mechanisms exist for
supporting sustained and substantive dialogue on justice and applying frameworks to real-world efforts in
the development and deployment of biotechnologies. This project addresses this gap by creating a
mechanism for trainees across disciplines to engage ethical frameworks that focus on justice and equity,
and to develop an academic network in bioethics. Our proposal aims to build capacity in bioethics research
through sustained and systematic multidisciplinary explorations, dialogues, and the development of
educational materials on justice frameworks. To achieve these objectives, we have two objectives: 1) to
create a hybrid series “Justice Dialogues” a virtual monthly series that will feature speakers whose
scholarship focuses on justice theories and frameworks, and convene scholars from disciplines beyond
bioethics, such as science, technology and society studies, gender and ethnic studies to engage theories
and frameworks of justice and their applications in research of the development and deployment of
biotechnologies, including in genomics, AI, and precision medicine; and 2) to develop and disseminate
educational resources to train scholars and scientists to engage research questions of justice in the ethical
and equitable development and deployment of emerging biotechnologies through a publicly accessible
website dedicated to disseminating recordings of didactic presentations, synchronous group discussions,
curated literature collections and other related resources."

This study investigates the ‘reactive’ immune system in tumors, namely the cellular and molecular allies that
allow immunotherapies to work. In particular it studies cells called ‘cDC1’. The overall hypothesis of this
proposal is that a molecule called Granulin functions to regulate immunity in tumors, through its
expression in these cells.
This program is unique in applying spatial transcriptomics together with genetic tools and conventional cellular
immunoassay methods to understand the critical phenotype-biology relationship between critical cDC
populations and their partners. The resultant discoveries will be formative for designing new ways to boost anti-
tumor immunity."
11054324,"There are national movements to improve the quality of primary care for patients while protecting and
promoting health worker well-being. The critical barrier to realizing these calls for action is that healthcare
systems have struggled to effectively address health worker burnout and turnover, often utilizing low-yield
tactics because of the perceived cost of system level changes. Work needs to be done to address the
fundamental problem – the healthcare working environment. In this proposal, we aim to address the work
environment of federally qualified health centers (FQHC) where critically important care is given to
underserved populations who often have multiple chronic conditions. These centers struggle with employee
retention, which leads to healthcare access and quality challenges for underserved patients. We propose a
multi-method, multi-level investigation of FQHCs to evaluate the safety, health and well-being needs of their
workforce to encourage retention. We will partner with the Colorado Community Health Network (CCHN) – all
Colorado (CO) FQHCs are members and receive support from them – as well as CO practice-based research
networks to recruit FQHCs and their staff to participate. Our project is guided by a vision for a FQHC workforce
that is thriving in an environment that fosters their well-being. Aim 1: Determine how FQHCs can utilize
leadership practices to design work that increases the employee value proposition for existing and future
FQHC staff. Aim 2: Evaluate FQHC primary care workforce well-being using the NIOSH Worker Well-being
Questionnaire (WellBQ) and assess its relationship to turnover intentions. We address AHRQ’s call to
understand approaches to support, develop, retain, and grow the primary care workforce and further
understand and improve their well-being. In the short-term, we will share results and resources with CO
FQHCs for the purpose of helping them identify strengths and opportunities in the way they are supporting their
workforce’s well-being. Our aim is to use our findings to begin to work towards shifting the current clinical
practice of FQHC’s leadership and management of provider and staff well-being towards a systems-based
approach, informed by multi-method and multi-level assessment strategies."

Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately half the human genome is comprised of repetitive DNA sequences that are thought to control a
wide range of cellular functions. DNA repeats are found throughout the genome, and are polymorphic in length
due to their genetic instability. Mutation rates of repeat elements are 101-105 fold higher than in other parts of
the genome, and is triggered by the formation of transient unusual DNA structures (extrahelical extrusions)
during DNA metabolic processes. The detrimental consequences of repeat instability are exemplified by triplet
repeat expansions that cause a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease,
Friedreich’s ataxia and Fragile X related disorders. The rate of expansion of triplet repeats is proportional to
repeat length and sequence homogeneity. DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to maintain genomic stability,
and protect the DNA from damage caused by environmental agents. One such process is DNA mismatch repair
(MMR), a highly conserved antimutagenic pathway that maintains the stability of the human genome by
correcting replication errors and preventing chromosomal rearrangements. Unexpectedly, a mutagenic non-
canonical function of MMR has been implicated as the cause of triplet repeat expansions. Loss of MMR function
attenuates triplet repeat expansion, although the molecular mechanisms of this non-canonical MMR activity are
poorly understood. However, this mutagenic action of MMR requires the proteins MutSb and MutLa (and possibly
MutLg). FAN1 is a deoxyribonuclease that was originally identified as a factor involved in the repair of DNA
interstrand crosslinks. Loss of FAN1 function exacerbates repeat expansion, suggesting a role for FAN1 in
suppression of triplet repeat expansion by mechanisms that are not understood. We are interested in the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the crosstalk between these opposing effects of MMR and FAN1 in the
control of mutation production within triplet repeats. We have discovered a novel activator of the FAN1 nuclease
on triplet repeat extrusions, a finding that represents the first step not only in our understanding of the mechanism
of FAN1 action, but also in our quest to develop a unified understanding of the mechanism of triplet repeat
expansion by integrating biochemical, cellular, and genetic studies. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular
features of FAN1 nuclease function by evaluating the modulatory effects of DNA sequence/structure and protein
co-factors. In Aim 2, we will dissect the role of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions in the repair of triplet
repeat extrusions by FAN1. In Aim 3, we will use unbiased proteomic approaches to identify co-factors that
facilitate FAN1 nuclease function in a cellular milieu. Completion of these studies will shed light on the pathways
that modulate triplet repeat expansion, and will have implications more broadly for the mechanisms of genome
instability.

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), consisting of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD),
are chronic progressive inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Numerous lines of evidence suggest
their origins lie in an overaggressive response of the host immune system towards the gut microbiota
in a genetically susceptible host. We hypothesize a key feature of IBD is the persistent colonization
by colitogenic microbial strains in the absence of sufficient colitoprotective strains that over years to
decades can drive the progressive inflammation and damage associated with IBD. To test this
hypothesis we propose three Aims. In Aim 1, we will sample, every year for five years, the fecal
microbiota of individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (UC or CD) and healthy controls. To
understand the implications of gut microbiota stability in the context of a gut microbiota manipulation
intervention, we will also longitudinally sample recipients of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for
ulcerative colitis, after FMT therapy has ended, for up to 5 years. We will use metagenomics
combined with high throughput microbial isolation and genome sequencing to identify the stable and
transient microbes in each individual's microbiota and determine if individuals with IBD have
significantly altered gut microbiota stability. We will also track the loss of engrafted FMT donor strains
in subjects in remission post-FMT overtime to associate strain loss with long-term-relapse. In Aim 2,
we will use gnotobiotic T-cell transfer colitis mice colonized with subsets of each microbiota to identify
colitogenic and colitoprotective microbial strains and to determine if colitogenic or colitoprotective
organisms are preferentially found in the stably colonized community members. We will also
determine if colitogenic and colitoprotective strains drive unique baseline immune tones when
colonized in unchallenged gnotobiotic mice. With an aim towards future human translation, we will
search for minimal colitoprotective subsets from previously identified colitoprotective communities,
and we will determine if strains lost post-FMT are colitoprotective, in UC subjects that achieve
remission but subsequently relapse. Together these aims will help us determine if individuals with
Inflammatory Bowel Disease are enriched in stably colonized colitogenic organisms whose
elimination might form a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment or prevention of Inflammatory
Bowel Disease and if healthy individuals are enriched in stably colonized colitoprotective organisms
that might form the basis of a novel IBD therapeutic."
11050459,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studies in humans suggest that Neurexin1α (Nrxn1α), a presynaptically expressed organizer of synaptic
structure, is a key genetic risk factor for multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, all of which exhibit impairments in
goal-directed processing. Given the pernicious effects of goal-directed dysfunction on daily quality of life, a better
understanding of the underlying neurobiology – both at the molecular and neural circuit level - is strongly
warranted. Our prior work has developed quantitative behavioral and in vitro electrophysiological approaches
while demonstrating that mice with mutations in Nrxn1α are an excellent system to study alterations in neural
circuit activity driving impaired goal-directed behavior. Efficient goal-directed behavior relies on reinforcement,
whereby outcomes shape future actions, as well as flexibility, the ability to adapt to changes in contingencies or
context. Both processes are thought to occur in part within the striatum, where excitatory inputs representing
choice-relevant information interact with neuromodulators, such as dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh),
which signal information about rewards, surprise, and uncertainty from the external world. Nrxn1 is broadly
expressed in these cortico-striatal-thalamic circuits including the presynaptic terminals of striatal-targeting
cortical and thalamic neurons, as well as within striatal cholinergic interneurons and striatal-targeting
dopaminergic projections from the midbrain. Here we examine how Nrxn1 functions within midbrain dopamine
neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons, the major sources of striatal dopamine and acetylcholine,
respectively. We employ cell type specific Nrxn1 deletion together with acute slice recordings to mechanistically
address how Nrxn1 contributes to the striatal release of these key neuromodulators. In parallel, we use in vivo
imaging of novel sensors for dopamine and acetylcholine to investigate how these modulators are altered during
value-based choice tasks in both circuit-specific and brain-wide Nrxn1 KOs. We will correlate abnormal
neuromodulatory signals with abnormalities in choice behavior, focusing on reinforcement processes and choice
flexibility. To probe the functional relevance of altered neuromodulatory signals for behavior, we optogenetically
impose abnormal ACh and DA signals in WT mice and observe impacts on choice selection and flexibility. Finally,
we examine how Nrxn1 mutations impact striatal processing during selection of actions via in vivo recordings
in wildtype and Nrxn1 KO mice. The proposed work will inform us of how mutations in Nrxn1 alter striatal
cholinergic and dopaminergic signals and striatal processing of goal-directed actions, while providing a
framework to understand the diversity of goal-directed dysfunction seen across neuropsychiatric disorders."
11052927,"Project Summary
Behavior dysregulation emerges early in life, is persistent, and often has lasting associations with more
intractable symptoms of child psychopathology. Attempting to isolate early risk factors is difficult due to the
varying presentations of behavior dysregulation, including comorbidities, differing developmental trajectories,
and varying responses to treatments. Consequently, it is vital to isolate early developmental risk groups by
characterizing early risk mechanisms in clearly identifiable subgroups at risk for behavioral disorders, such as
children with prenatal nicotine exposure. These children are at least 1.5 times more likely to develop attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD, and often display early attention, motor, and sleep dysregulation
commonly associated with the disorder. Yet, the etiological pathways from infant risk factors to later behavior
dysregulation are unclear. Attention, motor, and sleep behavior are transdiagnostic constructs that are
hypothesized to underlie many behavioral disorders, including ADHD, and internalizing and externalizing
disorders. Thus, they may be important phenotypic markers predicting early behavior dysregulation. This
K99/R00 proposal will help to identify infants who may develop persistent behavior dysregulation from infants
exhibiting transient behaviors or no/low risk symptoms through multiple Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
constructs. This project seeks to incorporate more sensitive, scalable, and automated measure to identify
behavior dysregulation earlier in development than current assessments allow. The first aim (K99) will leverage
integrative data analysis techniques to identify modifiable, RDoC-informed mechanisms that increase risk for
behavior dysregulation in toddlers. Through data aggregation and advanced statistical techniques, this project
will uncover meaningful insights from a large integrated cohort (N > 3,000) composed of multiple independent
datasets on nicotine exposure during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcomes from birth to 3 years of
age. The second aim (R00) will track trajectories and timing of attention, motor, and sleep behavior using early,
sensitive, and scalable measures to pinpoint risk for later behavior dysregulation in infants exposed to nicotine
in utero. For this aim, we will recruit a new sample of birthing parents and infants across the first postnatal year
(< 5 days old, and 4-, 8-, and 12-month-old infants) to characterize trajectories of attention, motor, and sleep to
determine how these trajectories predict risk for behavior dysregulation at 1-year of age. To accomplish these
aims, the mentored training will focus on furthering knowledge on the risk phenotypes of behavior
dysregulation, and data harmonization and advanced causal modeling. This project will provide advanced
training to support future research on using sensitive, scalable, and automated measures to detect risk for
psychopathology in early childhood. It will also aid in prevention and intervention efforts by isolating early
mechanisms of risk, as well as malleable behavioral targets, a NIMH priority (Strategic Objective 2.2)."
11055062,"SUMMARY
Adaptive evolution (AE) is both a “force of good” as it can help to optimize biological processes in industry, but
it is also a “force of frustration” when infectious diseases exploit AE to escape the host immune system or become
resistant to drugs. It has long been assumed close to impossible to make predictions on AE due to the presumed
predominating influences of random forces and events. However, the observation that evolutionary repeatability
across traits and species is far more common than previously thought, suggests that AE, with the right data and
approach, may become (partially) predictable. Indeed, we found through experiments with the bacterial pathogen
Streptococcus pneumoniae on its response to antibiotics and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, that in
order to make AE predictable a detailed understanding of at least two aspects of the bacterial system are required:
1.) the genetic constraints of the system (i.e. the architecture of the organismal network); and 2.) where and how
in the system stress is experienced and processed. We showed that by mapping out ~25% of the bacterium's
network, determining phenotypic and transcriptional antibiotic responses, applying network analyses to capture
and quantify the responses in a network context, and exploiting experimental evolution to pin-point adaptive
mutations in the genome it becomes possible, by means of machine learning, to uncover hidden patterns in the
data that make AE predictions feasible. This means that the network in interaction with the environment shapes
the adaptive landscape, it limits available solutions and makes some solutions more likely than others, thereby
driving repeatability and enabling predictability. In this proposal we build on these exciting developments
with the goal to map out the constraints of S. pneumoniae's entire network and develop a machine
learning model that can forecast adaptive evolution a priori, and on a genome-wide scale. To accomplish
this, we combine in aim 1 parts of Tn-Seq, dTn-Seq and Drop-Seq to finalize a new tool Tn-Seq^2 (Tn-Seq
squared) that is able to map genetic-interactions in high-throughput and genome-wide. We use Tn-Seq^2 to
reconstruct the first genome-wide genetic interaction network for S. pneumoniae in the presence of 20 antibiotics.
In aim 2 we create 85 HA-tagged Transcription factor induction (TFI) strains and: a) Determine with ChIP-Seq
the DNA-binding sites for all 85 TFs in S. pneumoniae; b) By overexpressing each TFI strain followed by RNA-
Seq we determine each TFs regulatory signature; c) Use a Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype screen
in the presence of 20 antibiotics to untangle environment specific links between genetic and transcriptional
perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes. Lastly, in aim 3, we train and test a variety of machine learning
approaches to design an optimal model that predicts which genes in the genome are most likely to adapt in the
presence of a specific antibiotic. The development of this predictive AE model, will not only be useful in predicting
the emergence of antibiotic resistance, but the strategy should be valuable for most any biological field for which
adaptive changes are important, ranging from biological engineering to cancer."
11056677,"United States Veterans have disproportionately higher risk for end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to
the general population. Veterans with ESRD on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) suffer from alarmingly high
mortality rates and hospitalizations mainly related to cardiovascular disease. Extracellular volume (ECV)
excess is a primary contributing factor to cardiovascular disease and the heightened mortality rate in HD
patients. Extracellular volume excess remains difficult to identify in clinical practice, and the standard
approach to fluid management in the clinical setting involves arbitrary trial and error attempts to remove fluid
without invoking hemodynamic instability such as intradialytic hypotension. Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS)
is a useful research tool for assessing ECV; however, it is not feasible in routine practice, and there is little data
on how its use affects intermediate and hard clinical outcomes. There is an unmet need for an approach to
guide ultrafiltration in clinical practice that addresses both reduction of ECV and other mortality outcomes as
well as minimization of intradialytic hypotension. The long-term goal of this study is to develop a more precise,
patient-specific fluid management approach to be tested in a large clinical trial aimed at reducing mortality in
Veterans on HD. The overall objective of this project is to utilize our novel, patient-specific ultrafiltration
algorithm as an intervention in a clinical trial using mortality risk factors as the primary outcomes. The central
hypothesis is that prescribing ultrafiltration prospectively based on an individual patient’s intradialytic blood
pressure slopes (IBPS) from recent treatments is superior to standard care at reducing ambulatory blood
pressure and ECV without increasing risk for intradialytic hypotension. Aim 1 will use an un-blinded, controlled
randomized clinical trial to demonstrate the effects of an IBPS-based ultrafiltration prescription compared to
standard clinical practice. Each month, updated ultrafiltration prescriptions for the IBPS group will be
determined based on the most recent treatment data. The primary outcome will be change in mean systolic
44-hour ambulatory blood pressure after 4 months. Other outcomes will include 1) change in post-HD
ECV/body weight using multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy, 2) change in post-HD total peripheral
resistance index using a non-invasive cardiac output monitor, and 3) between-group comparison of the
frequency of intradialytic hypotension and intradialytic symptoms. Aim 2 will involve a cross sectional analysis
of baseline data of subjects from Aim 1 in addition to consecutive enrollment of additional hypertensive HD
patients. In addition to Aim 1 measurements, subjects will undergo transthoracic echocardiograms on a non-
HD day to obtain measurements of left ventricular ejection fraction as a metric of systolic function, mitral inflow
and mitral annulus velocities as a metric of diastolic function, and left ventricular mass index. Mixed linear
models will be used to determine how these metrics independently influence the association between
ECV/body weight and IBPS. The strength of the association between IBPS and ECV/body weight will then be
determined within each tertile of the distributions of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Finally, there will be an
assessment of how the echocardiogram based metrics influence the likelihood of intradialytic hypotension with
prospective follow up while controlling for ECV/body weight. If successful, this study will provide nephrologists
with an easily-implemented, individualized approach to fluid management in Veterans on HD that safely
reduces ECV excess and related mortality risk factors. Because no approach currently exits, this could
immediately change clinical practice of managing Veterans with ESRD. The long term impact will be the
opportunity to utilize the data generated to design a large, multi-center trial directly evaluating this
intervention’s effect on mortality in Veterans with ESRD on HD. The observed reduction in blood pressure can
be used to determine expected mortality, while the echocardiogram data can be used to determine phenotypes
of patients that may need to be considered for inclusion/exclusion criteria."
11057349,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The parent R01 of this proposed supplement Project SMART (Social Media Anti-
Vaping Messages to Reduce ENDS Use Among Sexual and Gender Minority Teens; R01DA054236-01) is to
evaluate the effectiveness of an SGM-tailored social media intervention to prevent vaping initiation among
SGM youth ages 13-18 years. Scientific Rationale: Although the use of social branding has been utilized in
cigarette smoking education campaigns among SGM young adults, this approach has not yet been explored
for vaping education campaigns intended for SGM youth. Objectives: The overall objective of this supplement
in response to PA-20-272 is to explore strategies used by social media influencers (SMIs) to engage with SGM
youth and factors related to collaborating with health organizations in health education campaigns. The long-
term goal is to increase the reach and impact of Project SMART's anti-vaping social media intervention to
reduce vaping susceptibility and initiation among SGM youth. Based on Social Branding Theory and the
Integrative Model of Social Media Influencers (SMIs), our specific aims are to: 1) Explore the strategies SMIs
used for content creation and distribution, specifically focusing on social branding efforts to increase message
authenticity, relatedness, and credibility and engage SGM youth on social media platforms and 2) Investigate
facilitators for SMIs' collaboration with health organizations on future social media-based vaping education
interventions for SGM youth, focusing on influencers' interests, motivations, and potential strategies for
creating and delivering SGM-tailored vaping prevention messages. Research Strategy: We will first conduct a
survey among 100 SMIs to describe influencers' current strategies and prior experiences with creating and
distributing health-related social media content that resonate with SGM youth and their interest, motivation,
and expectations if they were to partner with health organizations on a vaping prevention campaign for SGM
youth. Following the survey data analysis, we will purposively invite 8-10 SMIs from those expressing interest
in collaborating on vaping prevention for SGM youth in the survey study for in-depth interviews to explore how
SMIs define, implement, and integrate important message and source characteristics into their own post
creation and delivery and obtain SMIs' suggestions and recommendations on vaping prevention messages
aimed at SGM youth, understand factors SMIs consider like motivations and barriers concerning potential
collaboration with researchers and health organizations in co-creating and disseminating effective social
media-based vaping prevention messages for SGM youth. Impact: The expected outcomes of this supplement
include a detailed understanding of influencers' current strategies for engaging SGM youth on social media
platforms, their interest in collaborating on tailored vaping prevention interventions for SGM youth, insights for
refining vaping prevention messages from the Project SMART Aim 3 study, and comprehensive guidelines for
future partnerships with influencers in social media-based vaping prevention efforts aimed at SGM youth."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, disability, and death in the elderly. Despite recent
advances in our understanding of basic biological mechanisms underlying AD, we do not yet know how to prevent
AD or have an approved disease modifying intervention. Animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have
provided important insights into the pathophysiology of disease and suggested potential avenues for therapies;
however, translation of these findings to the clinic has been largely unsuccessful. The MODEL-AD Consortium
was initiated to generate and validate the next generation of mouse models of late-onset Alzheimer's disease
(LOAD) as well as to perform rigorous preclinical testing of the most promising therapeutics in these models.
Based on advances in human disease characterization driven by genetic, molecular, and imaging studies, we
have created more than 40 LOAD mouse models carrying genetic risk variants. These models have been
characterized using the same molecular and imaging modalities used in the clinic, revealing LOAD-relevant
phenotypes not observed in prior mouse models. The IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center is now poised to leverage
these existing models, protocols, and data to further our mission of creating translatable preclinical tools. The
Indiana University (IU)/Jackson Laboratory (JAX)/University of Pittsburgh (IU/JAX/PITT) will leverage IU's and
PITT's strengths in neurodegenerative research including 30+ years as an NIA-supported Alzheimer's Disease
Center (ADRC) and considerable expertise in preclinical drug testing with JAX's eight decades of expertise in
mammalian genetics and disease modeling to develop, validate and disseminate new, precise animal models of
AD. In addition, the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center contains Sage Bionetworks to provide expertise in data
organization and dissemination. The IU/JAX ADPMC brings together an international, multi-disciplinary team—
including geneticists and genetics technology experts, quantitative and computational biologists, clinical experts
in AD and neuroimaging, pharmacologists and world leaders in the development of precision animal models of
disease—that possesses the collective ability to foresee disease modeling needs as they emerge on the
international stage. This will allow the IU/JAX ADPMC to serve the AD scientific community effectively and
efficiently. Ultimately, this will accelerate the application of advances in animal models for the greatest possible
medical benefit. The Specific Aims of the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center are:
Aim 1: Prioritize genetic variants, analyze model data, and broadly disseminate results through data
sharing and online analytics.
Aim 2: Creating and characterizing novel LOAD models
Aim 3: Screening of novel compounds through the PTC pipeline.
Aim 4: Coordinate activities within the center, the MODEL-AD consortium, and across the broader
community of AD/ADRD researchers."
11055660,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and glia-driven neuroinflammation is a key element in the
pathogenesis of glaucoma. Increasing evidence from clinical studies indicate that primary open-angle glaucoma
is linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex-IV, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and
Cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase, suggesting that TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation, cholesterol efflux and/or
OXPHOS stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction play roles in glaucoma pathogenesis. ApoA-I binding
protein (AIBP), encoded by the APOA1BP gene, is a secreted protein, which serves as a selective regulator of
cellular cholesterol metabolism, targeting inflammatory cells via its binding to TLR4. Cholesterol depletion from
inflammatory cells reduces lipid raft abundance and the membrane occupancy of receptors (such as TLR4) that
mediate inflammatory signaling. Emerging evidence from our group showed that AIBP deficiency is associated
with glia-driven inflammatory TLR4/interleukin-1β signaling axis and mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucomatous
degeneration. In addition to protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) against neuroinflammation, AIBP prevents
RGC mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated
that AIBP expression is highly reduced in glaucomatous human and mouse RGCs and their axons, as well as
Müller glia, and that amplification of retinal AIBP expression by adeno-associated virus delivery protects RGCs
and preserves visual function in experimental glaucoma in vivo. In addition, treatment with recombinant AIBP
protein promotes mitochondrial function in Müller glia against elevated pressure in vitro. Based on our previous
and these findings, we propose to test the novel concept that AIBP controls retinal neuroinflammation and the
RGC mitochondrial dysfunction, which lead to glaucomatous neurodegeneration, as well as to test the
therapeutic potential of raising AIBP expression in the retina. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) to define
the mechanisms by which AIBP controls TLR4-lipid raft activation in inflammatory Müller glial cells; (2) to
determine the protective mechanisms of AIBP amplification on mitochondrial network and bioenergetics in
glaucomatous RGCs and Müller glial cells; and (3) to determine how therapeutic augmentation of AIBP
expression impacts structural integrity and synapses linking RGCs and the central visual pathway. Our proposed
studies will explore novel pathways which potentially link neuroinflammation regulation to elevated IOP-mediated
mitochondrial function and cellular cholesterol metabolism. This work may also lead to the development of a new
glaucoma therapy."
11038279,"Acute lymphocytic leukemia, a blood cancer, is most common among children under five and is treated with chemotherapy. Neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening complication following chemotherapy with high mortality rates in newborns with an incidence rate of up to 46%. CT is used to diagnose NEC but has limited availability, reduced sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, continuous CT monitoring is not feasible due to the risks involving multiple exposures to ionizing doses. Ultrasound is a viable low-cost, and safe alternative. However, its adoption suffers from several challenges that include the sonography protocol’s complexity, high inter and intra-user variability, and inability to track longitudinal changes throughout treatment. We propose ODIN, a guidance, detection, auto-capture, and measurement system that guides and captures high-quality images from POCUS devices to automate the detection of thickened bowel walls. It minimizes measurement variability across different patient cohorts and due to operators. Moreover, it utilizes deep learning models with interpretable features to generate explainable decisions and provide longitudinal insights."
11056994,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 2 million Americans suffer from Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and another 9 million misuse opioids.
Treatments for opioid addiction exist, but effectiveness is compromised when subjects use illicit opiates during
treatment. Reuse rates during treatment can be high, and reducing illicit opiate use during treatment has thus
recently become a major NIDA policy goal. Elevated reuse rates not only compromise treatment effectiveness,
but this behavior predicts, and likely drives, treatment dropout. With the support of a NIDA basic science R01,
we developed a set of easy-to-use instruments that predict opioid reuse events with about twice the accuracy of
any existing tool. The 5-minute battery we developed indicates the numerical probability that a patient will reuse
illicit opiates within the next 7-10 days. In a pilot cohort, we successfully migrated this battery to a commercial
smartphone platform, and demonstrated 100% retention and >85% compliance (median compliance > 95%) over
a use period of up to 4 months. In a survey of our largely homeless MOUD patients we found that 85% already
had smartphones and data contracts appropriate for using this platform as a part of their treatment. In a survey
of OUD treatment physicians, we found that our system and the reuse prediction it provides, was both highly
desirable and usable as implemented. Finally, we found in a reanalysis of data from CTN-0051 that dynamic
dosing of this very kind reduces relapse rates. Our primary goal in this mid-scale clinical trial is to test the
hypothesis that clinicians who use the output of our mobile system to adjust buprenorphine and methadone
dosing achieve lower opiate reuse rates than physicians who provide care-as-usual. Our secondary goal is to
examine the usability and desirability of this solution for clinicians with an eye to usability and large-scale
deployment. Our third and final goal is to measure the cost-effectiveness of this solution from multiple
perspectives. If we are successful it will be possible to employ an algorithmic and measurement-based approach
to OUD treatment with methadone and buprenorphine which reduces reuse rates and relapse rates amongst
OUD patients."

Traumatic social experience in humans can impair brain reward function leading to severe social avoidance.
Rodent stress models such as chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), can also cause severe social-avoidance
mediated, in part, through altered reward circuit function. One of the prominent questions arising from such
rodent studies is whether such social avoidance behaviors occurs due to a loss of social reward or preference.
Using a standard CSDS model, we measured social interaction with threatening (aggressive CD-1 mice) and
non-threatening (same sex 3-week old juvenile C57BL6/J mice) social target mice. We find that CSDS leads to
social avoidance to both threatening and non-threatening social targets in a subset of male and female mice
termed susceptible. Control and resilient mice do not exhibit social avoidance to either target mouse. To
measure social reward, we utilized a social conditioned place preference (CPP) assay, where experimental mice
were conditioned with a same sex 3-week old juvenile C57BL6/J. We find that that CSDS impairs formation of
social CPP in susceptible, but not resilient, male and female mice. We next used whole brain iDisco clearing and
c-Fos mapping following juvenile social interaction in CSDS-exposed mice and found several brain regions with
increased c-Fos expression specifically in susceptible mice. The lateral septum (LS)—a stress responsive brain
region—was highly activated in susceptible mice, but not resilient or control mice. We performed in situ
hybridization to identify specific cell types in the LS and found a neurotensin (LSNT) positive GABAergic
population activated during juvenile social interaction only in susceptible mice. We next utilized in vivo fiber
photometry and GCAMP6-mediated Ca2+ imaging along with and chemogenetics to confirm that LSNT neurons
are activated in real-time during juvenile social interaction and they regulate social avoidance and social CPP.
To determine downstream LSNT connections, we used predicted correlation matrices from iDisco c-Fos
expression maps to identify functionally connected regions and then confirmed these connections with viral
tracing tools and optogenetics. We found a functional connection between LSNT neurons and the nucleus
accumbens shell/nucleus of the diagonal band that regulates social interaction. Our research provides a circuit-
level framework to understanding deficits in social behavior, that are common among many stress-related
illnesses, such as depression."

The primary objective of the proposal is to identify the initial regions in the brain affected by Alzheimer's
disease (AD), focusing on the entorhinal cortex (EC) and locus coeruleus (LC). These areas are known to
accumulate tau pathology, leading to cognitive impairment. The researchers plan to use advanced techniques
to record the electrophysiological properties of EC and LC neurons in App knockin mice, aiming to understand
how pathology contributes to neuronal dysfunction, sleep disruption, and memory impairment. They also intend
to use new tools for visualizing gene expression in intact tissue using spatial transcriptomics, specifically 10X
Visium technology, to study transcriptomic changes in these vulnerable brain regions.
The proposal includes two specific aims: Aim 1 involves the transcriptomic analysis of the LC region in AD
mice, with the goal of understanding how tauopathy affects the electrophysiological properties of the LC and
downstream regions. The researchers expect to see changes in genes related to novelty response, arousal,
and sleep. Aim 2 focuses on the transcriptomic analysis of the MEC region in AD mice, aiming to understand
how amyloid beta and tau pathology change gene expression in the MEC. The researchers anticipate changes
in genes involved in maintaining memory processes. These aims will provide valuable transcriptomic profiling
of the two vulnerable brain regions, significantly benefiting the parent proposal."
11063308,"For individuals with a broad range of disability, illness, or injury, skin health can be challenging to
 maintain. One devastating result is the high national incidence and impact of pressure injuries. The
 annual cost of hospital acquired pressure injuries is estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. These
injuries are painful for the individual and result in up to 60,000 US deaths annually. Pressure injuries are
 largely preventable through timely cleaning and frequent, consistent skin inspection. This serious health
 issue has received considerable attention across the US, yet the impact of pressure injuries remains
largely unchanged.
This project proposes advances in the engineering and psychology of human-robot skin contact towards
introducing robots into the healthcare system as skin-care assistants with the goals of improving skin
health for individuals who are unable to perform bathing and skin care on their own. This project will
develop a novel individual representation of skin-care tasks that can be modified by a user with limited
motor functions. It will provide the first ever database that captures detailed hand movement and contact
pressures as expert caregivers perform skin-care tasks. It will result in novel reasoning and control
methods that enable the robotic assistant to interact safely with people. It will provide novel interaction
mechanisms for diverse individuals with disabilities and new findings on their preferences for working with
the robotic assistant. A unique soft robot hand will be developed to support these efforts.
Reducing the incidence and impact of pressure injuries can reduce pain and improve health outcomes for
individuals. It can save lives and billions of dollars to be applied to better uses in the health care system.
It can elevate and democratize access to skin health through consistency, implementation of best
practices, and individualized inspection algorithms. It can relieve burdens on caregivers, increase
privacy, allow individuals to live in their homes for a longer time and provide greater independence.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 A robotic skin-care assistant can provide consistent skin cleaning and inspection for individuals that
 require such assistance. Consistent skin cleaning and inspection is the number one means of
 preventing pressure injuries and lessening their impact. Accomplishing the project goal can save lives,
 prevent painful injuries, save billions of dollars, and save caregiver time while empowering individuals and
 democratizing access to good skin care."
11063327,"Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in wearable sensors that detect biomarkers in a
continuous and non-invasive manner from biofluids such as sweat. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the
 second-most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States, and early diagnosis and
management of the disease course of PD remains an urgent task. Among all biomarker types, the sweat
 metabolites, peptides, and anions can reflect both the phenotypic states of cells or organs and their
 dynamic responses to external stimuli, such as drug treatment. However, significant technical challenges
exist in developing sweat metabolic biomarkers and wearable sweat sensors in PD monitoring: 1) lack of
 known biomarkers and accurate whole metabolomic and peptide profiles in PD patients' sweat; 2) the
 selected biomarkers need to be optimized for PD system and sensor technology; 3) current wearable
sweat sensors fall short in sensitivity. This project aims to fill these gaps by proposing a novel framework
for predicting and optimizing the PD metabolic biomarkers using large-scale multi-omics data, to innovate
 non-invasive wearable sweat sensor with high sensitivity and specificity. Specifically, the biomarker
 panels and sweat sensor will be developed by bridging state-of-the-art AI and nanotechnologies to assist
the diagnosis and monitoring of PD, and will be validated clinically. The proposed research will provide an
 integrative infrastructure for developing novel PD biomarkers and non-invasive personal wearable
 devices. We will develop computational methods to solve a set of unaddressed questions in biomarker
 discovery, namely identification of PD-specific functional variations, prediction of metabolites and peptides
 in body fluids, and optimization of biomarker selection for personal wearable sensor (Aim 1). We will gain
 fundamental knowledge and technical capabilities in designing, processing, and optimizing of 2D
materials-based wearable sensors for versatile applications. A physics-based, data-driven protocol will be
 developed to reveal the fundamental process-structure-property-performance relation for wearable
sensors (Aim 2). We will develop new biomarker sets and wearable sweat sensors and test the
performance in assisting diagnosis and monitoring of PD, which could be extended to other
biological/disease systems (Aim 3). This proposed study will fill the gaps of disease-specific biomarker
 prediction and 2D material optimization in developing a clinically applicable non-invasive wearable device."
11068586,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cells have evolved intricate enzymatic machineries that help them exist and survive redox stresses in their
microenvironment. Enzymatic redox sense, signal, and response mechanisms are critical for a diverse set of
physiological processes in all forms of life ranging from bacteria and plants to humans. Unlike other cellular
signaling processes, redox signaling involves highly reactive reagents such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon
monoxide (CO), and reactive oxygen species that raise concerns regarding the potential of these reagents for
participation in other non-specific reactions. Yet, such side reactions are uncommon under physiological
conditions suggesting high specificity and selectivity of enzymatic redox signal transduction pathways. In turn,
we ask the following two pertinent questions: a) What makes redox signaling pathways so specific? and b) Can
we rationally and systematically rewire redox signal transduction pathways to re-instate/disrupt cellular redox
balance? These questions have been largely overlooked from the chemical biology and bioinorganic chemistry
perspective, despite the fact that redox imbalances are responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from
neurological disorders to cancer. Our lab focuses on these paradigm shifting questions and the long-term goal
of our research program is to develop molecular strategies that rewire sensing/signaling mechanisms of
biological redox reagents involved in human health and disease. In this proposal, we focus on DosS-DosR
enzymatic signaling pathway in mycobacteria that senses NO/CO in its microenvironment and signals cellular
transition into a non-replicating, dormant state. The DosS-DosR system has three components – a heme iron
sensing domain that binds to NO/CO, a zinc-dependent signaling kinase domain that communicates the binding
event and a response domain that binds to DNA and turns on dormancy. Using our combined expertise in
metalloprotein structure-function, protein engineering, enzymology and spectroscopy, we will devise mutagenic,
metal-substitution and peptidomimetic-based approaches to rewire DosS-DosR sense, signal and response
domains. Proof-of-concept studies conducted in our laboratory have demonstrated successful rewiring of DosS-
DosR redox sensing function via structure-guided rational protein design. Future work will unravel the molecular
mechanisms of redox rewiring and its implications on cellular physiology and phenotypic responses. Our findings,
will not only provide a fundamental understanding of cellular redox sense/signal/response mechanisms, but also
inform future methodologies for treatment and prevention of redox-related diseases.
Health Relevance: Maintenance of a normal intracellular redox status is crucial for regulating physiological
responses. Any imbalance in this status results in a variety of acute and chronic degenerative diseases such as
cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Our research program aims to design molecular approaches
that rewires the ability of cells to sense and signal redox changes in their environment. These approaches could
be applied to re-instate cellular redox homeostasis in diseased states."
11055688,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Transgender youth are 2-3 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety and 6 times more
likely to attempt suicide relative to cisgender youth. These mental health inequities are exacerbated by mental
healthcare barriers, such as discrimination. Negative mental healthcare experiences are associated with lower
treatment engagement for transgender youth, including high dropout and low satisfaction. Conversely, mental
healthcare that is gender-affirming - that which addresses the needs and experiences of transgender people -
is associated with strong treatment engagement and better outcomes, relative to non-affirming treatments.
Despite the positive impacts of gender-affirming mental healthcare, it is rarely provided. To address this void in
mental healthcare, we developed and pilot-tested Gender-Affirming Psychotherapy (GAP), an
intervention consisting of research-informed principles and skills that augment mental health
treatment to address transgender youth’s needs. Examples of intervention skills include: using affirmed
names, using preferred pronouns, and avoiding invasive questions. In a pilot trial situated in a medium-sized
mental health clinic (K23MH124670), GAP demonstrated strong acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness.
A 10-hour implementation package (i.e., combination of strategies) encompassed within a self-paced online
training, was also delivered across 2 months. The package included 5 discrete implementation strategies: (1)
didactics, (2) patient stories, (3) practice, (4) incentives, and (5) an organizational support message. It
demonstrated acceptability and feasibility, and was effective in improving provider attitudes, knowledge,
self-efficacy (implementation mechanisms) and GAP adoption (implementation outcome). As the next step in
efficiently and pragmatically promoting mental health equity for transgender youth, we will conduct a trial to
optimize an implementation package to increase GAP adoption in large healthcare systems in places
with varying transphobia levels. In Aim 1, we will validate the conceptual model of GAP implementation and
effectiveness for large healthcare systems, using data from n=726 providers and n=1071 transgender patients
from two large healthcare systems. In Aim 2, we will identify an optimized GAP implementation package, which
will be the package with the fewest costs relative to implementation success. Finally, in Aim 3, we will explore
structural transphobia as a moderator of GAP implementation and effectiveness to determine whether GAP
implementation and/or intervention needs differ in high (vs. low) structural transphobia regions."

Its use in pediatric oncology is hindered by the high radiation dose required, posing risks to children. This proposal addresses this unmet need in pediatric cancer with an innovative, high-performance gamma-ray detection system.  Our novel system focuses on pediatric and rare cancers with poor survival rates (<50%). By significantly reducing radiation exposure (anticipated >100 times less than current), our system aims to enhance detection accuracy for leading pediatric cancers: lymphomas, brain tumors, sarcomas, neuroblastoma, Wilms’ tumor, germ cell tumors, and neurofibromatosis. 

The funding from this program will be used to identify and optimize the most viable substrate technologies for an advanced TOF-PET detector. This endeavor comprises individual design / development, procurement, evaluation, and optimization of each component, followed by limited testing using a de-mountable test stand developed during this program in partnership with SWRI. Collaboration with SCHOTT glass on the laser structured MCP work and LMCP development will be the primary focus."

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in the world with the largest survivorship group. The rise of breast
cancer survivors (BCS) living longer, healthier lives merits attention to important areas of cancer survivorship
such as employment and physical activity. Employment is associated quality of life, health insurance, treatment
adherence and recovery, and financial security. Cancer-related fatigue and cognitive impairment are two
frequent barriers to working, but current literature shows they are alleviated by physical activity (PA). Limited
studies have shown disproportionate adverse health outcomes among Black BCS living in the rural South and
much is still unknown. Common drivers behind these adverse outcomes experienced by Black BCS include
discrimination and accessibility to exercise opportunities. Therefore, we will: (1) identify work disparities, (2)
determine the relationships between PA and work outcomes, and the role of fatigue, cognition, discrimination,
and accessibility to exercise opportunities, using structural equation modeling and mediation analysis, and (3)
use semi-structured interviews to better understand the PA-work life relationship and identify barriers and
facilitators of desired program elements to apply to multilevel tailored intervention design. The proposed
research strategy will build the foundation for tailored, comprehensive intervention design to reduce cancer
health and employment disparities and help ALL cancer survivors live longer, healthier lives. The proposed
training period will allow applied learning and formal training in (1) cancer disparity research, (2) mediation
analysis with structural equation modeling, (3) qualitative research for intervention design. These training
opportunities will enhance my research capability to establish independence leading to significant contributions
in the fight towards eliminating health inequities for cancer survivors. I have assembled an exceptional
mentoring team, in an outstanding training environment to achieve my training goals and career transition. This
K01 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in cancer disparities and behavioral health."

 Although BRAIN 2.0 called for the BRAIN Initiative to “prioritize diversity and inclusion as a fundamental
pillar,” research with the human neuroimaging technologies being developed by BRAIN Initiative continues to
rely on non-representative convenience samples. This raises neuroethics concerns related to access and justice,
and scientific concerns because non-representative samples undermine most key assumptions supporting
causal inference in research. Our proposal for Improving Recruitment, Engagement, and Access for Community
Health Equity for BRAIN Next-Generation Human Neuroimaging Research and Beyond (REACH for BRAIN) will
directly address these ethical and scientific challenges. REACH for BRAIN will utilize community engagement
with Black and Latinx stakeholder networks, to co-create evidence-based solutions and ethical guidance to
expand the inclusiveness of participation in NIH BRAIN research and human neuroimaging studies more broadly.
 Aim 1: Utilizing a stakeholder network, Outcome Map, and Theory of Change (ToC) already established in
pilot work, and initially targeting recruitment for research with the BRAIN Initiative supported Connectome 2.0
project, community members, neuroscientists, and neuroethics experts will co-develop and implement a
targeted, community-led and participant-centered deliverables to increase the participation of underrepresented
and minoritized (URM) groups in neuroimaging research. Using Community Engagement Studios, REACH for
BRAIN will facilitate bi-directional learning between community members and the research teams, providing local
value for the community and creating a foundation for neuroimaging researchers to implement the framework,
and engage and recruit motivated participants from URM communities. Initial implementation of the framework
will be by Connectome 2.0 researchers at the Martinos Center, to be followed by evaluation and then expansion
to additional neuroimaging research projects at MGH and Harvard.
 Aim 2: Given the fraught history of scientific racism and biological essentialism in brain science, Aim 1 efforts
to create appropriately diverse participation in neuroimaging must be accompanied by guidance on how to
reliably measure and report on “race,” “ethnicity,” “ancestry,” and related sociodemographic categories. In Aim
2 we will convene an interdisciplinary expert Working Group (WG) to create consensus ethical guidance and
proposed data elements for measuring and reporting demographics in more representative neuroscience
research, and we will create applied tools: a) a decision-aid for researchers for working with race, ethnicity, and
ancestry data in neuroimaging research; (b) an educational tool for community members; and c) a template for
neuroscience journal editors on publication guidelines for reporting race in neuroimaging studies. Impact and
Deliverables: We will widely disseminate the project’s tools and guidance via: a dedicated website, co-created
community events; national public events co-hosted by project partners; roundtables with journal editors;
conference presentations and academic publications; and formal submission to the NIH CDE Repository."
11067148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Present day multimodal monitoring for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is limited in its implementation as it
necessitates multiple invasive probes to measure intracranial pressure (ICP), intracranial EEG (icEEG),
intracranial temperature (icT), and brain tissue oxygen (PBTO2), the majority of which require their own
instrumentation and monitors. While there is increasing evidence to support multimodal monitoring in TBI and
other acute brain injuries, the present cumbersome systems make it nearly impossible to use outside of major
Level 1 trauma centers. The challenges include the need for expertise with both probe placement and data
interpretation as well as the integration of multiple electronic units from different vendors with diverse software
systems, each requiring training, IT and biomedical engineering support. Coupled with this is an increased risk
of bleeding and infection from the multiple entry points into brain parenchyma. Our objective is to develop a
single source brain monitoring solution for the management of severe TBI. We will integrate the modalities
indicated for severe TBI (ICP, icEEG, icT, PBTO2) in a brain implantable device called the NeuroProbe with a
target diameter which is equivalent to, or smaller than, individual current probes. We will develop a single
interface device called the NeuroLink to acquire the multi-modal intracranial data from the NeuroProbe as well
as scalp EEG and patient physiological data including systemic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), mean
arterial pressure (MAP) and blood oxygen (SpO2) and transmit these sensor signals to monitors as a time-
locked single digital data stream. We will develop a display unit called the NeuroMonitor to analyze and display
the acquired multimodal data in a synchronized real-time manner. We call the composite solution created by
the NeuroProbe, NeuroLink, and NeuroMonitor devices the NeuroProbe Solution. The technological
development of the NeuroProbe Solution dramatically expands the capabilities of the existing icEEG depth
electrodes developed at Yale University and multimodal probes currently on the market. The key innovations of
the NeuroProbe Solution are:
1. Integration of multiple physiologic sensors on a single intracranial probe (NeuroProbe).
2. Simplification of NeuroProbe to allow placement at bedside in a civilian or military facility.
3. Development of a multimodal interface device (NeuroLink) to store and relay time-locked digital data
 acquired from the NeuroProbe and extracranial sensors to the NeuroMonitor and other clinical monitors.
4. Development of an iPad sized monitor (NeuroMonitor) to analyze and display multimodal data.
5. Time-locked multi-stream data transfer which allows for real-time and post-hoc data review and analysis.
This innovative solution allows acquisition and integration of data from multiple physiological parameters
through a standard small tablet creating a simple single end-to-end solution from sensors to multimodal data
analysis and display in an otherwise fragmented and complex domain."

Today’s technologies allow profiling thousands of gene expression features for diseases and drugs at a very low
cost. This proposal entitled “Virtual Compound Screening Using Gene Expression” aims to develop novel data
science approaches to leverage emerging gene expression profiles to discover novel drugs. Previously, we
developed a scoring function called RGES to quantify the drug’s potency to reverse disease gene expression
based on the drug- and disease- expression profiles. We observed that RGES correlates with drug efficacy.
Using this idea, we and others identified drugs that could be repurposed to treat a number of diseases. However,
this approach currently does not support novel compound screening or lead optimization. To implement this
approach for large-scale screening of a big compound library, we first need to generate gene expression profiles
of the library compounds. However, because of the lack of large-scale gene expression profiles of new
compounds, virtual compound screening was impossible until recent efforts including ours demonstrated the
feasibility of predicting gene expression solely based on chemical structure. The objective of this project is thus
to develop novel machine learning methods to boost the performance of drug-gene expression prediction and
utilize the predicted profiles in practical drug discovery. To achieve the goals, we have assembled a team of
experts in computational drug discovery, machine learning, drug screening, and medicinal chemistry. First, we
will develop a robust, high-performance, and generalizable data-driven chemical structure embedding method
to enhance drug-induced gene expression prediction. With the predicted profiles, we will deploy RGES to score
compounds for given disease profiles. We will evaluate the performance in the screening of compounds for liver
cancer inhibitors, SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, and cell reprogramming regulators. Finally, we will apply it to lead
optimization. Our previous drug repurposing efforts identified and validated two candidates: niclosamide in liver
cancer and Mycophenolic acid in DIPG. However, the poor solubility of niclosamide and the poor penetration of
Mycophenolic acid in the brain hindered their further development. Accordingly, we will develop a deep
reinforcement learning framework to achieve the optimization of these two drugs. In parallel, domain experts will
propose new analogs. We will synthesize the analogs and compare the performance between domain experts
and the AI model. We expect this work will unleash the power of the emerging omics data in drug discovery."

11053151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to describe the molecular and cellular
mechanisms by which cells sense the presence of DNA damage and how they repair
chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs). Primarily using budding yeast as a model system, it
is possible to induce site-specific DSBs with a high degree of synchrony that is not generally
possible in mammalian cells, allowing “in vivo biochemistry” approaches to monitor intermediate
steps in DSB repair and DNA damage signaling. We also wish to apply our understanding of DNA
repair and recombination mechanisms to elucidate how the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia
burgdorferi, is able to “change its coat” by repeated gene conversion events.
The goals for the next five years of this project focus on understanding how homologous donor
sequences are found and used to repair a DSB and how mismatches are tolerated and repaired
during different steps of recombination. A second objective is to understand the basis of the 1000-
fold increase in mutations associated with DSB repair and how microhomologies are used in
repair-dependent template switching, creating complex chromosome rearrangements analogous
to events recently found in human cancers. We employ similar approaches to elucidating how
CRISPR/as9-mediated gene editing is accomplished using single-stranded DNA templates. A
third area of concern is to understand how the DNA damage checkpoint is regulated. We wish to
determine how the DNA damage response affects DSB repair and how the DNA damage
checkpoint is maintained and turned off. These studies will provide new insights and guidance in

Finally, we will continue our investigation of the mechanisms by which Borrelia initiates and
mediates gene conversion events between one expressed gene and a set of adjacent
pseudogenes."
11050836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Conventional vertical sleeve gastrectomy (cVSG) accounts for approximately 60% of all bariatric surgery
procedures. Its popularity is attributable to procedural simplicity, low complications, durable weight loss and
significant improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. However, numerous studies have found that the
cVSG is associated with new-onset gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and persistence or worsening of
pre-existing GERD. Chronic GERD is associated with increased risk for Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal
cancer. Hence, it is imperative to develop strategies to minimize GERD associated with the cVSG. The
pathophysiology cVSG-associated GERD is attributable to its surgical technique. First, the patients evaluated
for bariatric surgery are often found to have a defective antireflux barrier (ARB) and hiatal hernia, which
increase the risk of GERD. Second, the cVSG removes the entire gastric fundus resulting in 1) higher
intragastric pressure which is conducive to reflux, 2) disrupts gastric sling fibers leading to altered lower
esophageal sphincter function, and 3) disrupts the gastric cardia leading to loss of the gastroesophageal flap
valve (GEFV). The current project will test a modified VSG (mVSG) which will preserve the gastric sling fibers,
anchor the cardia to the distal esophagus, and recreate the GEFV. INNOVATE-VSG is a randomized single-
blind clinical trial with a 12-month follow-up. A total of 40 subjects with BMI 30-50 kg/m2 and GERD, meeting
eligibility for bariatric surgery, will be randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to the conventional VSG (cVSG) or the
mVSG at two academic sites. Aim 1. to determine whether mVSG, in comparison to cVSG, will be associated
with lower acid exposure time (AET, measured by the Bravo pH test) at 12 months. Aim 2. To elucidate the
mechanistic basis for Aim 1, we will perform following tests, before and at 12 months post-surgery: 1) High
resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) to determine the LES and intragastric pressure. We expect higher
LES pressure and lower intragastric pressure in patients with mVSG vs cVSG. 2) EndoFLIP testing to examine
changes in compliance of the LES. We expect lower LES compliance in patients with mVSG vs cVSG. 3)
Measure the length of the gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV) on the retroflex view during endoscopic exam.
We expect that GEFV will be present after mVSG vs absent after cVSG. Aim 3. Examine the impact of GERD
on quality of life (QoL) with two validated rating scales – GERD-HRQL and SF-36. We hypothesize mVSG
patients will have superior QoL compared to cVSG patients at 12 months. Additionally, we examine for the
presence of sling fibers in the resected stomach specimens. We expect to see sling fibers to be present in the
cVSG specimens but not in the mVSG specimens. We believe that the mVSG will lead to improvement of pre-
existing GERD along with improved quality of life for patients with obesity. The study findings have the
potential to transform the way VSG will be performed in future. This pilot study will generate more than
adequate data to help design a larger multi-site definitive clinical trial."
11053053,"Chronic, low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) is a hallmark of aging and a major risk factor for both
morbidity and mortality as well as being a major risk factor for a variety of age-related diseases, including
neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the link between inflammation, aging, and age-associated diseases, the
molecular mechanism(s) responsible for inflammaging is poorly understood. The objective of my current Merit
VA grant was to determine if necroptosis, a cell death pathway that induces inflammation, played a role in
inflammaging. We showed for the first time that necroptosis increased with age in various tissues including brain
and was associated with an increase in various markers of inflammation. Importantly, we found that globally
inhibiting/blocking necroptosis reduced markers of inflammation, which supported our original hypothesis.
Interestingly, we found that the age-related increase in markers of necroptosis in the brain occurred primarily in
neurons in the hippocampus and cortex even though there is little, if any loss of neurons. Thus, the activation of
necroptosis in neurons does not appear to result in neuronal death. The overall objective of the current proposal
is to determine the mechanism(s) by which neuronal activation of necroptosis can impact the aging brain without
leading to neuronal death. We hypothesize that the activation of necroptosis in neurons leads to neuronal
dysfunction and the release of necroptotic extracellular vesicles, which induce neuroinflammation when
phagocytosed by microglia and/or astrocytes. We will test this hypothesis using mouse models in which
necroptosis activation is blocked or induced specifically in neurons, e.g., Ripk3fl/fl and Mlklfl/fl mice crossed to
transgenic Slick-H Cre transgenic mice to produce Ripk3NeuKO or MlklNeuKO mice in which necroptosis is blocked
and crossing Ripk3- or Mlkl-knockin mice to SLICK-H Cre-transgenic mice to produce Ripk3NeuOE or MlklNeuOE
mice, which overexpress RIPK3 or MLKL specifically in neurons. Using old (24- to 26-months) Ripk3NeuKO,
MlklNeuKO, Ripk3NeuOE, and MlklNeuOE mice compared to adult (6-months) and old wild type (WT) mice, we will
conduct the first experiments on the impact of necroptosis activation in a specific cell type (in this case neurons)
on inflammation and the function of a cell in the absence of cell death.
Aim 1. To determine the role of neuronal necroptosis activation in neuroinflammation. The impact of
reducing or inducing the activation of necroptosis in neurons on neuroinflammation in old mice will be assessed
by measuring proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and markers of neuroinflammation in various regions of
the brain. We predict that altering necroptosis specifically in neurons will in turn impact neuroinflammation.
Aim 2. To determine the mechanism of how neuronal necroptosis activation leads to
neuroinflammation. First, we will determine if blocking or inducing necroptosis activates specific populations of
microglia or astrocytes in the hippocampus using single-cell transcriptomics. Second, we will determine if altering
necroptosis activation in neurons leads to alterations in the ESCART-III pathway, which prevents the rupture of
the cell membrane by necroptosis. In addition, the levels of necroptotic EVs (containing MLKL and MLKL
oligomers) in the hippocampus will be measured in our mouse models. Third, we will determine if neuronal cell
cultures, in which necroptosis activation is induced, produce necroptotic EVs that are phagocytosed by cultures
of microglia, leading to the activation of microglia and the generation of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines.
Aim 3. To determine the role of neuronal necroptosis activation on neuronal function and cognition. The
effect of reducing or inducing neuronal necroptosis activation on neuronal function will be measured as calcium
dynamics and long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices and the transcriptome of hippocampal neurons.
Cognition (e.g., Morris water maze, Phenotyper, fear conditioning, novel object recognition) will be measured in
old Ripk3NeuKO, MlklNeuKO, Ripk3NeuOE, and MlklNeuOE mice and compared to adult and old WT mice."
11056370,"The principal goal of this new grant cycle is to uncover the origin and nature of uniqueness of
the cerebral cortex of the human, and non-human primates (NHP), particularly the association
areas such as the prefrontal cortex, that underlie the highest level of our cognitive capacities
and are thought to be undermined in neuropsychiatric disorders including drug abuse. Although
basic principles of cortical development in all mammals are similar, there are important
quantitative and qualitative evolutionary innovations that were introduced in primates since their
split from the rodent lineage about 60 million years ago. Thus, our strategy will be to study in
parallel the developmental events in the NHP (macaque) and human skin-cell-derived iPSC
cortex-mimicking cultures by using the most advanced molecular and cell biological methods
available, including comparative high-resolution single-cell mRNA sequencing, advanced
confocal and light-sheet imaging, and in utero and ex utero functional manipulation of neural
stem cells. We will complete and further augment our ongoing high-resolution single-cell mRNA
sequencing and gain insight through bioinformatic gene network analysis in three species:
macaque, human, and mouse. We will first investigate the genetic determinants of primate
specific stem cell subtypes, using gene clustering analysis at the transcriptome level, and
determine how this impacts the cortical expansion process through functional studies (Aim #1).
As a next step, we will examine genes and regulatory elements involved in emergence of areal
and laminar specific distinction in monkey embryonic cortex and human iPSC 3D cortex
mimicking cultures, generated from skin fibroblasts, to identify unique signatures of human and
nonhuman primate-specific gene expression in evolutionarily new cortical areas such as
prefrontal cortex (Aim #2). Finally, we will examine how cortical neuropil and the growth and
patterning of white matter contribute to cortical area differences and drive primate-specific
cortical gyrification (Aim #3). Although the proposed research is time-consuming, logistically
difficult and costly, it is essential if we are to understand the biological basis of our humanity and
the pathogenesis of some high order cognitive disorders, including drug abuse. We have
established primate precisely timed breeding facilities at Yale, as well as mastered and modified
essential methodology and already have obtained a substantial amount of high impact
information which alone, or in combination, can give insight into elusive neuropsychiatric
disorders and neuronal susceptibility to prenatal exposure to drugs of therapy and abuse."
11056371,"Summary
Cells carrying the same DNA sequence can exhibit heterogeneous gene expression, leading to phenotypic and
functional diversity in both healthy and diseased states. This heterogeneity fundamentally arises at the nucleus
level often from different spatio-temporal patterns of genomic organization, which could differentially influence
the frequency and strength of the physical interactions among genetic elements related to gene expression.
Disruptions in these interaction patterns are often associated with disease, and accordingly, there is a growing
interest in advancing tools for identifying abnormal spatial patterns and contact profiles of the genome. DNA
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is intrinsically a single-cell assay and suitable for probing cell-to-cell
variation as well as targeted detection of chromosomal interactions. However, the use of DNA FISH for high-
throughput and high-resolution proximity detection is presently limited due to the lack of strategies enabling
multiplexing and high-specific labeling with low background signal. This project will devise two separate FISH
approaches that address the multiplexing and labeling challenges of DNA FISH by making novel use of our lab's
recently developed Signal Amplification By Exchange Reaction (SABER) method (Nature Methods, 2019), which
can simultaneously increase imaging throughput and multiplexing levels. Specifically, the first aim will introduce
a variant of the SABER method that only allows signal amplification upon physical contact between a pair of
FISH probes. This method will be optimized for DNA FISH and its wide versatility will be demonstrated in the
second aim, in the two separate applications: 1) for high-specific and low-background labeling of short DNA
targets and 2) a correction-free (i.e. no channel alignment) one-step colocalization assay for detection of distal
DNA sequences in close 3D proximity. The outstanding research environment of the Wyss Institute for
Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University will offer numerous resources critical for the successful
completion of the proposed goals and ensure the maximum impact of the research given the institute's core
focus is on novel technology development and translation. The sponsor of the project, Dr. Peng Yin, and his
team who have expertise in developing DNA-based molecular devises, imaging, and experience with
chromosomal studies will provide detailed technical support and personalized mentorship. The successful
completion of the aims will thus bring new methodologies to the growing scientific community at the interface
between chromosome conformation capture (3C) and FISH for cross-validation of contact profiles and will further
expand the utility of FISH in potential diagnostic applications."
11056373,"Project Summary/Abstract
Bone marrow aspirates are critical to the diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of hematologic conditions and
cancers (e.g., leukemia, aplastic anemia, sickle cell disease, and metastasis of solid tumors), but 8-50% of
aspirations are unsuccessful due to operator technique, hemodilution, or underlying pathology. Because this
process is manual and error-prone, there is an opportunity to improve patient outcomes by providing real-time
and automated feedback on the sample quality. Cellia Science will enable improved quality and reliability of
bone marrow aspiration procedures by developing a point-of-care screening instrument. Our approach is
based on a recently developed label-free, deep-ultraviolet (UV) technique for cell imaging and analysis.
Preliminary data has shown that the spicules present in a bone marrow aspirate are easily identifiable by their
characteristic deep blue hue in the unstained pseudocolorized UV image—a result of strong light attenuation at
255nm by bone spicules. The resulting deep-UV images can be generated in under 3 minutes, making the
technique suitable for real-time use during aspiration procedures, and are nearly identical to the Giemsa-
stained slides, which take over 45 min to process. Label-free deep-UV imaging can be combined with machine
learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, which will enable automated quality assessment of
aspirate smears without a pathology technician. We will leverage this technology to develop a bone marrow
aspirate quality screening device for use during aspiration procedures. Towards this goal, we propose quantify
sensitivity and specificity of spicule detection by deep-UV microscopy and evaluate concordance of deep-UV
aspirate assessment with visual assessment by trained technician, with Giemsa-stained samples serving as
the ground truth. We will also develop prototype instrument for automated spicule adequacy assessment to
enable adoption of this technique without a specially trained pathology technician. To automate the adequacy
assessment, we will use machine learning techniques for feature extraction and classification, detect the
presence of one or more spicules in the sample. Successful implementation of this device is expected to
increase the fraction of successful procedures, which will drastically improve the quality of care for the patient.
Cellia is applying for TABA funding to support the development of a strategic plan for improving the protection
of our adequacy assessment technology and the drafting of a filing consistent with the strategic plan."
11056642,"Oral cancer remains a life-threatening disease with 11,580 deaths in the US each year. Surgery provides the best chance of survival and is the preferred treatment option for oral cancer patients.  Unfortunately, 60% of oral cancer patients are unable to undergo surgical treatment as their tumors are deemed unresectable (unable to be removed with surgery) due to involvement with surrounding fragile organs that would risk their quality of life if impacted by surgery. This patient group faces five-year survivals less than 10% as alternatives like systemic chemotherapy and radiation treatment suffer from dose-limiting toxicities and low response rates. Focal Medical (FM) has identified a solution of a novel medical drug delivery device that can drive chemotherapy directly into target tumors using a method called iontophoresis. This method of drug delivery can deliver large quantities of chemotherapy directly to the tumor to promote tumor shrinkage and make oral cancer patients eligible for surgical treatments. This work proposes the development of an oral tumor device through in vitro and in vivo systematic testing that will establish the feasibility and safety of our solution. Success of this work has the potential to transform treatment of oral cancer patients with unresectable tumors and increase their survival probability by four times."
11054894,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most (60-90%) adolescents in treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) also have a co-occurring psychiatric
disorder (COD) other than substance use, and adolescents with AUD+CODs have worse treatment outcomes
compared to those with only AUD. Among adolescents seeking treatment for AUD+CODs, over 80% also use
cannabis. The adult AUD treatment literature demonstrates worse alcohol-related treatment outcomes for
individuals who used cannabis during AUD treatment, but similar information is missing regarding how
cannabis use might influence AUD+COD treatment processes. Consistent with NIAAA’s strategic plan to
improve treatment for AUD+CODs, this K23 proposal aims to fill a critical gap in understanding how cannabis
use affects AUD+COD treatment outcomes among adolescents in community-based treatment. Understanding
whether, for whom, in what contexts, and how cannabis use relates to treatment processes and AUD+COD
outcomes in real-world community-based treatment will inform viable and meaningful cannabis-related
intervention targets for adolescent AUD+COD treatment. This K23 will use mixed methods to inform how
cannabis use relates to AUD+COD treatment processes and outcomes. Participants will be recruited from
community-based intensive outpatient programs for AUD+CODs who also use cannabis. Aim 1a will use
qualitative interviews (N=25) to explore adolescents’ perspectives on their cannabis use in the context of
AUD+COD treatment. Aim 1b will use an open pilot ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study (N=5) to
solicit feedback and refine the Aim 2 protocol. Aim 2 will use 21 days of EMA during treatment plus longitudinal
follow-up surveys at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-months post-intensive outpatient treatment (N=90) to understand the
dynamics of how AUD+COD processes unfold when adolescents are using cannabis in their natural
environments. Results will shed light on how cannabis use affects AUD+COD treatment among adolescents
with AUD+CODs and identify productive treatment targets that prioritize adolescents’ lived experiences and
are relevant in community-based care. Results will also inform models of addressing polysubstance use in
treatment more broadly, which is prevalent in community-based care but largely neglected in clinical trials. This
K23 leverages the candidate’s expertise using EMA and multilevel modeling to study alcohol-cannabis co-use
while providing needed training in qualitative and mixed methods research, developmentally informed research
on adolescents in the context of community-based treatment, advanced structural equation modeling, and
professional development, to launch a successful NIAAA-funded clinical research career advancing adolescent
addiction science and community-based treatment. A mentorship team with unique and complementary areas
of expertise are committed to the candidate’s research and training."

This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an
independent investigator who specializes in examining the techniques food companies use to market unhealthy
products to Black communities, with a specific focus on advanced digital technologies, such as virtual reality (VR). Food
marketing has been unequivocally linked to poor diet and risk of excessive weight gain in young people. Food
companies disproportionately target Black consumers with more advertisements (“ads”) and the least healthy ads,
contributing to nutritional disparities and nutrition-related diseases. To expand their reach, food companies have
developed VR marketing experiences that are engaging, highly sophisticated, and may more powerfully elicit biological
signals precipitating a motivation to consume foods. Although most food marketing studies focus on children and
adolescents due to their inability to recognize persuasive intent, Black young adults may be especially vulnerable to the
effects of food marketing exposure due to being highly targeted, shifts during this developmental period, and
food/nutritional insecurity. No study has examined the effect of VR food marketing exposure on biological signal
activation and purchase intention among Black young adults, or the interactions with food/nutritional insecurity. To
address these gaps, I have developed the following specific aims/hypotheses. Aim 1 will be to determine the extent to
which VR food marketing influences purchase intention and whether effects are more pronounced in Black young adults.
I hypothesize that exposure to VR food marketing will influence purchase intention versus the VR non-food control, and
Black (versus white young adults) exposed to VR food marketing will demonstrate higher purchase intention. Aim 2 will
be to understand the influence of biological signal activation on the relationship between VR food marketing and
purchase intention. I hypothesize that larger electrodermal amplitude and higher salivary reactivity will lead to stronger
purchase intention in those randomized to VR food marketing versus the control and that the effects will be more
pronounced among those with higher weight. Aim 3 will be to explore the interactions among race/ethnicity,
food/nutritional insecurity, biological signal activation, and purchase intention among Black young adults exposed to VR
food marketing. I hypothesize that those reporting low/very low food security will demonstrate stronger electrodermal
amplitude and higher salivary reactivity when exposed to the VR food marketing condition versus all others. I will develop
a community-based young adult advisory board to assist with interpretation of the results. It will be necessary to obtain
mentorship and training in VR, integrating biological measurements into an experimental paradigm, and applied
statistical analyses for biological outcomes to complete this project and develop the critical research competencies to
elucidate how advanced digital food marketing strategies influence nutritional disparities and nutrition-related disease
risk among Black young adults. Findings can inform novel behavioral interventions and regulatory efforts, such as the
Federal Trade Commission’s initiative to reduce stealth digital food marketing targeting vulnerable groups."

SUMMARY – OVERALL COMPONENT
The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by
the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and
nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to
train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research,
to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The
bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an
unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically,
the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including
American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican-
Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and
institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific
focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on
cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in
support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of
disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two
foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate
cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino
investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity
research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings
in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in
biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and
evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be
facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics,
Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the
Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU
have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC
provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino
population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos.

Implications of the Emerging Re-identifiability Risks from Wrist-worn Activity Data.

Abstract/Project Summary:
Raw motion data obtained from wrist-worn sensors (e.g., activity trackers, smartwatches) consists of data that,
to date, have been considered de-identified for the purposes of data sharing, informed consent, and ethical
considerations of human subjects research. Emerging research indicates that such data may re-identify a
specific person with only hours to a day’s worth of collected data. With the growing impetus for more open data
sharing of de-identified study data, both as a matter of open science policy from publicly funded research and
as a matter of necessity to advance and refine artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) approaches, this
discovery of re-identifiability of wrist-worn motion data has considerable implications on the privacy,
confidentiality, rights, and welfare of human research participants who participate in the ever-growing numbers
of research studies involving these wearable devices. This project will develop and disseminate, at a much faster
capacity than via the dissemination of research as it is traditionally published, the risk characterizations and
mitigation strategies among the scientific community regarding the bioethics risks embedded in these types of
data. The educational and dissemination strategies from this project will help ensure that research of this type
can continue while being proactive to prevent major violations of trust and confidentiality from the public and
among the research community, should these re-identification risks begin to bear real harm."

Malformations of brain development are a common cause of neurological disorders in children. The most
common of these neurodevelopmental disorders is the large group of malformations of cortical development
(MCD) characterized by disruption of the structure of the cerebral cortex (e.g., enhanced cell size, altered
lamination). Somatic mutations have been identified in regulatory genes of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR (mTOR)
pathway in the brain tissue of patients with these MCD collectively termed ‘mTORopathies.’ Focal cortical
dysplasia is a particularly challenging mTORopathy due to the presence of highly epileptogenic lesions within
the cortex that are often resistant to medication and/or difficult to resect. The most common genetic variants
causing FCD are found in genes that encode protein subunits forming the GATOR1 complex: DEPDC5, NPRL2,
and NPRL3- a negative regulator of mTOR signaling. Many studies have linked variants in DEPDC5 and NPRL3
to mTOR pathway hyperactivation, MCD, and seizures, but there few studies functionally validating or modeling
variants in NPRL2 and, currently, mTOR inhibitors are not used to treat epilepsy in these patients. This project
seeks to investigate the effects of Nprl2 loss in vitro and in vivo and to identify the mTOR-dependent
transcriptomic changes that occur as a result of Nprl2 KO. The results of this proposal stand to provide a deep
functional and transcriptomic understanding of NPRL2 variant associated phenotypes, provide pre-clinical
support for the use of mTOR inhibitors in effected individuals, and identify novel therapeutic targets downstream
of mTOR that may provide precision therapy options in the future."
11055793,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The recent resurgence in cocaine use in the U.S. is a significant public health concern and there is an
urgent need to address the long-standing absence of effective treatments for cocaine-use disorder (CUD).
Highly innovative research into unexplored brain mechanisms of addiction may provide insights into alternative
therapeutic solutions. The proposed research program will investigate one such brain system, the type-1
muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1), in individuals with CUD following a phased research approach
consistent with the scope of the NIDA Phased Innovation Award (PAR-19-282).
 The M1 receptor is the most abundant receptor in the brain for acetylcholine, a principal modulatory
neurotransmitter system, and is linked to neural plasticity. M1 receptors are highly expressed throughout the
brain and are particularly concentrated in the striatum and hippocampus, key hubs of addiction-related
functioning. Preclinical evidence is consistent in demonstrating that activation of M1 receptors reduces, and M1
inhibition enhances, the rewarding effects of cocaine. Similarly, research is consistent in demonstrating that the
number of M1 receptors is lower in preclinical models of regular cocaine use. Given these implications of M1
receptor functioning in CUD, and close neurobiological links to regulating dopamine, another critical
neurotransmitter in addictions, the potential for M1-targeting pharmacotherapies to benefit individuals with
CUD motivates exploration into this novel area of addiction neurobiology.
 The recent development of the M1-selective agonist radiotracer [11C]-LSN3172176 allows, for the first
time, in vivo assessment of M1 receptor availability in humans. Non-treatment-seeking individuals with a
current CUD, and matched healthy comparison participants will complete [11C]-LSN3172176 PET imaging and
exploratory MRI and neurocognitive testing using a phased research design. This approach provides an
opportunity for an interim assessment of the preliminary data to determine the merits of further data collection
and possible refinement of procedures to optimize the benefit of this highly exploratory research. Greater
knowledge of the M1 receptor holds potential to inform the development of effective interventions for CUD,
particularly in the developing area of cognitive enhancement and pharmacologically augmented behavioral
therapy."

This phase II SBIR proposal is aimed at developing a highly accurate functional in vitro diagnostic
(IVD) assay for the detection of pathogenic antibodies in Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), an
adverse reaction to heparin treatment. This assay is based on recent findings that Platelet Factor 4
(PF4)-treated platelets can be used for the sensitive and specific detection of clinically-significant HIT
antibodies. HIT kills more than 5 patients every day in the US and is frequently suspected in heparin-treated
hospitalized patients who may have a number of potential causes for thrombocytopenia. To assist with
diagnosis and management, physicians rely on two families of HIT assays. The first, the PF4/Polyanion ELISA-
based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays are sensitive but are highly non-specific such that the positive predictive
value of these assays is poor at only 30-50%. The second, more accurate platelet activation-based (functional)
assays such as the Serotonin release assay (SRA) are technically complex and are performed only at a few
reference laboratories which can lead to a long turnaround times. As a result, frontline ELISAs are used to
manage most HIT-suspected patients and many patients with false-positive ELISAs are inappropriately treated
with alternative anticoagulants which are expensive and have a significantly worse bleeding profile. Retham’s
goal is to revolutionize HIT diagnosis by replacing both the inaccurate ELISA and technically complex SRA
with HITDx, a simple yet accurate functional IVD that can be performed in the hospital laboratory. HITDx is
based on groundbreaking research that suggests that pathogenic platelet-activating HIT antibodies can bind
and activate PF4-treated platelets in a heparin-independent manner. Clinical studies including a 409-patient,
prospective, multicenter, blinded study demonstrate that this technology can be leveraged to provide accurate
HIT diagnosis. During phase I, Retham Technologies demonstrated that PF4 treated, long term (12-months)
stabilized platelets can be coupled to an ELISA-based endpoint for detection of a novel analyte, demonstrating
that this technology can be adapted to an IVD assay. The foundational patents covering this technology have
issued, and multiple additional patents are pending in various jurisdictions. In this SBIR Phase II proposal,
Retham will develop, verify and assess the performance of a self-contained HIT IVD prototype using PF4-
treated long-term stored platelets. The utility of HITDx for detection of antibodies that cause vaccine-induced
thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a newly recognized complication of COVID-19 vaccines will be assessed in
future studies. The project will be led by Curtis Jones who is inventor of this technology and spearheaded the
development of novel methods to stabilize platelets. He will be supported by Dr. Padmanabhan, a leading HIT
expert, QA/RA and biostatistics consultants, and expert Retham advisory board members. It is expected that
this patient-impacting product will revolutionize HIT diagnosis by decentralizing functional testing and providing
rapid, accurate results that will facilitate early and appropriate patient management."

The mammalian central nervous system contains unique projections from the cerebral cortex thought to underpin complex motor and cognitive skills. These projections include the corticospinal tract. involved in motor function, and the corpus callosum, involved in executive function. The cerebral cortical neurons that give rise to the corticospinal tract and corpus callosum are, respectively, corticospinal motor neurons and callosal projection neurons. These neurons develop from the same progenitor pool at the same time in development, but they acquire strikingly different projections to serve strikingly different behaviors. The mechanisms whereby corticospinal and callosal projection neurons develop represents a fundamental open question in basic neuroscience: how do the unique projections underlying complex mammalian behaviors arise? While it is known that transcription factors play a critical role in the fate of corticospinal, callosal, and other cortical projection neurons, the contribution of other gene regulatory mechanisms is poorly understood. We posit that a genomic cluster of selectively expressed microRNAs are epigenetically co-regulated in corticospinal motor neurons (Aim 1 ), where they in turn co-regulate axon guidance pathways (Aim 2) to favor corticospinal over callosal projection neuron fate (Aim 3). We will employ deep sequencing and in vivo functional perturbation studies to test our hypothesis. This microRNA-mediated specification of fate represents a novel mechanism of cortical projection neuron development, with implications not only for fundamental mechanisms of cortical development, but also for understanding the evolution of the complex connectivity of the mammalian central nervous system."

notification and foci investigation. We will support the Kenyan Ministry of Health (MoH) with their goal to digitise
the data collected on their paper-based health registers using software that makes them scannable (1.1.5). This will
include registers that capture case-burden data used in out-patient departments (1.1.6) and by community health
workers as part of integrated community case management (ICCM) (1.1.7), and antenatal clinic registers that
capture malaria infection prevalence during first antenatal clinic visits. This is a novel method to track the
asymptomatic parasite reservoir in populations (1.1.8). Combined, this allows, for the first time, sustainable, daily,
near real-time surveillance to track progress towards malaria transmission reduction targets. We will also conduct
continuous malaria indicator household surveys (cMIS) to track malaria prevalence and intervention coverage (1.1.9)
and entomological monitoring (1.2), both using adaptive sampling frameworks that can respond to challenges
related to rapid changes in malaria transmission. As part of the second objective, we will implement population-wide
interventions targeting malaria transmission, starting in 2021/22. The optimal combination of novel or improved
interventions will be developed in close collaboration with CDC in 2020/21. This is likely to include enhanced case-
management using digitally supported quality improvement approaches of ICCM, enhanced vector control with
larval source management and insecticide-treated piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, and mass drug administration with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and ivermectin targeting the asymptomatic parasite reservoir (2.1). The third
objective involves assessing the safety effectiveness of currently deployed antimalarials for the prevention (3.2.1)
and treatment (3.2 and 3.3) of malaria in the context of increasing antimalarial drug resistance. We will liaise with
CDC’s laboratories in Atlanta for the molecular monitoring of drug resistance. The fourth objective aims to maximise
the public health impact by supporting the creation of a knowledge centre at the KEMRI’s CGHR for evidence
synthesis and information exchange to enhance the translation of global malaria control policies (4). Objective 5
involves the strengthening of research capacity of the partners in Kenya by the provision of internships (5.1) and
MSc, PhD and post-doctoral studentships and research leadership mentoring (5.1)."
11078004,"Abstract
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver-related mortality/morbidity, and there is no
FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD. Advanced ALD conditions, including severe alcohol-associated
hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcohol-associated cirrhosis (deAC), have especially poor outcomes.
Indeed, the 90-day mortality for sAH is ~30%. Return to drinking impacts quality of life and mortality in these
patients. There are limited drug therapies or well-studied behavior therapies in this patient population. An optimal
approach would be the integration of AUD and ASLD care givers and therapies, but there are no guidelines for
this approach. Our proposed AUD/ALD team approach seeks to overcome the perceived stigma of alcohol
misuse which can adversely affect treatment seeking, quality of care and patient outcomes. The AlcHepNet study
was stopped at the interim analysis because of the unexpected 90% 90-day survival in sAH patients treated with
prednisone using the Lille stopping rule. These dramatic results need to be confirmed, and novel therapies such
as IL-22 need to be studied in sAH. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) improved MELD score
at 30 days and reduced drinking at 6 months in patients with moderate AH (e.g., novel AUD/ALD therapy).
Acamprosate appears to be the safest FDA-approved therapy for AUD in patients with ALD, but safety and
efficacy in severe ALD need to be evaluated. Take Control is a novel computer-based behavioral platform derived
from the NIAAA’s Rethinking Drinking which we propose to evaluate in severe ALD. Based on preliminary data
and knowledge gaps, our overall hypothesis is that an integrated management of ALD and AUD will
improve clinical outcomes in patients with sAH and decompensated ALD. We will utilize the following AIMS:
Aim 1. Perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial of treatment for steroid-eligible patients with
severe AH. A masked study comparing daily prednisone for 28 days (with the 7-day Lille score-based stop rule)
vs. IL-22 fusion protein (F-652). Early intervention for AUD will include behavioral therapy platform (Take Control)
in all subjects and either acamprosate or placebo before discharge from the hospital. The primary endpoint of
the trial will be a composite measure of mortality, liver, and alcohol use related outcomes. Aim 2. Evaluate
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis. In patients with
decompensated cirrhosis due to ALD, in whom corticosteroids are not effective, a randomized, placebo-
controlled trial of LGG in combination with Take Control and locally accepted SOC for 6 months will be performed.
A composite measure (as in AIM 1) at 6 months will be the primary end point for this AIM also. AIM 3. Build a
platform for biosamples, data repositories, and patient registries to support site-specific and network-
wide ancillary studies. In summary, these proposed studies will leverage the existing resources of the
AlcHepNet to evaluate the clinical impact of integrated ALD/AUD treatment in a diverse cohort of typically
underserved patients."
11079686,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 DNA replication is a highly conserved process essential for all life. Since eukaryotic genomes are very
large, they are replicated in parallel from thousands of replication origins. Proper regulation of replication
initiation is essential for maintaining genome stability. Oncogene activation dysregulates replication initiation
and enables rapid cell proliferation in cancer. Key regulators of replication initiation are over-expressed in
cancer, and mutations in these proteins cause rare genetic disorders.
 Yet, the molecular mechanisms that underlie replication initiation remain poorly understood, especially
in multicellular organisms, for two main reasons: (1) replication initiation involves transient protein-protein and
protein-DNA interactions that are very challenging to study using existing biochemical, genetic, and structural
methods; and (2) the most comprehensive studies of replication initiation have been done in yeast, however key
regulators of replication initiation are poorly conserved between yeast and metazoans. Notably, some human
replication factors are 2-3x larger than their yeast counterparts and containing novel domains with unknown
functions.
 My laboratory recently developed a single-molecule imaging platform to visualize replication initiation
in real time. We will use this powerful approach to (i) provide a quantitative description of replication initiation;
(ii) understand how this process changed from yeast to humans; (iii) delineate the role of key replication proteins
and their domains that are unique to metazoans; and (iv) understand why mutations in some replication
initiation factors cause disease. Our work will also provide valuable mechanistic insights into how cancer cells
sustain rapid proliferation by over-activating replication initiation and inform how replication initiation factors
may be used as biomarkers or targets for novel therapies."
11053187,"Research Summary Statement
Immune cells interpret chemical cues in their environment and make decisions that control their fate. For
example, human neutrophils often respond to signals by polarizing and migrating toward the chemical source.
Critical for these cellular functions is the dynamic interplay between cell surface receptors, small GTPases, and
the enzymes that synthesize phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids. This study aims to decipher the
mechanisms the control communication between these different classes of signaling molecules at the plasma
membrane. Using human neutrophils, we find that Cdc42 GTPase and a lipid phosphatase denoted SHIP1
trigger a molecular signal that propagates across the plasma membrane in the form of a traveling wave. This
behavior, coined excitability, involves repetitive cycles of protein recruitment ON and OFF the membrane. The
goal of this study is to determine how SHIP1 regulates the excitable signaling network by integrating signals
derived from lipids and membrane tethered proteins. Using a variety of in vitro biochemistry techniques, including
supported membrane technology and single molecule imaging, we will determine how lipid composition controls
SHIP1 membrane association and phosphatase activity (Aim 1). Using factors that regulate the excitable
signaling network in cells, we will reconstitute mechanisms that control SHIP1 membrane recruitment, release
of autoinhibition, and activation (Aim 2). In parallel, we will use CRISPR based genome editing, optogenetics,
and quantitative live cell imaging of fluorescent biosensors to elucidate how communication between PIP lipids
and small GTPase is regulated by SHIP1. Using these tools we will determine the role SHIP1 serves as signaling
network scaffold versus a lipid phosphatase (Aim 3). Overall, this study will unify membrane biophysics and cell
biology to explain how PIP lipids, small GTPases, and SHIP1 synergistically control the excitable signaling
network and cell migration in neutrophils. By unraveling how white blood cells sense, interpret, and respond to
pathogenic signals we will fill a gap in knowledge concerning how these signaling molecules coordinate cellular
movement with the underlying excitable network. This discovery could open doors for researchers to develop
new therapeutics that can be used to modulate immune cell functions in ways that combat infection,
inflammation, and cancer."
11055131,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11056282,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence-
based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are
not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely
interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the
point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by
an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in
identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data
from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of
adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for
incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated
continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large
number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous
updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict
adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict
medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location-
based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2)
to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on
patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance
is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a
second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in
several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to
incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with
publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the
most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by
evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will
ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating
the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used
for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at
which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately,
improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF."
11056343,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The goal of this proposal is to identify early life predictors of symptoms of ADHD and associated behavioral and
emotional problems. To do so children are followed from before birth to 4.5 years of age—on the cusp of school entry and
well into the preschool period. ADHD and related problems with behavioral and emotional dysregulation are often not
clinically identified until school age. By that point they are difficult to reverse. This proposal answers calls in the literature
for earlier identification of risk and for discovery of early life mechanisms that can be targets for low-risk yet effective
early life intervention to prevent the full onset of these problems. To do so we expand the study of an existing maternal-
infant cohort by adding measures, time points, and an older outcome. We extend the cohort from the toddler years into the
preschool period when psychopathology has begun to take shape and be able to be relatively reliably characterized. Key
mechanisms to be examined are (a) biological signals in early life, focused on maternal inflammation and serotonergic
metabolites during pregnancy and the trajectory of change in those signals in the first three years of life; (b) brain
development as indexed by EEG measures from birth to age 3 years (lower cost and more readily clinically applicable
than MRI at this stage); and (c) behavioral dynamics in early caregiving, about which little is known regarding ADHD
risk in the first 24 months of life. The inflammation hypothesis builds on striking preliminary data uncovered by the PI's
in their prior work. The EEG metrics likewise are supported by preliminary evidence. The behavioral data also have
strong preliminary data and build on multiple theorists' proposals about the role of early emotional regulation in
subsequent risk for dysregulatory psychopathology and ADHD. Both baseline (intercept) and change (trajectory)
measures will be examined to help evaluate when in development a particular domain or level of analysis is most
informative to subsequent outcome. Each of these hypotheses is examined in stand-alone fashion, and then with those
findings in hand, an integrative developmental model will be tested. If successful the study will open new directions for
low-risk yet potentially effective early intervention by identifying specific, measurable, and reversible risk factors or
mechanisms as candidates for clinical trial follow up."
11074200,"SUMMARY
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease in premature infants, caused by mechanical
ventilation and hyperoxia amongst other factors. Thirty percent of infants with moderate to severe BPD develop
pulmonary hypertension (PH), characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling. There are no curative therapies
for this disease. Current management is limited to relieving symptoms using pulmonary vasodilators, and
minimizing further lung vascular and alveolar insults. My long-term goal is to develop novel targeted therapies
to prevent and/or treat BPD associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH). Pulmonary vascular remodeling is
characterized by increased smooth muscle cell-specific markers. This results from proliferation and migration of
vascular smooth muscle cells, or transdifferentiation from endothelial cells (ECs) to smooth muscle cells (i.e.,
endothelial-mesenchymal transition, EndoMT). We and others have shown that hyperoxia to newborn mice and
mechanical ventilation in preterm lambs cause pulmonary vascular remodeling resulting in PH. This is associated
with increased EndoMT, as shown in our recent publication and in preliminary data. We preliminarily show that
EndoMT is also observed in the lung of premature infants requiring mechanical ventilation, suggesting that this
may be causative in pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. In mice, we have reported that neonatal hyperoxia
causes a persistent reduction of endothelial carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme of
the carnitine shuttle system responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation
during fatty acid oxidation. Our preliminary data show that lung Cpt1a gene expression is also reduced in
mechanically ventilated preterm lambs and premature human infants. Additionally, endothelial deletion of Cpt1a
increased EndoMT and pulmonary vascular remodeling in neonatal mice after exposure to hyperoxia.
Furthermore, pharmacological upregulation of Cpt1a attenuated hyperoxia-induced EndoMT in cultured lung
ECs. Whether neonatal hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation reduce endothelial Cpt1a, leading to PH is yet to
be determined. The central hypothesis is that neonatal hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation cause EndoMT by
downregulating endothelial Cpt1a, thereby resulting in pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH. We will test this
hypothesis in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms by which Cpt1a regulates
hyperoxia-induced EndoMT. In Aim 2, we will define the role of endothelial Cpt1a in neonatal hyperoxia-induced
PH and EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will evaluate endothelial Cpt1a and EndoMT as therapeutic targets for BPD-PH
using both lamb and mouse models. The combination of clinically relevant lamb and mouse models with our
newly generated EC-specific Cpt1a KO mice and newly developed nanoparticle delivery system provides an
innovative approach to uncover the mechanisms by which Cpt1a reduction mediates EndoMT and their
significant roles in BPD-PH. This contribution is significant because it is likely to result in new therapies
specifically targeting endothelial Cpt1a or EndoMT in neonates to prevent or cure BPD-PH."
11040584,"This proposal aims to advance drug repurposing for rare cancers by utilizing cutting-edge computational approaches. The long-term objectives are to discover effective treatments for rare cancers with known drug targets and accelerate their transition into clinical practice. The proposed research is highly health-related as it addresses the urgent need for novel treatments for rare cancers, which pose a significant burden on affected individuals and their families.
The company will construct a large-scale, high-quality biomedical knowledge graph (KG) using state-of-the-art natural language processing technologies to extract information from PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles.

11036430,"The five year survival of children with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma (NBL), often with MYCN amplified tumors, is only about 10%, and the outcome for this subset of patients has shown no improvement over the last 30 years, thus new treatment approaches are urgently needed. We propose to exploit a newly discovered function of the tumor suppressor PP2A in promoting transcriptional pausing of RNA polymerase II as a novel anti-cancer mechanism which underlies transcriptional addiction, an acquired reliance on the continuous activity of an oncogenic transcription program in MYCN amplified NBL.  This is an, as yet, unexploited therapeutic vulnerability of MYCN amplified NBL, and it is likely to be synergistic with the known PP2A-B56 mediated destabilization of N-Myc.  The lead compounds are proprietary small molecule allosteric activators of PP2A.  The research objectives are to establish activity in cellular models of MYCN amplified NBL and demonstrate effects on (i) transcriptional function via RNAPII CTD phosphorylation, (ii) N-MYC expression and stability at the protein level, and NMYC gene transcription; and (iii) expression of the endogenous PP2A inhibitor CIP2A at the protein and transcriptional levels.  The company will also assess the efficacy of a lead compound in a PDX mouse model of MYCN amplified NBL."
11078073,"The Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) is a tightly integrated and interdisciplinary
project, whose overarching goals are to understand the contributions and interactions of genetic, neurobiological,
and social-environmental influences on the course of AUD, remission, and recurrence over the lifespan. COGA
is a study of large, diverse families, many densely affected by AUD; family members have been characterized
in clinical, behavioral, neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and social-environmental domains, yielding a rich
phenotypic dataset paired with a large repository of biospecimens and genomewide data in 12,145 family
members, as well as molecular and cellular genomic data that provide functional insights. With recent reports of
increased heavy alcohol use and AUD in those ages 40 and older, it is critical that we gain a deeper
understanding of the risk and resilience factors throughout the course of AUD during this period of the lifespan,
and alcohol-related consequences (e.g., mental and physical health problems, cognitive decline, early mortality).
COGA builds on the key strengths of our research achievements over the past 35 years and will now focus on
adding new multi-domain data collection in those aged 40 and older to expand the longitudinal data available in
our sample as they enter later life. The breadth and depth of longitudinal assessments in COGA families allow a
fully panoramic view of the course of AUD, remission and recurrence and its consequences, enabling genomic
analyses to be conducted within lifetime accumulation of risk and protective influences.
 In response to RFA-AA-24-003, we propose three inter-related and inter-dependent projects (Lifespan,
Brain Function, Genomics) supported by three essential cores (NIAAA-COGA Sharing Repository (NCSR), Data
Management and Coordination (DMC), and Administrative). Consistent with the RFA and in keeping with
COGA’s research agenda, the overarching specific aims for the next five years are:
Aim 1: Advance our understanding of the longitudinal course of alcohol use and AUD, and its adverse outcomes
by studying genetic and social-environmental factors across the lifespan.
Aim 2: Examine how the course of AUD and remission shapes brain functioning across the lifespan, and its
consequences in later life, and the role of genetic and social-environmental factors in AUD-related brain function.
Aim 3: Integrate genetic, genomic and functional studies to characterize AUD trajectories and related mental,
behavioral and brain health outcomes across the lifespan.
 COGA’s multi-pronged approach, long history of productive collaboration among investigators, and
commitment to data sharing, will allow us to propel the alcohol research field towards actionable findings that
can be positioned to translate science to population health and clinical care. This advancement of science is only
possible within a U10 mechanism that supports effective collaboration, integration and synergy among research
modalities (lifespan, brain function, genomics) to address the serious public health challenge of AUD."
11078386,"Project Summary
Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the pathologic formation of extra-skeletal bone forming almost exclusively at
sites of mechanical stress, that occurs in ~20% of patients after hip arthroplasty, burns or musculoskeletal injury.
Currently, no therapeutics or physical therapy-based protocols exist to prevent HO. In this regard, there is a void
in our understanding of the causative mechanotransductive pathways behind this debilitating process. Our
unbiased transcription profiles in mouse HO-mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) recovered from HO sites in
combination with immunostaining of mouse and human HO revealed that a series of mechanotranduction-linked
pathways, including discoidin receptor 2 (DDR2), FAK and the Hippo effectors, YAP and TAZ, are highly
upregulated in tandem with observed changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) alignment. Using a novel, regional
MPC-specific inducible Cre system (Hoxa11-CreERT2), we have compiled preliminary data that support critical
roles for DDR2 signaling and stage-specific immobilization in both triggering FAK/YAP/TAZ signaling and MPC
lineage commitment, but also an unexpected function in controlling ECM alignment. Together, these
observations have led to our central hypothesis that MPC DDR2 signaling is necessary for mobility-induced
changes in ECM alignment that trigger aberrant osteochondral differentiation at HO sites and can be blocked by
DDR2 inhibition or injury stage-specific immobilization.
Aim 1: Define the role of DDR2 as a critical upstream regulator of FAK/YAP/TAZ signaling in controlling
the induction and progression of HO. We hypothesize that DDR2-mechanotransductive signaling alters
osteochondral differentiation and HO in vivo and can be targeted with cell specific deletion models or translatable
clinical therapies.
Aim 2: Determine the optimal post-injury timing during which MPCs can be redirected away from
aberrant osteochondral fate and pathologic ECM alignment through immobilization-based intervention.
We hypothesize that immobilization during the early proliferative phase after injury will block pathologic changes
in ECM alignment with disease-ameliorating effects on MPC fate determination and aberrant ossification.
Aim 3: Characterize the role of mobilization-induced DDR2 activation on collagen alignment/anisotropy
and mechanotransductive signaling. We hypothesize that DDR2 activity drives ECM alignment independently
of limb mobility in vivo or cyclic stretch in vitro.
Impact: The proposed studies will provide a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of how DDR2 and
joint mobility regulate ECM alignment, cell fate and HO using conditional deletion models and clinical therapies."

Aging with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is compounded by onset of behavioral and
psychiatric symptoms (BPSD) seen in over 80% of those with the condition. BPSD often precipitate caregiver
burden, institutionalized care, and increased rates of mortality. Despite the critical need, there currently are few
non-pharmacological interventions to manage BPSD and those that exist have weak evidence. Research: The
project titled, Improving Person-Environment Fit of Community-Residing Older Adults with Dementia Through
Assessment and Individualized Intervention, identifies person-environment relationships as a mechanism of
action to guide assessment of and intervention for functional behavior within the home context for persons with
ADRD. By improving the relationship between persons with ADRD and their home environment (person-
environment fit), it is hypothesized that people with ADRD will have improved BPSD and activity engagement
within their home. We will employ the NIH Stage Model of Behavioral Intervention Development to define
assessment of person-environment fit (Stage 0; Aim 1) and pilot the feasibility of a telehealth intervention to
maximize person-environment fit within the homes of community-residing adults with ADRD within rural
communities (Aim 2). Findings of this research will inform discovery of best practices for a non-pharmacological,
environmental approach to BPSD for persons with ADRD living in their home. Candidate: Dr. Elizabeth Rhodus
is an early-career investigator, who is transitioning from a NIH T32-funded postdoctoral fellowship to a full-time
tenure-track faculty position at the University of Kentucky (UK) College of Medicine. Three training goals will
enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent, successfully funded investigator: 1) Develop a strong
knowledge base on integrated physiological and behavioral assessment of person-environment interactions on
community-dwelling people living with ADRD, 2) Build expertise in development and implementation of
behavioral interventions among older adults with ADRD, and 3) Expand understanding of research strategies for
inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging studies. Mentors/Environment: The current career
development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic training, and experiential learning at the UK Center
for Health Equity Transformation with Director, Dr. Nancy Schoenberg (primary mentor), UK Sanders-Brown
Center on Aging with Associate Director, Dr. Donna Wilcock (co-mentor), Dr. Anton Porsteinsson (mentor), a
prominent clinical researcher and psychiatrist for treatment of BPSD, and a renowned, interdisciplinary advisory
committee. Dr. Rhodus will receive support from her institution through internal grants, faculty education,
networking, and scholarship. Dr. Rhodus has full support from UK (see institutional letter of support) to advance
her career development and research activities. Thus, the overall objective of this K23 application is to propel
the career development of Dr. Rhodus to an independent scientist in ADRD research using the findings of this

The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data Integration, Algorithm Development and Operations
Management Center (DAC) for NIAMS' Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program to ensure that
the research objectives are met. The objectives of BACPAC include (i) discovery of lower back pain
mechanisms through expert application of clinical and translational medicine methodologies; (ii) identification of
new interventions targeted to individual patients through knowledge of established and newly discovered
mechanisms; and (iii) evaluation of promising interventions to determine those that warrant further study,
potentially leading to regulatory approval. A successful BACPAC research program will be based on cutting
edge technologies and reflect the patient-centric focus that is critical to any investigation in this chronic and
burdensome disease. Central to this success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive DAC that
brings cohesion to research performed by the participating Mechanistic Research Centers, Technology
Research Sites, and Phase 2 Clinical Trials Centers. DAC Investigators will share their vision and provide
scientific leadership and organizational support to the BACPAC Consortium. Our research plan consists of
designing and conducting clinical trials with precision interventions in stratified patient populations. Precision
medicine interventions that focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients, instead of the best
treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this heterogenous patient population.
Key elements of the DAC that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced
leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine
learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data
management and integration system, and superior administrative support. Our communications infrastructure
will provide both public and private websites and a social media presence to effectively disseminate
appropriate information to BACPAC investigators, participants, and the public. We will develop a secure, user-
friendly advanced data management and integration system that includes web-based access for surveys, data
entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based
reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and
administration teams will provide a solid foundation to the BACPAC Research Program by facilitating meetings,
collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication
preparation across the BACPAC Consortium. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for
technology assessments, solicitation of patient input and utilities, and the evaluation of high-impact
interventions through the innovative design and sound execution of clinical trials, leading to effective
personalized treatment approaches for patients with chronic lower back pain."
11078495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent literature has identified that psoriasis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, is associated with
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). This is important since the combination of psoriasis and T2D worsen
glycemic control to a greater degree, leading to increased secondary complications than either disease alone;
however, the molecular mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop T2D are unknown. In
psoriasis, interferon kappa (IFNκ), a type I IFN, is increased in skin lesions and peripheral blood, leading to
systemic inflammation. Our preliminary data identifies that a histone methyltransferase, Mixed lineage leukemia
protein 1 (MLL1), may control IFNκ expression in keratinocytes, and this may be mechanistically driven by
Tyk2/STAT1 signaling. This overexpression of IFNk by keratinocytes is associated with increased inflammatory
macrophages (MΦs) in skin and adipose tissue and hyperglycemia development. To this end, our preliminary
data identify that keratinocyte-derived IFNκ can drive MΦs towards an inflammatory phenotype via a JMJD3-
mediated mechanism. Further, our group has identified that JMJD3, a histone demethylase, is crucial in
regulating inflammatory MΦs in skin and is upregulated in MΦs following IFNκ/JAK1/STAT3 stimulation. This
K99/R00 proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that Tyk2/STAT1 signaling upregulates MLL1 in keratinocytes
and mechanistically underlies IFNκ overexpression in psoriasis. Further, we propose that this increase in IFNκ
by psoriatic keratinocytes drives MΦs towards an inflammatory phenotype in skin and adipose tissue via a
JMJD3-mediated mechanism. These inflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) then drive adipocyte
metabolic dysfunction via regulation of PPARγ and GLUT4. To test these hypotheses, We will pursue the
following aims during the K99 phase of this award: AIM 1: Identify the MLL1-mediated mechanism(s) by which
keratinocyte IFNκ expression is regulated in psoriasis tissue, AIM 2: Examine the mechanism(s) by which
keratinocyte-derived IFNκ regulates MΦ phenotype in psoriasis. During this time, the PI will receive research

Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease, yet the emergence of drug-resistant variants
and comorbidities after long-term ART remain a concern. Therefore, alternative approaches to inhibit infection
and cure AIDS are needed. The proposed “Pittsburgh Center for HIV Protein Interactions” (U54 PCHPI) is well-
positioned to succeed in the search for the much-needed alternative targets for HIV-1 suppression. The U54
PCHPI is a highly integrated, collaborative effort, building on established productive collaborations. The
fundamental research program will focus on structurally characterizing HIV-1 protein and protein-nucleic acid
complexes involved in three aspects of infection: HIV-1 assembly and maturation, ingress and nuclear entry, and
integration. Studies to address these stages of the infection cycle will be carried out in three projects, each
focused on one of these areas, and in four scientific cores (Computational, Cryo-EM/ET, NMR and Virology)
along with Administrative and Developmental cores. Importantly, our program will work to define the structural
basis underlying maturation and allosteric integrase inhibitor activities to promote a mechanistic understanding
and seeks to identify paths of resistance development. Further, we will identify new targets for inhibition of HIV-
1 by defining interaction interfaces within capsid-host protein/nucleic acid complexes involved in trafficking,
nuclear entry, and integration, with a particular focus on native pre-integration complexes (PICs). We will also
develop tools for examining capsid interactions under near-native conditions (in situ NMR spectroscopy and
single-molecule CLEM for HIV-1). In addition, a robust management plan, implemented via an Administrative
Core, will ensure a cohesive effort with frequent and transparent communications, while our mission to facilitate
research career development will be enabled by a collaborative development program, a mentoring program,
and a researcher embedding program, among other initiatives in the Developmental Core. Upon completion of
our aims, we expect to have identified and characterized, at high resolution, several previously
unknown/uncharacterized interaction interfaces in HIV-1 protein complexes, alone and with inhibitors, between
HIV-1 RNA and proteins, and within PIC components, including retroviral intasome interactions with host
chromatin. Detailed knowledge of such interfaces will enable structure-guided improvements in inhibitor design
as well as identify potential new targets for inhibition."

Developmental stuttering is a common speech disorder characterized by prolongations, blocks, and repetitions
of speech sounds. Studies of developmental stuttering within twin, family, and population isolates suggest a
strong genetic influence on stuttering risk with heritability estimates ranging from 0.42 to 0.84. Population-wide
studies suggest that stuttering genetic risk factors are complex and involve both familial and population-level
variation. In the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of stuttering, we identified 57 unique genome-
wide significant loci associated with self-reported stuttering risk. Despite these population and familial efforts,
the functional role that genetic variation contributes to stuttering risk remains largely uncharacterized. The current
work proposes to use extant self-report stuttering GWAS results and newly genotyped and sequenced whole-
exome data to better understand the biological mechanisms contributing to stuttering risk. Aim 1 will explore
the genetically regulated gene expression associated with self-reported stuttering by leveraging GWAS
summary statistics in over 1.1 million cases and controls. We will perform sex- and ancestry-specific
transcriptome-wide association analyses using Joint-Tissue Imputation, prioritizing brain and neuromuscular
tissues. We will assess consistency and generalizability of the genetically regulated gene expression associated
with self-reported stuttering in independent sex- and ancestry- specific analyses in two independent cohorts -
the International Stuttering Project and the Adolescent Health study. To explore the role of rare functional
variation, Aim 2 will pinpoint familial genetic effects of developmental stuttering. Using array and whole-
exome sequenced data collected in over 200 families, we will perform a novel polygenic risk-adjusted multipoint
linkage analysis approach, conduct transmission disequilibrium tests, apply a pedigree variant annotation
analysis search tool (pVAAST), and meta-analyze rare and common gene-based results developed in Aim 1.
Aim 3 will identify neural endophenotypes related to stuttering-associated genes. We will utilize a newly
developed tool, NeuroimaGene, to assess the genetic relationship between stuttering associated genes from
Aims 1, 2, and the literature with neural endophenotypes measured in more than 33,000 people in the
UKBiobank. Results from Aim 3 will illuminate specific neural mechanisms contributing to stuttering risk via
genetic mechanisms and will be compared to results from the literature on brain imaging in people who stutter.
Together, these aims will characterize functional relationships contributing to stuttering risk, better inform our
understanding of stuttering, as well as potentially inform clinical and therapeutic practices."

There are approximately a quarter of a billion people worldwide chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
who are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The loss of life due to HBV-related
complications each year is about 820,000 people. At the same time human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects
about 38 million people worldwide. Among those, 7.4% globally and 15-28% in highly endemic areas are also
infected with HBV. HIV co-infections pose a serious health burden as they accelerate the progression to liver
cirrhosis and liver cancer with mechanisms that are still not well understood.
 Chronicity of HBV infections is linked to the stability and maintenance of the covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which is the nuclear form of the HBV genome. As HBV infects human hepatocytes in the liver, the
cccDNA is established in these cells and strategies that aim to inactivate or eliminate it are considered the
solution to a functional cure. Current treatments against chronic HBV include nucleoside analogs and interferon
α. While nucleoside analogs do not directly affect the cccDNA, a limited number of patients that receive interferon
α or nucleoside analogs can resolve the infection and achieve a cure. The need for a global HBV cure is urgent,
which is also why several approaches and investigational compounds aim for a cure.
 HBV is an exclusive hepatotropic virus that only infects human hepatocytes. HBV studies have been hindered
by limited cell culture systems that include hepatoma cells after overexpression of the HBV receptor NTCP and
primary human hepatocytes. The latter are the most physiologically relevant cells, but their availability and the
inherent limitations of primary cells makes it difficult to use them to recapitulate the complete HBV lifecycle. To
this end, we have developed cell culture systems based on primary human hepatocytes, isolated from
humanized mice, that efficiently support long-term HBV infection and spread. Moreover, we developed a system
of isolating these cells from HBV-infected humanized mice which provides unique opportunities for research.
Specifically, cells are chronically infected with HBV and therefore carry high levels of cccDNA, which allows for
modeling chronic HBV in vitro. Here we propose to use these innovative hepatocyte systems to establish robust
co-cultures with CD4+ T cells for studying HIV/HBV co-infections in physiologically relevant primary cell culture
systems. Overall, with our proposed work we will gain insights on the effects of HIV co-infection on HBV lifecycle
and hepatocyte responses and we will establish a platform to identify novel antiviral strategies with the goal for
a functional HBV cure."
11069378,"Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a significant clinical challenge affecting over half
of the 28 million cancer survivors. There are no approved therapies to prevent CIPN, and off-label use of
drugs (e.g., duloxetine) are marginally effective while associated with adverse side effects. Taxanes are
among the most neurotoxic agents, resulting in dose limiting CIPN that can impact cancer survival.
Chronic pain and potentially permanent nerve damage have a long-term impact on the quality of life for
over 30% of cancer survivors.
Serpin Pharma’s SP16 is a safe, first-in-class, anti-inflammatory drug with regenerative and analgesic
functions after peripheral nerve injury. SP16 activates LRP1, a key signaling receptor regulating several
factors contributing to peripheral neuropathy. Through SP16’s unique mechanism, damaging
inflammation is mitigated, the immune response is rebalanced, and tissues are protected against further
damage, creating an entirely new class of anti-inflammatory drugs void of immunosuppressive and its
associated harmful side effects. SP16 has demonstrated direct analgesic and regenerative effects and
thus provides a unique strategy to address the root cause of CIPN.
Our key proof-of-principle data from the phase 1 studies demonstrate that LRP1 is a potential therapeutic
target in CIPN, and treatment with the LRP1 agonist, SP16, alleviates sensory neuropathy in translational
models of taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy. Importantly, SP16 does not interfere with the anti-
cancer activity of several classes of chemotherapy, including taxane agents, a critical safeguard control
for using SP16 in conjunction with chemotherapy. This project aims to develop SP16 as a preventative
treatment for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, with the initial target population being breast
cancer patients receiving taxane-based agents. Pre-clinical studies are planned to confirm the
appropriate dose range for the clinical trial and complete the remaining IND-enabling studies. An IND
(investigational new drug) packet will be submitted for FDA approval. The safety and tolerability of SP16
will be evaluated in a Phase 1b escalating dose trial in breast cancer patients treated with paclitaxel.
SP16 will be administered with the standard of care (SOC) once per chemotherapy treatment cycle. The
primary endpoints of this study will focus on the safety of SP16 in breast cancer patients with exploratory
outcomes aimed at preventing CIPN. These outcomes will help define the dosing and endpoints for the
future Phase 2 clinical study demonstrating the efficacy of SP16. After the Phase 2 clinical trial is
completed, Serpin Pharma plans to license SP16 to a pharmaceutical partner for Phase 3 studies, drug
approval, and commercialization. SP16 is a complete, therapeutic solution to address an acute, unmet
clinical need affecting a significant cancer patient population."
11070789,"In the natural world, animals rely heavily on their sense of smell to safely navigate their environment, and experimentally mice can be taught complex decision-making tasks which rely on the animal's ability to integrate experience and olfactory stimulus. Association of context and olfactory stimuli is thought to be achieved through the encoding and retrieval of memories through the hippocampus. The hippocampus, a curved structure nestled deep within the temporal lobe of the brain, serves three primary functions: the regulation of emotions, formation of new memories, and memory retrieval. It plays a vital role in the creation, organization, and retention of fresh memories, as well as in linking certain sensations and emotions (valence) to these memories. The dorsal and ventral hippocampus regions have been implicated in acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of temporal information in optogenetic stimulation of trace fear conditioning by a significant number of studies and importantly, lesions to dorsal CA1 (dCA1) result in impaired memory retrieval. Calbindin 2 pyramidal cells in dCA1 have additionally been implicated in learning during the go-no go associative discrimination task, as inhibition slows learning. Interestingly, within dCA1 exists a population of pyramidal cells that during the go-no go associative learning task demonstrate divergent stimulus responses, which take place at discrete times during the go-no go task, thereby exhibiting ‘time tiling’. This can be thought of as temporally discrete divergence in activity related to stimulus valence and are called ‘decision-predicting time cells’. With the recent discovery of decision-predicting time cells, there is currently no literature investigating their molecular composition, their influence on behavior, and their interactions with interneurons. Of note, it has been demonstrated that PV interneurons play crucial roles not only in regulating the excitability of cell populations, but also in providing precisely timed inhibitory input. Currently, no studies have characterized the roles of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in dCA1 hippocampus during complex olfactory discrimination tasks, particularly related to decision-predicting time cells. Aim 1 will probe if decision-predicting time cells and calbindin 2 positive and utilize advanced optical techniques such as two-photon holographic stimulation to selectively impair divergent time tiled responses. Aim 2 will characterize the role of PV interneurons related to decision-predicting time cell activity and determine the effect on licking behavior and accuracy during the go-no go olfactory task if PV interneurons are inhibited during the task."
11071754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding individual differences in language comprehension and use in autism is a top priority of autism
research, as acquisition of language early in life is consistently linked with long-term social, academic, and
vocational outcomes in individuals on the autism spectrum. However, studying language of infants and young
children who will later be diagnosed with autism is difficult due to the challenges of reliably diagnosing autism
in the first 3 years of life, when expressive language develops rapidly. Studying infants who are known to be at
increased familial likelihood for autism and language disorder (e.g., based on their status as younger siblings
of at least one older autistic child) allows researchers to better understand what factors may predict expressive
language in infants who are likely to go on to have autism and/or developmental language disorder. Recent
work focused on this population has investigated what caregiver factors influence language development, as
caregivers are infants’ primary communication partners and help to scaffold language development by
providing linguistic input and facilitating contingent transactions. One such factor is caregiver stress, as
caregivers of autistic children report experiencing high levels of stress. In previous work, PI Markfeld found
preliminary support for a model whereby perceived, parenting-related stress was indirectly associated with
expressive language in toddlerhood via caregiver linguistic input in the home environment in a sample of
infants at increased likelihood for autism. The current project will extend the applicant’s prior work in multiple
ways. Aim 1 will expand the characterization and measurement of caregiver stress by collecting a measure of
stressful life experiences (i.e., objective stressors) in infants at increased familial likelihood for autism. Aim 2
will examine associations between perceived and objective caregiver stress, caregiver linguistic input, and
child language outcomes later into childhood (i.e., at age 3 years) in infants at increased familial likelihood for
autism. Aim 3 will assess whether this model of how caregiver stress influences child language outcomes may
generalize to a larger sample of infants recruited from the general population. It is hypothesized that caregivers
of infants at high likelihood for autism will report higher levels of perceived and objective stress relative to
caregivers of infants at lower likelihood for autism, but that the conceptual model whereby caregiver stress
influences child expressive language via caregiver linguistic input will hold for all caregivers and infants. The
comprehensive training plan will advance PI Markfeld’s skills in measurement of caregiver stress and child
language, characterization of autism and language disorders, and application of advanced approaches to
statistical analyses. If the hypotheses are borne out, this work has the potential to pinpoint novel targets for
early intervention that are intended to support optimal language outcomes for all infants. Improved
understanding of the predictors and mechanisms by which infants learn language has the potential to guide
future efforts in working with families to mitigate the long-term impacts of language learning difficulties."

The FaCT core will provide the biomedical engineering support needed for RPLs and others to fully engage in 
the development, synthesis, and validation of devices, sensors, and systems to be used in foundational or 
applied biomedical research and/or clinical-translational work in the COBRE in Convergent Engineering and 
Biomolecular Science (CEBS). This innovative engineering-focused core will be a consolidation of four existing 
research cores in the College of Engineering, three of which are already recharge centers. The FaCT core will 
merge the Idaho Microfabrication Lab IML), the Boise State Center for Materials Characterization (BSCMC), 
the Engineering Research Support ERS) center, and the Biomedical Engineering Center (BEC). To meet 
CEBS COBRE goals, researchers must be able to fabricate a wide range of devices and structures from 
simple mechanical devices to more sophisticated sensors through machining, printing, or microfabrication. 
After fabrication, researchers will also need to be able to characterize physical, optical, and electrical 
properties of the devices/sensors to assess their performance for the required research. Hence, each research 
effort will require use of a variety of tools, instruments, processes, and expertise supplied by FaCT core 
facilities and personnel. The FaCT core will be overseen by a new Core Director who will consolidate the four 
facilities administratively, enhance the focus to increase biomedical engineering usage, and manage 
personnel, equipment, and facilities. The Core Director will establish the recharge rates for the BEC as it 
becomes a recharge center, and oversee annual assessments of recharge rates across the entire facility. To 
incentivize CEBs responsive research in the FaCT core, a voucher program will be established to pay recharge 
service costs. Finally, the FaCT core will join the ranks of core facilities at BSU, the state of Idaho, and the 
Mountain West that are promoted by the INBRE and RAIN programs for use by biomedical researchers in 
academia, government, and private industry."
10823755,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BROWN 
Stress Fracture is a common and highly destructive overuse musculoskeletal injury that may be successfully 
treated with a brief reduction in physical activity. Yet, we currently lack the scientific knowledge and technical 
capacity to accurately assess bone damage in time to allow practitioners an opportunity to prescribe the rest 
necessary to avoid fracture development. The long-term goal is to enhance scientific knowledge of stress 
fracture development, and improve researcher and clinician ability to predict and accurately detect individuals 
at risk for stress fracture. The project hypothesis in this application is practitioners can diagnose stress fracture 
risk prior to injury by detecting abnormal tibial loading and bone microdamage before injury development. The 
rationale for this work is that enabling early and accurate diagnosis of tibial stress fracture may be key for 
efficacious prevention and treatment modalities, and a substantial reduction in the incidence of this destructive 
musculoskeletal injury. The project hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Quantify tibial 
bone loads across a range of physical activities; (2) Develop statistical model of tibial loading during physical 
activity; and (3) Automate ultrasound use to detect tibial stress fracture. For the first and second aims, we will 
collect biomechanical data to evaluate tibial loading during conditions commonly encountered during outdoor 
physical activity for individuals with and without history of tibial stress fracture, and mechanically load a tibia to 
develop a statistical model of bone loading experienced during single and repeated bouts of physical activity. 
For the third aim, we will collect ultrasound images of a tibia shortly after stress fracture and after fracture 
symptoms have subsided to standardize image acquisition and analysis techniques to automate detection of 
injury. The proposed research is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it seeks to expand foundational 
knowledge regarding tibial stress fracture development that can be implemented to facilitate accurate 
identification of individuals at risk for stress fracture and enable early detection of the tibial damage that is a 
precursor to injury. The proposed research is significant because it will provide the wider scientific community 
the valuable knowledge to immediately improve tibial stress fracture diagnosis and treatment, as well as a 
strong scientific foundation to develop effective prevention and rehabilitative strategies for this common 
musculoskeletal injury. Collectively, these tangible benefits have potential to substantially reduce the 
prevalence of this common overuse injury."
10984226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 83% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenging eating behaviors (CEBs), which
lead to clear health risks (e.g., obesity, malnutrition) and up to45-90% present with co-occurring gastrointestinal
(GI} symptoms. Parents face significant challenges with these behaviors resulting in increased stress, mealtime
accommodations, and family burden. Further, the symptoms of ASD are certainly recognized as heterogeneous
and the same is true of CEBs, where different behavioral factors often overlap within the child. Due to this
complexity, there is currently no standard of care to treat these behaviors in ASD. Because CEBsare a significant
clinical issue there is a need to use dynamic methods that account for intraindividual biobehavioral mechanisms
to inform novel personalized treatments. To address such a complicated health issue, we will use the
biopsychosocialapproach. One novel area, which assesses both the socia/and biological components of eating,
is interpersonal autonomic physiological synchrony (PS). PS occurs when behaviors and physiological arousal
are co-regulated between a parent and child. Strong parental sensitivity is linked to greater levels of PS and can
buffer a child's response to stressors. Yet, parent stress and anxiety can also override a child's cues. Since
parent stress is linked to CEBs the same overriding strategies, while well-intentioned, may occur at mealtime.
Biosensors used to assess PS have demonstrated clinical utility in autism but have not been used to uncover
how parent-child PS may influence CEBs in ASD. Second, parents often report their child's eating patterns are
highly variable, and it is difficult to determine what changes may have predicted this variability. Ecological
momentary assessment (EMA} gathers real-time, naturalistic, intraindividual information, thus reducing recall
bias from families about psychological states prior to a behavior of interest. Third, given the increase in cooccurring
GI symptoms, emerging research in autism is focusing on the gut-brain axis as a biomarker by linking
microbiome diversity to the autism phenotype. Understanding the link between biological microbiane
mechanisms and how these relate to CEBs is necessary to develop comprehensive treatment approaches. Aims
include: Aim 1: Examine dyadic, ambulatory physiological data during naturalistic mealtime observations in the
home for children with ASD and TD children. Aim 2: Determine how real-time intraindividual parent, child, and
environmental factors predict child dietary intake at mealtime using EMA. Aim 3: Explore the relationship
between the microbiome diversity, physiological synchrony, child eating behaviors, and child dietary intake.
Training will support development in: 1) PS and arousal data; 2) EMA methodology, 3) microbiane
methodology, 4) clinical knowledge focusing on underrepresented populations, and 5) professional development.
The long-term goal of this K23 is to inform the development of personalized treatment approaches and potential
biomarkers of treatment response. This is critical given the serious health consequences of CEBs in ASD."
11073250,"Summary of Work
Glucagon is canonically viewed as an essential counterregulatory hormone that prevents hypoglycemia by driving
endogenous glucose production (EGP) in the liver. We and others have revealed additional roles for glucagon
that emphasize a much more complex control of metabolism beyond hypoglycemia. On such role is our studies
revealing the potent insulinotropic actions of glucagon in β-cells, which we have shown to be essential for
postprandial glucose control. Glucagon production in α-cells comes from the specific processing of a proglucagon
peptide by prohormone convertase 2 (PC2). Emerging literature has proposed that α-cells can differentially
process the proglucagon hormone to produce glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) through a distinct prohoromone
convertase; PC1. GLP-1 is a much more potent insulinotropic peptide, which would enhance α- to β-cell
communication and insulin secretion to a greater extent than glucagon. Our work in human subjects has
suggested that α- to β-cell communication becomes greater contributor to insulin secretion with increase
metabolic stress, raising the hypothesis that mechanisms that enhance this axis may do so a compensatory
mechanism to enhance insulin secretion in the setting of increase peripheral insulin resistance that associates
with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have generated several mouse models that support this hypothesis
with strong preliminary data and propose here to move this hypothesis into a translational setting. We will utilize
preclinical studies in human islets as well as clinical studies in human subjects to test the importance of α- to β-
cell communication for insulin secretion across the metabolic spectrum and enhance our understanding of how
α-cells process proglucagon peptides to support β-cell function. This work has direct implications in the
understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D as well as the mechanisms by which incretin-based drugs control
glucose homeostasis."
11076986,"DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathways resolve DNA lesions that arise during cellular
metabolism or as the by-product of cell damage. Human DSB repair pathways fall into two distinct categories:
end joining (EJ) pathways that rejoin the DSB molecule, and homology directed repair (HDR) pathways that use
a template molecule to repair the DSB molecule. The factors that cells use to decide between EJ and HDR repair
pathways remain incompletely defined. Many studies have shown that the cell cycle regulates DSB pathway
choice, yet cultures arrested at points in the cell cycle that favor HDR still repair the majority of DSBs using EJ.
The long-term goal of the research in my lab is to comprehensively define factors that bias DSB repair in sufficient
detail that we can predict DSB repair outcomes based on the initial conditions inside a cell. Pursuit of this goal
will improve our understanding of DNA repair and related processes, enable new generations of gene editing
reagents with greatly increased efficacy, and suggest new strategies to diagnose and treat human DNA repair
pathologies, including cancer and aging.
 Over the next five years, we will develop a holistic model for DSB repair that describes DNA repair events
occurring on the DSB and template molecules. Our goals in generating this model are to define the irreversible
commitment step between EJ/HDR and to understand if cells sense their capacity to perform HDR before they
pass commitment. These are important challenges for the cell, because inappropriate HDR can cause cell death
or genomic instability. We hypothesize that cells have the heretofore unmeasured ability to develop DSB repair
complexes in parallel, and that parallel maturation of DSB repair complexes plays a role both in the EJ/HDR
commitment and as a checkpoint for these repair pathways. Parallel development of EJ and HDR complexes
either on the DSB molecule or split between the DSB and template molecule would allow cells to simultaneously
develop different types of repair before committing to one or the other. The ability to generate mature repair
complexes prior to commitment would make DNA repair substantially less risky. Our practical approach is to
develop genomic and proteomic techniques that allow us to measure DSB repair intermediates with
unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We will use these techniques to define how protein complexes
associate with chromatin over time and, crucially, the strandedness of DNA bound to DSB repair proteins.
Measuring this latter parameter will allow us to determine when events occur in relation to the EJ/HDR decision
and thus understand when and how this decision is made. We also explore mechanisms of communication
between multiple DSB repair complexes assembled in parallel onto chromatin. Parallel events are especially
informative because they indicate a dynamic system in which cells simultaneously explore multiple DSB repair
pathways, thereby preserving choice until repair is nearly complete. For example, events on the template
molecule may act as a checkpoint for events on the DSB molecule, or vice versa.
 This work will enable new tools that leverage our understanding of DSB repair to influence gene editing
outcomes and to improve therapeutic workflows. We also anticipate that our work will open new fields of inquiry,
for example defining how DSB repair complexes assembled interact with each other and with cell-wide signaling
mechanisms."
11075459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inhibitory control deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), with clear
manifestations seen in psychophysiological, electrophysiological, and neuroanatomical measures of these
processes. Addressing these symptoms is of critical clinical relevance since they are a main predictor of negative
vocational and psychosocial outcomes. An intriguing set of findings has suggested physical activity and exercise
can have a positive effect on SSD symptomatology, but the exercise-linked neural changes that may result in
improved inhibitory control is unknown. Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) technologies enable the assessment
of cognitive control processes in participants using high-density electroencephalography (hd-EEG) during task
performance and physical activity. During the F99 phase, using cutting-edge MoBI technologies, I will test if a
single acute walking intervention will mitigate behavioral and neurophysiological indices of inhibitory control
deficits in SSDs (Aim 1A) and if individuals with SSDs showing significant improvement in inhibitory control
performance and normalization of inhibition-related event-related-potential (ERP) components to neurotypical
adults have less severe psychosis symptoms (Aim 1B). In Aim 2, I examine the underlying structural-functional
neural bases and behavior of disturbances in cognitive control and sensory processing among people with and
at risk for SSDs. Upon completion of both phases, I will become a multimodal neuroimaging and computational
psychiatry expert in SSDs. Learning neuroimaging methods (fMRI) and computational models to stimulate the
complex dynamics of brain function and behavior, alongside environmental factors, will enable me to identify the
underlying mechanisms of SSDs and propel the field forward in developing personalized treatments. The training
received during the F99/K00 phases will prepare me for the transition to a faculty position at a R1 institution,
where I will lead a distinguished neuroscience program and implement diversity initiatives to address issues
related to diversity and inclusion in neuroscience. As an expert in multimodal neuroimaging and computational
psychiatry, I will persist in exploring similar K00 research, now focusing on individuals who are D/deaf or hard-
of-hearing (D/HH) with psychosis to investigate variations of sensory-cognitive neural circuits generating auditory
and visual hallucinations, as well as develop personalized treatment algorithms. I am firmly committed to
providing practical, tractable solutions to individuals with SSDs through basic knowledge."
11075473,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Many survivors of respiratory infections (i.e., pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2) have subsequent incident dementia
causing decreased quality of life and are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. The cause of this association between pneumonia and dementia is unknown. It is also unknown how
bacterial pneumonia causes neurovascular unit dysfunction. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen capable
of causing bacterial pneumonia and can elicit cytotoxic tau from the mouse lung and induce neuronal tau seeding,
reduce dendritic spine density, and impair synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice. Additionally, I have shown
that P. aeruginosa causes microglia and astrocyte activation, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and tau pathology
in wild-type mice 24 hours post-infection. At lower doses of P. aeruginosa, I have seen microglia activation but
no blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Microglia can influence blood-brain barrier breakdown and tau pathology as
well as regulate neuroimmune pathways. Taken together, this has led to the hypothesis that pneumonia first
causes microglia activation, leading to blood-brain barrier breakdown, and tau phosphorylation in the brain. Using
a quadruple labeled mouse model (PrismPlus), I will image longitudinally from just 3 hours post-infection to
elucidate the temporal resolution and mechanisms of neurovascular unit dysfunction in the brain. I will also
assess neurovascular unit dysfunction in matched pneumonia vs. non-pneumonia post-mortem brain and lung
tissue. This project will be the first step towards developing novel and effective therapies to protect neurovascular
function in patients with severe lung infections, while allowing me to master the amazing technique of multiphoton
imaging of mouse brain through a cranial window. Migraine disorders have a global prevalence of approximately
15% and are the third highest cause of disability-adjusted life years. However, much is still unknown about the
pathology of migraines, particularly at the capillary level, and more effective treatments are needed. For the K00
phase, I will utilize my mastery of intravital imaging of the neurovascular unit at the capillary level, to investigate
neurovascular and neuroimmune mechanisms in migraine mouse models."

11080062,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The parent grant leverages the rich, longitudinal data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
Study and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and uses a data-driven approach to characterize the
cognitive heterogeneity of subtle cognitive difficulties in older adults who do not yet show cognitive impairment
consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. We are then examining the mid- and late-life
vascular, physical activity, and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) biomarker predictors of subtle
cognitive decline phenotypes (e.g., low-executive, low-memory) as well as rates of decline on ADRD outcomes.
The current proposal for a research supplement to promote diversity in health-related research would provide
funding for Fareshte Erani to complete a postdoctoral fellowship in my lab. Through this supplement, she is
proposing to extend the parent RF1 to conduct a novel examination of mid- and late-life depressive symptoms
on cognitive and biological outcomes in older adults. Her long-term career goal is to be an ADRD researcher
with an independent research program focused on the intersection of neuropsychiatric factors, neural networks,
and cognitive decline in order to guide individualized intervention efforts. Support from the diversity supplement
will leverage her existing expertise while also providing Ms. Erani with advanced training and mentorship in
ADRD research, depression and relevant cognitive outcomes and mechanisms, skills to conduct longitudinal
statistical analyses, and tools to submit an NIA K-award application.
 Depression has been associated with lower cognitive performance in older adults and increased risk for
dementia; however, there is likely considerable heterogeneity in causal mechanisms since longstanding, chronic
depression could be a causal link to subsequent cognitive impairment and/or late-life depression could be co-
occurring with an ADRD process. The proposed study will use ARIC and BLSA data to investigate the role of
depression onset and cognitive decline by examining associations of mid- and late-life onset depressive
symptoms with cognitive and biological outcomes. Specifically, we will 1) examine the extent to which mid- and
late-life depressive symptoms among cognitively unimpaired older adults predict late-life subtle cognitive decline
phenotypes and progression to MCI/dementia and 2) examine the associations of mid- and late-life depressive
symptoms with fronto-cingulate regions on neuroimaging, markers of inflammation, and ADRD plasma markers.
We will also explore neuroimaging, inflammatory, and ADRD biomarker variables that mediate the associations
of mid- and late-life depressive symptoms and subtle cognitive decline. Examining the associations between
depressive symptom onset, profiles of subtle cognitive difficulties, and the neural mechanisms that link
depressive symptoms and cognitive decline will enhance our understanding of the directionality of depression-
cognition associations and identify targets for personalized treatment plans."
11072714,"Abstract
More than 10% of the U.S. population seeks care for spine pain each year with rates of surgical procedures on
the rise. One of the most challenging yet common sequelae of lumbar spine surgery is chronic post-surgical
pain (CPSP). CPSP is associated with poor physical function and remains difficult to treat. Indeed, it is
frequently treated with opioid medications, despite evidence that long term opioid use for the treatment of
chronic pain may not be effective and may increase the risk of overdose-related death. Therefore, the need to
prevent the transition from acute to chronic post-surgical pain is great, especially for patients undergoing
lumbar spine surgery. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a psychosocial intervention that has
been effective in improving physical function and quality of life among patients with chronic pain as well
treating opioid use disorders. Thus, it stands to reason that ACT may be a promising tool for the prevention of
CPSP and long-term opioid use. It has also been modified into brief formats in order increase adherence and
minimize treatment barriers such as cost and access. The present study aims to adapt and modify a brief
presurgical ACT intervention aimed at preventing the transition to CPSP and reducing long-term opioid use.
We will then assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the finalized intervention to
prevent the transition to CPSP and reduce post-surgical opioid use six months following lumbar spine
surgery. Finally, we will identify psychosocial and psychophysical phenotypes associated with response to
this intervention. Together, this study will afford me the opportunity to gain training in treatment
development and implementation and development and execution of clinical trial while advancing my long-
term goal of developing mechanistically-based nonpharmacologic interventions to prevent the development
of CPSP and reduce the risk of long-term opioid use."
11067610,"2Morrow, Inc. CRP Grant Application – Project Summary:
Chronic pain affects roughly 1 in 5 adults. Managing chronic pain is complex, and the reality for most patients
is that living a life free of pain is unlikely. Over 50% of patients with chronic pain also experience depression or
anxiety, and medical providers often lack the time, training or resources to address these emotional challenges.
This can leave patients feeling uncared about and providers feeling frustrated. Despite national guidelines that
recommend incorporating scalable behavioral interventions when managing pain, there continues to be an
overreliance on addictive pain medications. Given the need for HEAL-aligned pain management options such
as behavioral-based treatments, 2Morrow set out to design, develop, and test a novel evidence-based digital
behavioral therapeutic for individuals living with chronic pain with FAST-TRACK SBIR HEAL grant funding (#1
R44 AT 11593) aimed at reducing the negative impact of pain on daily life with educational content, skill
development, pain awareness tools, and coaching. Our SBIR feasibility RCT study is nearing completion
(August 2024) and shows strong engagement, positive feedback, and a decrease in pain interference. Our
focus is now shifting to dissemination and commercialization. The landscape for digital therapeutics presents
unique challenges, notably in the realms of investment expectations and the absence of established payment
and commercialization models. This complexity is compounded by the fact that, typically, it takes about 17
years for evidence-based practices to gain widespread adoption in the medical community. To counter this
trend and expedite the integration of our digital therapeutic, we need to validate commercial traction. Thus we
are applying for this HEAL Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Program: Embedded Entrepreneurs for
Small Businesses in Pain Management (SB1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed) that will fund the hiring of a Chief
Commercial Officer (CCO) to accelerate the dissemination and commercialization of this product by focusing
on partner development.
Specific Aim 1: Hire a fractional (50% effort) CCO or equivalent experienced professional. Specific Aim 2:
During the first 90 days, the CCO will review, validate, and update 2Morrow’s commercialization plan. To do
this they will meet with the 2Morrow team, and at least 10 stakeholders or industry experts to 1) understand the
landscape and current business models, 2) understand current options and workflow, and 3) validate/refine
2Morrow’s go-to-market strategy. Specific Aim 3: The CCO will execute the commercialization/partnership
plan with a focus on advancing a business development pipeline that leads to key milestones such as a signed
partnership agreement or strategic investment."

so that he will be more competitive for getting into graduate school and more successful as a researcher. The
following is the abstract from the main grant.
 Visual working memory plays a fundamental role in visual perception and visually guided behavior, and
much has been learned about the nature of this memory system by studies using arrays of artificial but easily
controlled stimuli (e.g., arrays of colored disks or oriented Gabor patches). However, current quantitative
models of visual working memory based on these artificial stimuli cannot be readily extended to the kinds of
complex, structured scenes that humans face in daily life. The central goal of the proposed research is to
develop and test a new quantitative approach to understanding the representation of complex objects and
scenes in working memory, which will lead to a better understanding of real-world vision.
 In our model, a scene is represented in visual working memory as a noisier version of the pattern of
activation that was produced during the perception of that scene. We model this by feeding the scene into a
neural network model of the ventral object recognition pathway and using the resulting pattern of activation
across the population of units (the population vector) as a model of the working memory representation. We
then use this model to make predictions about both behavioral performance and neural activity in human
subjects. For example, the change detection task involves presenting a sample scene followed after delay by a
test scene and asking subjects to report whether the two scenes are the same or different. We can model this
task by feeding the sample and test scenes into the model and computing the distance between the population
vectors for the sample and test scenes. In our preliminary data, we find that the distance between the vectors
can predict behavioral change detection performance extremely well. Moreover, we find that the vector for the
sample scene can predict the pattern of neural activity during the delay between the sample and test scenes
(measured via event-related potentials). Note that previous quantitative models of visual working memory
cannot make any predictions at all for the natural scenes used in these preliminary studies.
 We propose testing and extending this model in several ways. First, we will conduct several experiments to
assess the ability of the model to predict behavioral performance and neural activity across a broad range of
natural stimuli. Second, we will compare the ability of population vectors from different cortical regions (as
estimated from the model and from fMRI data) to predict behavioral performance and delay-period activity,
providing new insights into the specific brain regions that underlie visual working memory. Third, we will
determine whether our model can predict performance in visually guided tasks (e.g., visual search) that rely on
visual working memory. Finally, we will assess different versions of our model that implement competing
mechanisms for producing capacity limitations, and we will compare the ability of these models to account for
behavioral performance for both natural scenes and classic examples of artificial stimuli. Together, these
experiments will provide a new and broader understanding of visual working memory."
11042609,"Tranquility Biodesign is developing an innovative approach for immunomodulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) through engineered bacterial anticancer therapeutics. Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer with few therapeutic options. Immunomodulation of TME can improve responses to current therapies by re-activating suppressed immune cell activity. Tranquility intends to combine an attenuated strain of Brucella melitensis, Bm∆vjbR, with a genetically engineered biosynthetic cluster that includes the enzyme toluene ortho-monooxygenase (Bm∆vjbR-TOM). This allows conversion of tryptophan to hydroxyindole (HI), a potent immunomodulatory compound. Preliminary data has shown that treatment of tumor cells with HI promotes tumor suppressive immunomodulatory effects including activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, and promotion of tumor-suppressive CD4+ T-cell differentiation. Importantly, Bm∆vjbR has also been tested for safety in immunosufficient and immunodeficient mice, as well as non-human primates and pregnant goats and sheep. In each of these systems, the bacterium displayed exceptional safety profiles. To validate the potential of Bm∆vjbR-TOM for the development of a bacterial anticancer therapeutic, the Bm∆vjbR strain will first be engineered to express the TOM enzyme through genomic integration, and TOM enzymatic activity will be validated through chromogenic assays. Then, the anticancer efficacy of the resultant strain will be characterized against MCC tumor growth in immune-competent as well as humanized NOD/SCID mouse models. Upon completion of this proposal, proof of concept for Bm∆vjbR-TOM as a new potential candidate for anticancer therapeutic development will be demonstrated."
11044361,"Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is a rare, inherited disorder typically caused by mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a tumor suppressor gene involved in the Wnt signaling pathway that prevents uncontrolled cell growth. FAP is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous (benign) polyps in the colon and/or rectum, and over the patient's lifetime there is an almost 100% likelihood that the disorder will develop into colorectal cancer. The field of cancer vaccines is continuously developing and has shown promise as a means of preventing development of cancers through immune stimulation against tumor-associated protein/peptides (neoantigens). Chimeron Bio's ChaESAR™ nanoparticle is a biosynthetic, self-assembling nanoparticle vector encasing a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) capable of expressing one or more proteins of interest (POIs). In this study, we propose to develop a ChaESAR™ nanoparticle expressing mutated APC peptides as a cancer vaccine. Additionally, we will utilize the ChaESAR™ particle's multiplexing capabilities to co-express one or more additional neoantigens commonly observed in FAP, including (but not limited to) KRAS, ASXL1, Fbxw7, and Sox9, as a means of producing a more robust immune response against the disorder."

11078092,"Summary/Abstract of Parent Grant
As advanced age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), targeting
detrimental age-related processes may lead to effective therapies. Mitochondrial dysfunction
and pro-inflammatory signaling are each thought to be key drivers of aging and AD. However, a
clear understanding of the connections between mitochondrial homeostasis, immune signaling
and aging remains elusive. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is normally kept within the
mitochondria. However, under conditions of mitochondrial stress or damage, mtDNA can be
released into the cytosol thus encountering cytosolic DNA sensors and activating pro-
inflammatory responses. Cytosolic mtDNA has been reported in the brains of AD patients and
cellular models of AD, but, whether cytosolic mtDNA can be targeted for therapeutic intervention
in AD has not been determined. Moreover, fundamental questions remain regarding the
occurrence and role of cytosolic mtDNA in aging and age-related health decline. In preliminary
work, we find that aging leads to a striking decline in mitochondrial autophagy and a concurrent
accumulation of cytosolic mtDNA, which is linked to proinflammatory signaling in different organ
systems of Drosophila including the brain. Critically, we have discovered that adult-onset,
neuron-specific silencing of EYA, a molecule involved in sensing cytosolic DNA, dampens
inflammatory signaling in the aged brain and extends lifespan. In addition, we have
developed genetic approaches to reduce cytosolic mtDNA, via increased lysosomal DNase
activity, in aged flies. These findings provide an important first step towards understanding the
mechanistic interplay between cytosolic mtDNA, immune signaling and healthspan. Here, we
propose to build upon these groundbreaking findings by exploring three broad questions: 1)
What are the mechanistic relationships between mitochondrial homeostasis, cytosolic mtDNA,
and aging? 2) Does cytosolic mtDNA and associated pro-inflammatory signaling drive aging and
age-related health decline? 3) Can modulating cytosolic mtDNA and associated pro-
inflammatory signaling counteract Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis? The work described
herein will bring about fundamental knowledge towards our understanding of the mechanisms of
aging and AD-related pathology. Our findings may also lead to novel therapeutic approaches to
counteract aging, AD and related dementias."

mutations are not understood in sufficient detail to identify points of therapeutic intervention. To identify new
therapeutic targets, we have identified two microRNAs that normalized contractility of DCM cardiomyocytes
comparable to CRISPR-correction of the underlying mutation. We biochemically identified their targets,
identifying 203 genes, of which individual siRNA-mediated inhibition of 117 restored contractility of TNNT2
mutant DCM mutant hiPSC-CMs from different patient donors.
The overarching objective of the parent R01 is to understand how the 117 miR-target genes improve DCM and
advance this information to develop novel therapeutics. The Specific Aims are to elucidate the therapeutic
mechanisms of action of these genes and to understand the selectivity of particular mechanisms for different
forms of inherited DCM (Aim 1); establish causal evidence of disease-modifying activity using human genetics
(Aim 2), and test whether a set of promising targets that are predicted to reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress will alleviate clinical symptoms of DCM in a mouse model (Aim 3).
Proposed Supplement: The proposed administrative supplement will extend the parent R01 to evaluate existing
investigational and approved drugs for repurposing based on their activities against the same processes affected
by the miR-target genes. Aim S.1 will test investigational and approved drugs for the ability to rescue the
contractile deficit characteristic of DCM using hiPSC-CMs as in the parent project. Consistent with the hypothesis
that many targets converge on ER stress, we will focus first on therapeutics that are known to alleviate ER stress
or act on related signaling processes such as WNT and anti-oxidant pathways. Preliminary studies have
already identified two drugs that normalize dysfunction in the hiPSC-CM model. Therefore, Aim S.2 will evaluate
these (plus others as they emerge from Aim S.1) in more detail by probing whether they are efficacious against
DCM caused by different gene mutations and whether they act across a range of patient genetic backgrounds.
These studies will indicate how broadly the drugs can act across patients with different forms of DCM. We will
employ a broad panel of DCM-causing mutations, including both myofilament and non-myofilament variants, as
proposed for Aim 1 of the parent R01.
These studies will be performed by Mr. Isaac Sanchez, who is an Hispanic American. Mr. Sanchez recently
earned a Bachelor’s degree and is an aspiring physician-scientist committed to a career in cardiology. Additional
training components include instruction in physiology and mentoring on career advancement to support his
planned application to MD/PhD programs by the end of the supplement support period."

EJH & Associates, LLC (dba Datastream Connexion), propose the continuing
development and operations of a Vet-LIRN portal based on a collaborative
suite of online tools called LABSuite, which includes laboratory specific
technology and functions. This is the current implementation of the Vet-LIRN
portal and has successfully facilitated Vet-LIRN needs over the previous
project period.
Capabilities include customized working groups, web-based proficiency testing
registration and management, and tools that support secure information
sharing among animal health and veterinary diagnostic stakeholders.
Collectively, the LABSuite & GovSuite combined platform tools is a sustainable
model built and operationalized for secure communication, coordination,
collaboration, education, and training among stakeholders charged with
protecting the nation's critical infrastructures such as food and agriculture. This
proposal focuses on two main objectives:
1. Advance tools that currently operate the technology needs of the
 Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-
 LIRN) laboratories’ capacity to respond to animal food/drug related
 contamination through efficient online data capture and
 management of laboratory capabilities and proficiency testing
results.
2. Facilitate secure information sharing and communication for
 enhanced animal and public health.
LABSuite tools allow professionals working in different organizations (e.g.
government, academia) to work together on essential missions and
responsibilities despite differences in authorities, objectives, and roles. This
robust platform connects the community stakeholders to a centralized online
environment and houses databases of current information related to the
mission of the Vet-LIRN to include but not limited to laboratory testing
protocols, facilities, equipment and professional expertise and contacts.
Current LABSuite Information Sharing Environments (ISEs) include the Food
Emergency Response Network (FERN- https://www.fernlab.org) and the
APHIS Laboratory Portal (https://www.nahln.org), formerly called the National
Animal Laboratory Network Portal.
The work is critical as FDA monitors the capability and performance of state,
and university animal diagnostic laboratories to respond to threats; from past
intentional melamine contamination in pet food to emerging antimicrobial
resistance of bacterial pathogens."
11075655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Motor skills that we learn early in life (e.g. talking or reaching) are essential to everyday function. Learning these
motor skills involves building a repertoire of distinct motor actions (“motor gestures”) followed by refining these
gestures. Through repeated practice, the brain integrates sensorimotor feedback to refine behavior until
consistent high levels of performance is achieved. Prior studies have used anatomical, genetic, and molecular
approaches to characterize the changes that occur during motor learning. However, since the successful
execution of motor skills rely on the precise relaying of signals from the brain to coordinate precise activations
of ensembles of muscle, a critically unsolved problem is the neurophysiological understanding of how
changes in the brain’s activity patterns enable skill learning. Thus, the overall goal of our research is to
understand how the brain’s motor activity changes during learning to enable animals to create new gestures and
finely tune each gesture to high levels of reliability and precision.
I propose to study the neural control of behavior during skill acquisition by studying birdsong, a highly quantifiable
behavior that is learned during development through imitation of an adult song “tutor”, a process for which the
neuroanatomical and behavior architecture has been well-studied and characterized. During song learning,
juvenile birds acquire new units of vocalizations (“syllables”) which are refined until high levels of acoustic
precision is reached in adulthood. My objective is to examine whether and how the neural control of song vocal
behavior changes during the process of syllable creation and refinement. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that the nervous system learns motor gestures by first creating assemblies of co-active neurons specific to
each gesture and then by refining the precisely timed spike patterns within that ensemble.
I will combine advanced electrophysiological methods with novel mathematical (information-theoretic) tools to
quantify the relationship between neural activity and behavior (“neural code”) across skill learning. I will test our
central hypothesis by examining changes in the activity patterns of individual cortical neurons across song
learning in juvenile Bengalese finches (Aim 1), and in the activity patterns across neural ensembles in the
cerebellum during the learning of reaching tasks in mice (Aim 2). These studies will reveal new insights into how
the brain implements precise patterns of activity to learn motor skills. Broadly, these results will provide a
framework for investigating how transformations in spike patterns drive learning across different species."

Given the importance of oncogenic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling for tumor cell
proliferation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we believe that EGFR inhibition remains
worthy as a strategy to be included in radiotherapy (RT) protocols for HNSCC and that further investigation of
mechanisms responsible for poor response to EGFRIs is warranted. Based on our preliminary data, we propose
that increased interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling may lead to sustained interleukin-8 (IL-8) signaling and NADPH
oxidase 2 (NOX2)-derived superoxide (O2.-) production which is associated with pro-survival signaling and an
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment leading to poor response to EGFRIs. As a result, targeting the
IL-1 signaling pathway may enhance HNSCC tumor response to EGFRIs combined with RT. The overall
hypothesis of this grant application is that NOX2 redox activity and IL-8 signaling contribute to poor long-term
anti-tumor response to EGFRIs via increased IL-1 signaling in RT-treated HNSCC tumors. Aim 1 will
determine if IL-1-mediated NOX2 redox activity is involved in poor HNSCC tumor response to RT+EGFRIs;
Aim 2 will determine if IL-1-mediated IL-8 signaling is involved in poor HNSCC tumor response to
RT+EGFRIs; and Aim 3 will determine if inhibition of IL-1 signaling would enhance HNSCC tumor response to
RT+EGFRIs. Overall, we expect that this application will highlight novel redox mechanisms associated with
poor response to EGFRIs and possibly lead to promising new therapeutic approaches for RT-treated HNSCC
patients."

The mortality rate among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains significantly elevated due to
cardiovascular complications, highlighting a critical need for innovative research focused on understanding and
mitigating cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Unlike type 2 diabetes (T2D), T1D presents a
unique trajectory of CVD progression, with persistently elevated risk factors that are not fully explained by
conventional cardiovascular risk assessments. Emerging evidence suggests that T1D's autoimmune nature
may contribute to CVD through inflammatory pathways, yet this area remains underexplored. This grant
proposal aims to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the increased CVD risk in T1D
compared to T2D and non-diabetic individuals. Leveraging an interdisciplinary team with a strong track record
of collaboration and expertise in T1D, CVD genetics, single-cell technologies, and disease modeling, we
propose a comprehensive study that builds on preliminary findings indicating distinct genetic and molecular
drivers of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will delineate the differential
immune profiles in T1D, T2D, and non-diabetic individuals by analyzing serum proteins and immune cell
characteristics. In aim 2, we will identify cellular and molecular differences in atherosclerotic plaques across
these groups, focusing on variations in plaque composition, cell-cell communication, and regulatory networks.
And in aim 3, we will validate the key regulators of atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypic changes in diabetic
states through functional experiments. The outcomes of this study are expected to provide unprecedented
insights into the immune-mediated mechanisms of CVD in T1D, leading to the identification of novel molecular
targets for therapeutic intervention. To maximize the impact of our findings, we will create a user-friendly
website to share our comprehensive -omics datasets with the broader research community, fostering further
discovery and collaboration."
11073686,"Project Summary
Obesity cultivates complex immune responses in white adipose tissue (WAT), which may contribute to the
development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, there still exists a gap in
knowledge on cellular mechanisms regulating “obesity-specific” immune responses that precludes the
development of novel immune therapies to treat obesity and related insulin resistance and T2DM. We were one
of the first to report T cells in WAT in obesity. Further studies from us and others showed that WAT conventional
T cells promote, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) protect against, insulin resistance in obesity. Nonetheless, the
mechanisms underlying WAT Treg homeostasis and mediating their metabolic benefits remain incompletely
understood. This application aims to investigate microRNA-30a (miR-30a) regulation of WAT Tregs and its
impacts on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity. This proposal builds on our novel pilot data: 1)
miR-30a expression in WAT correlated positively with insulin sensitivity in obese mice and people; 2) enforced
miR-30a expression in WAT promoted whole-body insulin sensitivity in obese mice; 3) miR-30a levels were high
in WAT Tregs in lean but reduced in obese mice; 4) enforced miR-30a expression in WAT of obese mice
increased WAT Treg numbers; 5) specific overexpression of miR-30a in Tregs increased WAT Treg numbers
and improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed high-fat diet. Therefore, we hypothesize that miR-30a in WAT
stimulates expansion of WAT Tregs and improves Treg functions to increase insulin sensitivity. We will
test this hypothesis by pursuing three aims: Aim 1 will define effects of cell (Treg vs adipocyte)-restricted miR-
30a on WAT immune response and metabolism in obesity and establish cell-specific roles of miR-30a; Aim 2
will build on our additional pilot data that miR-30a delivery in WAT suppresses STAT1 (a key inflammatory
transcription factor) and establish how miR-30a targeting of Stat1 governs WAT Treg homeostasis in obesity;
Aim 3 will build on our novel data that compared to diet high in saturated fat, diet high in unsaturated fat induces
higher levels of WAT miR-30a and Tregs in mice and examine dietary regulation of miR-30a and its role in WAT
immune response and metabolism. We will accomplish these aims using gain-of-function and loss-of-function
approaches in genetically modified animal models, cutting-edge immunophenotyping and transcriptomics, gold
standard clamp for insulin sensitivity, and other state-of-the-art tools. Upon completing these aims, we expect to
have uncovered a novel mechanism that may help develop new therapies that leverage the immune system to
treat obesity and T2DM."

More than 10 million Americans are affected by osteoporosis, and an estimated 40 million Americans are at
risk of osteoporosis from decreased bone mass. In addition to primary osteoporosis affecting post-menopausal
women and the elderly, secondary osteoporosis from conditions such as plasma cell disorders, lupus and
hyperparathyroidism also increases the risk of skeletal fractures. The spine is a prevalent site for osteoporotic
fractures resulting in substantial morbidity due to debilitating consequences such as pain and immobility.
Current diagnostic approach for osteoporosis evaluation such as dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) lack
the spatial resolution to characterize trabecular microarchitecture, a crucial marker of bone quality. Considering
the high socioeconomic burden related to skeletal fragility, there is an unmet clinical need to develop a
quantitative bone characterization technique that can comprehensively measure cortical and trabecular
microstructures in vivo.
Photon-counting detector (PCD) CT has been recently introduced for clinical use. We have demonstrated
numerous technical and clinical benefits of PCD-CT for musculoskeletal imaging. A single PCD-CT scan offers
both high spatial resolution (110 µm) and spectrally resolved x-ray data which are beneficial for characterizing
trabecular morphometry and volumetric bone density. The long-term goal of our work is to extract imaging
biomarkers of bone quality for routine assessment of skeletal fragility and guide timely initiation and monitoring
of pharmacologic therapies in patients at high risk of osteoporotic fractures. The objective of this proposal is to
demonstrate the clinical utility of PCD-CT in characterizing bone quality in the vertebrae of patients undergoing
pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis. We propose to meet this objective by first developing and validating a
quantitative spine PCD-CT imaging methodology using cadavers and compare the results to a high-resolution
reference standard (micro-CT) in Aim 1, and clinically translate the imaging methodology in Aim 2 to
demonstrate in vivo bone quantification in osteoporotic patients. The significance of our proposed technique
is that it will enable accurate characterization of bone quality on a clinically available CT system for direct or
opportunistic bone quality assessment."
11074951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The contribution of the autonomic nervous system to the development of inflammation is an important
new subject that has massive potential for clinical applications. It has been demonstrated that α7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) is a critical component of anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway that
protects an organism during infection, arthritis, diabetes and atherosclerosis. So far, the protective role of
α7nAChR was established only on the prevention of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα
and IL-6. However, the mechanism of α7nAChR contribution to inflammatory response seems to be more
comprehensive. One of the most critical steps of the inflammatory response is macrophage migration to the
site of inflammation. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanism of macrophage migration regulated
by the autonomic nervous system. We hypothesize that α7nAChR activation affects macrophage migration
during inflammation by changing the expression of cell adhesive receptors, that modifies the overall α7nAChR-
mediated anti-inflammatory response. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three Specific Aims: 1. Determine the contribution of α7nAChR to macrophage accumulation within
the site of inflammation utilizing in vivo inflammatory models. 2. Evaluate the effect of α7nAChR on
macrophage adhesion and migration using in vitro assays. 3. Define the critical molecules that regulate
α7nAChR-mediated leukocyte migration. Under the first aim, the effect of α7nAChR-deficientcy on
macrophage accumulation during endotoxemia and atherosclerosis will be evaluated. Under the second aim, the
contribution of α7nAChR to macrophage motility will be assessed using in vitro adhesion and migration assays.
Under the third aim, α7nAChR-dependent expression of adhesion and chemokine receptors on macrophages
will be evaluated and analyzed. The significance of our study resides in providing a new insight into the
function of neuro-immune synapse during inflammation. The direct contribution of α7nAChR cholinergic
receptor to monocyte/macrophage migration proposes a new mechanism for the regulation of inflammatory
response though the vagus nerve. This proposal is innovative because most studies of cholinergic anti-
inflammatory mechanisms have focused on the ability of nicotinic agonists to suppress the synthesis and release
of inflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages. We propose the role of neuro-immune synapse in
macrophage migration. The results of our studies will provide completely new information regarding the role of
α7nAChR in inflammation. These findings will be of significant therapeutic interest for targeting α7nAChR to
regulate macrophage migration and to control inflammation in several disorders. The development of anti-
inflammatory treatments is an objective of our further investigations."
11036431,"This proposal seeks to develop a novel therapeutic approach for recurrent or metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a rare and aggressive malignancy of the adrenal cortex. The current five-year survival rate for metastatic ACC is less than 15%. The proposed work will establish feasibility of a scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1) targeted nanoparticle encapsulating a ferroptosis-inducing agent. SCARB1, an integral membrane protein found in many cell types, is best known for its role in selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoproteins. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic mode of regulated cell death, has produced intriguing therapeutic responses in tumor models, exploiting tumor-related metabolic reprogramming to selectively kill tumor cells. ACC cells are highly susceptible to ferroptosis and exhibit elevated surface expression of SCARB1. Therefore, exploration of a dual-selective formulation is warranted.

Activities will be divided into three sequential aims: (1) optimizing nanoparticle encapsulation of ferroptosis-inducing agents, (2) evaluating ferroptotic potential in relevant cell lines, and (3) demonstrating tumor effect in a murine model of ACC. This project seeks to produce a formulation suitable for further development and IND-enabling studies. This novel and scientifically supported strategy could transform treatment for ACC and other tumors."

quite alarming that the options for malaria therapy are increasingly becoming limited because of widespread
drug resistance. Furthermore, most of the antimalarials act only on the erythrocytic stages, the drugs for
prophylaxis and relapse of malaria are suboptimal. To address the fragility of malaria therapy, we propose to
discover and optimize next generation antimalarials acting on underexplored Plasmodium kinases. We will
leverage wealth of knowledge on diverse chemical scaffolds and know-how related to the drug development
and tolerability of kinase inhibitor-based therapies for various human diseases. We will focus on type II kinase
inhibitors that have been designed to overcome selectivity issues by using both the ATP-binding site as well as
the adjacent hydrophobic region created by the activation loop in the inactive conformation. To the best of our
knowledge, type II inhibitors are yet to be explored as antimalarial agents. Premise for this proposal is based
on our promising preliminary screening that has identified type II compounds with therapeutic and prophylactic
activities. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that we can design effective type II chemical
scaffolds that act on multiple stages of parasite development. To achieve this goal, we propose to pursue the
following: (1) Design and synthesize optimized selective antimalarial type II compounds for in vivo application;
antiplasmodial hits will be optimized to improve potency, selectivity, and pharmacological properties through
stages of iterative analog design, synthesis, and evaluation of biological and biochemical activities. (2)
Determine rate of killing, resistance profile, stage susceptibility, and efficacy of lead compounds in murine and
humanized mouse models. Furthermore, the ability of the lead compounds to inhibit liver stage infection and
gametocyte maturation will be assessed. 3) We will identify targets of antimalarial chemotypes using in vitro
evolution of resistance followed by whole genome sequencing. We will use conditional knockdown and copy
number variation of the resistance determinants for target validation. We will conduct phosphoproteomics
analysis to uncover signaling pathways modulated by the type II inhibitors under study. The research in this
endeavor will be conducted through a multidisciplinary collaboration between the laboratories of Debopam
Chakrabarti (University of Central Florida), Nathanael Gray (Stanford University), Elizabeth Winzeler
(University of California San Diego) with combined expertise in medicinal chemistry, kinase chemical biology,
malaria cell biology, anti-infective discovery, target identification, and validation. Successful completion of
these goal will lead to the discovery of novel chemical leads with therapeutic and prophylactic potential."

Training can sharpen and refine our perceptual skills. In the auditory system, this process— termed
perceptual learning— shapes the acquisition of both native and non-native languages, and can improve
speech and music recognition in users of assisted listening devices. Previous work has highlighted important
contributions of non-sensory processes (such as attention and reward) to perceptual learning, but the
underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of
the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a prefrontal cortical region implicated in signaling reward and expectation, and
in exerting top-down control of sensory cortical processing. This project will explore the contribution of the OFC
to auditory perceptual learning in a classic model organism for auditory studies, the Mongolian gerbil. Our
overarching hypothesis, informed by previous and ongoing work, is that training on an auditory task
strengthens a descending projection from the OFC to the auditory cortex, leading to gradual improvements in
auditory cortical sensitivity that underlie perceptual learning. We propose three specific aims to test this
hypothesis. In Aim 1, we use multichannel electrophysiology and pathway-specific fiber photometry to
determine whether training on an auditory task strengthens a descending projection from the OFC to auditory
cortex by increasing presynaptic activity. In Aim 2, we combine pharmacological and optogenetic methods to
determine whether the OFC modulates auditory cortical processing and/or perception in behaving animals via
a descending monosynaptic projection, and reveal whether this capability is enhanced after perceptual
learning. Finally, in Aim 3 we determine whether optogenetic activation of auditory cortical-projecting neurons
in the OFC is sufficient for improving auditory cortical and perceptual sensitivity in behaving animals in the
absence of training. In summary, our experiments combine a powerful array of in vivo tools to dissect the
neural circuit mechanisms that support auditory perceptual learning. The importance of perceptual learning for
improving auditory skills in hearing impaired listeners, and the disruption of perceptual learning in individuals
with neurodevelopmental disorders, like dyslexia and autism, highlight an urgent need for a more complete
description of how perceptual learning is implemented in the brain."
11078034,"Several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are characterized by the spread and
aggregation of the protein tau. Recently, we identified a cellular receptor, LRP1 (Low-density lipoprotein
Receptor-related Protein 1), that regulates the tau spread pathway. Knockdown of LRP1 prevents tau spread
in human iPS neurons and the mouse brain, suggesting that the tau-LRP1 interaction could be an important
entry point for disease intervention. Unfortunately, a detailed understanding of the tau-LRP1 molecular complex
is still lacking. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to define the tau-LRP1 structural interface and
discern how post-translation modifications (PTMs) to tau’s structure influence tau uptake and spread. In
preliminary work, we have developed protocols to purify and measure interactions between tau and LRP1. We
have established cellular platforms to model tau propagation and have shown that this process can be influenced
by tau PTMs. To fully develop this work, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will use TR-FRET to establish in
vitro affinities between tau and LRP1 and mass spectrometry to map the protein-protein interface. In Aim 2, we
will look at how tau phosphorylation can influence the tau-LRP1 complex and what effect this has on tau spread
and aggregation. In Aim 3, we will focus on tau PTMs that alter lysine residues. We will assess if ubiquitination
or acetylation can impact the tau-LRP1 interaction, if they influence tau aggregation, and if they promote or inhibit
tau uptake and seeding in cells. The innovative experimental methods and comprehensive analyses outlined
herein will provide important mechanistic insight and develop our understanding of pathogenic tau regulation in
AD. This will be an essential first step forward for the development and evaluation of potential AD therapeutics."

While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the
human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior
remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities,
spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of
present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated
Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to
measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals,
we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively-
parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify
the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop
scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in
establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single-
cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical
challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological
systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to
encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in
Genomics and Systems Biology."

Mechanisms of B cell responses to particulate antigens
Two biophysical attributes shared by most animal viruses are the display of viral-specific proteins at certain
densities on the surface of individual virions and the encapsulation of viral genome inside the virion. A threshold
density of viral surface proteins is important to ensure efficient viral infection of host cells. From the perspective
of the host, a threshold density of viral surface proteins may also be critical for the recognition by germline B
cells for efficient mounting of humoral responses. The encapsulated genetic material may also stimulate B cells
through the Toll-like receptors. Substantial mechanistic studies at the single-molecule level and imaging of live
cells have revealed the sensitivity of B cells to the density of antigens. However, at the mechanistic level, it
remains largely uncharacterized how B cells may recognize and respond to the individual as well as collective
attributes of a virus, including the spatial density of proteins and the internal nucleic acids. This project aims to
unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms of B cell responses to viral features both in vivo and in vitro,
using a new generation of model particulate antigens that we have recently developed. The success of this
project will yield new and important mechanistic information on how B cells recognize particulate antigens similar
to viruses, and reveal the functional outcomes of B cells in response to the recognition of the biophysical features
of these antigens."
11072314,"Project Summary and Abstract for the SEAL (Stopping Eczema and ALlergy) Study
 Food allergy (FA) is an epidemic among children in the U.S., U.K., and other countries. There is increasing
evidence that epicutaneous allergen sensitization through a dysfunctional skin barrier results in allergic
responses whereas early consumption of food allergens induces oral tolerance, as described by the dual
allergen exposure hypothesis. In the Learning Early About Peanut LEAP and Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT)
studies, dry skin and the severity and the duration of eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD) in the 1st year of life
were predictors of peanut allergy (PA) and sensitization. In the SEAL study, we aim to intervene very early in a
high-risk infant group, as soon they have the earliest onset of dry skin or eczema in the 1st 10 weeks of life,
but before they have developed allergies. By reducing the duration and severity of eczema and preventing
eczema exacerbations, we aim to prevent epicutaneous allergen sensitization and significantly reduce the
incidence of FA. Our primary objective is to test if the combination of trilipid skin emollient use early in life with
proactive topical steroids decreases the prevalence of FA compared to controls.
 We propose a randomized (1:1), controlled trial design for infants with dry skin or eczema (n=750 total) to
compare the effect of proactive treatment against a reactive treatment group for the prevention of FA, by
reducing dry skin, and the severity and duration of eczema in early infancy. We will test our hypothesis with the
following specific aims using world-class clinical research units known for excellent recruitment and retention of
patient cohorts, mechanistic testing, and state of the art research. Specific Aim 1: To determine if proactive
versus reactive treatment will reduce the occurrence of FA in a prospective, randomized, and controlled
intervention trial of infants with eczema. Specific Aim 2: To test whether the skin of children in the proactive
treatment will show improved epithelial barrier markers with increased commensal bacteria colonization.
Specific Aim 3: To determine whether proactive treatment will be associated with protective immune
responses. If the aims are achieved, our proposal will make a clinical impact by providing a new, clinical
strategy to prevent the occurrence of FA in young infants that present with the earliest signs of dry skin or
eczema."

Options to reduce bleeding risk in persons living with hemophilia A are expanding. The issue is important
because the expense of factor concentrates, the most expensive drugs per beneficiary under Medicare Part B,

currently include i) standard half-life factor products, ii) extended half-life factor products, iii) non-factor
substitutes, and iv) gene therapy. Analyses of optimal prophylactic strategies for persons living with hemophilia
A are complicated by study heterogeneity, a result of different inclusion criteria and disease severity
categories. To date, most health economic analyses have been funded by industry. A public-facing, easilyupdatable,
transparent, and independent health economic model does not exist for treatment decisions faced
by persons living with hemophilia A. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this research is to quantify value- and
equity-informed resource allocation thresholds for subpopulations living with hemophilia A. The applicant will
achieve the proposed aims of this K01 award under the guidance of established researchers who span health
decision science, health policy, hematology, and pharmacoepidemiology. The applicant will create a publicfacing,
transparent, and independent microsimulation model to evaluate all existing prophylactic treatment
strategies for persons living with hemophilia A. He will use a combination of intermediate and advanced health
decision science and pharmacoepidemiologic methodological techniques to derive equity weight thresholds,
assess the value of collecting information with future studies, and quantify annualized bleed rates from realworld

11036428,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare, universally fatal childhood brainstem tumor, striking about 150-300
children in the US with a median survival of only 9-11 months. For 50 years, clinical trials in DIPG have been an
abject failure; however, recently GD2-CAR-T therapy has shown promise in small DIPG clinical studies.
A new paradigm for the treatment of DIPG is proposed using tumor-targeted mimics of a powerful immune stimulating
cytokine IL-12, naturally found in the body. As a therapeutic, IL-12 bridges innate and adaptive immunity in human
clinical trials but severe systemic toxicities limit the ability to achieve maximum benefit.  This proposal radically engineers IL-12 so its biological activity is conditional to binding GD2 uniquely expressed on DIPG tumors. Instead of IL-12 protein, we use high content screening of macrocyclic peptidomimetic libraries containing 10^14 compounds to create completely new compounds that mimic IL-12, bioactivity, allowing precise chemistry-based
tools to 1) conditionally activate IL-12R signaling upon GD2-binding (creating an AND gate), 2) minimize systemic
exposure via tunable pharmacokinetics and 3) increase tumor penetration by minimizing molecular weight. Finally, a

The Cloud Workspace of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) will make it easy for a
wide range of researchers to analyze data and work together. Our primary goal is to create a
user-friendly environment where researchers can import their data, analyze their data alongside
other Common Fund datasets, and use a variety of analysis tools and workflows. Our Cloud
Workspace Implementation Center (CWIC) leverages the existing partnerships between the
Texas Advanced Computing Center’s (TACC) unparalleled public high-performance resources,
Galaxy’s open-source online interface for analyzing data and authoring workflows, and
CloudBank’s tools that simplify cloud resource access and billing. By leveraging our existing
resources and skills, this CWIC can streamline implementation of the Cloud Workspace.
This Cloud Workspace will provide users with access to Common Fund datasets, allow users to
import data from other sources, and allow for data integration and analysis. Users will have
access to a wide range of tools, workflows, and pipelines developed by the CFDE, by Galaxy,
and by other partners. In addition, users will have the flexibility to use custom or third-party
tools within the workspace. The CWIC will cater to the needs of both novice and expert users by
offering outreach, training, and support designed to meet the diverse needs of its users. This
effort will include user manuals, online tutorials, and tools to help users manage computing
costs across public and commercial computing resources. Current scientific discoveries can be
expensive, relying on large datasets and intensive computational processing power. Notably,
this Cloud Workspace will enable science across a broad set of researchers, providing access
to large amounts of storage and compute at no cost to new users and trainees.
By promoting data sharing, collaboration, and ease of access, the CWIC will speed up
biomedical research and address high-priority challenges for our nation. The CFDE Cloud
Workspace represents a significant step towards realizing the vision of broadening the
community of scientists with the power to tackle complex research questions and drive
innovation."

Through supplemental work on the parent R01, this project aims to provide research training,
mentorship, and career development opportunities to build the early career of an emerging
Latina clinician-researcher and increase monolingual Spanish speaking Latinx community
participation in clinical trials for neurodevelopmental disorders. Engaging underserved
communities in clinical trials is challenging. Even when rehabilitation research is stakeholder-
informed from design to enactment, it does not always allow minority groups to access certain
studies. People of Latin American origins in the United States (US) are growing minority group,
who are at high-risk for marginalization in the healthcare system and in research. For Latinx
children and families with CP, marginalization can occur due to the intersection of socio-
demographic obstacles, language, and culture. As a result, they may experience poor health
outcomes that compound over time and further impede participation in clinical research
evaluating the acceptability and effectiveness of interventions for CP. Yet, if this challenge can
be addressed, it would significantly improve the generalizability of interventions for CP that
engage parents as active participants in research and healthcare managers for their children.
Towards this end, the current supplement evaluates the hypothesis that culturally appropriate
adaptations of motor and parenting interventions from the parent R01 will increase enrollment of
a geographically representative sample of US Latinx children with CP in the parent R01. Two
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1: Two-year enrollment of a geographically representative
sample of Latinx children with CP in the parent R01 will increase when culturally appropriate
translations and adaptation of materials are used and improve understanding of caregiver
perceptions surrounding early CP diagnosis. Aim 2: The effect of each intervention when
delivered in Spanish (appropriately adapted for cultural norms) to Latinx families will not differ
relative to English in English-speaking families matched for social determinants of health. The
data collected in the proposed supplement will improve access of US Latinx families to clinical
research interventions and inform approaches to enhance research participation in
neurodevelopmental disorder related clinical trials. The proposed supplement will also provide
insight into caregiver perceptions of early diagnosis that may inform clinical care."

In response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-CA-24-030, our research addresses the urgent
concern of escalating plastic pollution across the life course and across the cancer control continuum as an
administrative supplement to University of New Mexico Cancer Center Support Grant (P30CA118100, Current
Year 18). Despite numerous reports indicating the ubiquitous presence of plastics in the environment and
growing global concern for ecosystems and human health, plastic production and use continue to grow
unabatedly. Humans are exposed to plastic particles mainly through ingestion of contaminated food or water,
through inhalation, or through skin contact. Humans consume up to 5g (weight of a credit card) microplastics
weekly, and colonic epithelial cells will face the brunt of this contemporary modifiable exposure. Recent studies
provide evidence for the accumulation of microplastics in multiple human organs including the colon. Toxic
exposure to microplastics has been linked to the disruption of colonic epithelial cell structure and function.
Moreover, studies in different preclinical models including mice indicate that microplastics exposure leads to
various adverse intestinal effects including inflammation, barrier dysfunction, and microbial imbalance. Long-
standing intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development.
However, to date, there have been no studies investigating the influence of microplastics on colon tumor
growth and metastasis in vivo. Thus, investigation into the potential association between the environmental
microplastics exposure and the risk of CRC is merited. Our objective is to investigate the impact of
microplastics exposure across lifespan on human colons (n=64). We hypothesize that there's an increasing
trend in the uptake of plastics into human colon tissues over time, potentially impacting CRC risk. Our
hypothesis is based on our data showing that the most common microplastics in human colon tumors are
polyethylene (PE), and there is a positive correlation between microplastics concentration and patient age.
Moreover, PE and polystyrene (PS) are significantly increased in human colon tumors compared to normal
colon tissues from cadavers. The proposal integrates human relevance through archived colon tissues from
New Mexico's diverse and underprivileged population, as well as human colonoids (both normal and tumor).
This project aims to enhance our comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms underlying microplastics'
toxicity and identify actionable elements for community-level disease prevention and treatment."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) make up 69% of people living with HIV in the US. Among MSM and
gender minority individuals who have sex with men living with HIV, substance use disorders (SUDs) are
associated with inadequate engagement in HIV care, often leading to episodic unsuppressed viral load
(VL) or viral rebound, thus driving the epidemic through elevated HIV transmission risk. Behavioral
science identifies that internalized stigmas perpetuated by experienced stigma and structural inequities,
influences sub-optimal engagement in HIV care, resultant unsuppressed VL, and transmission among
MSM with SUDs. Stigma and related emotions (e.g., shame) compromise health outcomes both directly
(e.g., via sub-optimal adherence and appointment attendance) and indirectly (e.g., as barriers to social
services engagement). Interventions are needed to address stigma and shame as barriers to viral
suppression among MSM and gender minority individuals living with HIV and SUDs. To meet this need,
we developed, refined, and conducted a pilot RCT (K23DA043418) to assess the feasibility and
acceptability of the MATTER intervention, an evidence- and community- informed psychobehavioral
intervention to facilitate viral suppression by reducing the impact of internalized stigma and shame on
engagement in HIV care among MSM with SUDs. The MATTER intervention aims to mitigate the
negative behavioral consequences of internalized stigma and shame on viral suppression by a)
behavioral self-care goal setting skills and related self-efficacy, b) increasing metacognitive awareness
(i.e., non-judgmental awareness of cognitions and emotions), and c) compassionate self-restructuring
(i.e., self- compassion). It involves 5- one-on-one virtual therapy sessions and bidirectional personalized
text messaging to extend the impact of the intervention while using less interventionist time and phone-
based resource navigation. The proposed hybrid type 1 efficacy-implementation study will use the RE-
AIM framework to assess: 1) the efficacy of the MATTER intervention on viral suppression at the final
12-month follow up visit compared to a time-matched control arm using a fully powered randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N=256), 2) the proposed mechanisms of the MATTER intervention to inform future
interventions to mitigate the impact of stigma, and 3) facilitators and barriers to the reach, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance of the MATTER intervention to be conducted in two priority locations
with key differences: the Boston, Massachusetts and Miami, Florida metro areas. Should the intervention
be efficacious, and the innovative internalized stigma mitigation approach be confirmed, we will be well-
positioned to leverage the identified facilitators and barriers to implementing this intervention among
MSM and gender minority people who have sex with men living with HIV and SUDs in a subsequent
hybrid type 2 trial to assess the scalability, including a full cost-effectiveness assessment."
11078906,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The act of swallowing food and liquid is a basic human function that most people take for granted. Yet,
approximately 15% of older adults suffer from impaired swallowing which can lead to malnutrition, frailty and
pneumonia. Our previous NIH-funded research has confirmed that age-related decline in the muscles of the
pharynx (throat) is associated with negative changes to swallowing mechanics and function, putting older
adults at risk for serious health consequences. Given that exercise and nutrition are known powerful
stimulators of positive muscular change, we propose to investigate these methods to reverse age-related
decline of the pharyngeal swallowing muscles. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that proactive
swallowing exercises (+/- daily protein supplement drinks) will improve the composition, force, and physiology
of the pharyngeal muscles. Our study design begins with 12 weeks of no-treatment control, allowing each of
our 80-community dwelling older adult participants to serve as their own experimental control. Next,
participants will be randomized to complete 12 weeks of pharyngeal exercises (5 days per week) with or
without protein drinks. Before and after each phase, our study team will conduct a comprehensive battery of
outcome measures to quantify changes to the pharyngeal muscles. Specifically, we will capture pharyngeal
muscle composition with magnetic resonance imaging, pharyngeal muscle force with high resolution
manometry, and pharyngeal muscle physiology with videofluoroscopy. We expect that proactive swallowing
exercises will improve the composition, force, and physiology of the pharyngeal muscles and that these gains
will be enhanced in the +protein condition. Finally, we are motivated to identify health-related predictors of
treatment success. To that end, we will assess the influence of baseline measures of nutritional status and
physical function on treatment success by analyzing biochemical markers extracted from blood samples and
by conducting comprehensive analyses of body composition. The global population is rapidly aging and thus
many older adults will experience the debilitating impact of impaired swallowing. Therefore, research
establishing effective interventions to reverse and/or prevent age-related swallowing muscle decline is timely
and important. Building a physiologic reserve in the swallowing muscles can improve the health and quality of
life of community-dwelling older adults."

 The goal of this project is to characterize the speech perception and auditory abilities of infants, children,
and adults with Down syndrome. Prior research involving individuals who are neurotypical has highlighted the
importance of early perceptual development on long-term speech and language outcomes, but little is currently
known about the factors that support communication outcomes for individuals with Down syndrome. We do know
that the development of functional hearing skills in children who are neurotypical (such as understanding speech
when several people are talking at the same time) requires years of experience with sound, extensive language
knowledge, and maturation of executive function. These observations suggest that attainment of speech
perception and hearing milestones is likely to be delayed or disrupted for children with Down syndrome, due to
limitations in intellectual functioning, language knowledge, and cognitive processing. The first aim of this project
evaluates phoneme perception in infants, children, and adults with Down syndrome, with a focus on
characterizing infants’ discrimination of native and non-native speech contrasts and examining effects of hearing
loss on the consonant identification in children and adults. The second aim tests the hypothesis that maturation
of selective listening strategies follows a delayed time course of development for individuals with Down
syndrome, resulting in greater susceptibility to interference from competing background sounds. The third aim
characterizes the ability to recognize speech in the presence of competing background sounds in children and
adults with Down syndrome, accounting for individual differences in factors such as linguistic knowledge and
working memory. The results generated by this project are expected to inform theoretical models regarding the
development of speech perception and hearing abilities in individuals with Down syndrome, and have the
potential to provide preliminary guidance for strategies to maximize speech communication outcomes in noisy
environments such as classrooms."

Craving, the intense desire for drugs, is a pivotal cause of relapse in substance use disorders and is known to
grow during abstinence known as the incubation of craving. This phenomenon is prominent in both humans and
animals yet is measured divergently—through instrumental behavior tasks in animals and subjective
assessments in humans. This discrepancy underscores the differing cognitive factors driving craving where
animal models focus on habitual behaviors driven by striatal learning systems whereas human models assess
self-reported feelings associated with craving driven putatively by the hippocampus, a neural system associated
with reward memory. The traditional understanding of reward learning, driven by the striatum, posits that memory
for rewards should fade during abstinence, but the plethora of incubation data shows an escalation. Hippocampal
memory systems provide a mechanism by which reward memories can intensify over time via systems
consolidation processes which replay memories to transform their traces into cortical regions such as the
prefrontal cortex (PFC), another region implicated in cue-induced craving. Novel methods are needed to relate
trans-species methods of craving in a single paradigm capable of teasing apart cognitive-emotional mechanisms
that may comprise different elements of craving. F99 Phase: The proposed pre-doctoral research will utilize a
novel fMRI paradigm exploring craving in a normative human population characterizing the incubation of craving
for non-drug rewards, i.e. foods, using subjective and instrumental assessments of craving. In this way, we can
leverage idiosyncratic items that individuals have a history of naturalistic encounters and display a range of liking
and times of abstinence since last consumption. Utilizing fMRI, we will examine the mesolimbic circuitry related
to habitual elements of craving, hippocampal activation related to cue-induced craving, and prefrontal
involvement in storing memories over varying lengths of time. Additionally, through natural language processing
of reward memory narratives, we aim to construct linguistic profiles correlating subjective craving with behavioral
expressions, broadening our tools to understand craving. This will enable a multifaceted understanding of
craving, integrating instrumental and subjective dimensions. K00 Phase: This phase extends this integrated
model to study craving I will have developed in graduate school to individuals with nicotine use disorders,
investigating how craving memories differ across natural and drug rewards and their impact on craving intensity
and duration. This approach aims to delineate the complex dynamics of craving in SUDs, contributing to the
development of targeted interventions. This comprehensive exploration will advance our understanding of
craving's neurobiological underpinnings, bridging the gap between subjective experiences and observable
behaviors. The findings will have significant implications for developing effective treatments for addiction, aligning
with the applicant's long-term objective of pioneering a research lab dedicated to the cognitive neuroscience of
addiction and substance use disorders."

Hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities in the United States and understanding how the inner ear
develops and establishes proper communication with the brain will provide invaluable knowledge that can help
us generate interventions for human hearing loss. Two types of hair cells are responsible for unique cochlear
functions: inner hair cells (IHCs) receive 95% of the afferent innervation by spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs),
whereas outer hair cells (OHCs) are involved in cochlear amplification and also establish limited afferent
connections with type II SGNs. As in general nervous system development, during cochlear development, a
notable phase involves the initial abundance and subsequent pruning of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and
synapses before the onset of hearing. The pathways that mediate this pruning process are a topic of active
investigation. We propose that after excessive innervation, SGNs with functional synaptic connections are
labeled as “active” and retained, while SGNs with weak synaptic connections are labeled “inactive” and marked
for removal. Phosphatidylserine (PS) has been robustly identified throughout the literature as a prime “eat me”
signal in the context of apoptosis and increasingly within synaptic pruning and neuronal remodeling. Therefore,
the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the presentation of PS marks inactive OHC-SGN connections and
labels them for removal by a yet unknown phagocytic mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines
of evidence generated in my preliminary studies: I first showed that ATP8A2, a lipid flippase known to clear PS
from the exterior leaflet of the cell membrane, is specifically localized to OHCs and type II SGNs during the
pruning period. Furthermore, in a mouse line that expresses a hypofunctional variant of ATP8A2, which was de
novo generated and characterized in my preliminary studies, the synaptic connection between OHCs and type
II SGNs are impaired. Based on these findings, my specific hypothesis is that active OHC-SGN axes express
ATP8A2 and thus clear any presentation of PS on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane which ultimately allows
ATP8A2-expressing cells to survive. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims (SAs). In SA1, I will test
the hypothesis that ATP8A2 is necessary for proper pruning of type II SGNs, and that ATP8A2 localizes to SGNs
in an activity-dependent manner to prevent PS externalization. In SA2 I will identify the cell types that recognize
PS and explore the mechanism by which they facilitate pruning. This work will help elucidate the cellular and
molecular mediators of cochlear pruning."

Schools are one of the most common settings where youth seek mental health services, yet existing
school-based mental health interventions are often difficult to implement due to time, cost, and staffing
limitations. There is a particular need for school-based interventions that target students with mild or moderate
concerns (often called Tier 2 interventions) to address problems before they escalate and require intensive
treatment. Digital, self-administered Single Session Interventions (SSIs) are evidence-based supports that are
intentionally structured to deliver a clinically-meaningful dosage of evidence-based content within one session.
Although multiple studies have found clinical effectiveness for school-based SSIs, there have been no systemic
efforts to understand how SSIs can be practically implemented in schools as Tier 2 supports. In line with
Objective 4.2 of the NIMH Strategic Plan, which aims to “expedite adoption, sustained implementation, and
continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services” this project aims to understand how
evidence-based SSIs can be sustainably implemented in schools as Tier 2 supports, ultimately improving the
likelihood of youth accessing mental health support. This proposal serves as a critical step in furthering the PI’s
long-term goal of becoming an expert in the implementation of scalable school-based mental health
interventions and pursuing an independently funded research career. Through this project, the PI will conduct
focus groups (five groups, total n = 25-30) among community members (i.e., students, parents/caregivers,
teachers, school administrators, and school mental health providers) to assess perceived facilitators and
barriers to the effective implementation of evidence-based SSIs in schools (Aim 1). The PI will then work in
partnership with community members (n = 10-15) to co-design multi-level implementation strategies (i.e.,
student-directed, staff-directed, system-directed) for increasing uptake and promoting sustainability of
school-based SSIs (Aim 2). The proposed project is significant because it is the first to systematically
investigate the real-world implementation of SSIs in schools. The completion of this project in combination with
a training plan that consists of mentorship, coursework, and professional development activities will allow the
PI to develop expertise deploying implementation science methods in school settings (Training Aim 1),
strengthen skills in qualitative data collection and analysis (Training Aim 2), and develop expertise in Human
Centered Design for co-creation of implementation strategies (Training Aim 3). The PI will be in an ideal
training environment at Northwestern University to conduct this study and learn how to develop a robust
program of research. With the mentorship of Dr. Jessica Schleider (Sponsor), Dr. Sara Becker (Co-Sponsor),
and an expert consultant team, this study will launch the PI’s development as an independent implementation
scientist."

To capture the full effects of environmental exposures on human health outcomes, the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is expanding the focus of the Children's Health Exposure Analysis
Resource (CHEAR) to encompass health across the lifecourse: the Human Health Exposure Analysis
Resource (HHEAR). The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is applying to be the HHEAR Data Center,
providing intellectual and logistical support for the maintenance, analysis, interpretation, curation, and reuse of
data generated by HHEAR in support of extramural research projects. Since 2015, we at Mount Sinai, in
collaboration with data scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have served as the CHEAR Data Center,
supporting studies of children's environmental health research. We propose to build on our established
infrastructure, expertise, and experience as the CHEAR Data Center to provide a repository for all data and
support for statistical analysis and interpretation for investigators using the data generated within and outside
the network. The HHEAR Data Center will provide: 1) data repository and management resources; 2) data
science resources; 3) statistical consultation and analysis services; and 4) collaborative research support.
Through these efforts, we seek to ultimately maximize the potential use and impact of exposure data both
within and outside of HHEAR. Indeed, investigators who access resources provided by the HHEAR Data
Center will leverage the potential of big data to accelerate environmental health studies far beyond their
original funded goals, and potentially accomplish research that was previously thought infeasible or too costly.
The HHEAR Data Center is critical to advancing the scientific community's ability to examine the environment
on an exposome scale: the design of the Data Repository will facilitate manageable and efficient combining of
existing data sets; the availability of common vocabularies developed by the Data Science Resource will
contribute to maximizing the usable data from each study; and the Statistical Services and Analysis Resource
will ultimately apply their exposome-related analytic methods to address hypotheses on the environmental
health of pooled study populations. Further, the Data Center leadership comprises world leaders in
Environmental Epidemiology, Computer Science, Environmental Biostatistics, and Ontology, already working
together as the CHEAR Data Center, who are eager to continue and expand their efforts in service of the
HHEAR Network. Our existing Data Center will be expanded in both resources and infrastructure, including
through significant institutional support, to meet the requirements of the HHEAR Network. Thus, we at Mount
Sinai are uniquely positioned to provide a state-of-the-art Data Center for the environmental health research
community."

Over 30 million Americans have type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D), a disease with significant
effects on morbidity and mortality1 that disproportionately affects non-White adults and low-income
populations.2,3 For diabetes patients, tight glycemic control can reduce the risk of micro- and macrovascular
complications, ultimately reducing lifetime health care costs and improving longevity and quality of life.4 To
achieve tight glycemic control, patients rely on various medications and different formulations of insulin.5 List
prices for insulin more than tripled from 2007 to 2018.6 The list price is often used to determine cost sharing
amounts for patients. In 2017, an estimated one-quarter of insulin-using individuals with diabetes reported
insulin-underuse due to out-of-pocket costs.7,8 Furthermore, insulin-underuse is more common among Black
and Hispanic populations,9 a fact that raises equity concerns regarding health care access and outcomes.
State policymakers have responded to insulin affordability issues by capping insulin out-of-pocket costs.
Colorado was the first state to do so on January 1, 2020.10 Following Colorado, an additional 24 states plus
Washington, DC have passed such caps.11 These caps standardize the price patients pay for insulin and may
enable T1D and T2D patients to switch to clinically preferred products that were previously unaffordable. Yet,
capping out-of-pocket costs for insulin and not other medications to manage T2D may induce patients with
T2D to use insulin rather than more expensive medications with better cardiorenal protective effects. We
explore the market effects of insulin out-of-pocket caps through 3 aims:
• Aim 1. Measure the effect of state-level caps on insulin out-of-pocket costs on changes in the use of
 clinically preferred insulin products to treat diabetes.
• Aim 2. Measure the effect of state-level caps on insulin out-of-pocket costs on changes in the use of
 clinically preferred non-insulin products to treat type 2 diabetes.
• Aim 3. Identify key patient considerations regarding choice of treatments for managing T2D given a state-
 level cap on insulin out-of-pocket costs.
We will accomplish Aims 1 and 2 with difference-in-differences analyses using a 25% sample of claims and
enrollment data from IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for the time period of 2018-2022. We will accomplish Aim 3 using
qualitative focus groups. Aim 3 will inform interpretation of the findings from Aim 2 by, for example, providing
preliminary evidence for whether patient preferences for T2D treatment diverge from clinical recommendations
due to affordability considerations. In addition to providing specific findings in the context of an insulin out-of-
pocket cap and diabetes care, the output from this grant will provide a methodology we can apply to measure
the effects of other price ceiling policies, such as Medicare's annual out-of-pocket cap for Part D drugs."

The overall goal of the Fehl laboratory is to develop chemical biology strategies to determine the functional
impact of protein modifications during signaling processes. Specifically, cellular metabolism and stress each lead
to diverse protein modifications with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine sugar (O-GlcNAc) but no tools are currently
able to capture highly dynamic and transient O-GlcNAc events with defined time and spatial resolution. Lack of
“time and space” rigor hinders the scientific community from connecting metabolism with disease physiology,
including significantly elevated cancer risk in diabetic patients observed for malignancies like breast cancer.
In this MIRA application, we pose our strategies to address this critical gap through the development of real-time
and space molecular tools that bridge cell metabolism and cancer processes using O-GlcNAc as the keystone.
Excellent NIH-funded research has discovered over 2000 O-GlcNAc on proteins in human cells, but current tools
rely on disrupted physiology, leading to artifacts, or miss key GlcNAc-driven signaling events that occur before
global metabolic rebalancing occurs in less than an hour. We hypothesize that the key drivers of hyperglycemic
metabolism and pathology lie within the first few minutes of nutrient and signaling stimulation, which to date is
not possible to observe in living cells. Our published work in photochemistry and systems glycobiology support
our unique strategies to trigger O-GlcNAc processes in minutes, before O-GlcNAc rebalancing occurs. Our
photocaged sugar tool is able to trigger the oncogenic transcription factor NFkB movement between cytosol or
endoplasmic reticulum into the nucleus, simulating physiological events that potentially link aberrant insulin and
glucose release in diabetes with breast cancer risk. Our real time system can be used to track O-GlcNAc events
during insulin signaling for the first time during the rapid, 15-minute pulses of diseased insulin physiology.
Another tool for targeted intracellular O-GlcNAc-targeted proximity labeling is able to track O-GlcNAcylated
proteins in subcellular space, which no reported tool has the capability to specifically label in live cells. We
propose in the next 5 years to develop our “time and space” molecular tools and apply them for unique
mechanistic studies in disease biology through NFkB targeting. We actively collaborate with metabolic disease
and cancer specialists to ensure disease relevance, as well as with industrial scientists for technology
development to expand industrial awareness of O-GlcNAc biology in metabolism-driven disease pathways.
The research outputs of this proposal include molecular probes, spatiotemporal strategies, and targets to
connect cellular metabolism with signaling. Our enabling chemical strategies have the potential for broad impact
in the scientific community by establishing temporal and spatial methods to study protein modifications. Our
platforms can be extended to other PTMs and drug targets, such as sialic acid modifications that regulate the
interface of cancer metabolism and inflammation. Success will establish a lasting independent research niche."

The proposed research is relevant to public health because opioid use is prevalent in the United States and the human and
financial costs associated with tolerance and withdrawal are at crisis levels. In order to reduce opioid abuse and misuse,
our long-term goal is to determine the intracellular mechanisms to lead to these clinical problems. The objective of the
proposed research is to understand the molecular involvement of adenylyl cyclase signaling and potassium channels in the
peripheral and central nervous system during chronic opioid exposure using rodent models. A great deal of work has been
done investigating the paradoxical phenomena of hypertrophied adenylyl cyclase activity and expression that occurs
during chronic opioid exposure. The central hypothesis is that increased activity adenylyl cyclase and downstream
mediators decrease KATP channel activity, leading to neuronal depolarization and increased hypersensitivity and
spontaneous pain. The rationale of this proposal is that its completion will identify key intracellular targets of adenylyl
cyclases, including potassium channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which will help us to classify
molecules that alter neuronal excitability and may play a key role in hypersensitivity during chronic opioid exposure.
Given the history of research into adenylyl cyclase and inhibitory G-protein coupled signaling in the nervous system, it is
surprising that fundamental questions still exist as to how these molecules affect neurophysiology of pain processing. Our
first hypothesis is that overall expression of adenylyl cyclase 1 in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord increases after
chronic morphine exposure. Our second hypothesis is that upregulation of adenylyl cyclase 1, and consequently cAMP,
protein kinase A, and Epac molecules decrease KATP channel activity in vitro. Our third hypothesis is that upregulation of
KATP channel subunits in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord using intrathecal injection of adenovirus viral vectors will
improve mechanical hypersensitivity, mobility, and nerve conduction in mice after upregulated adenylyl cyclase during
chronic opioid exposure. These approaches should prove to be complementary to one another and will provide the greatest
opportunity to observe changes that occur in the nervous system after chronic opioid exposure. We plan on addressing
these hypotheses through an innovative combination of in situ hybridization, electrophysiology, and potassium flux assays
in vitro, and genetic approaches in vivo. The proposed work is important because completion of these studies will
determine if the inverse relationship between adenylyl cyclase and KATP channel functionality could ultimately underlie
and promote pain signaling seen clinically during opioid tolerance and withdrawal. KATP channels present an unutilized
and interesting target for the development of drugs to treat opioid abuse and misuse. These results will have a positive
impact because they will provide an increased knowledge and understanding of these signal transduction pathways during
opioid exposure may assist in the mission to find better alternatives to current analgesic therapies for patients."

Onshore expansion of Unconventional oil and gas development (UOGD) is considered an emerging
environmental health issue due to its disproportional proliferation in rural U.S communities and the potential
health impacts on 23 million nearby residents. However, two critical gaps in exposure assessment have
restricted previous studies from achieving rigorous and actionable evidence regarding the acute health effects
of UOGD construction stages. First, current exposure assessments were too coarse to accurately capture the
short-term variability in exposure. Due to a lack of detailed construction records, investigators had to impute
construction timelines for most wells based on questionable assumptions, which likely introduce
misclassification. Second, none of prior large-scale observational studies has quantified exposure to specific
UOGD-sourced pollutant. Investigators instead have developed various surrogates, which proxy residential
exposure with functions of auxiliary factors (e.g., distance to UOGD wells). These exposure surrogates do not
account for the different transports and fates of UOGD-sourced pollutants in ambient environment, thus cannot
indicate specific exposure pathway(s). Furthermore, causal inference, which provide a rigorous adjustment for
confounding, have not been widely used in estimating UOGD’s health effects. The objective of this proposal is
to investigate the acute health effects of UOGD constructions based on improved satellite-based exposure
assessment. In the K99 phase, I will take advantage of high-resolution images obtained by multiple recently
launched satellites, including Sentinel-1s, Sentinel-2s, and Dove satellites to automatically detect the daily
construction stage of UOGD wells (Aim 1). Multiple state-of-art causal inferential methods will be used to
estimate the acute effects of each UOGD construction stage on the risk of cause-specific hospitalization in
Medicare beneficiaries based on the new exposure assessment (Aim 2).In the R00 phase, I will develop and
validate new exposure metrics based on the daily concentrations of air pollutants near UOGD wells, which are
observed by Sentinel 5P (Aim3). Finally, I will explore the extent to which UOGD-related air pollutants mediate
any effect of UOGD construction stages (Aim4). The expected outcomes are 1) an open-source software to
detect UOGD-related activities from remote sensing images; 2) exposure metrics for UOGD-related air
pollutants; 3) acute causal health effects of UOGD construction. The exposure data will be made public
available to advance the field."

The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS; U24 CA055727; PI: Armstrong) is a multi-institutional, multi-
disciplinary collaborative research resource established to systematically evaluate long-term outcomes among
children diagnosed with cancer who survived five or more years from diagnosis. With the successful recruitment
and longitudinal follow-up of the cohort that includes survivors diagnosed and treated over three decades (1970-
1999), the CCSS is the world’s largest established open resource for survivorship research with 38,036 eligible
survivors available for investigation of late mortality, and 25,665 participants who have contributed health-related
and quality of life outcomes. The resource includes comprehensive annotation of treatment exposures, ongoing
longitudinal follow-up and an established biorepository from which genotype (single nucleotide polymorphisms
[SNP] array) and DNA sequencing of 8,380 survivors are available to investigators for identification of genetic
susceptibility for disease- and treatment- related late effects. The objective of the current supplement application
is to select survivors with an existing blood specimen to characterize clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations through targeted deep sequencing."

This Phase I STTR project aims to develop a lead candidate Tissue Adhesive Tattoos generation 2 (TAT2) ink
to overcome the significant limitations of current commercial inks for endoscopic marking. The new ink will
demonstrate excellent tissue retention (no diffusion), equivalent white-light contrast with Spot® Ex (the lead
commercial competitor), and no inflammatory potential. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the United States, as per 2023 statistics from the American Cancer Society, with an
estimated 153,020 people receiving a diagnosis of CRC, leading to 52,550 deaths from the disease. Early
identification and detection of the disease are crucial for saving lives, and more than eleven million colonoscopies
and over 6 million upper GI endoscopies are conducted in the US annually. GI tattooing is a widely used clinical
practice, and endoscopic lesion marking with tattoo ink is recommended by the US Multi-Society Task Force on
Colorectal Cancer to mark suspect regions (e.g., polyps > 1cm) with tattoo inks to facilitate identification for
longitudinal follow-up, surgery, or additional procedures at a different provider. The only FDA-approved ink,
Spot® Ex (Laborie Medical Technologies), suffers from high diffusion in tissues, which leads to poor spot
precision and localization, the generation of a fibrotic response in healthy tissues, extravasation and transmural
diffusion to other tissues, and spillage into the peritoneal space leading to peritonitis. In earlier project
development at Arizona State University (ASU), we have developed a library of TAT2 inks that demonstrate
excellent tattoo performance over the commercial tattoo ink with no systemic inflammation and toxicity over a
14-day survival study in pigs and robust shelf-life stability for up to 3 months. In this proposal, Endotat
Biotechnologies, LLC will initiate steps towards commercialization by developing an optimized, lead candidate
TAT2 ink with enhanced control over particle size (less than 0.5 polydispersity), long-term shelf stability (at least
four and up to six months), and efficient synthesis (room temperature and inert atmosphere) amenable to
eventual scale-up. Using these optimized formulations, team members at ASU will evaluate the inflammatory
response and effect on cell viability using cell-based in vitro assays and evaluate localization performance in an
ex vivo assay in fresh porcine colon tissue. The lead candidate TAT2 ink performance will be further evaluated
in live Yorkshire pigs during a long-term (6-month) survival study to performed under human clinical-equivalent
endoscopy procedure conditions at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Quantitative measures will be used to evaluate the
ability of the ink to retain tight localization, avoid systemic and local toxicity, inflammatory response and fibrosis,
and mitigate distribution and toxicity to other organs over six months. The results of this study will establish the
foundation for the scaled development and regulatory determination of highly effective TAT2 inks that will
dramatically enhance the performance of endoscopic marking, detection, and surveillance of colorectal diseases
with clear potential benefit to patient care and a strong path towards commercial success."

The cingulum bundle (CB) is a major white matter fiber system mediating connectivity of the affective network.
As mood monitoring and regulation are controlled by the affective network, the CB is often investigated in
relation to the pathophysiology and treatment interventions for mood disorders. Several efforts have attempted
to characterize the CB relative to mood disorders, however, previous approaches have overlooked
consideration of interindividual variability in local anatomy. The most common anatomical variation in the
cingulate region is the presence or absence of paracingulate sulcus (PCS) morphological pattern. Despite 70%
of the population exhibiting a distinct PCS in at least one cerebral hemisphere, and its presence inducing
known reorganization and connectivity changes in cingulate gray matter, its influence on white matter remains
unknown. Interindividual variability in paracingulate sulcus (PCS) morphology may alter local white matter
organization, specifically the cingulum bundle (CB) fiber system. Given the importance of the CB in mediating
affective network connectivity implicated in mood disorders and treatment efforts, characterization of structural
and functional implications of PCS variability is necessary. The goal of this project is to identify CB connectivity
alterations across PCS morphology and characterize ill-defined PCS-related white matter with respect to the
cingulum fiber system. I hypothesize that PCS morphology will influence CB connectivity with affective
network regions and that the PCS-related white matter, termed paracingulate white matter (pcWM), will
demonstrate affective network connectivity. I will evaluate these central hypotheses in the following two
Specific Aims. Aim 1. To use high-resolution diffusion-based probabilistic tractography to determine the impact
of PCS morphology on CB structural connectivity and characterize pcWM. Aim 2. To employ human
intracranial single pulse stimulation directed to the CB to determine the effect of PCS morphology on
electrographically-defined effective connectivity of the CB. Completion of these Aims will provide novel insight
into the relationship between white matter organization and sulcation pattern. Further, elucidating the influence
of PCS pattern on connectivity perturbation of the CB is necessary for informing and optimizing treatment
intervention for mood disorders like depression. More than 30% of patients with Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) suffer from suboptimal responses and are diagnosed with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). With
a continued lack of response to other methods, patients may undergo an invasive surgical approach called
deep brain stimulation (DBS) for depression treatment. DBS for TRD traditionally targets a confluence of white
matter paths, and despite inconsistent response, CB engagement is the primary predictor of optimal patient
response. Parsing the correspondence of PCS pattern and the connectivity of the CB may reveal a contributing
factor to response inconsistency, thereby informing neurosurgical planning and improving the capacity for
predicting treatment response in TRD for DBS."
10947181,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K23 proposal outlines a five-year research and training plan that will accelerate Dr. Max Adelman's career
as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in Candida colonization and infection in critically ill
patients. Dr. Adelman is an infectious diseases and critical care clinician whose translational research focuses
on severe infections among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), a population at high risk of infectionrelated
morbidity and mortality. These patients are particularly susceptible to infections with Candida spp.,
which are the second-leading cause of ICU-onset bloodstream infection and are associated with up to 60%
mortality. Before developing infection, patients are first ""colonized"" with Candida, and the primary site of
Candida colonization is the gut. Importantly, while gut colonization is a risk factor for Candida bloodstream
infection, there is little data on the host and Candida characteristics that predispose to gut colonization itself.
Additionally, Candida bloodstream infections are increasingly caused by multidrug-resistant species including
C. glabrata and C. auris, but whether these species consistently colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of ICU
patients has not been determined. In this proposal, Dr. Adelman will test the hypothesis that several host and
pathogen-specific factors facilitate gut colonization with Candida, which in tum affects important clinical
outcomes. In Specific Aim 1, he will (a) determine whether broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly used in the
ICU predispose to Candida colonization, (b) evaluate the impact of colonization on clinically important
outcomes using a desirability of outcomes ranking (DOOR) analysis, and (c) determine the genomic
epidemiology of gut colonizing antifungal-resistant Candida spp. In Specific Aim 2, he will examine the immune
pathology that facilitates Candida colonization in the ICU by expanding on his preliminary data linking defective
IFN-y production with colonization. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Adelman has designed a training plan that
builds on his strong clinical research background with advanced training in data science, Candida genomics,
and host-pathogen interactions. Dr. Adelman's research will be overseen by dedicated mentors from Houston
Methodist Hospital and surrounding institutions in the Texas Medical Center with complimentary expertise in
translational research, microbial genomics, Candida pathogenesis, and immune control of Candida.
Additionally, this project will leverage extensive data and sample collection from an NIH-funded P01 project of
gut bacterial colonization in ICU patients (Al152999) led by Dr. Adelman's primary mentor, Cesar A Arias, MD,
PhD. Overall, this integrated training and mentorship plan will support Dr. Adelman in his discovery of factors
that lead to Candida colonization in critically ill patients. Through the proposed award, Dr. Adelman will develop
into an independent physician-scientist with clinical infectious diseases and critical care expertise poised to
improve care for patients at high risk of Candida infection."

NOT-CA-24-015. Despite the recognition of the contribution of the immune system to cancer response to
ionizing radiation, successful translation to the clinic is lagging. We are proposing to adapt the ROBIN
mechanisms of research to enable a deep dive into the field of radiation (RT) and immunity. Representatives
from seven international academic centers already engaged in RT and immunity research have converged to
participate in a small prospective clinical trial (accrual: 25 patients in US and 25 patients in Europe), to
synergize and accelerate discovery. The setting of preoperative short course radiotherapy (SCRT) in rectal
cancer, has emerged as ideal for the scientific questions posed. SCRT is a standard treatment, preceded and
followed by colonoscopies to respectively assess tumor baseline extent and response (at the end of RT):
during each colonoscopy consenting patients can donate a tumor biopsy, as well as stool and blood (PBMC)
samples. The same set of specimens can be harvested, six weeks later at surgery, where research sampling
of lymph nodes will also be possible, within and outside the RT field. These sequential sets of tissues will
enable us to conduct cutting edge multiple “omics” approaches to study irradiated normal and cancer tissue
and the microbiome in the RT field. The PBMC analysis will allow correlation at a single cell level between RT-
induced oxidative stress, changes in immunophenotype and PBMC biology. Similarly, the ability to analyze
lymph nodes harvested inside and outside the radiation field will allow to pinpoint at the single cell level the RT
effects on each immune subpopulation. The longitudinal analysis on cancer biopsy, collected before and after
RT and at surgery, will give a snapshot on the RT-induced “omics” changes. An orthogonal radiomic study will
analyze MR images obtained before SCRT and before surgery (also standard imaging procedures in rectal
cancer) together with images obtained at CT simulation. Compliance with international regulations for data
sharing, standardization of procedures and data acquisition and harmonization of uploaded data will be
essential to this effort. Advanced bioinformatics tools will be applied through a dedicated Data Sharing and
Integrative Analysis Core, capable to deconvolute and interpret complex biological and imaging data, sorted by
utilizing NCI FireCloud workspaces. By converging experienced clinical investigators, bio-scientists and bio-
informaticians to address fundamental radiation biology questions, this ROBIN will rapidly enable
unprecedented discovery that will be shared with the ROBIN network and the scientific community at large.
Finally, since inception, ROBIN has revealed an optimal environment for cross-training and cross-fertilization of
the scientists and clinicians involved in the grant preparation and has created a robust foundation for the
proposed Cross Training Core, a novel structure to form future leaders in radiation oncology and biology, a
task each of the three P.I.s consider crucial to the future of our discipline."

The goal of this proposal is to elucidate novel mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex inhibition by two protein inhibitors,
Arpin and Coronin, as dysregulation of this system cause muscle diseases such as cardiomyopathyand underpin
the invasive nature of cancer metastasis. Although mechanisms of inhibition have been widely studied, inhibition
has remained largely unexplored due to little progress towards the classification of direct inhibitors of Arp2/3
complex. In a major breakthrough, I biochemically and structurally characterized Arpin as an inhibitor of Arp2/3
complex by providing the first structure of Arpin bound to the complex. This seminal finding provided the
necessary insights to guide biochemical experiments towards precisely describing the mechanism of inhibition.
I found that Arpin binds the complex in a similar manner to activating proteins NPFs via structurally homologous
C-termini, with distinct but important differences that ultimately classify each protein as an inhibitor or activator,
respectively. In aim 1, I will continue this line of investigation by exploring the mechanism of inhibition through a
crosslinking assay that monitors conformational changes of Arp2/3 complex that will lead to the discovery of a
novel mode of inhibition. I will also investigate how post-translational modifications on Arpin influence Arp2/3
complex binding and inhibition, also studying in parallel the uncharacterized globular domain of Arpin through
structural and cell-based studies (accomplished through collaboration). In aim 2, I will apply the skills and
knowledge learned from aim 1 to investigate the long-standing proposed inhibitor Coronin, as there exists
conflicting reports on their activity towards Arp2/3 complex. I will take a representative member of the canonical
mammalian Coronins (Coronin 1A) and test its ability to regulate Arp2/3 complex function using a wide array of
biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches. In aim 3, I will focus on the remaining and most unique
member of mammalian Coron ins, Coronin 7. Coronin 7 contains a potential Arp2/3 complex binding domain at
the C-terminus similar to NPFs and Arpin, but divergent from canonical Coronins containing a coiled-coil. If this
region interacts with Arp2/3 complex or branched actin networks is not known and is a main focus in this
proposal. Altogether, this work addresses gaps of knowledge in regard to inhibition of Arp2/3 complex, a process
that comprises half of the overall regulatory system that governs cell motility and vital intracellular processes.
The success of my aims depends mainly on my ability to executive the proposed experiments and produce pure
Coronin proteins, which I demonstrate in preliminary studies. My studies on Arpin position me to ask unique
questions on Arp2/3 complex inhibition investigated in this proposal. Accomplishment of the aims should have a
far-reaching impact, providing a shift in perspective on inhibitory mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex that will supply
information regarding how this system is disrupted in diseased states. This research will also serve to further my
training in the fields of biochemistry, physiology, and molecular biophysics."

The International Society of Exposure Science (ISES) is the premier international society devoted to bringing
the full value of exposure science to research and decision-making to improve human health and the
environment. This conference represents the most comprehensive gathering of environmental exposure
scientists and environmental health professionals from academia, government, and organizations from
around the world, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The theme of the 34th ISES Annual
Meeting is “Exposures that Impact Health in Vulnerable Populations”. The 2024 conference will focus
on new and emerging environmental health challenges for humans and the ecosystem. Environmental
exposures may affect human health and the ecosystem in complex and non-linear ways. Exposure and
health issues also vary between local, regional, and global scales. Understanding the complex nature of
environmental exposures, the health impacts, and relevant strategies and policies to improve environmental
health requires the knowledge, analytical methods, and data collection tools developed from multiple
disciplines and applied at different scales. 2024 Meeting topics include application of sensors in exposure
assessment, citizen science and community-engaged research, climate change impacts on human
exposure, COVID-19, vulnerabilities in environmental exposure and health, new and emerging environmental
exposures, exposure data to policy action and impacts of public health policy, multiple exposures and
interactions, risk communication, statistical methods in exposure science and epidemiology, and
technology/sensors among others. There will be an added focus on environmental justice and
community engaged research as it relates to the field of exposure science. The 34th ISES annual
conference will be held in Montreal, Canada from October 20 - 24 , 2024 and will continue the success of
previous meetings. The meeting offers four and half days of cross-disciplinary presentations and discussions
of new research and methods of international, national, and regional significance and facilitates the exchange
of information and ideas among exposure science and environmental health scientists from academia,
government agencies, non-profit organizations, and industry. Conference attendance is expected to be
between 500-600 participants from North America, Europe, and Asia. ISES has encouraged attendance of
students and new researchers, as well as investigators from low- and middle-income countries over the last
6 years resulting in an average of 15% increase in the number of attendees. This proposal will support the
representation of students and new researchers from underrepresented backgrounds as well as provide an
opportunity for participation of community members, hence enhancing member diversity, promoting the
global development of exposure science, and fostering collaborations and information exchange both
nationally and internationally."

11077593,"Project Summary/Abstract
Schoolteachers' voice problems are significant, not only because these problems occur so frequently but also
because they undermine education in the classroom. Research has suggested a number of associated
physiological, environmental and behavioral risk factors. However, there remains a fundamental gap in
understanding how these factors affect a teacher's vocal health over an academic year, how teachers
accommodate to the vocal demands they face, and how current occupational policies (including the financial
and attitudinal constraints of educational policy makers) impact teachers' vocal health for better or worse. The
continued presence of this gap represents a barrier to the long-term objective of proactive vocal health
education and treatment programs. The current proposal will move this effort forward by exploring how
teachers' voices are impacted by vocal risks, vocal demands, vocal accommodations, and vocal health
policies. Grounded on strong foundational work and a track record of productivity, this experienced research
team proposes 3 specific aims: [1] determine the interactions between risk factors related to the occurrence of
teacher voice problems by collating cross-sectional and longitudinal (year-long) survey data with standard
voice assessments; [2] quantify teachers' perceptual acuity of and accommodations to classroom vocal
demands that increase the risk of vocal health issues by conducting analyses in classrooms and simulated
classroom environments; and [3] investigate current and potential school-based policies to improve vocal
health by reviewing administrative responses to teachers' voice issues and quantifying the costs of both
solutions and non-interventions. The proposal is innovative in part because it [1] merges virtual reality
technologies with previously tested acoustic simulations and real-time auralization systems to replicate
classroom risk factors and interventions, eliciting “teacher voice” in controlled settings; [2] uses tools from a
unique interdisciplinary research team (i.e. Voice Science, Acoustical Engineering, Communication,
Economics, and Education) to approach a significant public health concern in an effectively innovative way;
and [3] combines reliable survey instruments (developed using focus groups) with standard clinical
assessments to accurately track how a teacher's voice changes over the course of a full academic year. While
not a clinical trial, these data are clinically significant because patterns may emerge, including when voice
problems occur, how they progress over an academic year, and why they improve or worsen. Thus, this
ambitious approach will help preserve teachers' vocal health, improve the response when problems present,
and indirectly improve the classroom learning environment. The results of this study will also provide school
administrators and other policy makers with practical and economically feasible information that can be used to
support teachers' vocal health in their districts."

The Duke CHAVD has had two major breakthroughs this year in our ability to use rhesus
macaques for the study of vaccine-induced bnAb B cell lineages. The first breakthrough was
discovering the rhesus VH gene VH1-105 as the rhesus ortholog of human VH1-46 that is used
for the VH1-46 class of CD4 mimicking, CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAbs.1 We have recently
induced rhesus macaque VH1-105 CD4 mimicking, CD4bs bnAb precursors by immunization
with the germline targeting Env, CH505M5 G458Y GNT1-.1
The second breakthrough was discovering the rhesus gene VH7-a*01 as the ortholog of
human VH7-4-1*02, the VH used by the MPER bnAbs in HVTN 133.2 In rhesus study 181, the
MPER peptide-liposome induced VH7-a*01 antibodies with the same MPER specificity and
structure as the VH7-4-1*02 DH1317.4 bnAb. Moreover, we have demonstrated boosting of the
previously primed MPER clone with an mRNA encoding the proximal and distal MPER epitopes
(called mRNA009).
Thus, in this supplement, we are requesting support for 6 NHP studies—two MPER, two CD4
binding site, and two V3 glycan bnAb immunization regimens in macaques—each designed to
answer questions that are critical to learning the optimal ways to induce bnAbs. Most of these

The overall goal of R01DA054751 (‘Recreational Marijuana Marketing and Young Adult Consumer Behavior’;
R01DA054751, MPIs: Berg, Cavazos-Rehg) is to inform regulatory efforts to minimize cannabis use among
disproportionately-impacted populations. This R01 examines the non-medical cannabis market, cannabis use,
and related perceptions in consumer segments of diverse young adults. The literature indicates that licit drug
retail marketing targets certain populations (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, SGM, young adults) as well as the
consequences of such marketing on substance use in these groups. Our research to date indicates several
issues with policy compliance (e.g., age verification), promotional strategies appealing to young people and
minorities, various health claims, and minimal health warnings. Our team has also shown the utility of identifying
young adults at high-risk for substance use and marketing exposure by using industry market segmentation
strategies. R01DA054751 addresses the following specific aims: 1) determine whether neighborhood
demography is associated with marketing and point-of-sale practices among non-medical cannabis retailers over
time, accounting for policy context; and 2) compare young adult market segments defined by age and minority
status vs. psychographics in relation to cannabis use, perceptions, access, and advertising exposure in states
with differing cannabis policy contexts (non-medical, medicinal, neither) over time. As part of this work, our team
is developing a multi-year cannabis-related policy database, with unique data on retail-related policies. This
Administrative Supplement expands upon data collection in each aim of this R01 in order to address key gaps
in the literature regarding derived psychoactive cannabis product (DPCPs), and responds to NIDA research
priorities and NOT-DA-22-003: Public Health Research on Cannabis. DPCPs have been understudies due to
their recent emergence in the US market (since the 2018 Farm Bill). For example, there is no comprehensive,
verified, and publicly-available database regarding state DPCP laws, and limited research has examined DPCP
retail/marketing or use, particularly from the perspective of legislative context. Notably, the first national estimates
of DPCP use were captured in 2023 (past-year Delta-8 THC use: 11.9% of US adults and 11.4% of 12th-graders),
indicating the need for and timeliness of research in this area. This is especially important as the under-regulated
DPCP market diversifies and expands, and as states and the 2024 Farm Bill navigate ways to address DPCPs.
In addressing the specific aims of this Administrative Supplement, we will add: 1) comprehensive data on DPCP
laws to our state cannabis law database; 2) DPCP retail audits to our planned cannabis retail audits to
characterize the DPCP retail context; and 3) an additional wave of survey data collection for a subset of young
adults in our longitudinal cohort study to assess differences in DPCP marketing exposure, DPCP perceptions,
use motives, and use outcomes, by DPCP law context. Collectively, results will provide valuable insights to inform
prevention and regulatory efforts to protect public health, particularly for young adults."
11072787,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2017-2018, we worked closely with the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop and pilot test a theory-
based, multi-level intervention targeting postpartum family planning (PPFP) supply and demand in 5
government health facilities in Kigali, the capital. This innovative PPFP intervention is known as `C4' because it
is informed by Clients, Clinic providers, Champions, and Community Health Workers. Long-acting reversible
contraceptives (LARC), the intrauterine device (PPIUD) and implant, are fundamental to PPFP programs.
LARCs are highly effective and are the only reversible methods that may be safely used in early postpartum
period by breastfeeding women. During our pilot, LARC uptake among postpartum women increased
significantly (172% for PP implant, 2,687% for PPIUD), PPFP feasibility and acceptability were high among
providers and clients, and side-effects were rare. We now propose to use an implementation science framework
to evaluate the effectiveness of different PPFP demand creation strategies and test the hypothesis that C4 is
adaptable to large-scale implementation, cost-effective, and sustainable. In a Type 2 effectiveness-
implementation hybrid study, we will evaluate facility organizational readiness prior to implementing C4 in a
clinic randomized trial in 12 high-volume health facilities in Kigali, Rwanda (Aim 1). Adaptability and
sustainability within government facilities is a critical aspect of our proposal, and the MOH and other local
stakeholders will be engaged from the outset. We expect to deliver C4 PPFP counseling to over 21,000
women/couples during the project period. We will then evaluate C4 effectiveness and implementation
processes using RE-AIM (Aim 2). We hypothesize that C4 will significantly increase the number of
stakeholders engaged, PPFP providers and promoters, couples/clients receiving information about PPFP
(reach), and LARC uptake (effectiveness) comparing intervention versus standard of care. We expect PPFP
client satisfaction will be high and side-effects will be rare. The independent effectiveness of each demand
creation strategy on LARC uptake will be estimated. We assess measures of C4 adoption, implementation, and
maintenance at the patient-, provider- and stakeholder-level to assess C4 sustainability. Finally, we will
evaluate C4 cost-effectiveness and develop a national costed implementation plan to guide Rwandan MOH
decision-making for nationwide roll-out of PPFP services (Aim 3). We hypothesize that C4 will be cost-saving
relative to standard of care. C4 represents an important contribution to the Rwanda Family Planning 2020
goals and the MOH are enthusiastic to see our successful pilot efforts expanded to a larger number of facilities
for greater and sustained impact. Our PPFP implementation model is designed to be replicable and expandable
to other countries in the region which similarly have high unmet need for PPFP."

Several FDA-approved drugs have demonstrated the ability to reduce the biological inflammatory response and
augment microelectrode recording performance in rodents. However, due to limitations of pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics, most of the agents reach the implant site in relatively low concentrations, limiting the
magnitude of effect and/or requiring frequent dosages to attain meaningful results. Additionally, in the case of
steroids and antibiotics, long-term systemic administration is contraindicated due to side effects on peripheral
systems. Leveraging a platelet-inspired drug delivery platform currently undergoing commercialization, we have
engineered a method for targeting drugs specifically to the microelectrode implantation site. Localizing the drug
to the microelectrode site will reduce the systemically administered dose, while minimizing the payload delivered
to peripheral organs, e.g., liver and kidneys. During this study, we will focus on delivering the drug,
dexamethasone (Dex), which is a potent glucocorticoid steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. While we have
demonstrated the ability to target the microelectrode with drug-loaded nanoparticles, further optimization of
dosing with Dex and characterization of chronic recordings are needed. Our objective is to establish a safe and
effective drug-delivery platform for localized therapy to improve chronic BCI performance. We hypothesize that
administration of targeted dexamethasone-loaded nanoparticles (Dex-NPs) will prevent chronic scarring and
neurodegeneration associated with improved chronic recording quality of intracortical microelectrodes and
associated motor-behavioral function. If proven effective, the platform may be further developed and
characterized to release other pharmaceutical payloads that have unique or complementary effects on the
system. Additionally since the delivery platform is being commercialized, there is increased potential for scaling
the technology to human application."
11071938,"Significance: Accounting for over 80% of COVID-19 related deaths in the United States, adults ages 65 and
older have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic more than any other age group. As a result,
they may bear a heavy psychological burden in the months and years to come. Older adults have been labeled
“vulnerable” to COVID-19 and strongly encouraged to adhere to “social distancing.” This prevention measure is
meant to mitigate the spread of the virus but has increased older adults’ risk of social isolation and loneliness,
which are two known correlates of increased morbidity and mortality in late life. Pandemic-related restrictions
have decreased older adults’ life-space mobility and negatively affected their physical and nutritional well-
being, impairing their quality of life and potentially increasing their vulnerability to poorer outcomes if exposed
to COVID-19. Research has documented a plethora of pandemic-related stressors that are common among
older adults (e.g., fear of infection, loss of loved ones, financial repercussions) and the culminating
psychological impact. Telehealth-adapted evidence-based psychological interventions are needed to address
the psychosocial and physical toll of the pandemic among older Veterans. Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT) decreases emotional suffering, improves well-being, promotes and supports healthy behavior
changes, and treats a wide range of diagnoses by increasing psychological flexibility through mindfulness,
acceptance, and values-based behaviors. Higher psychological flexibility has been associated with pandemic-
related coping and well-being. Randomized studies of ACT with older adults are few but promising, and most
research studies with this population have used a group format. While research on telehealth delivery of ACT
for older adults is limited, preliminary results indicate it is feasible and as effective as ACT delivered in person.
Specific Aim: The proposed study will pilot a 10-session telehealth Pandemic ACT group intervention (i.e.,
Pan-ACT group) with Veterans ages 65 and older who are experiencing pandemic-related emotional and
physical distress.
Methods and Procedures: Twenty-five older Veterans will be enrolled in this single-arm feasibility pilot trial.
The intervention will be delivered weekly in 90-minute sessions of groups of {four} to five Veterans. {Feasibility
and acceptability of study procedures will be measured by referred-to-enrolled rate, telehealth access and
capability, electronic data collection of outcome measures, and qualitative feedback on data collection
procedures and measures. Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be measured by attendance;
attrition; homework completion; participant ratings of the intervention’s feasibility, acceptability, and fit;
qualitative feedback; and treatment fidelity.} Preliminary responsiveness of outcomes measures will be
explored. Participants will complete measures of pandemic-related emotional and physical distress,
psychological flexibility, depression, anxiety, social connectedness, perceived health, {functional impairment},
and meaningful engagement {at baseline, posttreatment, and one-month follow-up. A brief midpoint
assessment at week 5 of the group will consist of measures of social connectedness and functional
impairment. Qualitative data will be gathered on perceived efficacy to implement intervention skills and specific
emotional or behavioral changes participants have noticed in themselves as a result of the intervention.}
Conclusion: {This proposal directly aligns with the RR&D RFA to examine COVID-19-specific rehabilitation
interventions. The telehealth Pan-ACT Group is a mental and behavioral health rehabilitation intervention that
focuses on helping older Veterans develop or recover coping skills that were lost or are no longer effective
during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.} The proposed study leverages the investigators’ strengths and
expertise to address a major research and clinical gap, gather new knowledge for an urgent need, and inform
the development of a full-scale randomized controlled trial to evaluate the intervention’s effectiveness."

 Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common and progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorders in
the US with more than 5 million people currently living with Alzheimer's disease. A critical gap in knowledge is
how vascular brain perfusion dynamics are involved in vascular dementia. This emerging and difficult area of
inquiry has limited investigations into the neurovascular system, brain emergent networks, with only indirect
applications related to neurological diseases, where the functional role of protein arginine methyltransferases as
they relate to brain metabolism, circulation, functional learning and memory are understudied. Here, we seek to
investigate protein arginine methyltransferase 4 as an important age and sex-related brain regulatory element to
delay vascular cognitive impairment disorders. We recently discovered protein arginine methyltransferase 4 was
enhanced in the AD brain in mice and humans. Our central hypothesis is the inhibition of protein arginine
methyltransferase 4 via photobiomodulation, a non-invasive therapeutic (808 nm, 35 mW/cm2), can enhance
neurovascular coupling, maintain blood-brain-barrier integrity, and attenuate learning/memory deficits in aged
3xTg-AD mice. Therefore, inhibition of PRMT4 in the AD brain can revive microvessel perfusion and
hypoperfusion-mediated AD. This is a multi-PI proposal garnering the strengths of Dr. Kevin Lin, a protein
arginine methyltransferase expert in cerebral vascular brain perfusion (via two-photon laser scanning
microscopy) in various disease states such as AD and stroke/ischemia, and Dr. Quanguang Zhang, an expert in
functional behavior outcomes related to AD/ADRD with strengths in photobiomodulation as a clinically relevant
therapy."
11057403,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), traumatic experiences encountered during early life stages, can
profoundly impact health and well-being into adulthood. ACE prevalence is high, with one in three children having
at least one ACE. Children belonging to racial or ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by ACEs.
Several health issues in children are strongly associated with ACEs, including asthma, sleep disturbances,
infection risk, obesity, and behavioral issues. Additionally, children with multiple ACEs are at high risk of dental
caries and untreated oral health care needs, even those with access to preventive dental care. The objective of
this study is to investigate the possible biological factors underlying ACE-associated dental caries, with the
overall goal of mitigating caries disparity in children with early-life adversity.
 ACEs function as biological stressors that affect neuroendocrine–immune (NEI) system responses. Recently,
the brain–gut–microbiome axis, describing the bidirectional, biochemical interactions of the gut microbiome with
the NEI system, was identified as a potential root cause of ACE-associated health conditions. Dental caries is a
diet- and host factor–dependent disease in which a dysbiotic oral microbiome generates an acidic environment,
leading to enamel demineralization. Our published work identified 10 salivary immunological markers that co-
occur with caries-associated bacterial species and are significantly elevated in children with caries compared
with caries-free children. Some of these markers are also elevated in children with ACEs. We propose the
existence of a brain–oral microbiome axis, supported by multiple reports describing the salivary induction of
NEI stress response markers that may alter the oral microbiome. We hypothesize that children with ACEs present
with oral microbiome dysbiosis, increased dental caries, and immune dysregulation, including alterations in
salivary stress or immunological molecules. This study aims to examine the associations among ACEs, the oral
microbiome, dental caries, and salivary stress and immunological biomarkers in children. The innovative study
design includes (1) strategies for enrolling a clinically meaningful, sex-balanced study population with an ACE
prevalence that resembles the national average; (2) a comprehensive investigation of salivary markers, the oral
microbiome, actual caries experiences, and covariate factors; and (3) a high-resolution metagenomics oral
microbiome investigation. Study findings will contribute to understanding ACE-associated dental caries by
identifying potential causative mechanisms at the oral microbiome level. The knowledge generated by this study
has the potential to directly impact the clinical management of children with ACEs, promoting medical–dental
integrated and trauma-informed approaches to ACE identification and caries prevention. Future policies may
benefit from considering the contributions of childhood adversity to the oral microbiome and immune responses,
facilitating the targeting of limited resources and relevant interventions for children with the greatest needs."

To meet this need, the Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) provide NHP resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention modalities. The SVEU program will provide NIAID the ability to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines using NHP models in which thorough evaluations of systemic and mucosal immune responses can be conducted, vaccine efficacy can easily be tested, correlates of reduced risk of virus acquisition can be identified, and approaches to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of clinical vaccines can be conducted. The SVEUs will provide a responsive, flexible vaccine resource that is available to NIH-supported researchers and can support all stages of AIDS vaccine research, from preclinical evaluation or clinical testing of candidate AIDS vaccines, with the objective of identifying a vaccine that will generate immune responses able to prevent or control viral infection.

The scope of the SVEUs includes housing and maintenance of NHPs, the conduct of studies supporting AIDS prevention research, with an emphasis on AIDS vaccines, support of a NHP breeding colony, and general administration and management of these activities."

We intend to devise a novel therapeutic strategy based on a specific cancer cell receptor named EphA2, which
is abundant on the surface of metastatic pancreatic cancers. Over the past several years our studies focused on
testing the anti-cancer potential of agents targeting the receptor in suppressing cell migration and invasion in
cellular studies, as well as in inhibiting tumor metastases using in vivo models. Very recently we have derived
the most effective agonistic agent reported to date that potently targets the EphA2 receptor and causes its
degradation. In preliminary studies, the agent is remarkably effective in inhibiting pancreatic cancer cell
migration. The agent also causes the internalization of the receptor; hence we intend to probe whether we can
use this agent also to deliver chemotherapy selectively to pancreatic tumors."

The Pacific Southwest Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Diseases (PacVec) offers an opportunity to address an
urgent and compelling public health challenge—the ongoing rise in vector-borne diseases, particularly those
transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks—by leveraging the resources of seven leading research and teaching
institutions that have well-established partnerships with a strong cadre of mosquito control and public health
agencies around our region. Vector-borne diseases have been increasing in prevalence in the U.S., emerging at a
frequency higher than that of other infectious diseases. The impact of this trend is keenly felt in the Pacific Southwest
and our US-affiliated Pacific Islands, with our large and diverse population and our position as a global hub for travel
and commerce. Many of our public-health and vector-control partners are also national leaders in terms of expertise
and resources to combat vector-borne diseases, and PacVec presents an excellent opportunity for knowledge
exchange and capacity strengthening through sharing of knowledge across our community of practice and through
collaboration with other CoEs.
PacVec seeks to build on our successful efforts of the last five years to continue to expand local communities of
practice throughout the Pacific Southwest and US-affiliated Pacific Islands. We plan to conduct a wide range of
research projects to rigorously evaluate both new and existing methods to prevent tick- and mosquito-borne
diseases, and to engage and train a culturally diverse workforce reflective of the racial and ethnic diversity of the
region and knowledgeable in their respective fields (e.g. public health, vector control, entomology). Our plans have
been developed through constant engagement between PacVec’s Leadership Team and our public health and vector
control partners throughout the region to address our most pressing vector-borne disease needs."

high quality clinical trials of emerging therapeutics based upon testable mechanistic hypotheses.
The ITN is structured in order to interrogate different diseases across the immunologic
spectrum, with integration of innovative clinical studies and cutting edge immunology laboratory
analysis. The ITN approach—clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while we
simultaneously evaluate the cellular, genetic, and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how
they are altered in response to therapy—creates a framework for advancing cross-disease and
cross-discipline knowledge, all designed to accelerate therapeutic options for major diseases.
The existing scientific and operational framework enables the ITN to successfully enhance the
development of tolerance therapies in transplantation, autoimmunity, and allergy. ITN has
outlined a process to evolve our current strategies into the next generation of planned trials, as
well as to operate a nimble, future-focused organization, poised to lead and adopt innovations
that are currently unknown. The ITN has a collaborative structure involving hundreds of
investigators, advisors, and clinical sites working in tandem with a core group of ITN staff,
operating a program that is both scientifically and financially efficient. Several new innovations
recently adopted by the ITN encourage widespread involvement from academic investigators,
including expanded resource sharing and data sharing operations. With lead institutional
commitment from the Benaroya Research Institute and the University of California San
Francisco, and participation of more than 20 other major institutions represented in leadership
and major advisory roles, the ITN strives to continue to successfully pioneer high impact clinical

11072290,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health concern with implications for both human and animal
health. Worldwide deaths attributed to AMR are predicted to rise to potentially 10 million people annually by
2050. The actions and policies taken to combat the emergence of AMR and prevent the inappropriate use of
antimicrobial drugs are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship (AMS). Most efforts to characterize AMR
and develop AMS strategies have been focused on bacterial pathogens in people; however, resistance to
antimicrobial drugs has also emerged among other microbial pathogens including viruses and fungi. Antifungal
use and resistance likely play a role in veterinary antimicrobial stewardship but there is a paucity of information,
despite the increase of resistant fungi as a public health threat. The first goal of the proposed work is to develop
and implement an online survey of companion animal veterinarians working in both general and specialty/referral
animal hospitals. The survey will assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of veterinarians on the
following: a) emergence of antifungal resistance, b) risk factors for infection and colonization with fungi, c)
diagnosis of fungal infections and current state of antifungal susceptibility testing in veterinary medicine, and d)
antifungal drug prescribing and stewardship in companion animal medicine. We will also assess whether
antifungal resistant organisms or infections are common among animals by collecting important data on carriage
and antifungal resistance rates of Candida sp. in dogs and evaluating clinical outcomes of dogs prescribed
antifungal drugs. Enrolled dogs will have samples collected from multiple anatomic sites and cultured for Candida
yeasts, and confirmed isolates will have antifungal susceptibility testing performed. Additionally, dogs prescribed
antifungal drugs for fungal otitis externa and dermatitis will be analyzed at follow-up visits to establish rates of
clinical, cytologic, and culture resolution for both clinical syndromes. This proposal is highly relevant to current
One Health and antimicrobial stewardship efforts and priorities of the FDA. Data will have implications for efforts
focused on raising awareness of antifungal use and resistance among veterinary practitioners, developing
educational tools to improve antimicrobial stewardship programs, and informing design of future research
studies. The proposed work will lay the groundwork to prevent the spread of antifungal resistant organisms
among companion animals and to the people who work and live with them."

 Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogenic species. A few reports in the literature
describe three or four genomic islands encoding potential double-stranded phage genomes, and only one
manuscript reports the production of a double-stranded phage. However, there are issues with the rigor of that
report. We have also published that sublethal hydrogen peroxide treatment induces the expression of some
genes carried in these phage islands (Quillin, et al.-2018). Moreover, two saturating transposon screens failed
to isolate transposon insertions in some phage island genes (Hu, et al.-2020, Remmele, et al.-2014). We have
developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for N. gonorrhoeae (Geslewitz, et al.-2024) and have
used it to show that repression of two of the three phage-island encoded LexA orthologs is lethal. Down-
regulation of one ortholog by CRISPRi results in the production of phage particles as assayed by transmission
electron microscopy. We will determine whether one or more phage islands can produce phage, explore
whether the two essential LexA orthologs are regulated similarly to the canonical LexA, and determine whether
these phage(s) can infect Neisseria strains or species."
11078443,"Project summary
During transcription, the nascent RNA can anneal with the template DNA strand behind the advancing RNA
polymerase and cause the formation of alternative DNA structures called R-loops. R-loop profiling studies have
revealed that these structures are prevalent in all genomes and form normally and dynamically. Under normal
conditions, R-loops serve important physiological roles. Yet, over the last decade, harmful R-loops that arise
when transcription is perturbed have been implicated as powerful triggers of genome instability from yeast to
humans. Harmful R-loops have also been linked to an increasing number of human disorders. What
distinguishes “good” R-loops from “harmful” R-loops remains mostly unknown. In this proposal, we aim to
dissect the mechanisms linking perturbed transcription, R-loop metabolism, and genome instability. This will be
accomplished by addressing three central questions. (1) What defines harmful R-loops? While harmful R-loops
have been proposed in many studies, they have never been directly defined at the genomic level. We will
leverage our unique expertise in R-loop profiling to characterize these proposed structures in the context of
well-defined human cellular models of RNA processing dysfunction. This work will define the diversity of
altered R-loop landscapes that result from defects in RNA splicing, termination, and export and will allow us to
identify how perturbed transcription results in altered R-loop distributions, boosting our knowledge of R-loop
biogenesis pathways. (2) Does genome instability result from harmful R-loops or from altered transcription
itself? While attention has been focused on harmful R-loops, the negative impacts of defective RNA processing
on transcription itself have seldom been considered. To disentangle possible R-loop effects from pure
transcriptional effects, we will carefully monitor transcriptional perturbations in cellular models of RNA
processing dysfunction. In addition, we will directly measure the accumulation of DNA damage markers in
relation to R-loops, allowing us to determine for the first time if altered R-loops are actually “harmful” or if they
simply reflect abnormal transcription. (3) What is the role of Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) in R-loop
metabolism? RNase H1 has a clear biochemical ability to resolve R-loops and its over-expression in cells
suppresses a variety of genome instability phenotypes attributed to harmful R-loops. Yet, little direct evidence
exists to show that cellular RNase H1 expression resolves nuclear R-loops. Furthermore, recent studies and
our preliminary data suggest that RNase H1 could instead work by mitigating the impact of altered transcription
itself. To address these two possibilities, we will develop cellular models of RNase H1 depletion and over-
expression in mammalian cells and conduct a broad characterization of the resulting genomic R-loop patterns
and transcriptional effects. Our work will resolve crucial knowledge gaps concerning the formation and roles of
putative harmful R-loops in genome instability in human cells. The function and targets of nuclear RNase H1
will also be clarified, possibly revealing this enzyme in a fundamentally new light. We expect that this work will
durably impact the field of genome maintenance and provide insights into a range of human disorders
characterized by genome instability and RNA processing dysfunction."

Viral fusion proteins are fascinating protein folding machineries capable of adopting completely different
conformations during the fusion process; they are also important vaccine and therapeutic targets. Previous
studies have revealed both pre- and post-fusion conformations of the soluble fragments of many viral fusion
proteins, but less is known for structures of their fusion peptide, transmembrane (TM) and membrane-proximal
regions in the context of lipid bilayers. We hypothesize that membrane-interacting regions of other fusion proteins
related to HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) adopt defined oligomeric structures that are critical for the stability,
function and antigenicity of the full-length proteins in membrane. We have previously determined the structures
of the TM, membrane proximal external region, and cytoplasmic tail of HIV-1 Env in bicelles that mimic lipid
bilayers using the latest NMR technology. We find that these regions all form well-ordered trimeric clusters and
are conformationally coupled, and that disrupting them can reduce fusion and alter the antigenic structure of the
entire Env. In the current project, we propose to apply our NMR/bicelle technology to investigate the membrane
regions of SIV Env and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), and to use cryo-electron microscopy to
determine structures of the full-length proteins reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. We will define roles in membrane
fusion of critical structural elements of these regions by deep mutagenesis and functional assays. We will pursue
the following specific aims: 1) we will investigate the membrane-interacting components of SIV Env; 2) we will
investigate the membrane-interacting components in the postfusion arrangement; 3) we will determine structures
of the full-length SIV Env and SARS-CoV-2 S in the context of membrane; 4) we will elucidate roles of the
membrane-interacting domains of HIV/SIV Env and SARS-CoV-2 S in their stability, function and antigenicity."
11078956,"HIV-1 Env immunogens that target unmutated common ancestor antibodies (UCAs) of broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bnAbs) reactive with multiple HIV-1 envelope epitopes
Current efforts at HIV vaccine development are targeted at devising sequential vaccination regimens that are intended to
mimic the antigenic diversity of the HIV-1 Envelope (Env) as it co-evolves in response to the humoral immune system.1, 2
Sequential vaccination strategies are predicated on the existence of individual envelope immunogens that are capable of
first engaging broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) precursors called unmutated common ancestors (UCAs). UCA-
targeting Envs are designed to stimulate a particular class of bnAb precursor to proliferate and develop into a bnAb.1
BnAb precursors can be difficult to stimulate via vaccination due to their low frequency within the human B cell repertoire.1
Recently, progress has been made demonstrating proof of concept of UCA or germline-targeting of individual bnAb B cell
lineages.1 Specifically, germline targeting Envs have been developed for single bnAb B cell lineages targeting either the
HIV Env CD4 binding site, the V3-glycan bnAb Env site, the V2 apex bnAb Env site, the fusion peptide or the membrane
proximal external region (MPER) Env proximal site (reviewed in 1). However, an effective HIV vaccine will need to target
most of these sites simultaneously to escape of transmitted/founder (TF) viruses that initiate infection. Thus, the overall
goal of this supplement is to design a single priming immunogen that can effectively induce bnAb precursors targeting the
V3-glycan, the CD4bs, the V2 apex, and the proximal and distal MPER. Here, we propose to develop a single universal
priming immunogen that can simultaneously initiate multiple B cell clonal lineages against multiple bnAb-antigenic sites,
thereby both simplifying HIV vaccine design, and improving the probability of inducing rare bnAb precursors bnAb B cell
lineages for which precursors of individual B cell lineages are extremely rare.1"

11075633,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Botulism is a serious paralytic disease that affects both humans and animals which is caused by botulinum
toxins (BoNTs). Animal botulism outbreaks in farm animals, in particular, not only affects animals but also
result in financial losses for the industry and increases the risk of human exposure to BoNTs through animal
products such as milk. To prepare for a response to the future outbreaks, a fast, sensitive, and reliable
detection method for BoNTs is needed. The Endopep-MS method is one of the most promising methods that
has been used for confirmation of human botulism by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
for years. However, a comprehensive validation study of the Endopep-MS for animal specimens and feed is
lacking, and none of the veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the US have standard procedures for performing
this method. To fill the knowleage gap, our team at the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory
(CAHFS), a founding member of VET-LIRN, is proposing a comprehensive validation study of the Endopep-MS
for qualitative detection of BoNT/A, /C, /CD, /D, and /DC in animal specimens and feed. Our study has three
specific aims as follows.
Specific Aim #1: To validate the Endopep-MS for qualitative detection of BoNT/A, /C, /CD, /D, and /DC
in animal specimens and feed. We will validate and compare the developed method to the standard mouse
bioassay (MBA) using toxin-spiked samples and archived samples collected during natural botulism cases.
The sample matrices include but are not limited to animal sera, liver, gastrointestinal contents, and feed.
Specific Aim #2: To develop monoclonal antibodies for the toxin extraction step in the Endopep-MS
method. Monoclonal antibodies are key for the Endopep-MS to achieve selectivity toward BoNT serotypes in
samples. Since there is currently only one source of the monoclonal antibodies in the US, we will collaborate
with Dr. Christina Tam at United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and develop new monoclonal
antibodies for the method.
Specific Aim #3: To assess the effectiveness of polyclonal antibodies for the toxin extraction step in
the Endopep-MS method. The limited source of monoclonal antibodies can delay research development and
adoption of this method, an issue we have experienced ourselves. Alternately, polyclonal antibodies are
commercially available but the ability of polyclonal antibodies for BoNTs extraction has not been completely
explored. We will complete this knowledge gap by investigating capability of polyclonal antibodies for
extraction of BoNT/C, /CD, /D, and /DC.
If this project is funded and achieved, the lethal and time-consuming MBA that has been performed at CAHFS
for close to 30 years can be avoided. Our laboratory, as part of the Vet-LIRN, will have the Endopep-MS ready
to support botulism testing during outbreaks and large-scale animal feed emergency events."

Starlight Cardiovascular is developing what will be the first FDA approved percutaneous flow restrictor to replace
surgical banding in congenital heart disease (CHD). Many babies with CHDs such as Hypoplastic Left Heart
Syndrome and communicating heart defects have overcirculation to the lower-resistance pulmonary bed and
undercirculation to the rest of the body. Reducing pulmonary artery flow in these babies creates a more
physiologic balance between pulmonary and systemic circulations and allows them to survive the first few weeks
of life, reduces damage to their pulmonary arteries, and enables them to grow larger and stronger prior to their
next, more invasive surgery to repair their heart defect.
Currently, the reduction of pulmonary blood flow in these neonatal patients is achieved by surgical pulmonary
artery banding, but banding requires an open-chest surgery and can interfere with pulmonary artery growth, thus
limiting its clinical utility. A percutaneous solution could eliminate an open chest surgery for a newborn. Pediatric
interventional cardiologists have so much interest in overcoming the negative effects of banding that they are
perforating vascular plugs to create hand-made percutaneous pulmonary flow restrictors, and early clinical use
of these devices have produced promising results. However, use of these modified vascular plugs is limited by
technical challenges such as long implant lengths, device migration, and lack of adjustability and reliability.
Additionally, many clinicians are uncomfortable with modifying an occluder by hand and using it off-label.
Starlight Cardiovascular is developing a catheter-delivered, percutaneous, and adjustable branch pulmonary
artery blood flow restrictor to replace surgical banding. Our device addresses the shortcomings from previous
attempts at a percutaneous flow restrictor by providing reliable flow reduction, percutaneous adjustability, and a
short and well-anchored implant design that is removable. These pulmonary flow restrictors could benefit as
many as 130,000 babies born each year with CHDs including Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, Ventricular
Septal Defects, and Truncus Arteriosus.
This Phase II SBIR grant will consist of device design optimization through design iteration, benchtop testing,
end-user simulated use testing by pediatric interventional cardiologists, and acute and chronic animal studies.
Successful completion of this project will produce a final device design that is ready for formal Verification and
Validation testing, clinical studies, FDA approval, and commercialization."

Oral cancer is a significant public health problem, as 58,450 new cases and 12,230 deaths occur annually. in
the United States. Despite treatment advances, the overall survival rates (60% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years) for
oral cancers have not appreciably changed over the past 30 years. Therefore, new and effective oral cancer
chemoprevention and treatment strategies are needed. Although synthetic glucocorticoids are routinely used as
adjuvant therapy in postoperative oral cancer patients, recent evidence indicates that glucocorticoids may
actually promote tumor progression in some cases, thereby challenging the use of these compounds in patients
with premalignant and malignant oral disease. Since glucocorticoid biosynthesis and regulation can occur in the
oral mucosa, it is essential that we clearly understand the role of the oral glucocorticoid system on oral cancer
development and metastasis. Further, we recently identified a potent cancer chemopreventive agent, gallic acid,
which modulates glucocorticoid metabolism, but specific mechanisms associated with gallic acid mediated
regulation of glucocorticoid metabolism during oral cancer chemoprevention is currently unknown. In this
proposal, we propose to determine the mechanistic role of the oral glucocorticoid system on oral cancer
development and metastasis and determine the effects of the chemopreventive agent gallic acid on the
glucocorticoid metabolic pathway during oral cancer chemoprevention. We will use oral cancer cell lines, animal
models and oral cancer clinical samples to determine these effects. Our hypothesis is that downregulation of the
glucocorticoid inactivating enzyme, Hsd11b2, promotes active glucocorticoid signaling in the oral mucosa, which
promotes cancer, and inhibition of this pathway by gallic acid can prevent oral cancer development and
metastasis. Studies in aim 1 will define the impact of glucocorticoids and Hsd11b2 on oral cancer development
and metastasis. We will use genetically modified mice, cell lines and patient samples, to determine how
glucocorticoid metabolism affects oral carcinogenesis. Studies in aim 2 will determine the effect of glucocorticoid
signaling on tumor cells and tumor infiltrating T cells during oral carcinogenesis. We will use genetically modified
mice targeting the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 on oral cancer cells and T cells for these studies. Studies in aim
3 will determine the effect of gallic acid on oral glucocorticoid metabolism during oral cancer, and how the
regulation of glucocorticoid metabolism by gallic acid affects oral cancer outcomes. The complementary
expertise of our investigative team coupled with novel experimental approaches will facilitate the successful
completion of the aims proposed in this application. These studies will increase our understanding of how the
oral glucocorticoid system affects oral carcinogenesis and the mechanisms of gallic acid mediated inhibition of
oral cancer. Our studies also have the potential to change the current clinical practice of using synthetic
glucocorticoids in oral cancer management."

Background: De nova haplotype-resolved genome assembly not only plays a critical role in the studies of novel species,
but also is the most comprehensive solution to discover structural variants and understand repeat-rich regions of the human
genome. Moreover, haplotype-resolved assemblies are the fundamental infrastructures for various pangenome references.
Recent advances in accurate long-read sequencing technologies open the opportunity to faithfully build high-quality haplotyperesolved
assemblies, but most assembly algorithms could not take full advantage of the emerging accurate long-read data.
To this end, I have developed a graph-based haplotype-resolved genome assembly algorithm, called hifiasm, which combines
accurate long reads with the additional data providing long-range phasing information. Hifiasm has been widely used by
multiple large-scale sequencing projects, such as the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), the Genome in a
Bottle (GIAB), the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), and the Darwin Tree of Life project. Based on hifiasm, this proposal
focuses on developing a set of new haplotype-resolved assembly algorithms to further improve the assembly quality for
complex regions and genomes, as well as substantially reduce the assembly cost.
Research: My first aim is to develop a hybrid algorithm to produce high-quality haplotype-resolved assemblies for diploid
genomes, especially focusing on resolving highly repetitive regions like centromeres. The proposed algorithm will combine
the advantages of length and accuracy from different types of long-read data to automatically reconstruct the last unexplored
repeat-rich regions of the genome. In the second aim, I will develop a haplotype-aware scaffolding algorithm to achieve
chromosome-level haplotype-resolved assemblies for diploid genomes. In the third aim, I will propose different strategies to
reduce the sequencing cost and the computational cost of the haplotype-resolved assembly, making it feasible for populationscale
studies. I will also develop assembly algorithms to resolve complex genomes including not only two haplotypes. Upon
completion, the proposed studies will offer efficient assembly tools for large-scale sequencing projects, and will pave the way
to personal genome assembly for genomic research and clinical applications.
Career development and training: My long-term career goal is to lead an independent research group focusing on
developing novel computational methods for haplotype-resolved assemblies and the relevant applications. In addition to
further enhancing my training in computational method development with my mentor Dr. Heng Li, I will obtain systematic
training in biomedical research from the advisory committee (Dr. Erich D. Jarvis and Dr. Scott V. Edwards for human and
non-human genomes, Dr. Evan E. Eichler and Dr. Karen H. Miga for repeats and structural variations, as well as Dr. Matthew
Meyerson for complex genomes including not only two haplotypes). The training in career development, including laboratory
management, grant-writing and leadership, will also be carried out during the K99 phase. My experience in computational

The All of Us Research Program is a landmark longitudinal cohort study that aims to enroll 1
million or more participants reflecting the diversity of the United States and create a unique
biomedical data resource that can equitably advance precision medicine and improve health. Since
2016, the All of Us New England Consortium (AoUNE) has contributed to the success of the
national program by engaging and enrolling individuals in Eastern Massachusetts through a
collaboration of Mass General Brigham (MGB), New England's largest regional health system,
and Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net hospital in the Northeast. In the process,
we have designed and implemented robust procedures for staff onboarding and training, site
activation, recruitment, internal and external engagement, participant enrollment and retention,
data transfer and biospecimen collection. To date, we have enrolled more than 35,000 Core
participants of whom more than 73% come from communities underrepresented in biomedical
research (UBR) and retained our participant partners (PPs) through both passive (87%) and active
( 40%) retention activities. We have also contributed to the national All of Us program through
participation and leadership roles in multiple national committees and task forces responsible for
the program's governance, scientific roadmap, and data collection operations.
We now propose to leverage this experience to redesign and expand the reach of AoUNE to
provide enrollment, engagement, and retention opportunities to additional components of our
current consortium and additional geographical regions of New England: Maine, (which has the
most rural population and the oldest median age of any U.S. state) and Rhode Island (which
includes a range of diverse communities in terms of race/ethnicity and income). To accomplish
this, we have formed partnerships with three new regional medical center (RMC) partners:
MaineHealth, an integrated health system serving 12 counties in Maine and New Hampshire, and
with two Rhode Island RMCs (Lifespan Health System/Rhode Island Hospital and the Care New
England Health System, affiliated with Brown University Center for Primary Care and
Prevention). These new partners have extensive experience in community engagement and cohort
research.
Our proposal has three major aims. First, we will expand the AoUNE consortium to include six
new sites across Maine and Rhode Island, enhancing UBR participation, including those from rural
geography, racial/ethnic minorities, low income, and low education. Second, we will conduct
internal and external engagement activities across the full AoUNE with an emphasis on reaching
UBR populations and providing bidirectional value. Third, we will engage and fully enroll 19,000
new diverse participant partners over 5 years (75% UBR and 48% from racial/ethnic minority
communities by year 5) and actively retain 40% (and 90% through passive retention). We will
also facilitate anticipated components of the All of Us Research Program including participant
reassessments and pediatric enrollment.
These aims represent an important re-design, renewal, and expansion of All of Us New England
that will allow us to i) substantially expand our geographic reach for enrollment and engagement;
ii) increase our engagement of UBR participant partners, and iii) enhance our contributions to the
diversity, scale, and science of the All of Us Research Program."
11074904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The goal of this K23 award is to give the PI the skills and preliminary data
needed to improve access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment with buprenorphine among marginalized
individuals via telehealth care. Dr. Aronowitz is proposing a research and career development plan that will
prepare her to become an independent investigator focused on expanding access to OUD treatment and harm
reduction services via innovative care delivery models. OUD continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in the United States. Substantial evidence supports the use of medications for OUD (MOUD) like
buprenorphine; however, 80% of people with OUD receive no treatment; of those who receive treatment, only
a third receive MOUD. Preliminary evidence suggests that a COVID-era policy change allowing for
buprenorphine induction and management via telehealth expanded access. There is little evidence, however,
about how to tailor telehealth models to promote equitable and effective OUD care. Providers may hesitate to
offer MOUD via telehealth to patients they deem “unstable,” even if these patients lack other treatment options.
Given the dearth of accessible treatment options for many individuals, the decision not to offer telehealth may
result in a patient receiving no OUD treatment. Therefore, clinicians need evidence to guide how and to whom
they deliver telehealth OUD treatment. Dr. Aronowitz will develop and test a telehealth model in partnership
with Prevention Point Philadelphia, a harm reduction organization providing MOUD and other services to the
most marginalized people with OUD in the city. The specific aims are to: 1) identify components of an effective
telehealth intervention and barriers to implementation, 2) partner with an advisory board of OUD treatment
stakeholders from different settings to develop a telehealth intervention for OUD treatment with buprenorphine,
and 3) conduct a pilot trial of the telehealth intervention for OUD treatment. The mentorship team brings
together experts in health services research, human-centered design, intervention development, and evidence-
based OUD treatment, and key stakeholder advisors from diverse community settings. This K23 extends Dr.
Aronowitz’s experience as a clinician scientist with four training goals: 1) build skills in contextual inquiry and
human-centered design to support effective intervention development; 2) develop expertise in intervention
mapping, community-partnered research with Black and Latino communities, and stakeholder engagement to
inform intervention development, implementation and sustainment; 3) learn how to conduct field trials ethically
and effectively with marginalized populations; and 4) enhance grant-writing skills for transition to
independence. With successful completion of this project and training Dr. Aronowitz will be well-prepared to
lead an independent research agenda dedicated to improving access to care for people who use drugs. This
project is well-aligned with the strategic objectives of NIDA to leverage technology and innovation, reduce
health disparities, and develop models that address the real-world complexities of substance use."

the long-standing consortium between the Asociacion Civil Impacta Salud y Educacion
(IMPACTA) and the Asociacion Civil Selva Amazonica (ACSA), two nonprofit research
institutions in Peru. They have received over $110 million of investment from the U.S.
NIH during the past 19 years, to establish a comprehensive infrastructure able to support
the implementation of multiple and complex studies from diverse U.S. NIH HIV/AIDS
clinical research networks and to rapidly respond to evolving research opportunities. Two
new institutions are added in this renewal proposal, the Centro de Investigaciones
Tecnologicas, Biomedicas y Medioambientales (CITBM) and the Asociacion Civil Via
Libre. The proposed PERU CTU will be led by Dr. Jorge Sanchez (based at CITBM) and
Dr. Alberto La Rosa (based at IMPACTA), and supported by a cadre of experienced
researchers and promising junior investigators. The PERU CTU consolidated a three-
dimensional matrix organization to support the increasing number and complexity of
studies from multiple HIV/AIDS clinical trial networks, and has effectively utilized its
intellectual and structural resources to create and update innovative tools for more
efficient operations. The PERU CTU proposes to continue efficient and ethical
implementation of the clinical research agenda of the HIV Prevention Trials Network
(HPTN), HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), and AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), at
four Clinical Research Sites (CRSs) in Lima (Barranco, CITBM, San Miguel and Via

Racial residential segregation (RRS) is a form of structural racism and a key driver of the life expectancy gap
for African Americans (AAs) and Black Immigrants (BI) in the U.S. Shorter Black life expectancy is due to
negative consequences of RRS, such as food deserts, pollution, low socioeconomic position, and resource
scarcity. The Black Progress Index (BPI) launched by the Brookings Institution in partnership with the NAACP in
2022, comprises 13 social factors that predict longer life expectancy among Black populations at the county
level, such as home and business ownership, fathers in the households, and social relationships. The BPI
utilizes secondary data to reveal the factors and locales where Black people are living the longest and begins to
(1) identify the environmental, social, cultural, and behavioral factors that drive disparities in life expectancy
between AAs and BIs and (2) develop strategies to reduce or eliminate those disparities and promote active life
expectancy and improve the health status of AAs and BIs.
However, while secondary data and social environment factors are useful to describe some factors that impact
Black longevity, these data do not effectively capture the lived experience of residents at the neighborhood
level. Thus, new community-led measures that capture lived experience including intersectionality and other
complex social constructs (e.g., structural racism) that function as risk and resiliency factors that associated
with Black life expectancy are needed. Mobile data collection platforms that collect real-time, location-based
data on users’ lived experiences and perceptions of their neighborhoods can gather much-needed data to
disentangle negative and positive characteristics Black neighborhoods with relatively low versus high Black
progress (e.g., Black longevity) as measured by the Black Progress Index and the impact those characteristics
have on AA and BI residents’ life expectancy.
We propose a sequential mixed-methods approach that uses mobile technology to enhance community based
participatory research to develop new measures of risk and resiliency factors of structural racism that capture
AA and BIs lived experience of segregated neighborhoods and Black longevity. Additionally, we will develop
dynamic agent-based models that integrate multiple types of data to capture understudied aspects of the legacy
of structural racism, that includes geography, social context, historical racism, and how public money is spent in
Black communities. These models will provide insights on how decision making by government relates to the
less visible structural forces that influence Black longevity. For example, our agent-based models will be able to
provide insights on how financial decision making by government entities impacts patters in education funding,
health funding, parks and public space, police expenditures, cash assistance, and other pecuniary choices
related to structural forces that influence Black longevity. Our research contributes to filling the gap left by
previous studies that have been slow to quantify and measure structural racism's impact on Black longevity,
and sheds new light on the extent to which compositional and contextual effects interact and impact the
variation of Black life expectancy in different regions across the US."

The objective of NASDA’s 2024 Annual Meeting is to provide information on current and emerging feed
and food safety issues impacting agriculture, and to build consensus among the states on regulatory
approaches to these issues. The plenary speakers will give state regulators an opportunity to hear a
national perspective on feed and food safety, something to which they may not be exposed in their
respective states.
NASDA has two membership meetings a year. One is the annual meeting which is hosted in different
state every year; the other is the Winter Policy Conference held in the Washington, DC area. The focus
of the meetings is legislative and regulatory issues of interest to the members. These two occasions and
one additional meeting, held regionally, are opportunities for NASDA members to converse on issues,
make contacts with each other and other leaders, set priorities and goals for the coming year, and meet
face-to-face with NASDA staff and FDA officials.
At recent meetings, NASDA members have stressed the fact that continuous efforts must be made on
the part of the FDA and NASDA members to collaborate and cooperate in discussions on emerging FDA
topics that directly and indirectly affect agriculture. The states and FDA share similar authorities,
missions and responsibilities, and the partners have been working to improve communications. The
passage of the Food Safety and Modernization Act has created a plethora of issues to be discussed and
resolved as we seek to establish an integrated federal-state food and feed safety system. The need for
conversation about the proposed rules and the importance of getting the language in the proposed rules
right the first time cannot be overstated.
The 2024 Annual Meeting presents the opportunity for NASDA members, NASDA staff, and key FDA
leaders to interact with each other, focusing on feed and food safety and regulatory issues, and
promoting partnerships to ensure program success.
The Annual Meeting is three days long, and the agenda includes committee meetings, plenary sessions,
focus sessions, and speakers. NASDA's Food Safety and Nutrition Committee meets during this time to
discuss topics focusing on FDA program areas in which state programs interact. In addition, NASDA
Members and key FDA leadership find time during the meeting for mini-conferences on issues of
interest and concern.
The conference will be held in Indianapolis, IN. NASDA anticipates hosting over 300 participants in
person and an additional 200 participants virtually. Meeting attendees consist of NASDA members and
their staff, NASDA staff, representatives of state and federal regulatory agencies charged with feed and
food safety responsibilities, the regulated industries, and university and research institution
professionals."
11076897,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of new methods for prenatal genetic editing in humans has accelerated the translation of
technologies designed to disrupt disease mechanisms or remove disease-causing mutations entirely. These
technologies show promise for preemptively addressing previously intractable genetic conditions. However,
recent events have demonstrated considerable gaps in the governance structure surrounding human gene
editing and its translation to clinical practice. Since the discovery that a scientist in China had conducted human
experiments allegedly resulting in the birth of three genetically edited children, numerous calls have been made
for a novel governance structure for prenatal human gene editing, frequently framed around moratoria or other
forms of suppression, and several international bodies have convened. There has been strong pressure towards
a values-based governance approach that moves beyond traditional technocratic considerations of safety and
efficacy and takes into account collective normative deliberation about the ethics of prenatal intervention. This is
challenging in the United States context, which is among the few high-income countries without centralized
regulation of research on embryos and/or translational assisted reproductive technologies. As such, two
important stakeholder voices have been largely left out of conversations around the future of prenatal gene
editing in the US context: the patients and families that might be benefitted or harmed by the translation of
prenatal gene editing and the scientists and clinicians who would be on the front lines of clinical translation were
it to move forward. We propose to fill this gap by conducting empirical research with these key stakeholders that
assesses potential governance approaches internationally and explores how they may be implemented in an
United States context. The goal is to move past generalizations to explore the direct policy mechanisms that are
feasible while incorporating the values and priorities of end users.
This study consists of three aims. The first two, contemporaneous, aims will consist of qualitative research with
two sets of stakeholders: patients and families affected by genetic conditions potentially addressable through
prenatal gene editing and clinicians and scientists involved in relevant translational and clinical activities in this
space. In Aim 1, We will begin by conducting a review of the international science policy landscape to gather
policy mechanisms that have been proposed or implemented to manage emerging technologies in the
reproductive science, genetics, and regenerative medicine spaces. We will identify policies that fall into a
spectrum from permissive to restrictive. These policies will be shared with stakeholders during qualitative
interviews to assess their concordance with stakeholder values and priorities. We will recruit a diverse cohort of
clinicians and scientist leaders from 20 key professional societies and conduct qualitative interview to assess
underlying normative underpinnings of proposed policy approaches, professional feasibility of proposals, and
values and priorities around the potential translation of prenatal gene editing in humans. The results of this Aim
will feed directly into the deliberative democracy exercises in Aim 3. In Aim 2, we will partner with Genetic
Alliance, the largest patient advocacy organization for genetic conditions to recruit a panel of patient advisors
from communities affected by 9 genetic conditions from across a spectrum of penetrance and severity. Together
with the advisors we will connect with patient advocacy and support groups in these communities to recruit a
cohort of patients and family members. Patients will be asked to share their understanding of the potential of
gene editing, their aspirations or concerns about its clinical applications, their priorities and goals in research on
their condition, and their views on the proposed policy approaches. In Aim 3 we will convene representatives
from both groups, together with the research team and select policymakers to conduct two deliberative
democracy exercises in which all stakeholders can deliberate towards a consensus on the appropriate
mechanisms for optimal governance of prenatal gene editing technologies. The results of all three aims will be
disseminated in the scientific, lay, and policy literatures."
11078478,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amidst the current opioid overdose crisis, 1.4 million women of reproductive age report non-medical opioid
use, and opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence among pregnant women quadrupled from 1998-2014. Although
pregnancy may be a motivating time to start medications to treat OUD, retention post-partum declines
significantly and is associated with unacceptably high opioid overdose and mortality rates. Injection drug use is
also the primary risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States (U.S.). Women now
comprise nearly half of new HCV infections, and HCV seroprevalence has risen five-fold in pregnant women
since 2000. Although the U.S. is committed to eliminating HCV, about 50% of people are unaware of their
infection and fewer than 40% of those diagnosed have been treated. Research is needed to identify venues
to increase efforts to improve OUD treatment and retention and to identify and treat current HCV
infection. Perinatal care provides longitudinal access to women over a nearly one-year period, and as
pregnancy may be a motivating time for women to seek care for both OUD and HCV, perinatal care may
be a critical venue to reach women who inject drugs, a key population that NIDA identifies as central to
the ongoing opioid crisis. Yet, little data exist to measure the role of the perinatal care venue to improve
OUD and HCV care engagement. This study aims to create a perinatal-specific decision model and measure
health service utilization and costs of a perinatal OUD and HCV intervention to identify how to leverage the
perinatal care venue to decrease postpartum opioid overdoses and population-level HCV transmission. This
study has two main aims: (1) to build a microsimulation model to analyze the clinical and health economic
effects of leveraging the perinatal care venue to reduce opioid overdoses and population-level and infant HCV
transmission; (2) to measure health services utilization and costs of incorporating MOUD and HCV treatment
into perinatal care. The results of this study could help determine most efficient resource allocation to achieve
national overdose and HCV elimination goals. The PI, Dr. Epstein, is an early career investigator, trained in
pediatric and adult infectious diseases, with a focus on addiction medicine and HCV in pregnant women and
youth. This career development award will allow her to gain expertise in 1) transmission modeling and model
calibration and 2) health economic evaluation and micro-costing to be able to conduct comparative cost-
effectiveness research to inform interventions for women with substance use and HCV. She has compiled an
experienced team of mentors and advisors to help her achieve her training and career goals, to become an
independent clinician-investigator expert in utilizing decision science to project most effective use of resources
to improve care for families at the center of the opioid overdose, HCV and HIV epidemics."

The overall hypothesis for this proposal is that deep interrogation of HVTN experimental medicine clinical
trials will provide the information needed to successfully and quickly iterate immunogen design to be able to
select for mature bnAbs in at least 1 or more bnAb B cell lineages by June 2026. The scientific premise is
that studying the frequency of bnAb precursors in blood or leukapheresis cells (naïve or memory B cells) and
LNs both after immunization with germline-targeting and then boosting immunogens will be an optimal strategy
to determine the efficacy of vaccination. We now know that Nojima cultures followed by antigen-specific paired
VH + VL sequencing with 10X genomics is a powerful and rapid way to determine the effect of vaccination with
Env immunogens on HIV bnAb precursor populations in Discovery Medicine Phase I trials. Here we propose
to bring these and other technologies to the study of the HVTN 307, HVTN 309 and HVTN 312 HIV vaccine
clinical trials and in doing so answer critical questions needed to make progress on the design of a practical
HIV vaccine."
11078959,"Request to DAIDS to Manufacture a protein encoding CAP256.wk34.c80 OPT4 envelope for induction of
V2 Apex bnAbs
Induction of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is a global priority; yet, no HIV-1 vaccine regimen reproducibly elicits
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans. The complex immunology underlying human bnAb
development suggests that a successful vaccine will likely contain a series of immunogens that guide bnAb
development 1-3. Such complex vaccines will require iterative design and evaluation in humans, necessitating
rapid cGMP production of potent immunogens. We and others have found that multimerizing HIV-1 Env on
nanoparticles (NPs) can augment its immunogenicity. HIV-1 Env trimer NP immunogens have been made
previously by encoding HIV-1 Env fused to NP subunits as a single gene. These fusion protein NPs display a
mixture of high-quality and low-quality, misfolded HIV-1 Env on their surfaces that can elicit immunodominant
non-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, laborious, time-consuming development work must be performed to
optimize the HIV-1 envelope production such that predominately well-folded envelope is fused to nanoparticle
subunits. Additionally, we have found during cGMP cell line development that protein yields of Env trimer NP
may be insufficient to enable cGMP manufacturing. The significance of this Project is that it will utilize an
already successful cGMP process to rapidly manufacture higher quality HIV-1 Env trimer NPs than previous
NPs encoded by single genes. We have already utilized this technology to overcome the pitfalls incurred with
fusion NPs, by using our innovative conjugation method that generates NPs with only well-folded HIV-1 Env on
their surface. This method utilizes the high specificity of sortase A conjugation to link highly purified, well-folded
HIV-1 Env to ferritin NPs. These sortase A-conjugated NPs (scNPs) can be assembled rapidly and preserve
the antigenic character of the HIV-1 Env, features critical for a vaccine regimen aiming to elicit durable,
protective bnAbs. This innovative, rapid NP platform is universal in nature, having been used for HIV-1 Env
trimers of various clades, SIVcpz Env trimers, and Spike proteins from other human pathogens such as SARS-
CoV-2. We will utilize this platform in combination with CAP256w34.80 designed to guide affinity maturation of
V2 Apex bnAbs in humans."

Alcohol misuse is one of the leading preventable health risks globally, contributing to over 60 different diseases
and injuries. The associated morbidity and mortality impose a significant health and economic burden on society.
Alcohol-induced end organ diseases, including alcohol-associated liver disease, cancer, pancreatitis, and others,
contribute significantly to alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. These diseases often synergize with other
epidemic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and drug abuse. Despite advances in the field, the underlying
disease etiology of alcohol-induced end organ diseases remains poorly understood. There is an urgent need to
gain new knowledge of the molecular underpinnings to accelerate diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. This
R13 proposal seeks support for the Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) on Alcohol-Induced End Organ
Diseases in 2025 and 2027. The overarching goal of the GRC Alcohol-induced End Organ Diseases
meetings is foster open and inclusive discussion of research developments, establish new scientific
collaborations, encourage participation of diverse and underrepresented groups, and propel the next
generation of scientific advances. The GRC was initiated in 2017 and has held successful meetings in 2021
(delayed to 2022) and 2023. The open format of the GRC model allows for sharing significant unpublished work
and provides ample opportunities for in-depth discussions with peers, new colleagues, and the future generation
of alcohol researchers. The GRC on Alcohol-Induced End Organ Diseases plays a crucial role in advancing the
field by providing a platform for the dissemination of key research findings, fostering collaboration, and promoting
scientific progress. The unique format of the conference ensures ample time for in-depth discussions, enabling
the formulation of new approaches and the initiation of collaborations. By providing a safe and respectful forum

Humans move their eyes toward relevant information when making decisions, especially when
making social inferences (e.g. inferences on emotion, trustworthiness, danger, etc.). While
previous research has investigated how human gaze patterns are guided by task demands and
stimulus features, little is known about how humans, especially those with abnormal gaze
patterns, make eye movements toward socially relevant information in a dynamic environment.
This is due to much of the previous literature investigating eye movements in social cognitive
tasks with the use of static stimuli of facial expressions, leaving much to be desired regarding the
generalizability and ecological validity of previous research. Many novel computational and
analytical methods can be used to process dynamic eye-tracking data, such as inter-subject
correlations of gaze patterns between observers that can reveal task engagement and information
processing. Thus, in order to mimic the complex social environment that humans experience in
their everyday lives, more naturalistic experimental designs and stimuli should be implemented
by researchers. Advancements in this area of research can help scientists understand how eye
movements are influenced during dynamic social cognitive tasks, especially in individuals with
known abnormal gaze patterns such as those with depression, autism spectrum disorder, and
schizophrenia.
F99 Phase: The current project uses a novel dynamic emotion tracking task called Inferential
Emotion Tracking in which observers must continuously track the emotion of a target character in
a video (e.g. Hollywood movie, home video, or documentary clip) while observers' eye movements
are recorded. This emotion-tracking paradigm can capture large amounts of data from continuous
emotion ratings and eye-tracking. More importantly, the use of dynamic and context-rich stimuli
to investigate human social cognition can more accurately measure the cognitive mechanisms
that humans use to infer emotion outside of a laboratory setting. Additionally, using eye tracking
while participants complete this emotion perception task will allow us to access where and when
observers look for important emotional cues or information to inform their judgments. Investigating
how humans shift their visual attention during social cognitive tasks will provide valuable insights
into how social visual attention is impacted in vulnerable populations. The training involved in this
phase will include instruction in computational methods related to computer vision models and
the neuroscience of emotion processing to prepare for the K00 phase.
K00 Phase: This phase would include extending my F99 Phase study by investigating the neural
mechanisms of visual attention during complex social cognitive tasks by using fMRI. This
approach could reveal which areas of the brain are involved during the processing of emotions
with the use of dynamic and context-rich stimuli and aims to improve our understanding of how
these areas are impaired in vulnerable populations. Multiple computational methods can be used
to investigate social visual attention with the use of dynamic stimuli and fMRI which can include
using within-brain methods (e.g. event coding, reverse correlation, functional connectivity) and
between-brain methods (e.g inter-subject correlations, inter-subject functional connectivity,
shared representations). The training plan for this phase of the proposal will include developing
expertise in the social neuroscience literature through the mentorship of a prominent sponsor and
training in computational methods involving fMRI analysis."

Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobe that plays a key role in the development of oral biofilms,
or dental plaque, has the remarkable ability to escape host immunity and spread to extraoral sites, including
placenta and colon, where it is associated with significant diseases such as preterm birth and colorectal cancer.
To date, we have a poor understanding of the mechanisms of virulence and disease by F. nucleatum, and the
environmental factors in the extraoral sites that potentially affect the virulence potential of this pathogen.
Considering that ethanolamine (EA) – an important source of carbon/nitrogen and energy, and a signaling
molecule for some bacterial pathogens – is abundant in placenta during fetal development, we aim to test the
central hypothesis that regulated EA metabolism via a specialized organelle, bacterial microcompartment (BMC),
modulates the virulence potential of F. nucleatum. This hypothesis is based on our compelling preliminary data
showing that environmental EA stimulates BMC formation and expression of EA utilization genes, and that
blockage in EA catabolism alters the pathogenicity of F. nucleatum. The major goal of this application is to
examine how BMC-mediated EA utilization affects fusobacterial virulence (Aim 1) and how blockage in EA
catabolism modulates fusobacterial pathogenicity (Aim 2). The results generated from our studies will not only
provide important knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of F. nucleatum and promising therapeutic targets,
but also have potential to advance the broad field of host-pathogen interactions."

Building upon the parent CSBC U01 project that investigates the role of bone mesenchymal stem/stromal cells
in fostering the early outgrowth of disseminated tumor cells, this supplement project expands to unravel tumor-
immune cell interactions in clinically advanced bone metastases, particularly focusing on HER2-low breast
cancer resistance to T-DXd treatment. HER2-low breast cancer accounts for 45–55% of all breast cancer
cases, and bone metastasis is more common in this subtype than others. Novel HER2-directed antibody-drug
conjugate (ADC) agent, trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), has shown antitumor activity in HER2-low tumors.
However, a significant portion of patients showed de novo resistance. Surprisingly, 25% of the HER2-zero
cohort showed measurable objective response. These findings suggest the involvement of additional factors
beyond HER2 expression levels in determining T-DXd response and/or resistance. Our preliminary study,
using NanoString GeoMX spatial proteomics, in investigating eleven bone metastasis patients’ samples (4
responders vs. 7 non-responders to the T-DXd treatment), highlighted a complicated correlation between
various immune features and T-DXd treatment responsiveness. In this project, we will employ the CosMX
single-cell 6,000-plex mRNA and 64-plex protein platform to profile the bone metastasis niche, leverage the
MD-SPACER computational tool developed from the parent U01 project to analyze cell-cell/cell-niche
interactions and the Wong lab's S2C2 tool to model spatial cell-cell crosstalk intracellular and intercellular
signaling. This project marks a new collaboration between Wong’s team and Dr. Bill Li, a clinical pathologist
from the Emory Winship Cancer Institute, and Dr. Wenjuan Dong, an immunologist at the Houston Methodist
Cancer Center. Neither Li nor Dong is funded by any CSBC program. In addition, this project will involve two
MD/PhD trainees who will gain hands-on experience in spatial omics experimentation and analysis."
11066934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco use remains at alarming high rates amongst individuals with serious mental illness, such as
schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and recurring depressive disorders. Smoking tobacco is the number one
preventable cause of death in this population, shortening the lifespan of adults with serious mental illness by
25 years and contributing to $317 billion in healthcare expenditures and indirect loss of earnings and disability
benefits. Novel and effective models to deliver wider-reaching smoking cessation interventions to individuals
with serious mental illness are highly needed and indicated as a priority for NIH. Mobile apps are a promising
method to deliver smoking cessation treatments to people with serious mental illness. Despite numerous apps
available to use for people with serious mental illness, our feasibility research has demonstrated that using
these apps presents daunting challenges for this population. Based on this work, we developed Learn to Quit,
a user-centered smoking cessation app tailored to the needs of individuals with serious mental illness. The
app’s main active ingredient is a novel behavioral treatment that has shown promise as a smoking cessation
intervention -- Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The app provides education about the use of nicotine
replacement therapy and recommendations from US Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure alignment with best
clinical practices. In a recent pilot randomized controlled trial (R00 DA037276), comparing Learn to Quit versus
NCI’s QuitGuide, we demonstrated: (1) high recruitment and retention rates, (2) high levels of user
engagement with Learn to Quit, (3) an effective method to conduct a large multi-site randomized controlled
trial, and (4) promising cessation outcomes. While this developmental work provides initial evidence of Learn to
Quit’s usability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy, a large scale randomized controlled trial is needed to test
its efficacy in a representative sample of patients with serious mental illness. Therefore, the proposed study
will: (1) employ a randomized parallel arm design to compare the efficacy of Learn to Quit vs. NCI’s QuitGuide,
(2) use rigorous methods to evaluate mediators of app engagement and app efficacy, and (3) examine the
cost-effectiveness of Learn to Quit compared to a non-tailored app designed for the general population. The
study addresses a serious problem -- high smoking rates among people with serious mental illness -- and
proposes to test the efficacy of an easily-accessible smoking cessation intervention, using technology with the
potential for high population-level reach."

11073842,"A major complication of mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSD) for multi-organ
support is the dichotomous pathology of thrombosis and bleeding. Intravascular
hemolysis associated with MCSD produces free hemoglobin (fHb). Adsorption of
fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (VWF) onto non-biological surfaces captures
platelets that may aggregate. We reported that high levels of fHb increased VWF-
mediated platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on fibrin(ogen)-coated surfaces at
high shear stress. Importantly, fHb increased the flow-dependent adhesion of formalin
fixed platelets to a VWF coated surface, suggesting that fHb directly enhances the VWF-
glycoprotein (GP)Ib interaction. VWF deficiency or antibodies against GPIb block the
enhancement of platelet adhesion by fHb, validating the role of VWF. Lastly, our
identification of ultra large VWF (ULVWF) in whole blood exposed to fHb and high shear
rates suggests that platelet derived ULVWF may contribute to the pathology of thrombosis
in the presence of high levels of fHb. Together, these findings provide the first evidence
that high levels of fHb are critical for VWF-mediated thrombosis on surfaces coated with
fibrin(ogen), and that ULVWF multimers from shear-activated platelets may enhance
thrombosis more robustly than plasma VWF in the presence of fHb. Our overarching
hypothesis is that fHb targets VWF, including the platelet-derived VWF, to promote
platelet adhesion via GPIb, and potentiate fibrin formation by facilitating the binding of
VWF to fibrinogen. We propose molecular, biochemical, and structural studies to
investigate the mechanisms by which fHb dysregulates the interactions between VWF,
fibrin(ogen), and platelets. Aim 1 will investigate the contributions of platelet VWF vs.
plasma VWF to thrombosis. We will test the hypotheses that fHb interaction with platelet
VWF enhances platelet adhesion to fibrin(ogen) and potentiates fibrin formation more
robustly than plasma VWF. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that fHb-bound VWF has a
conformation that favors platelet adhesion. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism by which
fHb dysregulate VWF-fibrin(ogen) interaction. We will test the hypotheses that fHb
promotes VWF-fibrin(ogen) association and modulates the VWF-mediated fibrin
formation. These studies will describe new mechanisms related to thrombosis in patients
on MCSD and identify new, potential targets for therapeutic interventions in fHb-induced
thrombosis."
11074358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The clinical treatment of limb threatening injuries requires complex surgical management and a lifetime
of corrective surgeries and physical therapy. There is an unmet clinical need for regenerative approaches that
can functionally repair both muscle and adjacent bone. Our prior research has shown that spatial patterning cues
from nanoscale extracellular matrices modulate the cellular inflammatory phenotype, angiogenic potential, and
skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have further shown that when these patterned materials are combined with
running exercise, that large volumetric muscle injuries in mice can be regenerated comparable to native tissue.
Therefore, the goal of the parent grant, was to define the regenerative relationship between bone and muscle
healing as well as couple engineered muscle with free running exercise to enhance local tissue regeneration.
The overarching research goal of this supplement is to identify the characteristics of an optimal exercise regime
for rehabilitation and regeneration after complex traumatic injury and co-treatment with an engineered muscle.
This will be explored through the application of a comprehensive post-injury exercise regimen that varies in
duration, frequency, intervention type, and timing. The proposal first examines the contribution of exercise
frequency (sessions per week) and duration (length of each session) on tissue regeneration and limb functional
recovery. This approach will allow us to determine the impact of fatigue and recovery time on a diverse set of
healing outcomes which include in situ muscle force production, microCT imaging to evaluate bone density and
volume, dynamic weight bearing and tactile allodynia to assess mobility and pain, and systemic inflammatory
cytokine profiling. We will also examine how different forms of exercise intervention (contraction and loading)
and timing (how soon after injury) guide these same regenerative outcomes. The research outcomes of the
proposed body of work for this supplement will: 1) generate new data on rehabilitation protocols that extends
beyond free running; 2) expands the capacity of healing metrics to examine dynamic weight bearing and pain
sensitization as primary functional health assessments; 3) characterizes the immune profile of circulating
cytokines in response to injury and exercise. The proposed studies will establish an effective rehabilitation
protocol that works in concert with our engineered muscle therapy to enhance the regenerative response to
rehabilitation therapies following severe musculoskeletal injury. This award supplement will provide training in
research and career development to support the mission of promoting diversity in health-related research. The
proposed candidate, Joshua Vanderpool, will receive training in muscle biology, biomaterial fabrication, cell
culture, exercise physiology, animal injury and behavioral models, in vivo imaging, histology, and image analysis.
Additionally, they will receive guided career development through a formalized Individual Development Plan,
attendance of professional writing and innovators workshops, presentation of research findings at conferences,
continued training in ethics, and opportunities for peer mentorship and student leadership experience."
11075682,"SUMMARY
Psychomotor-stimulant Use Disorder (PUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder, characterized by a high propensity
for relapse even during protracted abstinence. In both humans with PUD & animal models, the intensity of cue-
elicited drug craving & drug-seeking behavior increases or “incubates” during protracted withdrawal. The
neurochemical underpinnings of drug craving & its incubation are not well understood. Drug cue-induced
increase in metabolic hyperactivity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is correlated with the intensity of
drug-craving in humans. Consistent with this, we have reported a link between the magnitude of drug-seeking in
a rat model of cocaine-taking & an increased activational state of several kinases, including mTOR, Akt, PI3K &
PKCε. My dissertation work also identified increased indices of calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
activation within the prelimbic cortex (PL) subregion of the mPFC, that appears to be selective for cocaine as it
is not observed in rats exhibiting incubated sucrose-seeking. CaMKII has long been considered central to long-
term plasticity implicated in learning/memory & substance use disorders. Despite this, no published report has
examined the role for CaMKII activation within PFC subregions in cocaine-craving, let alone its incubation during
protracted withdrawal. CaMKII can be activated by the influx of calcium inhibition through calcium-permeable
ionotropic glutamate receptors, including NMDA and GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, which I propose are
activated by the cue-sensitized glutamate release in cocaine incubated rats. Activated CaMKII can regulate
AMPA and NMDA receptor signaling and synaptic plasticity, which may drive the cocaine-incubated state. The
objective of the F99 phase of this proposal is to investigate the role of NMDA-CaMKII in the mPFC in incubated
cocaine-seeking using neuropharmacological techniques.
The proposed project will also help the candidate, Ms. Laura Huerta Sanchez, achieve her career goal of
becoming an independent investigator at a top-tier academic/research institution. This project provides training
in valuable research techniques, including immunoblotting, cytology & histology & neuropharmacological
approaches. Further, the proposed studies will provide professional & technical training to prepare the candidate
to successfully transition to a postdoctoral position (K00) in a laboratory that studies the neural circuitry driving
vulnerability to drug-seeking behavior. The complete plan proposed here for both the F99 and K00 phases has
been designed to develop an independent neurobiologist prepared for a transition to a successful postdoctoral
position and, ultimately, independent tenured investigator."

 Microsporidia are unicellular, ​fungal​ parasites with a wide host-range, from insects to humans. ​They are
emerging pathogens, classified as NIAID Category B opportunistic pathogens, and cause microsporidiosis in
immunocompromised patients.​ To gain entry into a target cell, microsporidia employ a remarkably unique and
specialized harpoon-like invasion machinery called the polar tube, which is conserved among microsporidial
species. While initially coiled neatly within the spore of the parasite, infection of a new cell begins with the rapid
extrusion of the polar tube from the spore on a fast timescale (< 2s), which anchors the spore to the host cell.
After it has been fired, the polar tube is thought to act as a conduit for the transfer of the infectious
“sporoplasm” into the target cell, where replication can begin. Early work has yielded global insights into this
process, and the molecular and structural underpinnings of the invasion process are ripe for exploration with
modern techniques, such as cryo electron microscopy. This work aims to address fundamental questions and
paradoxes in our understanding of the microsporidial polar tube machinery and how it drives invasion into host
cells. We will use a combined bottom-up (structural biology, biochemistry and other ​in vitro​ techniques on
purified proteins) and top-down (​in vivo​ light microscopy, electron tomography) approach; the intersection of
these approaches will allow us to unravel the mechanistic biology of this unique invasion process. ​Here we
focus on three human pathogens: ​Anncaliia algerae, Encephalitozoon cuniculi​ and ​Encephalitozoon hellem​.
 The specific aims are 1) To characterize the dynamics of polar tube firing and movement of sporoplasm
through the tube using high-speed optical microscopy, and to comprehensively define the composition of the
polar tube​ using mass spectrometry; 2) To biochemically and structurally characterize the individual protein
components of the polar tube organelle using X-ray crystallography, single particle cryo electron microscopy
and protein-protein interaction assays; 3) To elucidate the overall architecture and packing of the polar tube in
the spore using structural cell biology techniques such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy
(SBFSEM) and cryo focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryo FIB-SEM) followed by cryo electron
tomography (cryo ET)."

The normal platelet count in human blood is 150,000-400,000/μL, and these platelets are responsible for efficient
hemostatic surveillance and bleeding mitigation in the body. Thrombocytopenia (TCP, low platelet count) is a
condition caused by a decrease in platelet production, increase in platelet destruction or consumption, or
increase in splenic sequestration. The age-adjusted prevalence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is
estimated to be 3.3 per 100,000 persons in the USA, while drug-induced TCP affects 1-2 per 100,000 persons.
The majority (>95%) of TCP cases result from autoimmune disorders or are induced by chemo- and
radiotherapies as well as other pharmaceuticals. At platelet counts <50,000/μL, surgical procedures are
complicated by high bleeding risks and any minor injury may lead to excessive bleeding. At counts <10,000/μL,
spontaneous bleeding becomes a major concern. Therefore, frequent therapeutic and prophylactic platelet
transfusions are required to increase platelet counts and mitigate bleeding risks. However, the availability of
natural platelet products is severely limited by a near-static pool of donors and a very short shelf-life (3-5 days)
due to high risks of bacterial contamination and storage-related platelet activation and degranulation. Therefore,
there exists a significant unmet clinical need for a therapeutic agent that can mitigate bleeding complications
intravenously in TCP patients, while allowing reduced contamination and long shelf-life without compromising
function. To this end, we have developed a synthetic hemostatic nanotechnology, called SynthoPlateTM, that
mimics platelet’s ability to adhere and aggregate specifically at a site of injury in the body. In Phase I of this
SBIR, we demonstrated platelet-mimetic hemostatic functions in vitro as well as in vivo in proof-of-concept TCP
murine models of bleeding. Building on this in the proposed Phase II studies, we aim to: 1) Establish appropriate
clinical biomarkers for monitoring SP efficacy in thrombocytopenic (TCP) patient blood samples, 2) determine
the effective pharmacodynamic (PD) dosing window of SynthoPlateTM in a rabbit bleeding model of
thrombocytopenia, and 3) establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SP in healthy and thrombocytopenic
(TCP) rabbits. Altogether, these experiments will establish and correlate PK with ex vivo functional assays and
in vivo PD to guide clinical evaluation. Success in this Phase II proposal will be used to generate a Target Product
Profile (TPP), which will guide clinical protocol design, as well as aid in raising follow-on-funding and partnerships
for product development from multiple potential sources. Building on these results, Phase III will implement
defined dosage guidelines for IND-enabling Pharm/Tox studies with GMP-manufactured SP and thereby
progress towards submitting an IND application for clinical evaluation."
11079388,"Polyketides are used more frequently in human medicine than any other class of secondary
metabolites, and comprise roughly 20% of top-selling small-molecule drugs. Despite their
importance: (a) All polyketides used in human medicine are derived from soil bacteria and are
prepared via fermentation or semi-synthesis (notwithstanding eribulin), (b) <5% of soil bacteria
are amenable to culture, many phyla have eluded culture, and the few bacteria amenable to
culture express <10% of their biosynthetic genes, (c) although marine polyketides possess an
astonishing array of biological activities, commercial fermentation processes involving marine
bacteria (which are often symbionts) remain exceptionally uncommon. De novo chemical
synthesis potentially offers entry to otherwise inaccessible polyketides and their congeners, yet
current synthetic methods often do not avail sufficiently concise routes for large scale production.
To overcome this challenge, our laboratory has pioneered a broad, new family of catalytic
methods for the direct stereo- and site-selective conversion of lower alcohols to higher alcohols.
As documented in numerous total syntheses, these methods streamline polyketide construction,
allowing the target compounds to be prepared in significantly fewer steps than previously
possible.
In the proposed funding period, 3 specific aims are proposed: (a) Total syntheses of the type I
polyketides neaumycin B and gladiolin will be pursued using our catalytic methods. Neaumycin B
is a femtomolar inhibitor of U87 human glioblastoma. Gladiolin displays potent, selective activity
against M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to the frontline antibiotics isoniazid and
rifampicin. (b) The type II polyketide antibiotics formicamycins G, H and J, arenimycin A and
analogues of viridicatumtoxin will be prepared using our catalytic methods. Antibacterial
properties of these compounds will be evaluated in collaboration with Prof. Barrie Wilkinson
and Prof. Jean Chmielewski. (c) Ruthenium-catalyzed reactions relevant to polyketide
construction (allylation, crotylation, propargylation, etc.) will be developed. Optimization of these
methods will be assisted by computational studies performed by Prof. Kuo-Wei Huang. Thus,
our studies advance an integrated program in which methodological innovation informs
synthesis, and synthesis informs medicinal chemistry."

The affirmative action restrictions issued by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) on June 29,
2023, significantly limit the use of race-conscious admissions in higher education. The impact of this court
ruling extends beyond undergraduate education to encompass MD and MD-PhD programs, where affirmative
action has played a vital role in raising the representation of Black, LatinX, and Native American students from
less than 2% in 1964 to over 20% in 2022. Prior state-level affirmative action bans have been associated with
a 37% relative reduction in the proportion of matriculated students from underrepresented ethnoracial
backgrounds. As such, restricting affirmative action nationally threatens decades of progress in improving
healthcare workforce diversity. This is alarming, considering the benefits of an ethnoracially diverse physician
and physician-scientist workforce, which include improved access to care, higher quality of care, better
treatment outcomes for both minoritized and white patients, and greater scientific innovation. The
consequences of the SCOTUS affirmative action restrictions are currently unknown, and the ruling poses
several knowledge gaps that we seek to address in this study. Firstly, we will determine the impact of the
SCOTUS affirmative action ruling on MD and MD-PhD program racial and ethnic diversity and the climate of
equity and inclusion within MD and MD-PhD programs. Second, we will describe how MD and MD-PhD
programs adapt applicant selection criteria following SCOTUS restrictions on race-conscious admissions.
Third, we will characterize the application and matriculation experiences of Black, LatinX, and Native American
MD and MD-PhD students following SCOTUS affirmative action restrictions. Our findings will be disseminated
widely as peer-reviewed scientific publications, conference presentations, policy and advocacy reports, and
podcasts to various stakeholders in education and health policy via partnership with the Association of
American Medical Colleges, the American Medical Association, and the National Academy of Medicine."
11059634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic villitis of unknown etiology (CVUE) is diagnosed in 10-15% of all term placentas and is characterized
by the infiltration of maternal T lymphocytes into the chorionic villi with corresponding trophoblast necrosis.
This inflammation accompanies 40-60% of fetal growth restriction (FGR) cases, 20-30% of stillbirths, and
infants with a CVUE diagnosis are 4 times more likely to be neurodevelopmentally delayed. Importantly,
approximately 55% of patients with a CVUE diagnosis will have recurrent disease, making this a clinically
significant placental finding. However, consequences of this diagnosis are rarely considered clinically due to
the paucity of data surrounding the biologic mechanisms promoting CVUE. These gaps have resulted in our
inability to predict and/or prevent new and recurrent disease. CVUE is hypothesized to be either a maternal
alloimmune response to the fetus or an undiagnosed infection, both of which would have shared
immune mechanisms but different antigen targets. We previously showed that CVUE placenta
downregulate immune checkpoint receptors and upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to
promote T cell activation. We also demonstrated that expansion of T cell clones occurs during CVUE, but not
in response to common viruses. Preliminary data presented in this application demonstrates that patients with
CVUE have elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the blood and placenta and these maternal
T cells may be responding to a common placental antigen. Still, there remains no definitive explanation as to
the antigen specificity or local mechanisms at the maternal fetal interface that control or amplify this abnormal
immune response. Therefore, this study is significant as it will define whether CVUE is an infectious or
alloimmune pathology and describe changes in placental MHC and co-stimulatory receptor expression which
leads to activation and cytotoxicity by maternal T cells against these antigens. Access to unique institutional
resources, multidisciplinary expertise, and novel approaches makes our application highly innovative. Our
hypothesis is that increased major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on antigen presenting cells
(APCs) in the periphery and trophoblast cells of the placenta promotes maternal T cells to recognize and
respond to fetal antigens, leading to CVUE. We will address this hypothesis in two specific aims by: 1)
assessing the impact of CVUE inflammation on MHC and co-stimulatory receptors in the placenta to promote T
cell mediated cytotoxicity and 2) identifying mechanisms of maternal T cell activation and expansion in
response to fetal-specific antigens during CVUE. This study will create the most comprehensive immunologic
understanding of systemic- and tissue-mediated mechanisms of CVUE pathogenesis to date. These data are
critical for future studies that address diagnosis of CVUE in utero and test therapeutic strategies, such as
immune modulating agents, for prevention of CVUE and its associated fetal morbidity and mortality."

This project’s long-term goal is to understand immunological mechanisms of asthma and type 2 immunity.
Airway inflammation in patients with asthma is generally characterized by increased lymphocytes producing
type 2 cytokines. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) that rapidly produce large quantities of type 2
cytokines have been implicated in the innate arm of type 2 immunity and pathophysiology of allergic
diseases. However, several major questions remain: How are ILC2s involved in promoting or regulating type
2 airway inflammation? Do ILC2s work in concert with other immune cells, such as CD4+ T cells? If so, how?
And, importantly, do ILC2s in a mature immune/microbial environment, like the adult human body, behave
similarly to those in laboratory mice that are housed in a clean environment? The objective of this application
is to address these gaps in our knowledge.
To achieve the goal of this project, we began to directly analyze the roles of ILC2s by deleting them using a
genetic approach in mice. When naïve animals were acutely exposed to a natural airborne allergen, the Th2-
type memory responses were markedly reduced in ILC2-deficient mice. Paradoxically, when naïve animals
were exposed repeatedly to the same allergen, ILC2-deficient mice showed a marked increase in their levels
of type 2 cytokines and eosinophilic airway inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that lung ILC2s serve as
a master regulator in the airways by promoting and suppressing adaptive type 2 immune responses,
depending on the context.
In Aim 1, we will define the roles of lung ILC2s in the development of immune memory during acute allergen
exposure. We will investigate how ILC2s promote antigen-specific Th2-type tissue-resident memory T cells.
In Aim 2, we will determine the regulatory roles of lung ILC2s in allergen-induced chronic airway
inflammation. We will investigate how lung ILC2s in concert with regulatory CD4+ T cells suppress excessive
immune responses and inflammation. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the roles of lung ILC2s in mice with
physiologic microbial exposure. We will leverage a novel “dirty mice” model and characterize the functions of
ILC2s in mice that have been exposed naturally to pathogens and microbes, similarly to humans.
We will integrate several mouse models to investigate the cause-effect relationships between ILC2s and type
2 immunity in the airways. The tools, technical expertise, and resource necessary to accomplish this project
are in place. Successful completion of this proposal will help to explain how type 2 immune responses
develop, persist, and are regulated in the airways and how ILC2s contribute to these processes. Ultimately,
these studies will clarify the immunological mechanisms and pathophysiology of asthma and related airway
disorders, allowing for development of novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment for the diseases."

The generation of long-lasting humoral immunity is the purpose of almost all vaccines. Long-lasting humoral
immunity is mediated through antibodies produced by long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) and memory B cells
(MBCs) that respond rapidly to pathogens. Despite the outstanding success of vaccinations overall, many clinical
and experimental vaccines fail to induce long-lasting humoral immunity. One key example is the influenza
vaccine, which requires administration every year.
Upon encountering a foreign antigen, antigen-specific B cells proliferate and differentiate into germinal center
(GC) B cells and subsequently generate LLPCs and MBCs. B cell receptor and CD40 receptor signaling result
in the activation of NFkB in GC B cells. It is well established that transcription factors NFkB cRel and RelA are
critical for physiological B cell responses and that their misregulation leads to B cell-mediated diseases. cRel
and RelA are essential for generating GC B cells and plasma cells (PCs). The activation of cRel and RelA
depends on the degradation of inhibitors of NFkB (IkBs). IkBa and IkBe have different binding preferences to
cRel and RelA. IkBa binds to RelA-containing dimer (RelA:p50) with a higher affinity than cRel-containing dimer
(cRel:p50), whereas IkBe binds to cRel:p50 with a higher affinity than RelA:p50. The network of IkBa, IkBe, cRel,
and RelA is defined here as the NFkB signaling network. The role of the NFkB signaling network in generating
LLPCs versus MBCs is unknown. This project will define the role of the NFkB signaling network in the generation
of LLPCs versus MBCs. The objective of Aim 1 is to define how IkBa and IkBe regulate the generation of LLPCs
and MBCs. The objective of Aim 2 is to identify how cell surface receptors regulate cRel and RelA expression in
GC B cells, leading to the generation of LLPCs and MBCs. The objective of Aim 3 is to determine whether the
vaccine-induced response of IkBa-deficient and IkBe-deficient mice can enhance humoral immunity against
influenza infection.
The proposed research is innovative because it connects the cell signaling and transcriptional network of GC B
cells to the generation of LLPCs and MBCs and translates this mechanistic knowledge to generate long-lasting
humoral immunity against influenza viruses. This work uses newly generated cRel and RelA fluorescence
reporter mice and IkBe and IkBa knock-out mice. The combination of single-cell/bulk RNA-Seq, BCR-Seq, flow
cytometry, and intravital imaging will reveal new insights into the generation of long-lived humoral immunity that
can be applied to vaccination strategy for influenza and other infectious diseases. The proposed research is
expected to define the mechanism that allows the NFkB signaling network to regulate different gene regulatory
programs within phenotypically-identical GC B cells to generate LLPCs and MBCs, identifying a promising target
for the development of longer-lasting vaccines for influenza and other highly mutating pathogens."

Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are a group of allergic inflammatory disorders characterized by
excessive accumulation and persistence of eosinophils and a Th2-dominant immune response. EGID
symptoms and treatments carry heavy social and psychological tolls, particularly in affected children. Despite a
worldwide increase in prevalence, the natural disease course of EGIDs is unknown, and treatment options
limited to food allergen avoidance and oral corticosteroids. Eosinophils are innate immune leukocytes that
constitutively home to the small and large intestine in the steady state where they contribute to immune, tissue,
and microbiome homeostasis. Why and how eosinophils shift to pathologic roles, and what those pathologic
roles are within the context of EGIDs, is unknown and represents a fundamental knowledge gap hindering the
development of needed therapeutic approaches. Our published studies during the previous funding cycle
contributed to an evolving paradigm in eosinophil biology that now recognizes the existence of tissue-specific
adaptations and distinct functional phenotypes within mucosal organs. We demonstrated morphologic, spatial
and phenotypic heterogeneity of intestinal eosinophils, proposed a framework to stratify tissue eosinophils with
“homeostatic” versus “inflammatory” potentials, and traced sub-phenotype versatility in situ within the contexts
of local allergic, and systemic non-specific, inflammation. These studies provide a scaffolding for functional
outcomes and spatial mapping proposed in this renewal application. Our preliminary data also show that notch
2 signaling is active in human blood eosinophils, drives a cytokine-activated transcriptome, and is required for
cytokine-mediated survival. To explore notch 2 signaling in vivo we generated a new mouse line with
eosinophil-targeted deletion (EoN2). EoN2 mice exhibit impaired intestinal tissue-specific adaptations of
eosinophils at baseline, and the selective loss of a villus-migrated, putatively “inflammatory” eosinophil subset
in an allergen-driven EGID model. Building on and extending these findings, this renewal application applies
novel tools created in the first cycle to explore the overarching hypothesis that notch 2 signaling underlies
intestinal tissue specific adaptations of eosinophils in the steady state and regulates their functional
phenotypes in inflammation. Aim 1 uses complementary high dimensional flow cytometry and multispectral
imaging to define and integrate eosinophil functional subsets with spatial mapping and translate advances in
profiling and spatial mapping to active EGID patient biopsies. Aim 2 exploits notch 2-dependent regulation of
eosinophils to investigate functional phenotypes within the context of allergic inflammation. Aim 3 uses genetic
and pharmacologic approaches to trial therapeutic targeting of notch 2 in mouse models of EGIDs. Completion
of these aims will provide fundamental insights into the regulation of tissue-specific adaptations and functional
phenotypes of intestinal eosinophils that will direct the development of precision therapeutic approaches in
EGIDs."

Children and adolescents with developmental language disorder (OLD) are at elevated risk for mental
health problems compared to their peers with typical language skills. The specific causes of increased mental
health problems in individuals with OLD are currently unknown, but evidence points to emotion regulation (ER)
difficulty as a potentially important contributor. ER is the effective engagement of cognitive, behavioral, and
physiological processes needed to change or maintain emotional states. It is critical to understand ER in
children with OLD because ER difficulties are associated with many psychiatric disorders and have been
implicated as a transdiagnostic risk factor for the development of mental health problems.
Studies suggest children with OLD display significantly worse ER skills than typically developing
children, but the number of studies investigating ER in OLD are few. Additionally, in the extant studies, thirdparty
ratings are the only measure of ER. This is problematic because parent report cannot provide information
on internal ER processes (e.g., subjective experience or physiology). Additionally, rating scales previously
used to measure ER in children with OLD do not differentiate between contexts (e.g., those requiring
substantial linguistic processing and skill, and those that have decreased linguistic demands). Children with
OLD may only experience deficits in ER within certain environments, e.g., those that place demands on
linguistic processing, which is a primary deficit for children with OLD, rather than in domain-general tasks.
The proposed project will address both gaps through the measurement of self-report, behavioral, and
physiological indicators of ER during a linguistically demanding task and a domain-general task. Thus, in
evaluating the ER of children with OLD using subjective, behavioral, and physiological measures, the proposed
study will support determination of whether certain indicators of ER difficulties in OLD emerge only in
environments that tax their linguistic resources or if they extend to domain-general contexts. This study aligns
with the NIH NIDCD's mission and strategic plan through enhancing understanding of normal function and
disordered processes of language. Ultimately, the proposed study will inform the assessment of ER in children
with OLD and may lead to more precise and more timely identification of difficulties, which in turn would allow
for earlier targeted interventions. The central purpose of this proposal is to provide training opportunities and
mentorship in theories of psychological intervention, in physiological methodologies, and in advanced statistical
analyses (e.g., linear mixed modeling). Training will also focus on scientific dissemination, project
management, and responsible conduct of research. This will strengthen the career development of the
candidate as she prepares for independence as an investigator in communication sciences and disorders."

Intra-body Wireless Sensor Link – Large Animal Testing
 This supplement will extend the work to develop new capabilities for the COSMIIC
System by testing the intra-body wireless system in a large animal model. Two modules under
current development are the “WING” and Sensor Withdrawn from A Remote Module
(SWARM). These will allow for real-time feedback of physiologic data to facilitate control for
closed-loop nerve stimulation algorithms. The WING module is intended to connect to wireless
devices and sensors outside the body, and the SWARM is designed for connection to tethered
sensors like inertial measurement units (IMUs) inside the body. Neither module, however,
supports data communication from untethered sensors within the body. With this supplement,
we propose to develop an intra-body wireless link that interfaces with the SWARM to enable
untethered, remote sensors to connect to the COSMIIC system. This will allow the COSMIIC
system to receive physiological feedback from sensors which cannot be safely accessed using
wires, or from sensors that only reside in the body for limited periods.
 This supplement will further validate the intrabody wireless system acutely in vivo to
assess accuracy of data capture when measuring physiological data (bladder pressure) in real
time. Additionally, we will demonstrate triggered nerve stimulation from received data. This
final proof-of-concept experiment will demonstrate that the intrabody wireless system and the
COSMIIC system are feasible for closed-loop neuromodulation in future studies."
11075686,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excitatory ionotropic synapses and their associated dendritic spines play critical roles in fundamental
information processing within the brain. The development and morphology of these synapses are highly
functionally relevant; previous studies have established that patients with many different neurodevelopmental,
neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric conditions are clinically defined by synaptopathies. Synaptopathies,
or disease at the level of the synapse, includes inappropriate loss of synapses and spines, enhanced or
lowered synapse and spine development, and aberrations to the synaptic structure that leads to dysfunctional
signaling. The Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI) subfamily of neuronal adhesion G-protein coupled
receptors (aGPCRs) are a three-member postsynaptic family of receptors predicted to form trans-synaptic
complexes to direct synaptogenesis and synapse structural development. BAI2 is the least studied of these
proteins, with no established role in neuronal or synaptic development. BAI2 also appears to be the most
functionally non-redundant member of the BAI family. Though whole exome data from human patients with
autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder suggests all BAI proteins are implicated in these
conditions, BAI2 does not bind the same presynaptic proteins as BAI1 and BAI3. Furthermore, a gain-of-
function mutation to BAI2 is the putative cause of a rare spastic paraparesis condition in humans, and loss-of-
function mutations are associated with hyperactive behavior in mice. Addressing the fundamental role and
molecular mechanism of BAI2 thus can help us understand both basic synapse development, and potentially
inform future studies into treatments of psychiatric and central nervous system-derived motor disorders. To this
end, my data on BAI2 suggests that the protein localizes to the PSD and promotes both pre- and postsynaptic
development. I propose to further define the role of BAI2 in synapse and spine development by delineating the
functional domains that regulate synapse development (Aim 1.1), quantifying nanostructural changes to
synaptic structures (Aim 1.2), and describing functional deficits (Aim 1.3) induced by loss of BAI2. In the future,
I plan to pursue a postdoctoral position investigating real-time changes to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
nanodomains and signaling in baseline, plasticity, and disease conditions (Aim 2)."
11076619,"Background: Veterans disproportionately suffer cigarette-related disease and death relative to the general
population, but Veterans often endorse low motivation to quit. Analysis of client language with unmotivated
smokers may provide new insights into how motivation shifts in response to different therapies. Therapies for
unmotivated smokers include motivational interviewing (MI), which aims to enhance intrinsic motivation by
resolving ambivalence; and health education (HE), which delivers scripted health advice. MI research suggests
that increased in-session client “change talk” (CT), or language reflecting commitment to change the target
behavior, relative to “sustain talk” (ST), or language reflecting plans to continue the target behavior, is
associated with improved treatment outcomes. HE may contain client statements reflecting learning, or
“learning talk” (LT), in response to health information, which may lead to improved outcomes through a
different therapeutic mechanism. We propose to analyze client language from two randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) comparing MI to HE with unmotivated smokers conducted by our Co-Investigators, including 1) a
community RCT with 255 unmotivated smokers; and 2) a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) pilot study with
85 Veteran smokers with mental illness, of which a subset reported low motivation to quit. Analysis of client
language in MI and HE sessions from these studies with unmotivated smokers will provide insight into the
mechanisms underlying MI and HE. Significance/Impact: Given the high prevalence of smoking in Veterans,
identifying therapeutic techniques associated with positive outcomes in unmotivated smokers has great
potential to improve Veteran health. This project addresses HSR&D priorities of mental health, primary care
practice, and quality/safety. Innovation: This mixed methods project is the first of its kind to examine aspects
of in-session client language as predictors of treatment outcomes in unmotivated smokers, a population
representative of most Veteran smokers in VHA care. Specific Aims: Aim 1 is to code client language in audio
recorded MI and HE sessions from two RCTs with unmotivated smokers, including a community sample and a
Veteran sample. We hypothesize that in both datasets, proportion of CT will be higher in MI than HE and that
LT will be higher in HE than in MI. Aim 2 is to examine the relationship between proportion of CT to ST and
proportion of LT to RT and 3- and 6- month treatment outcomes in the community sample. We hypothesize
that that a higher proportion of CT relative to ST will be positively associated with treatment outcomes, both in
MI and HE; that a higher proportion of LT relative to RT will be positively associated with outcomes, both in MI
and HE; and that both high CT and high LT in the same session will be associated with improved outcomes
relative to either high CT alone or ST alone irrespective of treatment group. We also hypothesize that
proportion of CT will mediate treatment effects in MI, and proportion of LT will mediate treatment effects in HE.
Aim 3 is to use results to develop a brief manual for Veteran smokers incorporating HE and MI. Methodology:
We will use mixed methods to code and analyze 102 MI and 102 HE sessions from the community RCT and
15 MI and 15 HE sessions from the VHA RCT. To code sessions, we will use the Motivational Interviewing Skill
Code 2.5 (MISC 2.5), a validated MI client language measure, to code CT and ST; and a LT coding extension
system of the MISC 2.5 developed by our team to quantify client language LT, or reflective of client learning;
and client rejection of health information, or rejection talk (RT). We will use findings to develop a brief manual
for unmotivated Veteran smokers in VHA clinics. Throughout the project, we will work with an advisory panel of
Veteran stakeholders and VHA leaders, who will provide input on the manual. Implementation/Next Steps:
The ultimate goal of the project is to identify therapeutic mechanisms of action underlying MI and HE for
unmotivated smokers. Findings will allow our team to apply for funding to test a brief intervention incorporating
effective techniques from both HE and MI for unmotivated veteran smokers in VHA clinical settings."
11074816,"Targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with small molecules for imaging and therapy of
prostate cancer (PC) has revitalized the field of nuclear medicine. Few targets have its combination of salutary
attributes, namely, high concentration in malignant with restricted expression in normal tissues, easy access with
recycling to and from the plasma membrane, an enzymatic active site toward which small molecules of high
affinity and specificity can be designed, and biological relevance – an inverse relationship with androgen
signaling while being directly related to degree of malignancy. The ureas that we initially described for imaging
PSMA in 2002 have inspired a wide variety of cancer targeting species from radiotherapeutics to synthetic
antibody mimics. Our goal is to use what we have learned from PSMA-targeted detection, imaging and treatment
of PC to focus on highly aggressive disease, including that which does not express PSMA. We will deploy this
prolific cancer target here by beginning with a project that leverages the considerable clinical data obtained
during the last funding period to refine and simplify PSMA-targeted imaging with positron emission tomography
(PET) – in a way agnostic to imaging agent employed. Complementing PET we will explore sensitive new PSMA-
targeted agents and methods for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which can characterize primary disease in new
ways in an effort to uncover signatures that could separate aggressive from indolent cancer to prevent
unnecessary surgery and its attendant morbidity. Because PC is a heterogeneous disease, in the second half of
the project we will move from detection and characterization of PSMA-expressing PC to address highly
aggressive, PSMA-negative adenocarcinoma and especially neuroendocrine PC (NEPC), a lethal and
increasingly prevalent subtype with the proliferation of modern anti-androgen therapies. First, we will use a
PSMA reporter gene strategy to track NEPC-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in order to gauge
their spatial relationship to tumor, measure their expansion in vivo, and sense their microenvironment, with a
view to improving this case of solid tumor CAR T cell therapy. Finally, we will use cancer cell specific promoter
(CCSP) technology, which we developed for imaging and treating metastases, to enhance PSMA expression
specifically within NEPC tissue so that it may become susceptible to the detection and treatment of its PSMA-
expressing adenocarcinoma counterpart. In addition to using existing PSMA-targeted radiotherapy we will show
how a new urea-drug conjugate we have developed can kill NEPC once it is re-programmed to express PSMA.
To achieve these goals, we take the approach of beginning with a more sophisticated analysis of our clinical
PSMA PET data then work toward more laboratory-based imaging and therapeutic studies also designed for
translation. The team we have assembled is comprised of clinicians and scientists with a track record of high
productivity and impact working together."

11067170,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States alone, approximately 3.1 million adult patients suffer from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
a group of disorders characterized by chronic or recurring inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although
several therapeutics, including anti-TNF antibodies, have been approved for the treatment of IBD, many patients
do not respond to current treatments or experience relapse, highlighting an urgent need for the development of
more effective long-term therapies.
Antigen presenting cell (APC) dysfunction drives IBD initiation by encouraging a breakdown in intestinal
homeostasis and promoting pathogenic proinflammatory circuits against harmless commensal microbes.
Although APCs are considered critical to IBD pathogenesis, there have been no APC-targeted therapies
developed to date for the treatment of IBD. Qrono Inc is developing QR401, a first-in-class, oral, APC-specific
AMPK pathway agonist for the treatment of IBD. QR401 uses custom nanoparticles to directly promote an AMPK-
induced immunoregulatory APC phenotype. This work is inspired by studies demonstrating 1) that the AMPK
pathway is downregulated by intestinal APCs in IBD patients and 2) that activation of the AMPK pathway via oral
or systemic administration of AMPK pathway agonists can successfully alleviate disease severity in preclinical
mouse studies. While AMPK has long been a target of interest for IBD, clinical development of AMPK agonists
has been limited by severe adverse effects associated with systemic administration including metabolic
complications (i.e. lactic acidosis) and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, approaches like the one we propose that can
target AMPK agonists specifically to intestinal APCs are vital to safely activating the AMPK pathway that’s
dampened in IBD and restoring tolerance. Our preliminary data identify the AMPK agonist PF-739 as having
tolerogenic activity, marked by a dampening of pro-inflammatory IL-12p70 production coupled with a significant
increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion in LPS stimulated dendritic cells (DCs), features that promote Treg
induction. We hypothesize that targeting AMPK-activating compounds to APCs will decrease intestinal
inflammation during experimental colitis and human IBD without the metabolic and cardiac risks
historically associated with untargeted AMPK agonists. Accordingly, we will prepare and characterize
enteric-coated nanoparticles of PF-739 (QR401) that can be used for the proposed in vivo studies.
Successful completion of this project will establish proof-of-concept for a first-in-class APC-targeted
immunotherapy for IBD. A future Phase II STTR proposal would continue development in IND-enabling studies.
Qrono is committed to developing oral tolerogenic therapies for IBD, and these data will help us raise private
investment necessary for future clinical trials."
11068410,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 400 million adults worldwide are living with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite significant
advancements in effective treatments, T2D continues to rise at a concerning rate, and by 2035 it
is projected that there will be >590 million patients diagnosed globally with this condition- making it
one of the costliest chronic health conditions for patients and society. Glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor agonists (GLP- 1 RA) have revolutionized the treatment of T2D because they provide
substantial reductions in HbA1c as well as addressing the underlying metabolic dysfunction of
obesity that both can cause and complicate the management of diabetes. Regimens that
provide sustained plasma levels of GLP-1 RA provide optimal therapeutic effects and this has led
to the development of formulations and/or modifications of the native sequence aimed at
extending the peptide half-life. Semaglutide is a long acting GLP-1 analogue with low renal
clearance and a long elimination half-life. This is achieved by engineering the peptide to avoid
renal clearance and enzymatic degradation. While these modifications have reduced treatment
frequency from daily to weekly, poor adherence linked to perceived treatment complexity and
needle fear remains a general problem. These barriers highlight the critical need for new modes
of GLP-1 RA delivery. This proposal seeks to address these limitations by exploring use of the
MIMIXTM platform to enable simple and effective GLP-1 RA delivery. The MIMIX platform is a
clinically demonstrated, novel microneedle array patch (MAP) characterized by slowly dissolving
microneedle tips that ‘deploy’ into the dermis following patch application. The platform further
utilizes novel excipients such as silk fibroin to stabilize and support sustained release of
therapeutics and vaccines from the deployed tips. The shelf stability achieved with this platform
could enable MIMIX devices to be shipped through standard mail to enable self-application. The
potential for a sustained release formulation could reduce treatment frequency. Additionally, the
MIMIX MAP is delivered using a spring-loaded applicator, a feature that will simplify perception of
treatment complexity. In sum, we hypothesize that the MIMIX platform can be a new mode of
GLP-1 RA delivery that is 1) needle free to address the treatment hesitancy associated with
needle avoidance 2) shelf stable to facilitate home delivery and storage and 3) applied with a
spring-loaded applicator to enable self-application. These features will enhance the patient
experience and help to improve adherence to treatment. Our preliminary work has demonstrated
good compatibility of the GLP-1 RA, semaglutide, with the MIMIX production process. Successful
completion of the activities in this proposal will build on these results and will form the initial steps
towards identification of lead candidates for further development with the ultimate goal of
developing a product that reduces the global burden of T2D and obesity."
11073270,"The objective of this proposal is to determine how high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysregulation links obesity
with increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Epidemiologic studies have confirmed that obesity increases the risk
and mortality of BC, but the molecular mechanisms of obesity/breast cancer associations remain largely
unknown. Our recent studies demonstrate that lipid chaperone A-FABP (adipose fatty acid binding protein, also
known as FABP4) promotes obesity-associated BC by intracellular regulating pro-tumor activity in tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) and extracellular enhancing aggressive phenotype of BC cells. Thus, A-
FABP might represent a new factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism with obesity/BC risk. Moreover, we
observed that obesity can be induced by consumption of different types of HFDs, including saturated fats (e.g.
cocoa butter) or unsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil, fish oil). However, only cocoa butter HFD-induced obesity was
associated with increased A-FABP expression and mammary tumor growth. These observations suggest a
novel concept that not all HFD-induced obesity is tumorigenic. Given the undefined links underlying obesity-
induced BC risk, we hypothesized that HFDs rich in saturated fats promote BC risk through A-FABP-mediated
immune and metabolic regulations. As such, A-FABP offers a novel therapeutic target and biomarker for
obesity-associated BC risk. Three complementary but independent specific aims are designed to address our
central hypothesis. Aim 1 is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which different HFDs upregulate A-
FABP for BC risk. We will identify which HFDs promote mammary tumor risk and further dissect how the “bad”
fat drives intracellular A-FABP expression in TAMs and promotes extracellular A-FABP secretion from
adipocytes. Aim 2 is to delineate the downstream metabolic mechanisms of HFD-upregulated A-FABP in BC
risk and immunotherapy. We will delineate how intracellular A-FABP in TAMs regulates the FA oxidation
(FAO)/HIF2α/PD-L1 pathway for immune suppressive function, followed by delineation of how extracellular A-
FABP reprograms lipid metabolic profile in BC cells to enhance their aggressive phenotype. We will further
evaluate if blocking A-FABP activity with our unique humanized antibodies improves A-FABP-induced
metabolic dysregulation and reduces obesity/BC risk. Aim 3 is to evaluate A-FABP as a biomarker for obesity-
associated BC in humans. We will determine the function of A-FABP in peripheral monocytes and measure the
levels of soluble A-FABP in serum and A-FABP expression in tumor stroma using specimens collected from
lean and obese women with or without BC. Successful completion of this proposal will determine the “bad
HFDs” in promoting BC risk and identify the molecular and metabolic mechanisms by which A-FABP mediates
the pro-tumorigenic activities in HFD-induced obesity/BC risk."
11072334,"Project Summary/Abstract
Technologies for capturing multi-faceted neural signals underlying brain communication stand to improve our
understanding of these complex pathways, which can be leveraged to better diagnose and treat neurological
disorders and diseases. Such signals may be electrical or chemical in nature, originate in single neurons and
propagate through entire networks, and occur on sub-millisecond timescales yet persist for days to weeks. To
maximize downstream clinical impact, effective neuromonitoring tools should offer multimodal sensing and stim-
ulation capabilities with high spatiotemporal resolution, while chronically recording from large neuronal popula-
tions, and minimally perturbing animal physiology and behavior.
This proposal seeks to fulfill these needs by equipping thin, polymer-based multifunctional fibers with optical
imaging capabilities and coupling them to wireless recording devices. Existing endoscopic optical imaging tools,
which use implanted lenses to visualize neural activity via genetically-encoded fluorescent indicators, can record
from greater numbers of spatially-distinct neurons than electrophysiological methods, and detect complementary
information to neuronal firing, such as neurotransmitter release. However, these tools lack direct electrical and
chemical stimulation and recording abilities, and may provoke foreign body response, limiting long-term use in
vivo, especially in deep brain circuits. Alternatively, multifunctional fibers for electrical, chemical, and optical
interrogation of localized brain regions exhibit stronger materials compatibility with tissue due to their softer sub-
strates and smaller diameters, enabling chronic usage. Although these devices have previously only offered
opportunities for bulk optical recordings, this work will integrate polymer fiber waveguide bundles to achieve
spatially-resolved images, while preserving small device footprint, low stiffness, and multifunctionality. We will
leverage light field signal processing to transform fiber bundle images into 3D volumes, captured by a head-
mounted device featuring hardware for dual-wavelength imaging and fully wireless data transmission and real-
time control. We will deploy our fully-untethered devices to study firing and neurotransmitter dynamics in re-
sponse to social interactions in the mesolimbic pathway, a deep brain circuit implicated in stress, motivation, and
social dysfunction. These experiments will highlight our ability to complementarily expand the aspects of neural
activity able to be captured, as well as the experimental paradigms under which such recordings are feasible.
This work will benefit strongly from the multidisciplinary training environment at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology through access to key technical resources provided by the Materials Science, Electrical Engineering,
and Brain and Cognitive Science departments, which will be critical to developing the proposed devices. Addi-
tional intellectual and career development resources offered by mentored and independent training programs
will further strengthen technical foundations and offer necessary preparation for future independence in this field."

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a mechanical disorder that impacts up to 10% of the population at 
birth, but given a lack of knowledge to inform research and treatment, can result in a lifetime of painful and 
costly biomechanical problems and osteoarthritis. Improving treatment depends on understanding how a baby 
interacts with the Pavlik harness mechanical therapy brace at home, yet no research tools exist that allow for 
such measurements. The purpose of this project is to develop and validate a “smart” harness to enable at 
home research relating to how babies being treated for DDH interact with the brace. We will (Aim 1) Develop 
sensors to measure biomechanics within the Pavlik harness, (Aim 2) Embed sensors onto the Pavlik harness 
and validate via in vitro testing, and (Aim 3) Validate the smart harness with in vivo human subjects testing. 
The smart harness developed in this study will provide a proof-of-concept research device on which we can 
design future research and clinical studies to monitor the wear time, body position, and kicking data of babies 
undergoing DDH treatment, resulting in a more thorough understanding of these modifiable factors on clinical

sensors into a therapy device for biomedical applications. The Fabrication, Characterization, and Testing 
Research Core is critical to the success of this project. Specifically, I will use the advanced manufacturing 
capabilities and equipment to develop new flexible sensor types in Aim 1. The ElectroForce mechanical testing 
machine will be required to validate the kicking data from sensors in Aim 2. The 3D scanner will be required to 
develop computer models of the smart harness in Aim 3 and will be necessary for future computational 
analysis of the completed device."

 Type I interferons (IFN-Is) have well-documented potent antiviral and inflammatory properties. However,
we and others have shown that the inflammatory effects of these cytokines can have detrimental effects on
human health. Disorders caused by the prolonged effects of IFN-Is are collectively known as type I
interferonopathies. Mendelian type I interferonopathies, such as Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) and
spondyloenchondromatosis (SPENCD) are prime examples of severe neurologic, autoinflammatory and
autoimmune diseases caused by the perpetual induction of IFN-Is.
 We have recently described more than 20 children presenting Mendelian type I interferonopathy.
Genetically, we have shown these conditions to be due to complete or partial deficiencies of ISG15 or USP18.
These deficiencies affect downregulation of the IFN-I response. Individuals with deficiencies of ISG15 or USP18
have high levels of IFN-I-stimulated gene products in their blood cells, high levels of resistance to viral infections,
but also neurologic, autoinflammatory and autoimmune manifestations, akin to those of AGS and SPENCD. This
proposal is built around the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of these deficiencies is driven by IFN-I responses
in specific tissues, and that these responses could be harnessed in the development of new treatments. We plan
to test this hypothesis by studying these deficiencies in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo at the molecular, immunological,
and tissue-specific levels, to determine their functional significance in IFN-I pathway regulation and resistance
to viral infections in humans.
 Improvements in our understanding of the molecular regulation of IFN-I should shed light on the
pathophysiology of these deficiencies, paving the way for the development of new treatments for managing
persistent inflammatory disorders and enhancing antiviral responses."

The opioid epidemic is one of the major crises of our time, causing over 80,000 opioid-related overdose deaths
per year in the United States and levying massive economic burden on our healthcare system. More than half of
the ~2 million individuals suffering from OUD have co-occurring mental illness, and it is well-established that
depression during withdrawal is a major cause of relapse. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to better address
depression associated with OUD are desperately needed. 5HT2A agonists (e.g. lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
and psilocybin) showed therapeutic promise for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in early studies, but
research involving these psychedelic agents fell precipitously once they were categorized as Schedule I banned
substances in 1971. Although the benefits of 5HT2A agonists are being re-discovered – the FDA recently granted
“Breakthrough Therapy” designation to psilocybin in 2018 – patients must remain under observation with
psychological support during administration, and the therapeutic impact of a single dose eventually subsides. An
alternative treatment paradigm with promise of relieving mood disorder and lessening the likelihood of relapse
long-term is known as microdosing, where sub-perceptual doses of 5HT2A agonists are ingested every 3-7 days.
Those who microdose report a range of benefits including improved mood and decreased craving for addictive
substances, and scientifically rigorous trials and preclinical studies in animal models are beginning to corroborate
some, albeit not all, of the anecdotal claims. However, practical barriers such as low compliance, abuse and
diversion, access, medical cost, and placebo/expectancy effects from frequent interactions with the clinical staff
stymie further clinical investigation into this promising therapeutic modality. To overcome these practical
limitations, we have developed bioresorbable microdevices that deliver intermittent sub-perceptual 5HT2A agonist
microdoses. The innovation that makes intermittent microdosing possible is the use of a microfluidic “fuse"" that
creates a pre-programmed delay for the desired pulsatile release profile. The fuses are fabricated from surface-
eroding cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) and Pluronic® F-127 (P) polymer composites packed into
microchannels within a poly-𝜀-caprolactone (PCL) device body. A series of microfabricated drug reservoirs
beneath the CAPP fuse release their contents as the fuse dissolves. The current STTR proposal will move
these devices closer to clinical relevance by producing devices with highly tailored release profiles (Aim 1)
and demonstrating absorption and bioactivity of psilocybin upon release from the implants (Aim 2). Success of
this proposal will result in a disruptive new technology to enable microdosing as a therapeutic modality and offer
much-needed new options for patients suffering from OUD. After accomplishing our aims in Phase I, we will be
well-positioned to pursue efficacy and biocompatibility studies, perform pilot GMP manufacturing, and set a pre-
IND meeting with the FDA through the Phase II STTR/SBIR program."

Craniofacial morphogenesis involves a multitude of cell behaviors, including mesenchymal cell movements that
change the physical properties of tissues, culminating in changes in tissue shape. During secondary palate
morphogenesis the palatal shelves undergo a dramatic transformation in tissue shape that includes outgrowth,
extension, elevation, adhesion, and fusion to form a continuous structure. Cleft palate, occurring in 1:1500 live
births, can result from the failure of any step in this process, however, our understanding of the mesenchymal
cell behaviors that regulate tissue shape changes during secondary palate development is limited. My lab’s
previous research Indicates that Efnb1 is a key regulator of mesenchymal cell position and embryonic boundary
formation in multiple contexts, but how these changes cause a cleft palate phenotype is not clear. Our preliminary
data indicate that loss of function of the Shrm4 gene genetically interacts with Efnb1 loss, resulting in more
severe craniofacial dysmorphology and a dramatically increased incidence of cleft palate. This proposal aims to
establish the interplay between Efnb1 and Shrm4, and their impacts on the dynamic cell behaviors involved in
secondary palate tissue shape change. My proposal takes advantage of mouse genetics expertise in my sponsor
lab and three-dimensional imaging and quantitative analysis approaches that I have developed to understand
mesenchymal cell behaviors, as they relate to secondary palate shape change normally and upon loss of Efnb1.
I will test the hypothesis that EPHRIN-B1 and SHROOM4 regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton to control palatal
shelf shape change. Through these studies, I aim to improve understanding of the regulation of palatal outgrowth,
mesenchymal organization, and tissue shape during normal and cleft palate morphogenesis. This is highly
relevant to the etiology of CFNS, which is caused by mutations in the EFNB1 gene, and which includes cleft
palate in its spectrum."

The goal of this exploratory proposal is to deliver and express genetic material in the ferret model system early
in development. Our strategy is based on an existing method developed in mouse for the rapid and spatially
localized expression of DNA plasmids in postmitotic cells, a technique termed ‘iontoporation’. We aim to
express CRISPR/Cas9 into ferret primary visual cortex (V1) to manipulate the expression of specific genes
critical for the development and function of visual circuitry. Ferret is an ideal model system, as they are born
relatively immature and visual circuit development is well-characterized. In this application, we propose to
optimize and validate iontoporation in ferret to knockdown the expression of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptors (NMDARs) to elucidate their functional role in the formation and function of V1 circuitry. We will
validate the technique in vitro and in vivo, and start obtaining preliminary data for a collaborative R01, on the
role of NMDARs in the development and function of local and long-range (between columns) horizontal
connections in layers 2-3 of ferret V1. Successful development of this approach will open the door to genetic
manipulation in a higher mammal with cortical columnar organization of the neocortex similar to primates and
humans. It will also allow the development of genetic models of brain pathologies such as Schizophrenia."

We will characterize the interaction between TDP-43 and Tau by probing their binding using NMR and surface plasmon resonance. We will also test small molecules and peptides for their efficacy in mutilating or disrupting TDP-43/Tau interaction. Additionally, our study aims to determine the physiological and pathological consequences of TDP-43 and Tau interaction by examining phenotypes, behaviors, and cellular interactions using a humanized knock-in disease model in which normal aging and axonal injury will serve as the paradigm for examining lifespan changes that do not involve genetic overexpression or pharmacological initiation. The identification of binding partners and the role played by phosphorylation within the TDP-43/Tau protein-protein network will further expand our understanding of neurodegenerative disease development. The findings from this study will contribute to the development of novel therapeutics approaches targeting the interaction between TDP-43 and Tau spawning generation first-in-class therapeutics for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."
11079982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asthma progression is associated with reduced growth and an increased decline in lung function (LF) that is
thought to arise from a complex interplay of genes and environment. While several asthma genetic risk loci have
been identified to-date, an in-depth utilization of how environmental factors interact with these loci remains
limited. The methylome and the metabolome are both heavily influenced by the environment and recent studies
confirm a link between both omes. Integrating DNA methylation with the metabolome could be a powerful
approach to obtain converging evidence of specific pathways influencing asthmatic lung function trajectories at
the genome-wide level. While previous studies have investigated the role of the metabolome or methylome with
regard to lung function, none have investigated both “omes” simultaneously for lung function outcomes in
asthmatics. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that DNA methylation (CpG sites) plays a critical
role in modulating downstream metabolites and thus metabolic pathways, some of which may be driven
by an underlying genetic effect on lung function in children with asthma. We want to specifically investigate
multi-omic data from Wnt, Hippo and sphingolipid pathways, known to affect asthmatic lung function generally
and in our preliminary data. We capitalize on the genetic, methylomic and metabolomic data generated from
three large prospective childhood cohorts including two from the Trans-omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
consortium: Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and The Genetic Epidemiology of Asthma in
Costa Rica (GECRA) study and an independent cohort: The Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial
(VDAART). This study seeks to integrate multiple omics using innovative and state-of-the-art methodologies:
quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to identify genome-methylome associations with LF (Aim 1), QTL mapping
and causal inference testing to evaluate methylome-metabolome associations with LF (Aim 2), correlation-based
network methods to identify a highly correlated set of omic-driven biomarkers in dysregulated pathways (Aim 3).
Priyadarshini Kachroo, PhD, MS is a bioinformatician whose long-term career goal is to transition towards
becoming an independent data scientist with expertise in utilizing multi-omic approaches to complex disease
phenotypes. As Dr. Kachroo completes these aims, her career development plan will support her training goals:
1) deepen clinical understanding of asthmatic LF phenotypes; 2) expand on the statistical skills including causal
inference testing 3) develop skill-set of network methods for integrating multi-omic datasets 4) enhance skills in
study-design, mentorship and the ethics of scientific conduct and communication of research. Dr. Kachroo’s
strong quantitative and methodological background well position her to accomplish these goals, complete the

11080155,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there
are no open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and recording
available to researchers. As a result, progress towards bioelectronic clinical therapies is hampered by the
significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles faced by researchers to gain access to the few commercial
implantable neuromodulation technologies for early clinical studies. The few clinical closed-loop implantable
neuromodulation systems presently available are not suitable for the many bioelectronic medicine applications
envisioned, as they lack key functional modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, most use closed
architectures (e.g., the use of custom ASICs instead of commercial over-the-shelf components) and proprietary
software, limiting the ability to adapt such systems for different clinical indications.
 To address these shortcomings, the overall objective of this HORNET OpenNerve Platform project is to
develop and disseminate a fully open-architecture and open-source implantable system for autonomic nerve
stimulation and end-organ sensing. In this administrative supplement, we will perform short-term and long-term
validation of the OpenNerve Platform functionality in large animals for closed-loop sacral nerve stimulation for
treatment of chronic constipation. The OpenNerve Platform includes an external charger and controller,
implantable pulse generator, and an assortment of implantable leads for nerve stimulation and internal organ
sensing. The use of sacral nerve stimulation for treating chronic constipation was selected based on potential

11079992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Every day, ~350 patients die from lung cancer (LC) in the US, the majority from non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Treatment for NSCLC has advanced with precision medicine (PM)-guided use of oncogenic variants
and immune markers (PD-L1) to select targeted, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and antibody drug conjugate
(ADC) therapies. These treatments are validated in patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. Since current PDXs
develop in a murine immunodeficient microenvironment, and with more immune-mediated therapies advancing
to the clinics, there with is an urgent need to develop PDXs with an autologous human immune system (HIS),
where the tumors have a matching tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), for more predictive responses to
therapy. The establishment of an autologous HIS-PDX, with HLA-matched tumor, immune, and developmentally
mature cells is technically challenging for multiple reasons. For instance, reconstitution of an immunodeficient
mice with human blood cells results in T-cell activation and graft-versus-host-disease. Moreover, blood, bone
marrow, and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are difficult to acquire from cancer patients and generally have
low engraftment rates in immunodeficient mice. In contrast, blood or fibroblast cells from the same cancer patient
can be efficiently reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and these iPSCs are used to generate
an autologous HIS for engraftment in PDXs. Here, we propose to optimize the conditions for generating an iPSC-
derived HIS to mimic the natural T-cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo in a panel of autologous NSCLC PDX
models. We will utilize high-efficiency RNA-based reprogramming and organoid-based systems to assess the
key variables and optimize the conditions for cell induction, differentiation, expansion, and tolerance for the
generation of iPSC-derived-T-cells and myeloid cells, and the selection of the optimum timing and recipient
strains for the engraftment of autologous HIS in PDX models. We will develop novel NSCLC HIS-PDX models
with an autologous HIS, comprising iPSC-derived organoid-matured and thymic-educated polyclonal T-cells and
myeloid cells to test responses to ICIs. We will complete these studies with two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
generate NSCLC HIS-PDX models that harbor iPSC-derived, organoid-matured, and thymic-educated
autologous T-cells. We will assess the T-cell yield, engraftment, functional tolerance, and responses to ICIs. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the engraftment and functionality of myeloid cells in the same models and their impact
on immune responses to ICIs. We will work with the NCI Patient Derived Model Repository (PDMR) to utilize the
optimized conditions for generating HIS-PDX models that can be disseminated to the scientific community for
data cross-validation and to enhance model diversity for the evaluation of cancer immunotherapies. This
multifaceted translational collaboration is designed to share knowledge, specimens, models, and procedures, in
collaboration with PDMR, to develop HIS-PDX models for transforming immunotherapy and oncology research."

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal disease afflicting 1 in 4,000 people worldwide. The disease
progresses initially by rod photoreceptor degeneration caused by mutations in rod-specific genes, although
different mutations in different genes converge upon the same rod degeneration phenotype in this disease.
However, it is the subsequent cone photoreceptor degeneration that causes loss in daylight color vision and
ultimately, diminishing quality of life for most patients. While gene therapy to replace a mutated gene with a
functional copy has been successful, given the heterogeneity in mutations and genes, it is difficult to treat all RP
cases by targeting the rods. Instead, a generic therapy to preserve the cones upon rod degeneration may lead
to a more comprehensive therapeutic option. Despite progress, the molecular mechanism for this secondary
cone degeneration remains unclear. The goal of this proposed research is to determine whether the breakdown
of the Blood-Retina-Barrier (BRB) plays a causal role in non-cell-autonomous cone death in RP. During the
independent phase of this grant (R00 phase), we will explore the effect of removing the intra-retinal vasculature
on cone survival (Aim 1) and identify the foreign protein and cells that infiltrate the retina upon BRB breakdown
(Aim 2). Completion of the proposed aims will lead to the identification of key regulators of cone survival in mouse
models of RP. Moreover, we may identify, for the first time, a causal relationship between BRB breakdown and
secondary cone death, opening new cellular targets to prevent cone loss in patients with RP. Long-term, the
approaches outlined in this grant can become the cornerstone for answering questions regarding how, in general,
neurons and other supporting cells degenerate in neurodegenerative disorders across the central nervous
system. The rigorous scientific training received during the K99 phase in the Cepko Lab at Harvard Medical
School built a strong foundation for an independent career investigating the molecular mechanisms of retinal
degeneration."

Water insecurity (WI) is a major challenge in sub-Sharan Africa (SSA), where the number of people living with
HIV (PLWH) is disproportionately higher, and where populations are most likely to bear the impact of climate
change. The effects of water insecurity on health are well-documented in SSA: emotional distress is associated
with lack of safe water, including fear of contamination, worry over safety, and anxiety, increased migration and
thus HIV risk, as well as disruptions to health, care engagement, livelihoods, and relationships. Further, the
prevalence of WI among PLWH is high, and household WI and food insecurity (FI) lead to poor mental and
physical health. WI is also an important determinant of FI, suggesting multiple causal pathways to poor health
outcomes. While SSA least contributes to global warming, especially as compared to more industrialized
nations, it is expected to be amongst the hardest by climate change. Water is required for food production and
preparation8, and WI may directly and indirectly influence health outcomes by impacting FI and health. Among
PLWH, WI can lead to dehydration and undermine PLWH’s ability to manage unpleasant side effects
associated with ART, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In Ghana, one of the most vulnerable countries
to climate change in SSA, flooding affects around 45,000 Ghanaians annually while nearly half of Ghana’s
coastline is vulnerable to erosion and flooding as a result of sea-level rise and atypical rainfall. Further, an
estimated 70% of all disease burden in Ghana is attributed to WI. To effectively intervene, a deeper
understanding of the drivers of and sequelae of WI is critical. Therefore, we propose the first longitudinal
convergent mixed-methods study to quantify and elucidate the impact of WI on HIV, related to climate-related
drivers, infrastructure challenges, water accessibility, and heightened risk of water-borne diseases, to inform
interventions to address WI among PLWH. In Aim 1, we will utilize innovative remote sensing technologies to
investigate the role of climate-sensitive patterns (droughts, precipitation anomalies, and floods, capitalizing on
state-of-the-art satellite technologies) and seasonality on WI in Ghana. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact
of WI on HIV treatment outcomes (ART adherence/viral suppression) and opportunistic infections and
comorbidities, and the mechanisms through which WI may influence these outcomes (nutritional, mental
health, water, hygiene and sanitation, and empowerment pathways). In aim 3, using intervention mapping
framework, we will develop intervention options to mitigate WI and improve health for PLWH, synthesized from
theory and literature. Findings from this R01 will a) provide initial data on the drivers of and sequelae of WI and
it impact on HIV treatment outcome; b) guide the integration of HIV and water access programs; and c) help
identify and prioritize intervention development to address WI among PLWH."

High grade gliomas (pHGGs) represent the greatest number of solid tumors in the pediatric population, and now
are the greatest cancer related cause of death. Within the past 20 years, treatment progress has remained
stagnant, as 5-year survival rates remain less than 20%. Ras signaling has been shown to be highly upregulated
in many pHGGs, although Ras mutations are very rare. The role of negative regulators of Ras signaling, Ras
GAPs, in pHGGs remain vastly understudied. We discovered that Neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) is a Ras GAP commonly
mutated in 10% or higher of pHGGs. Additionally, 1 in 3000 individuals per year are born with Neurofibromatosis
Type I, a tumor predisposition syndrome with somatic heterozygous NF1 mutation. These individuals are at
greater risk for developing a number of cancers, including brain tumors. We leveraged pHGG transcriptomic and
proteomic datasets and GSEA pathway analysis and identified that alterations in cellular metabolism correlate
with NF1 loss in pediatric high grade gliomas, specifically through vast changes in lipid content.
I hypothesize that NF1 is a critical regulator of lipid metabolism, and that metabolic intervention could be used
to treat NF1 driven gliomas. My goal during the remainder of my graduate training (F99 phase) is to elucidate
how NF1 loss alters fatty acid/lipid metabolism, and whether targeting this phenotype in pHGG models is
efficacious. Upon finishing my graduate training, I will identify a post-doctoral mentor (K00) and further
investigate the metabolic roles of NF1 on brain tumor epigenetics. The proposed project leverages in vitro and
in vivo systems to study a distinct metabolic phenotype at the cellular and tumor levels. Our research will inform
a molecular mechanism and translational relevance for a role of NF1 in lipid metabolism. This data could also
be applicable to other cancer types and tumor predisposition syndromes. Combined together, the two phases of
this award will provide me with the means to establish myself as a successful cancer researcher and enable
me to lay the foundation for my own independent cancer research laboratory predicated on intertwined
study of brain tumor biology, neuroscience, and metabolism."

information dissemination.
The NARMS LABSuite portal capabilities would include customized working groups, web-
based proﬁciency testing registration and management, and tools that support secure
information sharing among animal and human health, retail foods, veterinary diagnostic
and other stakeholders. Collectively, the LabSUITE & GovSuite combined platform tools is
a sustainable model built and operationalized for secure communication, coordination,

nation's critical infrastructures such as food and agriculture. This proposal focuses on two
main objectives:
· Develop tools that advance the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring
System (NARMS) laboratories’ capacity to respond events through eUicient online
 data capture and management of laboratory capabilities and proﬁciency testing
results.
· Facilitate secure information sharing and communication for enhanced animal and
 public health.
LabSUITE tools allow professionals working in diUerent organizations (e.g. government,
academia) to work together on essential missions and responsibilities despite diUerences
in authorities, objectives, and roles. This robust platform connects the community
stakeholders to a centralized online environment and houses databases of current
information related to the mission of the NARMS to include but not limited to laboratory
testing protocols, facilities, equipment and professional expertise and contacts. Current
LabSUITE Information Sharing Environments (ISEs) include the Food Emergency Response
Network (FERN- https://www.fernlab.org) and the APHIS Laboratory Portal
(https://www.nahln.org), formerly called the National Animal Laboratory Network Portal,

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) consisting of cyanobacterial species have been increasing in waterways in the
United States and elsewhere due to the impacts of pollution and climate change. Cyanobacteria produce a
number of cyanotoxins, the most common of which are microcystin-LR and related microcystins, which are
potent hepatotoxins. Microcystins are known to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms, some of which are part of
the human food chain. While commercial ELISA kits are available to screen water samples for microcystins
and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) methods have been developed to quantitate
microcystin in water, there has been limited research on detecting or quantitating microcystins and their
metabolites in biological matrices. Some studies have attempted to use commercial ELISA kits developed to
screen water samples to screen samples of fish meat, but these methods have not been thoroughly validated.
We will develop and validate a robust quantitative LC/MS method to quantitate microcystin in fish, other animal

Alcohol Use Disorder is a chronic condition that can result in devastating health, social, and financial
outcomes. A key characteristic of problematic alcohol drinking is continued use despite negative
consequences. In punished alcohol seeking models, subjects must decide between drinking paired with an
aversive punishment or abstaining from further drinking. Preliminary evidence suggests that subjects
resistant to punishment show similar baseline drinking behaviors as subjects that are sensitive to
punishment. Thus, a potential behavioral impairment in aversion resistant subjects compared to their
aversion sensitive counterparts could lie in how resistant subjects update the outcomes, or contingencies,
of their actions. Recent evidence from pharmacological inactivation and ex-vivo slice studies points to the
role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in mediating aversion resistance. Interestingly, the OFC has also
been widely investigated for its role in updating outcome contingencies. However, how contingency
updating processes may contribute to punished alcohol seeking behaviors has yet to be elucidated. In my
first aim, I seek to evaluate the effects of punished alcohol seeking on OFC activity using microendoscopic
calcium imaging. In my second aim, I will use time-locked optogenetics to assess the effects of OFC
activation and inhibition during punished alcohol self-administration. In my third aim, I will evaluate how
rats classified as aversion sensitive or aversion resistant perform on reversal learning tasks used to
assess outcome updating. The central goal of this work is to investigate if dysregulation in OFC activity as
well as impairments in contingency updating contribute to individual differences in punished alcohol
seeking. The findings of the proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of the
neurobiological and behavioral contributions in drinking despite negative consequences."

The research we propose in this application seeks to translate our recent understanding of the
neuroprotective mechanism associated with the human apolipoprotein E2 (ApoE2) genotype into a
therapeutic opportunity to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The overarching hypotheses
are that introduction of human ApoE2 protein into high-risk ApoE4 and AD brains positively alters the
course of brain aging or disease pathogenesis by bolstering brain resilience through enhanced
glycolytic metabolism, which subsequently improves glucose utilization, protein homeostasis, and
synaptic activity. In preparation, we have achieved three major milestones critical to the success of
this translational endeavor: (1) development of a method for the production of physiologically relevant
and human-compatible recombinant ApoE2 (rhApoE2) glycoprotein that possesses biological
functionality comparable to endogenous human ApoE2; (2) development of a noninvasive approach
for brain delivery of rhApoE2 glycoprotein via modulation of cadherin interactions on the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), which induces neuroprotective signaling in ApoE4 brains; and (3) development of novel
humanized knock-in mouse models that respectively target human sporadic (sAD) and familial AD
(fAD), which are expected to provide high predictive validity for translating bench successes to
bedside. The proposed studies will pursue three specific aims. Building on our initial success, the
objective of the first aim is to determine the therapeutically optimal regimen for delivery of rhApoE2
glycoprotein that will result in deposition of rhApoE2 throughout cortical and hippocampal regions and
upregulation of brain glycolytic metabolism without eliciting adverse reactions. The objective of the
second aim is to evaluate the therapeutic impact of rhApoE2 delivery, in combination with age and
sex, on brain changes associated with sAD in humanized mouse models that express physiological
levels of human ApoE3 or ApoE4 and human wild-type APP proteins. The third aim will be
investigated in humanized mouse models that express physiological levels of human ApoE3 or ApoE4
and human mutant APP proteins to evaluate the therapeutic impact of rhApoE2 delivery on brain
changes associated with fAD, and how the rhApoE2-mediated effects are modified by a combination
of age, sex, ApoE genotype, and disease status. Our overall goals for the proposed research are to
establish the plausibility of targeting brain metabolic resilience as a disease-modifying strategy and
generate proof of concept as to whether a rhApoE2-based protein therapy can potentially be
developed into an effective and safe intervention for AD."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-

racial/ethnic groups of women in the United States. Adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) (e.g.,
structural racism) are documented sources of racial disparities in breast cancer. However, research studies
examining the mechanistic pathways of these associations and those examining within-group differences among
Black women are lacking. This study seeks to overcome these limitations of current research by examining the
extent to which SDoH measures are associated with inflammatory biomarkers among Black women. We will
recruit a socio-demographically heterogeneous sample of Black breast cancer survivors from Maryland.
Participants will provide survey data, blood samples, and qualitative data. Integrating these data, we will assess
associations and generate new hypotheses about the influence of adverse SDoH on breast cancer among Black
women. In Aim 1 of the study, we will examine associations between SDoH, patient-reported outcomes, and
inflammation-related protein biomarkers in a sample of 100 socio-demographically diverse Black BC survivors.
We will employ statistical and laboratory analyses to examine associations of SDoH measures and health-related
quality of life with inflammatory biomarkers overall and explore stratifications by measures of individual
socioeconomic position. In Aim 2 of the study, we will conduct eight focus groups with a subset of participants
from Aim 1. Focus groups will be homogeneous by age group and area of residence to more comprehensively
understand within-group lived experiences related to SDoH and breast cancer. We will integrate qualitative
analyses with findings from Aim 1 using a mixed methods analytic approach. The study is strongly aligned with
NOT-CA-24-032 and with the priorities of the parent grant (P30CA006973). Findings will provide insight into how
social factors can impact inflammation and cancer outcomes in varied socio-demographic subgroups of Black
women."

Longevity studies in mice are expensive and time-consuming, and there are currently no
measures that can predict mortality in a mouse at an earlier time-point. Additionally, there are
very few measures of the overall health of mice that can be assessed longitudinally. In
humans, frailty can predict mortality with greater power than the DNA methylation clock. In my
early postdoctoral work I have validated a mouse frailty index, that increases with age, is
associated with mortality and age-related pathologies, and is sensitive to interventions. In the
Sinclair lab I have used machine learning modelling of this mouse frailty index to make the
Analysis of Frailty in Death (AFRAID) clock that can predict the lifespan of male C57BL/6 mice
aged 21 months or older with accuracy of approximately 1.7 months. We hypothesis that a
frailty clock that includes a range of measures including physiological and molecular measures
(blood-based Analysis of Frailty in Death, bAFRAID) will accurately predict lifespan in younger,
female mice of a different strain. To test this hypothesis I will complete a battery of health
assessments, including blood collection for novel peptide biomarker detection, in male and
female UM-HET3 mice every 3 months from 15 months of age until death. I will use regression
modelling of all measured outcomes to develop an optimized `bAFRAID clock' that predicts
time to death in mice. I will complete this part of the project at Harvard Medical School in the
lab of Dr David Sinclair, who will act as my mentor and is an internationally recognised expert
in the biology of aging. I will receive additional training in biomarker modelling and peptidomics
from experts Drs Steve Horvath and Steve Gygi. For the independent phase of this award, I
will use longitudinal assessments, and cutting-edge epigenetic tools to investigate the
relationship between epigenetic changes and the AFRAID clock. This will increase our
understanding of whether epigenetic mechanisms underly the onset of frailty in aging. The
completion of this project and the proposed training will position me in an ideal position to
achieve my career goal of becoming an independent researcher with a lab focused on
understanding the mechanisms of frailty in aging."

emerged as key modulators of reward learning, and potential therapeutic targets for addressing addiction,
depression, and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have shown that GABA neurons in the VTA
undergo a form of experience-dependent plasticity that involves the downregulation of the anion transporter,
KCC2. This reduction of KCC2 levels has been found to increase the excitability of GABA neurons by
decreasing the efficacy of GABAA receptor function. In the context of drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, this
mechanism has been studied in great detail. However, the impact of this mechanism on specific reward-related
pathways and its contribution to naturalistic reward learning remains unknown.
 In my thesis work thus far, I have examined whether modifications in KCC2 serve as an innate
mechanism during reward learning that allows the brain to establish enduring associations between
contextual cues and appetitive stimuli. I first characterized the expression of KCC2 throughout the course of
cue-reward associative learning and showed that KCC2 downregulation shifts VTA GABA neurons towards
excitability at critical time points during reward learning. My data also demonstrate that KCC2-mediated
plasticity drives increased synchronized activity between VTA GABA neurons ex vivo. Subsequently, I
demonstrate that VTA GABA neurons exhibit enhanced synchronization in vivo, and it is concurrent with the
same time points when KCC2 downregulation occurs.
 This F99/K00 proposal comprises two aims outlined in the following research plan. In Aim 1, I will
examine whether this form of plasticity occurs in vivo, and consequently leads to enhanced synchronized
network activity. To achieve this, I will combine multi-unit silicon recordings with pharmacological and genetic
approaches to manipulate levels of KCC2 and examine neural network dynamics during reward learning. Aim 2
delineates my aspirations to identify and obtain a postdoctoral position. During the K00 phase, I plan to
investigate the molecular, cellular, and neurocircuit-specific mechanisms shaping susceptibility or
resilience to common neuropsychiatric disorders. To this end, my sponsors and I have crafted a thorough
plan for my F99 (predoctoral) and K00 (postdoctoral) phases. The F99/K00 will support my goals for becoming
an independent researcher by facilitating the successful completion of my PhD and bolstering a seamless
transition into a strong postdoctoral position."

11075494,"Metformin is prescribed to 50 million Americans annually, and is currently in widespread perinatal (pre-pregnancy,
during pregnancy, and post-natal) clinical use. Over the past decade, clinical indications and pragmatic use of metformin
have steadily expanded beyond the treatment of overt diabetes outside of pregnancy, and now include prediabetes and
obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. With its expanded use, questions of
unintended long-term harm have arisen. The rationale underlying these concerns for metformin exposure during
development as a consequence of expanded maternal use arises from its basic pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of
action, which we and others hypothesize converge to disrupt important metabolic pathways during fetal life, which are
necessary to establish normal birth weight and appropriate early post-natal growth trajectory. When combined with a
maternal Western-style diet (WSD), fetal metformin exposure leads to accelerated early development of a pre-diabetic,
pre-obese phenotype with evidence of obesity and insulin resistance in early adolescence (puberty onset).
 We are inspired by our preliminary data to pursue development of a non-human primate model of maternal
metformin use. Powered as a three-armed mechanistic-based clinical study, we will determine the impact of metformin
or placebo exposure from pre-pregnancy through lactation on the development of obesity and insulin resistance. This
study is adequately powered to test the hypothesis that maternal metformin use in isolation or in conjunction with a
maternal high fat diet renders low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, driving obesity and insulin resistance in
the offspring by onset of puberty (approximately 3-4 years of age). In Aim 1, we will determine if early life metformin
exposure in control and/or WSD-fed dams leads to low birthweight and aberrant catch-up growth, resulting in obesity
and insulin resistance in pubertal juvenile offspring. In Aim 2, we will determine what the impact of metformin exposure
in WSD-fed dams is on maternal, fetal (G145) and juvenile (to puberty onset) metabolic physiology. This will include core
measures of maternal and fetal organ metabolism (liver, muscle, gut and pancreas). In Aim 3, we will determine
whether weaning offspring onto a control diet can ameliorate or mitigate the effects of maternal metformin exposure in
WSD-fed dams. Finally, in Aim 4 we will determine how early metformin exposure wields its molecular impact on control
and WSD-induced alterations of core measures of maternal and fetal metabolism in the liver, gut, muscle, and pancreas.
 Considering the recently emerged epidemiologic evidence and known mechanisms of actions of metformin, there is
a rational concern that rather than preventing developmental programming, metformin use during pregnancy may
have unintended consequences of accelerating obesity and the metabolic syndrome epidemic in the next generation.
The animal, specimen, and uniformly generated multi’omic data generated in the current proposal will collectively
inform ongoing clinical trials and future clinical implementation."
11077005,"Project Summary/Abstract
Concurrent nicotine use is highly implicated in the propensity to misuse prescribed opiates, future development
of opiate dependence, and susceptibility to accidental opiate overdose. Approximately 83-95% of patients
involved in opioid treatment programs are tobacco users. As such, there exists a clear public health mandate
for elucidation of mechanisms contributing to opiate addiction liability resultant from opiate and nicotine
polysubstance use. The anterior insular cortex is heavily involved in processing the interoceptive stimulus
properties of commonly abused drugs and insular dysfunction is implicated in the development and
maintenance of substance use disorders. The role of the insular cortex in opiate addiction, and furthermore,
how nicotine may play a role, is currently underexplored. There is emerging evidence that nicotine interferes
with insular function, specifically through depressing synaptic potentiation and inhibiting the output of the
insular cortex. Preliminary data demonstrate that nicotine delivered to the anterior insular cortex interferes with
the processing of the stimulus properties of opiates in a quantitative manner, an effect remarkably similar to
insular chemogenetic inactivation. Specifically, subjects either administered nicotine or undergoing
chemogenetic inactivation of the insular cortex behave as if they have received a lower dose of morphine
relative to controls in paradigms examining both the reinforcing (conditioned place preference; CPP) and
aversive (conditioned taste avoidance; CTA) stimulus properties of opiates. As a result, tobacco smokers may
require more and stronger doses of opiates in order to achieve the desired effects. This reduced sensitivity to
the stimulus properties of opiates due to nicotine co-use may facilitate the development of opiate dependence.
The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms and neural circuits through which insular cortical
nicotinic activity contributes to enhanced opiate addiction liability. These experiments will employ a
combination of psychophysical behavioral measures, site-specific behavioral pharmacology, circuit-specific
chemogenetic manipulation, and in vivo electrophysiology in order to fully characterize the mechanisms
through which insular cortical nicotinic activity may contribute to the development of opiate substance use
disorders. Furthermore, through completion of these proposed studies, the applicant will be competently
trained in new technical skills and perspectives, ultimately facilitating a successful transition to a principal
investigator conducting programmatic research on the comorbidity of nicotine and opiate abuse."

One in six children in the U.S. and Canada have one or more learning or behavioral problems, such as
learning disability, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, conduct disorder, depression, or attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Early brain development is sensitive to toxicant exposures, including heavy
metals, persistent organic pollutants, and endocrine disrupting chemicals. Exposure to mixtures of
environmental chemicals is a reality in children, and chemical mixtures may have different modes of action
affecting neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiations, synaptic formation/trimming/plasticity, myelination,
and neurotransmitters, resulting in adverse impact on the central nervous system. Majority of environmental
epidemiologic studies have only examined the impact of a single chemical on neurobehavioral outcomes.
Recent development and application of mixture statistical methods will provide great potential to reveal the
impact of an individual chemical, interactions between chemicals, and cumulative exposure. These methods
have only been applied in limited studies of child neurobehavior and none has been used for neuroimaging
outcomes. We will use two existing birth cohorts to examine the impact of both pre- and postnatal exposures to
chemical mixtures on child neurobehavior. The Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME)
Study is a Cincinnati-based birth cohort of 400 pregnant women with children followed up to age 12 years, and
the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) is a Canadian study of 1983 pregnant
women with children followed up to age 9-11 years. The two North American birth cohorts both measured over
60 environmental contaminants, including lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, polybrominated diphenyl ethers,
polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides,
bisphenol A, phthalates, triclosan, and organophosphate flame retardants, as well as child cognitive abilities
(n>1000), behavior (n>1000), and neuroimaging (n=390). We will utilize advanced statistical methods for
chemical mixtures, including Elastic Net (ENET) for variable selection, Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS)
regression for individual chemical effect estimation, and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) for
interactions, nonlinearities, and joint effects. This project will be among the first to test and quantify the
potential impact of prenatal and postnatal exposures to chemical mixtures on neurobehavioral and
neuroimaging outcomes in well-established cohorts. The results have the potential to greatly increase our
understanding of developmental neurotoxicity of chemical mixtures in children and affect environmental health
policy making."
11075519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With no effective treatments or cures, ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) present a pressing
threat to our society. Converging evidence links NDs to defects in endolysosomal trafficking, a vital cellular
process used by neurons to maintain their tidiness during normal aging. As one of the most extensively studied
NDs, autosomal dominant Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in
the coding region of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene that leads to an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in
the corresponding encoded HTT protein. This results in a dominant neurotoxicity and potential alterations of
HTT’s normal physiological functions that together lead to the selective loss of medium spiny and cortical
projection neurons in the brain. Interestingly, defective endolysosomal trafficking has been observed in HD, and
HTT itself has been implicated in endosomal pathways from many in vitro studies. However, whether and how
HTT functions in endolysosomal pathways in a physiologic condition remains unexplored. HTT forms a tight
complex with its cognate binding partner HAP40, both of which are conserved in the model organism Drosophila.
By characterizing these two genes in Drosophila, I found in vivo evidence that HAP40 controls HTT in regulating
the functional convergence of endolysosomal recycling and degradation. Together with other evidence, they led
to my central hypothesis that through HAP40, HTT regulates Rab4 and Rab4-mediated endolysosomal
trafficking, a cellular process potentially disrupted by polyQ expansion in HD. For the F99 dissertation stage, I
propose to elucidate the molecular mechanism and functional consequence of this novel HTT/HAP40-mediated
endosomal trafficking by harnessing the power of multiple complementary model systems, including genetics
and genomics in fruit flies, live/super-resolution imaging in mammalian cells, and brain structure and function
analysis in mice (Aim1). Results from this study will define a novel and conserved role of HTT in endolysosomal
processes, uncover its underlying mechanism, and its physiological importance. For the K00 post-doctoral stage,
I plan to continue this direction of research but expand my training to new technologies such as human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)/brain organoids that are more related to humans and with more direct translational
potential, complemented with more systematic training in mouse ND models, to study endolysosomal pathways
such as the Retromer complex that are implicated in more prevalent NDs including Parkinson’s (PD) and
Alzheimer’s (AD) diseases. My goals are to understand how endolysosomal pathways contribute to different NDs
and whether membrane trafficking pathways can be targeted as novel effective therapeutic avenue to treat NDs
(Aim2). For both the F99 and K00 stages, I plan to devote extensive effort towards research training and
professional development. Overall, the proposed study will elucidate the function, the mechanism, and the
disease relevance of HTT in endolysosomal trafficking, with potential to identify disease-modifying drugs for NDs,
while providing me with the necessary professional training to become an independent investigator."
11075533,"Project Summary/ Abstract
The researcher's central career goal is to become an independent researcher investigating disorders of
consciousness (DoC), with a specific emphasis on using non-invasive neurostimulation to restore accurate
conscious perception. Despite ongoing research efforts, gaps persist in the understanding of consciousness,
and recent findings suggest promising avenues for neurostimulation therapies. Aim 1 of the dissertation
research project involves utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain networks
associated with auditory perception without explicit reporting. The thesis work establishes a paradigm and
machine learning model that eliminates the need for explicit reporting, mitigating confounding signals related
to reporting. Preliminary data indicate success in inducing threshold-level perception, identifying eye metrics
specific to auditory conscious perception, and a successful machine learning model to predict auditory
perception based on eye tracking. Aim 1.2 will identify the neuronal activity associated with this more purified
measure of perception. Auditory conscious perception is hypothesized to involve three major brain networks
independent of task report: 1. Detection/arousal/salience networks, 2. Task-positive attention networks, and 3.
Default mode network. This work will improve our capacity to identify auditory perception in those who may
not be able to report their experiences and holds promise to help identify targets for neuromodulation to
improve disorders of consciousness.
Aim 2, the postdoctoral research direction, advances neuromodulation strategies for DoC. Current approaches
like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have limitations, and the
researcher proposes exploring transcranial, low-intensity, low-frequency focused ultrasound (tFUS) as a
potential solution. tFUS offers spatially precise neuromodulation of deep brain structures without surgery,
demonstrating safety and neuroactivity in animal models and healthy human volunteers. The plan is to
contribute to the broader field of neuromodulation research by advancing understanding of tFUS's modulatory
effects on neural networks associated with consciousness. Essential skills to be acquired include a
comprehensive understanding and practical skills related to tFUS technology and gaining clinical insight into
DoC and working with clinical populations. The training in both aims will significantly enhance the researcher's
proficiency in neuroimaging, machine learning, and neuromodulation approaches, laying a solid foundation for
future academic pursuits."

Anti-PD-1 antibody has been approved to treat distinct cancers including hepatocellular cancer (HCC); however,
the objective therapeutic response in human HCC patients is only about 14%. Microbes are now widely accepted
to play critical roles in cancer pathology, and targeting them to improve cancer treatment is an active research
area. To investigate the role of gut microbiota in HCC, a novel murine model was created which reflects the
typical features in human disease and expresses SV40 T antigen (TAg) as a trackable tumor specific antigen
(TSA). This model was used to study the influence of gut microbiota on HCC initiation and progression by treating
pre- or post-malignant mice with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) that contains three types of antibiotics. ABX
treatment restored TSA CD8+ T-cell function, retarded hepatocarcinogenesis, and therapeutically slowed HCC
growth. Metagenomic assay demonstrated ABX treatment mediated an enrichment of Bacteroides.
Supplementation of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B.th), one member of genus Bacteroides, acted similarly to
ABX in suppressing tumor growth and activating anti-tumor immune response, associating with the intratumoral
accumulation of CpG-rich genomic DNAs and increased expression of TLR9 in intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs)
and macrophages (MΦs). In particular, complete gut sterilization of HCC-bearing mice with five types of
antibiotics followed by B.th repopulation markedly improved the therapeutic efficacy of αPD1 Abs. Single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that B.th repopulation was associated with significant suppression of
Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and significant increase of TLR9. Previous studies have demonstrated that KLF2 is
a transcription factor which negatively controls expression of TLR9, phagocytosis in MФs and DCs, and function
of T cells. Together, these results imply that B.th suppresses KLF2 expression, which abrogates its suppressive
effect on TLR9, a pattern recognition receptor (PRR). The resultant increased TLR9 on sentinel MФs and DCs
recognizes B.th-derived CpG-rich DNAs in tumors to activate TSA effector CD8+ T cells against HCC. Thus, this
study will test the hypothesis that gut Bacteroides activate anti-HCC immune responses and improve anti-HCC
immunotherapy by modulating immunological function of DCs and MФs via KLF2/TLR9/CpG molecular
pathways. Aim 1 will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which B.th modulates DCs and MΦs to improve anti-
HCC immunity and therapeutic effect through KLF2 and TLR9 pathways; aim 2 will dissect the cellular
mechanisms by which B.th modulates DCs and MΦs to improve anti-HCC immunity and therapeutic effect; and
aim 3 will investigate therapeutic and immune regulatory effect of gut microbiota in human HCC patient response
to αPD-1 Ab treatment. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide insight into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying B.th-activated anti-HCC immune response and advance gut microbiota-
integrated immunotherapy to clinical application."

The low to moderate success with childhood obesity interventions to date and the persistent obesity disparities
across race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status indicate the need to approach childhood obesity in a new and
innovative way. Building on the last three decades of research on childhood obesity, the main objective of the
proposed study is to utilize state-of-the-art intervention methods including ecological momentary intervention
(EMI), video feedback, and home visiting methods in partnership with primary care clinics and Community
Health Workers (CHWs) to examine whether increasing the quality of family meals (i.e., dietary quality,
interpersonal atmosphere) and quantity of family meals (i.e., frequency of meals) reduces childhood obesity.
Numerous studies have shown significant associations between family meal frequency and child weight and
weight-related behaviors (e.g., better diet quality, lower weight status). Research has also shown that the
quality of family meals, including dietary quality of the food served at family meals and the interpersonal
atmosphere during family meals, is associated with decreased childhood obesity risk. In addition, prior
intervention research has shown that immediate feedback on health behaviors (e.g., EMI, video feedback)
increases the likelihood of behavior change. Thus, the proposed individual randomized controlled effectiveness
trial, based on our pilot study, tests combinations of the above factors (i.e., EMI, home visiting, video feedback)
across three study arms: (1) EMI; (2) EMI+Home Visiting (HV); and (3) EMI+HV+Video Feedback. All arms will
receive 16 weeks of EMI family meal tip messages delivered via smartphones. Arms 2 and 3 will additionally
receive home visiting (eight in-home visits; eight “Try it Yourself” activities) focused on family meal quality and
quantity and a family meal prep activity delivered by a CHW simultaneously with the 16 weeks of EMI. Arm 3
will additionally receive eight weeks of video feedback focused on family meal behavior(s)/patterns delivered
by a CHW during the eight in-home visits. All arms will receive an 8-week maintenance phase allowing for
progressively less support of families so they can increase self-efficacy and sustainability of behavior change.
The intervention will be carried out for 6 months with children with overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI ≥85%ile) who
are ages 5-8 years (n=510), from low income and diverse households (i.e., African American, Hispanic, Native
American, White), and their families. Eligible children will be recruited through primary care clinics. Drawing on
Family Systems Theory, the intervention aims to change individual and family-level behaviors. Specifically, the
intervention will be delivered to the family unit and primary outcomes will include child weight (i.e., BMI %ile)
and diet quality (i.e., Healthy Eating Index). Secondary outcomes will include parent and other family member’s
weight and weight-related behaviors. This study will change clinical practice by creating a new model for
childhood obesity treatment in primary care using CHWs as interventionists and mobile health technology to
intervene in real-time on parental stress and the home food environment to reduce childhood obesity."

 The successful application of magnification devices for reading and daily tasks is predicated on their correct
use by individuals with low vision (LV). Barriers related to transportation, geography, and/or health-related
concerns often limit LV patients’ ability to attend several in-office training sessions as part of LV rehabilitation
(LVR) to optimize visual function with magnification devices. A promising solution is real-time videoconferencing
to provide telerehabilitation, involving remotely delivered LVR services by a LVR provider in-office to a patient at
home. Telerehabilitation for LV appears to be feasible and acceptable by both patients and LVR providers, with
preliminary evidence that its efficacy for enhancing reading ability may be similar to in-office LVR. However, it
has not yet been fully demonstrated whether telerehabilitation is at least as effective as in-office usual care for
LV follow-ups. This would be critical information to reassure LV providers that either modality is acceptable.
 This NIH Diversity Supplement aims to provide a clinical research experience with related training for the
candidate with a doctorate in occupational therapy to become involved in the non-inferiority trial that we are
conducting. The primary goal of the non-inferiority trial is to determine the potential for telerehabilitation to
enhance visual ability by providing remotely-delivered LVR training to use magnification devices and/or visual
assistive mobile apps in comparison to in-office usual care LVR. This will provide an evidence basis for whether
the effects of two interventions are not clinically and statistically different from each other. In addition to the
optimized task-specific training component of the non-inferiority trial, the Diversity Supplement aims to evaluate
how enhanced intervention approaches (i.e., habit training and motivational interviewing administered by the
candidate) in both telerehabilitation and in-office settings impact participants’ acceptability and utilization of LV
aids.
 Another aim in this NIH Diversity Supplement is to develop and implement a training protocol specifically for
visually impaired patients to improve their access to electronic health records and healthcare resources through
patient portals. We will evaluate the efficacy of the training provided by occupational therapists to enhance low
vision patients’ health literacy and independence with health management. This study will focus on the Epic
healthcare web-based and mobile app portals at ophthalmologic academic centers. We will evaluate visually
impaired patients’ proficiency with patient portal access and health literacy pre- and post-training, as well as
document any reoccurring barriers to accessibility. Based on our findings, we will develop and disseminate
deliverables to support patient portal access for low vision patients. We will collaborate with Epic IT leadership
by providing recommendations to resolve patient portal accessibility challenges and improve user experience
among low vision populations. We will also create resources (e.g., videos, guides) for low vision patients and
stakeholders to support training and access to electronic health records through patient portals."

Stress during adolescence is a significant risk factor for the development of numerous psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), in adulthood. Adolescence is a critical period of development for multiple neural systems in the brain, including the dopaminergic system. The dopaminergic system is crucial for reward-guided motivation, a process which is impaired in individuals with MDD. Clarifying how adolescent stress alters the dopaminergic system to impair reward-guided motivation in adulthood may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for MDD. Recent studies have shown that adolescent stress can alter population activity and synaptic plasticity of dopamine neurons in adulthood. Importantly, astrocytes regulate neuronal population activity throughout the brain and have recently been shown to modulate VTA dopamine neuron activity. Therefore, adolescent stress may impair reward-guided behaviors in adulthood by altering the activity dynamics of VTA astrocytes and dopamine neurons. The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate how adolescent stress alters the endogenous activity dynamics of VTA astrocytes and dopamine neurons to drive reward-related behavioral deficits in adulthood. In Aim 1, we will use cellular resolution microendoscopic calcium imaging to determine how adolescent stress alters the endogenous activity dynamics of VTA astrocytes and dopamine neurons during reward-guided operant conditioning in adulthood. In Aim 2, we will assess how chemogenetic modulation of VTA astrocytes alters the endogenous activity dynamics of VTA astrocytes and dopamine neurons to change reward-guided operant conditioning in mice exposed to adolescent stress. The results of these studies will provide the first characterization of the endogenous activity dynamics of VTA astrocytes and dopamine neurons during reward-guided behaviors and will provide a framework for understanding how adolescent stress influences astrocyte-dopamine neuron interactions to impair reward-related behaviors in adulthood. Under this award, the applicant will work with her mentorship team to develop technical skills in cellular resolution calcium imaging and chemogenetics. Moreover, the applicant will engage in professional development to hone her skills in leadership, mentorship, and teaching. Collectively, the training under this award will prepare the applicant to pursue an independent investigator position at a research-intensive institution."

 2 The Thiamine HPLC-FLD quantification project is proposed by the WADDL-ASL laboratories to
 3 fill the analytical gap in the Vet-LIRN network by developing a standardized HPLC-FLD
 4 (fluorescence) method to quantify the concentration of thiamine, thiamine
 5 pyrophosphate(diphosphate), and thiamine monophosphate in animal feeds, tissues, and blood
 6 that can be implemented by all in-network laboratories with HPLC-FLD capabilities. Thiamine is
 7 an essential vitamin that must be supplied in the diet of many animal species and severe
 8 disease can quickly develop in deficient diets. The current gold standard for diagnosis relies on
 9 recognition of clinical signs and response to treatment as thiamine testing in tissue and blood
10 samples is not readily available in veterinary diagnostic laboratories despite being routine in
11 human clinical laboratories. A method utilizing HPLC-FLD instrumentation will be extrapolated
12 from an HPLC method validated in fish tissues and roe into an HPLC-FLD method for increased
13 sensitivity and the matrices expanded to include animal and pet feed and animal (non-fish)
14 tissues (liver, brain, and muscle) and blood. A Level 2 FDA validation will be done in the lead
15 laboratory using prepared and verified homogeneous test materials including animal and pet
16 feed, animal tissues (liver, brain, and muscle), blood, and three species of fish roe. A Level 3
17 FDA validation will then be done by collaborators at the Cornell University Animal Health
18 Diagnostic Center and supply additional recommendations for optimization of the method. After
19 completion of the validation, the SOP for the Thiamine HPLC-FLD quantification method will be
20 made available to Vet-LIRN network laboratories and added to the literature in a peer-reviewed
21 journal. Oral and/or poster presentations at appropriate conferences will be made to increase
22 visibility and awareness of the new standardized SOP available for use and implementation.
23 Additionally, method development will be completed to expand the method to an HPLC-UV/VIS
24 to increase accessibility in Vet-LIRN laboratories without HPLC-FLD testing capabilities in case
25 of an event requiring significant surge analysis capacity."
11075621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since any antimicrobial drug use has the potential to increase resistance, a key goal is to align
antimicrobial drug use (AU) with the prescribing guidelines in veterinary settings. Awareness
alone is inadequate to achieve concordance with prescribing guidelines since other factors,
such as perceived pressure to prescribe by clients, hospital culture, and a lack of confidence in
communicating with clients have been described as barriers to judicious use. Information is
lacking on the impact of available educational resources to reduce veterinarian's intentions to
prescribe antibiotics as well as their confidence that they can align their prescribing to AS
principles. An area of identified antimicrobial overuse in companion animal medicine is canine
acute diarrhea, for which up to 70% of veterinarians have been reported to prescribe or intend
to prescribe metronidazole. These factors make it a crucial area for testing the impact of
targeted resources designed to persuade veterinarians to reduce antimicrobial use.
 To foster antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary settings using training or education
tools, we will use the Theory of Planned Behavior to quantify the knowledge, attitude, subjective
norm (perceived social pressure regarding guidelines), and perceived behavioral control
(perceived ability to follow the guideline) related to prescribing metronidazole for dogs with a
common medical condition (i.e., acute diarrhea). We will explore whether a short educational
video on antimicrobial stewardship or a summary of evidence-based guidance with
accompanying citations can impact veterinarians' opinions on prescribing antibiotics for canine
acute diarrhea and define characteristics of antimicrobial use resources that veterinarians
identify as effective in changing their intention to reduce antimicrobial prescribing for canine
acute diarrhea.
 The impact of these resources will be assessed using a cross-sectional survey of
companion animal veterinarians in the United States randomized to 3 arms (no resource,
educational video, summary of evidence-based guidance) followed by focus groups with
participants drawn from each group to define which aspects of AS resources are effective in
reducing veterinarians' intent to prescribe antimicrobial drugs. The outcome of these aims will
facilitate a greater understanding of the potential impact of AS resources on aligning veterinary
AU with AS guidelines and inform further research into the creation and implementation of
resources to companion animal veterinarians to further the goals of antimicrobial stewardship."

11073325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Osteoporosis is a common, chronic disease with an enormous health burden. There is an urgent need for
new anabolic therapies. The long-term goal of this project is to understand genetic risk factors for osteoporosis
to identify new drug targets to reduce this massive health burden. Genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified hundreds of loci associated with bone mineral density (BMD). However, the causal genes at these
loci remain to be discovered. The rationale for this project is that defining causal genes at BMD loci is, at present,
a phenotype-limited problem. More specifically, most causal genes reside in the genomic regions flanking BMD
loci. Thus, each locus implicates multiple candidate genes residing in these flanking regions. However, there are
100s of such candidate genes whose skeletal functions are unknown, and in vivo approaches with sufficient
throughput to fill this phenotype gap are virtually non-existent. There is an urgent scientific need to understand
the functions of genes at BMD loci, because they form the basis for understanding how genetic variants influence
BMD, and in turn, the ability to translate these loci into clinical targets. The objective of this project is to leverage
rapid-throughput biology in zebrafish to advance our understanding of genes at BMD loci that influence bone
mass and quality, and the mechanisms by which they act. Our central hypothesis is that genetic variants
influence BMD by regulating genes at BMD-associated loci, which work in concert to influence bone mass and
quality. In specific aim 1 (SA1), we will identify genes at BMD loci with adult loss-of-function skeletal phenotypes
in a reverse genetic screen. Our team has identified 56 BMD loci in a large-scale GWAS meta-analysis. A novel
phenotyping strategy will be employed to functionally annotate candidate genes residing within 80kb of these 56
BMD loci. Human genetic analyses will be performed to explore how each gene identified in our screen
contributes to BMD. In specific aim 2 (SA2), we will perform a multi-level examination to determine cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which genes at 7q31.31 influence bone mass and quality. SA2 will serve as a model
by which new genes discovered in SA1, and their interactions with each other, will be mechanistically evaluated.
This project is innovative because it substantially differs from the status quo for functional testing for causal
genes at BMD loci—the use of mouse phenotyping consortiums—and harnesses approaches developed by our
team to perform one of the most comprehensive functional analyses of genes at BMD loci to date. This project
is significant because it will: 1) establish an efficient model for exploration of human genomics underlying
osteoporosis-related traits, for which there is an urgent need; 2) identify new skeletal genes at BMD loci, a
genetic territory that is enriched with known osteoporosis drug targets, and which has proven to yield drug targets
likely to be clinically viable; 3) define mechanisms by which genes at 7q31.31 influence bone mass and quality,
as a model of how different genetic variants and their causal genes can act in concert to affect BMD."

Many of the sensations we perceive are caused by our own actions, which we can distinguish from externally
generated stimuli. In the auditory system, the ability to differentiate between external and self-generated sounds
is crucial for functions such as vocal communication, musical training and general auditory perception. The tight
correlation between motor-related signals, or corollary discharge, and the timing of incoming sensory information
is leveraged by the auditory system to discern that a given sound is self-generated. Throughout our lifespan, we
learn that certain movements predictably elicit reproducible sounds. However, in different contextual settings,
the same movements can yield novel sounds that violate expectations from our previous experiences, and we
must update our predictions about the sensory consequences of our actions. Neural responses in sensory
regions of the brain are sensitive to expectations, such that expected self-generated sounds are suppressed in
the primary auditory cortex (A1) and unexpected sounds elicit responses from “prediction error” neurons. The
predictive suppression of expected self-generated sounds in A1 is mediated by secondary motor cortex (M2)
inputs to A1 neurons, which serve as a potential source for establishing specific associations between sounds
and their corresponding movements. However, the function of prediction error signals and the mechanisms
underlying their utilization in generating neuronal representations for newly encountered self-generated sounds
remains unclear. The primary objective of this project is to integrate quantitative behavior, cellular imaging, and
circuit perturbations to examine how coordinated activity between the motor and auditory cortices encodes
movements with various acoustic outcomes and tests the hypothesis that corollary discharge signals do not
simply encode action, but instead convey rich information to sensory cortex about movements and their expected
acoustic consequences. Specifically, we will utilize chronic two-photon (2P) calcium imaging to examine the
response patterns of neuronal ensembles in M2 as mice acquire the association between a lever-pressing
behavior and an accompanying sound. Through changing the sound associated with the lever-press movement,
we will assess the plasticity and reorganization of these circuits as mice learn a new self-generated sound (Aim
1). To further explore the role of the motor cortex in encoding movement with its sensory consequences, we will
employ a chemogenetic approach to selectively inhibit M2 activity at various stages of learning new acoustic
associations and evaluate whether novel sounds can eventually be suppressed in the auditory cortex (Aim 2).
Lastly, we aim to determine whether M2 selectively communicates sound-related corollary discharge signals to
A1 relative to other sensory cortices. (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments will provide valuable insights into the
brain’s mechanisms for predicting and updating the acoustic consequences of our actions in real time and could
uncover fundamental principles underlying the dynamic information flow between sensory and motor regions of
the brain."
11071771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neural self-avoidance is a fundamental yet poorly understood process that is essential for proper brain wiring.
Self-avoidance describes the tendency of neurites originating from the same cell to avoid each other while
innervating target brain regions and finding synaptic targets. This process is mediated by the clustered
Protocadherin (Pcdh) genes, which are differentially expressed between neurons and act as cell-surface
molecular barcodes: neurites presenting the same combination of Pcdh isoforms repel each other, while those
presenting different combinations can interact. Despite their central role in brain wiring, the regulation of Pcdh
genes remains an unsolved problem in neuroscience. Specifically, the mechanism by which neurons choose
specific Pcdh isoforms to express during development, and how this choice is maintained across the lifespan of
a neuron, are unclear. Recent work has demonstrated a role for cohesin-mediated DNA loop extrusion in tuning
Pcdh expression across cell types, suggesting that 3D genome architecture is a critical determinant of Pcdh
gene choice. This proposal aims to test this model in vivo by using optical reconstruction of chromatin
architecture (ORCA), a method for imaging single-allele genome structure in thousands of single cells, to study
Pcdh locus topology in neurons of the olfactory epithelium (OE) and their precursors. By combining ORCA with
RNA labelling of OE cell types and Pcdh isoforms, the first aim will establish a developmental clock of Pcdh gene
choice that links 3D genome folding to the onset of Pcdh expression during development. Genetic mouse lines
will be used to abolish cohesin activity in each cell type to determine how cohesin controls Pcdh choice across
development. The second aim will address how cells achieve transcriptional stability of Pcdh genes across their
lifetimes by considering a role for heterochromatin in the continued silencing of non-chosen Pcdh genes. Through
single-cell sequencing and ORCA experiments, the ability of heterochromatin to stabilize Pcdh gene expression
by sequestering non-chosen promoters away from Pcdh enhancers will be tested. Overall, these studies will
have implications across multiple fields, including brain wiring, translational neuroscience, and gene regulation.
First, they will reveal strategies by which neurons establish proper morphologies, an essential step in circuit
formation across the brain, as seen here through the formation of olfactory maps. Second, Pcdh dysregulation
is associated with multiple neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including schizophrenia and
autism. The principles of Pcdh gene regulation shown here will advance our understanding of these disorder
mechanisms and identify potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. And lastly, the functions of cohesin in
gene regulation have been difficult to determine. The protein complex has primarily been studied in dividing cells
in vitro, where it also plays a vital role in sister chromatid cohesion during cell division. These studies will reveal
new physiological activities of cohesin in single post-mitotic cells in vivo and therefore shed light on long-standing
debates over the ability of cohesin to activate and repress genes."
11070555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing function and maintenance relies on the meticulous assembly of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Prior
research suggests type II SGNs may act as auditory nociceptors and are primed to detect outer hair cell (OHC)
damage. Therefore, type II SGNs may provide a protective mechanism that prevents extreme noise from
damaging OHCs, which are particularly vulnerable. Type II SGNs have a unique projection pattern, with their
peripheral axons extending past the inner hair cells (IHCs), making a 90° turn toward the cochlear base
followed by synapse formation with 10-15 outer hair cells (OHCs). Overall, the mechanisms related to type II
SGN guidance and synapse formation with OHCs are not well understood. Deciphering how multiple axon
guidance cues within the cochlea work together to direct growth cone behavior and synapse formation is
fundamental to determining how the neural circuitry in the inner ear develops and can possibly be re-formed in
the context of hearing loss. Based on published and preliminary data, two signaling systems are predicted to
facilitate type II SGN patterning in the cochlea: planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, and Eph/Ephrin signaling.
 As discussed in this proposal, I will first determine how EPHRIN-A3 and VANGL2 function in type II SGN
guidance by comparing the severity of type II SGN patterning deficiencies in Efna3;Vangl2 double knock out
(DKO) mutants to both Efna3 and Vangl2 single nulls. Second, I will examine possible interactions between
EPHRIN-A3 and PCP signaling during type II turning and OHC innervation by examining EPPHRIN-A3
distribution in PCP mutants at specific developmental stages. Third, I will assess the mode of Eph/Ephrin
signaling in the cochlea by conducting cochlear culture assays at E15.5 and P0. Fourth, I will investigate the
impact on type II SGN-OHC synapse formation upon loss of Eph/Ephrin and PCP signaling, and if randomized
type II SGN turning negatively type II SGN-OHC synapse formation. Overall, I hypothesize that Eph/Ephrin
signaling acts either downstream or parallel to PCP signaling to guide type II SGN turning. My approach to
investigating the molecular basis of type II SGN guidance will include a combination of mouse genetics,
immunohistochemistry, imaging, and morphometric analyses in Imaris. Overall, this research explores a novel
question that will expand our knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling type II SGN
turning and OHC innervation. This research will benefit therapeutic approaches like gene therapy and cochlear
implant technologies aimed at restoring auditory function. The proposed mentoring, research, and career
development training plan will prepare me for flourishing in a career as an independent researcher."

 Diaphragm weakness is a significant health problem in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF). The topic is relevant because respiratory muscle dysfunction impairs coughing and
predisposes patients with HFrEF to pneumonia, activates the sympathetic nervous system causing cardiac
arrhythmias and peripheral vasoconstriction, and impairs alveolar ventilation during exercise and contributes to
shortness of breath and exercise intolerance. A mismatch in production and scavenging of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), accompanied by oxidative modifications of contractile, mitochondrial, and cell signaling
proteins, is a critical determinant of diaphragm abnormalities in HFrEF. Our previous studies suggest that
putative mechanisms for diaphragm fiber atrophy/weakness, contractile dysfunction, and fatigue in HFrEF are
an impairment in protein synthesis/degradation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, several studies
indicate that diaphragm abnormalities contribute to exercise intolerance in HFrEF, although this postulate has
never been tested with diaphragm specific interventions. In this proposal, our goal is to identify the redox-
mediated and protein oxidation mechanisms which are causative in diaphragm fiber atrophy and mitochondrial
dysfunction in HFrEF and define the role of diaphragm abnormalities on exercise tolerance in HFrEF. To
achieve this goal, the diversity candidate will perform perform experiments in in two specific aims. Aim 1 will
test the hypothesis that overexpression of specific oxidized protein reductases prevent ROS-induced
impairments in critical regulators of protein synthesis, mitochondrial respiration and H2O2 emission, and
diaphragm contractile dysfunction ex vivo. These experiments will be performed in myotubes and diaphragm
bundles from healthy sham-operated animals (parent award). Aim 2 will determine whether diaphragm
myocyte-specific overexpression of oxidized protein reductases prevent HFrEF-induced impairments in critical
regulators of protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, and exercise intolerance. Aim 2 will also include a
depper analysis of global and redox proteomics focused on regulation of protein synthesis/degradation. The
experiments in Aim 2 will be performed in sham and HFrEF animals (parent award). To gain further insights
into mechanisms of contractile dysfunction, the candidate will perform measurements of single fiber ATPase
activity during contraction. The project is a logical extension of the parent award that will give deeper insights
into the mechanisms of diaphragm abnormalities in HFrEF. Importantly, the project will provide training in
original research covering a broad spectrum of topics (cell biology, redox biochemistry, muscle physiology, -
omics, and translational research) under the supervision of a mentoring team with member at several career
stages career stages (Assistant, Associate, and Full Professor) provide a comprehensive preparation of the
diversity candidate for a career as independent investigator."

Food insecurity exacts a devastating toll on U.S. families and reflects a long history of structural injustices.
Experiences of food insecurity are associated with higher rates of chronic disease, greater health care costs
and higher acute health care utilization compared to food secure populations. To address food insecurity and
reduce health disparities, there has been a rapid increase in health care-based delivery of food insecurity
interventions. However, evidence demonstrating impacts of food interventions to improve health outcomes
remains mixed. Most existing food interventions act downstream, solely at the individual level, and focus on
delivering food as treatment rather than prevention. There is an urgent need to identify more holistic, patient-
centered food insecurity interventions, and understand their effectiveness in improving health across diverse
populations. This proposal leverages a strong clinical-community partnership that was formed under a
Massachusetts Medicaid (MassHealth) 1115 waiver demonstration to encourage clinical-community
collaboration to identify and address food insecurity as part of value-based care. Under the MassHealth
demonstration, community based organizations (CBOs) design the food insecurity interventions, which are
implemented in partnership with health care organizations. There is growing interest in not only understanding
impacts of state-incentivized food interventions on health, but how to sustain the program and refine program
implementation to achieve the greatest benefit for the largest number of participants. Given the natural
experiment in food intervention delivery unfolding across Massachusetts, we propose a hybrid implementation
and effectiveness evaluation of a multi-component nutrition program developed as a clinical-community
partnership. Aim 1: Quantify the effects of a multi-component food insecurity intervention on clinical outcomes
among Medicaid enrollees with diabetes, hypertension and depression receiving care at a large federally
qualified health center. Using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference design we will compare health
outcomes between participants and two separate propensity weighted comparators. Aim 2: Evaluate the
impacts of a multi-component food insecurity intervention on (a) cost and (b) health care utilization among
adult and children Medicaid enrollees receiving care at a federally qualified health center. Using administrative
claims data, we will compare changes in total cost of care and acute health care utilization (ED visits, inpatient
hospitalization days) between participants and propensity weighted comparators. Aim 3: Using the I-PARIHS
implementation framework, identify determinants of implementing a food insecurity intervention for scaling and
sustainment."
11063301,"Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery.
While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on
predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be
even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer
chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some
cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac
contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart
and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+
can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate
arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins.
Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to
cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage,
calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable
to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cellby-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes,
but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high
throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile
motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will
be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated
microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test
compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will
develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs
representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response,
30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and
specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based
preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models
and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research."

This grant focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of cerebral blood flow decreases in mouse
models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We recently showed there is increased incidence of the transient arrest of
circulating neutrophils in capillaries in the brain of AD mouse models. Because blood cells flow single file in
capillaries, this leads to stalled flow in the capillary segment. We serendipitously discovered that administration
of antibodies against the murine neutrophil surface protein, Ly6G, rapidly interferes with this neutrophil arrest,
decreasing the incidence of stalled capillaries by about two-thirds. We further found that this decrease in capillary
stalling was associated with a ~30% increase in cerebral blood flow, and was accompanied by a rapid
improvement (within hours) in performance on spatial and working memory tasks. In this grant, we are aiming
to:
 • Aim 1 – understand the cellular mechanisms contributing to neutrophil arrest in capillary segments, where
 we test three hypotheses: capillary constrictions caused by pericytes; binding to increased adhesion
 molecules on the endothelial surface; binding to exposed basement membrane and adhesion molecules
 in the widened gap between endothelial cells.
 • Aim 2 – evaluate the role of reactive oxygen species produced by NAPDH oxidase as an initiating factor
 in the arrest of neutrophils in capillaries.
 • Aim 3 – assess whether improving cerebral blood flow over time decrease amyloid-beta aggregation and
 neuropathology, taking advantage of knock-in mouse models of AD.
 • Aim 4 – use three photon excited fluorescence microscopy to assess capillary stalling and blood flow in
 the hippocampus
We have made major progress on Aims 1 and 2, with a recent publication and a second manuscript currently in
revision. We are conducting experiments for Aim 3 now, and we had our first hippocampal imaging working in
the last couple of months to start Aim 4. Unfortunately, we had a ~15 year old femtosecond laser system recently
fail. This laser is essential for the two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy that is the dominant experimental
approach we use in this work. We are requesting supplemental funding to help replace this laser."

 The purpose of the proposed research is to facilitate learning experiences in a two-year post-doctoral.
training experience, connecting the intersection between learning novel imaging algorithms to risk stratify
individuals with high-risk Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) as well as their clinical validation and association with
clinically relevant outcome measures. In addition, this grant is also looking to provide opportunities for
underrepresented background post-doctoral, Dr. Tapia. She will be a part of the development of this project and
will be supported with the tools and opportunities to learn this scientific/research pathway with the principal goal
of empowering her for an independent project in the future. Integration of professionals with diverse backgrounds
is the way to create and develop research projects with the vision to provide better outcomes for the community.
 Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) poses a significant growing public health concern, with millions
worldwide affected by progressive functional decline. Association with other comorbidities such as Diabetes
Mellitus (DM) creates a challenging approach diagnostically and treatment-wise. Our proposed research seeks
to get a better understanding of how the pathophysiology and adaptations at the microvascular levels for PAD
and DM are seen. With imaging dual isotope (82Rb/18F-LMI1195) hybrid Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/
Computerized Tomography (CT) these imaging techniques are great options for these patients, helping the future
approach and treatment.
 Amis 1A, 1B, and 2 will be focused on understanding the technical aspects of PAD, as well as how the
different imaging procedures will give us a better understanding of this condition. Aim 3 will be directed to validate
the data using the PORTRAIT and SCOPE-CLI study designs. Data recollection will allow us to evaluate imaging
protocols in a real-world population and correlate risk profile information with imaging characteristics validating
the imaging protocols, while also generating further hypotheses. The proposed project represents the
implementation of a new imaging protocol and generating benefits in the approach and treatment of this chronic
condition, PAD.
 The training position will span over a period of 2 years, during which it will be involving a combination of
the pre-clinical aspect in animal models, and then screening in human subjects. Accurate quality control
measures in the image acquisition and data recollection period as well as the multidisciplinary collaboration will
be needed to achieve high-quality outcomes and robust validation and translational potential.
 In conclusion, this proposal ambitions to enhance Dr. Tapia's learning experience by integrating new
knowledge and research skills. It will also involve the development and implementation of imaging protocols for
future approaches and treatment of PAD and DM."
11061606,"Virus particle assembly of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, takes place at the plasma membrane (PM)
in most cell types including natural host T cells. This process is driven by a viral structural protein Gag. The
N-terminal matrix (MA) domain of Gag determines Gag localization to and hence virus assembly at the PM.
MA mediates membrane binding of Gag via N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a highly basic region (HBR)
that binds acidic lipids. Binding of HBR to a PM-specific acidic phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 is critical for PM
localization of Gag and efficient virus release. Notably, we and others showed that MA HBR also interacts
with tRNAs, which suppress binding of Gag to non-PI(4,5)P2 acidic lipids, suggesting tRNAs as a host
factor that regulates MA-membrane interactions. However, structural determinants for the tRNA-MA HBR
interaction and its reversal by the interaction with PI(4,5)P2, combination of which regulates PM-specific
Gag localization, remain to be examined. Binding of tRNAs to MA HBR is most likely to occur at translation
sites due to limited availability of tRNAs outside of the translation machinery. However, little is known about
subcellular sites of Gag translation, where Gag begins its movement to the PM. At the PM, Gag
multimerization and subsequent accumulation of acidic lipids are likely to promote recruitment of host
transmembrane proteins, but their effects on virus spread to uninfected cells remains to be determined in
the context of cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission.
Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms that determine sites of HIV-1 assembly and to use the
knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central hypothesis in this application is that MA HBR
interactions with tRNAs, which begin during translation, and with acidic lipids determine subcellular Gag
localization and the properties of progeny virions. To test this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) identify structural
determinants for interactions of MA HBR with tRNAs and acidic lipids; 2) identify tRNAs that suppress
PI(4,5)P2-independent membrane binding but allow PI(4,5)P2-mediated reversal; 3) understand the effects
of Gag translation sites on the fate of Gag; and 4) examine the effects of host transmembrane proteins
incorporated into virus particles on formation of virological synapse and virus-cell contact. The knowledge
gained from experiments outlined in this proposal will likely help us develop antiviral strategies that target
mechanisms regulating Gag localization to the PM, thereby inhibiting extracellular virus release and
spread."

Episodic memory involves learning and recalling associations between items and their spatio-temporal context.
Those memories can be further used to flexibly support different behavioral demands. In this proposal we
address the question of how the fine temporal coordination of neuronal activity across entorhinal and
hippocampal areas support learning and memory. Oscillatory synchrony in the theta (~5-9 Hz) and gamma (~30-
100 Hz) frequency bands between hippocampus and entorhinal cortices has been implicated in these processes,
although the precise mechanisms are not known. The medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) entorhinal areas are the
major source of inputs to the hippocampus. Previously, we found that gamma oscillations synchronize population
activity in hippocampal-entorhinal circuits during navigation and learning. However, how the gamma-frequency
coordination of hippocampal assemblies brought about by distinct entorhinal inputs supports the formation and
reactivation of specialized memory representations in different CA1 subpopulations is not known. In this
proposal, we will deploy a novel approach combining multi-region laminar recording and temporally selective
optogenetic perturbations to elucidate the circuit mechanisms that support spatial and non-spatial learning in
rats. Previous work suggested that different CA1 pyramidal cell subpopulations are specialized in encoding
complementary memory representations, and they receive differential innervation from MEC and LEC. In Aim 1,
we will perform simultaneous neural recordings across CA1-2, MEC and LEC while rats navigate mazes to
examine how area and layer-specific gamma synchrony modulates neuronal firing dynamics. This will be enabled
by a novel analytical method to isolate different pathway-specific gamma oscillations durign behavior. In Aim 2
we will investigate how functional interactions among neuronal assemblies across these structures are
modulated by behavioral demands, by training rats in different types of learning tasks. We will investigate whether
different hippocampal-entorhinal neuronal subpopulations form assemblies and sequences representing
behavioral relevant locations during learning. We will also test the causal contribution of entorhinal gamma inputs
to this process with selective optogenetic perturbations. The sequential activation of cell assemblies during
behavior is recapitulated during pauses in exploration and sleep, coordinated by SWRs; a process that supports
memory consolidation. In Aim 3 we will test if synchronous M/LEC inputs influence which assemblies are
recruited into SWRs, therefore determining which aspects of experience are replayed and consolidated. To do
so, we will perform closed-loop optogenetic silencing of CA1 condition on real-time detection of M/LEC inputs
during sleep periods following different learning tasks. By combining technical innovations for recording,
analyzing, and manipulating circuit dynamics, this proposal will reveal how entorhinal inputs support hippocampal
representations, memory replay and predictive coding. These Aims will also expand our understating of
fundamental circuit mechanisms of impaired cognition common to multiple neuropsychiatric diseases."

There is currently no validated treatment to prevent the development of acquired epilepsies, such as post-
traumatic epilepsy. The availability of biomarker that predicts, at an early stage, people at risk to develop epilepsy
and benefit from treatment interventions would significantly accelerate and de-risk the process of identifying an
antiepileptogenic therapy. In this study, that is based on collaborations and preliminary data derived from
EpiBioS4Rx, an NINDS funded Center without Walls, we aim to create a rigorous and effective preclinical model
to screen a new candidate treatment to prevent posttraumatic epilepsy in the lateral fluid percussion injury model
as well as identify biomarkers to guide treatment implementation. We will follow a multicenter, double-blinded,
vehicle-controlled, randomized preclinical antiepileptogenesis study following the high standards of rigor
advocated by NINDS, the AES/ILAE Translational Research Task Force and the ARRIVE guidelines. We have
formed a collaborative group of four international preclinical testing centers (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
University of Melbourne, two UCLA sites), supported by experts in pharmacokinetic modeling (University of
Minnesota), protein biomarker research (Uniformed Services University of the Health Services) and
bioinformatics (University of Southern California). We plan to test a compound that removes pathological iron
stores from the brain and test whether it can modify early biomarkers of epileptogenesis and injury. We aim to
identify (a) at least one panel of multimodal biomarkers that can predict early on treatment response to the iron
chelator, including the development of post-traumatic epileptogenesis, (b) at least one biomarker of
epileptogenesis, (c) and determine whether iron chelator treatment can prevent post-traumatic epilepsy
development."

Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into Lewy Bodies and Lewy Neurites is a hallmark of the Lewy Body
Dementias (LBD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Parkinson’s Disease-Dementia. Additionally, some brain
regions in Alzheimer’s Disease have pathological α-syn. Therefore, α-syn is likely a major cause of cognitive
decline across several dementias. One possible mechanism underlying the core cognitive impairments centered
around impaired executive function in LBD may be loss or dysfunction of projection neurons from the basal
forebrain that produce acetylcholine (ACh). Across LBD, there is profound loss of cholinergic cells of the basal
forebrain, which project to the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL-mPFC), a known key brain nucleus for
executive function. Basal forebrain ACh acts through nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) to
modulate PL-mPFC glutamatergic projection neurons critical for normal executive function. Recent evidence has
further refined the mechanisms by which ACh regulates the PL-mPFC, and has suggested a key role for the M1
mAChR in regulating executive function. Despite this critical neuromodulatory role of ACh and M1 in the PL-mPFC
in executive function, there are few studies that examine this important relationship in the context of α-syn related
dementias. This has led to our overall hypothesis that cognitive decline in the context of α-syn linked
dementias results from disrupted ACh signaling in the mPFC. We have used the pre-formed fibril (PFF)
model of α-synucleinopathies to show that inputs into the PL-mPFC show enhanced ACh dependent long term
depression in PFF injected mice. Additionally, layer 5 pyramidal cells of the PL-mPFC show decreased excitability
in PFF injected mice compared to controls that may be attributable to ACh dependent changes in intrinsic
properties of these cells. This suggests that α-syn dysregulates multiples aspects of the PL-mPFC through
alterations in ACh release or signaling. To rigorously test this, we will perform a series of electrophysiology and
behavioral experiments to determine, define, and dissect how α-ayn dysregulates the PL-mPFC through loss of
ACh signaling or release. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn dysregulates PL-mPFC inputs through
altering ACh signaling. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that α-syn alters intrinsic properties and output of PL-
mPFC projection neurons through loss of ACh signaling. In aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that boosting
cholinergic signaling will rescue deficits in executive function. Completion of these aims will provide fundamental
understanding of how α-syn dysregulates ACh signaling to impair executive function in LBD."

Alzheimer’s disease is ravaging the world’s elderly population and creating a heath and societal burden that
appears likely to increase. Basic research can inform on mechanisms relevant to late onset neurodegenerative
disease and suggest avenues of treatment. Healthy aging of the brain requires meticulous maintenance of
protein synthesis/folding/degradation systems, and this capacity is often disrupted in neurodegenerative
disease. Recently it has come to be appreciated that disease neurons can produce toxic products like
aggregated proteins that can be taken up by neighboring cells—there is speculation that this mechanism might
be involved in disease spread within the brain. How neurons generate and send out large-sized extracellular
material in vivo is an open question that must be addressed as we consider therapeutic intervention.
We study the aging nervous system in the simple animal model C. elegans, in which individual neurons, as
well as labeled aggregates within them, can easily be visualized in the living animal. We have unexpectedly
discovered that some C. elegans neurons can exude large packets we call “exophers”. The contents of these
dramatically expelled exophers can contain introduced human disease protein aggregates. Multiple
approaches to exaggerating protein folding stresses in those neurons, including over-expressing human
Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment A 1-42, and genetically or pharmacologically impairing branches of
protein homeostasis, increase exopher formation. Aggregated proteins extruded in exophers can be taken up
by distant cells.
We hypothesize that we have identified a previously unrecognized alternative route for adult neurons to clear
protein aggregates. We speculate that this mechanism, and the associated mechanism of release and uptake
by surrounding cells, is conserved across species and related to currently unknown mechanisms operating in
human brain relevant to neurodegenerative disease.
We propose to exploit the considerable advantages of the C. elegans model system (transparent body, easy
genetic manipulation, exquisitely defined nervous system, powerful cell biology, short lifespan) to advance
understanding of exopher biology. Our goals are to: 1) probe the biology of old age exophers (induction,
functionality, and longevity gene interface); 2) screen human neurodegenerative disease-related genes for
roles in C. elegans exopher formation; 3) begin to decipher the mechanism whereby AIP-1, needed for
exopher production and known to protect against broad proteotoxicity, influences exopher-genesis under
proteo-stress.
Our work should inform on a novel pathway of cell maintenance relevant to both healthy brain aging and a
neurodegenerative disease, defining a new area for study and for development of clinical interventions."

The human tendency to discriminate emerges early in development: By 3 months of age, infants
prefer looking at same-race faces over different-race faces. However, it is unclear how these
perceptual tendencies translate to later racial prejudice and stereotypes. Previous infancy
research on racial groups has mostly focused on perceptual skills (such as classifying faces of
different races) rather than infants’ cognitive reasoning about and naturalistic behaviors toward
different racial groups that may be more direct precursors of racial biases. Of the few studies that
explore whether infants use race to guide their behaviors, there are conflicting evidences: Some
find that infants show more positive behaviors toward same-race than different-race people,
whereas others find no evidence of race influencing infants’ behaviors. Such discrepancy could
be due to these studies not accounting for infants’ experience with different race individuals.
Exposure to different races clearly impacts infants’ face processing; it is possible early social
experience with racially diverse individuals may also shape infants’ cognitive inferences about
and social behaviors toward people who differ from them in race. The current project will thus fill
a critical gap in our knowledge about how exposure to different races shape infants’ inferences
about and stranger fear toward different-race individuals in the K99 phase (Aims 1 to 2). Aim 1
will examine whether infants have differential expectations about intra- vs. inter-racial interactions
and whether racial diversity in their social networks and neighborhood environments relate to their
expectations about interracial interactions. Aim 2 will utilize large-scale, longitudinal datasets to
analyze whether infants show greater fear to racial outgroup than ingroup strangers, whether
stranger fear is modulated by neighborhood racial demographics, and how this fear may change
across development from infancy to childhood. In the independent R00 phase (Aims 3 to 4), the
candidate will integrate techniques learned from her F32 and K99 phases to examine which type
of exposure to different-race individuals most effectively changes race-based reasoning and
behavior in infancy and childhood. Specifically, the R00 research will examine if interactive
interactions with different-race individuals are more effective than passive exposure in changing
inferences, stranger fear, and neural activities toward racial outgroup individuals in infants (Aim
3) and children (Aim 4). These studies will help elucidate the developmental trajectory of racial
biases. This award will provide the candidate, who has a strong background in experimental
research with children, with training in infancy and longitudinal research techniques to facilitate
her transition to an independent researcher that can lead large-scale, longitudinal research efforts."
11057751,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Substantial resources have been devoted to policy evaluation of clinical genomic sequencing that hinge on the
conceptualization and measurement of utility. However, most evaluations fail to capture the full utility of
genomic sequencing because they do not account for impact on family members. Pediatrics is a clinical area in
which study of family impact is imperative due to the clinical nature of genetic disorders that manifest in
childhood and the patient-parent-physician decision-making context, in addition to potential identification of
patients’ biologic relatives who may benefit from genetic screening. Although traditional decision science
methods for health economic evaluation produce evidence in the form decision-makers rely upon, they tend to
focus on the individual patient and do not consider the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of testing
for families. Cross-disciplinary effort is necessary integrate ELSI issues that influence clinical implementation
and family preferences using decision science methods for robust modeling and outcomes assessment. This
Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will equip the candidate, a health economist, with expertise in
ELSI in order to conduct innovative research using decision science methodology that integrates ELSI
considerations. The candidate’s career goal is to be a tenure track professor with an independent research
program to meaningfully evaluate the impact of genomic medicine and expand the evidence base for policy
decisions about its implementation. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a clinically relevant and
ELSI-informed model to assess family-level impact of genomic sequencing in the context of pediatric clinical
care. Based in the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Baylor College of Medicine, the candidate will
pursue training in three domains during the mentored phase of the project (K99): (1) ELSI, including qualitative
research methods and normative ethics; (2) pediatric genetics clinical context; (3) advanced decision science
methods, including patient preference elicitation and decision analytic modeling. The training will be applied to
conduct research to better understand the utility of pediatric clinical genomics at the family level by considering
ELSI and family preferences. The specific aims of the research project are: (1) identify relevant attributes and
normative values for family-level evaluation of pediatric genomic sequencing; (2) examine how parents value
those attributes of genomic sequencing using a discrete choice experiment; (3) develop a decision analytic
model of family-level impact of pediatric genomic sequencing to examine its use as a diagnostic tool and
explore the importance of including ELSI and family preferences in utility measures. This project will have high
impact by advancing utility assessment of genomic medicine to better guide clinical and policy decision-
making. Results will inform clinical guidelines, reimbursement strategies, and ethical implementation of
pediatric genomic sequencing to improve patient and population health."
10989373,"The Old-World Arenavirus Lassa (LASV) can cause severe hemorrhagic Lassa fever (LF), which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in West Africa every year. As the most exported hemorrhagic fever, LASV also poses a significant global health risk. LF is recognized as a “Priority disease” by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The trimeric glycoprotein complex (GPC) is the only viral protein expressed on the virion surface and responsible for LASV cell entry. Each monomer within the trimer is composed of the non-covalently associated stable signal peptide, the receptor-binding subunit, GP1, and the fusion machinery, GP2. LASV sequentially utilizes two host receptors for cell entry, the matriglycosylated alpha-dystroglycan (matri-α-DG) at the cell surface and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in the endosome during endocytosis of the virion. The receptor switch requires an acidic pH-induced conformational rearrangement of the GPC trimer, called GPC priming. Structural biology has only captured atomic snapshots: prefusion GPC in complex with matriglycan, and then individual subunits: post-fusion GP2, and a low-pH incubated GP1 truncation presumed to be in the primed state. The inherent metastability of GPC has thwarted efforts to obtain high-resolution structures of trimeric GPC in priming states and the GPC:LAMP1 complex. In this project, we will fill in these important missing structures and illuminate pH-driven changes in the GPC trimer and mechanisms for receptor switching. The proposed structural work for this program is made feasible by a novel LASV GPC construct engineered by the PI that maintains native conformation at neutral pH and is capable of priming and LAMP1 binding at acidic pH, without dissociation of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. Importantly, insights from these studies can be applied to other medically relevant, pH-dependent receptor-switching arenaviruses, such as the ubiquitous Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and the rare, but potentially more fatal, Lujo virus."
11060656,"Preeclampsia (PE) affects 5-7% of all pregnancies in the U.S and 30% of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy 
are caused by chronic hypertension (HTN) prior to pregnancy which increases the risk of superimposed PE 
(SIPE). Despite being a leading cause of maternal death and perinatal morbidity, the mechanisms responsible 
for PE and SIPE are unclear. Healthy normal pregnancy (NP) is associated with elevations in progesterone 
and T helper 2 (TH2)/uterine natural killer cells (NK cells), favoring immunotolerance of the fetus. Activated 
lymphocytes during NP express progesterone receptors, which stimulate a protein called Progesterone Induced 
Blocking Factor (PIBF). PIBF increases during NP and stimulates interleukin-4 and TH2 cells (IL- 4/TH2) cells, 
both of which are reduced during PE. PIBF also decreases the deleterious effects of cytolytic NK cells in 
murine pregnancy. Importantly, we showed that PE is a progesterone deficient state that is associated with an 
imbalance between TH1/TH2 cells, NK cells, and inflammatory cytokines that lead to endothelial dysfunction, 
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and HTN. We also reported that the increase in TH1 cells contributes to 
production of agonistic angiotensin 1 receptor autoantibody (AT1-AA) by B cells, increases in endothelin (ET1) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), all of which are associated with PE and SIPE. Even though 
PIBF is essential for maintenance of NP, a role for PIBF to stimulate IL-4/TH2 as a mechanism to improve the 
pathophysiology associated with PE or SIPE has not been studied. My recent published data indicate that PIBF 
attenuates HTN and improves fetal IUGR in response to placental ischemia in the reduced uterine perfusion 
pressure rat model of PE. In addition, my exciting clinical data show that PE patients have reduced PIBF, and 
supplementation with progesterone (as 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC)) improves TH1/TH2 ratio. 
Although PIBF stimulates TH2 lymphocytes secreting IL-4, whether 17-OHPC stimulates PIBF to protect 
against PE or SIPE is unknown. Thus my hypothesis is that an increase in uterine artery resistance index leads 
to a decrease in PIBF and IL-4 leading to increased TH1, NK and AT1-AA, causing changes in vasoactive 
factors (increased sFlt-1, ET-1; decreased nitric oxide), thus contributing to SIPE with exacerbation of HTN in 
the mother and IUGR in the offspring. This hypothesis will be tested using the pregnant Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) 
rat, a model of superimposed PE, and will utilize a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine 
the following specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that 17-OHPC supplementation in the pregnant DS 
rat, a model of SIPE, reduces BP and stimulates PIBF, reduces inflammation, AT1-AA, sFlt-1, ET-1, improves 
endothelial-dependent relaxation, and prevents development of IUGR in offspring. Aim 2: To test the 
hypothesis that PIBF supplementation in pregnant DS rat, a model of SIPE, reduces BP, stimulates IL-4/TH2, 
reduces cytolytic NK cells, inflammation, AT1-AA, and reduces sFlt-1, ET-1, improves endothelial dependent 
relaxation, and prevents the development of IUGR in offspring"
11061618,"Project Summary
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in the United States and although patients initially
respond to cytotoxic chemotherapy, most relapse with chemoresistant disease within 24 months. There are
several critical gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms that support disease recurrence but research over the
last decade support the notion tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a subpopulation of drug resistant tumor cells, are
responsible for facilitating relapse and combination therapies targeting these elusive cells may lead to longer
remission or even cures. Although numerous genes and signaling pathways have been implicated in maintaining
TICs, there are several critical gaps in our understanding of the processes these cells use to survive cytotoxic
chemotherapy and successfully re-establish tumors. Our previous studies revealed an important role for
alternative NF-kB signaling in regulating stemness genes and supporting chemotherapy resistance. NF-kB is a
family of transcription factors that respond to signals in the TME to promote proliferation, chemoresistance, and
survival of cancer cells through activation of either RelA or RelB transcription factors. Clinical data from patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy show that genes encoding alternative NF-kB family members are
significantly elevated in tumors resected following cytotoxic chemotherapy relative to pre-treatment levels.
Recent findings in our lab also implicate RelB in isolation and nutrient stress. These data lead us to our central
hypothesis that alternative NF-kB activation is critical for maintaining tumor-initiating cells that facilitate ovarian
cancer relapse. To investigate this hypothesis, the student will 1) Perform limiting dilution spheroid formation and
xenotransplantation studies using RelB or control knockout ovarian cancer cells and 2) investigate the
requirement for RelB signaling in metastasis ability in the presence and absence of chemotherapy. These
experiments will provide critical evidence not currently addressed in the parent grant or in prior published work
to distinguish the role of RelB in chemotherapy resistance versus tumor-initiating cell phenotypes. Given the
strong initial response to chemotherapy, it is of great interest to identify mechanisms that maintain TICs in ovarian
cancer. NF-kB regulates several gene programs that support stemness and survival pathways. Clarifying
whether this pathway imparts only chemotherapy resistance or whether it also supports long-term survival of
TICs and regeneration of heterogeneous tumors will improve our understanding of NF-kB in relapse and will
inform future therapeutic directions."

Rigorous data from our lab and others indicate that the gut microbiome may an underappreciated contributor to
inter-individual variations in cancer drug efficacy and side effect profiles; however, we currently lack the
mechanistic insights and data from preclinical mouse models necessary to inform ongoing studies in cancer
patients. We selected fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine (CAP), as
an initial test case due to their critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, increasing oral administration,
highly variable pharmacokinetics, and unexplained differences in efficacy and toxicity. We propose a series of
in vitro and mouse studies to dissect the human gut bacterial species, genes, and enzymes responsible for the
metabolism of 5-FU (Aim 1) and CAP (Aim 2), including their downstream consequences for drug
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).
Our overarching hypothesis is that the oral bioavailability and therapeutic effects of fluoropyrimidines
are influenced by pathways for drug metabolism encoded by diverse human gut bacterial species.
In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the primary gut bacterial taxon responsible for 5-FU inactivation
through a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays coupled to studies in gnotobiotic and xenograft
mouse models. Based on our Preliminary Results, we hypothesize that Anaerostipes is the primary gut
bacterial genus responsible for inter-individual variations in the metabolism of 5-FU.
In Aim 2, we seek to discover the bacterial enzymes responsible for the activation of CAP to 5-FU, motivated
by the surprising finding that E. coli can activate CAP leading to reduced bacterial growth at high
concentrations. We hypothesize that E. coli catalyzes a 3-step metabolic pathway that mirrors the mammalian
conversion of CAP to 5-FU.
Our results in Aim 1 will provide a valuable proof-of-principle for dissecting the conservation and redundancies
in clinically relevant microbial biotransformations, helping to move beyond studies of model gut bacteria to
identify the most translationally relevant species. Aim 2 is potentially paradigm-shifting in that it would provide
definitive evidence for CAP bioactivation outside of hepatocytes and cancer cells, creating new opportunities to
improve treatment outcomes and study the physiological role and broader impacts of this metabolic pathway.
Taken together, this research plan emphasizes the conservation of the pathways for metabolism of
therapeutics across domains of life, highlighting the need to distinguish the relative contributions of human and
microbial cells to drug disposition, efficacy, and side effect profiles. Due to our focus on drugs used as current
standard of care and naturally occurring bacterial species prevalent in the human gut microbiome, this
preclinical research program has clear translational relevance and is highly synergistic with ongoing clinical
studies of cancer patients conducted by our team and the broader microbiome field."

The supplement grant is to request the support for Mr. Emanuel Baltrip, a graduate student of
African American, to pursue his Ph.D. training. In research aspect, he will work on his dissertation
project, a part of the parent funded parent project (1R01CA257842-01A1) on developing
polymeric micelle delivery of paclitaxel and cyclopamine for the treatment of hepatocellular
adenocarcinoma (HCC) in orthotopic mouse models. In mentoring and career development
aspect, Mr. Baltrip will be trained in developing research skills in hypothesis development,
experimental study planning and execution, critical data analysis, and verbal and written
communication skills, as well as developing proposals, to acquire a comprehensive set of skills
for becoming a conscientious and capable cancer researcher of the underrepresented ethnicity,
to fulfill the unmet clinical need for improving the survival and quality of life of HCC patients.
The 3 specific aims for Mr. Baltrip’s project are:
(a) De-risking of M-CPA/PTX in single- and multiple-dose toxicity to evaluate the differential
 toxicity in male and female mice, recently observed in Dr. Chow’s lab with male mice being
 more sensitive for adverse events than the female counter part. The differential drug
 metabolism between sexes is the hypothesis to be tested.
(b) 1. Comprehensive characterization of pharmacokinetic (PK), exposure in tumor and
 organ biodistribution of CPA and PTX from the dose of M-CPA/PTX
 2. Establishment of the dose proportionality of the unique delivery system, M-CPA/PTX after
 single and multiple doses that will contribute to the rational dose finding based on the
 established dose linearity range, and
(c) Derivation of PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) correlation of M-CPA/PTX for the treatment of HCC
 in orthotopic mouse models, using alpha-fetoprotein as a PD biomarker for the development
 and treatment response of HCC to monitor the treatment efficacy of M-CPA/PTX. Other tumor
 measures including tumor growth suppression and animal survival will also be monitored for
 other PK/PD correlations. These studies will offer projection of effective exposures in plasma
 and tumor for the intended efficacy."
11062550,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
To optimize drug dosing, clinicians may order laboratory testing of drug levels in patient blood samples, but
the clinical benefit of such testing is limited because testing is slow and infrequent. While field-use
measurement systems are a partial solution, a major problem is that a person's drug pharmacokinetics
(PK) can vary over time and from person to person. Through innovative use of new tools from Al and data
science, we propose to develop a personalized therapeutic drug monitoring (pTDM) system incorporating
(1) frequent noninvasive field measurements of drug levels and (2) a platform that delivers in real-time a
profile of the circulating drug levels and patient-reported clinical information. We will assess the system's
accuracy in the context of measuring salivary levels of anti-seizure medications for people with epilepsy. In
our four research aims, we will develop a personalized drug titration PK model; electrochemistry assays for
two anti-seizure drugs in saliva; electronic and electrochemical components and computational tools
needed for a field-use platform; and an integrated and validated field-use measurement platform. In our
two broader impacts aims, we will train students in transdisciplinary science and engage with caregivers
and patients to obtain feedback and ensure equitable benefits from pTDM.
Successful completion of our project's research aims will address critical knowledge gaps in how to (i)
account for varying pharmacokinetics in saliva-based personalized therapeutic drug monitoring; (ii)
address the challenges of electrochemical drug measurement in saliva given sample-to-sample variation in
background matrix; and (iii) address the challenges of integrated field-use pTDM system development with
low-power microelectronics. Further, the integrated system that we develop will demonstrate the benefits
of using machine-learning to overcome the challenges of variable PK and saliva background matrix in the
context of personalized therapeutic drug monitoring for chronic conditions and would be transformative for
the field. As such, our project is in excellent alignment with the NIBIB's mission to transform, through
garnering knowledge and technology development, disease treatment."
11062567,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that negatively affects young people across the globe. Pulmonary
 exacerbations (PEx), episodes of decreased lung function accompanied by coughing, increased sputum
 production, and weight loss, are a hallmark of CF lung disease. Besides negative health impacts, PEx
 comes with a burden to healthcare costs in the United States and beyond ($10K-$40K USD per episode).
 Although PEx can be treated with antibiotics, patients still experience decreased quality of life and
 ultimately reduced survival. A point-of-care, rapid, and accurate test to identify impending PEx that would
 benefit from treatment could have an impact on families of children with CF and their clinicians through
 reducing misdiagnosis and overtreatment. Breath testing, through identifying volatile organic compound
 (VOC) biomarkers, holds great promise for the development of home-based/clinical testing solutions for
 PEx. The goal of this research is to develop a hand-held smart sensor system that can detect exhaled
VOC biomarkers for PEx noninvasively in real-time. To accomplish this, machine learning will be utilized
 to identify a breath-based biosignature of PEx (Aim 1). In parallel, the team will design/test a nanosensor
array to detect the biosignature (Aim 2) and develop a user-friendly smartphone app to be used at-home
 or in the clinic (Aim 3). Ultimately, this research will further the development of diagnostic solutions for
 PEx, and advance knowledge in a multi-faceted fashion across disciplines including basic science,
 chemistry, engineering, medicine, biotechnology, and health informatics. The technological solution is
highly disruptive and challenges the current paradigm of how PEx is diagnosed. From an engineering
 perspective, sensors are at the cusp of being translated into biomedical devices, and this research aims to
overcome challenges in selectivity that can also be leveraged for VOC-based diagnosis of other heart and
lung diseases beyond CF. The interdisciplinary team has vast experience in their respective fields, and
their collaboration ensures successful completion of the research. A diverse set of resources/equipment
from the team's laboratories, along with others on campuses, will be leveraged to support research
activities.

Molecular imaging (MI) originated in the need to better understand the fundamental molecular pathways inside
organisms in a noninvasive manner. Over the past two decades, two factors have acted in concert to fuel the
ascent of molecular imaging in both the laboratory and the clinic: (1) an increased understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of disease and (2) the continued development of in vivo imaging technologies, ranging
from improved detectors to novel labeling methodologies. We have established a vibrant and state-of-the-art
laboratory-based translational research program. The Lewis lab portfolio is situated at the intersection of various
disciplines – radiochemistry, cancer biology, chemistry, pharmacology and engineering. Our program has
already demonstrated that our work is not just to generate an “image” but also to non-invasively and
quantitatively measure target biology within a cancer. Even with the extensive preclinical advances in cancer
imaging that we have accomplished and the unparalleled visualization of cancer biology we have achieved, our
ability to translate our findings cannot be understated. Our program has excelled in the clinical translation of new
imaging agents, providing new insights into cancer biology in humans. In the realms of this R35 we plan to focus
on three main areas of discovery: (1) Can our successful imaging agents be transformed into theranostic agents
with the ability to quantify the target through non-invasive imaging while providing concomitant lethality? (2) How
can our theranostic agents be optimally deployed to quantitatively and non-invasively interrogate and treat tumor
heterogeneity? (3) Following conventional and/or novel targeted therapies, can we image cancer-specific
pathways to provide immediate and real-time predictors of response? We will exploit recent findings and novel
methods to answer these questions, using an integrated set of imaging, chemical, genomic and cancer biology
approaches. As such, the questions posed above will be of more general relevance and will allow us to address
concepts related to the interactions between imaging, therapy, and response."

Immunotherapy is the standard of care and an effective treatment for colorectal cancers with deficient
mismatch repair proteins (dMMR). The deficiency contributes to high tumor mutational burden in the tumors
and the generation of neoantigens that can activate the immune system. However, despite the effectiveness of
immunotherapy for dMMR colorectal cancers, up to half of patients with dMMR cancers do not derive clinical
benefit from the treatment. Intrinsic or acquired resistance to immunotherapy may limit clinical efficacy and
thus a better understanding of the factors and mechanisms that lead to resistance is needed. The growing
interest in using immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting for dMMR tumors further underscores the need to
prevent or limit resistance to immunotherapy. Tumor intrinsic factors and mechanisms related to molecular
alterations and changes in signaling pathways likely contribute to pre-existing and acquired immunotherapy
resistance. Targeting tumor-intrinsic mechanisms in combination with immunotherapy may improve overall
survival of patients with dMMR colorectal cancers. Our main goal for this study is to identify and validate genes
and signaling pathways associated with resistance to immunotherapy in dMMR colorectal cancer using a
mouse model and gene-editing tools. We will validate a select set of genes most likely to play a role in
resistance to immunotherapy. In the long term, data from this project will guide our efforts to determine the
mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and to design highly effective combination therapies that either
anticipate or limit the development of resistance to immunotherapy."

NCI Diversity Supplement | Project Summary | March 31, 2024
Many RAS-transformed cancer cells are able to escape cytotoxic chemotherapy and survive in near-starvation
conditions. One adaptation making them hard to kill is their ability to scavenge extracellular proteins and
recycle the cellular components using autophagy, both of which are then digested in lysosomes to recover free
amino acids. Nutrient transporters, such as SLC38A9, have been shown to act as gates that release digested
nutrients back into the cell, which in turn restarts cellular growth programs. Intriguingly, RAS-transformed
pancreatic cancer cells with SLC38A9 knocked-out are unable to efficiently form tumors, which presents a
novel therapeutic idea of targeting a metabolic vulnerability. In this R00 supplement project, we will expand on
that initial discovery from pancreas cancer. First, we will explore whether other cancer types that carry
mutations in RAS and Wnt signaling pathways can also perform nutrient scavenging via macropinocytosis.
Second, we will test whether an inducible genetic knockout of SLC38A9 hampers growth of
macropinocytosis-positive cancer cells that otherwise grow successfully on an extracellular protein diet.
Knockout of SLC38A9 will lead to entrapment of macropinocytosis-derived amino-acids within the lysosomes,
and our expectation is that this treatment will impair the growth of tumors addicted to protein scavenging, while
sparing normal cells that lack this requirement. This supplement will allow us to broadly generalize the
anti-cancer strategy that we are establishing in the R00 parent grant. Importantly, the supplement will help us
recruit and train a promising post-baccalaureate student who has a great potential for a future career in
scientific research."
11062157,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Over 90% of adult males develop lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to bladder outlet obstruction
by age 80 secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH, the most common proliferative abnormality
in humans, negatively impact the quality of life of 210 million men globally, accounting for significant life years
lost. In this study we propose to clinically evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to 5α-reductase inhibitor,
finasteride, one of the more common drugs used to manage BPH and associated LUTS. Ongoing work in our
lab has focused on steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2, aka: 5α-reductase 2 [5AR2]), the enzyme responsible for
prostatic development and growth. Our investigations have revealed that expression of SRD5A2 is variable,
and in fact, 30% of men do not express SRD5A2 in prostate tissues. In previous work, we showed that somatic
suppression of SRD5A2 during adulthood is dependent on epigenetic changes associated with methylation of
the promoter region of the SRD5A2 gene. Our studies indicate that (1) methylation of the SRDA2 is regulated
by direct binding of the DNA-methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) protein to the SRD5A2 promoter; (2) the
inflammatory mediators TNF-α, NF-kB, and IL-6 regulate DNMT1 binding and subsequent methylation of the
SRD5A2 promoter region; (3) clinical conditions associated with increased inflammation, age, and obesity, are
associated with decreased expression of SRD5A via epigenetic modification; (4) in the absence of prostatic
SRD5A2, alternate estrogenic pathways are upregulated, leading to an androgenic-to-estrogenic switch in the
prostate gland, thus creating alternate pathways for prostatic growth. Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) non-
invasive assessment of SRD5A2 methylation status in peripheral blood can be an excellent indicator
for resistance to 5ARI therapy, and (2) in men demonstrating hypermethylation of SRD5A2 and low
protein expression (patients suspected of being resistant to 5ARI therapy), combination therapy
(Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators [SERMs]+5ARI) will serve as a better treatment strategy. To
demonstrate the clinical significance of epigenetic changes to SRD5A2 and confirm its role in regulating
sensitivity to 5ARI treatment, and to examine the role of estrogenic signaling blockade, we propose a clinical
trial with: Specific Aim 1: To assess the role of combination therapy (5ARI + SERM) in the treatment of BPH
and to determine whether methylation of SRD5A2 promoter is a predictor for response to therapy. Specific
Aim 2: To prospectively evaluate whether non-invasive radiologic prostate inflammatory markers can predict
circulating WBCs SRD5A2 promoter methylation."

Although exposure and response prevention (ERP) is well-established as the first line of treatment for obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), 40-50% of patients who receive this intervention do not recover. Novel
augmentations are needed to more efficiently target the mechanisms that maintain OCD symptoms in this
population. One candidate mechanism is interpretation bias, the misinterpretation of ambiguous stimuli as
threatening, contributing to the development and maintenance of OCD. In the absence of interventions that more
efficiently and effectively target interpretation bias, it will likely remain difficult to increase rates of treatment
response and decrease relapse. The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility, acceptability, adherence,
target engagement, and clinical outcomes of an intervention targeting interpretation bias, with the ultimate goal
of contributing to the development of novel, scalable, technology-driven augmentations to ERP. Improvements
in interpretation bias have been associated with OC symptom reduction. Therefore, an accessible intervention
which directly targets interpretation bias may be an ideal augmentation to improve clinical outcomes during ERP.
Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation Bias (CBM-I), a computerized intervention, has shown reliable
effects for engagement of interpretation. Studies of CBM-I in OCD have been largely conducted in analogue
samples, and studies with clinical samples have been limited. This proposal will address the critical need of
developing interventions to augment ERP by utilizing CBM-I, with primary aims to: 1) test whether CBM-I induces
changes in interpretation bias in OCD and to determine if these changes are associated with clinical outcomes
across multi-modal assessments, and 2) leverage advances in machine learning to develop personalized
predictions of which individuals with OCD are best-suited for CBM-I. We hypothesize that a multivariate model
incorporating pre-treatment clinical, behavioral and demographic characteristics will predict patient-specific
probability of responding to CBM-I. These aims map onto the candidate’s training goals, with critical new training
and mentorship provided in the areas of: 1) effectiveness trials methodology with an experimental therapeutics
approach (Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Courtney Beard; Co-Mentor Dr. Sabine Wilhelm); 2) ecological momentary
assessment (Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Christian Webb and Dr. Beard; Collaborator Dr. Justin Baker); 3) machine
learning techniques (Dr. Webb and Collaborator Dr. Boyu Ren); and 4) career development (Co-Mentor Dr. Kerry
Ressler). This K23 Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research and provide the
candidate with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on advancing the
understanding, prediction, and treatment of non-response and relapse, to optimize outcomes of exposure
therapy for refractory patients with OC-related disorders."
11063620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women in
the US, with screening recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to reduce
incidence and mortality. Despite national targets, CRC screening rates, especially among patients receiving
services in low-resourced settings, remain below these goals. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)
serving predominantly underserved populations face challenges in achieving equitable screening rates. Health-
related social needs (HRSNs), such as housing instability and transportation issues, play a significant role in
CRC screening completion disparities. However, their impact on patients' CRC screening completion remains
underexplored.
This diversity supplement (DS) proposal will investigate the associations between HRSNs and follow-up
colonoscopy receipt among FQHC patients with abnormal stool-based test results. This population will be
reached by leveraging outreach to safety-net settings such as The Ohio State University Wexner Medical
Center, KPNC/KPSC and the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network
partnership—all strategies for aim 3 of the parent grant. This DS complements the proposed work in the parent
grant, primarily through its support of its first specific aim. For parent grant Aim 1, the DS will contribute a
qualitative approach to understanding the CRC screening continuum through the lens of a particularly
disadvantaged population (FQHC patients), paying special attention to patients' HRSNs. The DS will further
contribute to the understanding of recommendation-concordant CRC treatment timeline adherence for
members of this population who receive abnormal stool test results. The results of the DS will provide
covariates of interest (e.g., specific HRSNs, Social determinants of health) for the statistical analyses proposed
in Aims 2 and 4 of the parent grant. Data will be collected that may ultimately influence the development of
interventions targeting HRSNs to enhance CRC screening completion rates in vulnerable populations. Drawing
from existing literature on other cancer types, we hypothesize that patient-level HRSNs strongly influence
screening completion and subsequent outcomes.
Dr. Aldenise Ewing, the DS candidate, aspires to become an independent investigator focusing on addressing
cancer-related health disparities. This supplemental application will provide a mentored experience in cancer
health disparities and cancer control for Dr. Aldenise Ewing. The study findings will provide preliminary data on
social determinants of CRC-related outcomes and strengthen her K01 submission within 2 years of funding
and R01 or equivalent grant submission within 5 years of funding. Moreover, it will contribute crucial insights
into addressing social determinants of health in low-resource settings, ultimately improving health outcomes for
all populations."
11063623,"SUMMARY
The metabolic syndrome affects a quarter of the global adult population and a third of US adults. Efforts are
needed to identify and intervene on preventable risk factors for the metabolic syndrome. Firm evidence supports
that metals and metalloids (metals for simplicity) play a role in atherosclerosis and increased risk of CV disease.
Evidence also suggests that exposure to metals may contribute to the development and accelerated progression
of metabolic syndrome. Studying whether metabolic outcomes are potential mediators of metal-related CV
disease during young adulthood is critical as it is a time when prevention interventions can be implemented
before overt cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes have fully developed.
In this supplement, we will leverage data from the VapeScan Study (parent R01) in young adults 18 to 50 years
of age from New York City to examine associations of metal exposure with metabolic profiles and the role of
metabolic outcomes in metal-related atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that metal exposures (e.g., cadmium,
manganese), including metal mixtures, are associated with higher levels of metabolic markers measured at
fasting (aim 1). Subsequently we will evaluate if these metabolic outcomes are associated with coronary artery
calcification in young adults (aim 2). In aim 3, we will evaluate if metabolic outcomes influence the association
of metals with coronary artery calcification, through mediation or moderation. We will utilize metals measured in
urine and blood and metabolic outcomes measured under fasting conditions (glucose, lipids, blood pressure) in
adults 18 to 50 years of age who have been recruited as part of the VapeScan Study. We will evaluate metals
individually and as a mixture. Priority metals include cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), Selenium (Se)
and zinc (Zn) in blood, and the same metals as well as 10 other metals in urine. Metabolic factors are obtained
at the baseline visit and two follow-visits over a 1.5 year period. Coronary artery calcification is obtained by
cardiac CT at the baseline visit. As the participants are healthy young adults, the metabolic outcomes (glucose,
lipids, blood pressure) will be primarily included as continuous. Metals and coronary artery calcification will be
log-transformed as they are right-skewed. Models will be adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, vaping status and
other relevant variables. This project will provide novel evidence on the role of metals and metal mixtures on
metabolic outcomes and the role of metabolic outcomes to influence metal-related atherosclerosis. These data can
support early interventions that target modifiable disease factors to prevent metal-related CV risk. By providing
advanced skills, training, and research opportunities to an MPH student with focus in Environmental and
Molecular Epidemiology, this project will enhance diversity in our research team at Columbia University and
down the road in the field of environmental health sciences."
11063625,"Project Summary
Despite advancements in healthcare and cancer treatments, a notable disparity in cancer outcomes persists
among different racial and ethnic groups. While factors like healthcare insurance expansion, early detection,
new treatments, and smoking cessation have contributed to increased survival rates, African Americans and
ethnic minorities continue to face disparate outcomes. The American Cancer Society highlights that African
Americans experience later diagnoses, lower screening rates, greater illness burden, the highest death rates,
and the shortest survival times compared to other racial groups.
Clinical trials have the potential to enhance outcomes, nonetheless, disparities persist in the enrollment of
Black and Hispanic individuals in cancer clinical trials. Over the past two decades, there has been a significant
decline in the participation of minority patients in clinical trials, and this gap has widened further in the
aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Efforts to address these disparities have included interventions like provider bias training and various methods
to boost enrollment of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials. However, the effectiveness of these
interventions remains limited without widespread implementation. While patient-clinician communication is
identified as a crucial factor in improving clinical trial accrual, existing studies lack comprehensive geographical
and demographic testing.
This study aims to fill these gaps by employing a tool based on community input and co-developing suitable
criteria for scoring the quality and content around clinical trial discussions. Recognizing the impact of effective
communication on overall health, healthcare literacy, treatment adherence, trust-building, and reducing
disparities, the study seeks to provide clinicians with tools to facilitate discussions with minorities about cancer
clinical trials, addressing a critical need in the current landscape of cancer care. The importance of this study
lies in its exploration of this phenomenon in a manner that has not been extensively investigated, offering a
unique perspective on the challenges faced by minority populations in accessing and participating in clinical
trials.
This supplement will provide essential experience, partnerships, and preliminary data for my career
development. It will be a catalyst for applying for an NIH R-level grant to investigate a communication
intervention for improving clinical trial accrual among minoritized cancer patients. The mentorship plan, led by
an experienced team dedicated to supporting underrepresented researchers, will help me achieve my goal of
becoming an established researcher through regular meetings, training, and guidance."

Neuromuscular disorders are often heritable and typically result in progressive loss of strength and inability to
stand, walk, and breathe. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a inherited neuromuscular disorder caused
by the loss of dystrophin protein, which renders the muscle membrane highly susceptible to injury. Currently,
there are limited therapies available to correct the neuromuscular defects in DMD or delay disease
progression, although a number of treatments have been recently approved or are in clinical trials. Despite this
success, these treatments are only available to small percentage of patients and have limited efficacy. Latent
TGF-β Binding Protein 4 (LTBP4) was discovered as a genetic modifier of muscular dystrophy using an
unbiased genomewide screen. It was subsequently shown to have a similar genetic modifying signal in human
DMD patients. LTBP4 protein localizes to the myofiber exterior where it binds and sequesters all three forms
of TGF-β, regulating latent TGF-β release and activation and its subsequent cascade of pathological
downstream signaling. Excess TGF-β activation is a pathological finding in many forms of neuromuscular
disease, especially DMD, the limb girdle muscular dystrophies and the congenital muscular dystrophies. In the
muscular dystrophies, excess or hyper-activated TGF-β is linked to fibrotic infiltration of muscle and impaired
muscle regeneration. The genetic data was used to identify the hinge region of LTBP4 as critical to latent
TGF-β release and activation. LTBP4's hinge region can be proteolytically cleaved and this cleavage
promotes release of latent TGF-β, which is then fully activated by additional steps. The genetically protective
form of LTBP4 in mice is less susceptible to protease cleavage, correlating with a decrease of the normally
hyperactive TGF-β state in muscular dystrophy, and this correlates with delayed dystrophy progression. In
humans, the protective effect of LTBP4 correlated with longer ambulation in three independent DMD cohorts.
We devised an antibody strategy to stabilizes the LTBP4 hinge and limit latent TGF-β release. Proof of
concept data in the mdx mouse model of DMD demonstrates that an anti-LTBP4 antibody directed at the hinge
region can be used to mitigate disease progression. Anti-LTBP4 hinge region antibodies protected against
LTBP4 cleavage, reduced fibrosis formation, and enhanced recovery after muscle injury. This proposal outlines
the developmental plan of a lead LTBP4 biologic for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders split into two
phases. The first aim of phase 1 is designed to optimize the lead LTBP4 biologic and evaluate short-term in
vivo efficacy of the optimized leads. The second aim of phase 1 is to validate pharmacodynamic biomarker
assays. Aim 1 of the second phase will focus on pre-clinical studies and initiation of manufacturing, while aim
2 will progress the clinical candidate into BioPharm Early Development and IND filing."

The goal of the Guided Research Experiences & Applied Training (GREAT) in Alcohol Studies program is to
provide innovative, intensive summer research experiences, in the study of alcohol and related behavioral
health outcomes, for undergraduates from underrepresented (UR) groups, in order to create a pipeline for
increasing diversity in biomedical and behavioral research. Since 2019, the program has funded research
experiences for 46 undergraduates from underrepresented groups with a majority of fellows continuing to
another research experience. The program also boasts high STEM graduation rates and ~40% enrollment in
graduate school. In the next funding period, GREAT in Alcohol Studies will bring together undergraduates from
Virginia Commonwealth University and Rutgers University to: (1) offer an innovative, 8 week summer research
experience for 10 program fellows, consisting of a combination of structured training (Week 1) and individual
mentorship (Weeks 2-8) under faculty with expertise in substance use and behavioral health, designed to
provide young researchers with foundational research skills, experiential learning, and responsible conduct of
research training; (2) provide professional and career development opportunities for fellows, to facilitate
student success in research and to prepare students for behavioral research careers; (3) offer fellows a
comprehensive mentoring model including a mentor at each project site and “near peer” mentor from our
alumni pool; and (4) disseminate program findings and student research through both traditional (e.g., scientific
posters) and innovative (e.g., infographics) means, to train the next generation of researchers in the
dissemination and translation of research. Professional and career development, as well as research
internships, will extend beyond the summer program, affording support throughout the remainder of the fellow's
academic career. Program success will be evaluated across recruitment, student program completion, and
fellows' continued engagement in research and entrance into research-related careers. GREAT offers fellows
exciting benefits including an expansion of alcohol-related research training within two diverse universities,
cross-fostering of ideas and exchange of information between students at both sites, and expansion of student
networks through additional mentorship opportunities and position us to contribute significantly to increasing
diversity in the next generation of alcohol researchers."

Renal cell carcinoma is the most common primary kidney cancer, representing 90-95% of primary renal
neoplasms. Our work in the parent award has identified a novel liver-brain-adipose tissue-kidney
gluconeogenesis axis that drives renal cell carcinoma, driven by fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21. While
completing studies in the parent award, we became aware that our murine models of RCC exhibit cancer
cachexia, with striking loss of skeletal muscle. Cancer cachexia is a widespread and debilitating problem, and
the work proposed in this supplement will test the hypothesis that FGF-21-driven renal gluconeogenesis
may be a key contributor to cachexia in renal cell carcinoma. The candidate, Andin Fosam, is an African
American, first generation American citizen who aims to become a physician-scientist leading a translational
research program at the intersection between oncology and preservation of functional status. The work
proposed in this supplement application will position Andin, an M.D./Ph.D. student completing her doctoral
work in the PI's lab, as a growing leader in this multifaceted area, which is in deep need of new investigators to
push the boundaries of our understanding of how physiologic principles can help avoid the devastating
consequences of cancer cachexia."

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, continues to be a major public health
issue. A proportion of SCA events occur in persons engaging in drug use and given that drug overdose
deaths are at unprecedented levels in the United States, the epidemiology of drug related SCA is changing
rapidly. Recognition and characterization of drug related SCA events is critical for accurate estimates of
mortality associated with drug use, and to inform public health measures, especially in the context of the
ongoing opioid epidemic. This proposed study will address several of the major knowledge gaps. This K01
Career Development Award leverages the existing infrastructure and clinical data archive of two ongoing
prospective community-based studies of SCA. Dr. Norby will use this data to examine the epidemiology of
SCA associated with drug use, with the overall goal of improving community-based approaches to SCA
prevention. This proposal aims to 1) identify opportunities that will improve survival from SCA in the
setting of drug use, and 2) identify substrate-trigger factors that initiate SCA in the presence of drug use.
Taken together, these aims will interface community-based surveillance and comprehensive investigative
reports to fill in the epidemiology and research gaps in SCA events related to substance use. To address
these research aims, Dr. Norby will assemble records and reports in these two communities for SCA cases
that have previously been excluded due to evidence of drug use. The overall goal of this K01 is to inform
a sequence of R series grants to further investigate the prediction and prevention of SCA, and to improve
survival after an SCA event related to drug use. With the support of this K01 award, Dr. Norby will be able
to pursue this goal and transition to independent investigator status through essential training and
mentorship. She will gain advanced training in 1) combining multimodal health records across systems
and extracting pertinent information; 2) pharmacoepi drug use research and analysis of drug-drug
combination; and 3) SCA mechanisms, SCA response and care, and additionally gain familiarity with
toxicology and autopsy reports. Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute provides the ideal infrastructure to
complete the research and training activities. Through the proposed research, training, and career
development Dr. Norby will gain the scientific and professional skills necessary to become a successful
independent investigator and lead a research program that advances the field of SCA associated with drug
use."

Over a thousand human genes have dedicated roles in the ubiquitin pathway, making it one of the most
complex signaling systems. About 650 of these genes encode ubiquitin ligases (E3s), which recognize
substrates and target them for degradation. Our laboratory has developed several methods, based on both cell
biological and affinity approaches, to identify substrates of ubiquitin ligases, and have used these to identify
over two dozen substrates of five ligases. However, like phosphorylation, in many cases loss of ubiquitination
has no obvious phenotype. We have used the R35 mechanism to completely re-configure ourselves into a
mammalian cell laboratory and undertaken a large screen to identify phenotypes for poorly understood human
E3s/DUBs. We created a CRISPR library against human E3s/DUBs and performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9
screen combined with chemical inhibition of 41 compounds targeting genome integrity, cell cycle progression,
transcription, RNA processing, translation, mitochondrial function, protein folding, metabolic pathways,
transport, cytoskeleton, etc. By probing a diverse set of biological processes for E3/DUB involvement, we
were able to assess the specificity of these interactions. Overall, we identified one or more specific interactions
for 161 E3/DUBs (about 25% of those examined), many of which were previously unstudied. Some genes,
such as FBXW7, showed interactions with more than one-third of the compounds. Others showed interactions
only with a single compound or a set of related compounds. We are focusing our efforts on following up four
sets of ligases: mutants in the poorly studied RING ligase RNF25 were extremely sensitive to alkylating
agents, but not other forms of DNA damage; mutants in the unstudied CUL5 adaptor WSB2 were exquisitely
sensitive to inhibitors of nuclear export; the CUL4 adaptor DCAF7 has a role in maintaining viability during a
CDK4/6 arrest; and the poorly-characterized F-box protein FBXO42 has clear roles in mitosis. We will use both
genetic screens and our established mass spec approaches to identify the relevant substrates of these ligases.
In addition, we will continue with our analysis of ubiquitin linkages. We have carried out a large genetic
interaction screen in yeast to identify roles of individual ubiquitin linkages. We will expand upon this screen and
will carry out complementary mass spectrometry approaches to identify relevant substrates."
11057176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly all of the ~9 billion possible single nucleotide variants compatible with life exist among the 7.8 billion
individuals alive today. Understanding the effects of these variants, especially in disease-associated protein
coding genes, is central to understanding human biology and to using genome sequence information to guide
the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Unfortunately, most new variants revealed by genetic testing are
variants of uncertain significance, meaning insufficient information exists to definitively interpret the variant as
either pathogenic or benign. Variants of uncertain significance cannot be used to guide patient care and reflect
our incomplete understanding of variant effects. To overcome this challenge, we developed saturation genome
editing (SGE) and variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq), multiplexed assays of
variant effect that can make and measure the functional effect of massive numbers of variants. In SGE, single
nucleotide variants are edited directly into the genome, revealing the effect of these variants on cell survival
due to effects on splicing or protein function, thereby enabling accurate identification of both pathogenic and
benign variants. VAMP-seq measures the effects of missense variants on protein abundance inside cells, and
can identify up to 80% of pathogenic variants. Together, SGE and VAMP-seq can be applied to at least 40% of
genes to produce high quality, clinically useful functional data at single nucleotide resolution. Already, variant
functional data produced by each of these methods are being used by clinicians to interpret genetic variants.
Our proposed Center for Actionable Variant Analysis (CAVA) will harness SGE and VAMP-seq to
contribute single nucleotide variant functional data for ~200,000 variants in ~32 of the most clinically
impactful protein coding genes to the IGVF Variant/Element/Phenotype Catalog. To accomplish this
transformative goal we propose four Aims. In Aim 1, we will choose target genes and assays using a
framework that maximizes clinical need, clinical impact and practicality. Each target/assay pair will be
rigorously validated prior to entering production. We will contribute to the Consortium during the first year and
beyond by developing standards, sharing reagents and initiating collaborative projects. In Aim 2, SGE and
VAMP-seq will be performed on ~32 genes to high quality standards tracked using well-defined metrics. These
include assay dynamic range and reproducibility, individual measurement error, and concordance with existing
functional data and gold standard clinical data. A data analysis pipeline, integrated with our LIMS, will ensure
reproducibility and enable careful progress tracking. In Aim 3, we will share the multiplexed variant functional
data. Rigorously defined data sharing standards and metadata will ensure discoverability, computability and
durability. We will work with the Consortium to achieve consensus and we will revise our plans accordingly. In
Aim 4, we will enable labs to quickly stand up SGE or VAMP-seq. We will create a predict-evaluate-revise cycle
that leverages the data we will generate and work collaboratively to generate data to improve modeling efforts."

Influenza virus is a serious public health threat causing high levels of morbidity and mortality. The annual disease
burden from influenza places a significant strain on our healthcare infrastructure and economy. This is despite
many efforts to control disease with yearly vaccination, antiviral drug therapies, and other medical and public
health interventions. To address the continuing health and economic costs, there is a clear need to better
understand the molecular mechanisms of influenza virus replication and how these can be manipulated for
therapeutic benefit. Influenza virus exploits, and in some cases subverts, cellular factors and pathways to
promote replication. We identified RNA:protein interactions between viral and host partners that impact innate
immune responses during infection. We showed IFIT2 is a critical cellular protein that binds viral mRNAs to
enhance replication. This was surprising, as IFIT2 is one of the first proteins expressed in response to viral
infection and displays broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of IFIT2,
and how this is co-opted into a proviral effector by influenza virus, are not yet known. We also showed that
influenza nucleoprotein (NP) is a key viral protein that binds host RNAs. This assigns a new activity to NP that
our data suggest is part of a previously unappreciated strategy to dampen innate immune responses. The overall
goal of this application is to determine how these RNA:protein complexes composed of both viral and host
components manipulate innate immune responses to support viral replication. In Aim 1, we investigate how IFIT2
functions as a front-line defender in a broadly acting antiviral response. We hypothesize that IFIT2 enhances
translation of antiviral proteins, an event that is repurposed by influenza virus to promote production of viral
proteins. We test this using experiments that investigate the processes by which IFIT2 engages target RNAs,
affects translation of its bound mRNAs, and alters infection. Aim 2 interrogates the impact of interactions between
viral NP and host RNAs. This aim proposes that NP:RNA complexes moderate innate immune responses. We
investigate this by studying RNAs and infection-induced events that activate innate immune pathways, and
discern the impact on viral replication. The results from this proposal will establish a mechanistic understanding
of the viral and host factors regulating innate immune responses and how influenza virus tips the balance to
favor replication. Moreover, while our studies focus on influenza virus, the underlying mechanisms we discover
will have broad impacts on the general understanding of host antiviral responses and unexpected strategies
used by viruses to counteract them. Completion of this proposal will provide fundamental knowledge that can
contribute to new therapeutic approaches or cellular targets that can be exploited for the rational development
of anti-influenza virus therapies."

 Emotion-regulatory deficits are a hallmark of mood and anxiety disorders, which afflict over 20% of
adults in the United States. Poor emotion regulation is often characterized by the context-inappropriate
expression of emotion, including the unwarranted persistence and influence of negative states outside their
temporal context. Therefore, the ability to respond to emotional events in a temporally and contextually
sensitive manner is paramount to mental health and wellbeing. Evidence from cognitive control studies
indicates that function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), including lateral frontal pole and mid-LPFC, is
essential for temporally organized cognitive control and behavior sensitive to goals and context. However,
mechanistic studies of LPFC function in emotion are lacking, even though there are strong indications of a
prominent but little-understood role for LPFC in promoting adaptive emotional functioning, including
hypoactivation and reduced LPFC connectivity in mood and anxiety disorders, associations between LPFC
lesions and incidence of major depression, and the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to LPFC to
treat depression. The central goal of this proposal is therefore to elucidate the organization, representational
and causal contributions of distinct LPFC regions for adaptive time and context sensitive emotional responding.
 This proposal tests the central hypothesis that the human lateral frontal pole (FPl) integrates emotional
and temporal information to promote goal-oriented and context-sensitive responses via downstream mid-LPFC
function. This hypothesis is informed by documented neuroanatomical projections, insights into the
organization of temporal control in LPFC, and recent work unveiling functional specificity in distinct LPFC
regions during emotion-dependent cognitive control.
 Using an innovative combination of multivariate analysis of fMRI data and information-guided TMS, the
proposed studies examine the representational and causal roles of distinct LPFC regions for (1) goal-oriented
action that requires accurate tracking of temporally extended emotional information (Aim 1) and (2) temporal-
context sensitive regulation of affect (Aim 2). Full-factorial representational similarity analysis will permit
quantifying emotional valence, temporal, and contextual goal signals—as well as, critically, their interaction.
Information-guided TMS, followed by task fMRI acquisition, will establish functional and representational
specificity of distinct LPFC regions—FPl and mid-LPFC—with causal inference (Aims 1b-2b). Task-based
functional connectivity analysis will uncover the topology of amygdala-LPFC interactions (including
intermediary mPFC nodes) associated with emotion-temporal integration and affect regulation (Aim 3).
Collectively, these Aims will advance a directional model of how LPFC function and amygdala-LPFC
interactions support adaptive time-and-context appropriate responses in the face of emotional challenges."

Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and is the most
common genetic cause of intellectual disability. DS predisposes affected individuals to a wide range of
comorbidities that shorten their life expectancy and lower quality of life. People with DS are strongly predisposed
to develop autoimmune disorders, show consistent activation of interferon (IFN) responses, and produce
significantly less saliva than healthy controls. These last set of features are shared with another syndrome,
Sjogren’s Disease (SjD), an autoimmune disease affecting salivary (and lacrimal) glands resulting in reduced
saliva, elevated autoantibodies (SSA, SSB) in serum, and lymphocytic infiltration of the glands. In DS, there is a
triplication of the interferon receptor (IFNR) gene cluster resulting in chronic interferon hyperactivity and
inflammation. In SjD, patients exbibit not only salivary gland inflammation and elevated levels of type 1 IFN.
Because of the shorter life expectancy associated with DS and given that SjD predominantly affects middle-aged
persons, this may have biased findings linking both conditions, although some case reports have described SjD
in DS. Our preliminary data, obtained in our studies part of the parent grant, show that Dp16 mice hyposalivate,
indicating abnormal salivary gland function. The aim of this supplement is to address if DS is a condition that
predisposes individuals to develop Sjogren’s-like disease. To address this, we will challenge the Dp16 mice, a
well-known DS mouse model, with agonists of both toll-like receptors (TLR), particularly TLR7 and TLR8, which
we and others have been reported in salivary glands and in SjD, and interferon stimulation (e.g. DMXAA), and
to test the ability of common blockers of IFN signaling, such as JAK inhibitors, to ameliorate inflammation and
improve salivation. These studies enhance the goals of the parent award by assessing whether the salivary
glands in Dp16 mice are prone to developing an inflammatory response typical of SjD."

Domestic violence (DV) includes physical and sexual violence, threats, economic, and emotional/psychological
abuse, or other abusive behavior as part of a systematic pattern of control and power perpetrated by one intimate
partner against another. It causes a significant burden for the healthcare systems by increasing morbidity and
mortality among victims. Women are disproportionately affected, although men may experience DV as well. The
recent COVID-19 pandemic led to movement restrictions and stay at home orders. While these decisions were
essential to prevent spread of the virus, such extended domestic stays may exacerbate the number the total as
well as reported incidents of DV. As a result, in recent years, DV has transformed into a shadow pandemic,
which further complicated this public health issue and increased the need to perform accurate and timely
interventions.
DV often forms a pattern, and many of the victims experience repeated acts of physical or mental abuse. Victims
of DV may seek care in hospital settings which makes timely interventions critical and even lifesaving. While
there is a serious need for government to reinforce commitments made to eliminate all forms of DV against
women, the health sector plays an essential role in breaking the cycle of abuse. Health providers can prevent
reoccurrence of such violent incidents by identifying women who are experiencing DV, and then provide
comprehensive services and train health providers in responding to the needs of survivors in addition to caring
for physical injuries. Abused women rarely disclose the reason for emergency department (ED) visit due to
various reasons including shame, fear of the perpetrator or financial dependencies. While these factors form
patient-specific barriers to screen for DV, the barriers to screening, detecting and helping DV victims can be
recognized at different levels during an ED visit. Since these barriers are not clear, more exploration is needed
to understand important features by analyzing EHR data to gain further understanding of the clinical experience
and environment.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will use the DV-related ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis codes to find positive cases of DV
among the visits to ED. Then adapt market-basket analysis, which is a data mining method originated in the field
of marketing, to our objective and identify patterns of injury and health problems which are observed together
frequently. Then, we will utilize state-of-the-art deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models
to learn the patterns in electronic health records clinical notes related to DV. In Aim 2, we will conduct semi-
structured interviews with ED health providers to investigate the barriers to screening for DV during patient-
provider encounter. The outcomes of this study have the potential to add significant insights to improve the
screening process and the care we provide our patients in the ED.

Infertility and subfertility are critical health problems affecting about 9 % of couples worldwide. Since the first
successful “Test-Tube” baby in 1978, over 5 million babies were born using Assisted Reproductive Technology
(ART). ART includes such techniques as in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI),
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and embryo transfer techniques. ART is used in humans, and in
animals of economic relevance. In humans alone, IVF and ICSI are used ~ 800,000 times per year. In all
species, the limiting factor for successful pregnancies to occur is obtaining good quality preimplantation
embryos which have a direct influence in implantation and pregnancy rates. Capacitation involves crosstalk
between metabolic and signaling pathways. In the previous period, we showed that a short incubation with the
Ca2+ ionophore A23187[7] can induce in vitro fertilizing capacity in sperm from sterile knock-out (KO) genetic
models. We hypothesized that, at least, in part, A23187's effects were due to changes in metabolism. When
sperm metabolism was changed using starvation and rescue protocols, we observed that intracellular Ca2+ was
elevated. In addition, we found that, similar to A23187, sperm incubated in the absence of nutrients become
immotile. Once nutrients are added back to the incubation media, sperm motility is rescued and those sperm
depict higher percentage of hyperactivation and enhanced in vitro fertilization (IVF) rates. Unexpectedly, eggs
fertilized with sperm incubated in metabolic enhanced conditions were more efficient in producing blastocysts
and those blastocysts generated more implantation sites and produced more pups when transferred to
pseudo-pregnant females. This proposal has basic and applied goals. The basic science objective is to
understand the molecular basis of these methods with particular emphasis on the crosstalk between calcium
and metabolic pathways. At the translational level, our goal is to use novel sperm incubation conditions to
improve ART."

The ability to tightly control metabolic homeostasis is critical for animal survival. The internal sensory nervous
system monitors the status of organs, providing feedback signals that enable the brain to maintain homeostasis
by executing behavioral and physiological responses. For example, the system detects and encodes
gastrointestinal cues signaling the quality and quantity of food ingested during a meal to control feeding behavior,
digestive physiology, and whole-body metabolism. Dysregulation of internal sensory systems that monitor the
digestive system can lead to various diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and anorexia. The internal sensory
gateway in the brainstem, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), receives inputs from the gastrointestinal,
respiratory, and cardiovascular systems through the vagus nerve and other neural/humoral pathways. In turn,
the NTS projects to diverse higher-order brain regions to generate our perceptions of satiety, hunger, nausea,
and visceral pain. Despite the importance of internal sensory systems in health and disease, how neural circuits
process visceral signals to regulate behavior and physiology is vastly understudied. Disentangling the highly
interconnected brainstem neurons requires a comprehensive analysis of the anatomy, sensory coding, and
function of the NTS network to understand the circuit components that mediate individual visceral senses. In Dr.
Stephen Liberles’ lab, my initial postdoctoral work deciphered the sensory representations of bodily cues in the
NTS. In this proposal, the goal is to determine how internal sensory information, after being processed in the
NTS, is sorted into downstream brain regions to control specific aspects of behavior and physiology. First, the
neuroanatomical logic by which NTS projections are organized will be investigated (Aim 1). Second, visceral
cues transmitted by each projection will be determined using in vivo calcium imaging of NTS projection neurons
(Aim 2). Last, the functional roles of NTS projections in controlling behavior and autonomic physiology will be
established, with the focus on pathways that mediate physiological satiation (Aim 3). Research in this proposal
will be conducted under the guidance of Dr. Stephen Liberles, who pioneered the study of viscerosensory
neurons in the vagus nerve using genetic approaches, Dr. Clifford Saper, a leading scientist in the neuroanatomy
of the viscerosensory system, and Drs. Bradford Lowell and Eleftheria Maratos-Flier, experts in neural control of
appetite and energy metabolism. This proposal will establish a functional atlas of NTS projection neurons in
visceral senses, providing insights into our understanding of the neuro-circuitry underlying metabolic
homeostasis and strategies to develop targeted treatments for metabolic and viscerosensory disorders."

Exposure to alcohol during pregnancy produces fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) that are associated 
with sensory and cognitive deficits. Individuals with FASD have impaired auditory processing and also frequently 
exhibit atypical auditory behaviors. Developmental alcohol exposure has been shown to cause impairments in 
neuronal plasticity including reduction in dendritic spines and alterations in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function. 
However, currently there is a gap in understanding how the effects of alcohol on AMPARs alters synaptic 
plasticity in the intact brain and how changes in AMPAR trafficking can result in alterations in auditory processing. 
Here, we will use a prenatal exposure mouse model of FASD to investigate the mechanism of auditory 
processing deficits observed in FASD. We will examine auditory processing in mice prenatally exposed to 
alcohol, perform in vivo imaging in the primary auditory cortex to track AMPARs and dendritic spines over days, 
and perform electrophysiological recordings to study AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. The goal of the 
proposal is to provide a mechanistic basis for the altered auditory processing observed in FASD and examine 
the therapeutic potential of the BDNF mimetic 7,8-Dihydroxy flavone to preserve or restore central auditory 
processing following fetal alcohol exposure."

This supplement proposal is closely related the parent grant for two major reasons: 1). Breast
cancer patients with disabilities fared worse than those without disabilities. The same occurred in
non-small cell cancer or cervical cancer patients with disabilities. However, it is unclear how to
best use ML tools to address this health disparity issue. As a direct extension of the parent grant’s
overarching goal that focuses on all cancer patients, the proposed work will exclusively focus on
the cancer patients with disabilities and plan to improve ML performance and survival rates in
these patients. 2). Based on reported incident cancer cases in patients with disabilities and all
incident cancer cases about 27-31% of the colorectal, lung or prostate cancer patients in the
SEER-Medicare dataset had disabilities at the time of cancer diagnosis. Therefore, the proposed
research will shed light on how modelling a minority population differs from modelling the whole
population in a real-world dataset using our novel ML algorithms. Thus, it is a direct extension of
parent grant’s Aim 1.2 that focuses on impact of imbalanced label-distribution.
 There are four major barriers that we feel significantly limit the research and career
potential of the candidate, who is an Early Stage Investigator (ESI) and has a documented
disability. Without this supplement focusing on these barriers, she will unlikely successfully
compete for a R01 grant or become an independent investigator. Upon completion of this
supplement, we expect to overcome the four major barriers, build a solid research foundation and
generate ample preliminary data to successfully compete for R01 grants."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer among men and women in the U.S., leading to
over 50,000 deaths per year. Research aimed at reducing CRC’s high burden, discovering/validating novel
biomarkers associated with prognosis, addressing the growing epidemic of early-onset CRC, and countering
CRC disparities in underserved populations is of pressing importance. CRC patient cohorts that include diverse
populations and longitudinally ascertain clinical data and biospecimens are essential for pursuing these critical
objectives. The ColoCare Study is a large, multi-institutional prospective survivorship cohort that enrolls newly
diagnosed patients with CRC from diverse racial/ethnic and geographic backgrounds. CRC survivorship
cohorts are rare and ColoCare is unique given its collection of detailed epidemiologic and clinical data and a
variety of biospecimens at multiple time points. This design enables innovative survivorship research that
spans lifestyle/behavioral factors, racial/ethnic CRC disparities, and translational studies aimed at discovering
and validating novel molecular, blood- and microbiome-based biomarkers related to the risk of adverse CRC
outcomes. Such research can inform treatment decision-making, interventions aimed at improving key clinical
and patient reported outcomes, and the development of novel therapeutics.
 The ColoCare Study has enrolled >3,000 patients with a median of 2.1 years of follow-up and biospecimen
collections including tumor tissue and serial blood, stool, and urine samples. Despite being a young cohort,
ColoCare has already supported 70 published papers and 79 projects that include 72 external investigators.
Continued U01 infrastructure support is critical to sustain and grow this valuable resource for CRC survivorship
research. Here, we will pursue the following aims: (1) Increase the size of the cohort from 3,361 to 4,157
participants, including enhanced recruitment of underserved and understudied populations who experience
significant disparities in CRC outcomes, and patients receiving novel therapies. (2) Extend participant follow-up
to 5-years through both active follow-up (biospecimens; questionnaires; medical record abstractions) and
passive follow-up (SEER/state cancer registries and National Death Index). (3) Maintain and expand the
ColoCare biorepository, including collection of tumor tissue samples and longitudinal collections of blood and
stool samples. (4) Maintain and expand the ColoCare Central Data Warehouse, the capabilities of our study
portal to encourage and facilitate requests from external and internal investigators, and engagement with our
Community Advisory Board to advance patient participation and the public dissemination of knowledge
generated by ColoCare. With continued infrastructure support, this unique and comprehensive resource will
continue to enable a wide-range of impactful colorectal cancer survivorship research."

People with HIV (PWH) are living longer and healthier lives thanks to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).
However, they are experiencing an increased risk for non-AIDS–defining cancers. About 10% of deaths in PWH
in the U.S. are now due to non–AIDS-defining cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Non-small
Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Immunotherapy using Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) has improved outcomes
of HCC and NSCLC in the general population, but outcomes in PWH are less clear. The tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) in HCC and NSCLC is characterized by high levels of tumor-associated plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (TApDCs), which contribute to immunosuppression and promote tumor growth. In PWH, even in
those treated with cART, circulating pDCs induce the killing of T cells, reducing their infiltration into tumors and
immunotherapeutic potential. Our long-term goals are to study functions of TApDCs in TIME of HIV-associated
HCC and NSCLC, and to develop novel therapeutics to treat such cancers in PWH. This project is based on our
extensive experience and preliminary results, including the following. i) pDC depletion in HIV-infected humanized
mice rescued anti-HIV CD8+ T cells to control HIV persistence. ii) pDC depletion resolved inflammation, reversed
immune exhaustion and rescued activity of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. iii) In humanized NSG mice with human
immune cells and liver tumor (HCC-HIT mice), TApDC enhanced human tumor growth, associated with
accumulation of TA-Treg and exhausted CD8 T cells. iv) Depletion of human TApDC in HCC-HIT mice reduced
HCC growth, rescued stem-like CD8 T cells in number and functions, and decreased TA-Tregs. We hypothesize
that the effects of TApDC in TIME are exacerbated by HIV (even during cART) and contribute to more severe
immune suppression or resistance to PD1 ICI immunotherapy. Depletion of TApDC will reprogram TIME to
reduce TA-Treg and rescue anti-tumor T cells that respond to PD-1 ICI therapy. We have established two
humanized mouse models that support HIV infection and human liver cancer (HCC-HIT mice, Drs. Geng and
Su) or human lung cancer (NSCLC-HIT mice, Dr. Heredia). We propose to 1) study how HIV infection affects
tumor growth and TApDC/TIME in HCC and NSCLC and 2) to investigate how TApDC interact with ICIs to control
tumors in HCC-/NSCLC-HIT mice. We will achieve the following milestones in the two years: (i) characterization
of HCC/NSCLC TIME including HIV-enhanced TApDC to suppress T cells and exacerbate tumor growth; and (ii)
preclinical testing of TApDC depletion alone and in combination with PD1 ICI in HCC (HCC-HIT mice) and
NSCLC (NSCLC-HIT mice) with HIV infection. This will set the foundation to establish a strong program in
studying HIV-associated cancers in the UMGCCC. Findings from the project will have a great impact on our
understanding of TApDC in HCC/NSCLC TIME, HIV-induced mechanisms of cancer promotion, and on
discovering a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC/NSCLC in PWH. Key findings will also lead to future clinical
studies of HCC and NSCLC in both PWH and the general population."
11065219,"The female reproductive system ages before any other physiological system, making it the most sensitive
indicator of aging. Most women experience reproductive senescence around age 51, but many women
experience early reproductive aging (early menopause). This is a serious public health problem because early
reproductive aging is associated with early onset of infertility and increased risk of several diseases and early
death. Further, the consequences of early reproductive senescence are significant in women who delay
childbirth for personal and professional reasons. Despite the profound impact of early reproductive aging on
women’s health, little is known about the mechanisms underlying early reproductive aging. Our published and
preliminary data indicate that acute exposure to the environmental chemicals, di-(2-ethyhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP), during adulthood increases several key indicators of early reproductive aging
in female mice. Further, published data indicate that activation of the inflammasome and inflammation are
hallmarks of reproductive aging and our preliminary data indicate that DEHP exposure increases inflammatory
macrophages in the hypothalamus, DEHP and DiNP exposure increase expression of inflammatory pathways in
the ovary, and DEHP activates resident macrophages in the peritoneal cavity. In addition, published studies
indicate that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) plays an important role in regulating reproductive aging and
our preliminary data indicate that DEHP and its metabolite (MEHP) induce expression of the known AhR targets
in the pituitary and the ovary and that a specific AhR antagonist rescues ovarian follicles from phthalate-induced
inhibition of follicle growth. These impacts of phthalate exposure are of concern because phthalates are one of
the top contaminants present in human tissues and they are present in a myriad of consumer products, personal
care products, pesticides, wood finishes, adhesives, solvents, lubricants, defoaming agents, and medical
devices. Given our preliminary data, the importance of reproductive aging for reproductive health, and the
ubiquitous exposure of humans to phthalates, we propose to use mice to test the hypothesis that environmentally
relevant doses of DEHP and DiNP interact with the AhR pathway to cause inflammation and facilitate early
reproductive aging. To test this hypothesis, we will complete the following specific aims:1) compare the effects
of acute versus chronic exposure to environmentally relevant doses of DEHP and DiNP on the onset and
characteristics of reproductive aging, 2) determine if environmentally relevant phthalate exposure causes
inflammation, leading to early reproductive aging, and 3) determine if phthalates work through the AhR pathway
to cause early reproductive aging. Collectively, the proposed studies will greatly improve our understanding of
the mechanisms by which phthalate exposure causes early female reproductive aging. In turn, this work will set
the foundation for the identification and development of novel targets for the treatment of phthalate-induced
diseases, including early reproductive aging."

 Zebrafish, involved in research projects totalling over 450 million dollars of NIH funding in 2020, are the
fastest growing animal model of human disease in medical research today. Thus, the health and wellbeing of
medical research fish is paramount as the rigor and repeatability of experiments depends on it. Innovation in
zebrafish husbandry systems is crucially needed because current state-of-the-art non intrusive systems only
track water quality measures. No commercial husbandry system has adopted automatic monitoring of fish
behavior using video, despite the fact that most factors crucial in assessing fish health and well being, such as
hunger, anxiety, or light changes, produce well known behavioral signatures that a computer vision system
could detect. Because many such signatures require high temporal resolution, milliseconds in the case of
escape movements, video monitoring has been hampered by the need to create and process enormous data
volumes. Here, the proposed effort aims at building upon our Phase I success of prototyping the
proof-of-concept system codenamed “CanaryTanks”. We have installed CanaryTank with sentinel zebrafish
populations directly into the racks of an existing fish facility and used our original ""Remanent Imaging""
paradigm to monitor and analyze fish swimming behavior. The system is capable of producing email reports of
basic measures of activity, sleep and feeding as well as alerts when light cycles are disrupted.
 In this Phase II effort, we will improve our initial designs with commercialization in mind. The first aim builds
on our current design to improve deployability and enhance behavior detection capabilities by capturing 3D
data with a single camera. The second aim is (1) to enhance our system’s ability to build rich email reports and
a dashboard for users to explore and replay events as well as historical data, and (2) to develop advanced
detection and diagnostic algorithms using machine learning techniques. Sharing of curated data and analysis
techniques to the community is also planned in this effort. The future vision is that the CanaryTank technology
sets new standards in fish husbandry, real-time classification of complex behavior changes, and provides
revolutionary, ubiquitous in-tank recording capabilities that can be leveraged beyond husbandry for collection of
actual scientific experimental data."

Oligonucleotides face several biopharmaceutical difficulties, including stability and delivery issues as well
as non-hybridization activities such as coagulopathy and unwanted activation of the immune system. We
have developed a unique oligonucleotide delivery system, termed pacDNA, which uses a high-density
bottlebrush polymer to provide oligonucleotides with binding selectivity. The polymer amounts to an
entropic barrier, reducing access to the oligonucleotide by various proteins (and thus side effects) but still
allows for unhindered hybridization. This novel strategy not only improves nuclease stability, preserves
target-binding capability, and minimizes off-target side effects, but also massively enhances plasma
pharmacokinetics, tissue retention, and antisense potency in vivo. Our current studies also reveal that the
pacDNA’s pharmacological properties are intimately related to the bottlebrush backbone. In addition, the
pacDNA appears to be uniquely capable of evading anti-carrier adaptive immunity, which is useful for
therapies that requires long-term/frequent dosing. Finally, the pacDNA deposits into tissues and organs
that lack mature delivery technologies for, such as the skin, the skeletal muscle, and the heart. These
surprising and enabling discoveries will be the basis for investigations in the next funding period, in which
we will 1) explore the property space of the pacDNA structure using a combinatorial polymer library with
specific backbone compositions and monomer sequences, and 2) probe in vivo properties of the pacDNA
in mice. We anticipate that accomplishment of these objectives will yield significant fundamental
understanding of this class of materials and bring us much closer to clinical evaluation of pacDNA."
11053826,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
After menarche, females are twice as likely to develop depression and sleep problems than males. Ovarian
steroids have been hypothesized to play a role, but prior work has failed to clarify the effect of ovarian steroids
on mood and sleep problems. Hormone sensitivity (neural vulnerability to normal fluctuations in hormones
across the menstrual cycle) is a promising candidate, particularly sensitivity to estrogen withdrawal (E2), but
little is known about hormone sensitivity in adolescents. This work is hindered by traditional statistical
approaches (multilevel modeling (MLM) with phase contrasts), as they rely on the assumption of a regular,
ovulatory cycle, which adolescents often do not have. The proposed study will characterize hormone sensitivity
in adolescents by collecting daily assessments of mood ratings, sleep (via self-report and actigraphy), and
ovarian steroid hormones (via dried urine strips) from 50 female adolescents, aged 11-14, at least one-year
post-menarche, with regular cycles (21-45 days) and elevated depressive symptoms. For adolescents with
ovulatory cycles, multilevel models (MLM) with phase contrasts will be used to evaluate menstrual cycle effects
on symptoms and sleep, and the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System (C-PASS) will be used to
identify clinically significant premenstrual exacerbation of symptoms (Aim 1). I hypothesize that depressive
symptoms and sleep problems will be higher in the perimenstrual phase of the cycle compared to all other
phases. Across the full sample, longitudinal network models will be used to address limitations of multilevel
modeling; networks of associations between E2, mood symptoms, and sleep problems across the cycle will be
estimated (Aim 2), with the hypothesis that decreases in E2 will be associated with subsequent increases in
sleep problems followed by increases in mood symptoms. Exploratory analyses estimate the indirect effect of
E2 on mood symptoms via sleep problems (Aim 3). This knowledge could facilitate earlier identification and
prevention efforts and lay the groundwork for future research on the developmental contribution of hormone
sensitivity to sex differences in depression and sleep problems. The training plan closely matches the
proposed research and long-term goals with an emphasis on activities that will facilitate the candidate’s
development as an independent investigator. Specifically, the training goals are to (1) gain immersive training
in research on the menstrual cycle and hormone sensitivity with adolescents, (2) develop competence in the
assessment of sleep via actigraphy and self-report in adolescents, and (3) gain proficiency in idiographic
longitudinal methods for use with menstrual cycle data. A mentorship team with expertise across these areas
has been assembled, and Brown University is a world-renowned clinical research institution with an extensive
history of NIH funding and supporting career development awards. Overall, the broad aim of these research
and training goals is to support the candidate’s development of an independent research program examining
the biological mechanisms of the sex differences in depression and sleep problems that emerge after puberty."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development application (K23) will provide protected time for
Dr. Matison McCool to strengthen his trajectory as an independent researcher at the University of New Mexico,
Center on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions (CASAA). His goal is to develop expertise in mindfulness-
based interventions, heart rate variability (HRV), advanced quantitative methods, wearable sensors, and
other mobile health approaches to help improve, adapt, and develop interventions for alcohol use disorder
(AUD). To develop expertise in these areas, the candidate proposes an innovative, mentored research study
using wearable sensors to collect psychophysiological HRV data before and after each mindfulness-based
relapse prevention (MBRP) treatment session. The weekly HRV data is coupled with an ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) protocol to examine the addiction cycle in daily life. This study builds on
existing literature suggesting that mindfulness-based interventions induce changes in HRV by focusing on
measuring HRV epochs weekly throughout treatment, instead of pre-post treatment only, and assessing the
effect of HRV on the relationship between negative affect, craving, and alcohol use (consistent with NIAAA
FY 2017-2021 Strategic Plan Goal 4). Combining multiple HRV measurement occasions with EMA data
collection in a longitudinal structural equation modeling framework, this study provides training in basic science
to understand HRV, and how the results may improve MBRP, and inform adaptations of MBRP for adaptive
interventions (consistent with NIAAA Strategic Plan Goal 4 Objectives 4a and 4d). This mentored study will
offer training to help the candidate develop expertise to establish his own independent research program
examining mobile health adaptations of mindfulness-based interventions and their components while utilizing
sensors to prompt treatment and assess treatment component effectiveness. With the guidance of his training
team, Dr. McCool’s training plan and mentored study are integrated and selected to promote the development
of a comprehensive skillset in the following areas: 1) mindfulness-based interventions for AUD (Dr. Witkiewitz;
UNM) 2) basic psychophysiological science related to HRV and AUD (Dr. Eddie, Harvard; Dr. Buckman,
Rutgers), 3) advanced quantitative skills (Dr. Pearson, UNM; Dr. Witkiewitz), 4) wearable sensors and other
advanced mobile health technologies (Dr. Schwebel, UNM; Dr. Eddie), and 5) professional development,
dissemination, grantsmanship, and the responsible conduct of research (Drs. Witkiewitz, Pearson, Schwebel,
Eddie, and Buckman). Dr. McCool will visit Dr. Buckman’s lab at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and
complete training across the country. Through this training, Dr. McCool will be prepared to develop an
independent research career as a scientist who conducts patient-oriented research and will generate
substantial preliminary data for subsequent grant applications as an independent investigator."
11058036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurometabolic diseases encompass a wide range of more than 1600 genetic conditions caused by a
metabolic defect that results in significant neurological deficits. The incidence is estimated to be 1 in 800 births
and the number of reported cases is increasing every year largely due to the advancements in genetic
diagnostics. The natural course of these conditions is primarily progressive, and without effective interventions,
patients experience a decline in neurological function, frequently resulting in premature mortality. Despite the
magnitude of the problem, available information about these diseases is scattered (often a list of facts or long
tables), is not publicly accessible for meta-analysis or integration with third-party sites, and it is unavailable for
quantification of underlying annotation. This lack of accessible and structured information exacerbates the
challenge faced by physicians, including neurologists, psychiatrists, and general practitioners, who often do not
receive formal training in neurometabolism. Consequently, patients often find themselves taking multiple
medications to address a single deficit, thereby accumulating side effects, perpetuating unresolved symptoms,
and increasing suffering. Basic science research in this field has also suffered from neglect due mostly to the
lack of validated databases and epidemiological information on these conditions. There is, therefore, a need to
create a smart online platform for all neurometabolic diseases that is accessible to anyone, easy to use, and
user friendly. We will focus the first version of the platform on physicians and scientists. There are three reasons
for it: firstly, the platform will fulfil an area of unmet need in terms of understanding, patient management, and
research in these conditions. Secondly, doctors and scientists will be able to contribute to the development,
curation, and expansion of the database. And thirdly, targeting this user group is feasible within the time and
financial support of the R03. To develop this platform, we propose two aims: (1) the development of a
comprehensive database that includes clinical, biochemical, radiological, and therapeutic data on all known
neurometabolic diseases; and (2) the creation of an intuitive, clinically oriented web application. Our
multidisciplinary team comprises experts in clinical neurometabolism, chemical analysis, bioinformatics, and
software engineering, who have already developed a suite of 16 web applications for neurometabolic and clinical
data analysis. These tools are part of our Neurometabolomics & Neuroinformatics Core at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai. This initiative is poised to significantly enhance understanding, clinical management,
and mechanistic insight into neurometabolic diseases. Its innovative nature lies in its status as the first
comprehensive, open-source, and intuitive online infrastructure dedicated exclusively to these conditions. The
platform's value is expected to translate into tangible benefits for this underserved patient population, improving
both care and outcomes."
11061470,"Early onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC), defined as disease onset in individuals younger than 50 years, is an
emerging, deadly public health threat in the United States. Because the colon contains a densely populated
microbial ecosystem, it is hypothesized that the intimate association of colonic epithelial cells with the microbiota
can contribute to the initiation and/or progression of human CRC. However, as yet, no studies investigating the
microbiota/microbiome of patients with EO-CRC have been reported. Our group has identified that colon mucus-
invasive bacterial biofilms are common on CRCs occurring in those older than 50 (termed late onset CRC, LO-
CRC). We have demonstrated that LO-CRC-associated bacterial biofilms induce colon tumors in susceptible
mouse models. Further, our preliminary data now support our hypothesis that biofilms are common on EO-CRC.
Herein, we will test the hypothesis that individuals with EO-CRC display microbial and colonic epithelial
signatures that differ from age-matched controls. In our distinct, but complementary, Specific Aims, we will
trace the epidemiology of biofilm formation on CRCs for the past 35 years, test the antibody responses of EO-
CRC patients and comparator disease and control groups to biofilm and other microbes and determine if
microbial exposures induce changes in colon epithelial biology that lower the threshold for colon epithelial cell
neoplastic transformation. Using retrospective and prospective human cohorts, our Specific Aims are: 1) to
determine the longitudinal association of biofilm structure and composition with EO-CRC defined by all bacterial
and multiprobe fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; 2) to characterize
the binding of serum antibodies of EO-CRC patients to a broad array of environmental organism-associated
antigens (e.g., viral, phage, biofilm bacterial and/or bacterial toxin) via programmable phage display-based
profiling (known as PhIP-Seq); and, 3) to define the molecular signatures of normal EO-CRC epithelium with
known biofilm status through genome-wide methylation studies and the environmental stress responses of
normal human colonoids derived from EO-CRC, LO-CRC and healthy persons. Our results will provide insight
into the microbial associations and colon epithelial cell mechanisms that we predict potentiate EO-CRC,
with the ultimate goal of informing and accelerating novel strategies for EO-CRC detection, prevention
and intervention."
11065115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Worldwide, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is treated with curative intent, regardless of HIV status. In South Africa, at
least 40% of people living with HIV (PWH) with HL and marrow involvement do not survive until diagnosis. For
those that survive long enough for a diagnosis to be pathologically confirmed, secondary hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) appears to be a significant contributor to the high mortality and a cause of
considerable morbidity resulting in poor outcomes. Strategies to improve the diagnosis of HL in this population
are desperately needed. In a cohort of HIV-associated HL in South Africa, a marked elevation of ferritin was seen
at time of diagnosis and was associated with known poor prognostic factors, raising the question as to whether
a marked elevation of ferritin could be useful in prioritizing HL diagnosis in this setting. While HL is not the only
trigger associated with HLH in Johannesburg (or an elevation in serum ferritin), it was associated with over 44%
of suspected HLH cases referred to Hematology. Co-infection with TB in PWH and HL is also a considerable
concern in South Africa, however one of the most widely used diagnostic tests for disseminated TB has only
modest sensitivity (~50%). Having a biomarker that can help identify patients early for prioritized HL diagnosis
could result in lives saved. Additionally, this biomarker could help identify patients at high risk for early mortality.
Several future clinical trials could be considered for this population including: 1) Empiric TB treatment if ferritin
is markedly elevated 2) Frontline clinical trial of immunotherapy to aid in the management of both HLH and HL
3) Incorporation of JAK-inhibitors (i.e. Ruxolitinib) into the upfront treatment regimen to help manage co-existing
HLH. We acknowledge the drawbacks of ferritin given that it is a non-specific marker of inflammation. The benefit
of serum ferritin is that it is readily available in low resource settings. In this proposal, by utilizing data from an
existing cohort of lymphoma patients and stored specimens from a pneumonia cohort study, we will better
understand the levels of ferritin elevation seen in other subtypes of lymphoma, other EBV-associated tumors,
PWH and disseminated TB and PWH admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. Our overarching goal is to show
that extreme elevations in ferritin, that do not respond to initial treatment regimens (i.e antibiotics or TB therapy),
should raise the suspicion of HL in PWH."

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of membrane receptors in human and have emerged
as the largest family of drug targets with more than 35% of all drugs on the market functioning through GPCRs.
Despite their desirability, to date, many GPCR families remain undrugged, partly due to lack of mechanistic
knowledge about their activation and modulation. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are members of
class C GPCRs and are critical modulators of glutamate signaling. Due to their widespread expression in tissue
and their central role they are among the most promising drug targets for the neurological disorders such as
fragile X syndrome, epilepsy, anxiety, schizophrenia as well as some cancers. Advances in protein engineering
and functional, structural and computational methods in the past twenty years have provided insights into the
architecture, signaling and expression patterns of mGluRs. However, a general model of how ligands change
the shape of mGluRs and how this conformational change is relayed across the membrane and over 12 nm to
activate specific signaling pathways is poorly understood. In this research we will develop a novel technology
that will allow us to watch a single mGluR protein while functioning in physiological conditions, in real time. This
will allow us to quantify the motions of different domains of the receptor that are involved in signaling. Next, we
will employ this approach to study how cholesterol and synthetic modulators of mGluR signaling affect protein
conformation and dynamics to affect receptor signaling. This is a multi-disciplinary proposal where state-of-the-
art in vitro single-molecule FRET (smFRET) spectroscopy is complemented by live-cell imaging, protein
engineering and biophysical and biochemical methods. Once accomplished, the proposed research could
provide a critical step towards rational design of efficient drugs with fewer undesirable side effects. Furthermore,
these studies will provide a general roadmap for quantitative high-resolution structure-function studies of
mammalian membrane proteins."
11063904,"Resting CD4+ T cells form a reservoir capable of refueling HIV viremia when treatment is stopped. This is a
major barrier to an HIV cure. Resting CD4+ T cells can be divided into naïve and memory subtypes. It was
previously thought that naïve T cells formed a negligible portion of the reservoir, as the total amount of HIV DNA
in the naïve pool is small. We have shown, however, that there is relatively more intact than defective HIV DNA
in the naïve T cells compared to memory T cell subsets. In fact, in chronic progressors with X4 tropic virus, naïve
are often the major contributor to the HIV reservoir. Moreover, the integration sites and proviral sequences of
the HIV DNA in naïve cells are more diverse than in the memory subsets, indicating that the proviruses originated
from many different infection events. Naïve T cells have a much longer lifespan than memory T cells, higher
proliferative potential, and apparent resistance to clearance, which suggest that this naïve T cell reservoir is
capable of repopulating the HIV reservoir. The formation of the naïve reservoir by CCR5-tropic viruses is still
somewhat mysterious, as naïve cells in the blood do not usually express the CCR5 co-receptor, but preliminary
data shows that naïve cells in lymphoid tissues show different expression patterns, including occasional
expression of CCR5. Overall objective: We will quantify the contribution of naïve cells to the reservoir in donors
that represent a spectrum of reservoir size (Aim 1). We exploit our exciting finding that elite controllers have
nearly absent naïve T cell infection, while naïve infection serves as a prognostic indicator in chronic progressors.
We will dissect the heterogeneous nature of naïve T cells, especially in lymphoid tissue, as has previously been
done for memory T cells using RNA sequencing (Aim 2). We will elucidate important naïve biology and determine
how naïve T cells become infected. Design and Methods: In Aim 1, led by Dr. O'Doherty, we quantify the
contribution of naïve T cells to the entire HIV reservoir in both size and diversity using sophisticated sequencing
techniques, unique bioinformatic approaches (Dr. Polson), and math modeling (Dr. Zurakowski). We will also
study the ability of naïve T cells to replenish the reservoir and evade the CTL clearance. In Aim 2, led by Dr.
Levy, we couple RNAseq with antibody barcoding to identify memory and naïve T cells with elevated levels of
CCR5. We will probe the mechanism of naïve cell infection by infecting subset and bulk T cells from lymphoid
tissue and blood. We will determine viral tropism phenotypically, and monitor for reversion to naïve phenotype
ex vivo. These studies will also provide insights into the signaling pathways that distinguish naïve T cell subsets,
and that determine their susceptibility to HIV. The premise of our proposal is largely based on our prior work that
has shone a light on the role of naïve T cells and simultaneously provided insights into why these cells have
previously been ignored. This proposal may lead to a greater focus on naïve T cell infection, as these cells are
well-suited to hide proviruses. Focused attention on this entirely different cell type will be necessary to eradicate
HIV."
11049354,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid crisis continues despite the availability of several FDA approved medications for treating opioid
abuse and overdose. This public health crisis has worsened significantly over the past several years with the
COVID-19 pandemic and the increased availability of fentanyl and related ultra-potent analogs. Recently, there
has been a marked rise in overdose deaths involving opioids and xylazine, a non-opioid with sedative,
analgesic, and muscle relaxant properties and authorized only for veterinary use. It remains unclear why use of
opioid/xylazine mixtures has increased so rapidly. Use of xylazine might be intentional in some situations but
not others as it is commonly found as an adulterant in other drugs. Having agonist properties at alpha-2
adrenergic receptors, xylazine decreases release of norepinephrine and dopamine, and causes drowsiness,
hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, respiratory depression, and coma as well as soft tissue damage that
can lead to necrotic skin lesions. Xylazine shares many effects with opioids, increasing the risk of adverse
effects, including fatal overdose, when combined with an opioid. Anecdotal reports suggest that xylazine
enhances the reinforcing and subjective effects of opioids and diminishes the severity of opioid withdrawal
which might contribute to increased use; however, these hypotheses have not been tested experimentally. In
the case of overdose, treatment with naloxone (Narcan®) blocks only the effects of the opioid, thus additional
measures are required to successfully treat opioid/xylazine overdose. Repeated exposure to xylazine might also
lead to physical dependence and withdrawal, and it remains unclear whether xylazine alters opioid withdrawal.
Though medications are approved for reversing effects of xylazine in veterinary care, there are currently no
approved medications for treating xylazine overdose or withdrawal in humans. Proposed studies use well-
established methods and a highly translational species to improve our understanding of interactions between
opioids and xylazine as well as to elucidate factors contributing to the use of opioid/xylazine mixtures, which
will help to drive the discovery of safe and effective treatments."
11051453,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stimulant use disorders (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine) are a major public health concern. Despite a
heritability of ~40-50%, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified very few loci, including one hit
for cocaine (COC) dependence that maps to FAM53B, a gene also identified via expression quantitative trait
locus (QTL) analysis to be associated with COC self-administration in mice. The primary objective is to rapidly
identify novel genetic factors in rats that contribute to premorbid risk (compulsivity, impulsivity) and
cocaine use traits in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) reduced complexity cross (RCC). A rodent
systems genetics approach triangulates on discovery-based genetic and multi-level functional genomic analysis
and can provide a more rapid genetic and neurobiological insight into drug action and neuroplasticity underlying
addiction. For several years, the contact PI has been employing mouse reduced complexity crosses (RCCs)
between near-isogenic inbred substrains to facilitate gene mapping, validation, and mechanisms. Because
rodent substrains are > 99% genetically identical and contain several orders of magnitude fewer variants
compared to classical inbred strains, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in RCCs yields orders of magnitude
fewer causal candidate genes to consider. When combined with functional genomics, RCCs can rapidly lead to
causal gene and variant identification. Our preliminary studies establish robust, heritable differences in premorbid
impulsivity and compulsivity, sucrose reward sensitivity, and multiple COC use traits between SHR/NCrl and
SHR/NHsd substrains, including COC-induced locomotor activity, COC IVSA taking, seeking, and intake cycles,
demonstrating feasibility for gene mapping in an RCC. In Aims 1 and 2, we will pioneer the use of a rat RCC
where we will conduct whole genome sequencing (WGS) and map behavioral QTLs and expression QTLs
(eQTLs) from nucleus accumbens (NAC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the whole transcript and exon levels in
an F2 cross comprising COC-trained versus yoked saline (SAL)-trained rats. In Aim 3, we will conduct proteomic
analysis of PFC and NAC from COC vs. yoked SAL-trained rats to triangulate on high confidence candidate
quantitative trait genes (QTGs) and variants (QTVs) as we build functional connections between DNA variants,
transcriptional regulation, protein translation, and cell signaling adaptations underlying premorbid and cocaine
use traits. These studies pioneer the use of a rat RCC combined with deep behavioral phenotyping to rapidly
identify high-confidence candidate novel genetic factors and molecular mechanisms influencing premorbid risk
factors and cocaine use traits. Future gene editing of candidate causal gene variants will be modeled on the two
near-isogenic SHR backgrounds to demonstrate necessity (mutation correction; “rescue”) and sufficiency
(mutation induction). Deliverables include WGS’s of SHR substrains for future RCCs for complex trait analysis
as well as adaptive rat transcriptomic and proteomic datasets in key brain regions of the mesocorticolimbic
circuitry that can be further mined by investigators and hopefully inform therapeutics."
11055849,"Stoppel’s NIH NIGMS MIRA: 1 R35GM147041-01: Leveraging biodiversity and utilizing genetic
engineering to expand the structure and function of silk fibroin biopolymers for biomedical
applications
Project Summary for R35GM147041-01
Materials for applications in healthcare and medicine usually come from two main groups (a) synthetic polymers
specifically designed to achieve a certain goal or (b) naturally derived biopolymers that are leveraged in their
native or slightly modified state for a specific goal. The advantage of being a synthetic chemist is that technically,
if you can synthesize it, the possibilities are infinite, but the downfall is that often solvents or portions of the
polymer cause cytocompatibility issues or concerns when it comes to translation and implantation in a human.
Alternatively, unmodified natural biopolymers, or proteins, have an easier path toward Food and Drug
Administration’s approval, but lack the customizability afforded in synthesis or chemical modification. Genetic
engineering via production of small peptides in bacteria has improved the availability of customizable short
peptides, but proteins on the order of hundreds of kilodaltons cannot be consistently and reliably produced this
way. This is the case for the silk fibroin biopolymers isolated from caterpillars in the Lepidoptera order, where
the heavy chain of silk fibroin is known to be over 300 kilodaltons. Genetic engineering, using tools such as
CRISPR or PiggyBac, provides an avenue for theoretically modifying the sequence of silk proteins, which has
been attempted with limited success in the domesticated silkworm, Bombyx mori. However, silk is collected from
the cocoon of the B. mori pupae, meaning that the life cycle of this silkworm is interrupted, making it difficult to
maintain these modified populations or assess phenotypes in a high-throughput manner. To address this, silk
fibroin will be isolated from an entirely different silk-producing species: Plodia interpunctella (Indianmeal moth).
Under specific conditions, this agricultural pest produces sheets of silk prior to entering the cocooning phase.
These easily collectable sheets of silk fibers can then be cleaned, degummed, and regenerated to an aqueous
biopolymer solution. Moreover, unlike B. mori, P. interpunctella silk collection does not interrupt the life cycle of
the silkworm/moth and these silkworms are easier to stably genetically modify though embryo injections
compared to B. mori. In this Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award, genetic engineering will be leveraged to
modify the silk fibroin protein sequence at the organismal level, adding in new peptide sequences such as
mammalian cell binding motifs or sites for human growth factor sequestration. Scale-up of the process will be
achieved via transcriptional regulation of silk fibroin as a function of external stimuli such as humidity or
pathogens. Together, these two strategies for enhancing the bio-functionality of the silk fibroin protein and the
scale-up required for advanced manufacturing of medical devices or materials will be explored. The outcomes
of this work include full biophysical, biochemical, and in vivo characterization of these materials through analysis
of systemic and local immune responses in vivo, complete characterization of the new biopolymer structures,
and investigation of mechanotransduction in these materials in vitro. Future work aims to leverage this new class
of biopolymers for specific applications in pharmaceutical delivery, tissue engineering, and muscle rehabilitation."

11057120,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Relapse after abstinence is a key challenge for curbing the ongoing opioid epidemic. One of the common
factors for triggering relapse is re-exposure to drug-associated cues. In rats, cue-induced oxycodone seeking
progressively increases during abstinence. The Li Lab recently published work demonstrating a critical role of
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in this incubation. However, molecular mechanisms in OFC underlying this incubation
are largely unknown. Moreover, OFC is interconnected with several cortical and subcortical areas. Therefore,
the distinct molecular and cellular adaptations in these OFC-associated circuits may underlie the critical role of
OFC in oxycodone relapse. Despite recent developments in next-generation sequencing technology,
transcriptomic data still tell little about the proteome state due to the complex relationship between transcription
and translation, heterogeneous subcellular distributions of proteins (e.g., soma vs. axonal terminal), and other
factors. A key limitation to profiling projection-specific proteome has been due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive
bioanalytical technologies to quantify the deep proteome in the limited amounts of material available from somas
and axonal terminals, particularly using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), the modern technology of
choice for the discovery and/or targeted analysis of the proteome. The Nemes Lab developed ultrahigh-
sensitivity HRMS platforms that enabled the quantitative characterization of neuropeptides in distinct brain areas
of the mouse and thousands of different proteins in single stem cells, and has recently begun extending these
analytical innovations to single-cell-equivalent proteomes and single neurons in the mouse. In this proposal, we
aim to profile projection-specific proteome associated with incubation of oxycodone craving by focusing on
OFCdorsal striatum (DS) projections. We will profile proteome changes in OFCDS projection neuronal
somas in OFC (Aim 1) and in OFCDS projection-specific synaptoneurosomes in DS (Aim 2) during incubation
of oxycodone craving. Overall, this proposal will bring the ultrahigh sensitive quantitative HRMS to the field of
addiction neuroscience and may provide targets for pharmacological interventions to decrease craving and
promote abstinence."

Gun violence in the United States continues to be a persistent and growing public health threat with over 100
fatalities per day. Furthermore, gun violence is most pervasive in disadvantaged neighborhoods characterized
by disparities in race/ethnicity, poverty, educational attainment, among many other social determinants of health
(SDoH). The SDoH are highly dependent on where individuals live, work, and recreate. Therefore, the inherent
nexus between health and place should be explicitly considered when identifying, quantifying, and discussing
gun violence, which is one of the main contributions of this proposed project. My long-term career goal is to
become a leading interdisciplinary researcher in firearm injury and mortality prevention, investigating the spatial,
human behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of firearm risk and mortality. My K18 proposal
includes a career development plan and training activities that will expand my current expertise in spatial science
with advanced training in gun violence and health policy to complement my growing experience in these domains.
My mentoring team possess the expertise and interdisciplinary experience necessary to facilitate my training
goals and transition to an independent investigator in the intersection of gun violence and spatial science. My
proposed research, which leverages publicly available criminology, Census, and SDoH variables, will (1) develop
an analytical approach to detect emerging spatial-temporal clusters of gun violence incidents at the
neighborhood and weekly levels in Washington, D.C.; (2) develop a spatial-temporal regression model to
examine the impact of the social determinants of health (SDoH) and other place-based factors on gun violence
risk; and (3) examine potential spatial-temporal associations between gun violence incidents and alcohol outlet
access and hours of operation. Aim 1 hypothesizes that I will detect anomalous clusters of gun violence events
throughout the study area and period after adjusting for related covariates and baseline conditions. Aim 2
hypothesizes that (a) various disparities among the SDoH are strongly associated with gun violence risk and (b)
neighborhoods near high-risk areas will exhibit a spatial spillover effect. Aim 3 hypothesizes that (a) high-risk
areas of gun violence incidents can partly be explained by alcohol outlet access and (b) outlets with longer and
later operating hours significantly increase gun violence risk. The outcomes and frameworks from this research
on gun violence and its spatial and temporal determinants will inform other research across the United States,
inform policymakers, and provide the foundation for larger funded project applications (e.g., R01). Overall, this
project can improve our understanding of the SDoH, segregation, spatial and temporal interaction, and
relationships with other factors that are necessary to improve violence reduction programs and policy. My
mentoring team and I will leverage connections with programs and officials in Washington, D.C. to facilitate the
dissemination of key results and improved gun violence surveillance tools."

Radiation-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is a common immunotoxicity associated with radiotherapy (RT) or
chemoradiotherapy. Severe RIL (sRIL) has been shown to significantly impact patient survival and other outcomes. Most
recently, it has become evident that sRIL can also diminish the effectiveness of immunotherapy significantly, when used
in conjunction with RT. We have demonstrated that proton therapy, because of its smaller dose bath, can lead to
significant sparing of the immune system. Project 2 of the parent NCI P01 is exploring the dosimetric and clinical
determinants of RIL and correlation of RIL with patient outcomes, developing personalized machine learning RIL
prediction models, and investigating strategies to mitigate RIL for cancers of the esophagus, lung, brain, liver, and
pancreas. Our preliminary studies have suggested that the most effective RIL mitigation approach is the use of intensity-
modulated proton therapy (IMPT) optimized based on personalized RIL models. The purpose of the research proposed
in this supplement application is to develop a DTRO framework with the following objectives: (1) Incorporate the
response deduced from lymphocyte depletion rate after initial treatment fractions (up to 5) to dynamically boost the RIL
prediction accuracy for a given patient and adapt (reoptimize) the IMPT plan to minimize immune toxicity. (2) Validate
and dynamically update the personalized RIL prediction models based on continuous feedback from actual responses.
(3) Quantify uncertainties in model predictions and consider them when making treatment decisions. Specific Aims
include the following: (1) Deploy and evaluate a bi-directional feedback DTRO system between the physical and virtual
components of the Phase I clinical trial planned in Project 2 of the parent grant. (2) Amend the Phase I trial schema to
form a feedback loop to dynamically update the personalized models. (3) Conduct uncertainty quantification analyses to
establish confidence intervals around the model predictions and incorporate uncertainty estimates in decisions before
treatment start and again after adaptation and reoptimization based on the response to initial fractions. The proposed
trial will be implemented for a cohort of esophagus patients to investigate the potential of DTROs in general and the
clinical effectiveness of the RIL mitigation approach. Our research will utilize multiscale data, including patient clinical
characteristics, dosimetric parameters, adjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy details, and immune system biomarkers
for a large cohort of esophagus patients previously treated at our institution. Similar data will be collected for each
patient enrolled and treated prospectively in the DTRO-based trial. This research will be a collaborative effort among
radiation oncologists, radiation physicists and data scientists. Our ultimate objective is to gain a comprehensive
understanding of factors contributing to RIL incidence and severity. We will incorporate this knowledge to enhance the
accuracy of prediction models and apply them to optimize treatment plans and clinical decision-making. We anticipate
that this DTRO will lead to further improvements in outcomes beyond what is possible with the research proposed in the
parent P01. Concepts and models developed as part of this research will be made available for broader use."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative disease in older adults with the incidence rising rapidly
after age 50 and leveling off after age 70. OA is also one of the common causes of chronic pain and the
leading cause of physical disability in older adults. Currently, there is an unmet need for therapeutic strategies
to improve the outcome for patients with OA. Our latest work identifies a list of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human
cartilage and demonstrates a strong association with a robust anabolic effect. This effect is joint-specific and
follows a distal-proximal axis gradient (high in ankle and low in hip). Studies show that a joint's identity is
maintained by synovial cells and that there is a distinct miRNA profile in different joints. Together, this suggests
that the miRNAs we identified in cartilage may originate from synovium and be involved in maintaining joint
homeostasis. In Aim 1, I will determine the synovial cell types that express these regenerative miRNAs within
human joints and the effects of age on the expression of these miRNAs. In Aim 2, I will determine the signaling
pathways responsible for the miRNA-mediated anabolic effects in cartilage and the effects of age on these
pathways. I will conduct gene set enrichment analysis to determine miRNA-mediated pathways and then use
proteomics to validate these pathways. Through this project, I will determine the miRNA-mediated mechanisms
by which synovial cells promote endogenous anabolic effects in the human joint. The key career enhancement
of this award will be the training in computational bioinformatics to analyze the complex datasets generated by
the project, and further training in aging biology to understand how aging impacts the regeneration process. To
facilitate progress toward independence, the training plan will include the coursework/workshops in
computational bioinformatics and aging biology, extensive internal and external scientific meetings, and career
professional development activities and mentorship. The research and career development plan detailed in this
proposal will be conducted with a team of outstanding mentors. Dr. Yi-Ju Li, a professor of Biostatistics &
Bioinformatics and an expert in statistics and bioinformatics, will serve as the primary mentor and focus on the
training in bioinformatics, statistics, and professional skill development. Drs. Cathleen Colón -Emeric, Virginia
Kraus (Duke), and Patrik Önnerfjord (Lund University, Sweden) will serve as co-mentors; they will facilitate
training in translational aging research, OA research, and proteomics, respectively. The environment at the
Duke University and Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, where the main research activities are located, are
ideal for the research and training activities outlined in this proposal. This award will enable me to elucidate the
novel contributions of miRNAs to joint tissue homeostasis. Advancements in this area of research have the
potential to develop as new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the quality of life for patients with OA."

10937098,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Traumatic stress can lead to alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorder (AUD). In particular, avoidance coping after 
stress (i.e., persistent mental and/or physical avoidance of stress-related stimuli) is associated with higher rates of 
alcohol misuse. Using an animal model, we have shown that exposure to predator odor stress produces persistent 
avoidance of predator odor-paired stimuli in a subset of rats, termed ‘Avoiders’. Importantly, Avoider rats show long-lasting increases in alcohol self-administration after stress, similar to findings in humans. The neurobiology underlying 
this phenomenon remains an open area of investigation. This K99/R00 award includes a comprehensive career 
development and research plan based on Dr. Marcus Weera’s preliminary data showing that Avoider rats exhibit 
increased tolerance to the aversive effects of alcohol, which is hypothesized to facilitate increased alcohol self-administration in these rats. Our preliminary data also show that Avoider rats exhibit blunted activation of lateral 
habenula (LHb)-projecting lateral hypothalamus (LHA) neurons by aversive doses of alcohol. The scientific goal of this 
K99/R00 award is to test the central hypothesis that LHA-LHb neurons mediate stress-induced tolerance to alcohol 
aversion and stress-induced escalation of alcohol self-administration in Avoider rats via three aims. In Aim 1, we 
predict that Avoider rats show blunted activation of LHA-LHb and LHb neurons in response to an aversive dose of 
alcohol, as measured by Fos immunohistochemistry and in vivo fiber photometry. In Aim 2, we predict that in vivo 
chemogenetic stimulation of LHA-LHb neurons rescues stress-induced blunting of LHb activity and stress-induced 
tolerance to alcohol aversion in Avoider rats, as measured by in vivo fiber photometry and alcohol conditioned place 
aversion, respectively. In Aim 3, we predict that in vivo chemogenetic stimulation of LHA-LHb neurons rescues stress-induced blunting of LHb activity and stress-induced escalation of alcohol responding in Avoider rats, as measured by
in vivo fiber photometry and operant alcohol self-administration, respectively. Results from these studies will improve 
our understanding of the neural circuits underlying stress-induced changes in sensitivity to alcohol’s aversive effects 
and in alcohol self-administration. The career development goal of this K99/R00 award is to provide the principal 
investigator, Dr. Marcus Weera, with additional technical training and professional development, and to help him 
establish an independently-funded research program. During the K99 portion of the award, under the guidance of an 
expert team of mentors, Dr. Weera will expand his technical repertoire to include in vivo fiber photometry. He will also 
search for and secure a tenure-track faculty position. During the R00 portion of the award at his new institution, Dr. 
Weera will use his acquired skills to build upon these studies, gathering rigorous data for submission of an R01 
application. The work and training supported by this award will be critical for the PI’s successful transition to an 
independent research career studying the neurobiology underlying individual differences in stress and alcohol 
responsiveness."
10934626,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
The neuronal circuitry underlying motivational processes in adolescent models is understudied but clinically 
relevant because disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder, which are 
marked by alterations in motivation, emerge during adolescence. The frontal cortex and striatum are critical 
targets because they are amongst the last regions to mature. My previous work investigated how 
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-dorsomedial (DMS) circuits guide goal-directed processes and control response 
inhibition in adolescent and adult rats. Additionally, I investigated the impact of adolescent alcohol 
exposure on these networks. I found that adolescent alcohol exposure is associated with age-specific 
changes in OFC and DMS response to conditioned stimuli and reward. In a separate study, I recorded from 
dopamine neurons and observed that adolescents exhibited a larger phasic response to reward in a 
stimulus-driven task, while adults exhibit a larger response when reward is acquired during a goal-driven 
task. Collectively, these data suggest adolescent alcohol exposure promotes lasting changes in OFC-DMS 
circuits, and that adolescents and adults employ different computational strategies during reward-seeking, 
likely due to age-specific activity in cortical-striatal circuits. The proposed projects use a combination of 
computational modeling, chemogenetics and in vivo electrophysiology recordings to test the hypotheses 
that (1) developmental maturation is characterized by an enhanced ability to employ goal-directed control 
of behavior and (2) adolescent alcohol exposure causes pathology in neural circuits required for goaldirected control. These experiments will further elucidate the relationship between goal-directed processes, 
adolescent alcohol exposure and risk of addiction-related behaviors. Using previously acquired recordings 
of the OFC and DMS in adult and adolescent rats (K99), I will integrate experimental and computational 
approaches to model neural strategies underlying motivated behavior in adolescents and adults (Aim 1). 
Next, I will use chemogenetics to test the model predictions and determine causality between behavior and 
physiology (Aim 2). Lastly, I will determine how engagement of different computational strategies is 
impacted by adolescent alcohol exposure (Aim 3). These translational results will enhance our mechanistic 
and computational understanding of adolescent brain function which is fundamental for understanding the 
etiology and pathophysiology of disorders with an adolescent onset, such as addiction."
11052712,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTI), such as dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC), have high
antiviral potency against HIV-1, excellent safety and tolerability, and a high barrier to resistance. It is a high
priority to promote the availability and rational use of InSTI in adults and children with HIV, including
those with tuberculosis (TB). South Africa has the highest rates of HIV and TB co-infection in the world--
among patients with TB, 50-80% have HIV. Rifampicin (RIF), an essential first-line TB drug, is a potent inducer
of metabolizing enzymes and transporters, causing drug interactions that limit HIV-TB co-treatment options. In
adults, DTG, now recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) as the preferred first-line antiretroviral
for the treatment of HIV-1, can be given together with TB treatment, provided the dose is doubled (to 50 mg
twice daily) to mitigate the drug interaction. While DTG dosing has now been established for children down to a
weight of 20kg, no data exist to guide dosing for young children with TB on RIF-containing treatment. BIC, co-
formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF, Biktarvy®) was recently shown to be
non-inferior to DTG-based treatment, with no emergence of resistance in Phase 3 trials. However, no data
exist in patients with HIV-associated TB on BIC/FTC/TAF efficacy, safety, or pharmacokinetics (PK) when it is
given twice daily with RIF. In HIV-negative healthy volunteers, BIC trough concentrations were reduced by
80% with RIF (but remained 3-fold higher that the protein adjusted effective concentration (paEC95). In another
study, TAF even with RIF produced higher concentrations of intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), the
active moiety, than when tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) was given alone. The specific aims of the study
are therefore 1) To assess the efficacy, safety, and PK, of twice daily, co-formulated BIC 50mg/FTC
200mg/TAF 25mg in HIV positive ART-naïve adult patients with TB who are receiving a RIF-based regimen. 2)
To determine the PK and safety of DTG 50mg twice daily in children (20-35kg) who are taking a RIF-containing
regimen for the treatment of TB. The proposed studies are timely and will generate knowledge needed to
support evidence-based use of InSTI in adults and children with HIV-associated TB who are taking RIF-
based treatment. Both these studies are high impact. Firstly, South Africa and KwaZulu Natal in particular are
in the epicenter of the TB-HIV co-epidemic- the majority of patients with TB also have HIV. Secondly, there are
no data to support the safety and efficacy of Biktarvy® twice daily for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in
patients with TB on RIF co-treatment and it is unlikely that this potent, safe drug with a high genetic barrier to
resistance, that may provide effective future ART treatment options, will be made available in Africa if it cannot
be used in patients with TB. Thirdly, there are no published data to support dose recommendations for DTG
among children receiving TB treatment (particularly in the proposed weight-band). HIV-TB co-treatment options
are extremely limited in children, making this an area of critical unmet medical need."
11052886,"Project Summary: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that remains largely
incurable. Although the cause for this profound therapeutic resistance is poorly understood, it is however partly
blamed on signaling factors present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which supports the proliferation and
survival of neoplastic cells. Apart from being stroma rich, PDAC TME is associated with a distinctive tumor
immune infiltrate. Paradoxically, most immunotherapy trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors, either as
monotherapy or combination, failed to increase patient survival motivating exploration of new therapeutic
strategies. To that end, the cytokine mediated heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and immune cells
remain largely unexplored. In a recent study, we demonstrated that cytokines, IL4 and IL13, secreted by TH2
cells (a subtype of CD4+ T cells), provide trophic support for PDAC development. Mechanistically, inhibiting this
cytokine mediated crosstalk between cancer-TH2 cells either genetically or pharmacologically drastically reduces
tumor growth and increases survival in a preclinical model. Our subsequent preliminary work identified a potent
inflammatory cytokine, IL33 which is overexpressed and released by PDAC cells that attract and activate TH2
and other immune cells such as innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) and Tregs. Importantly, we found that the release
of IL33 by PDAC cells is mediated by intratumor mycobiome. Inhibition of IL33 or anti-fungal treatment leads to
a decrease in the infiltration and activation of type 2 immune cells (TH2 and ILC2) and Treg cells, accompanied
by significant PDAC tumor regression. Taking these observations together, we hypothesize that type 2 immune
response plays an important role in PDAC tumorigenesis and intratumor mycobiome is key to the IL33 secretion.
The major objective of this proposal is to elucidate the role of mycobiome in the IL33 mediated type 2 immune
response and provide pre-clinical evidence to guide future clinical studies with an anti-IL33 monoclonal antibody
in PDAC patients. To that end, we will determine the molecular mechanism of mycobiome mediated IL33 release
in cell and organoid models of PDAC. Further, to conduct a clinically relevant study, we will analyze IL33,
intratumor mycobiome and type 2 immunocytes in the PDAC patient tumor and serum samples. While our
preliminary studies using the syngeneic orthotopic model have shown a significant tumor regression upon IL33
deletion or anti-fungal treatment, synergistic combination strategies are expected to be even superior in efficacy.
So, we propose to use an anti-IL33 antibody in combination with anti-fungal treatment for superior efficacy.
Finally, to block the IL33-TH2/ILC2 axis we have three genetically engineered mouse models that will allow
rigorous testing of the function of IL33 in PDAC tumorigenesis. In conclusion, our study is poised to identify a
novel strategy to target PDAC patients and provide mechanistic insights for future clinical development of anti-
IL33 therapy."

I am a clinical psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and an Associate Professor at Harvard
Medical School. I also serve as Director of Suicide Research in the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
at MGH. The long-term goal of my research is to clarify risk processes and mechanisms underlying the onset
and recurrence of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors and depression in youth and young adults, with a
particular focus on state-sensitive and temporally delimited phenomena that may underlie short-term risk for
these outcomes. Through this work, I aim to advance our understanding from who is at risk to how and when
they are at risk for these clinical outcomes, thereby ultimately to improve preventive intervention strategies for
high-risk youth and young adult populations. I aim to pursue these goals and objectives directly through my
own patient-oriented research (POR) and more broadly through mentoring early career investigators in clinical
and translational research. I am currently PI on 2 R01-level grants and an MPI on another R01 and an R21, all
supported by the NIH and involving complementary evaluations of how stress-related processes place
vulnerable adolescents at heightened short-term risk for suicidal outcomes. In addition to my own research, I
currently serve on the training committee of the clinical psychology internship program at MGH, as well as
three T32 training programs within the Harvard system focused on suicide, youth mental health, and clinical
neuroscience. I have mentored 40 trainees thus far across all career stages, from high school students to early
career faculty (including 3 K23 awardees and 1 R01 awardee), in POR. The K24 award will provide me with
protected time (30%) to expand my mentorship activities with trainees pursuing careers in POR. It will also
allow for protected time (20%) to continuing and extending my POR, particularly with a focus on stress
processes in social media exchanges, as well as to acquire fundamental skills in natural language processing
to further this aim in my own work as well as that of my future mentees. Training opportunities will occur
primarily within the context of one of my active R01s (MH124899), with additional data pooled from my current
RF1 (MH120830). Both these grants involve ambulatory assessments of short-term risk for suicidal thoughts
and behaviors among adolescent psychiatric inpatients in the first month after discharge, a period of
particularly elevated risk for these outcomes. My recently completed R01 project, ongoing NIH-supported
research, and proposed new research within this K24 will provide mentorship opportunities focused on POR
with suicide and related outcomes. Finally, the K24 would provide me with training opportunities further
developing my mentorship and leadership skills to benefit future mentees in POR."

 Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to
remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this
procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence
of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential
pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular
cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an
important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our
team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial
and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint
degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in
the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is
unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before
and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall
hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the
joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are
combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined
clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.
 Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and
composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients
with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after
surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue
metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry.
Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage
degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors,
biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of
cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment
approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as
physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration."
11057548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by
hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum and pons that is often fatal within the first year of life. The cerebellum and
pons integrate information from sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain to regulate motor
movements, breathing, and learning motor behavior. Individuals with PCH1b show muscle atrophy/weakness,
microcephaly, and developmental delay. Most individuals with PCH1b do not live past childhood and current
treatment is purely palliative. Mutations that cause PCH1b occur in the EXOSC3 gene, which encodes a
structural cap subunit of an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed RNA processing complex, the
RNA exosome. The RNA exosome is a ribonuclease composed of both structural and catalytic subunits that play
a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNA. This complex is required for 3’ to 5’ processing and
degradation of a vast number of RNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Post-transcriptional processing of
RNA is a critical regulatory step in gene expression, as underscored by the number of neurological diseases
caused by defects in RNA processing factors. The tissue-specific phenotypes caused by the RNA exosome
complex are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited
analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. Thus, we aim to investigate the in vivo functional
consequences of distinct disease-causing amino acid substitutions in EXOSC3 that are linked to a range of mild
to severe phenotypes in PCH1b. We have generated an allelic series of EXOSC3 disease-linked missense
mutations in the Drosophila orthologue Rrp40 via CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology. Our previous work in flies
revealed an enhanced requirement for Rrp40 in neurons. Furthermore, our RNA-seq analysis of brain-enriched
transcriptomes of Rrp40 mutants revealed increases in steady-state levels of functionally important neuronal
transcripts, suggesting that disease-causing amino acid changes in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40
contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Our goal now is to characterize how disease-causing amino acid substitutions
in Rrp40 alter the molecular and cellular landscape of the developing nervous system in Drosophila in vivo. We
will test the hypothesis that the RNA exosome regulates RNAs that are critical for proper
neurodevelopment and function, a distinct subset of which are regulated by the RNA exosome cap
subunit Rrp40 (EXOSC3) through three complementary aims: 1) Assess the functional consequences of amino
acid substitutions in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40 corresponding to those that cause PCH1b; 2)
Interrogate how Rrp40 mutations affect expression and localization of key neuronal transcripts within the fly
brain; and 3) Exploit a genetic screen to determine whether aberrant accumulation of specific RNA exosome
targets disrupt fly development and/or homeostasis. Successful completion on these aims will provide a
synergistic understanding of RNA exosome biology and invaluable insights into PCH1b disease etiology."
11057325,"SUMMARY
 Transcription factors play essential roles in establishing the correct gene expression patterns
unique to each cell type. These finely controlled patterns can fall apart if a mutation resides within a
critical factor. In the hematopoietic system, this can lead to anemia, dysplasia, or leukemia of varying
morbidities. Overcoming transcription factor deficits is highly challenging, especially if the mutation is
solely in one of the two alleles and if complete removal of the protein’s expression is not an option.
Experiments in this proposal addresses the problem in the context of the congenital dyserythropoietic
anemia (CDA) caused by a single missense mutation in one allele of the KLF1(EKLF) transcription factor.
Technological development of state-of-the-art approaches to selectively target and degrade the mutant
variant will be designed and tested.
 Specifically, the method relies on the cellular introduction of degradative modules (degrons)
coupled to targeting motifs based on KLF1/DNA interactions, the details of which are to be based on
published and proposed methods of identifying parameters of binding selectivity.
 These studies, summarized in two Aims that cover (1) in vitro tests and (2) in vivo (cell culture)
approaches, will have a transformative effect well beyond the immediate case, as they provide an
innovative and distinctive blueprint for the direct removal of problematic proteins in other hematologic
and renal diseases caused by monoallelic missense mutations in transcription factor DNA binding
domains."

Parent project abstract:
A lack of knowledge about the initiating moments of tumorigenesis leaves large gaps in our ability to detect
cancer early or develop prevention strategies. Our primary objective of this competitive renewal is to define, in
vivo, the immediate consequences of oncogenic mutations in BRAF during Serrated colon cancer formation.
We will pursue these studies in colon stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of colon cancer. Work from the
previous grant identified new genetic modifiers of Serrated tumorigenesis. We found that oncogenic
BRAFV600E mutations paradoxically cause stem cells to differentiate rather than form tumors. However, when
we inactivated tumor suppressor transcription factors CDX2 or SMAD4, Serrated tumorigenesis was markedly
restored. Excitingly, we found that CDX2 and SMAD4 target genes can be used to stratify human patients for
their susceptibility to Serrated tumors. The logical extension of these studies is to understand the molecular
mechanisms that occur in stem cells in response to BRAFV600E mutations. We predict that pERK takes
advantage of accessible chromatin upon CDX2 loss. Aim 1 will compare the activity of pERK in wild type stem
cells, and BRAFV600E or CDX2-mutant stem cells. State-of-the-art –omics approaches will allow first-of-a-kind
measurements of pERK on stem cell chromatin, within hours after the BRAFV600E mutation is expressed from
its endogenous locus. We will measure pERK binding activity, nuclear localization, and dynamic interactions
with its protein partners. Aim 2 will look at the downstream gene regulatory consequences of the BRAFV600E
mutation in stem cells lacking SMAD4. We predict that SMAD4 works with pERK to promote differentiation and
suppress stem cell renewal. Epigenomics approaches will map pERK binding to the genome, and ATAC-seq
and RNA-seq will profile changes to chromatin and the transcriptome. Finally, Aim 3 will functionally test a
model that the injury/repair cycle in the colon can create a susceptible environment for BRAF-pERK to drive
tumorigenesis, with the prediction that an altered transcriptional network is permissive to Serrated tumor
formation during the injury/repair cycle. These studies would provide important pre-clinical models to help
explain and test therapeutic strategies to suppress Serrated tumor initiation in humans. These studies are
innovative with cutting edge -omics applications and GEMMs and significant in exploring untested mechanisms
of oncogenic pERK in stem cells. Successful completion of these studies will have us poised to test therapeutic
strategies for the prevention or early detection of Serrated Colon Cancer."

Gastric cancer (GC), the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide, is characterized both by
histologic and molecular criteria. The two most common forms include Diffuse GC (DGC) and
Intestinal GC (IGC). Each class of GC is associated with early inactivation of a distinct tumor
suppressor, DGC with CDH1 (encoding E-cadherin) and IGC with p53. Beyond genetic changes,
gastric cancer development is promoted by environmental factors, specifically Helicobacter
infection and exposure to dietary nitrates. We posit that addressing two fundamental questions
in the gastric cancer field, defining the cells of and defining the distinct mediators of progression,
should be addressed together given their interconnectedness. We will evaluate the interplay of
genetic and environmental precipitants to gastric cancer using novel engineered mouse models
where we can selectively target key tumor suppressors in the gastric epithelium in concert with
relevant exposures. We will then deeply interrogate tissues with the combination of multi-omic
single cell technologies enabling dual analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in
individual cells and the subsequent use of spatial transcriptomic tools allowing us to map features
of individual cell types spatially to refine the cellular origins of these altered cell types. In concert
to defining cellular origins of the two primary classes of gastric cancer, our integrated multi-omic
and spatial analyses will be evaluated to define changes in cellular programs and candidate
mediators of these altered phenotypes. Furthermore, we can define the interaction of
environmental exposures in gastric tumorigenesis. Subsequently, we will perform functional
validation of candidate mediators of progression, evaluating both features intrinsic to gastric
epithelial cells and those emerging from the microenvironment. These studies will both address
longstanding debates over origins of these cancers and define new targets to prevent cancer
development."

The purpose of this K99/R00 application is to provide support for Dr. Zachary Clayton, a promising post-
doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Douglas Seals. This additional research and training will allow him to
successfully transition into an independent investigator in the field of translational cardiovascular (CV)
physiology. As part of his proposed K99 training plan, he will learn new technical skills, enhance his intellectual
and professional skills and participate in various career development activities, including those that will help
establish him as a leader in the fields of cardio-oncology and cellular senescence. His proposed project seeks
to investigate the role of cellular senescence in regulating arterial dysfunction (i.e. the primary risk factor
for CV diseases [CVD]) with the common chemotherapeutic agent Doxorubicin (DOXO), first in mice (K99)
and later translating to mice and humans (R00). Senescent cells accumulate in the CV system following DOXO
and cellular senescence may exacerbate upstream regulators of arterial dysfunction (i.e. inflammation and
oxidative stress). Guided by strong preliminary data, Dr. Clayton will first (Aim 1) confirm that DOXO causes
arterial dysfunction via cellular senescence by utilizing complementary mouse models in which he can
systemically clear senescent cells. With guidance and training in technical skills from an internationally
recognized expert in cellular senescence, he will then (Aim 2) conduct innovative ex vivo cell culture
experiments in vascular cells to determine the role of cellular senescence in mediating key phenotypes
underlying arterial dysfunction, evoked by plasma from DOXO-treated mice. After transitioning to a faculty
position, Dr. Clayton will next (Aim 3; R00) translate his findings first to mice, by performing mouse-to-mouse
plasma exchange experiments to determine whether DOXO-mediated arterial dysfunction can be transferred
via the circulation and whether this response is dependent upon cellular senescence activation. Next, he will
extend his findings to humans by determining the role of plasma from DOXO-treated cancer patients in
facilitating arterial dysfunction-related phenotypes in cultured vascular cells. Overall, the proposed research
has the potential to address 2 strategic research priorities of NHLBI: 1) investigate new pathobiological
mechanisms important to the onset of CVD; 2) determine strategies for reducing vascular morbidity in cancer
survivors. The proposed projects will provide opportunities for future fundable research, culminating in
submission of a novel R01 during years 4-5 of this award. Dr. Seals (primary mentor) is an internationally
recognized and NIH funded scientist with a strong history of successful mentoring in translational CV research.
With his guidance and the guidance of co-mentor Dr. Judith Campisi, advisory team members Drs. Youngho
Bae, Thomas LaRocca, Saul Villeda, Lavanya Kondapalli, Kamali Kimdar and biostatistician Dr. Zhiying You,
Dr. Clayton will be able to successfully complete the proposed research and training plan and transition to an
independent, extramurally-funded tenure-track position at a top-tier (R1) research institution."
11063318,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Cellular Senescence is as an acquired state cells enter in response to environmental stressors or tumor
evasion. Senescent cells cease their proliferative capacity and enhance their ability to respond and regulate
the microenvironment through the senescence-associated secretory phonotype (SASP). Another shared
characteristic of cellular senescence is the upregulation of the tumor suppressor cyclin inhibitor p16INK4a. With
age there’s accumulation of senescence cells in tissues along with the upregulation of p16INK4a expression.
While removal of p16INK4a expressing cells using genetic mouse tools slows down aging, it also adversely
impacts wound healing during injury repair, suggesting contradictory roles of p16INK4a during homeostasis and
injury response. We generated an ultra-sensitive p16INK4a reporter mouse line name, named INK4A H2B-GFP
Reporter-In-Tandem, or INKBRITE to further understand in vivo p16INK4+ cells. In INKBRITE adult lungs,
p16INK4+ cells are predominantly within immune and fibroblasts populations. p16INK4+ fibroblasts express
features of senescence including polyploidy, increase in cell size, low proliferation capacity and ability to
promote airway epithelial cell growth after injury. My main goal is to determine if the capacity to promote
regeneration is restricted to airway p16INK4+ and epithelium or other regionally specific p16INK4 expressing
fibroblast can support epithelial growth. Whether the capacity to promote epithelial regeneration is restricted to
airway p16INK4+ fibroblasts or other spatially defined fibroblast subpopulations such as alveolar fibroblast can
promote epithelial growth through SASP, remains unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, I will isolate alveolar
p16INK4a+ fibroblasts and determine their capacity to promote epithelial growth after acute epithelial injury by 1)
ex vivo 3D co-culture assay, 2) identify the transcribed SASP through RNA sequencing, and 3) in vivo using
known senolytics Dasatinib and Quercetin (D&Q). Our p16INK4a induction and knockdown studies showed the
requirement of p16INK4a for expression of known SASP factors such as IL6, Ereg, Ccl8. Another aspect that has
been largely underexplored in the identity and dependence p16INK4 expression of SASP factors in vivo. For the
R00 phase of my proposed work, I will further explore how the expression of p16INK4 is able to reprogram the
SASP to support tissue repair, specifically epithelial regeneration. I will with our tools to functionally induce and
remove p16INK4 in fibroblasts and 1) asses epithelial growth, 2) transcriptome analysis, and 3) proteomics to
capture secreted proteins to identify p16INK4a-dependent SASP factors. I have extensive knowledge on working
with INKBRITE and the tools to manipulate p16 INK4a expression which will allow me to pursue the proposed
work with ease. With additional training from Drs. Peng and Sheppard I will expand my current knowledge of
lung biology and cellular senescence while establishing a new protocol of identifying secreted proteins in vivo
that will serve as a unique skillset for my transition to my own lab. These studies will lay foundation for our
understanding of diverse roles of SASP factors during homeostasis and injury."

N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA methylation in mammalian cells. Emerging evidence
has linked m6A with cancer phenotypes in many cancers, spurring a surge of research in studying m6A and
cancer biology. However, dysregulation of m6A effector writers, erasers, and readers and reprogramming of
m6A sites are poorly characterized. How different modes of m6A-regulation of gene expression mediate the
downstream cancer pathways and phenotypes is mostly missing. We have developed several widely used
informatics tools for m6A peak detection, differential m6A analysis, and functional predictions for m6A targets
from MeRIP-seq m6A profiling data. Using these tools, we worked together with cancer biology collaborators to
reveal reprogramed viral and host m6A epitranscriptome in cells infected by the oncogenic virus KSHV and
discovered a cross-talk between m6A writers, erasers, and readers to regulate cancer growth and progression.
However, the fast-moving m6A and cancer research poses many unmet informatics challenges. Among them,
the ability to accurately identify single-base m6A sites and predict key m6A regulatory mechanisms from
profiling data is seriously lacking. Also, a comprehensive database that catalogs and enables queries of where,
what, and how of m6A methylation and function in normal and cancer conditions is highly desirable. To address
challenges, we propose to develop m6A-Suite, an informatics toolbox, pipeline, and resources to facilitate the
mechanistic study of m6A in cancer. A key obstacle to developing tools in m6A-Suite is a lack of large, high-
quality training datasets. Toward this end, we have collected 1,113 human and 680 mouse MeRIP-seq
samples from cancer cell lines, tumors, and normal tissues and identified >4M m6A peaks. In parallel, we have
also collected 194,060 single-base m6A sites in 9 cell lines and 3 tissues. We propose to leverage this data to
construct the highly desirable training datasets. Using these datasets, we will develop efficient and accurate
tools for single-base m6A detection and quantification from MeRIP-seq and nanopore data (Aim 1), enable the
prediction of m6A-mediated RNA decay and splicing (Aim 2), and establish the comprehensive, queriable m6A-
KB knowledgbase to catalog these predictions in an extensive collection of public MeRIP-seq and nanopore
data in cancer and normal cells, and tissues in diverse conditions(Aim 3). We will systematically test and
evaluate these tools within this project and through many established and emerging collaborations inside and
outside the ITCR consortium. We will make the tools and data freely available to the research community and
constantly seek feedback from the collaborators and users for improvement. Given the emerging nature of
m6A and cancer research, the addition of these tools to the ITCR program will positively impact this important,
fast-growing, new area of cancer research."
11063768,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeks to address concerns about foodborne illness
outbreaks linked to irrigation from untreated surface water via a proposed revision to the Food
Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule. The rule change addresses the threat to
public health from the foodborne illness outbreaks that continue to occur with high frequency in
certain produce commodities. It is widely believed that the root cause of the outbreaks is the
proximity of animal feed lots to surface water used for irrigation, necessitating the sanitization of
the water to ensure delivery of pathogen-free water to crops. Growers, however, currently lack
viable mitigation tools to comply with the impending regulatory change. The primary solution today
is to use furrow irrigation to avoid contact between water and plant leaves and to prohibit
application of overhead irrigation 3 weeks prior to harvest. Current, but infrequently employed,
sanitization solutions include treating irrigation water with environmentally damaging chemicals
like chlorine or implementing cost prohibitive technological solutions. En Solución proposes a
cost-effective, easily implemented, chemical and residual-free irrigation water treatment system
that utilizes ozone nanobubbles to neutralize pathogens. Ozone, in both its gaseous and aqueous
phases, is generally recognized as safe by the FDA and has been shown to effectively reduce
microbial contamination in waste water; however, certain engineering and efficiency challenges
have prevented its use in high-volume, high-flow applications like irrigation water treatment.
Unlike traditional macro-sized bubbles from existing technologies, the nanobubbles produced by
En Solución’s technology have the remarkable ability to remain stable in high concentrations for
months at a time and allow for high gas infusion rates and retention times. As a result, more ozone
is kept in the solution, greatly enhancing the concentration of ozone able to be delivered
throughout an irrigation system. The technology developed by En Solución also has implications
on plant productivity and soil health, as hyper-oxygenated water (a byproduct of the decay of
ozone nanobubbles in the irrigation water) has been demonstrated to stimulate plant and root
growth. During the Phase II project, En Solución will develop a commercial-scale ozone
nanobubble irrigation unit that will easily integrate into existing field irrigation infrastructure to
provide continuous sanitization for surface water applied to field crops. The technology will be
fully validated via independent university study and demonstrated at full scale in a pilot
implementation at an operating farm."

Dental caries is a global infectious disease impacting the lives of 80% of the human population.
Severe early childhood caries (SECC) is of particular concern and characterized by extensive tooth
decay that can dramatically affect the dental health of children under six years of age. This
constitutes a significant economic burden, can have dramatic impact on the child’s well being and
may contribute to overall health later in life. Streptococcus mutans is the bacterium most commonly
associated with initiation of SECC and early childhood caries (ECC). Biosynthetic gene clusters
(BGCs) in bacteria often encode genes for small molecules and other antimicrobial peptides. This
research plan proposes to investigate a novel BGC (butyrolactone-ladderane hybrid, BL-BGC) of
S. mutans from a high caries risk population to identify its impact on S. mutans virulence and survival
traits. Preliminary data suggests the BL-BGC is significantly up regulated in dental caries and occurs
in the most prevalent strain type of S. mutans within a high-caries risk study population. The
hypothesis is that clinical S. mutans strains with the BL-BGC will have increased virulence properties
and cariogenicity. Aim 1 will characterize phenotypes of clinical S. mutans strains containing the BL-
BGC and their association with dental caries key virulence and survival traits using gene mutagenesis
and in-vivo biofilm analysis. Aim 2 will determine the impact of BL-BGC on expression of virulence
genes and metabolites in S. mutans biofilms using RNA-sequencing and metabolomics analysis. Aim
3 will determine the how BL-BGC impacts S. mutans colonization and virulence using animal models
of dental caries. The proposed study will elucidate the role of BL-BGC in S. mutans virulence and
fitness during the K99 phase. Metabolites produced by S. mutans with BL-BGC impacting key
virulence traits will be purified and characterized in the R00 phase, providing new insights into
S. mutans’ role in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Characterization of this and other BGCs may
lead to new therapeutic targets designed to reduce, reverse, or even prevent SECC. The K99 phase
of this award will provide the time and support for additional research training, building effective
collaborations, enhancing professional development and submission of publications leading to a
successful transition to an independent academic research appointment in the R00 phase. This study
is unique in the use of BGCs from clinical S. mutans isolates from a high-risk caries population
allowing for clinical translation of results and the use of metabolomics for identification of BL-BGC
related compounds/metabolites. This study will enable an independent career path by establishing a
multidisciplinary program utilizing molecular biology approaches to validate epidemiological
associations, bridging these fields and advancing the knowledge of S. mutans virulence in caries."
11065800,"Cervical Cancer remains one of the most common and morbid cancers among women living in sub-
Saharan Africa, and the incidence of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is nearly fivefold higher in women living with
HIV (WLWH) compared to women living without HIV infection. ICC also disproportionately impacts medically
marginalized women in the United States. ICC is a consequence of infection with a “high-risk” (hr) strain of human
papillomavirus (HPV). There is an ordered progression from a healthy cervix to a cervix that is asymptomatically
infected with hrHPV to low grade cervical dysplasia to high grade cervical dysplasia and eventually to ICC. The
biologic determinants of this ordered progression have not been entirely established. Of note, a small proportion
of women with cervical dysplasia will spontaneously regress their dysplastic lesions and sometimes clear hrHPV
infection, and this appears to occur less frequently among WLWH. Primary prevention includes vaccines against
HPV which are extremely effective, but nearly 4 in 5 women across the world have not been vaccinated against
HPV. In women infected with hrHPV, secondary prevention includes treatment of high-grade dysplastic lesions.
In resource limited settings, especially in areas with high levels of HIV, both screening for and eradication of
dysplastic lesions remains challenging. Screening programs are often overwhelmed and rely on screening tests
with limited accuracy and treatment regimens that have limited efficacy and some long-term morbidity.
 Our research team from has generated considerable preliminary data to understand the biologic
determinants of progression and regression of cervical dysplasia among Ugandan women with and without HIV
infection. This work has identified key biologic pathways that may be implicated in the regression of high-grade
cervical dysplasia (CIN2/3), including those related to toll-like receptor pathways. We propose to further
characterize the microenvironment of dysplastic cervical tissue and ICC in three cohorts, including of
WLWH from Uganda, as well a cancer disparity study of African American women from East Cleveland,
and to determine whether in an experimental model of HPV-associated cancer a vaginal application of
novel formulations of TLR 7/8 agonist activates specific pathways and whether these pathways are
associated with clinical regression of HPV-associated tumors. This work would both further the
understanding of the role of the innate immune system in the tumor microenvironment of patients with HIV-
associated malignancies and offer potential therapeutic strategies to a diverse group of patients with HIV and
cancer."

The proposal will study the unusual phenotype of a 69-year-old woman who displays exceptionally
accelerated skin wound healing with minimal scarring. Genome sequencing revealed that her
phenotype is caused by an ~8 kb deletion downstream of the fatty acid aldehyde hydrolase

The goal of this proposal is to understand how the FAAH OUT deletion results in accelerated
wound healing. In the United States, the annual medical burden of chronic wounds exceeds $25
billion and continues to rise with the aging population. There is a critical need to improve
understanding of the biological processes underlying skin wound healing and to innovate new
therapies. In the first aim, we will study normal and wounded skin tissue from the study subject
using spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization, and xenograft skin repair models to understand
how the FAAH OUT locus regulates wound healing. In the second aim, we will elucidate the FAAH
OUT genetic interactome to gain insight to its molecular mechanisms. By studying a rare genetic
allele of an individual with markedly enhanced wound healing, this proposal aims to generate
novel insight to the role of lncRNAs in wound repair and discover new human-validated targets to
treat cutaneous wounds."
11049230,"Project summary/Abstract
MSCs play critical roles in tissue turnover and injury healing processes, making them highly valuable in the
field of regenerative medicine. The murine teeth present an excellent model for investigating MSC
homeostasis due to the rapid turnover and regenerative abilities in incisors and the limited injury healing
capacity in molars that resembles human teeth. Understanding how MSCs homeostasis is regulated in
murine teeth will provide valuable insights for applying MSCs to regenerative dentistry. MSC homeostasis
involves the maintenance of stem cell niche, directed migration, re-entry into the cell cycle for proliferation,
and guided differentiation, etc. By employing a newly developed knockout mouse model, we found that a
predicted gene, Din (
4930453N24Rik
), plays pivotal roles in governing MSC homeostasis in murine teeth by
regulating Rho GTPases, RhoA and RAC1. The incisor growth in Din-KO mice arrested after eruption, and
the injury healing process was significantly impaired in both incisors and molars. A series of lineage-specific
knockouts revealed that Din is crucial for dental MSCs but dispensable for differentiated odontoblasts and
dental epithelium-derived cells. Din-KO MSCs showed diminished stemness, reduced motility and sign of
aging, along with compromised osteogenesis ability and enhanced adipogenesis potential. Transcriptomic,
proteomic and computational analyses identified DIN as a novel regulator of the binary molecular switches,
Rho GTPases. The interactions between DIN and GTPases likely occur through potential binding sites
within a highly conserved NTF2 domain in DIN and several critical function domains in GTPases, which
appear to further trigger downstream signaling, such as canonical WNT pathway. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that Din regulates MSC homeostasis in murine teeth during tissue turnover and injury
healing by interacting with Rho GTPases and their downstream signaling pathways, including the canonical
WNT signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims: 1) To determine Din role
and the cell fate of Din+ vs. Din- MSCs in different MSC subsets during tissue turnover and injury healing
processes, and 2) To determine how Din regulates Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1 and their downstream
effectors. Successful completion of the proposed study will advance our understanding of the regulatory
mechanism governing MSC homeostasis in murine teeth during tissue turnover and injury healing
processes. The discovery of a novel GTPases regulator and the elucidation of its associated mechanism
will have broad impact beyond the dental research field."

This project aims to generate a body of data that will result in improved approaches for disease
surveillance and prevention and expanded access to interventions for the reduction of morbidity and
mortality associated with influenza and other respiratory pathogens in South Africa and the African
region. Specifically (Objective 1, Project 1), we aim to expand and evaluate digital participatory
surveillance (DPS) in South Africa. If found to provide valid and useful data on trends in respiratory
illness and health-seeking behavior, we will expand this platform in collaboration with neighbouring
countries with limited laboratory infrastructure and evaluate it as a system for monitoring seasonal
respiratory illness and identifying outbreaks in the African region. We will also (Objective 1, Project 2)
evaluate right-sizing for influenza genomic surveillance through an evaluation of whether the timing,
geographic and demographic distribution of influenza genomic sequence data affects the reported
dominance and diversity of circulating viruses to guide annual influenza vaccine composition. This will
have a training component to increase regional capacity for next generation sequencing and will
provide data to guide WHO and CDC on the optimum number and geographic distribution of sentinel
sites needed to facilitate public health decisions. As part of our strategy to strengthen the NICD’s role
as a national and regional influenza reference laboratory we will develop and implement influenza
microneutralization (MN) assays (Objective 1, Project 3). These assays will be used to better
characterize immune responses to influenza infection or vaccination, demonstrate the role of sero-
epidemiology for public health surveillance and enable testing of sera collected in vaccine trials. We
will also develop a high throughput influenza multiplex immunoassays (MIA) to characterize the
immune response to influenza infection and vaccination (Objective 1, Project 4). Once successfully
optimized this assay will be used to conduct antibody landscape studies from cohort participants in
the CDC-funded HUTS and PHIRST studies and evaluate vaccine trial participant responses. In future
years, these antibody landscape analyses, combined with high-resolution cohort data (including
infection and vaccination histories) and whole genome sequencing data from participants, will
generate foundational knowledge on population-level immune response and how this drives viral
evolution. The ultimate goal of this work would be to develop a framework in which population
serology data is incorporated into the WHO vaccine strain update process. We will conduct a phase 2
double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the vaccine efficacy, safety, and
immunogenicity of a seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine and a comparator vaccine, in healthy
South Africans (Objective 2, Project 5). This study will aim to understand the mechanism by which
different influenza vaccines prevent illness and the potential impact of different vaccines on onward
transmission. Ultimately this would be part of a roadmap to ensure increased access to influenza
vaccines in Africa. Lastly (Objective 3, Project 6), we aim to scale up and maintain increased influenza
uptake among groups at increased risk of severe influenza illness by understanding the drivers of low
influenza vaccination uptake and challenges in current influenza vaccination campaigns, and
implementing strategies targeted at these drivers."
11052672,"Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a leading VCID with no treatments. While it is known that proper
cerebrovascular function is critical for brain health, our poor understanding of the cellular/molecular mechanisms
that promote the onset and progression of cognitive decline at the vascular unit (VU)/neuron interface limited
the identification of therapeutic targets. Inadequate inclusion of vascular risk factors, biological sex and long-
term stroke care practices into the recovery research prevented the development of comprehensive preventive
and therapeutic strategies for PSCI. The goal of this proposal is to address these gaps in knowledge by
advancing our understanding of the role of the endothelin (ET) system beyond its extensively studied contractile
effects to the regulation of the VU (endothelial cell-pericyte-astrocyte) integrity using preclinical models of
hypertension, PSCI and rehabilitation. Brain ET-1 levels correlate with the degree of hypoperfusion and the
severity of dementia. Yet, how and to what extent the ET system contributes to PSCI is not known. In contrast
to the detrimental effects of ETA receptor (ETAR) signaling, the encouraging results of a recently completed
Phase III trial showed that the stimulation of ETBR improves functional outcomes. We have evidence that
prevention of cognitive decline is associated with preserved VU integrity; integration of enriched care (EnCare)
with social/physical activities to our stroke care paradigm attenuates PSCI in male SHRs; this is associated with
the prevention of stroke-induced increases in the expression of VU ETAR, brain microvascular endothelial cells
(BMVECs), which were previously thought to have only ETBR, also possess ETAR, and ETAR signaling
promotes BMVEC and pericyte degeneration (senescence, endothelial mesenchymal transition-EndMT, and
transition of pericytes to a microglia-like phenotype). We hypothesize that dysregulation of microvascular
ETAR/ETBR balance contributes to profound progressive PSCI in hypertension by promoting degeneration of
the VU which disrupts vaso-neuronal coupling. A corollary to this hypothesis is that modulation of the ET
signaling via ETAR blockade or ETBR stimulation will improve the functional and structural integrity of the VU
and prevent PSCI. Aim 1 will determine the relationship of post-stroke changes in the ET system with the
development of PSCI. Mechanistic Aim 2 will determine endothelial yin-yang (ETAR-ETBR) mechanisms
contributing to the regulation of VU phenotypes and vasotrophic (un)coupling by defining the impact of
modulation of the ETAR or ETBR signaling on autocrine/paracrine regulation of senescence and phenotypes of
VU cells in and targeted eETAR silencing on VU integrity and PSCI. Translational Aim 3 will determine the most
effective approaches to stimulate protective ETR signaling by defining the impact of intranasal or systemic
administration of ETAR antagonist BQ123 or ETBR agonist IRL-1620 alone and in combination with EnCare on
the development and progression of cognitive and psychological deficits and fluid/imaging biomarkers in PSCI."

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) cause a significant portion of childhood croup, bronchiolitis and
pneumonia in the U.S. and worldwide, yet no effective drugs or vaccines are available. For the lethal Nipah
(NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, in the face of human-to-human transmission of NiV, there is risk for global
spread as well as accidental or deliberate exposure. Despite the existence of antibody preparations for passive
immunoprophylaxis, there is no feasible approach to prevent or treat the human disease. These viruses serve
as prototypes for emerging paramyxoviruses. With this application we build on recent breakthroughs that have
led to a new broad-spectrum antiviral strategy based on inhibiting fusion during viral entry. We combine
structure-based optimization of fusion inhibitory lipopeptides, backbone modification via partial replacement of
α-amino acid residues with unnatural β-amino acid residues to enhance half-life, and addition of lipid
components to enhance antiviral efficacy. Using virologic, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments we will develop
powerful novel HPIV3/NiV/HeV fusion inhibitors that can be administered by inhalation. Validation of our
strategies with circulating respiratory viruses and clinical NiV virus strains in vitro and in vivo will lead us to
antiviral agents that are effective and practical in the clinical setting.
Aim 1. Targeting the paramyxovirus fusion complex: Evaluate entry inhibitor approaches in vitro.
We will develop fusion-inhibitory lipopeptides, combining conventional peptide design with backbone-
modification and membrane targeting to optimize broad fusion inhibition activity for NiV, HeV, HPIV, and
optimize potency, protease resistance, and tissue targeting of lead lipopeptides. We will evaluate antiviral
activity and potential for antiviral resistance in authentic ex vivo models. Human airway and brain models will
be employed to elicit resistant viruses in ex vivo evolution experiments, to study the molecular bases for
antiviral activity and potential for resistance to lead peptides.
Aim 2. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy of formulated lead antivirals in vivo.
We will assess the biodistribution and immunogenicity, acute toxicity, and PK/PD via nasal or inhalation
delivery of lead candidate series in small animal models, and evaluate efficacy of lead peptides for NiV/HeV in
golden hamsters and for HPIV in cotton rats. An efficacy study for the NiV lead will be conducted in African
green monkeys.
We propose that peptide backbone modification and membrane targeting strategies will generate broad anti-
paramyxovirus agents that can be delivered via inhalation with unprecedented efficacy and pharmacokinetic
properties."
11061628,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The preteen years are a critical period in which to study the development of suicidal thoughts and behavior
(STB). During this period, youth experience changes in emotion regulation and develop cognitive capacities
that include an emerging understanding of the permanence of death, which in turn affect the expression of
STB. However, as noted in the 2021 NIMH- Sponsored Research Round Table Series: Risk, Resilience, and
Trajectories in Preteen Suicide, research on preteen STB has been hindered by the field’s failure to focus on
an accurate, and thorough, assessment of STB in this age group. This application seeks to develop and test a
comprehensive approach to the assessment of preteen STB that includes child and parent/guardian self-
report, clinician interviews, an implicit association test, a death understanding interview, and observational
measures. In order to address this question, this application will examine both concurrent and predictive
validity of the assessment approach in preteens receiving intensive psychiatric services (inpatient or partial
hospitalization) who have a range of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, as well as a range of STB. We
will recruit 360 preteens at Bradley Hospital/Brown Medical School and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,
ensuring a diverse sample of children. In addition to refining the assessment of preteen STB, we will also: 1)
conduct a thorough clinical assessment of related symptomatology to better inform clinical practice, and 2)
examine mechanisms hypothesized to underlie preteen STB, using an RDoC-informed approach. We will also
examine which co- occurring symptoms and mechanisms significantly improve predictive validity for adverse
clinical STB outcomes above that of the STB assessment alone. This assessment approach is innovative in
that it is the first study to develop a multi-modal, multi-informant assessment approach for preteen STB
including use of real-time observational strategies, as well as an implicit association test. This is significant
because we are studying the most high-risk population of preteens with STB and we will be able to delineate
mechanisms related to preteen STB. This work addresses: NIMH Strategic Objective 2.1.B “Characterize the
emergence and progression of mental illnesses”, 2.2.A “Determining early risk and protective factors and
related mechanisms”, and 2.2.B“Developing reliable and robust biomarkers and assessment tools to predict
illness onset, and course, across diverse populations”."

The goal of this supplement is to investigate the cellular composition and regulatory mechanisms within the
entorhinal cortex (EC) that vary with age and sex, with a focus on their potential implications for differential
Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. The EC is the gateway between the hippocampus and neocortex, and is
therefore a crucial structure for the formation and retrieval of memories. The EC is particularly involved in spatial
memory, navigation and the perception of time, and is among the first brain regions affected by Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD). This proposal seeks to analyze single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data from 135 macaque entorhinal
cortices, encompassing the natural lifespan of free-living macaques and consisting of 77 females, to identify
variations in cellular composition and gene expression associated with age and sex.
The research plan for this project uses snRNA-seq data, facilitating the investigation of heterogeneity of cell
types and transcriptional states across ages and sexes. The project will generate a comprehensive analysis of
which cell types and gene regulatory networks are most strongly impacted by these demographic factors. This
information will be leveraged to enhance our understanding of the cellular and molecular etiology of AD, with a
particular focus on why females are disproportionately affected.
This proposal also focuses on the scientific training and career development of Kelsi Watkins during her graduate
studies. Kesi will receive training in computational, statistical, and theoretical analysis of large-scale snRNA-seq
data. She will also gain experience and mentorship in public speaking, scientific and professional writing, and
project management, with mentorship provided by experts in bioinformatics and statistical approaches to single-
cell genomics data analysis, who have successfully trained predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers. This
training and development will prepare Kelsi for a successful career as an independent researcher in
neurogenomics and the biology of aging.
The insights gained from this research have the potential to shed light on the disproportionate impact of AD on
females and provide crucial data for addressing the increasing prevalence of the disease in an aging global
population. By elucidating the influence of demographic factors on AD etiology and equipping the next generation
of researchers with essential skills, this project contributes significantly to addressing the pressing challenges
posed by AD in an aging global population."

Family health history (FHH) is a critical component of genomic medicine to identify patients at risk for
hereditary conditions and to contextualize genetic testing results. Despite evidence of its clinical
importance, FHH is broadly underutilized and underappreciated in clinical care. Likewise, patients’
perceptions of the importance of FHH may be unclear and therefore, the sharing FHH on patient
intake forms is overlooked, resulting in incomplete information shared with the provider. Several
other factors may contribute to patients’ lack of completion of FHH intake forms and sharing of FHH
information with their provider including cultural factors that impact sharing of health information
among family members for some conditions, gender and age differences regarding knowledge of
FHH and sharing, literacy, and limited knowledge due to blended or non-traditional family structures.
For example, older individuals and women tend to have greater knowledge of family members’ health
status. The overall goal of the parent award is to create a flexible and scalable infrastructure for
implementing an end-to- end genomic medicine risk assessment and risk management solution that
can be disseminated to a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations. Specifically, the
project aims to define and deploy a new care delivery model known as “Genomic medicine Risk
Assessment Care for Everyone” (GRACE). The central hypothesis is that combining a FHH-driven
risk assessment program, a literacy-enhanced interface, family-oriented social networking, and a
genetic testing delivery system, will create an end-to-end risk assessment/risk management solution
that will both engage and increase the proportion of diverse patients who are identified as at
increased risk, who undergo testing, and, when appropriate, who initiate cascade screening among
relatives. The FHH software tool, MeTree, will be used as the risk assessment tool in this
demonstration project; MeTree generates reports for patients and providers. For this supplement
application, we will specifically explore cultural, family, and lifestyle factors that may impact
patients’ ability to provide complete FHH information through the MeTree tool through a
literature review and semi-structured interviews with patients enrolled in the GRACE study.
Specifically, we aim to focus on patient demographics such as race/ethnicity, culture, and
LGBTQ+ communities to better define patient barriers and contribute to the improved FHH
data collection as part of the GRACE delivery model."

Single allelic defects in BM-associated genes COL 17 A 1, LAMA3, and LAMB3 cause autosomal dominant
amelogenesis imperfecta in humans. They are strongly expressed in secretory ameloblasts, and localize along
the enamel mineralization front, where no BM structure is observed. These findings lead to the hypothesis that
the proteins of the basement membrane attachment complex are critical components of the ameloblastspecific
mineral ribbon attachment/elongation complex that extends and orients enamel ribbons at the
mineralization front during the secretory stage of amelogenesis.
Three specific aims (SA) are proposed. SA1: Identify the critical components of the ameloblast-specific mineral
ribbon attachment/elongation complex in wild-type 0,/VT) mice. Potential components of this complex have been
localized at the Tomes' process during the K99 phase. The localization of BM-associated components at the
electron microscopy level will be defined, and protein interactions among them will be further explored during
the R00 phase. SA2: Determine the function of LAMA3 during enamel formation by conditionally knocking out
Lama3 expression in ameloblasts. The Amelx-iCre;Lama3nm mice have been validate and show hypoplastic
enamel. I will further examine the molecular changes and use focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy
to characterize the ultrastructural changes in enamel formation in Amelx-iCre;Lama3fltfl mice. SA3: Generate a
Co/17a1 conditional knockout mouse model and determine the function of type XVII collagen in enamel formation.
A Co/17a1fl mouse has been generated and validated at multiple levels. Preliminary results showed that the
enamel phenotype of Amelx-iCre;Co/17a1fl1fl mice was comparable to those of the WT. I will complete the
characterizations of the Amelx-iCre;Co/17a1fl1fl mice. In addition, I will investigate the roles of Co/17a1 in
presecretory ameloblasts in Krt14-Cre-ERr2;Co/17a1fltfl mice. I will induce the epithelium-specific removal of
Co/17a1 in the Krt14-Cre-ERr2;Co/17a1fltfl mice and harvest the incisors later for molecular and ultrastructural
characterizations. The completion of this proposal will advance our understanding of enamel formation, shed
light on the treatment options of amelogenesis imperfecta, and provide insights for enamel biomimetics. The
Co/17a1fl mouse will also become a critical tool for studies of type XVII collagen in other organs and tissues.
My career goal is to study the regulations of biomineralization, particularly in enamel and dentin formation. During
the K99 phase, I have completed a series of scientific training and career development activities. I will transition
to a tenure-track assistant professor in the R00 phase. I will establish a robust independent laboratory and
continue my investigations in the field of tooth development and biomineralization."

The overall dental morphology of an adult vertebrate is set in motion by the initiation of tooth fields at
specific regions in the body plan during early development. Thereafter, primary teeth form sequentially,
expanding each tooth field as new teeth are added at the tooth field margin. Basic research into the genes
and signaling pathways underlying these processes will reveal which cell types and genetic signatures are
associated with tooth field initiation and expansion, thus informing future attempts to create and
successfully implant live teeth. By determining which cell types are capable of undergoing transformation
to a dental fate, new avenues for the creation of lab-made tooth organs will be revealed. Additionally,
identifying the genetic signatures associated with tooth field expansion and arrest will provide information
about the greater context under which dental arcade expansion is facilitated. The present study will use a
newly developed set of stable transgenic stickleback fish and zebrafish to identify the cell types, transcript
profiles, and signaling events that underlie the processes of tooth field initiation, expansion, and arrest.
These model fishes present a unique opportunity to understand tooth field morphogenesis, because tooth
field position and size can be manipulated using genetic tools. In response to Eda overexpression, both
species form ectopic tooth fields in highly consistent locations in or on the head, while also expanding
endogenous tooth fields. By contrast, Dkk2 overexpression in stickleback reduces tooth field size by
inhibiting tooth field expansion. Aim 1 seeks to understand the gene expression dynamics of the switch to
a tooth organ fate by assessing the fine spatial expression patterns of genes encoding Tumor Necrosis
Factor Receptors (TNFRs), candidate receptors that may confer the response to Eda, and performing
single-cell RNA sequencing on tooth-competent regions microdissected from Eda overexpressing and WT
sticklebacks. Aim 2 of this project seeks to find gene expression differences associated with regenerative
vs non-regenerative teeth. Aim 3 will elucidate which developmental pathways are associated with tooth
field size and tooth row number by comparing the gene expression profiles of the dissected tooth field
margins derived from expanded (Eda overexpression), arrested (Dkk2 overexpression), and normal
stickleback tooth fields. Overall, these experiments will yield information on how teeth can be specified

Macrophages contribute to ozone toxicity by regulating both the initiation and resolution of lung 
inflammation; these processes are mediated by distinct macrophage subpopulations broadly classified as 
proinflammatory/cytotoxic (M1) and anti-inflammatory/wound repair (M2) macrophages. M1 and M2 
macrophage activation is controlled, in part, by intracellular metabolism; thus, while high glycolytic capacity 
is associated with M1 activity, increases in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation 
are required for M2 macrophage activation. New data suggest that ozone toxicity is due to impaired M2 
activation and a failure to resolve inflammation, however, mechanisms are not known. A preliminary RNAseq analysis of lung macrophages collected after ozone exposure revealed significant enrichment of the 
estrogen receptor signaling pathway among differentially expressed genes. This was associated with an 
increase in glycolytic metabolism and down-regulation of PPARγ expression, a transcription factor known 
to promote M2 phenotype and resolution of inflammation by shifting intracellular metabolism to fatty acid 
oxidation. Estrogen has been shown to regulate PPARγ expression by activating estrogen receptor alpha 
(ESR1) located at the cell membrane, and to promote macrophage anti-inflammatory activity by shifting 
metabolism to fatty acid oxidation; we speculate that this pathway is important in macrophage responses to 
ozone. We hypothesize that ozone interferes with extra-nuclear ESR1 signaling in macrophages and 
downstream activation of PPARγ; this leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation and M2 macrophage 
activation resulting in aberrant resolution of inflammation and increased tissue injury. Two aims are 
proposed to test this hypothesis. In the first aim, I will analyze the role for ESR1 signaling in macrophage 
immunometabolism and phenotypic activation. Aim 2 will focus on 1) elucidation of mechanisms by which 
ozone interferes with extra-nuclear ESR1 signaling, 2) the role of extra-nuclear ESR1 in macrophage 
bioenergetics and phenotype in response to ozone and how this influences lung injury, and 3) developing 
strategies to mitigate ozone-induced lung injury by rescuing extra-nuclear ESR1 signaling. Results of these 
studies will provide novel data on general mechanisms underlying macrophage responses to inhaled ozone 
and mechanistic evidence supporting sex-based differences in pulmonary responses. Findings that ESR1 
is critical in these pathways will highlight estrogen signaling as a key driver of sexual dimorphism in lung 
disease and indicate that individualized exposure limits and therapeutic strategies may be required to 
prevent disease and to target distinct pathways driving toxicity in men and women. I will leverage my 
training in macrophage biology, ESR1 signaling, bioinformatics, and intracellular metabolism acquired 
during the K99 award period to develop an independent research program at my new institution focused on 
elucidating estrogen receptor signaling networks regulating inflammation in environmentally induced lung 
disease."
10936615,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Excess reactive oxygen species, or oxidative stress, is a ubiquitous condition humans experience that damages
the entire cell. Importantly, oxidative stress damages DNA resulting in numerous lesions that can halt DNA
replication and increase mutagenesis. Oxidative stress emanates from various endogenous sources (metabolism,
inflammation, etc.) but also exogenous environmental sources such as pollution, smoking, and ultraviolet radiation
(UVR), arguably the most universal source of oxidative stress and DNA damage humans encounter. 8-oxodeoxyguaine
(8oxoG) is a principle adduct generated by oxidative stress, and while well studied in vitro, is
historically difficult to investigate in cells since the agents used to produce it (UVA, hydrogen peroxide, etc.) also
generate other DNA lesions, and damage lipids and proteins in the cell. Our group developed and published on a
novel fluorogen activated peptide (FAP) which can bind malachite green photosensitizer dyes and when excited
with far-red light, specifically produces singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is known to have a short half-life and reacts
rapidly with guanine to form 8oxoG. By fusing FAP to the telomere binding protein TRF1, we demonstrated the
specificity of our chemoptogenetic system, and its spatial and temporal control. We also generated cells which
express FAP fused to the histone H2B (H2B-FAP), allowing for genome-wide production of 8oxoG. The overall
hypothesis of this proposal is that 8oxoG stalls DNA replication forks, especially at repetitive DNA sequences like
telomeres, requiring the activities of ATR, Pol IJ, and PrimPol. This proposal is uniquely poised to address this
hypothesis, as the H2B-FAP and TRF1-FAP tools are the only methods available to specifically induce 8oxoG
within the human genome. In addition to telomeres, use of H2B-FAP will allow for the identification of other
sequences sensitive to 8oxoG formation by examining the binding of replication stress response factors. Using
physiological conditions, these identified sequences as well as telomere repeats will be studied in vitro to
determine if they stall replicative DNA polymerases. This combination of biochemical and cellular replication
studies will fill a critical gap in our knowledge of how 8oxoG impacts replication fork integrity and cell
fate. Oxidative stress is linked to various diseases including cancer, but also aging. However, due to its pleiotropic
effects, it is difficult to attribute any specific outcome to a particular lesion. While this study will advance our general
understanding of 8oxoG, it will directly compare H2B-FAP activation with UVR, which induces pyrimidine dimers
in addition to oxidative stress. UVR promotes skin carcinogenesis especially in the absence of factors like Pol 11,
the protein mutated in the cancer predisposition syndrome, XPV. This study will examine the direct role of Pol 11
and other DNA replication factors (ATR, PrimPol, FANCD2, and MacroH2A1 .2) in the cellular response to 8oxoG."

Among the 5.5 million older people (>50 years) with HIV (OPWH), 80% live in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC). Ukraine, an emblematic LMIC in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), is the only world region with
increasing HIV incidence and mortality. Among the 240,000 PWH in Ukraine, OPWH account for 15% of people
with newly diagnosed HIV annually but OPWH are significantly less likely to initiate ART and be retained in care,
compared to younger people with HIV. Consequently, mortality among OPWH is significantly higher than the
age-matched general population. Key barriers to ART engagement for OPWH include stigma, social isolation
and multimorbidity including depression. Our previous work demonstrates that OPWH in Ukraine crave giving
and receiving peer support, are interested in mHealth options to increase social engagement and belonging
within a community, and have capacity for smartphone use. PositiveLinks is an established mHealth platform
demonstrated to effectively improve virologic outcomes in people living with HIV in the United States and in
Russia, another higher-income country where it has been successfully piloted. This app delivers appointment
reminders, daily queries (“check-ins”) of mood, stress and medication adherence, tailored educational resources,
and the opportunity to interact with other users on a secure, anonymous community message board (CMB). We
propose to adapt PositiveLinks for use in OPWH, for the Ukrainian LMIC context, and to incorporate into the
mHealth platform a culturally appropriate depression screening with subsequent brief intervention and referral
(SBIRT) to clinical evaluation.
In the R21 phase, we will perform focus groups discussions with OPWH and key informant interviews with
clinicians and clinic administrators to identify components to retain in the adaptation that are important for OPWH
to meaningfully engage in HIV care. We will perform alpha and beta testing of PositiveLinks Ukraine to evaluate
usability and functionality by OPWH to ensure that the R21 deliverable is a tailored, fully interactive app
supported by local stakeholders. In the R33 phase, we will perform an individually randomized controlled trial
among 240 OPWH, who are newly diagnosed or on ART without viral suppression, randomized 1:1 to the
PositiveLinks Ukraine intervention versus treatment as usual, to evaluate a) feasibility using a validated
framework, b) multilevel acceptability (OPWH, clinicians, clinic administrators, and policy makers), and c) efficacy
examining viral load suppression at 12 months and secondarily ART initiation, retention at 12 months, VL
suppression at 6 months, and time to ART initiation. These findings will provide key data necessary to design
and conduct further mHealth implementation research within HIV care in Ukraine. Through this work, we will also
stimulate capacity in mHealth through the development of a Consortium for mHealth Innovation and Intervention."

grained structures such as the fibroglandular tissue and vessels, brought about by events including, but not
limited to angiogenesis, and treatments such as radiation therapy. Changes in breast structural topology has
the potential to influence cancer risk, prognosis, and treatment response; however, this has not been
extensively studied nor quantified. Existing work is limited only to analysis of features such as radiomics.
 This project, undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team comprising topologists, computer scientists, imaging
informatics experts, and clinicians, aims to develop advanced methods for topological modeling and
reasoning with the primary hypothesis that these algorithms can ascertain weakening of tissue architecture
on imaging. This can help in identifying high-risk cases that are prone to cancer manifestation and cancer
recurrence. Specifically, the project proposes to develop TopoQuant, a suite of Topology Data Analysis
(TDA)-driven techniques for extracting and interpreting fine-grained topological information from breast
parenchyma, based on both 2D and 3D breast imaging. TopoQuant will generate high-quality annotations of
breast tissue, produce advanced topological descriptors to characterize breast tissue complex, learn
topology-informed prediction models using these topological features, as well as provide clinically intuitive
visualization of relevant topological features.
 The proposed work will advance both TDA and cancer research by create new TDA methodologies to
extract and analyze rich structural information from breast imaging. This will be achieved through: (1)
Developing novel topological algorithms to effectively capture the structural diversity in breast parenchyma;
(2) Addressing the challenge of limited data availability by devising 2D to 3D mapping methodologies that
yield highly actionable topological information even when the available data is sparse or restricted; (3)
Developing algorithms to co-harness the powerful learning ability of ‘black-box’ deep networks with
biologically-grounded ‘glass-box’ topological descriptors; and (4) Constructing interpretable TDA frameworks
specifically tailored for assessing cancer risk and radiation treatment response in breast tissue. Our
algorithms will reveal topological insights from breast tissue structures, enabling clinicians and researchers
to better comprehend, plan, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in breast cancer patients.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The research will enhance our understanding of breast cancer, potentially improving early detection and
treatment, thereby benefiting women’s health and quality of life. The novel methods for analyzing radiology
scans will have significant implications across multiple disciplines, including neuroscience and biology, and
promote cross-disciplinary collaboration. Algorithms developed will be shared with the scientific community,
and integrated into different platforms."
11062808,"This proposal aims to develop high-performing, fair, and interpretable large language models (LLMs) to
detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its precursor stages. In doing so, its overarching goal is to advance
healthcare through the innovative and responsible use of LLMs to recognize AD, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), and preclinical AD from transcribed unstructured speech samples, prioritizing equity
 and fairness in their deployment. Evidence has demonstrated that language is impaired early in AD,
including in the MCI and even prodromal AD stage. Moreover, recent natural language processing (NLP)
approaches have shown that informative markers of this impairment can be captured from spontaneous
speech samples. LLMs, a new cornerstone of NLP, have shown promise at addressing healthcare tasks,
 but concerns exist regarding their potential biases and poor explainability. We will test the use of LLMs to
identify early stages of the AD trajectory from transcribed unstructured speech samples, making equity,
fairness, and explainability a central piece of our aims. We hypothesize that the use of fair, explainable
 LLMs for early AD detection may overcome data constraints and interpretability issues common while
 enabling effective low-resource learning for this purpose. We will test this hypothesis through three aims:
 (1) building on our shared expertise and prior work, we will design LLM-based models for detecting MCI
 and dementia and explore their use in detecting the earliest preclinical stage; (2) we will enhance model
 fairness and interpretability through innovative demonstration example selection and domain-aligned
 instruction tuning techniques, and develop new methods for explaining LLM output in healthcare settings;
and (3) we will validate our methods by assessing their alignment with clinical parameters related to AD
and MCI. We will also perform a pioneering exploration of the extent to which our findings are repeatable
 beyond English settings. Expected outcomes include groundbreaking generalizable insights in NLP and
 AI fairness and interpretability, and domain-specific advances that could help ensure equitable access to
 AD and MCI detection. This may lay groundwork for a low-cost, scalable, non-invasive alternative for
cognitive health screening and reduce healthcare disparities via more equitable access to high-quality
cognitive health assessment. At an economic scale, this work may reduce long-term burden on the
 healthcare system and improve quality of life, benefitting individuals and society.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 It is critical to mark the earliest changes in brain function among those on the Alzheimer's disease (AD)
 trajectory, and subtle language changes may be a sensitive, non-invasive screening tool. We will harness
 fair, responsible, interpretable AI to analyze natural speech patterns as a marker of early AD. This will
 advance understanding of language changes in early AD and lay groundwork for equitable access to AD
 assessment, potentially reducing healthcare disparities and alleviating burden on the healthcare system."
11062823,"Under-treatment of mental health problems remains a major issue in the US, especially for youth, people
of color, and individuals with low incomes. Technology may help reduce disparities in and expand the
reach of mental health services. However, the newest technologies, such as generative AI, remain fraught
with perils such as hallucinations. Therefore, rather than using AI to directly interact with clients, we will
harness generative AI to provide training to mental health support providers, with the ultimate goal of
increasing accessibility of mental health services and improving mental health outcomes for those
receiving care. The goal of this research project is to develop and evaluate an automated, scalable
system for delivering experiential training to mental healthcare providers. Specifically, we propose to
develop a multi-agent training environment to provide interactive and experiential training on the micro-
skills and underlying common factors for both lay counselors and paraprofessionals. Our training
environment consists of three components: Virtual Patient, Assessor Agents, and Trainer Agents. Our
proposal has four aims. During Aim 1, we will develop and evaluate a set of LLM-based Virtual Patients
(VPs) that (a) realistically depict a wide range of common clinical problems (e.g., depression, job-related
stress, ADHD, and suicidality), (b) engage in coherent conversations with trainees, and (c) present typical
counseling challenges, such as addressing resistance to sharing problems in depth. During Aim 2, we will
develop an Assessor Agent capable of automatically assessing the micro-skills used by the trainee, as
well as how the trainee accomplishes higher-level segment goals (common factors). During Aim 3, we will
develop a Trainer Agent capable of interacting with trainees, the Assessor Agent module, and the Virtual
Patient module to achieve optimal training goals. During Aim 4, we will recruit 7Cups supporters to use
our multi-agent training environment to evaluate its impacts on the training outcomes."
11064449,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is increasing evidence that early intervention for psychosis in coordinated specialty care (CSC) services
improves outcomes and lives. The outcome of early course psychosis (EP) is heterogeneous, ranging from early
full recovery to treatment resistance and functional decline from the onset of illness. This heterogeneity limits
our ability to predict individual level outcomes needed for treatment planning and for tailoring the type, duration
and intensity of therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers as well as clinical and demographic features, early in the
illness can predict outcome, but taken individually, their prognostic value is limited. Our Bipolar- Schizophrenia
Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) consortium has recently developed, replicated and validated a
biomarker (EEG, eye movement testing, and neurocognition) based categorization (Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) in a
trans-diagnostic sample of cases with idiopathic psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar
disorder with psychosis), ranging from 18-35 years of age. In this study, we will leverage this categorization,
along with clinical and biomarker data to predict illness trajectory and outcome during follow-up at 1, 6 and 12
months in 320 EP patients across CSC clinics at the five B-SNIP sites. First, we will characterize outcome
trajectories and Biotype structure in EP. Our available data indicate the Biotype structure will be the same in EP
as in our large sample. Second, we will investigate the predictive value of the nine bio-factors and the three
Biotypes identified by B-SNIP for symptomatic and functional outcome. We predict that the EP population will
manifest distinct outcome clinical trajectories (good, intermediate and poor) and will have a Biotype structure
similar to that seen in chronic psychosis subjects, i.e., Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) (hypothesis 1). Biotype-3, and
Biotye-2 cases, will have the best outcomes (defined both categorically, and dimensionally, using symptomatic,
cognitive and functional measures); Biotype-1 will have the worst outcomes to CSC treatment, across all target
time points (hypothesis 2). Notably, Biotype-1 and Biotype-2 cases will have the same level of cognition function
at baseline. Finally, we will investigate the predictive value of clinical (such as diagnosis, illness duration,
substance abuse, and treatment adherence), and biomarker (including neuroimaging) features in a multi-variate
model and will develop a feasible biomarker battery and predictive algorithm for application in community CSC
sites nation-wide. We will thus provide to the field a means for predicting success of EP cases in CSC treatment
to improve clinical practice and to enhance efficient use of available treatment resources."

Advances in biomedical and behavioral data science and machine learning have the potential to promote health
equity by aiding in our understanding of the etiology of health disparities. In recognition of the need to foster
diversity, improve the quality of biomedical research, and enhance global competitiveness of the U.S. biomedical
research workforce, the The Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) U54 Center for Translational Research in
Health Disparities (CTRHD) is investing heavily in biomedical data science and data infrastructure around
genomics/multi-omics capacity to support translational projects and enhance informatics education and training
opportunities. In this project, we propose a continued collaboration between the Morehouse School of Medicine
(MSM-RCMI) and Florida International University’s RCMI (FIU-RCMI) center to: (Aim 1) Refine an existing
project-based data science curriculum (Software Carpentry) to include new staple R tools and principles and
create new modules for data ethics, data security, and a “Fundamentals for Success” remote synchronous track
for learners with lower computer literacy; (Aim 2) Develop a “Train the Trainer” program and train a cohort of
data science instructors from MSM and other RCMI partner institutions as well as organize a virtual workshop
series for newly trained instructors to teach data science basics and Evaluate learner and instructor progress
and experience week over week; (Aim 3) Expand existing partnerships within the RCMI- Coordinating Center
and Atlanta University Center Data Science Initiative to disseminate our curriculum and resources related to data
science and health disparities via the online Interdisciplinary Health Disparities and Data Science Training
collaboratory with remote asynchronous instructional support provided by data science instructors and mentors.
The MSM-RCMI and FIU-RCMI have a history of successful collaboration, including our Interdisciplinary Health
disparities and data Science trAiNing (IHSAN) program: we trained a pilot cohort of instructors from RCMI
centers to teach basic data science using the R programming language. Our program boasts great diversity
among our learners (57% female, 33% Black/AA, 29% Hispanic/Latinx) and our trainers (83% female, 25%
Black/AA, 33% Hispanic/Latinx). Further, the training we offered shows greater learner confidence week over
week with data science in the R programming language applied to health disparities, and the mentored
instructors reported greater teaching self-efficacy and confidence after this program. Based on the undeniable
success of our pilot training program, we propose to upskill RCMI investigators in data science techniques using
R for reproducible data analysis in health disparities research."
11065080,"This project examines dominant mutations in tRNA synthetase genes that cause inherited peripheral neuropathy. We seek to understand the biochemical and cellular basis for these diseases, to test mechanisms that could explain their specificity for motor and sensory neurons, and to test possible pharmacological and gene therapy-based treatments. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited diseases of the peripheral nervous system, and close to 100 genes are associated with CMT. The largest gene family associated with CMT is the tRNA synthetases. These enzymes charge amino acids onto their cognate tRNAs, and mutations in at least six cause peripheral neuropathy. Our preliminary data show that mutations in glycyl- and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (Gars and Yars, respectively) in mouse models lead to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) through the kinase GCN2. Genetic deletion of Gcn2 alleviates the phenotype of Gars/CMT2D mouse models. GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNAs and also stalled ribosomes, and genetic interaction studies are consistent with ribosome stalling in vivo. Furthermore, uncharged tRNAs should be rescued by overexpression of wild-type synthetase, and we have shown this does not happen in Gars mouse models. Instead we favor a mechanism in which the tRNA substrate becomes limiting. We propose the following model: The mutant synthetases have aberrantly increased affinity for their cognate tRNAs, effectively sequestering them. This leads to ribosome stalling at the relevant codons during translation, which activates GCN2 and the ISR. The chronic activation of the ISR contributes to disease. We propose three aims to test this model. In Aim 1, we will directly measure the affinities of wild-type and mutant synthetases for their cognate tRNAs, anticipating that mutant synthetases will have higher affinities and slower off rates. We will also develop cell-based models using pluripotent human cell lines engineered to carry neuropathy-associated tRNA synthetase alleles. Differentiating these cells to motor neurons will validate our model in human cells and enable studies ribosome stalling and other relevant cell biology. We can also combine these systems predictively to create pathogenic or protective mutations, correlating tRNA affinity, ribosome stalling, induction of the ISR, and severity of neuropathy. In Aim 2, we will test possible mechanisms underlying the specificity of the disease. The tRNA synthetase genes are ubiquitously expressed, and the change in affinity should not be cell-type specific. Therefore, motor and sensory neurons may be particularly susceptible to ribosome stalling and the induction of the ISR, or may be particularly sensitive to tRNA sequestration due to high expression of the synthetase genes or poor expression of tRNAs. In Aim 3, we will test whether pharmacological inhibition of the ISR is beneficial, as suggested by our genetic studies with Gcn2 knockout mice. We will also test if the phenotype is rescued (which we anticipate) or exacerbated using AAV9 vectors to increase tRNA expression. These studies are potentially translational, and also directly test our proposed tRNA sequestration mechanism."
11059402,"The US is currently grappling with an escalating drug overdose crisis, with overdose deaths soaring to a record high of 110,000 in 2022 alone. This crisis has particularly devastating effects on African American, American Indian/Alaska Native and other racial/ethnic minority populations. Harm reduction strategies, such as naloxone distribution, are pivotal components of the US Department of Health & Human Services Overdose Prevention Strategy. While many jurisdictions across the country are actively expanding the availability of evidence-based harm reduction programs, the complexity of the overdose crisis necessitates a multifaceted and localized
approach that goes beyond individual interventions. The availability of over $50 billion in legal opioid settlements nationwide, alongside innovative harm reduction interventions, such as overdose prevention centers, drug checking programs, and overdose detection technologies, presents unprecedented opportunities to address the overdose crisis and its harms comprehensively. Our project aims to design tailored harm reduction strategies that effectively address the heterogeneous nature of overdose epidemics, demographics, and local infrastructures across six distinct jurisdictions. Building on our previous work optimizing naloxone distribution strategies in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York City, we will collaborate closely with health departments and community partners to assess the effectiveness, cost-
effectiveness, and health equity outcomes of different harm reduction strategies in these and three new jurisdictions (Minnesota, Missouri, and Nevada). Through adapting a mathematical model and developing locally tailored decision tools, we will identify portfolios of harm reduction strategies that minimize fatal overdoses, maximize health equity, and provide value for money.
Central to our approach is stakeholder engagement and the implementation of evidence-based interventions tailored to local contexts. By engaging relevant stakeholders in the adaptation and customization of our model and decision tools, we seek to ensure their integration into decision-making processes and their sustainability beyond the duration of our project. Furthermore, guided by implementation science, we will assess the fit and scalability of the model and decision tools in supporting data- and equity-informed policy decisions. This project will create urgently needed, publicly available evidence and resources that can guide the allocation of opioid settlement funds and inform the adoption of sustainable and scalable harm reduction strategies.

11059365,"Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a common cause of human liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis, steatosis,
fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV chronically infects more than 250 million people
worldwide, including 1.25 million in the United States. Although HBV vaccine has greatly contributed to the
reduction of new cases of HBV infection and HCC, it does not offer therapeutic benefits to the hundreds of
millions of chronic HBV carriers. The World Health Organization has called for the elimination of viral hepatitis as
a public health threat by the year 2030. The biggest challenge to curing chronic hepatitis B is the elimination of
HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is the molecular basis for persistent HBV replication.
Existing antiviral therapies with interferon and/or nucleoside analogs can effectively suppress HBV replication
but do not significantly affect the level of HBV cccDNA. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover and develop
new classes of antiviral drugs capable of eliminating chronic HBV infection. In this regard, a more thorough
understanding of HBV infection, replication, and morphogenesis holds a great promise to identify novel targets
for antiviral drug discovery and development. Through preliminary studies, we have discovered that human
apolipoprotein E (apoE) is associated with infectious HBV. More importantly, our preliminary data suggest that
apoE plays critical roles in both HBV infection and morphogenesis. ApoE-specific antibodies could efficiently
neutralize HBV infectivity. Also, knockdown of apoE expression or knockout of apoE gene resulted in a
remarkable reduction of HBV infection and production. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that
apoE is incorporated into HBV virions and plays important roles in HBV infection and morphogenesis in vivo. The
overall goal of this application is to determine the role and underlying molecular mechanisms of apoE in the
promotion of HBV infection and morphogenesis in cell culture and in vivo. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine
the importance of apoE in the infection and morphogenesis of clinical HBV isolates; 2) to determine apoE-binding
receptors and apoE-receptor interactions important for efficient HBV infection; and 3) to illustrate the underlying
molecular mechanism of apoE-mediated promotion of HBV morphogenesis. The successful completion of this
application will result in a paradigm change regarding the roles of cellular proteins in HBV infection and
morphogenesis. The outcomes of our studies will also provide novel molecular targets for discovery and
development of antiviral drugs towards the ultimate elimination of HBV infection."
11060618,"Since its inception in 1990, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at New York University Langone
Health has facilitated pioneering research to define transitions from normal aging to the subjective cognitive
decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and early dementia stages of AD; as well as AD biomarker
development. Here we propose to continue this long-standing successful research direction with a focus on
understanding disease heterogeneity and delineating biomarkers and their role in these transitions, with
the long-term goal of helping to develop novel interventions that will delay or prevent cognitive decline.
The NYU ADRC has built an infrastructure that supports innovative research on AD and related dementias
(ADRD) to help achieve the NAPA goal of a cure by 2025. This will be facilitated by our nine highly successful
and interactive Cores (Admin; Clinical; Data Management & Statistical [DMS]; Neuropathology; Outreach,
Education & Engagement [ORE]; Neuroimaging; Biomarker; Psychosocial; and Research Education Component
[REC]). Together, our highly integrated cores will achieve the following aims: Aim 1. Enhance the performance
of innovative research in ADRC by maintaining nine cores that focus on delineating biomarkers of the transitions
from normal aging to SCD, MCI, and early dementia, and determining their roles to help develop novel
interventions that delay or prevent these transitions. We will also facilitate training in this area. Aim 2. Contribute
to the national network of ADRCs by providing clinical data, autopsy diagnoses, neuroimaging and biosamples
to NACC and NCRAD, as well as to other research community collaborative efforts in ADRD. Aim 3. Recruit and
retain a diverse subject population from clinical and community settings, via the ORE and Psychosocial Cores,
with concomitant engagement of the local scientific and lay community in ADRD with seminars, poster sessions
and the developmental projects via the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. Aim 4. Foster the development of novel
avenues of investigation with methodological developments by the cores (via innovative cognitive assessments,
neuroimaging techniques, biomarkers and proteomic approaches), and encourage, recruit, and select
developmental projects. Aim 5. Accelerate translational research across the ADRD spectrum by using
biomarkers to better define the underlying disease heterogeneity and foster the development of novel therapeutic
interventions that consider this heterogeneity. Aim 6. Facilitate the education and training of a diverse ADRD
workforce. Our Center will enhance the scientific community's understanding of ADRD and expand the next
generation of diverse ADRD scientists, via combined efforts of the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. In summary,
the NYU ADRD has facilitated pioneering research that defined the stage transitions from normal aging to
dementia, and contributed to AD biomarker development from its inception. In the next five years of funding, this
focus will be expanded by: 1) improving our understanding of disease heterogeneity; 2) identifying new biomarkers
that will allow early detection; and 3) fostering research that will develop effective therapeutic interventions."

11057891,"Project Summary / Abstract
The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood microbiome patterns are associated
with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Our laboratory has previously examined in detail the biomarker potential of peripheral blood
epigenetic changes both to predict future rapid radiographic/pain progression in patients who already have early knee OA, as
well as to detect preclinical OA (e.g. patients who do not have radiographic OA but will develop it in the near future). Thus,
we have access to a large number (>1800) of peripheral blood DNA specimens that can be used for additional analyses.
Furthermore, our laboratory and others have shown the importance of the gut microbiome to OA susceptibility and
progression, and we have recently generated the first data regarding the presence of an articular (joint) microbiome.
Presumably this joint microbiome develops due to hematogenous spread of bacteria/bacterial products from the gut. In the
current study, we will look for the presence of these bacteria/bacterial DNA within peripheral blood samples in the context of
OA. Our first Aim is to determine whether differences in baseline peripheral blood bacterial DNA patterns are predictive of
future radiographic and/or pain progression (within the next 24 months) in early knee OA patients, and we will develop
machine-learning biomarker models to discriminate future progressors from nonprogressors, using DNA samples from the
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), and the Systematic Oklahoma Osteoarthritis
iNflammation and Epigenetics Research (SOONER) cohort. In our second Aim, we will determine whether differences in
baseline peripheral blood bacterial DNA patterns can be used to predict preclinical OA among healthy patients from the OAI
who went on to develop radiographic knee OA within 12-96 months. The proposed work is important, as we do not have a
full understanding of how various microbiome niches influence OA risk, nor do we have robust clinically-available
biomarkers to distinguish future OA progressors or detect preclinical disease. Our work is quite innovative in its
hypothesis of a gut:blood:joint microbiome in OA pathogenesis, as well as the use of cutting-edge deep sequencing of
microbial DNA and machine learning methods to develop discriminatory models. Success in our proposal may open a new
avenue for OA microbiome research and may offer a novel treatment strategy for OA."
11057937,"Despite recent advances in gene editing, the ability to make small changes in the genomes of model
organisms remains a challenge. In zebrafish, enhanced oligo design, base-editing and prime-editing show
promise to increase the frequencies of small changes but their application is still cumbersome due to low
germline transmission rates, requiring extensive and time-consuming screening. This bottleneck prevents the
efficient targeted production single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for disease modeling, limits our ability
to perform mechanistic structure-function studies, and prevents rigorous determination and the assessment
of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) that promote human disease. The overarching goal of the proposed
experiments is to create a gene editing method to efficiently introduce SNPs and VAPs into the zebrafish
genome for modeling human health. We have used short regions of homology surrounding a CRISPR/Cas9
double strand breaks to efficiently target integration of DNA cargos for mutagenesis, protein tagging, Gal4
reporters, Cre-drivers and conditional alleles, using a method we have coined GeneWeld. Key to this
methodology is repair at a double strand break in genome produced by injection of Cas9 mRNA and a
genomic gRNA with a plasmid template. The circular plasmid template is cut in vivo with a gRNA, called a
universal gRNA (3), that recognizes sequences adjacent to the short homology to produce a linear template
for integration. The repair and subsequent integration of the cargo is likely utilizing microhomology-mediated
end joining (MMEJ) or a single-strand annealing (SSA) mechanism and results in germline transmission of
the targeted integration events in approximately 50% of the F0 injected embryos to the next generation. Since
this methodology remains more efficient that other strategies for targeted CRISPR/Cas9-targeted integration
in zebrafish, we propose that GeneWeld can be used to efficiently target ingression of SNPs and VUS into
the zebrafish genome. For this, we will test the ability of GeneWeld to introduce SNPs at three different loci.
We will also examine whether co-selection of RFP repair correlates with ingression of small changes in the
genome at a separate gene. Additionally, we will enhance the ability to generate SNPs and VUS in zebrafish
by overexpression of DNA repair enzymes and dominant mutations in repair enzymes. Key preliminary data
indicates that overexpression of a variant of Rad51 reproducibly enhances repair. We will use this approach
to examine the activity of Rad51 for the ingression of small nucleotide changes. The proposed experiments
are expected to develop simple and efficient methods to target SNPs and VUS into any gene in the zebrafish
genome. In addition, we will generate an important model with a dead RFP knock-in that will be of great utility
to assess editing and may provide a means for co-selection of editing events. Based on the ability of
GeneWeld to be used in other organisms, we expect these methodologies to be broadly applicable to animal
models used by the NIH."
11059608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vibrio cholerae (Vc), the causative agent of cholera, colonizes the mucosal surface of the small intestine. Infec-
tion is mediated via virulence factors to penetrate the mucus layer, attach to epithelial cells, and proliferate, all
the while modulating interactions with both host cells and the gut microbiota. The human gut microbiota is
highly diverse, and interpersonal variation in the structure and function of the microbiota drives dramatic differ-
ences in Vc colonization. At the center of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions lies the host mucus
layer, comprised of secreted mucin glycoproteins including the dominant mucin MUC-2. Mucus provides at-
tachment sites and carbon sources for both pathogens and commensal members of the gut microbiota at the
interface of the epithelium and the gut lumen, as provides a key physical barrier to infection. However, the role
of mucin metabolism in metabolic interchanges between Vc and specific configurations of the gut microbiota,
and the resulting impact on personalized Vc infection outcomes, has not been well studied. Here, we show that
TagA, a secreted metalloprotease upregulated by the Vc virulence master regulator ToxT, promotes Vc growth
in mucin, and that TagA is a bifunctional protein, acting as both mucinase and a mucus secretagogue that in-
duces host mucin production. Using a combination of ex vivo tissue culture and in vivo gnotobiotic mouse
colonization models combined with TagA mutants lacking either proteolytic activity or MUC2-inducing activity,
we found that TagA’s two activities have different effects on Vc fitness during infection depending on the pres-
ence of specific human gut microbes. We have generated model gut microbiota characteristic of human gut
microbiota states: one model microbial community similar to that of healthy individuals, which promotes Vc in-
fection resistance, and another model microbiota characteristic of the dysbiotic state found in cholera endemic
areas associated with high susceptibility to Vc colonization. TagA mucolytic activity is important for Vc infection
resistance within the colonization-resistant microbiota, while the mucin-inducing activity of TagA FN3 leads to
increased Vc infection within dysbiotic communities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Tag drives Vc metabolic
interactions with specific gut microbiota leading to community-specific attachment, growth, and overall infection
outcomes. We will test aspects of this core hypothesis in four specific aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms
driving mucin-dependent interactions of Vc with commensal gut microbes in epithelial attachment and growth.
Aim 2 will examine how personalized gut microbiota structure in cholera endemic areas modulates mucin- and
TagA-dependent disease phenotypes. Aim 3 will determine how TagA-microbiota interactions drives produc-
tion and metabolism of host mucins. Finally, Aim 4 will elucidate the role of proximity and spatial specificity in
driving microbiota-dependent Vc disease outcomes. The ultimate goal of this application is to shed light on the
role of pathogen-mediated mucin metabolism in microbial interactions during enteric infection."
11059609,"Title: PROTECT – Harnessing PROTEin degradation for Advanced Childhood Tumors
Abstract:
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued over the past three
decades making them the most common cause of disease-related mortality in this age group. After
decades of optimizing chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid
tumors will no longer be achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative
interventions that specifically target the unique biology of these tumors, which are often driven by
oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific oncoproteins historically considered difficult drug targets.
With advances in targeted protein degradation and chemical interventions to inhibit protein-protein
interactions, it has recently become tractable to target these proteins previously thought to be
“undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional screening approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed
new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young patients harnessing
the power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of world-leading experts in pediatric
oncology, targeted protein degradation, high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry,
structural biology, tumor biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-
Atlantic group of engaged patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk efforts with others
nearing clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore
different approaches to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome
resistance to available targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of CAR-T
treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated developmental cycles of
paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets including a viable financial model to de-risk
such developments for such rare pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we
anticipate success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its application in
early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously “undruggable” targets, (iii) providing
mechanistic insights into disease, novel targets, and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle
them."
11059615,"ABSTRACT
The dynamic regulation of the proteome is critical for cell survival and function. Traditionally, researchers have
focused on elucidating the discrete steps of protein synthesis, quality control, and degradation to understand
how the proteome is formed and maintained. Yet, a growing body of research suggests communication
between translation, quality control, and protein degradation pathways enables the cell to maintain protein
homeostasis (proteostasis). Proteostasis collapse is a hallmark of aging and aging-associated
neurodegenerative diseases, and alleles of proteostasis genes are associated with a wide range of human
genetic diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that underlie proteostasis holds promise for the
identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic intervention strategies to improve health across the lifespan.
My research program will address how protein quality control factors interact and feedback to regulate
translation. Our overarching goal is to determine the mechanisms by which protein degradation factors
collaborate with the translational machinery to synthesize proteins. We hypothesize that the dynamic regulation
of mRNA translation requires protein quality control and degradation activities to prevent catastrophic
proteostatic collapse. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that inhibition of the ubiquitin-
proteasome system feeds back to (i) inhibit global translation activity, and (ii) impairs the dynamics of RNA-
protein (RNP) granules that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs. In the next five years, my research
group will evaluate the role of protein quality control and degradation factors in mediating protein synthesis at
the levels of translation initiation, elongation, and by facilitating the dynamic assembly and disassembly of RNP
granules. To begin to address this problem, we will answer the following questions: (1) Is translation elongation
differentially regulated during proteostatic stress? (2) What is the role of the protein quality control machinery in
mediating translation initiation and elongation? (3) What is the relationship between translation and RNP
granules? (4) What are the molecular mechanisms by which protein quality control and degradation factors
drive RNP granule disassembly? We will leverage advanced genome engineering, optogenetics, and live cell
imaging strategies to define the mechanisms that regulate mRNA translation in human cells in response to
proteostatic stressors. The outcome of this research will be a spatially and temporally defined map of the
molecular mechanisms governing mRNA translation during proteostatic stress. The impact of this work will be
in contributing to our knowledge of how proteostasis is maintained in eukaryotes and identifying novel
treatment approaches for a wide range of human diseases that arise due to loss of proteostasis."
11059630,"Advances in organ transplantation have significantly improved allograft and patient
survival. However, chronic immune rejection remains a significant basis for graft failure across
organ types. For example, allograft failure due to immune-mediated rejection is the most common
reason for kidney re-transplantation. In cardiac transplant, allograft vasculopathy, a hallmark of
chronic rejection, is one of the most common causes of death in recipients beyond 3 years of
transplantation and, similarly, chronic
beyond
therapies
 lung allograft dysfunction is the leading cause of death
 1 year of lung transplantation. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop effective
to halt and reverse damage due to chronic rejection.A hallmark of chronic rejection is
fibrosis which progressively replaces functional tissue ultimately leading to allograft failure. This
proposal seeks to modify the natural history of progressive fibrosis in the allograft.
 Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote fibrosis that shield the tumor from the
immune system and therapies. One approach to deplete pathogenic fibrosis within the tumor
microenvironment targets fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface proteolytic enzyme
that is expressed by activated fibroblasts. Pre-clinical studies have shown anti-tumor efficacy of
FAP-targeted immunotherapy and have spurred clinical trials aimed at eliminating FAP+
fibroblasts. One strategy employing FAP-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has
yielded impressive tumor regressions in murine models. Recently, FAP-CAR T cells have also
been shown to reverse pathologic cardiac fibrosis that occurs following myocardial injury. In
addition to paving the way for use of CAR T cells for restoration of organ function in common non-
cancer conditions, this work also clearly implicates FAP+ fibroblasts as an important cell type in
collagen deposition in the context of malignancy as well as non-malignant tissue fibrosis.
 Our preliminary data demonstrates FAP expression in lung, kidney, and cardiac allografts
undergoing rejection with associated fibrosis. The presence of FAP across species and allograft
types suggests FAP/FAP+ cells are an important participant in allograft fibrosis. Therefore, we
hypothesize that chronic rejection leads to FAP+ fibroblast accumulation which promotes
deposition of extracellular matrix leading to fibrosis and progressive allograft dysfunction. The
proposed studies seek to define the expression of FAP in the context of allograft rejection,
determine the contribution of FAP and FAP+ cells to allograft dysfunction, and test a CAR T
approach to mitigating fibrosis."
11059765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Daily cannabis use among young adults aged 18-26 years is at historically high levels and >4.8 million young
adults meet criteria for cannabis use disorder (CUD). Heavy cannabis exposure during brain development
adversely affects cognition, emotions, risk for psychiatric disorders, and educational and other social
outcomes. However, most young adults with CUD do not receive treatment, with disparities by sex and
race/ethnicity. Brief motivational interventions may be effective for CUD in young adults, but effects are small
and evidence is of low quality. Combining motivational interventions with other approaches may enhance
effectiveness, and provision in primary care and use of telehealth may improve reach and reduce disparities.
We have developed a novel intervention, MOMENT-V, that combines telehealth motivational enhancement
therapy (MET) with mobile health (mHealth) ecological momentary intervention (EMI) to provide a fully remote
brief intervention for CUD in young adults seen in primary care, building on our prior research on cannabis use
in daily life, a brief intervention with in-person MET plus EMI, adapting in-person counseling for the virtual
environment, and brief interventions in primary care. In an open pilot, 100% of young adults were retained, and
satisfaction and engagement with MOMENT-V was high. We now propose a pilot randomized controlled trial of
MOMENT-V vs. enhanced usual care in 60 young adults aged 18-26 years with CUD recruited from primary
care clinics, using mixed methods and with follow-up at 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The specific aims
are to determine 1) intervention feasibility (primary outcomes: intervention completion, EMI engagement,
acceptability), 2) trial feasibility (primary outcomes: screening, eligibility, enrollment, retention), and 3)
preliminary efficacy (primary outcomes: cannabis use frequency, problems from/negative consequences of
cannabis use). Primary outcomes will be evaluated against a priori benchmarks. Secondary outcomes will
include MET adherence to motivational interviewing principles, therapeutic alliance, duration of study activities,
barriers, facilitators, CUD symptoms, amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) used in standard units,
motivation to change use, psychological distress, cognitive function, and quality of life. All intervention and trial
procedures will be conducted remotely. Additionally, we will explore the feasibility of videorecorded and live
video-observed oral fluid testing for THC and of using these results to assess cannabis reduction in a fully
remote trial. This proposal is responsive to PAR-22-183 areas of special interest, including research that uses
innovative technologies and Stage I treatment development research testing behavioral interventions within
primary care. Results will be used to develop an R01 proposal for a fully powered randomized controlled trial to
test the effectiveness of MOMENT-V. Findings from the proposed study will enhance efforts to provide high-
quality brief treatment to diverse populations of young adults with CUD and inform research using telehealth,
mHealth, remote trial implementation, and oral fluid testing to objectively assess cannabis use reduction."

Exposure therapy is the most effective treatment available for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), yet up to
50% of patients do not recover. Progress has stalled because we do not fully understand how or why exposure
exerts its effects. Studies that test mechanistic theories of exposure (based on habituation or inhibitory learning
models) have yielded mixed findings for both self-report and physiological mechanisms, with a near exclusive
focus on group-level effects in tightly controlled settings. While exposure likely works differently for different
people, research on which mechanisms are most important for which individuals has been absent. As a result,
clinicians are left to navigate mixed findings from different theoretical models, leading to variability in how they
conduct exposure and greater treatment failures among patients suffering with OCD. The primary objective of
this proposal is to determine which target mechanisms are most critical to engage in real-world exposure
sessions to produce treatment response. Adult participants (N = 400) with OCD receiving exposure therapy
from two sites (McLean Hospital, San Diego State University) across the continuum of care (outpatient, partial
hospital, residential) will complete baseline clinical and demographic measures as well as weekly symptom
reports. We will measure exposure mechanisms across three levels of analysis (self-report, observer-rated
behavior, physiology) during each exposure session. Mechanisms assessed will include a broad range of
variables based on both habituation and inhibitory learning models of exposure. For self-report and observer-
rated mechanisms, we will use the Exposure Feedback Form (EFF), created and piloted by the study team.
For physiological mechanisms, we will measure skin conductance response, heart rate, and heart rate
variability via a wearable device. Leveraging machine learning analyses, we will develop a predictive model of
patient outcomes (OCD symptoms) that incorporates both mechanistic data and baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics. At the group level, we will test the hypotheses that incorporation of mechanistic
variables will improve predictive performance over baseline variables alone, and that greater habituation and
inhibitory learning will predict superior clinical outcomes. At the individual level, we will test the hypotheses that
lower baseline depression and greater anxiety sensitivity will predict stronger habituation-outcome
relationships, whereas lower baseline self-efficacy and sexual minority identity will predict stronger inhibitory
learning-outcome relationships. This will be the first study to predict mechanism-outcome relationships for
exposure therapy based on individual characteristics. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 3, this
proposal aims to identify therapeutic targets for personalized interventions by utilizing innovative machine
learning approaches with scalable methods. Future studies will translate insights gained from this project to
test implementation of personalized medicine approaches to exposure therapy, with the ultimate goal of
improving care for the many patients who do not remit following exposure for OCD."

Debilitating pain, a hallmark of tissue injury and neuropathy, is an unmet clinical challenge particularly in
musculoskeletal diseases, such as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur following orthopedic surgery
and traumatic injuries, manifests with pathological bone formation in muscle and connective tissues. However,
little progress has been made in developing effective treatments for either HO or its associated pain.
Persistent neuropathic pain can arise from hyperexcitability of sensory neuron nociceptors in dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), which release neuropeptides, interact with immune cells, and modulate the host response
after injury to innervated tissues including bone and muscle. A critical link between bone homeostasis and
neuropathic pain has been suggested by the impaired ossification and bone loss in mice lacking Trpv1+
nociceptors. Although the mechanisms that underlie HO formation or HO related pain are poorly understood,
important insights derive from studies of an hereditary HO subset, namely Fibrodysplasia Ossificans
Progressiva (FOP). FOP is commonly caused by an arginine206 to histidine gain-of-function point mutation in
the BMP type I receptor (ACVR1, also known as ALK2) in 97% of patients. We recently found that adult
patients with FOP have baseline heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, in the absence of an inflammatory
flareup. Utilizing FOP patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nociceptive sensory neurons
(iSNs), we demonstrated that ACVR1R206H is both necessary and sufficient for the hyperexcitability of
nociceptors, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. To determine whether neuronal ACVR1 hyperactivity is also
relevant to more common neuropathic pain conditions, we conditionally expressed activating Acvr1R206H in
sensory neurons of non-FOP transgenic mice. This led to a remarkable recapitulation of the mechanical and
heat hypersensitivity in patients with FOP. As Acvr1 expression is profoundly increased in axotomized DRG
neurons in a traditional preclinical model of neuropathic pain produced by spared nerve injury (SNI), we found
that inhibiting injury-induced active neuronal ACVR1 signaling in the DRG by intrathecal (IT) injections of a
small-molecule ACVR1/ALK2 kinase inhibitor prevented injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and, most
importantly, reversed persistent pain in the mouse SNI model. Based on our observation that trauma-induced
HO triggered massive nociceptor sprouting at the injury site in a preclinical mouse model of FOP, we further
hypothesize that active ACVR1 signaling in sensory neurons is a critical link between neuropathic pain and
HO. Together, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms downstream of active ACVR1 signaling, mechanisms that
may be shared by other chronic pain and musculoskeletal injury conditions; while developing new treatment
strategies, we will define molecular targets of sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 that contribute to neuropathic
pain (Aim 1); validate if inhibiting peripheral neuronal ACVR1 reduces hypersensitivity (Aim 2); and determine
if sensory neuron-specific ACVR1 contributes to injury-induced HO (Aim 3)."

Individuals with cystic fibrosis receive routine medical care from a multi-specialty team of  medical providers. Each CF care team member a patient interacts tends to be focused on a unique primary goal for their treatment plan. For example, pulmonologists are focused primarily on respiratory health and may overlook the individual’s oral health care needs. A dietician may be more focused on ensuring that the individual with CF is gaining weight, and thus will advise their patients to eat carbohydrate-rich foods and fruit juices. However, the absence of attention to oral health and advice that is in direct conflict with the goals of optimal oral health may create a scenario in which the individual receives inconsistent messaging from various providers, which could be harmful to their oral health and a factor that would need to be addressed in future oral health-focused interventions. In this project, I will conduct 60 interviews with CF care providers, including nurses, respiratory therapists, physical therapists, social workers, dieticians, and pulmonologists. This study is a supplement to a 5-year observational U01 parent study that investigates the behavioral risk factors for oral health disease for individuals with cystic fibrosis. The parent study is the largest and first longitudinal CF oral health study to date, and the first to evaluate respiratory outcomes associated with oral diseases in CF. We will compare our provider interview findings to the findings of the larger parent U01 study, which will consist of survey responses, qualitative interviews, oral health data, and lung health data for 210 study participants with cystic fibrosis. This supplemental study expands on the parent study by providing insight into what CF care providers are communicating to patients, and how this communication impacts oral health. This study will allow us to see risk factor connections across the data, in partnership with the first aim of the parent U01 study, and to develop behavioral interventions involving CF care providers that are aimed at promoting oral health in individuals with CF."
11061954,"1 Project Summary: “Role of Rab10 in Alzheimer’s disease, K99/R00”
 2 Candidate: My long-term career goals center on the establishment of a leading research laboratory in
 3 academia focused on defining key molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s
 4 disease (AD). Specifically, my recent research interests have narrowed to ask how key regulators of endocytic
 5 trafficking pathways, particularly Rab GTPases and their modifiers, contribute to neuroinflammation associated
 6 with AD. I am a biochemist with training in biophysics and cell biology, with the included proposal for additional
 7 training in mouse models of disease. These training experiences will facilitate future investigations in molecular
 8 mechanisms underlying endocytic dysfunction that manifest in disease relevant phenotypes.
 9 Training: Here I propose a series of training that include a translational in vivo experiment in mouse models
10 coupled with formal coursework to accelerate my trajectory towards independence in the R00 phase. These
11 training experiences will be facilitated through mentorship from Dr. Andrew West, in addition to a Transition
12 Advisory committee at Duke University composed of Dr. Patrick Sullivan, an expert in mouse AD models, Dr.
13 Carol Colton, an expert in microglia function in AD models, and Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, a Nobel-laureate expert
14 in biochemistry and cell biology. Formal course work that is planned will further enhance training on in vivo
15 study approaches, grant writing, mentoring skills, lab management and responsible conduct in research.
16 Research: Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Rab10 3’UTR rs142787485 has been linked with
17 strong resiliency to AD susceptibility. Transcriptomic analysis reveals Rab10 mRNA as higher in AD patient
18 brains compared to healthy controls. My latest post-doctoral work disclosed that the Rab10 GTPase, highly
19 expressed in phagocytic cells, operates in a specific compartment of the endolysosomal pathway to control
20 fluid phase macropinocytosis. Preliminary data included herein suggests knockdown of Rab10 decreases the
21 internalization of aggregated tau in mouse primary microglia. Recent findings suggest internalized tau
22 aggregates break endolysosomes in microglia that stimulate inflammasome activation and the secretion of
23 damaging cytokines. Inflammasome activation may accelerate tau pathology, potentially linking Rab10 with
24 neuroinflammatory pathways important in AD. I plan to explore this novel disease-associated cycle in K99 and
25 R00 work. In the K99 phase, I would test the hypothesis that suppression of Rab10 in the P301S Tau/APOE4
26 mouse model ameliorates neuroinflammation and neuropathology. In the R00 phase, I plan to investigate how
27 Rab10 might regulate aggregated tau uptake, processing, and responses in microglia, as well as key
28 regulators of Rab10 activity that influence different endocytic trafficking pathways and immunological
29 responses. These proposed experiments would start to elucidate the potential roles of Rab10 in AD, and
30 identify novel pathways that might be exploited in the future for therapeutic gain.

SUMMARY
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in the US, with ~20,000 new diagnoses
and ~11,000 deaths per year. This pernicious hematological malignancy has rapid progression and startling
mortality in untreated patients. This is particularly true for elderly patients (i.e., > 65 years of age), where up to
70% of newly diagnosed patients succumb within a year. These patients have worse prognoses, often cannot
tolerate the most aggressive (and effective) treatment courses, are less likely to obtain complete remission af-
ter standard induction and consolidation treatment, and are more likely to have serious complications and side
effects. Using bioinformatic and bench approaches, we found the leukemic cells show striking sensitivity to mi-
tochondrial toxins. Our subsequent research identified a correlation between lower coupling efficiency in the
mitochondria of AML cells and increased sensitivity to mitochondrial damage. We showed strong synergy be-
tween multiple combinations of mitochondria-targeting molecules and known anti-cancer agents in AML, but
not healthy cells, selectively killing cancer cells. We hypothesized that hematological cancers accrue substan-
tial mitochondrial damage but reduce activation of mitochondrial recycling (mitophagy), likely in an effort to
maintain their cell division potential. However, over-activating mitophagy causes a crisis that triggers pro-
grammed cell death pathways. To leverage these findings, we performed a high-throughput screen and identi-
fied 8 compounds that increased levels of mitophagic activator kinase PINK1, driving mitochondrial turnover.
Iterative structure-activity relationship studies yielded two analogs, named PS127B and PS127E, with CC50AML
in the nM range; healthy cells survived the drug at up to 20 times these concentrations. These molecules inhib-
it mitochondrial function, reduce oxygen consumption and ATP production, and activate several programmed
cell death pathways. These compounds also synergized with known AML chemotherapeutics, were effective
against primary AML cells (including leukemia stem cells), and reduced tumor burden and extended survival
in mice engrafted with human leukemia cells. A subsequent in silico screen of over 4 M compounds using two
predicted activities (apoptotic agonist and thioredoxin glutathione reductase inhibition) shared by multiple cyto-
toxic PS127-family members (but missing for non-cytotoxic members) identified 213 hits. 93 of these hits were
in a cluster of compounds with chemical similarity to the PS127 family. 23 others were in a second group,
structurally related to each other, but not to PS127. In this project, we will validate cheminformatics predictions
of these comounds’ molecular targets, determine their effects on cellular metabolism, and confirm that they
trigger mitophagic activation via the PINK1/Parkin axis in mammalian cells. Completion of the proposed exper-
iments will identify and characterize high-value leads for future pre-clinical studies of in murine models engraft-
ed with patient-derived leukemia cells, including PK/PD and treatment efficacy. This work will also validate tar-
geting mitochondria for autophagic degradation as a therapeutic strategy for AML.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second-most common cancer in American men1. Early diagnosis and advances in
therapeutic strategies have significantly improved overall survival; however, therapeutic resistance and cancer
cell metastasis remain a challenge. Indeed, the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa),
an aggressive form of PCa after Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) portends a poor prognosis, with overall
survival standing at 1.5 years.
The overall goal of our laboratory research is to develop bioengineered tools for targeted cancer therapy. We
recently discovered the existence of tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) between breast/prostate cancer cells and
endothelium that promote phenotypic changes allowing for increased metastasis7. These TNTs are actin
mediated and inhibition of Sec3, an exocyst complex, inhibited their formation and consequent alteration of
cancer cells into an aggressive phenotype. We then discovered that there further exists intercellular nanotubes
between breast cancer cells and natural killer T cells that hijack mitochondria, consequently dampening the
immune response. This mechanism, we postulate, could be one of many that lower the efficacy of
immunotherapy for cancers, necessitating research into its pathophysiology and consequent identification of
pharmacological target(s)
For PCa, we propose investigating the existence of TNTs and their inhibitors in improving response. We will
utilize Field Emission Scanning Electron and Confocal Microscopy to investigate TNTs in PCa/CRPCa cell lines
LNCaP, PC3 co-cultured with effector murine CD8, NK T-cells; before probing human PCa tissue patient derived
xenograft (PDX) models. We will then establish the role of endosidins, novel exocyst complex inhibitors, in
ameliorating TNT formation and hence mitochondrial transfer in the above models. The expected outcomes of
this research are evaluation of a novel therapeutic class of drug against PCa/CRPCa cells at least via inhibition
of TNTs. Its result will offer a synergistic tool in promoting immune mediated control of tumors, at least in
PCa/CRPCa progression. The broader positive impact of this project is to promote efficacy of current
immunotherapy efforts in PCa/CRPCa."

Fossil-fuel-related outdoor particulate matter, ozone, and first- or second-hand cigarette smoke collectively
afflict over 545 million people globally, half of which is made up of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and the other half with asthma cases [1] As of 2020, Pennsylvania led the country with the highest
excess mortality due to air pollution [2]. Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania, and Allentown, in particular, a
city within Lehigh Valley, represents one of the worst metropolitan regions in the nation with one of the highest
risks of asthma in the US [2]. However, there is an absolute absence of an early-warning system of
environmentally attributable risks for lower respiratory infection, asthma, and COPD, referred to herein as
chronic respiratory syndrome (CRS) for the general US population and vulnerable citizens of Pennsylvania in
particular. Furthermore, parsing out the emergent (ie., air pollution-attributable) from the legacy (ie., systemic
built environment, access, and socioeconomic disparity) risks represents a direct answer to the respiratory
health needs in Pennsylvania.
Our overarching goals focus on instituting an intelligent and agile early-warning system for two primary
stakeholders - citizens who can visualize CRS risks in maps and clinical providers in local healthcare settings
who can manage the patient flow through outbreak prediction. Our proposed Pennsylvania Asthma-COPD
Syndromic Surveillance (PASS) builds a nimble data analytic infrastructure capable of teasing apart the legacy
of underlying health vulnerabilities, apart from emergent environmental risks (e.g., fossil-fuel-related air
pollution), to protect the public from CRS by integrating publicly available secondary data streams. Ours will be
the first study to clarify how Pennsylvania's recurrent air pollution episodes and erratic weather patterns
contribute to 'outbreaks' of lower respiratory infections in children and asthma and COPD outbreaks in all age
groups within specific geographic locations. Accordingly, we will distinguish the time-varying nature of
Pennsylvania population vulnerabilities as a function of pollutant exposure burden, apart from built infrastructure
disparity, socioeconomic barriers, as well as the underlying susceptibility of the residents to propose a novel
definition of environmental justice target region (Al M 1 ). We will determine the burden of poor air quality on
CRS across Pennsylvania (AIM 2). Finally, we will build syndromic surveillance systems of CRS hotspots by
combining air quality data with underlying susceptibilities of the population (defined in terms of health, social,
and resource disparities) (AIM 3)."

physics with mesh-based geometric deep learning through differentiable programming, this project aims to
enable fast surrogate CFD/FSI simulations, epitomizing an innovative blend of machine learning with
domain-specific knowledge and allowing for rapid predictions of functional information such as blood flow
patterns, pressure and wall shear stresses. Furthermore, an ensemble Bayesian learning framework will
be developed to propagate and quantify uncertainties in model predictions, thereby enhancing the
reliability and trustworthiness of the results. Finally, the introduction of advanced visual analytics to
interpret vast hemodynamic data ensembles underscores the project's commitment to accessibility and
user-centric design. Collectively, these innovations aim to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability
of patient-specific hemodynamic modeling, making them more accessible and actionable for healthcare
professionals. The project's long-term goals include improving the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment
of cardiovascular diseases, aligning with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood lnstitute's (NHLBI) mission to
combat heart, lung, and blood diseases and extend the lives of those afflicted. By offering a novel

11051330,"Summary/Abstract
The poor suffer disproportionally from poor mental and physical health. Many causes for these
disparities have been considered, including low income. But, poor families' incomes are not only
low, but also often unstable and unpredictable. This instability creates uncertainty about
whether they will be able to safeguard their future wellbeing. According to the allostatic load
framework, prolonged activation of physiological stress responses will cause “wear and tear” on
the body, heightening risks of cardiovascular disease and of age-related metabolic diseases,
promoting cognitive decline and dementia, and accelerating cellular aging.
This R01 will study the causal effects of income instability on the psychological and physical
health of the poor. Our specific aims are to: 1) Identify the causal effect of income instability on
psychological health (e.g. depression, anxiety), biomarkers of stress (e.g. cortisol), and physical
health (e.g. blood pressure), 2) Decompose the effects identified in aim 1 into the effects of
predictable and unpredictable instability and compare to the impact of increasing the average
level of income, and 3) Investigate the channels through which effects on health occur,
including both economic and behavioral channels and estimate the impact of key moderating
factors (e.g. age, gender, baseline mental health).
The trial will be conducted in southwestern Bangladesh. We will manipulate income instability
by varying the number of work hours (and hence earnings) of participants in a cash-for-work
program. Participants in the first treatment arm will have a fixed work schedule, with the same
hours and earning each period. The hours and earnings of a second treatment arm will vary over
time, but the fluctuations will be known in advance. Finally, the number of work hours and
earnings of a third treatment arm will fluctuate unpredictably. Each of these arms will be
compared to a control group that is surveyed, but not offered additional work. Importantly, we
will vary income instability while holding the average level of income constant in order to
disentangle the impact of instability from the level-effect.
The study will create 1,867 new jobs that would not otherwise be available during the lean
season when jobs are scarce. The intervention has been designed so that the job opportunity
cannot make them worse off than they would otherwise have been in the absence of research."
11054715,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature and is a leading cause of death
and neurological disability in the United States (US). AIS impacts more than 700,000 Americans annually, with
a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the AIS economic burden will exceed
$180B in the US alone.
 Standard AIS therapies include FDA-approved thrombolysis using alteplase (i.e., tissue plasminogen
activator, tPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and earliest-possible thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions
(out to 24hrs). In contrast to thrombectomy, thrombolysis does not require confirmation of a vessel occlusion.
Because only ~10% of AIS victims are eligible for thrombectomy, thrombolysis remains a critical first line tool to
treat those diagnosed with AIS. When employed, thrombolysis is associated with a modest ~15% improvement
in stroke outcomes, resulting in only ~10% fully recovering. However, due to alteplase's ~7% dose-dependent
hemorrhage risk, thrombolysis remains contraindicated for mild and wake-up strokes which together make up
~60% of all AIS events. Currently, thrombolysis usage within the US remains low (~10%) with 90% of all AIS
victims only receiving palliative care. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the efficacy and safety of
thrombolysis and extend thrombolysis to more AIS victims.
 UNandUP has invented a novel nanoparticle-based thrombolysis platform to safely accelerate alteplase to
AIS-associated blood clots, thereby overcoming restrictive hemodynamics known to prevent alteplase from
reaching the occlusion. The platform overcomes this barrier by 1) conveying alteplase-conjugated magnetic
nanoparticles to the clot’s surface more than 350X faster than normal biological diffusion (so that lysis starts
within minutes versus hours), and 2) mechanically mixing alteplase at the clot’s surface to improve lysis using
an alteplase dose nearly 250X lower than currently approved (which promises to eliminate alteplase’s elevated
hemorrhage risk). C3i participation and FDA/regulatory meetings confirm a likely CDER pathway which,
although lengthier and more costly than a CDRH pathway, results in a commercially attractive pharmaceutical
product. The platform is affordable to hospitals, does not require precise knowledge of the clot’s location, and
is intended to support EMT transfers between spoke and hub stroke centers, thereby ensuring thrombectomy
is not delayed. Once proven safe and effective, UNandUP’s goal is to extend the benefits of thrombolysis to
nearly all 700,000 AIS victims, which is 10X more than currently treated. By leveraging UNandUP’s prior
success in developing magnetic nanoparticles and portable magnet systems, the aims of this effort can focus
on synthesizing cGMP nanoparticles using proprietary magnetic cores and conducting safety and efficacy
studies in support of an FDA-CDER regulatory approval process."
11059412,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with
no current therapies that significantly alter disease progression. Cigarette smoke (CS) is a major causative factor
in COPD that results in mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Alveolar epithelial type 2
cells (AEC2s) are essential progenitor cells for normal lung homeostasis (cell renewal) and epithelial repair after
CS injury and in COPD. Mitochondrial dysfunction and cell senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest, have been
implicated in COPD and may reduce AEC2 cell progenitor function and epithelial repair. The causative
mechanisms and functional consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction on AEC2 senescence and
epithelial repair in COPD remain major knowledge gaps and may provide new insights for the
development of therapeutic approaches. The major goal of this proposal is to determine how mitochondrial
dysfunction mediated by adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) contributes to cellular senescence and
abnormal epithelial cell repair in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adenine nucleotide translocase
2 (ANT2) is a mitochondrial ATP transporter critical for cell metabolism and fate. We have shown that ANT2
gene expression is reduced in lung tissue from patients with COPD and that ANT2 knockdown in human
bronchial epithelial cells results in reduced mitochondrial respiration (Kliment et al, J Cell Sci 2021). Our
preliminary data show that human ANT2 is specifically reduced in AEC2s from COPD lungs. Knockdown of
ANT2 in epithelial cells in vitro results in increased p21 and p16 (markers of senescence). In a mouse CS model
of COPD, loss of ANT2 in alveolar epithelial cells results in enhanced lung destruction (emphysema), increased
p21 and p16 in AEC2s, and increased ROS. This proposal will determine how ANT2 protects against
emphysema by modulating ROS production, mitochondrial metabolism and senescence in AEC2 cells
and epithelial repair after CS. Our study will determine the following: 1) To test the hypothesis that loss of
ANT2 in AEC2 cells drives senescence by increasing ROS and the DNA damage response (DDR). 2) To test
the hypothesis that loss of ANT2 shifts AEC2 metabolism and decreases repair capacity to promote COPD. 3)
To test the hypothesis that therapeutic restoration of ANT2 or removal of senescent cells can protect against
emphysema. The outcome of this proposal will define the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction and
shifts towards glycolytic metabolism due to loss of ANT2 drives senescence and dysregulated epithelial repair
in AEC2 cells in COPD. Elucidation of ANT2 as a major regulator of lung epithelial repair and senescence through

11059632,"The focus of this proposal is to develop and translate effective regulatory T cell (Treg) therapies to
suppress anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses to biotherapeutics such as clotting factor replacement
therapy for the monogenic disorder hemophilia. Despite high potential, current Treg-based treatments are
hampered by low starting numbers, challenges in scalability, and unwanted off-target suppression.
Redirecting specificity by engineering antibody-based synthetic receptors towards conformational
antigenic epitopes can surmount these obstacles. Whereas this concept has been highly successful in
generating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells for blood cancers, adapting engineered Tregs for
tolerance applications is still evolving. This proposal derives from our recent findings that a synthetic T cell
receptor fusion construct (TRuC) can suppress ADA responses to clotting factor VIII (FVIII) in a murine
model of hemophilia. TRuCs combine the specificity of an antibody with the internal signaling machinery
of a TCR by incorporating into the endogenous TCR-CD3 complex of the engineered Treg. We find that
the TCR-like signaling of TRuC Tregs can deliver suppression in a physiological manner. In contrast, the
non-physiological signaling of a CAR can negatively affect Treg suppressive capacity. Why different
engineered receptors with the same scFv would result in dramatically divergent signaling and functional
outcomes is as yet unclear.
This proposal combines mechanistic understanding of synthetic receptor engineering with targeted
potentiation of the Treg suppressive effect to achieve ADA tolerance. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis
that careful considerations in synthetic receptor design, such as receptor affinity need to be made such
that activation thresholds are regulated to maintain optimal suppressive function. Further, we will examine
mechanisms by which engineered Tregs with specificity to a soluble antigen like FVIII can suppress antigen
specific B cells. In Aim 2, we will explore strategies to enhance in vivo localization, persistence, and
functionality of TRuC Tregs. We will co-administer a novel single chain IL-2 immunocytokine to drive
selective proliferation of TRuC Tregs, biasing immune activation toward tolerogenic outcomes. In Aim 3,
we will evaluate TRuC Treg efficacy in the presence of established ADAs in combination with
pharmacological immunosuppressants to establish long term tolerance and lower the risk of ADA
recurrence. Successful completion of these aims will generate potent antigen specific Tregs for effective
suppression of ADA responses to biotherapeutics. These studies will provide proof of principle for the utility
and mechanism of action of engineered Tregs and provide steps for clinical translation. The modularity of
the components of this platform will allow ready extension to suppress ADAs for other conditions, in
autoimmune disease and transplantation tolerance."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), including oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) is
the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with the majority of deaths attributable to tumor metastasis
and failures in treatment. Because most cases of OCSCC result from tobacco and alcohol exposure, these
tumors are highly heterogeneous, greatly complicating diagnosis, treatment, and investigations into the biology
of this disease. We recently performed dissociated single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in OCSCC and
identified a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal state (HEM) with some features of classical EMT, yet persistent
expression of epithelial markers. Further investigation into HEM demonstrated its localization at the leading edge
of tumors where it appears to drive invasion and metastasis as well as poor outcomes in OCSCC. How does
HEM trigger worse outcomes in HNSCC patients? Based on recent multispectral, multiplexed imaging analysis,
we have found that HEM leads to exclusion of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes including T-cells. Thus,
understanding what underlying structural and biological features of a tumor dictate this phenotype of immune
exclusion and induce HEM is of critical importance to advancing diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapeutics
for HNSCC. We hypothesize that HEM reflects the underlying tumor architecture and the complex interplay
between cells in the OCSCC ecosystem. However, due to the heterogeneity of these tumors both biologically as
well as spatially, bulk and/or dissociated transcriptomic and proteomic techniques forego this critical information.
Our goal is to utilize advanced imaging approaches to mature a set of imaging-based biomarkers based on HEM
and its interactions with the immune system, thereby creating opportunities to advance patient stratification and
treatment of OCSCC. To test our hypothesis, we will: (1) Further define the effect of HEM on immune infiltration
using MSI, especially as it relates to specific architectural features of tumor morphology. We will utilize MSI to
analyze patient tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) to identify imaging-based metrics that
predict response. Next, (2) we will combine proteomic, transcriptomic, and histopathologic approaches while
retaining spatial information to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the spectrum of HEM states and
expression heterogeneity within the tumor environment that contributes to HEM. Finally, (3) we will establish
pathways to both train and mentor the next generation of head and neck cancer investigators, creating both
hands-on laboratory exchanges as well as portable education modules for use in community colleges. At the
research level, testing these hypotheses will provide critical insights into the relationship between tumor-
infiltrating immune cells and HEM, and the underlying expression states that direct HEM and ICI response more
broadly. From a DEIA lens, our work will aim to increase the diversity of investigators in the HNSCC community,
critical for the innovation needed to improve our ability to treat oral cancers, while also providing new ways to
study oral biology and diseases."
11060286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Refugee and immigrant “newcomer” youth who have arrived in the United States in the last five years
frequently have unmet mental health challenges and face significant cultural and structural barriers to
accessing quality health services. Newcomer youth represent racial and ethnic minority populations with
substantial health disparities, overwhelmingly have lower socioeconomic status, and live in lower income
communities. Social determinants of health (SDoH) within these communities drive disparities in behavioral
and mental health for newcomers, which are further exacerbated by other unique barriers such as
discrimination, fear of deportation, and acculturative stress.
The proposed project, “Meet Me on the Pitch (MMotP): Developing and testing a community-based sports and
behavioral health intervention for newcomer youth,” will develop and evaluate an innovative model that
integrates sports, school, and behavioral health to improve the health of newcomer youth. MMotP is a novel
approach that builds on evidence-based practices to promote health equity by using sports as a means of
fostering community and social emotional development. MMotP is co-designed with newcomer youth and their
coaches to address SDoH. By training trusted community members (specifically, soccer coaches) to deliver a
culturally responsive behavioral health intervention, MMotP transforms the traditional service delivery model
and addresses the specific needs of newcomer youth. It focuses on changing key SDoH at the community
level rather than on individual-level treatment and creates an entry point to health care for youth by training
coaches to provide basic support and referrals.
The study proposes a mixed-methods approach that aims to 1) develop and refine the MMotP intervention,
including an enhanced referral network; 2) assess its feasibility and acceptability among newcomer youth; and
3) measure the short-term impact of the intervention among newcomer youth. The study will employ a
transcreational framework for intervention design, engaging the community, program participants, and coaches
to plan, deliver, and evaluate the intervention. Focus groups and key informant interviews will inform
intervention development and refinement, followed by longitudinal surveys to assess program quality and
impact. Through a randomized controlled trial with 480 newcomer youth, the study will assess the short-term
effects of MMotP on mental health outcomes and the related SDoH of access to healthcare services, school
engagement, and social connection. Embedding a behavioral health intervention within community-based
sports programs provides an upstream leverage point for mental health screening and prevention, a pathway
to social and health services, and enhanced school engagement. If successful, this intervention and study
findings have the potential to transform behavioral health service delivery and ultimately improve health equity
for underserved youth nationwide."

To what extent is adaptive evolution predictable? Despite its importance in understanding the biology of human diseases,
including the evolution of viral and bacterial pathogens, the dynamics of genetic adaptation are still poorly understood. In
particular, few examples yet exist that have been dissected to the molecular level. Examples of adaptations from natural
systems and the use of model organisms are powerful tools that can be combined to make progress on this difficult
question. We have employed instances of “parallel evolution”, involving assemblages of species experiencing a common
regime of natural selection, to evaluate multiple outcomes of the process of adaptation. With this information, we can
learn about recurrent features of adaptation and infer constraints and regularities in the adaptive process. Our work
focused on the biomedically-important interaction between Na+,K+-ATPases and their regulatory steroidal-glycosides that
a large variety of plants and animals use as toxins to defend themselves from being eaten. Using a diverse set of animals
that have independently evolved resistance to steroidal-glycoside toxicity, including insects and vertebrates, we
discovered these diverse species most often evolve resistance via a small number of possible options (i.e. involving only
three of 41 possible sites in the protein that could be modified to confer resistance). These findings suggest that adaptive
evolution is often path-dependent, implying that the individual components of an adaptation must evolve in a prescribed,
and ultimately predictable, order. They also raise numerous questions about the nature of this path dependency, including
the extent to which it emerges from interactions among residues within a protein, or from the genomic background of the
species; whether it similarly constrains adaptation over short and longer time scales, and how generally it applies in
adaptive protein evolution. Here we propose three aims that address these questions, by combining approaches from
evolutionary genomics and molecular genetics. In Aim 1, we will use genome engineering in Drosophila to elucidate the
path dependence of the steroidal-glycoside resistance adaptation both at the level of its primary target (Na+,K+-ATPase)
and at the level of the whole genome. In Aim 2, we will determine which and how many genomic factors contribute to
naturally occurring variation within Drosophila populations. This information will reveal the relationship between within-
population and between-species genetic variation underlying the same trait, connecting short- and long-term dynamics of
the adaptive process. In Aim 3, we will use principles learned from molecular adaptation at Na+,K+-ATPase to
computationally predict and use genome engineering to functionally validate path dependent adaptation dynamics in
Drosophila for a diverse group of proteins, many of which (like Na+,K+-ATPase) have important roles in neurological
development and homeostasis. Together this work will greatly increase our understanding of the constraints on adaptive
protein evolution and the predictability of the genetic changes by which novel phenotypes emerge."
11062078,"Infections with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US.
In addition to causing cervical and other anogenital cancers and a rising incidence of head and neck cancer,
HPVs are responsible for an estimated 5% of cancers worldwide.
Importantly, persistent infection, and not an acute infection, is the primary risk factor for (cervical) cancer
development. Thus, understanding the virus-host interplay that promotes or restricts viral persistence has
important implications for HPV biology and human cancers.
Until recently, it has been challenging to study the immediate early events of the HPV lifecycle following
infection and how these events contribute to initial genome amplification during the establishment phase and
long-term viral persistence. We used a single-cell genomics approach to identify cellular factors involved in
viral infection and persistence.
The R01, this diversity supplement proposal is associated with, explores how protein arginine N-
methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) regulates RBM15 controlled m6a deposition on viral mRNA to regulate
alternative splicing throughout viral infection temporally. Amy Banka recently joined my lab to reanalyze large
published genomics datasets using gene coexpression networks. Specifically, by comparing transcriptomes of
HPV(+) cells along the progression from early infection to cancer progression, we aim to identify coexpression
networks that will illuminate how HPV rewires these cells throughout the viral life cycle. This approach may
identify new druggable targets or identify biomarkers to inform clinical practice."

We propose to remain a Member of the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN). As a
Charter Member of the Network, our proposal represents a logical extension of the long-standing commitment
of our Center to improve the care of children with chronic liver disease through innovative patient-based
research. In the previous grant cycles, we worked collaboratively with investigators from other Centers and
with the Scientific Data Coordinating Center to build a strong infrastructure to conduct patient-based studies on
biliary atresia, cholestatic syndromes, mitochondrial hepatopathies, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
Our key contributions in the previous cycle included: 1) leadership and/or partnership in the development of
network-wide clinical studies, with data analyses and publication of 34 original manuscripts of which 6 had lead
authors from Cincinnati; 2) completion of the PRIME and IMAGINE2 trials; 3) leadership in protocol
development and implementation of the PSC Observational Study; 4) leadership in whole exome sequencing
analysis of patients with mitochondrial hepatopathy; 5) high enrollment and retention of
subjects into prospective studies, including the PSC and FORCE studies; 6) timely processing of liver tissue by
the staff of RNA Purification Service and Bile Acid Analysis Service to support Network studies; and 7)
development of an MRI Core in collaboration with Perspectum Diagnostics to apply Al based analytics to
quantitatively predict biliary damage and liver fibrosis. We completed ancillary studies on the genetic basis of
intrahepatic cholestasis, the liver transcriptome in biliary atresia, and proteomic plasma biomarkers of portal
hypertension. We look forward to significantly contributing to the scientific goals and operational excellence of
ChiLDReN through four aims. In Aim 1, we will enroll subjects into prospective ChiLDReN protocols to enable
observational studies and translational science. This will be done by pursuing high enrollment rate of subjects
into approved protocols, with the timely collection and submission of data and tissue samples to meet the
enrollment goals established by the Network. In Aim 2, we will perform translational studies employing bulk
RNA and multiome sequencing of cryopreserved liver tissues, spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) on liver
sections, and Clink® based proteomics of plasma samples from patients with PSC to elucidate the role of the
TNF superfamily ligand TWEAK in the progression of biliary fibrosis in PSC. In Aim 3, we will assess the shortterm
efficacy and safety of systemic FXR agonist in the treatment of pediatric PSC. In Aim 4, we will establish a
Translational Science Coordination Center to support Network investigators with iPSC-derived model systems.
By pursuing the four aims, we will be well positioned to fully execute the new Network aims of pursuing
translational science projects and conducting trials to improve the outcome of children with cholestatic liver
diseases."

 This proposal aims to use noninvasive molecular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of pancreatic zinc
content and secretion to detect pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), as early pre-malignant pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) lesions. It is estimated that 55,440 people in the US will be diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer and 45,750 people will succumb to the disease in 2019. Current diagnostic techniques include
the use of imaging to localize a lesion and invasive biopsy sampling to stage the cancer and obtain molecular
and cellular information from the tumor. Once diagnosed, there are limited treatment options since symptomatic
patients will likely already have advanced stage PDAC. Therefore, there is a need to detect PDAC lesions early
and in a non-invasive manner. It is known that zinc is stored in zymogen granules in acinar cells at high levels
and that zinc homeostasis is uniquely dysregulated in PDAC. We have successfully demonstrated that MR
imaging with gadolinium (Gd)-based zinc sensors can report on zinc release from exocrine pancreatic tissue as
a response to caerulein stimulation. In this proposal we will evaluate a panel of secretagogues, which are
chemical compounds known to stimulate the secretion of zinc from ductal and/or acinar cells in the exocrine
pancreas, to optimize their ability to generate zinc flux detectable with our molecular MR probe. I will then use
this cell-specific metabolic zinc imaging technique to noninvasively quantify the zinc homeostatic dysregulation
in pancreatic cancer mouse models by MRI. Elucidating the role of zinc homeostasis in the development of
pancreatic adenocarcinoma by non-invasively measuring zinc release from acinar and ductal cells as a response
to their natural secretagogues will allow us to identify biomarkers that report on molecular transformations early
in the disease. This in turn could then enable patients to obtain a diagnosis at an early stage and thus have
access to more effective therapies and curative surgical options.
 The short-term goal of this project is to optimize and characterize the stimulated zinc secretion in the
exocrine pancreas and its detection in vivo with molecular MRI to identify early malignant transformations in
PDAC, in doing so I will obtain the training from my advisory committee, who are experts in the field of pancreatic
cancer molecular pathogenesis, histopathology, surgery, and radiology. Attaining my short-term goal will enable
me to obtain expertise in the following areas: 1) Clinical pathology techniques for diagnosis of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma. 2) Biomarker identification and validation. 3) Metabolic implications of zinc homeostasis in
PDAC pathogenesis. This project will also allow me to generate data that will enhance my probability of success
in obtaining independent NIH grant support. With the skills and knowledge obtained because of the research
and training activities from this proposal, I will be able to reach my long-term goal of becoming an independent
translational investigator using MRI to infer key metabolic, biological, and physiological characteristics of cancer
pathogenesis based on metal homeostasis."
11063653,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Parent R01 CA268055
Cisplatin (Cis)-based Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care prior to cystectomy, for patients
with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Up to 30% of patients respond and show no residual tumor at
cystectomy with >80% survival, but “non responders” have <30% chance of surviving 5 years. Thus, improving
the effectiveness of Cis-based NAC will greatly improve outcomes in BC. Through whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9
synthetic lethal screens in Cis-resistant human BC cell lines, we discovered NPEPPS as a novel and druggable
target whose expression determines sensitivity to Cis. NPEPPS was the only one of 13 M1 aminopeptidases
found to be synthetic lethal with Cis. Depletion of NPEPPS enhanced Cis therapy and reduced growth in animal
models. To find how NPEPPS drives these two phenotypes, we used mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the
proteins that are in complex with NPEPPS in BC cells. We found NPEPPS in complex with subunits (LRRC8A-
E) of the volume regulated anion channel (VRAC), a recently identified mechanism of platinum (Pt) cellular
import. In BC cells, LRRC8A/D depletion increases resistance to both cisplatin and carboplatin, while NPEPPS
depletion had the opposite effect. Supporting a role in human BC growth, NPEPPS expression is associated with
poor patient outcome regardless of chemotherapy use. Leveraging our MS results, we developed an approach
to prioritize candidate genes found in complex with NPEPPS that most likely affect growth, are associated with
aggressive disease, and are prognostic markers.
Thus, we propose the Guiding Hypothesis that NPEPPS
drives Pt resistance and tumor growth in BC by inhibiting VRAC activity and interacting with genes regulating
cell proliferation respectively. Specific Aims test this hypothesis with the Objective to lay the foundation for
novel approaches to improve the outcomes for BC patients.
In Aim 1 we
will test the hypothesis that NPEPPS
aminopeptidase activity is required for Pt resistance and growth using enzymatically dead NPEPPS mutants in
vitro and in vivo. Next, we evaluate our top candidate gene CHD2, a chromatin regulator and putative tumor
suppressor for its role in NPEPPS-driven tumor growth and the dependency of this role on NPEPPS enzymatic
activity. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of LRRC8A/D in NPEPPS-mediated Pt resistance. We have used
molecular modeling to identify residues on NPEPPS that interact with LRRC8A/D. Site-directed mutagenesis of
these residues will test the hypothesis that direct interaction of NPEPPS with LRRC8A/D reduces the ability of
VRACs to properly function and contributes to NPEPPS-mediated Pt resistance in vitro and in vivo. To establish
the preclinical rationale for the effect of novel, anti-neoplastic agents that circumvent Pt resistance, Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that Tosedostat (Tose), a clinically well-tolerated aminopeptidase inhibitor, enhances the
sensitivity of BC to Pt, and NPEPPS expression is required for this. The impact of Tose on BC cells ± NPEPPS
expression will be examined for growth, Pt sensitivity and import in vivo in human BC models of localized and
metastatic disease. Organoids derived from patient tumors before Cis-based NAC, will be tested with Pt ± Tose."

After decades of incremental changes to the food safety system, technological advancements
have ushered in a corresponding period of increased change for both food systems and food
safety. According to FDA’s most recent food safety initiative, the New Era of Smarter Food
Safety, many experts believe the pace of change will continue increasing over the next ten
years, perhaps even more than in recent decades. As old foods are reformulated, new foods are
created, new production and delivery methods are developed, and the entire system becomes
increasingly digitized, complexity for regulators is only going to increase.
The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) project entitled A People-Centered,
Technology-Driven, Scientific Approach to Advancing Conformance with the Voluntary National
Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Retail Program Standards) is intended to:
  Objective 1: Work with FDA and project partners to develop, refine, and improve the
 grant management system we developed to administer financial assistance to SLTT
 retail regulatory food programs based on FDA's Retail Flexible Funding Model (RFFM)
vision.
  Objective 2: Maintain the Self-Assessment and Verification Audit Online Course we
 developed in partnership with FDA and expand its use and value to SLTT jurisdictions.
  Objective 3: Establish the NEHA-NACCHO Mentor Academy to recruit and train a new
 generation of mentors, expanding our capacity to meet the increasing demand for
 expertise in the Retail Program Standards.
  Objective 4: Work with CFP and FDA to host a biennial Retail Program Standards
 Symposium and an annual Virtual RFFM Grant Year Kickoff Meeting, to engage current
 and attract new enrollees in the Retail Program Standards.
These four objectives will advance the Integrated Food Safety System (IFSS) requirements
found in the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and support the goal of building New
Business Models and Retail Standardization in the New Era of Smarter Food Safety.
By supporting SLTT retail food regulatory programs in their work toward uniformity and
encouraging increased active managerial controls, we will assist the FDA with their goal of
“bending the curve” of foodborne illness by reducing the number of illnesses and related deaths."
11064460,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Axonal degeneration is an early and likely initiating event in many of the most prevalent
neurodegenerative diseases. DLK is a major neuronal stress kinase that we identified as the first gene required
for pathological axon degeneration. Recently we defined the mechanism: DLK promotes the turnover of the
axon maintenance factors NMNAT2 and stathmin2 (STMN2). DLK is activated in animal models of both
Alzheimer's Disease and ALS and there are strong data that DLK is also activated in patients with these
degenerative disorders. While other labs focus on DLK pro-apoptotic signaling, we demonstrated an
independent function for DLK in stimulating SARM1-dependent axon loss. In these studies, we identified
STMN2 as an axonal maintenance factor—loss of STMN2 promotes axon degeneration and increased levels
of STMN2 inhibits axon degeneration. Recently, two prominent papers identified STMN2 as the major
transcript misspliced and downregulated by TDP-43 dysfunction in human iPSCs as well as from spinal cords
of ALS patients. TDP-43 dysregulation is an important cause of both frontotemporal dementia and ALS and
has recently been implicated in more common dementias. Indeed, STMN2 is one of the most downregulated
transcripts in neurons from Alzheimer's patients. The identification of STMN2 as a major target of both TDP-43
dysregulation and DLK activation, two mechanisms implicated in both dementias and ALS, identifies
downregulation of STMN2 as a candidate mechanism promoting axon loss in these neurodegenerative
diseases. These findings motivate our efforts to define the function of STMN2 for axonal maintenance. While it
is known that STMN2 is a stathmin family member that regulates microtubule dynamics, it is not known how
STMN2 promotes axon maintenance or the in vivo function of STMN2 for axon survival in health, injury, and
disease. Here we will test the hypothesis that STMN2 promotes the activity of the axon maintenance factor
NMNAT2 to inhibit the activity of SARM1, the executioner of pathological axon degeneration, and in vivo helps
regulate the choice between axon survival and self-destruction in injury and disease. If successful, these
studies will define the mechanism by which STMN2 promotes axonal survival and identify STMN2 as a
therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disease."

Suicide rates among Hispanics in the United States have increased in the last two decades; coupled with rapid
growth of the Hispanic population, suicide among Hispanics is a pressing public health issue. Considering the
role of culture in suicide can elucidate unique and modifiable mechanisms for suicide. The Candidate’s long-
term research goal is to optimize suicide prevention interventions for Hispanics by targeting cultural
determinants of health. Reaching that goal requires mentored training in three domains of suicide prevention
research and completion of a research project to produce substantive, foundational results (described below).
First, the candidate needs to gain expertise in randomized clinical trials methodology for suicide interventions
(Objective 1) to conduct a trial with at risk Spanish-speaking adults in a reliable, valid, and ethical manner, and
test target engagement with an experimental therapeutics approach. Second, the candidate needs to gain
expertise in optimizing behavioral interventions to impact cultural determinants of health via human-centered
design (Objective 2) to deliver a treatment protocol that is culturally-usable and optimized to increase cultural-
social engagement. Third, as smartphone technology increases precision to measure mechanisms, the
candidate needs to gain expertise in the use of novel smartphone technology for precise assessment of target
engagement in clinical trials (Objective 3) to optimally/ethically use this technology in clinical trials research.
The principal objective of the proposed research study is to use an experimental therapeutics approach to
examine whether a behavioral intervention (SOCIAL ENGAGE; S-ENGAGE) can increase cultural-social
engagement (intervention target) and decrease suicide risk (clinical outcome) among Hispanic adults.
First, human-centered design approaches will be used to iteratively refine and optimize S-ENGAGE to alter
cultural-social engagement via iterative feedback from 5 Spanish-speaking adults with low cultural-social
engagement and recent ideation. Second, 60 Spanish-speaking adults who report low cultural-social
engagement and recent ideation will be randomized into 10-weeks of S-ENGAGE or an expectancy-matched
control. Participants will provide 2-weeks of real-time data via smartphone at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-
month follow-up and complete semi-structured interviews. Research Aims are to: (1) Optimize S-ENGAGE for
target engagement. (2) Test target engagement: Does S-ENGAGE increase cultural-social engagement
among Spanish-speaking adults?; (3) Test clinical impact: Does S-ENGAGE decrease suicide risk among
Spanish-speaking adults?; (4) To contextualize findings: What components of S-ENGAGE were most helpful?
The resulting findings of this K23 project will function as the basis for a larger R01-funded study powered to
examine whether the proposed target (cultural-social engagement) leads to changes in the clinical outcome
(suicide ideation). The candidate will build on the skills acquired in this period of mentored career development
to contribute to the development and refinement of approaches to suicide prevention for Hispanics."

There is currently no validated treatment to prevent the development of acquired epilepsies, such as post-
traumatic epilepsy. The availability of biomarker that predicts, at an early stage, people at risk to develop epilepsy
and benefit from treatment interventions would significantly accelerate and de-risk the process of identifying an
antiepileptogenic therapy. In this study, that is based on collaborations and preliminary data derived from
EpiBioS4Rx, an NINDS funded Center without Walls, we aim to create a rigorous and effective preclinical model
to screen a new candidate treatment to prevent posttraumatic epilepsy in the lateral fluid percussion injury model
as well as identify biomarkers to guide treatment implementation. We will follow a multicenter, double-blinded,
vehicle-controlled, randomized preclinical antiepileptogenesis study following the high standards of rigor
advocated by NINDS, the AES/ILAE Translational Research Task Force and the ARRIVE guidelines. We have
formed a collaborative group of four international preclinical testing centers (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
University of Melbourne, two UCLA sites), supported by experts in pharmacokinetic modeling (University of
Minnesota), protein biomarker research (Uniformed Services University of the Health Services) and
bioinformatics (University of Southern California). We plan to test a compound that removes pathological iron
stores from the brain and test whether it can modify early biomarkers of epileptogenesis and injury. We aim to
identify (a) at least one panel of multimodal biomarkers that can predict early on treatment response to the iron
chelator, including the development of post-traumatic epileptogenesis, (b) at least one biomarker of
epileptogenesis, (c) and determine whether iron chelator treatment can prevent post-traumatic epilepsy

11054717,"Here we seek to improve the accuracy of hemodynamic modeling of cerebral aneurysms. This goal of this
project is to predict the outcome of cerebral aneurysm treatment. This is significant due to the prevalence of
cerebral aneurysms, their dismal prognosis when ruptured, and treatment failure rates (resulting in aneurysm
recurrence and risk of either brain hemorrhage or need for retreatment) of up to 40%. Hemodynamic forces are
thought to influence aneurysm treatment outcomes, and can be simulated using computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methods, but such studies have not been widely accepted due to conflicting results. Traditional CFD
analysis (termed “Eulerian” metrics) only studies the effect of blood flow on the vascular walls, largely ignoring
circulating blood products such as platelets that initiate intra-aneurysmal thrombosis (termed “Lagrangian”
metrics), which have a critical role in treatment outcome. Better prediction through a holistic approach
combining both types of analyses could identify patients at risk for treatment failure, influencing pre-surgical
decision-making.
 This project builds on our ongoing NIH-funded expertise (via a renewal of R01NS105692) in the CFD
modeling of cerebral aneurysms before and after treatment. We have developed an innovative method of
incorporating novel Lagrangian metrics, such as residence time and shear history, into CFD simulations in with
existing Eulerian hemodynamic metrics, to create a holistic approach to modeling the effects of aneurysm
treatment. Feasibility studies have characterized the post-treatment hemodynamic environment with special
attention to platelet-representative particles that experience prolonged intra-aneurysmal residence time and
low cumulative shear history within treated aneurysms. Previous in vitro studies of platelets in similar
conditions demonstrate thrombosis in such environments, which would be advantageous after aneurysm
treatment to develop a stable thrombus leading to aneurysm healing.
 First, we will perform CFD simulations before and after treatment on a cohort of cerebral aneurysms
whose treatment outcome (success or failure) is known. We will include both Eulerian and Lagrangian metrics
to determine associations with treatment outcome. Second, we will use an established animal model of
cerebral aneurysms, treated with commercially-available endovascular devices. We will perform CFD
simulations a similar holistic model as the human aneurysm cohort, and investigate the relationship between
Lagrangian metrics and treatment-related thrombosis on histological analysis. The final result will be an
optimized CFD methodology and set of Eulerian and Lagrangian variables predictive of outcome after cerebral
aneurysm embolization."
11054719,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite much effort to identify mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
lobar degeneration dementia (FTLD or FTD), effective treatments remain elusive. Motoneuron (MN) excitability
dysfunction remains the most tightly linked to ALS disease pathology. Much research has reported on disease
alterations in the excitability mechanisms of MNs. However, these data often conflict, as hyperexcitability,
hypoexcitability, and normal excitability have all been seen in animal models of ALS. Such inconsistent data
obscure the role of these excitability changes (i.e., neuroprotective or detrimental). Most of these conflicting
reports are seen in mutant super-oxide dismutase (SOD) models of ALS, the most commonly studied mouse
model of ALS. Our data obtained (via our active grant) from the aggressive G93A SOD mouse model of ALS
suggests that both hypo- and hyperexcitability disease changes might take place concurrently within diseased
MNs. Here, we propose to examine a recent, novel rNLS8 mouse model that recapitulates pathologic
Transactive-response DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP43) inclusions seen in upper and lower MNs in >90% of ALS
patients, leading to neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord. TDP43 is specifically seen in most sporadic-onset
ALS cases; thus, between them, the G93A and rNLS8 models represent most ALS, and also FTD, cases.
However, to date, excitability dysregulation has not been examined in this model. Thus, our objective is to
characterize the novel rNLS8 TDP43 mouse model of ALS and compare this data to our existing data from G93A
mice. Both models demonstrate very different disease scenario and progression, yet ultimately both lead to MN
loss and death. By comparing and contrasting mechanisms of excitability dysregulation between these models,
we expect to parse the roles that individual alterations play in ALS/FTD disease pathology via 3 Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model. It is currently unknown whether MN
excitability is altered in the rNLS8 model – as in other ALS models – and whether synaptic excitability dysfunction
is also involved. Thus, we will measure intrinsic MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model via
electrophysiology recordings, at early, middle, and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 2: Determine the roles of ion channels and synaptic inputs in the death of spinal MNs in rNLS8 mice.
We will measure expression levels of ion channels and synapses in spinal MNs of rNLS8 mice at early, middle,
and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 3: Determine the roles of ion channels & synaptic inputs in the death of cortical neurons in rNLS8
mice. Loss of cortical neurons in rNLS mice recapitulates key aspects of ALS-comorbid FTD. To examine if
excitability mechanisms involved in the death of spinal MNs are also involved in FTD dementia, we will measure
expression levels of ion channels and synapses in cortical/subcortical neurons of rNLS8 mice at early, mid, and
late disease stages."
11055208,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cells are the building blocks that comprise and pattern multicellular organisms from plants to humans, and
many types of cells themselves exhibit complex shapes and patterns. While we understand many of the
molecular components of cells, we know much less about how they are assembled to create patterns at the
cellular scale. RNA regionalization, or spatially distinct localization of transcripts, is known to contribute to
cellular morphology and function in various cells such as neurons. Several diseases that arise in the brain,
from depression to Alzheimer’s, may also partly be explained by mislocalized RNA. To understand how cells
are patterned via RNA regionalization, we must also understand how the genome is spatially organized as
nuclear architecture and chromatin structure both influence gene expression. My proposal leverages the
strengths of a unicellular system, Stentor coeruleus, that possesses a complex cellular architecture including a
mouth and tail, and is capable of regeneration when damaged. Stentor cells also harbor a transcriptionally
active macronucleus that spans the 1 mm long axis of the cell with a unique beads-on-a-string configuration
and contains more than 50,000 copies of the genome. These properties enable microsurgery to physically
separate regions of the cell and its nucleus along a defined axis for sub-cellular and sub-nuclear analyses of
RNA and genome regionalization by sequencing, which is not possible in traditional model systems. First, I will
examine two independent models for cellular patterning by RNA regionalization. With RNAi and RNA-
sequencing in bisected cells, I will determine whether RNA transport promotes cellular asymmetry by defining
the cytoskeletal elements and associated motors required for RNA regionalization. With RNA-sequencing in
individual ‘nodes’ of the macronucleus, I will also determine if gene expression is regionalized, thereby
reducing the distance RNA must travel before it reaches its destination. Then, with chromatin profiling and
whole-genome sequencing, I will determine whether the genome is regionalized by spatial chromatin regulation
or differential localization of genes themselves and establish whether these are associated with RNA
regionalization and ultimately cellular patterning. To conduct this work, I will receive training in cell biology and
imaging, chromatin biology and genomics, as well as in tool development in emerging model organisms. This
innovative work will serve as the foundation for my independent research program, which aims to advance our
understanding of the consequences of disrupted cellular patterning in development and disease."
11058034,"Project Summary: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease that afflicts ~1.5 million
Americans, particularly in the elderly populations. Despite its high mortality (80-90%) upon rupture, there is a
lack of effective drug therapies for clinical management of AAA. Surgical repairs remain the only effective
options; however, not only are they considered traumatic and risky, but also not indicated for the majority of
newly diagnosed AAA patients. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need to develop non-surgical strategies to
contain AAA progression. Dietary restrictions of amino acids emerge as promising avenues to combat
cardiovascular diseases. For the first time, our study demonstrated the potential of dietary methionine or
leucine restrictions in inhibiting the development of AAA in a rat model. It is well established that such dietary
restrictions trigger the amino acid starvation response, a potent protective mechanism driven by the metabolic
stress kinase general control nondepressible 2 (GCN2). Indeed, in our preliminary study, silencing GCN2 in rat
abdominal aorta nullified the benefits of methionine restriction against AAA, suggesting a protective role of
GCN2 in reinstating aortic homeostasis. Activating GCN2 through methionine restriction protected smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) from undergoing degeneration, which is one of the key determinants of AAA
pathogenesis; conversely, reduced GCN2 activity was robustly observed in clinical specimens of AAA, and
GCN2 silencing effectively compromised the protection against SMC degeneration. Finally, we serendipitously
identified GCN2 to be citrullinated by peptidyl arginine deiminase 3 (PADI3) at its 1475 arginine (R1475)
residue in the starvation-sensing domain. This post-translational modification (PTM) of GCN2 was increased in
AAA and correlated with repressed GCN2 activity. Collectively, these preliminary results lead to our central
hypothesis: GCN2 plays a pivotal role in protecting against SMC degeneration and AAA formation, and its
activity is negatively modulated by PADI3-mediated citrullination; GCN2-activating strategies offer a new
paradigm for effective prevention and intervention of AAA. In Aim 1, we will dissect the role of GCN2 in
safeguarding SMC homeostasis as well as its downstream signaling using human and murine SMCs. In Aim 2,
we will characterize a new PTM regulation that negatively modulates GCN2 activity and delineate the biological
consequences of GCN2 citrullination in SMC. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanistic and therapeutic
implications of GCN2 activation in AAA, utilizing both transgenic (SMC-specific GCN2 knockout mice) and
dietary intervention approaches (methionine restriction for treatment of pre-existing AAA lesions). The
successful completion of the proposed studies will not only uncover an intrinsic protective mechanism against
SMC degeneration and AAA pathogenesis, but also may provide a new paradigm through GCN2-activating
dietary restrictions for effective prevention and intervention of AAA."
11058170,"R21: Human Craniosynostosis Atlas (HuCA) : Standardizing & Establishing a Public Repository for
Genomic and Imaging data.
Project Abstract:
Craniosynostosis is a premature fusion of the cranial sutures which affects approximately 1 in 2000 babies
each year. Left untreated, significant skeletal, respiratory, ocular, and neurocognitive abnormalities can result.
Surgical treatment is usually offered in the first year of life to mitigate these consequences. There is a wide
genotypic and phenotypic presentation and to date there is insufficient characterization of the disease in
children, and its effects on the brain. The Human Craniosynostosis Atlas (HuCA) as put forth in this proposal
seeks to remedy this gap in knowledge by creating community resource with standards for data acquisition,
which will allow for a diverse array of sites to gather CT, multi-contrast MRI, and genomic data in individual
patients, which can be analyzed in concert. We ultimately seek to improve the characterization &
understanding of all types of craniosynostosis through systematic neuroimaging and genotyping shared with
the scientific community through the existing NIH-NIDCR biorepository, FaceBase 3. We propose to create the
first publicly accessible repository of comprehensive human data for the purpose of broadly, yet deeply
characterizing all types of craniosynostosis. Specific Aim 1 will focus on neuroimaging and establish low dose
head CT protocols to verify diagnosis and allow head shape analysis. Brain structure and function will be
assayed with MRI based on the Healthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) protocol for developing brains
and will be extended to the craniosynostosis population. Sequences will include anatomical imaging (T1, T2),
functional (resting state fMRI), and microstructural (multi-shell HARDI) imaging. Specific Aim 2 will focus on a
genomic characterization of the affected child and biological parents ( a trio) using a standard protocol of
acquisition from subjects’ cheek swab to whole genome sequencing (WGS) with standard coverage, (99%) &
depth (30x). Output will be standardized file formats to include VCF, FASTQ and BAM files and transferred to
FaceBase for preliminary variant analysis. Aim 3 will focus on HIPPA compliant data transfer to Facebase of
neuroimaging and genomic information data of babies with all types of infants with craniosynostosis. It will also
codify and publicize the data acquisition protocols and quality standards as a pre-requisite for contribution to
HuCA. A new web landing page for HuCA will be built allowing permitted researchers to access the data in an
intuitive and interactive way, filterable by metadata. The synergy of CT, MRI and genomic data will enable
Facebase to house and share an unprecedented complement of multi-dimensional information about
craniosynostosis that can improve fundamental knowledge and classification of disease. A clear pathway and
protocol for data contribution and sharing will enable the large- sample size study needed for both conventional
and AI/ML/DL analysis. When a clinician is newly faced with a baby with craniosynostosis, they will benefit
from a vastly improved understanding of the condition at baseline and thus may be able to better predict and
optimize outcomes given a particular treatment."
11060617,"Since its inception in 1990, the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at New York University Langone
Health has facilitated pioneering research to define transitions from normal aging to the subjective cognitive
decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and early dementia stages of AD; as well as AD biomarker
development. Here we propose to continue this long-standing successful research direction with a focus on
understanding disease heterogeneity and delineating biomarkers and their role in these transitions, with
the long-term goal of helping to develop novel interventions that will delay or prevent cognitive decline.
The NYU ADRC has built an infrastructure that supports innovative research on AD and related dementias
(ADRD) to help achieve the NAPA goal of a cure by 2025. This will be facilitated by our nine highly successful
and interactive Cores (Admin; Clinical; Data Management & Statistical [DMS]; Neuropathology; Outreach,
Education & Engagement [ORE]; Neuroimaging; Biomarker; Psychosocial; and Research Education Component
[REC]). Together, our highly integrated cores will achieve the following aims: Aim 1. Enhance the performance
of innovative research in ADRC by maintaining nine cores that focus on delineating biomarkers of the transitions
from normal aging to SCD, MCI, and early dementia, and determining their roles to help develop novel
interventions that delay or prevent these transitions. We will also facilitate training in this area. Aim 2. Contribute
to the national network of ADRCs by providing clinical data, autopsy diagnoses, neuroimaging and biosamples
to NACC and NCRAD, as well as to other research community collaborative efforts in ADRD. Aim 3. Recruit and
retain a diverse subject population from clinical and community settings, via the ORE and Psychosocial Cores,
with concomitant engagement of the local scientific and lay community in ADRD with seminars, poster sessions
and the developmental projects via the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. Aim 4. Foster the development of novel
avenues of investigation with methodological developments by the cores (via innovative cognitive assessments,
neuroimaging techniques, biomarkers and proteomic approaches), and encourage, recruit, and select
developmental projects. Aim 5. Accelerate translational research across the ADRD spectrum by using
biomarkers to better define the underlying disease heterogeneity and foster the development of novel therapeutic
interventions that consider this heterogeneity. Aim 6. Facilitate the education and training of a diverse ADRD
workforce. Our Center will enhance the scientific community's understanding of ADRD and expand the next
generation of diverse ADRD scientists, via combined efforts of the Admin, ORE, and REC Cores. In summary,
the NYU ADRD has facilitated pioneering research that defined the stage transitions from normal aging to
dementia, and contributed to AD biomarker development from its inception. In the next five years of funding, this
focus will be expanded by: 1) improving our understanding of disease heterogeneity; 2) identifying new biomarkers
that will allow early detection; and 3) fostering research that will develop effective therapeutic interventions."

The Tobacco Online Policy Seminar (TOPS) series has established itself as a leading venue for disseminating
policy-relevant tobacco research, having hosted over 80 events in its three-year history. TOPS is a free,
multidisciplinary, biweekly Zoom-based seminar series for research with tobacco policy implications using
experimental or quasi-experimental study designs (i.e., with a well-defined counterfactual). This forum is
designed to bring together academics, students, government employees, policy researchers, healthcare
professionals, advocates, and funders, with the goal of breaking silos in tobacco policy research and providing
a platform for high-quality research to be discussed and disseminated. The ultimate goal of the forum is to
facilitate the production and sharing of knowledge to develop an effective tobacco policy framework for
improving population health. TOPS strives to be a respectful, inclusive, and diverse forum, with participants
and attendees united around the concept of presenting and learning from tobacco research using study
designs capable of producing results with a causal interpretation. TOPS is managed by an Executive Board of
four tobacco control researchers: Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, Michael Darden, Michael Pesko, and Ce Shang.
TOPS is supported by an advisory board of 37 experts in tobacco control research. Since submitting our last
R13 application (Oct. 2022), TOPS has averaged 175 participants per seminar. The aims of this conference
grant application are to: 1) continue TOPS and ensure that the series continues to showcase high-quality
tobacco regulatory and policy-relevant research; and 2) continue existing and introduce new career
development opportunities. To meet these aims, the TOPS Executive Board will meet regularly throughout the
year to continue planning and hosting TOPS seminars. The conference grant will also support the effort of a
part-time administrator to oversee day-to-day activities of TOPS."

11058774,"Project Summary / Abstract
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly in
LMICs. Home BP monitoring is an emerging strategy to promote frequent monitoring of BPs, however unique
challenges exist in LMICs. Given widespread smartphone use in urban Ghana, we will leverage accessible
technology, adapted to the Ghanaian setting, to overcome barriers to home BP monitoring.
Aim 1 (R21) will adapt a home BP monitoring smartphone app to the Ghanaian context, using the ADAPT-ITT
framework. Stakeholder focus groups and cognitive interviews will be held with Ghanaian pregnant women,
midwives, and Obstetrician/Gynecologists to iteratively adapt the smartphone app, with a focus on cultural
relevance, locally appropriate language and phrasing, and useability in low literacy and numeracy populations.
Aim 2 (R21) will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of a smartphone app-enhanced home BP
monitoring intervention among pregnant patients in Ghana. We will engage 100 pregnant participants over 4
weeks of home BP monitoring using the refined smartphone app, and complete pre-and-post validated scales
of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. Fidelity will be evaluated by examining stored values in the BP
monitor and smartphone app to determine if concerning combinations of elevated BPs and preeclampsia
symptoms correctly trigger clinical alerts. Aim 3 (R33) will measure the adherence to BP monitoring with a
smartphone app-enhanced home BP monitoring intervention among pregnant patients in Ghana. We will
engage a prospective cohort of 200 pregnant participants in home BP monitoring from enrollment through
delivery. Adherence to BP monitoring will be measured both as frequency and time to drop-off of monitoring
over the course of pregnancy. Aim 4 (R33) will evaluate the clinical response to elevated BPs with a
smartphone app-enhanced home BP monitoring intervention among pregnant patients in Ghana. Automatic
alerts, triggered by BPs and symptoms, will be sent to study nurses trained on clinical response protocols.
Timely clinical response (routine alert: <4 hours; urgent alert: <1 hour) will be evaluated by comparing times of
a recorded elevated BP to the outgoing phone call by the nurse and successful contact with the participant.
Appropriateness of clinical response will be assessed using an expert consensus approach. Outcome of
clinical response will be evaluated by the proportion of participants who adhere with clinical advice provided by
the study nurse.
Smartphone app-enabled home BP monitoring is a novel strategy to address challenges in managing HDP.
Implementing home BP monitoring in LMICs will provide a critical step toward frequent assessment of BPs,
earlier diagnosis of HDP, and prevention of serious maternal morbidity and mortality."
11055510,"SUMMARY
Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the
way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and
dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual
neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers
of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically
rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with
movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research
program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data.
The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing
rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with
psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities,
but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To
provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to
characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these
interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for
analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables,
including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural
information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of
the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast
timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential
mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes
normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can
accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate
relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural
signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is
common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to
handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns
development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional
continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike
trains)."

 People with serious mental illness (SMI) experience dramatically worse health and longevity than the
general population, which is exacerbated by extremely high rates of loneliness and social isolation. Both social
isolation (lack of social supports) and loneliness (the subjective experience of isolation) are highly predictive of
early mortality. Although social isolation and loneliness are inherently relational, influenced by contextual
factors, and prevalent among people with SMI, very little is known about how to design community mental
health environments that foster social connection (“social architecture”). Thus, the goal of this K01 is to lay the
foundation for an innovative, impactful research career focused on reducing social isolation among people with
SMI through environmental design. My research plan employs a rigorous, mixed-method design to: 1) identify
environmental features associated with two behavioral mechanisms of action: activity engagement and social
interaction; 2) examine associations between activity engagement, social interaction, and self-reported
loneliness and support; and 3) feasibility test the co-design and implementation of an environmental
modification to support social connection. To do this, I will first conduct socio-spatial observations of activity
engagement and social interaction in four mental health Clubhouses in Hawaii. These are community-based
psychosocial rehabilitation centers that are highly interested in reducing loneliness among their members.
Observation data will be paired with survey data (N=150) to examine associations between observed activity
engagement and social interaction and self-reported loneliness and social support. Second, spatial
observations and social network data will be visualized to refine a conceptual model interlinking engagement
and social interaction. These visualizations will be shared with participating Clubhouses to contextualize the
identified patterns in engagement and social interaction and to co-identify potentially modifiable environmental
features associated with them. Third, an environmental intervention co-design process will be conducted in one
Clubhouse and the intervention will be implemented. Feasibility data on the co-design process and
modification of the environmental intervention protocol will be collected through field notes and a final focus
group and subsequently analyzed qualitatively. This research will be carried out with close mentorship from a
team of highly accomplished senior scholars: Drs. Henwood, Wenzel, Salzer, Valente, Wilson, and Stark. Their
work is directly aligned with my career and training goals, which focus on three intersecting areas of expertise:
1) socio-spatial methods (GIS, social network analysis and ecological momentary assessment), 2) theory
linking environmental design, human behaviors, and health, and 3) environmental intervention co-design based
on community-based participatory research principles. This K01 builds on my unique clinical and theoretical
background as an occupational therapist and community psychologist and lays the foundation for an
innovative, highly impactful career focused on reducing social isolation and loneliness among people with SMI."
11059576,"Project Summary
The cardiac action potential is primarily generated by sodium and calcium channels, which depolarize the
membrane potential, and by potassium channels that repolarize the membrane potential and terminate the
action potential. One of the major cardiac potassium currents is the slowly activating potassium current IKs that
contribute to the action potential termination. Over 300 different inherited mutations have been found in IKs
channels that cause cardiac arrhythmias in patients. IKs channels regulate the length of the cardiac contraction
and mutations that decreases the activity of IKs channels result in a prolongation of the cardiac contraction,
leading to Long QT Syndrome. In turn, Long QT syndrome is a risk factor for ventricular fibrillation and sudden
cardiac death. We have identified a family of compounds that activate IKs channels and are antiarrhythmic
when applied to cardiomyocytes. We will here test whether these compounds restores the length of the action
potential in human cardiomyocytes from Long QT Syndrome patients. We will also test the effect of these
compounds on in ex vivo animal hearts and in vivo in transgenic animals with Long QT Syndrome mutations, in
order to develop drug that restores the QT interval and that can be tested in future clinical trial. We will also
test variants of these compounds on heterologously expressed IKs channels using two-electrode voltage clamp,
to determine the important structure of these compounds for their effects on IKs channels. We will also make
mutations of IKs channels to determine the binding site of these compounds. Finally, we will test the efficacy of
these compounds to reverse different defects in IKs channels caused by different types of Long QT syndrome
mutations. This will be tested both in heterologous systems and in human cardiomyocytes. The anticipated
results of these experiments will provide proof-of-concept that this family of compounds can shorten the
cardiac action potential and prevent cardiac arrhythmia, and will provide preliminary animal model data to start
clinical trials of these compounds. We anticipate that this development of new anti-arrhythmic drugs will lead to
better treatments of cardiac arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac deaths in LQTS patients."
11059589,"Conventional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs are highly effective and the standard of care in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PR faces two significant problems: (1) most
patients with COPD who would benefit from PR cannot access it, and 2) there is no effective long-term strategy
to maintain physical activity (PA) and benefits after completing PR. We propose a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to test the efficacy of a technology-mediated intervention to increase PA in persons with COPD who
cannot access conventional, hospital-based PR. We also propose a non-randomized study to explore the ability
of the PA intervention to maintain PA and exercise adherence, extending the benefits of PR, in persons with
COPD who complete a conventional PR program. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United
States; an estimated 16 million Americans have COPD. Despite maximal medical therapy, patients with COPD
characteristically experience breathlessness, which leads to a downward spiral of sedentary behavior, physical
inactivity, deconditioning, and functional disability. Low physical activity is associated with poor outcomes in
COPD--increased risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalizations, and death, independent of lung function. The
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend regular PA for all
patients with COPD. Conventional, supervised PR programs clearly reduce breathlessness, and improve
health-related quality of life (HRQL) and exercise capacity. However, PR programs face significant challenges
of access and adherence. We developed Every Step Counts (ESC), a technology-mediated intervention
based on the Behavioral Theory of Self-Regulation, to target sedentary behavior, promote PA, and alleviate
deconditioning. ESC couples a website with a pedometer to directly monitor step counts. The website
provides individualized step-count goals, iterative feedback, education on disease self-management,
motivation, and an online community of social support. In two randomized studies in Veterans with COPD, we
demonstrated ESC's safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA. Accessible via the internet and available
at any time from home, ESC could be an ideal low-cost platform to address the limitations of conventional PR.
We hypothesize that ESC may be an efficacious strategy to promote PA in the many patients who cannot
attend a PR program, and may be an option to maintain engagement in PA after patients complete a
conventional PR program. Primary Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of a web-based intervention, ESC, to
increase PA (measured directly with an accelerometer and a questionnaire that assesses intensity), compared
to usual care, in persons with COPD who are referred to conventional PR but who cannot access it.
Secondary Aim 2: Estimate the effect of the ESC intervention on (a) exercise adherence, (b) exercise self-
efficacy, (c) HRQL, (d) dyspnea, (e) anxiety and depression, (f) exercise capacity, and (g) risk of acute
exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations, compared to usual care. Exploratory Aim 3: Assess the
ability of ESC to maintain PA and exercise adherence, and extend the benefits of PR, in participants with
COPD who have completed conventional PR."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is characterized by intense liver inflammation and injury in the setting of excess alcohol
ingestion. Cytokine and chemokine upregulation leads to immune cell infiltration and drives inflammation in AH.
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) are an important source of chemokine expression in the liver and
participate in paracrine signaling to attract immune cells in a process termed “angiocrine signaling”. Pathway
analysis of AH liver RNA-sequencing suggests a potential role of IL17 in mediating LSEC angiocrine signaling.
IL17 is a cytokine involved in many autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Our preliminary data shows that
IL17 synergically stimulates CXCL chemokine production with TNFα, but the underlying mechanism is not clear.
The regulation of IL17 production from T cells also requires further study. To test our hypothesis, we will employ
complementary cell biologic and in vivo approaches to study the following specific aims: Aim 1. LSECs enhance
CXCL1-dependent neutrophil transendothelial migration in response to IL17; Aim 2. Therapeutic
targeting of a super enhancer in T cells downregulates IL17 and ameliorates inflammation in AH.
This supplement will provide additional support for personnel hiring and training to further the work proposed in
Aim 1 during my upcoming leave of absence. In Aim 1, we explored the role of IκB𝜁𝜁, a transcription factor
previously implicated in IL17 signaling, in mediating the interaction between IL17 and TNFα signaling pathways.
We are planning to generate LSEC-specific IκB𝜁𝜁 KO mice and test the effect of IκB𝜁𝜁 deletion in AH model. In
addition, we will use an anti-IL17 antibody to observe the effect of IL17 axis inhibition in AH model. We plan to
isolate LSECs from control and treated mice and submit these samples for bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. Better
understanding of the IL17 mediated angiocrine signaling process may reveal novel therapeutic targets for
treatment of AH. Therefore, our overall aims and approaches are aligned with the mission of NIAAA to further
understanding and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases."
11060283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) affects an estimated 17% of adolescents worldwide. Earlier onset in
adolescence is linked to more severe trajectories of NSSI, suicide plans, and poorer quality of life. Though
early intervention for NSSI is critical, most adolescents with NSSI do not seek professional help, and many do
not self-disclose their behaviors to anyone in person, limiting access to support and preventing pathways to
treatment. While several psychological interventions have been effective in reducing adolescent NSSI,
structural barriers (e.g., time, cost), attitudinal barriers (e.g., stigma, mental health literacy), and the prevalence
of non-disclosure constrain their accessibility and reach. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) present an
opportunity to reach this high-risk and non-treatment-engaged population and increase their access to
evidence-based psychological strategies. Indeed, adolescents report receptivity to digital interventions and
engage in NSSI help-seeking online at high rates. However, to date there are no publicly available DMHIs
designed to support this adolescent population. In collaboration with Mental Health America (MHA), the
nation’s largest mental health advocacy organization, the proposed K01 application will address this gap by
designing and evaluating a DMHI attuned to the unique needs and preferences of adolescents (14-17 years)
who engage in NSSI. This project will leverage a moment of online information-seeking through MHA’s
website, to deliver a low-intensity DMHI focused on acquisition and practice of evidence-based skills to
improve self-regulation and deliver help-seeking information, to ultimately reduce NSSI frequency and
encourage future treatment engagement. Partnering with MHA to deliver the DMHI provides a clear
dissemination pathway and access to a diverse group of adolescents who are not in treatment. To design the
DMHI, I will employ user-centered design activities, which involve key stakeholders in the research and design
process to ensure adolescents’ needs and preferences are reflected in the final DMHI. I will also engage MHA
stakeholders in the development of a strategic implementation and dissemination plan through their website. I
will then pilot a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the DMHI with 80 adolescents (14-17 years of age)
randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive the DMHI (n=40) or an active psychoeducational control (n=40) for the
duration of 8 weeks. This K01 will be a critical first step in positioning me to achieve my career goal and
become a leading independent researcher in digital mental health. My four training aims are designed to
support this overarching goal by extending my expertise in: 1) UCD and summative methods including usability
testing for DMHIs and support further development of expertise in 2) the conduct of clinical trials, 3) scalable
implementation methodologies, and 4) treatment models for adolescent NSSI. Accomplishment of these
training goals and the proposed research project will provide the skills necessary for the development of an
R01 of a fully powered hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial testing the efficacy of the DMHI."
10932408,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Uterine vascular remodeling occurs during gestation to meet increasing fetal nutrient demands. This 
remodeling includes modification of the uterine spiral arteries into low resistance vessels for supplying blood to 
the fetus. Central to uterine spiral artery remodeling are invasive trophoblast cells, known in the human as 
extravillous trophoblast (EVT). Impaired EVT development leads to suboptimal fetal conditions and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm birth. 
We identified a critical and conserved regulator of EVT lineage development, Achaete-Scute Family Basic 
Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor 2 (ASCL2). Depletion of ASCL2 in human trophoblast stem (hTS) cells
inhibits EVT formation. Similarly, global depletion of ASCL2 in vivo disrupts placental development and causes 
embryonic lethality in the rat. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ASCL2 directs EVT lineage 
development are unknown. Our established hTS cell lines and protocols for generating mutant rat models will 
allow us to directly test our central hypothesis that ASCL2 controls EVT lineage development during 
placentation. To investigate higher order actions of ASCL2 on the epigenomic landscape of the EVT cell 
lineage, we will identify how ASCL2 depletion alters DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and 
conformation using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin-sequencing (ATAC-seq), and chromatin capture using Hi-C, respectively (Aim 1A). To identify direct genomic 
targets of ASCL2 we will perform chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in EVT cells (Aim 
1B). ASCL2 regulation of trophoblast development and invasion will then be evaluated in vivo using a newly 
established model of invasive trophoblast cell specific depletion based on breeding Prl7b1 Cre recombinase 
and Ascl2 floxed rats (Aim 2A). To examine ASCL2-positive trophoblast cell development in normal and 
diseased rat placentas we will conduct single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell ATAC-seq 
(Aim 2B). The proposed research plan will provide the candidate with a body of experimental work necessary
for independent publications and preliminary data for R-series grants. During the R00 phase the candidate will 
develop independence from her mentors by identifying targets of ASCL2 and investigating their contributions to 
invasive trophoblast lineage development with innovative rat models. The proposed research project serves as 
the foundation for the candidate’s long-term career goal of identifying how dysregulated spiral artery 
remodeling leads to a spectrum of diseases ranging from fetal growth restriction to preeclampsia."

Intraoperative consultations (IOC, often refers to frozen-section histopathology during surgery) significantly
improve the outcome of many oncological surgeries. However, even though this procedure generates results
much faster than traditional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) histopathology, it is still lengthy for time-
sensitive surgeries such as head and neck tumor resections. Surgeries often need to be paused during the IOC,
leading to an expensive waste of operating room time and resources. Because IOC usually requires a fast
turnaround, only a few slices can be prepared and evaluated at a time. Miscommunication between surgeons
and pathologists leads to sampling errors. Freezing artifacts result in degraded histology quality. These
limitations increase the risk of missing important histopathology information in the slice, resulting in false-
negative margins which affects the success rate and long-term outcomes of cancer surgeries. Thus, there is a
need for faster and more reliable intraoperative histopathology evaluation. To address these limitations, we
propose to develop an alternative histology framework for intraoperative histopathology assessment using a
combination of optical clearing and 3D imaging technologies developed in our lab. Our proposed product will
provide 3D histology information of intraoperative specimens with a faster and simpler workflow than the
incumbent solution. The product comprises three major components: 1) a rapid tissue processing pipeline that
makes tissue transparent with a few washes, 2) a user-friendly imaging system that enables real-time 3D
microscopy imaging of the transparent whole-mount clinical specimens, 3) A software user interface that
translates the 3D data into 2D images with pathologist-familiar color contrast and assists the pathologist in
interpreting the data. 3D virtual histology has been proposed as an alternative to slice-based histopathology to
provide more accurate diagnoses. However, current 3D virtual histopathology techniques often have high
complexity and long turnaround time. Our preliminary customer discovery suggested it was highly challenging
for histology labs to incorporate these new techniques into the existing well-established workflow due to high
capital cost and complexity. By simplifying the sample preparation into 2-3 fluid washes and providing a plug-
and-play 3D imaging device that requires minimal calibration and maintenance, our product will enable 3D virtual
histopathology that is easier, faster, and more accurate than the traditional methods."

Telephone-based cognition testing lends itself more easily to a broader range of populations than in-person
face-to-face testing, is cost-effective, and because it places a lower burden on study participants, reduces
attrition in longitudinal studies. However, scores obtained from phone-based testing are not directly
comparable to scores obtained from the more traditional face-to-face testing, and some studies have found
systematic differences (offsets) in test scores by mode of administration, with tests of memory and of attention
being particularly susceptible to mode effects. Comparability across modes of test administration is critical for
interpreting scores in research studies obtained using more than one mode of testing across the study sample,
as well as for interpreting longitudinal, within-person change in cognition, in both clinical and research settings,
when the mode of administration switches between visits. Furthermore, whether the comparability of phone-
based scores to scores from face-to-face testing varies across demographic groups and by level of cognition,
is an open question. Some studies suggest that mode effects vary by age and presence of cognitive
impairment. Answers to these questions are critical to longitudinal studies like the SWAN Aging study, which
have tracked cognitive performance serially. In the recently completed SWAN Aging 17th follow up visit,
cognition test batteries were administered both over the telephone and in-person at the study clinic. For
reasons relating to the COVID pandemic and the older ages of participants, nearly one in four V17 participants
chose to complete the cognition testing from home over the telephone. The primary objective of this
administrative supplement to the SWAN Aging U19 is to conduct a cross-calibration study in a new sample of
women, of similar age as V17 participants (age range, 66-76 years) to create test-score adjustment/correction
formulas that incorporate differences by level of cognitive functioning. Our specific aims are to, in a new
calibration sample of 100 women, ages 66-76 years, from across the education spectrum, to administer in
participants' primary languages (English, Spanish, Cantonese, and Japanese) the SWAN V17 phone and in-
person cognition batteries 2-4 weeks apart, in randomized order, and 1) determine between-mode differences
and correlations for individual tests of episodic memory, working memory, fluency, and attention; 2) determine
if race/ethnicity, language of testing, and cognition level modify mode differences; and 3) create calibration
equations to enhance the comparability of scores obtained via telephone testing and face-to-face testing."

Exposure to household air pollution from the use of traditional energy sources is a top-ten risk factor for morbidity
and mortality worldwide. Emissions from traditional energy sources in the home create unhealthy levels of
household air pollution and the issue is pervasive. Approximately 3 billion people rely on fuels like wood,
charcoal, and kerosene to support needs such as cooking, heating, and lighting. Approximately 80% of the
population in Rwanda uses such fuels, making exposure to household air pollution the 3rd leading contributor to
the burden of disease in this country. Exposure to household air pollution is also a problem in the developed
world. Nearly 30 million Americans burn solid fuels as their primary source of heating energy.
Nearly 50 years of research on ‘cleaner’ household energy technologies has demonstrated only modest global
impact, due to a combination of economic, cultural, and technologic barriers that prevent access to and usage
of clean energy. A further limitation is that nearly all household energy interventions, to date, have focused on
replacing only a single energy source (i.e., replacing just cooking, or just lighting) with a more modern technology.
We propose to address these issues by conducting a randomized controlled trial that (1) focuses on total
household energy (2) in a country that evinces readiness for alternative forms of energy, (3) by forming a public-
private partnership to promote technological solutions that are consumer-focused and market sustainable, (4)
by investigating outcome measures that are clinically actionable and strongly linked to morbidity/mortality, and
(5) by developing project outputs that can inform policymakers with cost-benefit information. We hypothesize
that a whole-house energy intervention (replacing all primitive forms of energy within the home with cleaner,
modern forms) will produce meaningful reductions in household air pollution and health benefits in rural Rwandan
homes. The randomized controlled trial will substitute traditional forms of household energy (biomass for cooking
and kerosene for lighting) with solar power and liquefied petroleum gas stoves in rural Rwanda. Participants will
be followed for 3 years with repeated measurements of household air pollution exposure (24-hour fine particulate
matter and black carbon), energy usage, and health. Primary health endpoints will include blood pressure in
adult women and men and lung-function growth in children; secondary health endpoints include blood pressure
in children and lung-function change in adults.
The long-term goals of this research are to increase the clinical knowledge-base on the health effects on
household air pollution, to demonstrate that a whole-house energy intervention will produce meaningful
household air pollution reductions and health benefits in rural Rwandan homes, to elucidate the relationship
between fuel subsidy levels and household air pollution exposure, and to demonstrate that scalable solutions to
the household air pollution disease burden are achievable via public-private-governmental partnerships."

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic is arguably one of the most devastating
Public Health crises of the last century. In the United States, African-Americans have been disproportionately
impacted, with overall rates of infection and mortality 2 to 4 times higher than those observed in Whites.
Additionally, as a direct result of closings of non-essential businesses and other entities, rates of
unemployment and underemployment have also surged, and African-Americans are significantly more likely
than Whites to report being underemployed or furloughed due to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, given racial
disparities in COVID-19 mortality, national polls have also found racial differences in reports of COVID-related
loss, with African-Americans more frequently reporting personally knowing someone who has died from
COVID-19 than Whites. Because of this, it has been argued that, as a result of COVID-19, African-
Americans are experiencing a “pandemic of stress” that will have a “dangerous impact” on their health
and well-being long after the virus itself has been contained. Leveraging our previously funded cohort that
assessed psychosocial stress and vascular aging in early middle-aged African-American women, we have an
unprecedented opportunity to examine the degree to which stressors resulting from, and related to,
the COVID-19 pandemic might impact vascular disease—the number 1 killer in the US-in this group.
Middle-aged African-American women may be a uniquely important group on which to focus, because: 1) they
have increasingly high, but poorly understood, rates of vascular disease relative to other race-gender groups;
and 2) the long-term impact of the widespread financial, employment and social stressors resulting from
COVID-19 might be particularly deleterious for African-American women, largely due to structural and
contextual inequalities that pre-dated the pandemic itself. The proposed project will examine linkages between
overall psychosocial stressors (debt, financial stress, job stress, interpersonal incivilities and mistreatment,
loneliness), COVID-specific stressors (COVID-related financial difficulties, COVID-specific parenting stressors,
COVID-related loss) and prospective changes in vascular aging (ambulatory blood pressure, arterial stiffness,
inflammation) over 24 months in a cohort of 350 middle-aged African-American women. Because we have
pre-COVID assessments of a range of psychosocial stressors, a major innovation of the proposed work is
our ability to examine how pre- versus post-COVID changes in exposure to overall psychosocial stress
might prospectively impact vascular aging. Importantly, we will capitalize on the considerable within-group
heterogeneity in our cohort, to examine whether any of our hypothesized associations are moderated by pre-
COVID assessed sociodemographic factors that might increase vulnerability (socioeconomic status, single
parenthood, marital status) or resilience (e.g., purpose in life, optimism, mastery, social support) to
psychosocial stress, in order to inform short- and long-term prevention efforts."
11061551,"PARENT GRANT – ABSTRACT (as per original submission)
The overarching goal of our laboratory is to determine how DNA damage response inhibitors (DDRi) can be used
to potentiate cancer cell killing while concurrently increasing anti-tumor immune responses after radiation therapy
(XRT). The DNA Damage Response (DDR) is a signaling system that integrates DNA repair pathways and the
cell cycle to safeguard genome stability. In addition to activating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair in cells
treated with XRT, the DDR limits origin firing and delays cell cycle transitions in unstressed cells. While cyclin-
dependent kinases are cell cycle accelerators, DDR kinases are cell cycle brakes and, in this analogy, DDRi
disable the brakes, causing unchecked acceleration. Here we will determine how the DDR is rewired in CD8+ T
cells to accommodate massive and concomitant DNA replication and transcription in S phase. We will also
determine the impact of DDRi in cancer and immune cells. We hypothesize that ATR kinase inhibitors induce
origin firing that causes ribonucleosides to be mis-incorporated into the genome, and that this generates
chimeric RNA-DNA fragments and type I IFN-dependent immunologic memory after XRT. To test our
hypothesis in cancer and immune cells, we have generated an innovative transplantable model of cancer. The
Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 mouse carries a mutation in Mcm4 that destabilizes the replicative helicase. Cells derived
from Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 mice have a 60% reduction in origin licensing. We have generated
Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3 B16 cancer cells that can be transplanted into Mcm4wt/wt and Mcm4Chaos3/Chaos3
mice. This will allow us to separate the function of ATR that limits origin firing from that which mediates the repair
of replication forks in cancer and immune cells. In Aim 1, we will define cell cycle kinetics and determine how
ATR inhibitors induce DNA damage in immune and cancer cells in vitro. In Aim 2, we will define cell cycle kinetics
and determine whether ATR inhibitors induce DNA damage in immune cells and type 1 interferons in vivo. In Aim
3, we will determine whether ATR inhibitors combine with XRT to generate durable responses and immunologic
memory through effects on immune and/or cancer cells. Successful completion of this project will define how the
DDR is rewired in CD8+ T cells to accelerate cell cycle transitions and accommodate massive and concomitant
DNA replication and transcription in S phase which, accounts for ~70% of the cell cycle as G1 is abridged. These
studies are highly significant as the objective of checkpoint blockade and adoptive T cell transfer is to induce
rapid division in CD8+ T cells. Successful completion of this project will identify combinations and sequences of
DDRi that potentiate cancer cell killing while concurrently increasing anti-tumor immune responses in mouse
models of cancer treated with XRT. These studies are highly significant as we use DDRi that are currently in 115
clinical trials and XRT which is used to treat >50% of cancer patients, >60% with curative intent.
R01 Diversity Supplement
The goals of the current proposed research plan integrate with Aim 3 of the parent R01. The goal of the diversity
supplement is to determine the role of ATR signaling in T cell memory development. Previous findings in knockout
mouse models suggest that upstream and downstream signaling, by ETAA1 and DCK respectively, of ATR is
necessary for memory development. In addition, previous laboratory findings have shown that use of ATRi will
radiotherapy modulates the immunologic memory. Short-term ATRi treatments were found to potentiate memory
responses, while long-term use of this drug blunted immune memory development when combined with
radiotherapy. We hypothesize that ETAA1-dependent, ATR phosphorylation of DCK is essential for T cell
memory development and that ATRi can be used to potentiate memory. We will complete three aims in
order to determine this. Aim 1 will Determine whether ETAA1-ATR signaling is an intrinsic regulator of T cell
activation that impacts the development of T cell memory. Aim 2 will Determine whether DCK is an intrinsic
regulator of T cell activation that impacts the development of T cell memory. Aim 3 will Determine whether ETAA1-
ATR-DCK signaling is necessary for immunological memory responses to occur upon rechallenge. Successful
completion of these Aims will determine whether ETAA1-ATR-DCK activity in CD8+ T cells promotes memory
and whether this signaling axis can be targeted with pharmacologics to mitigate autoimmune diseases and
potentiate immune responses to infection and cancer. Successful completion of this proposal will directly prove
whether ATRi can potentiate the acquisition of immunologic memory and identify the optimal schedule of ATRi +
IR for clinical trials."

The chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin is a first-line drug for the treatment of many solid tumors, especially head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, resistance to cisplatin has become a major obstacle to
effective cancer therapy. Cisplatin is well-known to enrich the cancer stem cell (CSC) population, which can
contribute to chemoresistance. Accordingly, targeting CSCs may represent an effective strategy to overcome
cisplatin resistance. Previously, we demonstrated that FOSL1 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis of
HNSCC through establishing Super-Enhancers (SEs) at key cancer stemness and pro-metastatic genes, and
furthermore, disruption of FOSL1-SEs suppresses HNSCC growth and metastasis. Additionally, we have
discovered that increased FOSL1 activity facilitates cisplatin resistance of CSCs in a spontaneous mouse model
of HNSCC. Taken together, we believe that the FOSL1-SE-dependent transcription program may represent a
novel target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in HNSCC. To validate this, the key scientific questions of
whether FOSL1-SEs are present in cisplatin-enriched CSCs and how to determine their functional properties
must be addressed, as these FOSL1-SEs were originally characterized using whole HNSCC cell populations
only. Currently, no effective FOSL1 inhibitors are available, which hinders our further mechanistic and functional
studies. Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) is a novel approach to selectively and potently degrade a
protein of interest (POI) both in vitro and in vivo. In this approach, a hetero-functional molecule is designed to
contain an inhibitor that binds to a POI, another small-molecule ligand which binds to an E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex, and a linker to tether these two ligands together. In our preliminary studies, we have designed and
synthesized a group of novel PROTAC-based FOSL1 degraders, from a parental FOSL1 inhibitor. The top
compound can potently degrade FOSL1 to eliminate CSCs in vivo, displaying advantages over the parent
inhibitor. Therefore, we hypothesize that FOSL1-SEs determine the functional properties of cisplatin-enriched
CSCs in HNSCC, and serve as a promising target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in HNSCC, which can be
validated by utilizing the effective PROTAC-based FOSL1 degraders. We propose the following specific aims to
test our hypotheses. Aim 1: Investigate the mechanism of action of FOSL1-SEs in determining the functional
properties of cisplatin-enriched CSCs in HNSCC and apply PROTACs to validate such a mechanism of action.
Aim 2: Initiate SAR studies and a functional screening to identify the top PROTACs to target FOSL1-SEs
effectively in HNSCC from a library of 100 candidates. The goal is to identify optimal compounds for mechanistic
(Aim 1) and functional validations (Aim 3). Aim 3: Validate whether targeting FOSL1-SEs with PROTAC
molecules (top 2 compounds from Aim 2) can efficiently eliminate CSCs and overcome cisplatin resistance
using mouse models of HNSCC. The successful completion of this study will provide a novel and validated
drug target and contribute to the development of new strategies for improving HNSCC chemotherapy outcome."

Project Summary
The Human Tissue and Organ Research Resource (HTORR) is a division of the National Disease Research
Interchange (NDRI), a not-for-profit NIH-funded organization whose mission is to provide the biomedical
research community with human tissues for research. The requirements for human biospecimens continue to
evolve in tandem with complexity of scientific questions and experimental methodologies that investigators desire
to pursue. To meet this requirement, HTORR utilizes a project-specific approach and a diverse network of tissue
source sites (TSS) to provide investigators with the opportunity to obtain a broad range of normal and diseased
human biospecimens for their studies. HTORR’s expertise involves a five-pronged approach to creating a
reliable research resource to meet this emergent need for investigators. HTORR provides: 1) expert customer
service and 24/7 support for investigators, 2) a solution-oriented approach for investigators via the opportunity
to develop project-specific protocols for each project, 3) access to diverse range of human biospecimens from
all body systems, 4) ongoing outreach efforts via multiple platforms to increase awareness of the resource, and
5) industry best practices and standards regarding the donation of human tissue for research. Implementation
of this plan will ensure uninterrupted service of high quality, well annotated normal and diseased human
biospecimens to investigators from an established network of tissue source sites, in concert with the
development and implementation of innovative, large scale initiatives for the biomedical research community.

11054459,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit significant clinical
overlap, but the shared and distinct biology of these conditions remains incompletely understood. Both ASD and
ADHD have been linked in part to the brain’s reward system, with prior work demonstrating that these conditions
are associated with altered function and structure of individual reward structures. However, reward areas do not
act in isolation but instead communicate extensively with many higher- and lower-order brain regions, including
sensorimotor and cognitive control areas implicated in ASD and ADHD, respectively. To inform our
understanding of the convergent and divergent neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, there is thus a
crucial need to understand how the connectivity patterns of reward structures are altered in these conditions.
The proposed project will use cutting-edge resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI)
methods together with refined machine learning and statistical modeling approaches to investigate reward
functional connectivity in ASD and ADHD. Analyses will consider both categorical diagnoses (ASD, ADHD,
comorbid ASD+ADHD, neurotypical controls) and continuous ASD and ADHD symptoms across the population.
Datasets will include the largest available samples in the world for both categorical diagnoses (N>6,000; ages
5-65) and continuous symptoms (N>11,000; ages 9-14). The aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1 will
investigate the functional connectivity patterns of reward regions in ASD and ADHD using machine learning and
multivariate statistical approaches. Aim 2 will assess the moderating impact of key sources of heterogeneity
(sex, puberty, medication) on reward functional connectivity in ASD and ADHD using machine learning. Aim 3
will create normative reference curves of reward functional connectivity using data-driven modeling approaches
and examine deviations from typical maturational trajectories in ASD and ADHD. Taken together, this work will
substantially improve our understanding of reward circuitry in ASD and ADHD, as well as the shared and distinct
neural underpinnings of these conditions. In the long-term, this project will contribute to the development and
personalization of novel biologically-grounded treatments for ASD and ADHD. These studies are in line with the
NIMH strategic plan to define the brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors, and to examine mental
illness trajectories across the lifespan. Additionally, this proposal will provide the PI with significant training in the
following new areas: (1) refined machine learning methods, (2) advanced statistical modeling approaches, and
(3) cutting-edge functional connectivity methods. This training will be completed under the mentorship of Drs.
Paul Thompson, Jose-Luis Ambite and Vince Calhoun, who are world-renowned experts in their respective fields.
As a whole, the proposed research and training will allow the PI to become a productive independent investigator
using cutting-edge analytic methods to lead translational research on neurodevelopmental disorders and their
heterogeneity to improve precision medicine approaches."
11010928,"Fertilization is an essential biological process that involves cell surface recognition, adhesion, and fusion of
haploid sperm and egg to form a new, genetically distinct diploid organism. Surprisingly little is known
about how plasma membranes interact and fuse, largely due to the limited availability of mammalian
gametes and the technical challenges of capturing transient extracellular interactions. While the gamete
membrane fusion machinery remains elusive, it is known that a human immunoglobulin superfamily
protein, Izumo1, localizes to the equatorial segment of spermatozoon, where it interacts with an oocyte
ligand, Juno, before gamete fusion takes place. To date, Izumo1-Juno is the only essential receptor-ligand
pair identified in the pathway. Recent genetic studies in mice have identified additional sperm surface
proteins essential for male fertility, but their interactions and regulation have not been defined. To close
these major gaps, I have designed a research program around the central hypothesis that gamete surface
proteins orchestrate their structural rearrangements and membrane remodeling, leading to gamete fusion.
I will test my hypothesis by (1) determining the assembly mechanisms of sperm fertilization protein
IZUMO1, (2) characterizing the roles of sperm fertilization proteins in membrane adhesion and fusion, and
(3) identifying additional receptor-ligand interactions essential for fertilization. My multidisciplinary
approach leverages high-resolution structural analyses to interrogate the functional organization of known
essential gamete surface proteins, and harnesses high-throughput forward genetic screens to explore the
interacting networks of additional emerging molecules. I have extensive training in genetics, cell biology,
membrane biochemistry, protein engineering and structural biology. At Yale, my research laboartory aims
to understand the mammalian sperm-egg fusion process at the levels of cell biology, mechanistic
biochemistry, and structural biology. Crucially, understanding these processes will elucidate mechanisms
of cell-cell adhesion and fusion and reveal essential factors for human fertility and reproductive health."
11017278,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Few young children meet the recently adopted World Health Organization recommendations for movement 
behaviors (physical activity, sleep, and screen-time), known as the 24-Hour Movement Guidelines. This 
inadequate balance of movement behaviors places children at risk for more behavioral problems, poor cognitive 
development, delayed motor skills, and obesity. Minority children and children who live in low-income household 
are at increased risk of meeting few recommendations, and consequently these long-term health outcomes. 
Pitfalls of current literature include focusing on one behavior at a time and neglecting the context in which these 
behaviors occur. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and mHealth tools are ideally positioned to address 
this gap, by assessing and addressing movement behaviors in real-time and within the home, where all three 
movement behaviors occur. Using mixed methods, this study aims to identify patterns (amount and context) of 
child movement behaviors within the home via EMA paired with a child-worn accelerometer and identify barriers 
and facilitators to changing these behaviors within the home via semi-structured interviews (Research Aim 1). 
Behavior change theory, previous literature, and an iterative process using parent feedback will inform the design 
of a movement behavior intervention delivered through a mHealth modality (e.g., mobile app, Research Aim 2). 
Finally, this study will then pilot test the preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of this intervention in a 
randomized control trial with the goal of meeting all three movement behavior recommendations, thus the 24-
Hour Movement Guidelines (Research Aim 3). To complement these research aims, the candidate will receive 
didactic, hands-on, and applied research training in EMA, mHealth, and interventional research amongst diverse 
populations (Training Aim 1), along with behavior change theory and child behavior and cognitive development 
(Training Aim 2). The candidate will expand her network and presence, and scientific prowess in writing grants 
and mentoring to propel her into a future career as a 24-Hour Movement expert (Training Aim 3). Experts in 
these respective fields, who are also seasoned mentors, will guide her through these research and training aims, 
and ultimately into an independent position and research career. This experience will culminate in data for the 
candidate to build her independent research program, with the goal of improving child movement behaviors, and 
ultimately their long-term health."
11061622,"Project Summary/Abstract
In late 2019, the SARS-CoV2 virus emerged as a global pandemic, causing the severe respiratory disease
COVID-19 and resulting in millions of deaths worldwide. As a coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 host interactions are
dictated through the Spike proteins that encompass the virion. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV2, is a highly
glycosylated trimer that interacts with the ACE2 receptor on host cells via the receptor binding domain (RBD)
to facilitate viral entry. As a key player in viral infection, the Spike trimer, and the RBD, have become the target
for a majority of approved therapeutics and vaccines used to treat or prevent SARS-CoV2. In this proposal, the
PI uses a novel antiviral lectin, BOA, which he has demonstrated that BOA binds glycans on the spike protein,
and inhibits SARS-CoV2 viral entry. To understand how BOA inhibits viral entry, during the K99 phase of the
award, the PI will determine the mechanism by which BOA inhibits in SARS-CoV2 viral infection using a
combination of viral inhibition assays, biophysical assays, and electron microscopy. Subsequently the PI will
test the ability of BOA to inhibit emerging SARS-CoV2 variants of concern that have accumulated mutations to
various regions of the spike protein that facilitate immune escape. Expanding upon these findings during the
independent R00 phase of this award, the PI will use skills developed during the K99 phase to establish his
own independent research group, where they will test the ability of the BOA lectin to inhibit viral entry of Beta-
Coronaviruses known to infect humans. Successful completion of these aims could provide a bona fide broad
spectrum coronavirus inhibitor to be further developed as a therapeutic or diagnostic for the next coronavirus
that emerges. The proposed research, will provide the PI with new and exciting training in virology as well as
electron microscopy which he intends to pass on to his future trainees. The proposed work will be completed at
The University of Pittsburgh, where the Department of Structural Biology and Center for Vaccine Research will
provide unmatched access to resources, instrumentation, and experts in the field. The PI has assembled an
exciting mentorship team of virologists and biophysicists who he will meet with monthly to receive advice,
discuss results, designed new experiments, and prepare for transitioning into an independent career. To aide
in his career development, the university offers numerous workshops to develop skills such as grant writing
and mentorship. The PI will also attend conferences to give presentations and hone his science
communications skills. In Summary, the proposed training and career development plans will prepare the PI to
lead his own independent research group and become a leader in his field."
11059980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social context is tied to health outcomes, driving the rapid adoption of screening for tangible social needs (e.g.
for housing, utilities, food) by healthcare systems. Our preliminary studies (R21HS026505, R01NR019944)
underscore the potential for narrowing health disparities by linking social needs screenings in clinical settings –
particularly in emergency department (ED) settings where 50% of patients endorse one or more need – to
United Way 211's (211) Service Navigators (SNs) through clinically-integrated and adaptable software
solutions. However, 34% of those with social needs seen in EDs provided either another person’s phone
number or only an email address for outreach, a factor we have linked to a decreased likelihood of connecting
to services; higher instances of housing, utilities, and transportation needs; and greater frequency of ED visits
compared to those who provide their own telephone number. Moreover, 24% lacked home internet and faced
considerable difficulties in establishing service connections, particularly with navigating online forms. These
findings highlight the role that Information and Communication Technology (ICT), specifically stable telephone
access, internet, and digital navigation, may play in meeting patients' social needs and the ability of community
services to improve health outcomes. In this NIH stage 3 real-world efficacy study, we will utilize a community-
engaged process and rapid cycle testing with partnering community, governmental, and clinical service
representatives to develop, refine, and launch an ICT screening and access program (stable cellphones and
digital navigation) in three ED settings across the state of Utah. Then, in a randomized controlled trial of 600
ED patients with social needs and ICT access barriers, we will leverage existing screening and referral
protocols to determine whether providing stable cellphones, 211 service outreach, and digital navigation
assistance to patients with social needs and ICT access barriers result in improved health outcomes over 6
months compared to patients who are offered cellphones and 211 service outreach alone. Our proposal meets
the goals of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) as it emphasizes the essential role of
technology access in fostering public health equity. By embedding advanced digital tools in social needs
screenings and referrals, we aim to close the gap between recognizing social needs and connecting individuals
to vital services using a scalable, sustainable approach."

(CHC) endorsed having at least one disability, and of those students, over three quarters had experienced IPV
or SV in their lifetime. Yet no interventions exist that address the specific and unique needs of SWD and that
offer harm reduction strategies to reduce risk for violence exposure and alcohol misuse (i.e., heavy episodic
drinking and excessive alcohol use). Particularly challenging for research and intervention development is the
continued ‘invisibility’ of disabilities, the stigma associated with disabilities, intersections with other forms of
marginalization such as racism, homophobia, and transphobia, and limited patient and community engagement
in alcohol research. Thus, the bioethical issues to be addressed in this proposal are: 1) development of a
shared framework for conducting research with college SWD designed with SWD and other constituents, and
2) identifying accessible human-centered design strategies to ensure full inclusion of SWD in co-creating
prevention interventions. This study leverages the parent study, a cluster randomized controlled trial of an SV
prevention program across 20+ college campuses in the U.S. (R01 AA023260, PI Miller). The parent study
supports a community of practice across these diverse campuses with campus administrators, those
responsible for accessibility services, diversity and inclusion, student safety, sexual assault prevention, alcohol
and drug counseling, student health services including counseling, and learning supports. Additionally, through
connections with student health and counseling centers, the parent study will facilitate recruitment of this
harder-to-reach population as well as campus personnel with expertise in serving students with disability to
participate in proposed study procedures. We will identify key ethical considerations for conducting research
with college SWD to guide college campus behavioral health research (Aim 1). We will implement accessible
human-centered design sessions with key constituents to co-create multi-level prevention interventions
focused on healing-centered supports for SWD (Aim 2). These aims are expected to contribute to research on
bioethical issues. First, the listening sessions will yield a toolkit to guide inclusive research practices that
center SWD. Second, the interventions that are co-created will be compiled in a community-partnered report
on recommendations from SWD on a) how to conduct accessible human-centered design sessions, and b)
ideas for inclusive prevention practices including strategies to increase provider competencies in serving SWD."

Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) causes endothelial inflammation and microvascular rarefaction that leads to
adverse kidney graft outcomes in organ transplant. Direct treatment of endothelial cells (EC) can reduce the
impact of IRI on the health of the graft, but there is a lack of EC targeted therapies that can effectively
intervene and alleviate the various modes of dysfunctional endothelial response. The goal of this work is to
develop a therapeutic strategy that addresses the two key modes of endothelial damage in response to IRI:
dysfunctional inflammation in ECs and damage to capillary networks, in a site-specific and temporary manner.
We propose that therapeutic siRNA can be delivered directly to endothelial cells using polymeric nanoparticles
(NPs), which provide a customizable platform to enhance the cell penetration and to sustain the delivery of
nucleic acids. In Aim 1, we will determine the NP characteristics utilizing a novel family of PACE polymers that
enable maximum and sustained siRNA to endothelial cells in order to reduce adhesion molecule expression
upon inflammatory activation. In Aim 2, we will translate this knowledge of structure/function relationship of the
NP to rationally design siRNA-mediated knockdown of adhesion molecules in relevant models of 3D human
vasculature and evaluate the long-term effect after transplantation in vivo. In the R00 phase of the award, the
principles determined in Aim 1 and 2 to impact endothelial-NP interaction will be applied to polymer NPs
delivered within a hydrogel delivery vehicle to the renal cortex. Aim 3 will investigate the potential of
endothelial-tailored siRNA-NPs to locally deliver anti-fibrotic siRNAs within an ECM-derived hydrogel to IRI-
damaged renal cortex in vivo.
Dr. Laura Bracaglia has earned her PhD in Bioengineering and began this investigation as a postdoctoral
fellow in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. In her training so far, she has studied
NP and drug delivery methods in human tissue models that provide translatable insights into vascular
inflammation. During the first year of this fellowship, she acquired additional training in the 1) chemical and
polymer science aspects involved in the development of NPs, 2) vascular immune biology, 3) renal pathology
and response to injury, and 4) translation to human immunology. With newly gained expertise in these key
areas, Laura has continued this investigation as an independent investigator in her new role as Assistant
Professor at Villanova University."

 Parent Grant: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) incidence is disproportionally high among adolescents and
young adults aged 15-24 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends “catch-
up” vaccination for young adults through 26 years. However, young adults, specifically college students, continue
to display alarmingly low rates of HPV vaccination. The parent grant aims to develop and test a multilevel
narrative-based intervention designed to address individual- and system-level factors to increase school-based
vaccine access and HPV vaccine uptake among Texas college students. Proposed Diversity Supplement:
This supplement will benefit the parent grant research by examining interpersonal influences on HPV vaccination
decision-making that exist between the individual and system levels of influence as denoted in the parent grant
and the Social Ecological Model. Importantly, parents and friends are often cited as the most influential people
in vaccine decision-making among young adults. However, parents and friends can be perceived to express
HPV vaccine disapproval, which can result in increased stigma surrounding the HPV vaccine. In this supplement,
we will: (1) identify sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors of perceived HPV vaccine disapproval from
family and friends (Aim 1); (2) examine how perceived HPV vaccine disapproval impacts both the behavioral
skills needed to vaccinate against HPV and the stages of HPV vaccine decision-making (Aim 2); and (3) test
the parent grant intervention’s ability to reduce perceived HPV vaccine disapproval from family and friends and,
consequently, reduce HPV vaccination disapproval at follow-up (Aim 3). We will perform secondary data analysis
using baseline and follow-up data from the parent grant. Block-sequential multivariate regression will be
performed to determine sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors of HPV vaccine disapproval from parents
and friends (Aim 1). Multinomial logistic regression will be used to test whether perceived HPV vaccine
disapproval from family and friends is associated with an increased likelihood of being in the earlier stages of
HPV vaccine decision-making. A path analysis will be performed to examine the impact of perceived disapproval
from family and friends on HPV vaccination intentions through different behavioral skills (e.g., self-efficacy and
information-seeking; Aim 2). Finally, both linear and logistic regression mediation analysis will be performed to
examine whether the intervention is associated with decreases in perceived HPV vaccine disapproval from family
and friends, which, in turn, decreases HPV vaccination disapproval at 3-month follow-up (Aim 3). Ultimately, this
work will benefit the parent grant by identifying groups of college students who experience high levels of
perceived vaccine disapproval/stigma from important others and, thus, are at high risk of being vaccine-hesitant
and/or “stuck” in their HPV vaccination decision-making. In addition, this work may highlight the benefits of
tailoring the parent grant intervention to college students who perceive interpersonal barriers to HPV vaccination."

This is a DP2 NIAID New Innovators Award proposal to harness cell-to-cell variability to understand viral infection
outcomes at the single cell level. Infected cells differ in the outcome of infection (abortive/productive), the timing and
level of viral gene expression and the number of progeny they produce. Two striking phenomena revealed by studying
infection at the single cell level are (1) the ability of some cells to abort infection after viral gene expression has
commenced and (2) the fact most infected cells release very few progeny while a small fraction of cells release thousands
(here termed “super producers”). While it is now accepted that cell-to-cell variability affects infection outcome, we
currently lack a molecular understating of the determinants of infection outcome in single cells, mainly due to the lack of
appropriate tools and methodologies.
Understanding these determinants is likely to lead to the discovery of novel cellular anti-viral modalities, better design of
therapeutics and deepen our understanding of the viral life cycle. In this proposal I will apply cutting-edge technologies to
investigate virus-host interactions at the single cell level and gain mechanistic insights as to the host factors that control
the opposing phenotypes of abortive infection and super producers.
My central hypothesis, supported by my past work and preliminary data using Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) as a model
system, is that infection outcome at the single cell level is dependent on the cell’s state at the time of infection and on the
activation of specific cellular transcriptional programs. To test this hypothesis I will develop new approaches to interrogate
virus-host interactions by combining viral genetics, single-cell RNA-sequencing, custom-made microfluidic devices, live-
cell imaging and machine learning approaches. My background in performing cross-disciplinary research through the
combination of classical virology, cell-biology, microfluidics and systems biology to study virus-host interactions uniquely
positions me to successfully tackle these important questions. My results will identify the host factors that determine
infection outcome and define a new paradigm, using cell-to-cell variability to understand virus-host interactions. The tools
and technologies will be developed using HSV-1 as a model system, and then applied to investigate other important viral
pathogens, in collaboration with leading virologists.
This “high-risk high-reward” project requires a considerable investment of time and resources and the construction of
new tools, making it a perfect fit for the DP2 program. The award will allow me to pursue cutting-edge science at the
interface of virology and single cell biology and establish a long-term research plan to decipher the cellular mechanisms
that control infection outcome."

Policies restricting the sale of flavored tobacco products (FTP) are being enacted in localities around the US.
We seek to expand the evidence base about the extent to which these policies decrease access to FTPs and
exposure to flavored tobacco marketing and would likely reduce use of tobacco among youth and young
adults. Additionally, few studies examine the potential of these policies to reduce tobacco-related health
disparities among youth/young adult populations of color and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES).
These vulnerable populations use flavored products at higher rates and FTPs are heavily marketed in
communities where these vulnerable groups live. Determining the impact of FTP policies overall and on
populations of color and lower SES youth/young adults in these communities can make sure that policies are
structured to ensure equitable reach and reduce tobacco use disparities. The purpose of this study is to
determine the impact of flavor policies on reducing exposure to and use of FTPs among vulnerable
youth/young adults. Using the Policy Implementation Framework and the Elaboration Likelihood Model as our
theoretical guides, we combine national, local and individual data to examine the equity impact of flavor
policies around the US. To accomplish the study purpose we will conduct several aims. (1) We will use a
longitudinal national dataset of youth and young adults (n=13,892) followed for nine waves twice a year from
2014 to examine changes in tobacco marketing exposure and FTP and non-FTP use in those exposed to an
FTP policy with no FTP policy exposure over time, focusing on differences by race/ethnicity and SES. (2) We
will compare marketing exposure to and appeal of FTP/non-FTPs between emerging adults in communities
covered by flavor policy variants through ecological momentary assessment (EMA), evaluating differences in
outcomes by SES and race/ethnicity at the individual and neighborhood level. (3) Finally, among EMA
participants, we will assess the predictive validity of exposure to FTP/non-FTP marketing exposure on use of
FTP and non-FTPs at 6-month follow-up, and evaluate whether these outcomes are associated with SES and
race/ethnicity. For all of these activities, we will partner with national and local FTP policy experts who will
disseminate lessons learned to communities who have or are considering an FTP policy. Achieving the aims of
this R01 will expand the evidence base of the impacts of FTP policies on reducing tobacco use and potential
equity impact of these policies to reduce tobacco, and ultimately cancer disparities."

Maintenance of normal hematopoiesis depends on developmental programs for the hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cell (HSPC). Still, these programs require guidance by cell-extrinsic mechanisms that correctly convey
the dynamically changing needs of the blood cells. Our prior work established that the hepatocyte-specific
Ashwell-Morell receptor (AMR), a multimeric endocytic receptor, binds to aged platelets, inducing JAK-STAT
signaling and production of thrombopoietin (TPO), the cytokine responsible for megakaryocyte maturation and
differentiation, platelet production, and maintenance of HSPCs. In addition to regulating TPO production and
removing aged platelets, we uncovered an unexpected mechanism by which the AMR regulates erythropoiesis.
Our preliminary data suggest a role for the hepatic AMR in regulating Neuregulin 4 (Nrg4) levels, the specific
ligand for ErbB4 (also known as HER4), the fourth member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR/HER1), ErbB2/HER2, and ErbB3/HER3. A genome-wide
association study (GWAS) shows that NRG4 variants are associated with changes in hemoglobin levels, and
ErbB4 signaling contributes to human and mouse erythropoiesis.
Our data shows that an increase in Nrg4 affects ErbB4 expression and signaling in bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs), leading to defective erythropoiesis and increased expression levels of S100a8 and S100a9,
members of the calcium-binding S100 protein family, known as Calgranulin A and B, respectively. Recombinant,
extracellular, and increased S100a8 expression levels in erythrocyte progenitors induce an erythroid
differentiation defect. We seek to define how Nrg4/ErbB4 affects HSPC homeostasis and erythropoiesis,
including erythroblastic islands (Aim 1). We will interrogate the mechanism by which Nrg4/ErbB4 affect MSC
function, calgranulin expression, and erythropoiesis (Aim 2). We use a multipronged approach of genetic mouse
modeling, inhibitors, transcriptomics, and biochemical approaches to allow mechanistic exploration into the
participation of the Nrg4/ErbB4/calgranulin axis in contributing to erythropoiesis. The proposed investigation will
further drive therapeutic development to ameliorate erythropoietic deficiencies in blood disease, including in
patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndrome."
11007397,"Selfish meiotic drive systems (SMDs) that cheat Mendel's law of segregation during gametogenesis are 
ubiquitous in nature. The wildtype activities of these selfish genes have negative fitness effects, such as 
distortion of sex-ratio (SR) or sterility. Therefore, SMDs are catalysts for intragenomic conflicts and place 
strong pressure to innovate host suppression mechanisms. Despite their ubiquity, the molecular 
mechanisms by which SMDs emerge, operate, and are silenced, generally remain poorly understood. A 
significant contribution from my postdoctoral work revealed a crucial role for hairpin RNA (hpRNA)-class 
siRNA loci in suppressing Dox family meiotic drivers on the X-chromosome in Drosophila simulans 
(Dsim). Furthermore, transcriptome profiling from RNAi mutants (Ago2 and Dcr2) in Dsim revealed an 
array of de novo hpRNAs that were born in the simulans clade and preferentially target X-chromosome 
genes, suggesting sex chromosomes as a breeding ground for intragenomic conflicts. I hypothesize that 
the surprising role(s) of RNAi in resolving intragenomic conflicts may be widespread across taxa, and 
untamed meiotic drive can propel speciation. The proposed work expands on my discoveries utilizing a 
multidisciplinary approach. First, in Specific Aim 1, using clues to the origin, and their provocative 
similarity to sperm packaging proteins, I will study how the Dox family drivers impair spermatogenesis, 
employing cutting-edge molecular biology and genomics. Based on conserved themes in genetic conflicts, 
I suspect a role for RNAi in resolving intragenomic conflict in mice, analogous to flies, and in Specific Aim 
2, I will test this hypothesis with the proprietary Ago-2 catalytic dead (Ago2-CD) mutant mice generated in 
Dr. Eric Lai's lab. The proposed work in SA2 will be performed in collaboration with Dr. Scott Keeney, an 
expert in mouse meiosis and spermatogenesis. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, I will build upon the exciting 
discovery in Dsim that several cryptic SMDs can be uncovered by ablating the RNAi pathway. I propose to 
employ RNAi mutants as a versatile ""tool"" to unmask cryptic SMDs in non-model insects, which otherwise 
take years of laborious genetics to identify and characterize SMDs."

 Mental disorders that affect the hippocampus disrupt people’s ability to form one-shot memories. My goal is
to lead an independent lab, linking biological properties of hippocampal neurons to the ability to perform memory-
guided cognitive behaviors. To map cognitive behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms, my lab will
perform theoretical analyses and simulation of state-space models of cognitive behaviors, implementing these
models in a recurrent network architecture with learning rules that match biological plasticity rules (Aims 3a, c).
To precisely characterize memory-guided behaviors at real-world complexity, my lab will apply state-of-the-art
behavioral tracking techniques in natural settings to foraging behavior of wintering birds, chickadees and
sparrows (Aim 3b). As a theorist, I will actively collaborate with experimentalists, drawing on my experience
recording from the brain in animals performing cognitive tasks.
 My postdoctoral work in the Aronov lab, at Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute, focuses on neural
activity underlying a hippocampus-dependent one-shot memory behavior, food-caching, in the model system
chickadees, caching birds with extreme memory abilities. I developed new methods for recording large
populations of neurons in the chickadee hippocampus while they cache and retrieve food, and methods for
precisely tracking their caching behavior (Aim 1a). Probing the hippocampus at moments of caching, I found a
new mode of hippocampal activity patterns (Aim 1b), which is reactivated when birds return to retrieve food (Aim
1c). To compare this one-shot mode to representations of consistent environmental features, I am reproducing,
in food-caching birds, findings from rodents showing changes to place cells at consistent reward zones, and
comparing this to one-shot representations of food-caching (Aim 2a). I am developing a theoretical state-space
model that explains both one-shot and consistent representations in the hippocampus (Aim 2b), incorporating
hippocampus-inspired neural mechanisms (Aim 2c).
 Here, I outline a training plan to expand my skills and experience to lead an independent lab doing a
combination of theoretical and real-world behavioral studies. I will deepen my training in theoretical methods
working with my co-mentor Prof. Larry Abbott, and through affiliation with the Columbia Center for Theoretical
Neuroscience. My training in tracking real-world behavior will be guided by my collaborator Prof. Vladimir
Pravosudov, the leading pioneer in tracking real-world chickadee behaviors, with an extended visit to his
Cognitive and Behavioral Ecology Lab and field sites. For additional training designing and fabricating custom
equipment, I will work with Dr. Tanya Tabachnik, who heads the Advanced Instrumentation Core at ZI. This
additional training, with instrumental support from the K99/R00 award, will prepare me well, and make me a
highly competitive candidate for tenure-track faculty positions."

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening vascular condition associated with high mortality rates
upwards of 80% upon rupture. Vascular inflammation plays a primary role in AAA, with chronic inflammation and
degradation of the extracellular matrix leading to segmental dilation of the aortic wall. However, clinical trials
involving anti-inflammatory therapeutics have failed to yield meaningful results. Currently, there are no FDA-
approved therapeutics to treat AAA. Our lab has demonstrated that treatment with synthetic high-density
lipoprotein (sHDL) nanoparticles has a protective effect in AAA, leading to a nearly two-fold reduction in AAA
incident and aortic diameter, highlighting the potential of sHDL for AAA treatment. Thus, the objective of this
proposal is to determine the mechanism by which sHDL attenuates AAA pathogenesis and optimize formulation
for effective treatment and delivery. We will accomplish this by 1) developing sHDL particles and determine
underlying protective mechanisms against AAA in vitro. Specifically, the effects of sHDL will be assessed in
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), macrophages, endothelial cells. We will also 2) evaluate and optimize
sHDL treatment in AAA mouse models. The successful completion of this present study will provide robust
mechanistic insight into how sHDL attenuates AAA pathogenesis through its actions at VSMCs, endothelial cells
and macrophages."
11049532,"Adolescence is a critical window for social maturation. Harmful experiences during adolescence can
produce life-long social impairments, partly by impacting key brain regions involved in social function, such
as the amygdala. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how experience during development
shapes the amygdala and its connections, and how their dysfunction produces social impairments. Social
motivation drives engagement in social behaviors, but there is a homeostatic balance that is sensitive to
social deprivation and satiety, and social behaviors need to reflect this balance. In our prior project period,
we found that medial amygdala (MeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) have complementary roles in social
behaviors and different sensitivities to factors that temper social motivation. We also demonstrated
differences between adult and adolescent social motivation, and their sensitivity to social change. But there
is a gap in our understanding of the synaptic and molecular changes that adjust social motivation over short
behavioral timescales and larger timescales between adolescence and adulthood. The prefrontal cortex
(PFC) sends excitatory glutamatergic projections to BLA, matures during adolescence, and has a key role in
regulation of many social behaviors. Our short-term goal is to uncover the synaptic and microcircuit
changes at the PFC-BLA interface that regulate social motivation, and how this matures during
adolescence. Fast glutamatergic synaptic responses in the BLA are predominantly driven by AMPA
receptors (AMPAR), whose impact depends on the subunit composition. Based on the prior project period
and preliminary data, we propose that there are functional shifts in relative AMPAR subunit composition at
PFC-BLA synapses to BLA output neurons, and to BLA GABAergic interneurons that regulate output
neurons. These contribute to a shift in social motivation during adolescence, and to rapid shifts during social
deprivation and satiety. We will test the hypotheses that during transition from adolescence to adulthood
there is a functional redistribution of AMPAR subunits so that PFC glutamatergic inputs to BLA GABAergic
interneurons gain relative strength compared to BLA output neurons, and changes in social motivation
rapidly change AMPAR subunit composition at PFC-BLA synapses to permit an appropriate adaptation in
social behavior. The Aims of this project are to determine (1) cellular and synaptic elements in BLA that
contribute to emergence of a mature PFC-BLA impact, (2) the role of AMPAR at PFC-BLA synapses in
adapting to social motivation changes, and (3) the functional impact of PFC inputs on BLA encoding of
social cues during changes in social motivation. This project is significant because it will delineate a
synaptic mechanism for modulation of social motivation, and how this matures into adulthood. This will yield
exciting new perspectives about parallel development of social regulation and PFC-BLA circuits, and is an
important step towards understanding how dysfunctional PFC-BLA circuits cause social impairments."

 Head and neck cancer (HNC) remains a lethal disease despite concerted efforts to improve its diagnosis and
treatment. Although smoking, drinking, and HPV infection are closely linked to HNC, emerging evidence also
suggests that changes in the human microbiome are associated with HNC. However, little is known about how
altered microbiota affect HNC pathogenesis or its treatment. The oral cavity, which is directly relevant to the
local microenvironment in HNC, harbors one of the most complex and diverse microbiomes of all human
anatomical sub-sites. However, how the oral microbiota shapes the local and systemic environment in HNC
pathogenesis is completely unknown.
 Our long-term goal is to determine the functional role(s) and mechanisms of action of the microbiome in HNC
and to translate these findings into novel preventative and therapeutic strategies. In the proposed study, we will
extend and deepen previous studies of human microbiota in HNC, focusing on a prevalent form of HNC with
high mortality and morbidity, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our Specific Aims are as follows 1) To
define OSCC-associated metagenomic and metabolomic signatures in treatment naïve OSCC cases and non-
OSCC controls and 2) To determine whether microbiota transfer from human OSCC cases to mouse models
promotes tumorigenesis and characterize the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our approach is innovative
because it represents a departure from the status quo by utilizing unique experimental mouse models and state-
of-art technologies to move beyond observational human studies to delineate the molecular, cellular, and
immunological mechanisms induced by the human microbiome in OSCC pathogenesis. The proposed research
is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how the microbiome as a whole,
as well as specific microbial taxa, genes, and pathways, impacts OSCC. Ultimately, such knowledge has the
potential to be developed into effective therapies for OSCC patients, a pressing need given the significant
incidence and poor prognosis of this disease."
11058134,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Craniofacial fibrous dysplasia (CFD) is a disabling skeletal disease with no curative medical therapies. It is
characterized by fibrotic, expansile bone lesions that compress surrounding craniofacial structures and cause
significant morbidity, including vision loss, hearing impairment, dysmorphic facies, fractures, pain, and dental
and jaw abnormalities. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) can affect one or more bones throughout the skeleton, but the
femur, ribs and craniofacial skeleton are the most commonly affected sites. FD is caused by a somatic, mosaic
activating mutation in GNAS, the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding
protein, Gsa, leading to constitutive activation of Gsa and elevated intracellular cAMP levels in affected tissues.
CFD can occur in isolation or in association with McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS), which is characterized by
polyostotic FD (FD affecting more than one bone), café-au-lait-skin hyperpigmentation and precocious puberty.
There are no approved medical treatment options for FD, and there is a critical need to understand the
pathways that are activated downstream of Gsa to identify potential therapeutic targets for this disabling
disease. Our single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data on cells collected from human craniofacial and non-
craniofacial FD bone lesions has identified critical signaling pathways that are up-regulated in FD, including
TGFβ signaling. TGFb signaling is critical for healthy skeletal development and repair, but when inappropriately
activated, it is a significant driver of tissue fibrosis, including pulmonary, renal and systemic fibrosis. Despite its
established role in driving fibrosis of non-skeletal tissues, the contributory role of TGFb signaling in FD bone
lesions remains unknown. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of TGFβ signaling in driving
the fibrotic bone phenotype seen in FD/MAS. Our central hypothesis is that TGFβ signaling is activated in
response to Gs-GPCR signaling and contributes to the fibrosis and aberrant osteogenesis seen in FD lesions.
To test our hypothesis, we will pursue 2 aims. The first aim will elucidate the mechanisms driving TGFβ signaling
in response to Gs-GPCR overactivation at a cellular level. We will use our iPSC model of FD/MAS to generate
neural crest-derived mesenchymal osteogenic lineage cells and test the effect of TGFb stimulation and inhibition
on the fibrotic profile of these cells at different developmental stages. The second aim will use an in vivo murine
model of FD in which GNASR201H is expressed in early osteoblastic lineages to test the effect of TGFβ signaling
inhibition on the development of fibrosis and impaired osteogenesis using a pan-TGFβ antibody. Upon
successful completion of this project, we aim to shed light on the interplay between Gs-GPCR and TGFβ signaling
in the skeleton and apply this knowledge to the treatment of CFD as well as more common diseases of impaired
osteogenesis such as osteoporosis, heterotopic ossification, and fracture repair. The data generated in this
proposal will be used in future grant applications to explore the role of metabolic and growth factor signaling
pathways that are dysregulated in response to constitutive Gs-signaling."
11061617,"Tumor metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer progression, survival, and therapeutic
resistance. A targetable class of cancer metabolic adaptation exploits mitophagy, a specialized
autophagy pathway known to be linked to the cancer phenotype. Mitophagy selectively eliminates
dysfunctional mitochondria by targeting them, via autophagosome shuttling, to the lysosome for
degradation. Cancer cell mitophagy is triggered by elevated oxidative stress and mitochondria DNA
damage caused by hypoxia, radiotherapy, molecular therapy, and immunotherapy. A high mitophagy
demand can overwhelm the lysosome capacity resulting accumulated damaged mitochondria that is
harmful to the cell. We hypothesize that the newly discovered process of secretory mitophagy
exports damaged mitochondrial fission-released segments to reduce the overload pressure on the
lysosomal system, and thereby sustain cancer cell survival in the face of therapeutic mitochondrial
stress. We have discovered a form of secretory mitophagy occurring in vivo in a growing solid tumor.
Our molecular analysis of the full repertoire of extracellular vesicles (EV) shed into the resident tumor
interstitial fluid (IF) in vivo yielded a rich set of information about the functional state of mitochondria
within the tumor cells, and the host cells. Within tumor IF, and within the culture media of cancer cells
undergoing oxidative stress, we identified an EV-packaged full set of mitochondria molecules
comprising the peripheral fission pinched-off segment of the mitochondrial organelle. It has recently
been found that peripheral mitophagy fission, regulated by mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1), is a
key essential regulator of mitophagy, distinct from mid-zone mitochondria biogenesis. We also found
that mitophagy inducer PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) cleavage status (full length versus cleaved),
is prominently reflected in the set of mitochondrial proteins exported within IF EVs, and may constitute
a new quantitative measurement tool to monitor the real-time state of tumor intracellular mitophagy.
Our findings raise important mechanistic questions, that we will explore in the Aims. Under Aim 1 we
will test the hypothesis that peripheral fission secretory mitophagy is induced by high mitophagy
demands that overwhelm lysosomal engulfment, and explore if secretory mitophagy is distinct from
secretory autophagy within the murine 4T1 and human MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer
cell lines. Under Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the ratio of full length to cleaved PINK1 is
elevated (mitochondria damage sensor) within the exported murine syngeneic breast tumor IF EVs,
following treatment with mitophagy inducers Mito-CP and Rapamycin. The outcome is new
understanding of the importance of secretory mitophagy that can constitute an important therapeutic
target, and a new clinically relevant means of monitoring the in vivo cancer state of mitophagic flux."

of immobilized proteins in an amyloid-like state. While many cellular bodies have been described as liquid-like
(e.g., stress granules, P-bodies, germ cell granules), the discovery of Amyloid-bodies provided evidence of an
amyloidogenic program that can physiologically transition biological matter to a solid state. Amyloid-bodies are
found in sub-populations of cells in normal tissues, the core of low-grade human tumors and cells responding to
various stimuli highlighting their ubiquitous nature. Proteomic analysis revealed that Amyloid-bodies immobilize
participants of the DNA synthesis machinery and cell cycle control, amongst many other metabolic regulators.
Intriguingly, Amyloid-bodies share many biophysical properties with the amyloidogenic, solid-like Balbiani-bodies
involved in metabolic suppression in Xenopus. Likewise, yeast solidify elements of their proteome to sporulate
and arrest growth in non-permissive conditions. This raises the fascinating possibility that stressed cancer cells
assemble Amyloid-bodies to enter a spore-like state of extreme metabolic depression.
We recently showed that rIGSRNA coordinate a RNA tailing program mediated by their interactions to Terminal
NucleotidylTransferases 4b (TENT4b) to drive Amyloid-bodies biogenesis. This post-translational pathway
enables cancer cells to immobilize elements of the DNA synthesis machinery and halt oncogenic signaling in an
adaptive response to severe environmental insults In this Diversity Supplement Proposal, Ms. Rios will focus her
efforts on three goals that a included in Specific Aim #2 and #3 of the Parental NCI R01. Based on these
preliminary and published results, we hypothesize that “RNA tailing program drives amyloidogenic phase
transition to induce metabolic suppression of cancer cells”. We plan to test this hypothesis by: 1- Test the
role of rIGSRNA/TENT4b interactions in phase transition and 2- Examine the role of phase transition in clinical
samples and orthotopic tumor models. The discovery of dedicated enzymatic programs that drive physiological
amyloidogenesis provides a unique opportunity to study the role of liquid-to-solid phase transition in human
clinical samples and in vivo tumor assays. By studying clinical samples, in culture and orthotopic animal models,
we will test if phase transition induces a unique and yet uncharacterized cancer cell state of extreme metabolic
depression, while highlighting biochemical functions for low complexity RNA typically discarded as useless
nucleic acids."

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is a common inherited heart disease that can cause major limitations to
daily acts of living, poor prognosis, and mortality. There are as many as 1.5 M people with HCM in the US alone, 2/3 of
whom have the obstructive form of the disease with over 50k remaining refractory to medical management and are
candidates for septal reduction therapy (SRT). Despite this, only ~1,200 patients per year of the 50k currently indicated
receive SRT, leaving the vast majority of the most severe patients untreated. The reason for is the highly invasive nature of
existing SRTs that cause frequency cardiac rhythm abnormalities requiring implantation of a pacemaker or cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) and have unacceptably high rates of peri- and post- procedural mortality (up to 10%). Additionally, many
patients are unsuitable for existing SRT procedures due to existing co-morbidities and/or anatomical limitations.
This Phase II SBIR proposes development of a novel treatment for oHCM by precisely targeting the source of the obstruction
on the interventricular septum (IVS) using a novel high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) catheter. Our approach
takes a relatively safe, femoral venous approach to the right ventricle (RV) using existing delivery tools and knowhow
within cardiac electrophysiology. Treatment focuses on delivery of HITU to selectively ablate the entire mid-myocardium
of the IVS while sparing the cardiac conduction system on the sub-endocardium (His-Purkinje), thereby reducing risk of
heart block requiring pacemaker or ICD insertion.
This proposal builds upon the Phase I-equivalent work in acoustic physics, and pre-clinical proof of concept with a prototype
catheter demonstrating that, by generating deep lesions in the mid-septum with a HITU, the IVS thickness can be reduced
by approximately 30%. Based on catheter irrigation features and HITU’s natural focusing characteristics sparing the sub-
endocardium, heart block can be avoided even in the setting of extensive ablation in this region.
The aims of this proposal will focus on maturation of catheter design elements and manufacturing methods to make the
prototype device suitable for clinical evaluation, verify the functionality and safety of the system to relevant international
safety standards (particularly IEC 60601-2-62 standards), and validate the safety, efficacy, and durability of this therapy in
acute and chronic (3-month) preclinical models via clinically accepted modalities (cardiac MRI, TTE, clinical pathology,
gross pathology and histopathology).
The information obtained in this grant will be used in direct support of early feasibility IDE submission with the FDA as
part of a future phase of the grant. Commercialization of our system will bring lifesaving therapy to thousands of critically
ill patients every year and eventually expand to treatment of HCM patients in earlier stages of the disease before long-
standing obstructive hypertrophy resulted in irreversible health consequences."

Cerebral edema is the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality following traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Though a major target for intervention, current treatments have limited success, perhaps due to the incomplete
understanding of edema mechanisms. The task of this proposal is to dissect potential mechanisms underlying
TBI-associated neuronal edema, with a particular focus on how edema affects neuronal and network excitability
after mild and severe injury. We recently found that neuronal swelling is associated with reduced expression of
the cation chloride transporter KCC2 48 hours after controlled cortical impact (CCI) TBI. To our initial surprise,
we discovered that neuronal swelling coincided with reduced cellular and network excitability 48 hours post-
CCI. And furthermore, when we treated neuronal swelling we observed increased excitability - suggesting that
neuronal volume and excitability changes are intimately linked. These results were unexpected, as we predicted
that lower levels of KCC2 expression would increase intraneuronal chloride and reduce the efficacy of inhibition
– an effect that would increase excitability. However, the excitability of neurons is also affected by their shape:
an edematous neuron is less excitable, which may overpower effects of KCC2 on chloride homeostasis. Moreover,
despite continued reductions in KCC2 expression, neuronal volume is normalized by one-week post-CCI. This
implies that mechanisms beyond KCC2 expression are involved in neuronal volume regulation. This proposal
focuses on mechanisms of neuronal edema and its resolution after TBI. In addition, these studies will examine
the contributions of neuronal and astrocytic mechanisms on excitability following injury and during recovery.
We will test our hypotheses using genetic manipulations, simultaneous in vivo whole cell recording and two-
photon microscopy, and histological techniques. In Aim 1, we examine the mechanisms of neuronal edema at 48
hours and at 1 week after CCI and mild TBI, time points when edema is maximal and resolved, respectively. We
hypothesize that extracellular impermeant anions are the missing element in the edema response. In Aims 2 &
3, we examine how neuronal volume (and associated chloride shifts) affect excitability at 48 hours and one week
after TBI. In Aim 2, we examine to what extent: 1. GABAergic activity is rendered excitatory after TBI, and 2.
neuronal volume impacts mechanisms of chloride and water movement across neuronal membranes to influence
inhibition. In Aim 3, we assess the effects of neurons (i.e., neuronal volume and chloride transport) and
astrocytes (potassium and glutamate clearance) on excitability. In particular, we will examine susceptibility to
seizures and spreading depolarizations, which are two key consequences of the hyperexcitable network after TBI.
We hypothesize that failure to reuptake potassium and glutamate by astrocytes may contribute - in conjunction
with neuronal effects - to enhanced excitability. Our findings will result in a mechanistic understanding of
neuronal edema and excitability, including potential drug targets, which in turn could prompt a reassessment of
how and why we treat edema clinically."

Young-adult alcohol misuse is a public health problem causing thousands of assaults, injuries, and deaths
each year. Both college and non-college adults frequently report high drink counts (e.g.,10+ drinks) and
many alcohol-related consequences. Approximately 13% meet criteria for past-year alcohol use disorder
(AUD) and problems associated with AUDs frequently continue into midlife. Although measurement of
drinking is necessary for assessing these risks, concerns have been raised about exclusive reliance on
self-reported drink counts, especially on heavier drinking nights. Our pilot work supports this concern,
showing that over 12 weekend days: 1) 70% of the sample reported blackouts (55% reporting multiple
blackouts), and 2) the rate of blackout was 1 in every 3 drinking days. These and associated impairments
may affect the accuracy of self-reported drinking and lead to underestimation of the links between alcohol
consumption and outcomes (consequences and AUD). To address this concern, we have used objective
watchband-like transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) biosensors in our studies. TAC assesses alcohol
use in near real-time and records the manner in which alcohol is being consumed through continuous
measurement of alcohol intoxication. TAC features from the rising portion of the curve for each drinking
day – rise rate, peak, and rise duration – capture dynamic aspects of drinking behavior that standard drink
counts do not. Our pilot data provide evidence that TAC features predict consequences and are
associated with baseline AUD. These findings are promising, but they are limited to small samples over
short time spans (1-4 weeks). These short time spans limit generalizability of TAC effect size estimates
and have prevented prospective tests of TAC features as predictors of outcomes that develop over long
time spans (i.e., AUD). The proposed research addresses these gaps using a large-scale measurement
burst design consisting of eight 14-day bursts across two years among 500 young adults (ages 19-22)
who frequently engage in heavy episodic drinking. Aim 1 will examine TAC features as predictors of
alcohol-related consequences, relative to EMA self-reports. Aim 2 will assess AUD using DSM criteria at
baseline, 12, and 24 months and focus on examining the contribution of TAC features, relative to EMA
self-reports, in predicting AUD. The scientific premise of our research is fully supported by the literature
and our past studies. Together, these warrant further study of how well TAC features can predict: 1) event
level alcohol-related consequences, and 2) AUDs. Our approach uses a rigorous longitudinal and
multimodal measurement burst design to address these significant gaps in the field."
11054185,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that results from the targeting and destruction of
pancreatic islet β cells by autoreactive immune cells, including CD4+ T cells. The cellular processes that
break immune tolerance in individuals genetically predisposed to autoimmunity are poorly understood. In
particular, very little is known about the events that occur at the islet-immune interface that cause auto-
immune targeting of β cells. While identifying β cell autoantigens is of great importance, elucidating how β
cell proteins become immunogenic is crucial. Many environmental and physiologic factors associated with
T1D, including Coxsackie virus B (CVB) infection, can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/dysfunction
increasing ER dysfunction and the potential for abnormal handling and post-translational modification (PTM)
of proteins. The subsequent presentation of these abnormally modified proteins (neo-antigens), by antigen
presenting cells (APC) to T cells breaks immune tolerance and exacerbates pathology in many diseases,
including T1D. In the context of genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity and failure of peripheral tolerance,
the presentation of abnormally modified proteins by antigen presenting cells (APC) to T cells initiates
pathology in a number of diseases. Therefore, ER stress induced for example, by CVB infection, within β
cells may generate abnormally modified proteins that act as neo-antigens for the autoimmune response in
T1D. Indeed, our work demonstrates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in b cells increases cytosolic
calcium Ca2+ and the activity of tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG2), leading to PTM generation by deamidation
forming neo-epitopes and increasing T cell recognition. Furthermore, we have shown that subjects with T1D
have elevated frequencies of T cells that recognize deamidated neo-epitopes and that T cells with these
specificities can be found in the pancreatic lymph nodes of organ donors with T1D. Hence, it is plausible
that T cells that recognize deamidated epitopes, resulting from CVB triggered ER stress induced Ca2+ flux
and activation of tTG2 enzymes become activated and expanded in subjects who progress to develop type
1 diabetes. Furthermore, recent work demonstrates that enterovirus family members show a strong
association with islet autoimmunity in human T1D patients and a sizeable percentage of type 1 diabetic
patients have prolonged/persistent enterovirus infection associated with gut mucosa inflammation. To
assess the role of CVB infection in T1D progression we will define the mechanisms by which CVB infection
affects ER stress-mediated PTM of β cell proteins, contributing to β cell immunogenicity in human islets in
vitro, and further determine the mechanism by which CVB infection causes a break in tolerance and
accelerated disease in vivo. We will also assess therapeutic strategies that impede these enzymatic
mechanisms to affect T1D progression."

Although mild post-stroke aphasia is often disabling, there are no accepted treatments for this condition.
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in conjunction with Speech-Language Therapy, has been
demonstrated to improve language function in subjects with moderate to severe chronic aphasia. We propose
to study the effects of continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (a type of TMS) combined with a modified form of
Constraint Induced Language Therapy (mCILT) in 24 subjects with chronic, mild (operationally defined as
Western Aphasia Battery – Revised Aphasia Quotient >85) post-stroke aphasia. Subjects will be randomized in
a 2:1 ratio to cTBS with mCILT or sham cTBS with mCILT. After pre-treatment evaluation, subjects will receive
10 days of treatment; post-treatment evaluations will be performed 3-5 days and again at 2 and 4 months after
the completion of treatment. We will use electrical field modelling to personalize stimulation intensity for each
subject. Change from baseline to 4 months post-treatment on measures of language performance previously
demonstrated to distinguish people with mild, post-stroke aphasia from neurotypical will serve as the primary
outcome measure. A secondary aim is to explore the effects of the treatment on non-linguistic cognitive
functions and assess their role in the genesis of the communication impairment in mild aphasia."
11063630,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered hundreds of thousands of disease-associated
genetic variations, but a remarkable disconnect persists between GWAS findings and biological insight required
for clinical treatments and medicine advancement. Pinpointing the functional consequences of variants found in
GWASs is complicated by linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the inability to interpret non-coding variations.
Systematic genetic analysis of high-dimensional molecular and cellular datasets such as transcriptomics,
epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, offers the potential to bridge the gap from complex trait association
to relevant biological processes yet poses unsolved computational and analytical challenges.
 The candidate proposes to address major gaps in existing methodologies for mapping the genetic basis of
molecular phenotypes and integrating multi-omics data to improve disease gene discovery by developing a suite
of open-source statistical methods and publicly available analytical resources. The candidate will: 1) develop a
novel scalable statistical method to detect genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using large-
scale bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with an extension for rare variants; 2) assemble and
analyze more than 24 readily available bulk and scRNA-seq data sets for a comprehensive repository containing
cis- and trans-eQTLs of both common and rare variations; 3) develop an integrative method to improve power
for disease gene discovery by combining epigenetics, genome-wide eQTLs, and genetic variations.
 The proposed research and training plan were carefully designed to confer expertise in four domains: 1)
transcriptomics and epigenomics, 2) statistical methods development, 3) large-scale data analysis and tools,
and 4) professional development. These skills are fundamental to the candidate’s goal of becoming a leading
investigator who develops and applies statistical methods to understand molecular mechanisms of complex
diseases and traits. In addition to research training, the candidate will take coursework to gain greater expertise
in transcriptomics and functional genomics, participate in regular seminars, attend workshops and conferences,
and gain mentorship and teaching experience. All research will be conducted in the Analytic and Translational
Genetics Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute with mentorship from renowned
scientists Drs. Benjamin Neale and Mark Daly. Additional guidance from leading experts Drs. Xihong Lin, Ramnik
Xavier, Kristin Ardlie, and Bradley Bernstein will ensure exceptional guidance and support. Overall, the training
environment is outstanding, the mentors and advisors are world-class, the proposed studies address an urgent
unmet need, and the additional skills gained in this award will poise the candidate to establish independent
leadership in leveraging statistical genetics and large-scale multi-omics data for disentangling the etiology of
complex diseases."
11001699,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
Mammalian cells are continually exposed to environmental toxicants including UV-radiation and various
sources of ionizing radiation (IR) threatening genomic integrity, leading to an increased risk of cancer and
neurodegenerative disease. Given our constant exposure to environmental toxicants, elucidating
fundamental principles of genome integrity maintenance is critical for developing therapeutic interventions
for a host of age-related pathologies. In recent years, several chromatin-based events have been shown
to be critical mediators of an effective DNA damage response (DDR), however the lack of high-throughput
screening methodologies have significantly hampered the identification of chromatin factors essential for
DNA repair. To address this, this proposal will use a newly developed high-throughput screening
methodology, coupled with a cDNA library of predicted chromatin interactors (“ChromORFeome”), to
identify novel chromatin factors involved in DNA repair. During the R00 phase of this proposal, the
candidate will build upon the data developed during the mentored (K99) research phase to further
understand the importance of a newly identified chromatin-interacting protein, ZNF280A, for the repair of
DNA damage. Specifically, this proposal will seek to understand how ZNF280A is regulated in response to
DNA damage. This aim will use a range of complementary approaches including protein biochemistry,
phospho-proteomics, and mutagenesis analysis to map post-translational modifications on ZNF280A and
determine their importance for regulating the function of ZNF280A in DNA double-strand break repair (Aim
1). In addition, this proposal will build upon preliminary data generated during the K99 phase of the
proposal which identified novel protein-protein interaction networks, to determine mechanistically how
ZNF280A orchestrates DNA repair (Aim 2A) and ascertain whether this contributes to therapy resistance
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where increased expression of ZNF280A correlates with
significantly poorer outcome in patients (Aim 2B). In addition, very little is known about how chromatin
structure and function is re-established following DNA repair. To begin to explore this, the proposal will
utilize our recently developed high-throughput screening methodology to identify novel chromatin factors
involved in the late stages of DNA repair and mechanistically characterize how these factors orchestrate
the re-setting of chromatin architecture following DNA damage repair (Aim 3). These experimental aims
will provide the candidate with data for an early independent publication and preliminary data for R series"
10914737,"Aging affects all tissues and is associated with functional deterioration. Each tissue has specific aging 
kinetics, and the female reproductive system is the first to age. Female reproductive aging is associated 
with a decrease in oocyte quality and quantity as well as a reduction in the ovarian hormones, which 
accelerates women physiologic aging. Reproductive transitions, such as reproductive aging, are a priority 
of the Fertility and Infertility branch of the National Institutes of Health, and thus my proposed research is 
tightly aligned with the mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and 
Human Development. A major contributor to the age-associated reduction of female fertility is the 
decrease in oocyte quality due to an increase in oocyte aneuploidy, but our work and others have 
demonstrated that other factors, such as the tissue microenvironment, might contribute to the 
age-associated reduction in oocyte quality. Physical cues from the tissue environment are major 
regulators of cell behavior. In the ovary, stiffness is relevant for normal follicle development but also 
associated with pathological conditions. In mice, stiff environments maintain primordial follicles in a 
quiescent state. However ovarian stiffness is also a characteristic of polycystic ovarian syndrome in 
humans. In my postdoctoral work I pioneered the use of instrumental indentation to measure the 
biomechanical properties of the ovary and I found that mice ovaries become stiffer with advanced 
reproductive age. During the K99 phase of this award, I utilized in vitro follicle culture and alginate gels to 
demonstrate that the age-associated increase in ovarian stiffness impacts folliculogenesis and oocyte 
quality. My work on ovarian stiffness and folliculogenesis laid the foundation of this R00 application where 
I will test the overarching hypothesis that the age-associated and spatially-dependent increase in ovarian 
stiffness creates a physical environment that the follicle senses through the activation of 
mechanotransduction pathways. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. First, I will 
determine the subcellular features that define ovarian stiffness by performing a 3D spatiotemporal 
architecture map of the ovarian stiffness in an age and estrous cycle-dependent manner using a stiffness 
mapping system optimized during the K99 phase. Second, I will employ an in vitro system that enables 
precise control of the physical environment. In the K99 phase, I discovered that increased levels of"

small-molecule inhibitor of Transient Receptor Potential Canonical 6 (TRPC6) ameliorates cardiac and
skeletal myopathy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This research fulfills the candidate’s
long-term goals of advancing novel therapies for dystrophic cardiomyopathy and applying
mechanosensitive signaling assays in mice and engineered heart tissues (EHT) to study disease. DMD
results from a loss of dystrophin, inducing profound progressive muscle weakness, spinal deformities,
fibrosis, heart failure, and early mortality. TRPC6 is a mechanosensitive, non-voltage gated cation
channel expressed in muscle cells that is hyper-activated in DMD, mediating excessive mechanical
stress-induced force/Ca2+ responses, arrhythmias, cardiac dysfunction, and muscle fibrosis. During the
candidate’s postdoctoral training, he led projects assessing the impact of blocking TRPC6 genetically and
pharmacologically in models of cardiac fibrosis. Preliminary data in DMD show genetic or pharmacological
TRPC6 inhibition prolongs lifespan in severe DMD models by 2-3 fold, ameliorating fibrosis and
associated pathology, and improving heart and skeletal muscle function. The candidate first reported on
the TRPC6 drug inhibitor (BI 749327) in 2019, and its clinical derivatives are now in human trials for lung
and renal disease. In this proposal, the candidate addresses key questions whose answers will
importantly inform future DMD translational efforts, and organized into three aims. Aim 1 tests the efficacy
of chronic TRPC6 inhibition by BI 749327 to prevent and reverse DMD skeletal and cardiac muscle
dysfunction, histopathology, and TRPC6-NFAT, pro-fibrotic and inflammatory signaling. Cell-type
expression is analyzed by single-cell RNAseq to identify how subpopulations of cardiac cells that express
TRPC6 (fibroblasts, vascular, and myocytes) are impacted by the treatment. Aim 2 tests the capacity of
chronic TRPC6 suppression to restore mechanical activation-induced defects in force and calcium in
isolated DMD mouse cardiomyocytes, and to obviate effects of membrane sealants and other
mechanosensitive-activated pathways. I will further test the role of TRPC6 pathobiology in a novel human
DMD EHT model of mechanosensitive activation using the same mechanical stimuli as in mouse
cardiomyocytes. Aim 3 tests the efficacy of micro-dystrophin (ȝDys) gene therapy to treat TRPC6

Over the past decade, the federal government has spent more than $34 billion on the meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the acceptance rate for clinical decision support (CDS) alerts, a critical component of EHRs, is less than 10%. The large number of low relevance alerts (e.g. a weight loss alert during a cardiac resuscitation) not only increases the burden on clinicians, but can lead to the onset of alert fatigue, resulting in the neglect of important alerts and posing a serious threat to patient safety. Currently, alerts are improved primarily through manual review and by collecting user feedback. However, these methods are labor intensive and do not allow for a timely analysis of user responses to alerts from a comprehensive aspect. The amount of alert log data is large; Vanderbilt University Medical Center generated over 3 million alert firings in 2020. There is an urgent need to utilize the data from the alert log and EHR to develop a data-driven process to generate suggestions for refining alert logic or improving clinical processes.
To address this gap, I propose to use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) combined with bias mitigation techniques to build predictive models that comprehensively learn user responses to alerts and in turn automatically generate responsible suggestions to improve the original logic of alerts. In the K99 Phase, I developed a standards-based taxonomy of features that affect user response to CDS alerts (Aim 1) and a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using XAI approaches (Aim 2). In this R00 phase, I will evaluate generated suggestions using a mixed-methods design (Aim 3). I will use XAI approaches developed in Aim 2 to generate suggestions. I will ask CDS experts to review the AI-generated suggestions as well as human-generated suggestions for improving the same CDS alerts and rate the suggestions for their usefulness, acceptance, relevance, understanding, work- flow, bias, inversion, and redundancy. Throughout this research, I expect to produce a set of expert-validated suggestions based on the XAI approaches. This study could significantly contribute to the improvement of CDS management and clinical processes.
My career development plan and the proposed research are aligned with my current skills and experiences in CDS and machine learning. Overall, this project can help me launch an independent research career in developing explainable, intelligent CDS tools to improve patient safety, provide standardized care, and promote an equitable and efficient healthcare system."

Hepatic stellate cells participate in liver wound healing but also in progression of liver fibrosis and promotion
of liver cancer. Heterogeneous subsets of activated HSC (aHSC) are generated and assumed to have
different functionalities in liver disease. Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is manifested as acute on
chronic liver failure with high mortality on the background of cirrhosis harboring heightened aHSC activity.
Yet, the roles of aHSC in AH are understudied. This gap is remarkable considering known functions of aHSC
in both liver inflammation and fibrosis, the two key pathologic features of AH.
Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed the emergence of a novel subset of aHSC co-expressing the HSC marker
Lrat and the portal fibroblast marker Fbln2 in a murine AH model. The Lrat+Fbln2+ aHSC arise from Lrat+
quiescent HSC per genetic lineage tracing and constitute the most profibrotic, myofibroblastic and
inflammatory aHSC subset. Ade-convolution analysis of AH patient liver vs. healthy liver RNA-seq, supports
an expansion of such subset in AH patients and IHC and FISH confirm the presence of FBLN2+ aHSC
expressing inflammatory and immunoregulatory genes in AH patient livers. In a list of differentially
overexpressed genes in Lrat+Fbln2+ cells via scRNA-seq, we identified Prrx1 known for myofibroblast
(MFB) differentiation, the orphan nuclear receptor Nr4a2, and Cyp1b1. Supervised re-clustering by Prrx1
and Nr4a2 expression and subsequent RNA velocity and copy number variant (CNV) estimate analyses,
suggest the roles of these two nuclear proteins in the clonal development of Fbln2+ aHSCs. Further, in vitro
loss of function studies on FBLN2+ LX2 cells, reveal CYP181 being a driver of NR4A2 and PRRX1
expression and unique positive cross-regulations among them in the genesis and maintenance of the
proinflammatory MFB phenotype of LX2 cells. Based on these results, we propose to test the hypothesis
that CYP181 positively controls PRRX1 and NR4A2 which in turn positively feedback-regulate CYP181 to
support a clonal development of the FBLN2+ aHSC and contribute to the AH phenotype characterized by
heightened fibrosis, inflammation, and immunoregulation. To test this hypothesis, we aim to determine: 1) if
and how CYP181, PRRX1 and NR4A2 cross-regulate to generate FBLN2+ aHSC; 2) the phylogenic
makeup of the Lrat+Nr4a2+Prrx1+ subpopulation via simultaneous CNV and SNV analysis at single cell
level; 3) if CYP181 is required for the genesis of Lrat+Fbln2+ aHSCs in vivo and contributes to the AH
pathologic phenotype by using Cyp1b1'1f,-Fbln2-iCre-ERT2 mice; and 4) the translational relevance and
spatial characteristics of CYP181+, PRRX1+, NR4A2+ aHSCs in non-AH AALD vs. AH patient livers and
insights into their implications in a transition from the former to the latter. Through these efforts, we plan to
pursue our ultimate goal of identifying a disease-causing aHSC clone in AH, defining its underlying genetic
and molecular mechanisms, and designing innovative AH therapeutic approaches targeting such clone."

This supplement application seeks two years of support for Miss Angelina Li for post-baccalaureate training in
the Zha laboratory. Miss Li is expected to graduate with a B.S. from Barnard College in May 2024 with an
outstanding academic record (see transcript). She is a U.S. citizen and a first-generation college graduate of her
family. She plans to pursue Ph.D. training and become an independent investigator. The mentored research
experience supported by this supplement would give her firsthand experience in biomedical research and
develop critical thinking and project design skills as well as molecular biology, bioinformatics, and computation
knowledge necessary for successful Ph.D. studies.
The parental grant focuses on DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a DNA repair factor with a newly
identified role in RNA metabolism and a cancer therapy target. It will use genetic, cell biology, and single-
molecule approaches to dissect the role of DNA-PK during lymphoma and leukemia genesis and therapy. It has
three aims - 1) analyze RNA vs. DNA binding by KU and DNA-PK; 2) characterize the impact of acute KU-
depletion on RNA metabolism in human cells, 3) the physiological functions of the C-terminal region (CTR) and
tail of Ku80 in normal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation. The supplement project focuses on Aim 2:
Characterize the acute impact of KU deletion in human cells with an AID-Degron system, especially Aim 2.2:
Characterize the impact of KU depletion on other RNA metabolism in human cells. Briefly, our preliminary data
showed that inducing KU degradation in human cells (but not mice cells) causes lethality accompanied by a
robust interferon (IFN) response mediated by the MAVS-dependent double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing
pathway (see below). Given that KU binds to dsRNA and is very abundant in human cells, we hypothesize that
KU sequesters structured dsRNA to suppress innate immune responses. We will test this hypothesis in
this supplementary grant by Aim 1: Determine the role of KU on RNA metabolisms in human cells. Aim 1.1:
Characterize the cellular response (including IFN) to KU degradation in human cells. Aim 1.2: Systematically
characterize the dsRNA partners of KU in human cells via irCLIP data analyses. Aim 2: Characterize the
evolution of KU protein in human cells that facilitates its RNA-dependent function. Aim 2.1: Determine
the sequence and structural changes in human KU that facilitate RNA binding. Aim 2.2: Identify the transcription
and post-transcriptional mechanism that enables high KU expression in human cells. The completion of the
supplement will not only provide a valuable training experience for Miss Li but will also identify the previously
unknown functions of KU in human cells and address the long-standing question of why KU is essential in human
cells and why KU expression is 100 folds high in human cells. Both questions will be critical for the DNA-PK
kinase inhibitors developed for cancer therapy, since DNA-PKcs levels are also 50 foldes higher in human cells."
11062850,"Drug-device combinations containing active pharmaceutical ingredients marketed together with their
delivery devices are among the costliest medications in the US. Generic competition is vital for lowering prices
in the US and improving access, but generic entry can be slow for drug-device combinations. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) applies a necessarily rigorous set of requirements before approving these products,
given the complex interactions between ingredients and devices and the need for proper self-administration.
Despite the many regulatory challenges required for evaluation of drug-device combinations, the FDA does not
actively surveil adverse effects after approval, relying instead on spontaneous reports by patients and
clinicians. These may be subject to reporting bias and often lack the granularity needed for regulators to
distinguish among specific generic and brand-name products. Therefore, the FDA is increasingly considering
real-world evidence (RWE) generated from large longitudinal healthcare database studies as a tool for
informing regulatory decisions. Routine use of RWE to monitor the safety and effectiveness of generic drug-
device combinations can help ensure the reliability of pharmaceuticals, instill confidence in patients and
prescribers, facilitate timely regulatory action, and promote the public health goals of access and affordability.
 The proposed research will develop a principled, scalable, and reproducible approach for rigorous and
timely evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of generic drug-device combinations compared to brand-name
reference products using healthcare databases. We will demonstrate this approach for generating multi-phase
actionable RWE in 2-3 use cases, including description of utilization patterns, evaluation of comparative
effects, and systematic screening for unsuspected safety issues. The work will build on state-of-the-art
methods in pharmacoepidemiology to conduct research in a transparent and reproducible fashion.
 We will first rigorously describe the uptake and clinical characteristics of patients using generic drug-
device combinations compared to those taking branded versions (Aim 1). We will then examine several
prespecified safety and effectiveness outcomes for selected products, adjusting for confounding using
traditional propensity score methods with investigator selected covariates and high-dimensional propensity
score approaches, which semi-automatically adjust for hundreds of covariates selected through machine-
learning algorithms (Aim 2). We will supplement these analyses with studies to detect unsuspected safety
signals using tree-based scan statistic methods, which simultaneously evaluate thousands of correlated safety
outcomes while formally controlling type 1 error (Aim 3). We will then refine our understanding of potential
safety signals in fully specified protocols with confounding adjustment tailored to specific outcomes (Aim 4).
The end result will be a reusable framework and set of tools that the FDA can employ when using RWE to
evaluate complex generic drugs in the post-marketing setting."

Food insecurity is known to be associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease in adults. However, there
is a gap in our knowledge; specifically a lack of studies investigating factors that influence the emergence of
cardiometabolic risks from food insecurity during childhood and adolescence. An improved understanding of
the role of timing and severity of food insecurity on children’s cardiometabolic health (CMH), the
mechanisms/pathways between food insecurity and CMH, and the factors that buffer against or exacerbate this
risk are needed to inform intervention development to prevent later cardiometabolic disease amongst children
who are food insecure. The main objective of this prospective study is to understand how cardiometabolic risk
arises from food insecurity during childhood and identify malleable factors for intervention to buffer the negative
health impact of food insecurity on adolescent’s CMH. We will leverage an established cohort of
racially/ethnically diverse children from low-income households (n=627) participating in a prospective,
longitudinal study examining childhood obesity disparities (HL126171: Berge PI). Survey and ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) data have already been collected, including measures of food insecurity,
household environment (e.g., food environment, family functioning), child health behavior (e.g., diet quality,
sleep, physical activity) and parent behaviors (e.g., feeding practices, stress, coping) at two time points (~24
months apart) at ages 5-10. New measures proposed at ages 11-16 will include: (1) measures of CMH (Life’s
Simple 7 and state-of-the-science measures of body composition, metabolic and cardiovascular function,
oxidative stress and inflammation (i.e., cytokines)), (2) Geographical Information Services (GIS) data, and (3)
focus groups with families, school representatives, community organizations, and healthcare providers to
identify intervention targets and refine policies to reduce harmful health effects of food insecurity. Specifically,
this state-of-the art study will: (1) determine the impact of exposure to household food insecurity (i.e., severity,
timing) on child/adolescent CMH; (2) identify mechanisms/pathways between food insecurity and CMH; (3)
evaluate the extent to which child behaviors, parent factors, and access to resources impact the relationship
between food insecurity and CMH; and (4) using mixed-methodologies (biomarkers, focus groups, EMA, GIS),
prospectively examine the dynamics (e.g., severity, timing) of household food insecurity throughout childhood
and adolescence, and identify risk and protective factors at the level of the family, neighborhood, school, and
community to inform intervention and policy development. This approach is innovative because it represents a
departure from the status quo by focusing on when and how cardiometabolic risk emerges from food insecurity
during childhood and the multi-level factors which buffer against or exacerbate this risk, and significant
because it is expected to have implications for intervention development to prevent future cardiometabolic
diseases among adolescents from food insecure households."

There is a critical need to advance from gene discovery to the identification of actionable biological mechanisms
in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Despite considerable progress in the identification of high confidence
genes that are strongly associated with risk, advancing from ASD genes to biologically relevant cellular and
circuit mechanisms remains a central challenge. We established a high-throughput zebrafish system for the in
vivo functional analysis of multiple ASD genes in parallel. Our analysis of 10 ASD genes in zebrafish mutants
revealed novel points of convergence at multiple neurodevelopmental levels and uncovered ASD gene
subgroups with shared functional effects. As a critical next step, we will leverage the zebrafish system to analyze
the function of 50 ASD genes in parallel at the whole-brain transcriptomic, structural, and circuit levels and
translate our findings to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Our central objectives are to: (1)
identify convergent molecular signatures resulting from ASD gene LoF; (2) elucidate novel cellular and
circuit mechanisms contributing to whole-brain structural and activity phenotypes; and (3) uncover highly
conserved pharmacological pathways downstream of ASD genes. We hypothesize that ASD genes converge
on shared molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms in the developing vertebrate brain, which will allow us to
define novel ASD gene subgroups. This hypothesis is based on compelling evidence for biological convergence
across ASD genes from our group and others. To test this hypothesis, we perform molecular phenotyping of
ASD gene mutants using whole-brain single nuclear RNA-seq (Aim 1); identify cellular phenotypes contributing
to circuit deficits by combining in vivo imaging and cell-type-specific labeling (Aim 2); and conduct parallel
pharmacological screens to identify novel phenotypic suppressors in zebrafish and hiPSCs (Aim 3). The
expected outcomes of this research are to (1) define convergent molecular, cellular, and circuit phenotypes
downstream of ASD genes in the developing vertebrate brain; and (2) leverage the identification of
biologically relevant ASD gene subgoups with shared mechanisms to uncover novel pharmacological
pathways with translational relevance."

Parent award. The initial parent award (P20-GM103625) allowed the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (UAMS) to establish the Center for Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Inflammatory Responses
(CMPHIR). The scientific focus of the CMPHIR is on understanding infectious disease from the perspective of
diverse microbial pathogens and their impact on the host immunological and inflammatory responses influences
the disease process. This theme is based on the premise that understanding the complex interplay between
diverse pathogens and their common human host is a prerequisite to maximizing opportunities to manipulate
one or both sides of this equation in favor of the desired therapeutic outcome. The project is currently in Phase
III (P30-GM145393) with the goal of continuing to support and enhance the critical core facilities to support the
growing number of CMPHIR investigators, continue to provide administrative support to promote further growth
of the CMPHIR and the career development of its investigators, and promote the transition to a self-sustained
Center of Biomedical Research Excellence with the expertise and resources required to address existing and
emerging problems in infectious disease. The current proposal for a Team Science Administrative Supplement
application is directly in line with the goals of the CMPHIR and that it takes a comprehensive, team-based
approach to understanding how the crosstalk between microbiota and the host during antibiotic-induced
dysbiosis, so that new therapeutic strategies can be implemented to maintain host homeostasis and mitigate
disease risk. It is also a direct reflection of the growth of the CMPHIR in that it brings together three investigators
(one current CMPHIR P30 pilot recipient and 2 investigators with various other past COBRE and INBRE ties)
with distinct areas of expertise that can collectively take advantage of their specific strengths and cutting edge
technologies to comprehensively investigate fundamental disease-related processes of highly consequential
bacterial imbalance to an extent that otherwise would not be possible.
Research question. Antibiotic (ABX) use has significantly increased by more than 30% in recent years. Although
ABX fight infections, they also disrupt commensal microbe communities that are crucial for maintaining
homeostasis of various local and distal processes. Microbial imbalance induced by ABX, termed herein as
dysbiosis, has many systemic and long-lasting effects on the host including, but not limited to, increased risk of
vascular pathologies, e.g., solid tumors. Thus, there is a pressing need to reach a deeper understanding of the
crosstalk between microbiota and the host during dysbiosis, so that new therapeutic strategies can be
implemented to maintain host homeostasis and mitigate disease risk. The long-term overarching goal of this
supplement is to initiate a new line of investigation that brings together multiple scientific disciplines for a common
goal of understanding how dysbiosis influences vascular development. The overall objective of this application
is to rigorously and precisely define the molecular composition and cellular functions of small extracellular
vesicles (sEVs) from independent perspectives of an endothelial cell biology and innate immunity in the setting
of angiogenesis. Attaining this objective is critical for future deductive approaches that will guide development of
more effective vascular therapies in patients with acute and chronic dysbiosis. Our central hypothesis is that
independent lipid, nucleic acid and proteomic compositions of dysbiotic sEVs drives homing to vascular beds of
activated vascular endothelial cells and local activation of neutrophils that propel angiogenesis.
Team science approach. The work proposed here relies on the synergy created by a team of investigators,
each of whom brings a unique expertise and/or resource to the project. This truly is a team science approach,
as each of the laboratories bring distinct expertise, skillsets, resources and equipment with virtually no overlap
but shared interest in vascular biology. Our team is a collaboration between a tumor angiogenesis biologist
(Dings), an expert in small RNA and neutrophil biology (Allen), and a renowned expert in lipid metabolism and
lipidomics (Morris) at UAMS and the Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Research Center at the Arkansas Children’s
Hospital Research Institute (ACNC/ACRI). The Dings lab is an expert on ABX-induced dysbiosis and tumor
angiogenesis and will contribute murine models, endothelial cell lines and overall vasculature development
expertise necessary for the proposed studies. The Allen lab brings experience and expertise in extracellular
small RNAs transported by sEVs and lipoproteins, as well as innate immune activity within the vasculature. The
Morris lab is a renowned authority in lipid metabolomics and lipidomics. This supplement will facilitate the
development of a strong collaborative team with complementary skillsets and experimental approaches, thus
allowing for a unique and comprehensive experimental approach that would not otherwise be possible. Teams
will meet at least twice monthly to discuss results and strategize. The data generated will be used for subsequent
grant applications focused on understanding at the molecular and cellular level how dysbiosis-induced sEVs
modulate host vasculature and innate immune responses. Moreover, the data, tools, protocols, and experimental
approach will be applicable to any number of other diseases involving the microbiota. Ultimately, the work
proposed will further enable integration of lipidomics into the parent COBRE and will allow to lay the foundation
of establishing new research infrastructure and resources at the sponsoring institution to be able to support
investigators of other local and national COBRE/INBRE/CTRs in the future."

Over the past three decades, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of childhood obesity.
Childhood obesity leads to early onset of cardiovascular risk factors, and both obesity and cardiovascular risk
factors track into adulthood and contribute to the epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Developmental
Origins of Health and Disease theory posits that risk for obesity and CVD is, in part, programmed in utero. To
prevent this early entrenchment into obesity and CVD, identification of modifiable maternal factors during
pregnancy that later impact offspring risk in early childhood is essential. A surprising lack of research investigates
the role of prenatal sedentary behavior (SED), moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), and the
novel 24-hour behavior paradigm (the composition of SED, physical activity, and sleep) on these adverse
offspring outcomes. This is a critical research gap because there is strong physiological rationale that SED,
MVPA, and 24-hour behavior in pregnancy could influence offspring health, and these behaviors are modifiable
targets for intervention during pregnancy. The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the associations of SED
(Aim 1) and MVPA (Aim 2) across pregnancy with offspring obesity risk and CVD risk through 24 months. We
will also use novel statistical methods to determine the optimal 24-hour behavior compositions (Aim 3) during
pregnancy associated with reduced risk of these adverse offspring outcomes. We can achieve these aims by
leveraging our ongoing, multi-center cohort study Pregnancy 24/7 (R01 HL153095), where we are prospectively
measuring SED, physical activity, and sleep in 500 women in each trimester of pregnancy using state-of-the-art
monitors (activPAL3 micro and Actiwatch Spectrum Plus). Pregnancy 24/7 also assesses other relevant prenatal
exposures that may associate with offspring obesity and CVD risk, i.e., pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational weight
gain, diet, smoking, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In direct response to the NHLBI’s Notice of Special
Interest (NOT-HL-19-695), we propose to expand Pregnancy 24/7 by conducting a separate cohort study among
the offspring of its participants. In the Offspring Study, we propose to combine maternal exposure data from
Pregnancy 24/7 with new, comprehensive assessments of postnatal exposures, obesity, and CVD risk measures
in the child through 24 months via medical record abstraction, questionnaires, and an in-person study visit at 24
months. We hypothesize that offspring of women with higher SED or lower MVPA across pregnancy will have
more rapid increases in BMI Z-score (primary outcome), and greater adiposity, blood pressure, and pulse wave
velocity through 24 months. Further, we hypothesize that statistically reallocating time in SED to physical activity,
but not sleep (among adequate duration sleepers) will be associated with more optimal offspring outcomes. By
combining prenatal and postnatal exposure data, our approach uniquely allows us to isolate the effects of
pregnancy SED, MVPA, and 24-hr behavior on offspring obesity and CVD risk measures in early childhood. This
project will inform critically needed primordial prevention interventions to decrease the risk of obesity and CVD."

The proposed K01 award describes a research training program for Dr. Schola Matovu, an Assistant Professor
at the University of Utah College of Nursing. Her overarching goal is to become an independent investigator
conducting global health and gerontological research studies to improve the health and quality of life of older
adults with caregiving responsibilities, such as grandmother-caregivers (GMCs). This award provides support
for Dr. Matovu to achieve the following Career Development Goals to gain expertise in: 1) developing and
testing multi-component and culturally appropriate behavioral interventions in low-resourced settings; 2)
implementing aging and health disparities research related to aging, and performing geriatric health
assessment and coaching of community-dwelling GMCs; 3) behavioral clinical trial methodology; and 4)
research leadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Matovu has assembled a dedicated
team of mentors and advisors with expertise in family caregiving research (Dr. Lee Ellington, US Primary
Mentor), design and implementation of psychosocial interventions for Ugandan populations impacted by
HIV/AIDS (Dr. Noeline Nakasujja, Uganda Primary Mentor), mixed research methods and behavioral
interventions (Dr. Melissa Watt), gerontological nursing, rural care, and nurse-led health coaching (Dr. Heather
Young), microfinance and social protection interventions (Dr. Fred Ssewamala), economics and women’s
empowerment (Dr. Eve Namisango), and biostatistics (Dr. Xiaoming Sheng).
 There are an estimated 163 million children worldwide who are under the care of their grandparents or other
relatives. In Uganda, social determinants of health (i.e., poverty, wars, and maternal and perinatal conditions)
threaten the middle generation (age 15-49) and leave older adults, especially grandmothers (Bajjajja), to
become the safety net. Yet, in this region, knowledge about effective interventions that support the health and
wellbeing of these GMCs is limited to nonexistent. As such, Dr. Matovu proposes to refine, adapt, and test her
BAJJAJJA intervention. This will be achieved through three Specific Aims: 1) Refine and adapt the BAJJAJJA
intervention components through a collaborative and iterative feedback process with a diverse community
group of 18 members; 2) Test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the BAJJAJJA
intervention in improving economic and health outcomes among 24 Ugandan GMCs; and 3) Explore the
barriers and facilitators to (3a) maintenance of the BAJJAJJA individual intervention benefits and (3b)
sustainability of the income generating activity at 6 months post-intervention. This innovative study will be the
first in Uganda (to our knowledge) to utilize a community-engaged approach that emphasizes the meaningful
involvement of community partners to develop an intervention that targets GMCs. Her outcomes will support
her future efficacy clinical trial to test a novel multi-component and community-engaged BAJJAJJA intervention
to promote the mental, physical, and economic wellbeing of GMCs."

Sexual minority men (SMM) experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at alarming rates. Prior work has linked IPV
to sexual risk-taking behavior and increased risk for HIV seroconversion among SMM, but less is known about the
impact of IPV on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing/acquisition, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
uptake, and the persistence of PrEP use among SMM. While these findings reveal the potential for IPV to have a
strong deleterious effect on HIV prevention, experiences of IPV are so varied among SMM (e.g., frequency,
severity; steady vs. casual partnerships; mutual perpetration vs. only perpetrating or receiving violence; sexual vs.
physical vs. psychological violence) that additional research is needed to unpack the overall association between
IPV and HIV risk before effective interventions can be developed. Guided by a framework that combines the
Syndemics and Minority Stress theories, the proposed innovative observational cohort study will examine how
perpetration and/or receipt of various forms of IPV (e.g., physical, sexual, and psychological; in the context of
steady or casual intimate relationships) contribute to HIV risk and protective behaviors among HIV-negative SMM
over a 24-month timeframe in order to: 1. Examine the longitudinal associations of IPV with HIV testing, PrEP
uptake, PrEP persistence, STI diagnosis, condomless anal sex, and HIV seroconversion. 2. Determine the
structural- and individual-level and resilience and risk factors that may buffer or amplify associations between IPV
and these HIV risk and protective behaviors. 3. Identify the characteristics of SMM, their intimate partners, and the
relationship dynamics that serve to mediate the impact of IPV on HIV risk and protective behaviors. 4. Make
recommendations for interventions that interrupt the pathways between IPV and HIV risk based on quantitative data
from the cohort, and qualitative data guided by technical experts. We will assess sexual risk behavior, conduct HIV
and STI testing, and assess PrEP uptake and persistence over the 24 months of follow-up. We hypothesize that
greater frequency of IPV will be associated with history of childhood abuse, mental health problems, substance use,
sexual risk taking and lower levels of HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP persistence. We anticipate that alcohol
and substance use among participants and their partners will be highly associated with episodes of IPV (both
victimization and perpetration) and with HIV risk behavior. We also hypothesize that coping skills and social support
will mediate the effects of IPV on risk behavior, HIV testing, PrEP uptake, and PrEP persistence. The proposed
study will advance our understanding of both the risk and resiliency factors relevant to preventing and reducing IPV,
reducing IPV-associated risk behaviors, and increasing HIV protective behaviors among SMM. This research will
inform the development and adaptation of IPV, HIV, and substance abuse interventions for SMM."

My ongoing research (R01 MH118270) examines the efficacy of a digital health intervention to stabilize the 24-
hour rhythm of sleep, meals, and physical activity for reducing symptoms of depression in acutely-bereaved
older adults. The onset of COVID-19 in 2020 occurred in tandem with the start-up phase of this study. As a
result, I experienced significant setbacks because of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the recruitment of older
adults was significantly delayed (due to quarantine, social distancing, and participant concerns) and
enrollment did not start until January of 2021 – 17 months into the project period. This delay had cascading
effects on the study timeline and the feasibility of implementing a 15-month study in a newly-truncated project
period. Second, I was an Early-Stage Investigator (ESI) who experienced significant disruptions to the startup
of my independent research lab. Not only did I hire, train, and motivate staff in an uncertain and virtual
working environment, but my reduced level of productivity impacted future milestones in my career trajectory
(e.g., submission of new grants, development of new collaborations, and time to promotion). I exhausted all
other means to overcome COVID-19 setbacks for this study. For instance, I modified the intervention and study
protocol to be 100% contactless and virtual, and I expanded the reach of my intervention to geographic
locations across the United States. Since the start of enrollment in 2021, my study team has enrolled 87% of
our target sample and retained 91% of participants over the 15-month follow-up. I am confident in my team’s
ability to finish this study. However, the parent aims may not be achievable unless I can secure additional
funding to complete follow-up. In this administrative supplement, I propose to use additional funds for partial
salary support for my study staff to complete post-intervention follow-up for 45 individuals. The proposed
supplement aligns with NOT-MH-23 because (1) substantial components of the initial investment are at risk
(e.g., longitudinal data are required for the planned analyses) and (2) I was an ESI implementing my first
substantial research grant from the NIMH. This study is the first of its kind to test the effects of a circadian-
influenced behavioral intervention on reducing depression after the loss of a spouse/life partner – a distressing
albeit common life event in late life. Findings from this study will inform the development of widely
generalizable and scalable technology-based intervention to support bereaved persons in community-based
settings. However, additional funds are necessary to complete the project and collect post-intervention follow-
up data."
11063633,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Stigma adversely affects mental and physical health. Societal devaluation or mistreatment from others
can lead to internalization of stigma (i.e., self-stigma) among individuals with marginalized identities or traits.
Internalized stigma is robustly associated with impaired mental health and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL), often to a stronger degree than are interpersonal experiences of stigma (e.g., discrimination).
Experts have suggested that peer support or psychological counseling may help to reduce internalized stigma
and its associated health impacts, although very few studies have investigated such interventions.
 Health-related stigma is an umbrella term that encompasses negative judgment, blame, avoidance,
rejection, disparagement, discrimination, or dehumanization of individuals due to a health condition or disease.
Such health conditions may be visible (such as obesity, skin diseases, or cancers that result in disfigurement),
or concealable (such as HIV, diabetes, or chronic pain). Patients who internalize health-related stigma report
avoidance of health care settings and disengagement from disease management behaviors, in addition to
showing signs of physiological stress. Thus, health-related stigma compounds disease burden and threatens
HRQOL beyond the direct effects of the health conditions themselves. Prior research on health-related stigma
has been siloed, such that studies investigate one type of stigma, its effects, and possible solutions in isolation
from stigma due to other health conditions. Consistent evidence of stigma’s harms on mental and physical
health across health conditions, and shared theoretical foundations for intervention development, indicate the
need for a unifying approach. An intervention that reduces internalized stigma among individuals with varying
health conditions would have broad impact and would shift the paradigm of how stigma is currently addressed.
 The current project seeks to determine the effects of a novel, transdiagnostic, group-based counseling
intervention designed to help patients cope with and to reduce the internalization of health-related stigma. An
intervention and a self-report measure that were previously developed to address only one form of health-
related stigma will be adapted to generalize to patients of other health conditions. After piloting, a randomized
controlled trial will be conducted to test the effects of the group-based counseling intervention on internalized
stigma, mental health, and HRQOL. The counseling condition (which also includes peer support) will be
compared to a general peer support group and a waitlist control group. Participants will be 195 men and
women who report high levels of internalized stigma due to their health condition. All study procedures will be
conducted online, including assessments and treatment. Participants in the counseling and peer support
groups will receive 12 weekly group sessions, followed by 2 every-other-week and 2 monthly sessions, for a
total of 26 weeks. Findings from this study will provide new insights into the most effective and efficient method
for reducing internalized stigma, and improving HRQOL, in patients with a wide array of health conditions."

Impaired wound healing after radiation therapy is a major clinical challenge in the management of oncologic
patients. The efficacy of radiotherapy in cancer treatment is often accompanied by the disruption of biological
pathways underlying the wound repair process, with considerable side effects represented by skin injuries and
ulcers. At the same time, the need for complete wound healing after a surgical procedure could delay the
administration of radiotherapy, essential for cancer remission, posing a potential threat to patients’ survival.
Current clinical practice is limited to conservative management of irradiated wounds, without targeting the
pathogenesis of impaired wound healing after radiation. Fibroplate has conceived Fibrinoplate-S (FPS), a
solution based on intravenously injectable Fibrinogen-coated Albumin nano Spheres (FAS) with a unique
multivalent potential to accelerate chronic wound healing in multiple soft tissues. Previous studies showed that
FPS can accelerate the healing of Radiation Skin injuries by promoting mobilization of progenitor cells of various
lineages including Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs), and by regulating the levels of several cytokines involved
in inflammatory states. By taking advantage of this knowledge, Fibroplate Inc. proposes to perform the first
preclinical assessment of FPS efficacy to accelerate the healing of the surgical wound in oncologic patients
undergoing radiotherapy. If confirmed, FPS could shorten the time window between surgery and RT by improving
surgical wound healing with a positive impact on cancer treatment. In this SBIR Phase I project Fibroplate aims
to achieve two objectives. 1) Demonstrate the ability of FPS to promote surgical wound healing after
radiotherapy. A murine orthotopic metastatic breast cancer model will be used to mimic human breast cancer
progression and treatment including mastectomy procedures. Wound closure and strength, cytokine panel, and
degree of neovascularization will be assessed. The same model will also serve as validation of FPS’ mode of
action. In particular, Fibroplate will validate the ability of FPS to induce mobilization of progenitor cells, which will
confirm that the mode of action of FPS is not affected by the cancer environment. 2) Assess FPS’ safety profile
on mice with a preliminary evaluation of its impact on coagulation parameters, and evaluation of health
parameters including body weight and residual tumor mass (if any). This work will be preparatory of a Phase II
project, where Fibroplate aims to perform additional IND-enabling studies to further characterize FPS’ dosing,
efficacy, and safety profile in mice and minipigs cancer models."

Pregestational diabetes induces neural tube defects (NTDs), the second most common birth defects. We and
others have shown that cellular stress, altered cell fate and epigenetic and non-coding RNA alterations are
critically involved in diabetic embryopathy. How neuroepithelial cell fate is altered by non-coding RNAs in diabetic
pregnancy is obscure. We showed that restoring miR-322 expression suppressed by maternal diabetes
ameliorated neuroepithelial cell apoptosis and NTDs, revealed that the RNA binding protein RBM47 was a miR-
322 target, and found that exosomes from vascular Flk1 positive progenitors specifically targeted neuroepithelial
cells during neurulation. Exosomal delivery of the RBM47-expressing DNA vector to embryos resulted in NTDs.
RBM47 binds to the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), NEAT1, to stabilize it. Exosome-mediated delivery of NEAT1
to embryos induces NTDs. Thus, we hypothesize that maternal diabetes dysregulates RNA metabolism by
repressing miR-322, upregulating RBM47 and stabilizing NEAT1 in the neuroepithelium. Restoring miR-
322 or deleting either Rbm47 or Neat1 attenuates neuroepithelial cell apoptosis, senescence,
neurogenesis impairment and NTD formation. miR-322 deletion or overexpressing either Rbm47 or Neat1
mimics diabetes to alter cell fate and induce NTDs. To test our hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims.
Aim 1 will determine whether miR-322 is essential for neurulation and its reduction contributes to maternal
diabetes-induced neuroepithelial cell dysfunction and NTD formation. We hypothesize that maternal
diabetes-repressed miR-322 causes senescence and inhibits neurogenesis by altering gene expression in spatial
and cell-type specific manners in the neuroepithelium. Aim 2 will investigate whether increased RBM47
mediates the teratogenicity of diabetes by affecting neuroepithelial cell fates leading to NTD formation.
Our hypothesis is that miR-322 targets RBM47 for degradation and maternal diabetes increases RBM47
expression by repressing miR-322, and that RBM47 conditional deletion in the neuroepithelium ameliorates
neuroepithelial cell fate alteration and NTD formation in diabetic pregnancy. Aim 3 will determine whether
increased NEAT1 mediates the teratogenic effect of maternal diabetes by altering neuroepithelial cell
function and ultimately promoting NTD formation. We hypothesize that maternal diabetes increases NEAT1
via RBM47-mediated stabilization and that NEAT1 deficiency reverses neuroepithelial cell fate alterations and
blocks NTDs in diabetic embryopathy. Alteration in miRNA, RNA binding protein, and lncRNA alterations are
involved in human NTDs. Revealing this mechanism in linking miRNA to lncRNA via RBM47 is a novel epigenetic
regulation in diabetic embryopathy."

The larger goal of the project is to identify infection-dependent weaknesses of Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens that could be exploited chemically. We focus on the human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and its survival within mammalian cells and use cell culture infection models
and small molecules as tools. We and others have observed that some small molecules that are not effective
against Gram-negative bacteria in media prevent pathogen survival during infection of cells and animals.
Gram-negative bacteria likely become vulnerable during infection to small molecules because a variety of host
innate immune mechanisms permeabilize the bacterial cell envelope and/or occupy efflux pumps, enabling
compounds to reach a periplasmic or cellular target. When laboratory media imitates host innate immunity by
permeabilizing the outer membrane, these compounds inhibit bacterial growth. We have identified small
molecules that under broth conditions that permeabilize the outer membrane or in protoplasts, dissipate
bacterial inner membrane voltage without physically disrupting the lipid bilayer. Membrane voltage disruption
could compromise bacteria by, for instance, interfering with energy production and/or activating stress-
response signaling. The compounds do not disrupt mammalian membranes at concentrations that kill S.
Typhimurium in macrophages and at least one of the compounds reduces tissue colonization in mice,
demonstrating in vivo potential for this approach. The Specific Aims will interrogate five distinct molecule
classes to determine whether targeting the inner membrane should be pursued as a novel approach to fighting
Gram-negative bacterial infections."

Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a major clinical challenge due to their poor response to therapeutic
options. Although the survival rate of breast cancer (BC) patients has improved, the incidence of BCBM is
increasing with recent advance in diagnostic imaging and systemic therapy, and long-term survival rates for
these patients are unacceptably low, urgently calling for new interventions. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1
(oHSV) therapy is the most advanced virotherapy as approved by FDA for melanoma in the U.S. and
conditionally for glioblastoma in Japan. However, accumulating clinical data is revealing that oHSV treatment
very weakly induces a systemic anti-tumor immune response which is often offset by the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, mechanistic identification of the anti-viral resistance is a key to maximize
its therapeutic efficacy. In BCBM, we observed that oHSV therapy induces insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)
expression and secretion, sustaining pro-inflammatory neutrophils in the TME and polarization change to pro-
tumoral neutrophils, hampering the virus propagation and discouraging the development of a strong adaptive
anti-tumoral immune response. Additionally, we found that infiltrated neutrophils by oHSV therapy induces
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (also called “NETosis”), hampering the therapeutic efficiency of
Viro-Immunotherapy. The overarching goal of this application is to identify the ultimate cause of the poor clinical
response of cancer patients to oHSV therapy, and develop a more effective novel viral immunotherapy for
incurable BCBM. We aim to achieve our goal by deciphering anti-viral resistance mechanism behind oHSV-
induced IGF2/microglia/neutrophil axis, and evaluating therapeutic benefit of IGF2 inhibition and NET
degradation on oHSV therapy. To compromise oHSV-induced IGF2 and its signaling pathways, we generated a
novel IGF2-scavanging oHSV (oHSV-D11mt) and will investigate the therapeutic benefit when combined with
radiation therapy, which has also been hindered by IGF2, neutrophil infiltration and NETosis. We also generated
actin resistant DNase1-expressing oHSV (oHSV-haDNase1) to degrade the NETs for enhanced virus
propagation and access to infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes. To test these hypotheses, we will investigate the
contradictory roles of IGF2 in virus clearance and tumor progression (Aim 1), evaluate therapeutic potential of
IGF2-scavenging oHSV-D11mt in combination with radiotherapy (Aim 2), and assess the preclinical efficacy of
NET-mitigating oHSV-haDNase1 (Aim 3). The successful completion of this proposed study is expected to unveil
the role of neutrophil infiltration and NET formation induced by oHSV therapy, and elucidate why oHSV therapy
was not as successful as viral immunotherapy as expected. Therefore, it will accelerate the translation of oHSV
therapy into an efficient and improved treatment modality for the patients with BCBM."
11058701,"Mammals harbor hundreds of bacterial species in the gut that are deeply integrated with their
hosts’ metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine systems. Before birth, mammals lack a defined
gut microbiota, which must be assembled anew in each host generation. Individuals acquire
their first inoculum from the mother during birth and are subsequently colonized throughout life
by bacteria from the external environment, including social contacts. However, the modes by
which specific gut bacterial lineages are transmitted between hosts remain poorly understood. It
currently remains unknown which, if any, gut bacterial lineages are faithfully inherited within
mammalian host lineages over multiple generations. Similarly, the relative contributions of
horizontal transmission through social interactions and shared environments are unclear.
Furthermore, the underlying genetic bases of bacterial transmission phenotypes have not been
discovered. Resolving these knowledge gaps is of critical significance for understanding the full
complement of genetic material inherited within mammalian lineages, the evolution of symbiosis
between gut bacteria and mammalian species, the community assembly of the gut microbiota
within individual mammals, and the spread of bacterial enteropathogens within mammalian
populations. Here, we propose to identify vertically and horizontally transmitted members of the
mouse gut microbiota (Aim 1) and to discover the genetic bases of gut bacterial transmission
phenotypes (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will employ an innovative experimental system that utilizes
wild-derived outbred populations of mice reared in outdoor enclosures to disentangle the modes
of transmission within the gut microbiota. As part of this work, we will also develop new
approaches for assembling high-quality bacterial genomes from metagenomes that will provide
unprecedented opportunities to study dispersal of bacteria. In Aim 2, we will employ transposon-
insertion sequencing of gut bacterial lineages that disperse within and between germ-free
mouse lines reared in gnotobiotic isolators in order to identify the specific genes that underlie
gut bacterial transmission phenotypes. This work will focus on both vertically and horizontally
transmitted bacterial lineages identified by our previous work as well as by results of Aim 1.
Determining the genetic basis of gut bacterial transmission within and between mammalian
lineages has the potential to reshape understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of
bacterial dispersal strategies. In addition, Aim 2 will contribute substantially to the development
of functional genomics tools in mammalian gut bacteria. Cumulatively, the proposed work will
yield fundamental insights into the modes of gut bacterial transmission in mammals."
11053757,"Summary: Substantial reductions in brain blood flow are found in patients with and mouse models of
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Vascular pathologies are prevalent in an aging
population and patients with AD. Despite their importance, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and
dementia (VCID) and the interaction with AD are understudied. We have previously shown that neutrophils block
blood vessels and contribute to blood flow reductions and cognitive decline in mouse models of AD. However,
there is a knowledge gap on how and when neutrophils change and become activated, thus driving
interactions with the microvasculature to cause neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.
We hypothesize that neutrophils become activated by hypoperfusion and AD pathology causing neutrophil-
vascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration; this is likely exacerbated in mixed forms of AD. Aim1 will use
longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging to determine how and when neutrophils become reactive. We will also
characterize cerebral blood flow, capillary stalling, neutrophil behavior, blood-brain barrier permeability, and
vascular inflammation in a VCID, AD, and mixed AD mouse model. In Aim 2, we will utilize single-cell sequencing
of neutrophils to determine whether certain neutrophils become more reactive in our disease models, and
whether disease-associated neutrophil subpopulations drive disease progression. Furthermore, we will elucidate
the molecular mechanisms that drive neutrophil changes, focusing on metabolism and glycosylation. Last, we
will functionally test if neutrophils can be stopped from being activated and slow down disease progression.
In summary, we will determine how hypoperfusion and AD pathology lead to changes in neutrophil reactivity and
how such changes contribute to microvascular damage. We expect this work to lead to the identification of
disease stage-specific biomarkers and shed light on the contribution of activated neutrophils to VCID and mixed
AD."
11059702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gene expression, the flow of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) to protein,
involves delicate regulation by a group of small RNAs named microRNAs. MicroRNAs can inhibit gene
expression by binding to mRNAs and prevent them from being translated into proteins. MicroRNA
levels in cancer cells are usually different from the microRNA levels in healthy cells, leading to
differential expression of certain cancer-related genes. Controlling microRNA levels therefore offers a
promising target for cancer treatment.
Recently, we found that when T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are treated with
dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid steroid commonly used in leukemia chemotherapy, two highly related
and pro-cancer microRNAs (miR-221/222) are degraded by their target mRNA (BIM). This is surprising
because microRNAs usually control the levels of their targets, but not the other way around. This is also
exciting because it represents an emerging gene regulation mode carried out by the mRNAs and opens
up strategies for cancer intervention.
In this proposal, we first aim to understand how BIM mRNA triggers miR-221/222 degradation. Our
second aim is to explore how miR-221/222 degradation enhances killing of T-ALL cells during
chemotherapy. In the final aim, we will develop an innovative biochemical and computational protocol to
globally identify sequences in different target mRNAs that can induce miRNA degradation in T-ALL
patient samples.
Collectively, our efforts will examine a new mechanism of gene regulation in T-ALL, in which mRNAs
counteract microRNAs. Because resistance to glucocorticoid is a serious limitation for T-ALL
chemotherapy, elucidating the underlying mechanism of resistance may provide the basis for improving
current therapeutic interventions. Given that we have discovered a potentially widespread occurrence
of the mRNA-induced microRNA degradation pathway in cancer, identifying the mRNAs that can
degrade miRNAs and the proteins involved in this process would help develop new therapies to combat
T-ALL."
11059705,"Summary/Abstract
The use of antibiotics has significantly increased in recent years. Antibiotics (ABX) severely alter the
gut microbiome, destroying potentially pathogenic bacteria, as well as beneficial ones—producing a
state of microbial imbalance called dysbiosis. Notably, a diminished gut microbiome has severe defects on
the immune system, yet how these defects may affect cellular immunotherapy is largely unknown.
 To better understand how dysbiosis influences cellular immunotherapy, we focused on melanoma as
an exemplary immunogenic solid tumor. The incidence of melanoma has increased drastically over the
past decades, with its morbidity rate continuing to outpace that of most other cancers. Early stages of
melanoma are often successfully controlled and treated; yet patients with advanced stages of melanoma are
treated with cellular immunotherapy and only 50% respond. We hypothesize that ABX-induced dysbiosis
dictates, at least in part, the reduction in treatment efficacy.
 Our overall goal is to define the systemic effects of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the distal
tumor microenvironment and develop therapies to promote antitumor immunity. The major
objective of this application is to overcome dysbiosis-induced ICAM-1 suppression and thereby enhance
the effectiveness of cellular immunotherapy. Attaining this objective will be the next step in increasing the
efficacy and response rate of immunotherapies. We formulated a robust and unbiased approach using
various melanoma models to accomplish the following Aims:
Aim 1. Identify ABX primarily responsible for stromal immune suppression resulting in tumor progression.
Aim 2. Increase ICAM-1 on tumor-associated endothelial cells during dysbiosis.
Aim 3. Increase cellular immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma during dysbiosis.
 Completing these aims will expand our understanding on how antibiotics-induced perturbation of the
gut microbiome impacts the distal tumor microenvironment. This work has the potential to establish new
paradigms aimed at enhancing the efficacy and response rate of immunotherapies by modulating the
tumor vasculature, as all types of immunotherapy ultimately dependent on efficient trafficking of effector
leukocytes into the tumor."
11059008,"Our nation is experiencing historic rates of drug overdose deaths that has left behind millions of bereaved families. People who are bereaved by overdose experience a “special grief” that includes guilt, shame, and blame for their loved one’s death that often compounds suffering and help-seeking. People bereaved by drug overdose experience more negative health consequences than those grieving non-drug related deaths (i.e., prolonged grief disorder, substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicidal ideation). Overdose bereavement is common, especially among people who use drugs who may experience increases in risky substance use while grieving. Overdose deaths have a ripple effect and may increase risk for overdose morbidity and mortality among the bereaved. Peer grief support interventions hold promise for those who are grieving and may be especially important for this population because of the increased stigma, isolation, and risks this population faces. In a novel practice-research partnership, we partner with Peer Community Support Partners (PSCP) who has developed the RIVER peer grief support model for drug overdose bereavement, a promising practice that has been implemented successfully in the community, but has not yet been rigorously tested. This study seeks to not only understand whether a peer support intervention aids those grieving an overdose, but it also proactively engages and connects grievers to resources through medical examiner offices (MEOs) who contact family as part of their standard practice with death investigations. In Aim 1 (R61), through collaboration with PSCP, three MEOs, and our three advisory boards, we will adapt the RIVER training materials to our local communities, refine intervention fidelity measures, and develop intervention and MEO recruitment workflows. In Aim 2 (R61), we will conduct a pilot test with overdose bereaved participants to evaluate if we can engage participants through MEOs, measure RIVER fidelity, and evaluate if RIVER is acceptable to participants. In Aim 3 (R33), we will conduct an RCT to
evaluate the effectiveness of RIVER to enhanced usual care. Participants will be recruited from MEOs and will complete baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month surveys. Post-RCT qualitative interviews will supplement data collection and will allow us to understand the characteristics that drive intervention effectiveness. We will also explore how RIVER facilitators’ well-being is affected by intervention delivery using a mixed quantitative and qualitative approach. The proposed research represents a significant step towards understanding and supporting a community that has been too long overlooked. By marrying community and research expertise, this partnership aims to build the science of overdose bereavement and provide increased support for those affected by this tragic issue.

Aminoglycosides (AG) have broad antibiotic spectra against aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria 
and mycobacterial pathogens. AG toxicities include kidney tubular necrosis, vertigo, and, most notably, hearing 
loss. Regarding the use of AG in mycobacterial infections, they are used to treat multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) infected patients with cystic fibrosis 
(or other structural lung disorders). Studies have shown that 55-58% of patients infected with MDR-TB who 
received amikacin as part of their therapy, experienced hearing loss due to its ototoxic effects. Likewise, up to 
27% of patients with cystic fibrosis infected with M. abscessus who received aminoglycoside therapy 
experienced hearing loss. To date, there is no FDA-approved method or therapy available to prevent or 
treat hearing loss. Reduced reliance on aminoglycoside use in mycobacterial infections should minimize 
hearing loss risk for patients infected with drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) strains and 
nontuberculous (NTM) mycobacteria. 
We have discovered a novel series of small molecules (indole-2-carboxamides and acetamides) that have potent 
activity against a panel of mycobacteria. Two of our lead candidates had poor oral absorption yet achieved 
efficacy in a mouse model of M. abscessus infection. Therefore, we propose to discover and develop antimycobacterial 
inhibitors with potent activity with improved pharmacokinetic profiles and no ototoxicity. This will 
be accomplished using ligand-based drug design and computer aided drug design. In vitro bioavailability and 
toxicity profiles will also be determined for the inhibitors. Finally, potent anti-NTM agents with optimized 
bioavailability and toxicity profiles will be subjected to macromolecular mechanism of action studies, ensuring 
future compounds remain on target as Mycobacterial membrane protein Large 3 (MmpL3) inhibitors."

This is an application for a diversity supplement award for Dr. Pilar Hernandez-Con, a doctoral student in the
Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy, College of Pharmacy, at University of Florida (UF). Dr.
Hernandez-Con aims to establish herself as a health services researcher specializing in studying the syndemic
of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and substance use disorders (SUDs). This
diversity supplement award aims to provide Dr. Hernandez-Con with the necessary support to: (1) enhance her
understanding and expertise of social determinants of health (SDoH) influencing the HCV/HIV syndemic among
individuals with SUDs; (2) gain training in natural language processing (NLP) methodologies to extract clinically
meaningful data from unstructured clinical notes; and (3) improve her grant writing skills leading to the
submission of a K99/R00 grant before the end of the support period. To achieve these goals, Dr. Hernandez-
Con will collaborate with an interdisciplinary mentoring team, including primary mentor, Dr. Haesuk Park, the
principal investigator of the parent grant and an expert in HCV and HIV infections among vulnerable populations,
along with co-mentors Dr. Jingchuan Serena Guo, an epidemiologist specializing in SDoH and EHR; Dr. Amie
Goodin, an expert in health policy and SUDs; and Dr. Yonghui Wu, a computer scientist with expertise in NLP
applied to EHR data. Dr. Robert L. Cook, a primary care physician and researcher specializing in HIV and SUDs,
will serve as her career development advisor.
The opioid crisis in the United States has resulted in a sharp increase in HCV and HIV infections among
individuals with SUD, yet a significant proportion remain unaware of their infections, contributing to further
transmission. Dr. Hernandez-Con’s proposed study will focus on identifying important SDoH affecting the
HCV/HIV/SUD syndemic. This proposal has two specific aims: (1) developing and validating a polysocial risk
score (PsRS) utilizing NLP methods and UF Health EHR data to comprehensively assess SDoH that influence
HCV infection and HCV/HIV co-infection; and (2) developing and validating an algorithm to predict the risk of
HCV infection and HCV/HIV co-infection, comparing its performance to algorithms with and without PsRS
alongside demographic and clinical characteristics. The insights gained from this study will inform effective
implementation strategies for healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers. They will also serve as the
foundation for future research to better understand the role of SDoH in the HCV/HIV syndemic and health
outcomes in vulnerable populations particularly individuals with SUDs."

My lab seeks to define the molecular logic of complex cell behaviors— how cells go from sets of interacting
molecules to the emergent properties of living systems. We currently focus on three questions: how
neutrophils control their shape and movement, how lymphocytes detect rare foreign peptides in a sea of self-
peptides, and how mouse embryonic stem cells regulate transcriptional activation. Studying a diversity of cell
types and behaviors makes it easier to identify the general principles of cellular decision-making beyond the
particulars of a given system. And it opens up more interfaces for cross pollination between different projects
in the lab. Transformative science often happens at interfaces, so we seek to borrow tools and concepts from
other fields to address open questions in cell biology and frequently develop new tools when they are needed
to accelerate progress. For instance, optogenetics enables us to plug into defined signaling nodes and test the
logic of subcircuits in a manner that circumvents the feedback, redundancy, and compensation that confound
investigation with standard approaches. Our most common strategy is to pair biosensors for visualizing the
quantitative dynamics of these processes in living cells with precision tools to control the regulators of these
behaviors. For cell migration, we are breaking down the complex process of directed movement into its
fundamental pieces—how a cell decides to initiate a protrusion, how the shape of the protrusion is specified,
how the protrusions compete with one another to enable cell polarity, and how this process is biased by
external gradients. For T cell activation, we are investigating how cells convert small differences in antigen
binding to large changes in cell activation by leveraging a light-responsive T cell antigen. Finally, we are
investigating the logic of transcriptional activation—in particular how enhancers activate promoters and how
transcription factor dynamics specifies the pattern of gene activation."

Currently, the Draize live rabbit eye test is the benchmark to distinguish consumer products and materials that
are safe from those that are hazardous and can cause mild, moderate, or severe ocular damage. However,
new laws are currently being, or are planned to be, implemented in California, the United States, and the
European Union to ban the use of animals for ocular irritation testing. Despite this fact, there is currently no
single nonanimal test or combination of nonanimal tests that can accurately classify all levels of ocular irritants
and corrosives. It is of particular concern that all nonanimal tests generally overpredict the least damaging
class of ocular irritants and cannot determine (or determine with low sensitivity) the most extreme class for
which they have sensitivity rates as low as 50%. More importantly, none of the currently validated alternative
tests can detect irritants that require proper safety labeling (GHS Cat. 2A) or those that cause irritation that
lasts up to 21 days but then clears without causing permanent corneal damage. This target classification
represents a critical UNMET NEED for correctly informing and advising consumers and manufacturers about
product safety. We have recently developed and tested a new method, the in vitro depth of injury eye irritation
test (IVD EIT), to detect all classes of irritants with high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this
application is to further develop the IVD EIT with the long-term goal of providing a service and/or kit for the
accurate classification of ocular irritants to meet this UNMET NEED for a nonanimal ocular irritation test to be
used to label product and chemicals and hence ensure safe handling practices.

11080441,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age is one of the most clearly defined risk factors for cancer. As the incidence of cancer increases with age,
rising more rapidly beginning in mid-life (ages 45-64 years), cancer can be considered an age-related disease.
Recent studies have identified age-dependent somatic mutations, including alleles with a role in cancer initiation,
in a spectrum of human tissues. In the hematopoietic system this is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and is
most commonly caused by mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 within the
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. How the aging process promotes clonal selection,
expansion, and transformation from CH to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly understood. The long-term
goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which aging promotes transformation causing
hematologic malignancies. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which
increased inflammation observed during aging promotes expansion of CH-mutant HSPCs, and the extent to
which this fitness advantage is provided by altered epigenetic regulation occurring as a direct consequence of
CH mutations. Preliminary data show that CH-mutant HSPCs have a more potent selective advantage and
undergo more rapid malignant transformation in aged compared to young mice. Mechanistically, increased
inflammation in aged mice is a driver of this phenotype and epigenetic alterations are found to accumulate in
CH-mutant HSPCs with aging. These data support the central hypothesis that aging-associated inflammation is
a selective pressure favoring CH-mutant HSPC expansion and malignant transformation, and that clonal
expansion, epigenetic alterations, and risk of transformation caused by CH mutations are dependent upon
sustained CH-mutant allele expression. This project will use cellular and molecular biological approaches in aged
mice integrated with studies using primary human CH samples to achieve the following specific aims: AIM 1.
Determine the extent to which clonal hematopoietic expansion and leukemic transformation in the aging context
is due to inflammation; and AIM 2. Determine the mechanisms by which, and extent to which, reversion of a CH
mutation during aging alters clonal evolution and risk of leukemia initiation. The proposed research is
conceptually innovative because it is the first to determine how inflammation and epigenetic dysregulation
conspire during the aging process to expand, evolve and transform CH-mutant clones. The proposed research
is technically innovative as it incorporates novel co-culture systems and therapeutic studies to assess key
inflammatory drivers, as well as a novel murine model with CH-mutant induction and reversion capabilities to
investigate CH mutant allele dependencies in clonal expansion, epigenetic alterations, and leukemic
transformation. This study is significant because understanding the mechanisms by which aging contributes to
clonal expansion and transformation will provide insights into effective therapeutic strategies targeting clonal
evolution, attenuate pathophysiology promoted by clonal expansion, and intercept malignant transformation."
11080522,"Summary/Abstract of the diversity supplement to the parent project.
Despite recent advances in the understanding host-microbiome interactions in the pathogenesis of Inflammatory
Bowel Diseases (IBD), the complexity of the host’s response to changing gut microbiota is daunting and still
incompletely understood. In this proposal, we show that poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation), a post-translational
modification that involves the enzymatic transfer of ADP-ribose (ADPr) from NAD+ to specific amino acids of
target proteins, plays key roles as a mediator of inflammatory response in the gut. In the parent proposal, we
provided evidence that PARP1 is the primary PAR writer in the colon, where it serves as a powerful
transcriptional modulator. Commensal bacteria are necessary for mucosal PARP1 activity and PARylation and,
reciprocally, PARP1 controls the microbial composition and metabolic activity, modulates colonic epithelial
barrier function, and restricts the mucosal Treg compartment. Importantly, human and murine colitis is associated
with mucosal hyperPARylation, which can be transferred to germ-free mice with complex microbial community
from IBD patients. Total or epithelial-specific knockout of PARP1 (or pharmacological inhibition) protect from
and promote recovery from mucosal injury. In this administrative supplement, the work conducted by Ms.
Catherine Ellis, PhD candidate in the Kiela lab, further expands these findings and describes the screening
process using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of stool samples from healthy and IBD patients,
and the identification of protein and lipid fraction as responsible for hyperPARylation in the colonic epithelium.
Among lipid luminal metabolites, fecal lactosylceramide (highly elevated in IBD samples and described by others
as a reliable marker of IBD) appears to be the key driver of hyperPARylation in the inflamed gut. Based on these
novel preliminary observations, we expand our hypothesis and plan to test the following:
1. Define the role of lactosylceramide and related sphingolipids in promoting epithelial hyperPARylation.
2. Mechanistically define the PARylation-dependent effects of lactosylceramide on epithelial cell dysfunction
under inflammatory stress."

Immune therapy in cancer has made great strides in the past decade. However, not all tumor types benefit from
current therapies. Additionally overcoming resistance to both targeted and immune therapy for second- or third-
line therapies remains a critical challenge for all cancers. Developing experimental models to advance new
immune therapy strategies has faced impediments, hindering progress. Most studies require clinical trials for
even minor advancements in approaches, protocols, timing, dosage, and sequential treatments. Our laboratory
has developed a new experimental model of immune cell-tumor interactions that will fill an important gap in
immune oncology investigations because it is: i) autologous, as immune and tumor cells are derived from the
same patients; and ii) reproducible, as tumor cells and iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells have unlimited
growth capacities. The source of melanoma cells are the patients’ lesions, which are maintained as PDX (patient-
derived xenografts), organoids, or cell lines. iPS cells are conveniently derived from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells or normal fibroblasts. Three cell types, monocytes, pre-T cells and thymic epithelial cells, are
independently developed from the same iPS cultures. The monocytes are loaded with tumor antigens (tumor
cells, extracts, proteins, or peptides), acting as antigen presenting cells. When the three cell types are placed
together as thymic organoids, the T cells mature and appear stable and can be expanded. The first aim proposes
to investigate T cell receptor diversity and achieving tumor specificity. The second aim characterizes tumor cell-T
cell interactions and how the system can be used to overcome resistance to both checkpoint inhibitors and
targeted therapies. We plan to develop melanoma cell-iPS cell pairs from patients resistant to checkpoint
inhibitors including anti-PD1 and/or CTLA4 and those who are resistant to both targeted and immune checkpoint
therapies. We will then develop complex organoids with stromal and immune cells to mimic tumor-T cell
interactions within an intact microenvironment. Finally, we will transfer the in vitro model to an in vivo setting
using our extensive experience in humanizing mice.
Furthering our on-going collaboration with NCI’s Patient-Derived Models Repository (PDMR) will enable us to
expand the technology and conduct critical research aimed at developing new approaches to overcome therapy
resistance. Moreover, this collaboration will allow for sharing our new models with the scientific community and
extending this innovative approach from melanoma to other malignancies.

11051634,"Project Summary
Progress against pediatric solid tumors has stalled. Current standard therapies largely employ dose intensive
cytotoxic agents developed in the 1970s and 1980s that incur severe lifelong toxicity and are unable to cure most
patients with high-risk, metastatic, recurrent or refractory disease. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common
malignant brain tumor of childhood epitomizes this reality, since standard therapies are exceedingly toxic and
outcomes for patients with metastatic, recurrent or refractory disease remain poor. There is an urgent need for
novel, effective targeted therapies for MB. Cerebroglycan (GPC-2) is overexpressed on the cell surface of MB
and is not expressed on normal postnatal tissues rendering it a compelling target for treatment with chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) based therapies. CAR based therapies have shown impressive activity in B-cell and
plasma cell malignancies, and early signals of activity have been observed with GD2-CAR T cells in children
with diffuse midline glioma and neuroblastoma respectively, providing evidence that CAR T cells can mediate
significant activity in pediatric brain tumors and solid tumors. In stringent preclinical models, we demonstrated
that an iteratively optimized GPC2-CAR mediated significant antitumor activity in MB and NB, but also observed
late disease recurrence associated with GPC2 downmodulation. Leveraging deep expertise in enhancing the
potency of CAR T cells in the Mackall lab, we demonstrated that overexpression of cJUN in GPC2-CAR T cells
led to improved long-term disease control against MB and NB without evidence for toxicity. These data align
directly with studies from our lab and others demonstrating that cJUN overexpression lowers the antigen density
required for CAR T cell activation, diminishes T cell exhaustion and enhances T cell persistence. Aims 1 and 2
of this Project will define the optimal approach to overexpress cJUN in GPC2-CAR T cells at clinical scale testing
state-of-the-art approaches to co-transduction, viral free gene integration and cell selection to identify the most
efficient and reproductible platform for consistently delivering an optimized clinical GPC2.cJUN-CAR product. In
Aim 3 we will apply the optimal process to manufacture clinical grade GPC2.cJUN-CAR T cells in Arm B of a
Phase I trial designed to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of GPC2.cJUN-CAR T cell therapy against
MB. This trial will compare outcomes between patients treated with GPC2-CAR T cells that did not overexpress
cJUN who will have previously been enrolled on Arm A. This work will be among the first to test a potency
enhanced CAR T cell therapy for pediatric cancer, will provide valuable information about the promise of GPC2
as a target for MB and will provide preliminary evidence regarding whether cJUN OE can enhance CAR T cell
potency without incurring significant toxicity in humans."

long-term goal is to conduct high-impact clinical studies and implementation research to improve detection and
treatment of TB and other infectious diseases in children living in low-income countries. This award will provide
the candidate with five years of mentored research and career development time, and he will spend >50% of
the award period based at Kamuzu University of Health Sciences (KUHeS) and KUHeS affiliate Malawi
Liverpool Wellcome Clinical Research Program in Blantyre, Malawi. The candidate’s primary mentors for this
award are Dr. Henry Mwandumba (Primary LMIC-based Mentor) and Dr. Karl Seydel (Primary US Mentor). Dr.
Mwandumba will provide excellent mentorship in the area of his expertise, implementing TB clinical studies in
this setting. Dr. Seydel brings a wealth of experience conducting high-impact pediatric clinical studies in
Blantyre and will provide guidance in this area. Through a combination of mentorship, coursework, and
practical experiences, the candidate proposes to develop expertise in the following key areas: leadership and
implementation of pediatric clinical research in Malawi; advanced study design (including clinical trials) and
statistical methods; and 3) pharmacokinetic study design and analysis. This training plan will coincide with, and
complement, a rigorous research plan. The proposed research focuses on TB in children under five years old
(U5s), an age group with unacceptably and disproportionately high mortality from TB. The large “case finding
gap” in this age group is a major problem globally and largely a consequence of the lack of TB diagnostic tools
that are both practical and accurate in U5s. There is also a knowledge gap regarding the effect of co-prevalent
SAM on the pharmacokinetics of first-line antituberculosis therapy in U5s. For Aim 1 of the proposal, we plan
conduct a prospective cohort study to evaluate the accuracy of promising new TB diagnostic strategies that
utilize non-invasively collected specimens (stool and urine) in hospitalized Malawian U5s with presumed
pulmonary TB. For Aim 2 of the proposal, we plan to longitudinally characterize the pharmacokinetics of first-
line antituberculosis therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) in Malawian U5s with co-
prevalent SAM and TB as they recover from both diseases. This research will provide valuable insights into the
diagnosis and management of TB in U5s and put the candidate in excellent position to secure independent
research funding for more in-depth investigations in this setting in the areas of diagnostics and
pharmacokinetics for pediatric TB and other infectious diseases that plague underserved children."
11073136,"Despite current therapies and prevention measures, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience a
disproportionately higher risk of cardiovascular events due to a more severe and accelerated atherosclerotic
burden present in vessels, a longer duration of diabetes exposure, and often asymptomatic early disease that
can lead to sudden cardiac death as the first manifestation of disease compared to patients with type 2
diabetes (T2D) or those without diabetes. Moreover, established lesions in the presence of T1D are more
resistant to therapeutic strategies (diet or pharmacologic lipid-lowering) that normally facilitate plaque
regression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel therapies to reduce the development of T1D-
associated atherosclerosis that can lead to cardiovascular sequelae. Current paradigms suggest that chronic
inflammation coupled with sustained endothelial inflammatory responses, altered macrophage chemotactic and
efferocytotic functions, and accumulation of senescent cells may be critical links to the accelerated lesion
progression and impaired regression with T1D. Therefore, targeting these processes in the vessel wall may
provide a novel therapeutic approach to limit atherosclerotic progression and facilitate regression. However,
significant gaps remain in the molecular underpinnings that regulate T1D-associated atherosclerotic
pathobiology with limited studies derived from human coronary arteries. A large portion of the non-coding
genome is actively transcribed and constitute microRNAs (miRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
Studies from our laboratory have uncovered novel cell-specific roles for a range of miRNAs and lncRNAs in
regulating key endothelial cell-leukocyte inflammatory networks in atherosclerosis, such as NF-kB signaling.
Considerable gaps exist though in our understanding of how human ncRNAs contribute to accelerated
atherosclerosis and differences in T1D and T2D. We hypothesize the existence of evolutionarily conserved
driver ncRNAs and their targets in the arteries of subjects with T1D and T2D and seek to uncover their
expression, function, mechanism, and interactomes in the Cardiovascular Repository-T1D (CaRe-T1D) using
unique approaches across humans, pigs, and mice. To better understand these ncRNAs we propose to: 1)
identify and prioritize ncRNA expression from human subjects with T1D- or T2D-associated atherosclerotic
lesions; 2) explore the functional significance and mechanistic targets of ncRNAs on cellular inflammation,
senescence, and metabolic pathways; and 3) determine the therapeutic impact of altered ncRNA expression in
the progression and regression of experimental T1D- or T2D-associated atherosclerosis models. The
outstanding qualifications of our multi-disciplinary team in the ncRNA field, vascular biology, bioinformatics and
transcriptomics, molecular imaging, and translational aspects of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis uniquely
position us to establish an unprecedented molecular view of ncRNAs in the development of T1D-associated
atherosclerosis that can inform new paradigms of RNA-based therapeutics for this devasting disease."

Abstract: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces HIV-associated morbidity and mortality (1).
However, it is not a practical cure as eradication of HIV through ART alone is estimated to require over 60 years
of treatment (1, 2). Numerous studies support that HIV-specific T cell responses are critical for efficient targeting
and elimination of HIV infected cells that are the source of chronic infection (3-10). Unfortunately, viral escape
and a limited presence of functional virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells undermine the potency of these
responses in chronically infected individuals (11-17). As such, there is growing interest in the development of
novel immunotherapeutic approaches to target and eliminate HIV-infected cells to achieve viral
suppression in the absence of ART, a “functional cure”.
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies have demonstrated great promise against
blood cancers (18-20), and now also demonstrate the potential to mitigate HIV/SIV infection in rhesus macaques
(21, 22) and humanized mice (23-28). We recently showed that HIV-specific Dual CD4-based CAR T cells co-
expressing independent 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains restrict HIV replication and reduce viral burden
in humanized mice (23). However, current limitations of using autologous T cells to derive CAR T cell products
(TCPs), including time-consuming and costly manufacturing, insufficient or dysfunctional patient-derived T cells,
and the inter-patient heterogeneity of TCPs, are barriers to their widespread application to human diseases.
Development of allogeneic TCPs derived from healthy human donors, could, however, provide an ‘off-the-shelf’
treatment option to overcome these hurdles, as well as accelerate the use of CAR T cell therapies (29-38).
Unfortunately, post-infusion elimination by the recipient’s immune system remains a major hurdle (39-41).
 Here we propose to leverage our expertise in CAR T cell biology (21, 23, 25, 26, 42, 43), base editing
(44-49), and a humanized mouse model of HIV infection (50-58) to develop an allogeneic CAR T cell therapy
against HIV. Building on our preliminary data applying efficient multiplex base editing to CAR T cells, we
hypothesize that both base editing approaches and identification of an optimal allogenic donor will enable the
development of an allorejection-resistant CD4-based CAR TCP with enhanced efficacy to eliminate HIV-infected
cells and suppress HIV in the absence of ART. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine whether genetic modifications to allogeneic T cells can augment their in vivo
persistence.
Aim 2: Identify characteristics of allogeneic HIV-specific CD4CAR T cells that associate with enhanced
 persistence and antiviral efficacy.
Aim 3: Compare the in vivo HIV efficacy of allogeneic versus autologous HIV-specific CD4CAR T cells,
incorporating Aim 1 and 2’s signatures of improved allogeneic functionality.

11075565,"This project summary pertains to the Supplement. Different regions of the skin vary in their
characteristics such as thickness, pigmentation, innervation, and presence, size and density of hair follicles
and sweat glands, that are reflected in differential responses to injury and disease. While regional
characteristics of the skin are established during fetal development, positional information must be retained in
the skin throughout life to allow for maintenance of regional characteristics and their re-establishment in wound
healing. Positional information resides in the skin dermis, but its molecular basis is poorly understood.
 In the parent grant, we proposed to address these questions by identifying candidate factors and
areas of chromatin involved in establishing skin heterogeneity in embryogenesis through single cell RNA-seq
and single cell ATAC-seq experiments on different regions of developing mouse skin (Aim 1). To determine
which of these candidate factors and chromatin areas may also be responsible for maintaining regional skin
heterogeneity in adult life, we are performing the same analyses on the corresponding areas of adult skin. We
hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to maintenance of regional skin characteristics. To test
this, we will first identify patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications that characterize developing
dermis in specific skin regions by carrying out Bisulfite-seq to reveal sites of DNA methylation and CUT&RUN
for histone modifications that mark enhancers and active, repressed, or poised genes. We will then ask which
of these patterns are maintained in adult dermal cells from the same regions (Aim 2). To test the functions of
candidate regulators in directing and maintaining region-specific differentiation programs, we will use inducible
genetic tools to delete the corresponding genes in developing or adult mouse dermis in vivo. Initial analyses
have been focused on DKK2, SOSTDC1, IGFBP4, and TWIST1, that were identified in preliminary studies as
showing regional differential expression in developing mouse and human skin and influence molecular
pathways important in skin development and/or hair growth (Aim 3).
 The Diversity Supplement application is based on our subsequent studies that identified the IGFBP
family member IGFBP7 as being more highly expressed in hairless and less hairy compared with more hairy
developing skin. Unexpectedly, in adult dorsal skin IGFBP7 localizes to the arrector pili muscle (APM), an
essential niche for peripheral sympathetic nerves that innervate bulge stem cells in the adult hair follicle and
are required for their activation. Preliminary data from Igfbp7-null mice show that in the absence of IGFBP7 the
APM is disorganized and thicker than in control mice and shows abnormal branching. Based on these data, we
will test two hypotheses in the Supplement: (i) in embryonic skin, IGFBP7 contributes to suppression of hair
follicle development in hairless and less hairy skin regions; and (ii) IGFBP7 plays a separate role in dorsal
hairy skin to control development and/or maintenance of the APM."

We aim to combine the laser energy with a novel primer for bonding reversibly to high-strength ceramic crowns.
This proposal seeks to investigate the novel primer’s bonding and debonding capabilities to address the
destructive and traumatic removal of high-strength all-ceramic crowns using high-speed rotary instrumentation
which in addition compromises the underneath tissue, and fatigues the patient and clinician. This common clinical
problem, affecting many dentists and their patients, is highlighted by the National Dental Practice-Based
Research Network, with an estimated 2.5M all-ceramic restorations removed yearly. We introduce a novel,
drill-free, efficient, and non-yet-available debonding approach for high-strength ceramic restorations.
This method uses a unique binding promoter system comprising carbon nanosphere chains (CNSCs)
and 10-methacryloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), facilitating strong bonding to ceramics but
also enabling debonding after laser irradiation. This method offers innovative bond-debond applications
for primers in dentistry for high-strength adhesively bonded ceramics such as lithium disilicate glass-ceramic
and partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) ceramics. We will utilize an erbium-based laser, widely adopted in dental
practice, especially in North America, with a dominant 35% market share in 2021. The proposal’s specific aims
are 1) Characterize the bonding and debonding capabilities of lithium disilicate and PSZ ceramics treated
with the novel CNSC-MDP-based primer against benchmark products, and 2) Evaluate spiral and s-
shaped laser irradiation modes to promote efficient debonding. In addition, we will verify thermal changes
across different ceramic thicknesses, color changes, contact angle, viscosity, and the biocompatibility of the
novel primer. Our initial findings indicate a paradigm shift regarding PSZ ceramics’s low thermal
conductivity, as laser irradiation using 7.5 W at 20 PPS effectively transmits heat through PSZ ceramics,
softening the resin cement without affecting its integrity. Another novel aspect is the rigorous thermal mapping
of the laser irradiation and testing of standard geometry and clinically relevant specimens. We will test up to five
CNSC concentrations (0.06, 0.12, 0.18, 0.24, and 0.30 wt%). The findings of this proposal will elicit the dual
functionality of the novel primer for convenient, efficient, and predictable debonding of resin-bonded all-
ceramic crowns. Anticipated outcomes include improved removal ease, reduced patient trauma, and
restoration preservation, yielding significant time and cost savings. This revised application mantains the
original focus and incorporates reviewer's feedback, including bonding to tooth structure, verifying ceramics’
optical properties, and measuring CNSCs concentrations’ viscosity. This R03 will serve as a stepping stone for
future studies into primer activation using various external photonic triggers, such as varied laser energies and
potential UV irradiation. Future research will expand to other ceramic restorations, multi-unit, and 3D-printed
prostheses to streamline the novel primer across various applications and transition it from lab to clinic."

A Sorvall LYNX 6000 superspeed centrifuge is requested to enable critical steps during protein
isolation protocols that constitute an essential part of the research plan supported by grant
1R16GM145435-01A1. At a quoted cost of $76,200, the centrifuge together with a set of three
rotors will facilitate the purification of the Plasmodium enzyme PfATP6 for activity inhibition
assays. While this type of centrifuge allows for the processing of large sample volumes at low
speeds, it also facilitates spins of smaller volumes at high speeds that create a relative
centrifugal force of 100,000 x g. The latter type of spin is essential for parts of the PI’s research
agenda and currently not possible at the PI’s institution since the chemistry department’s
Beckman TL-100 highspeed centrifuge ceased to function last year and there is no other
highspeed centrifuge on campus. Due to its age, the Beckman TL-100 model it is beyond
repair because of the unavailability of spare parts. As a result, the PI is currently taking
samples to the pharmacology department at UC Davis (20 miles away) in order to use a
highspeed centrifuge there. However, these biweekly or monthly trips to UC Davis, each one
requiring several hours of the PI’s time, are only a temporary solution and they also prohibit
student training in the use of such an instrument. Thus, the acquisition of a superspeed
centrifuge would have tremendous benefits for the project."
11052110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) survivors are at high risk for developing vascular contributions
to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). However, there is limited data on the predictors and
mechanisms associated with VCID after sICH. Therefore, it is critically important to confirm novel biomarkers in
sICH survivors that may be associated with the development of and progression to VCID. Recent literature has
highlighted the discovery of new silent brain infarcts (SBIs) on MRI shortly after hospitalization in upwards of
50% of sICH patients. Though clinically undetectable, the mechanism through which SBIs in sICH lead to
worse functional outcomes in multiple cohort studies remains unclear. SBIs have been a well-described risk
factor for cognitive impairment and dementia in the general population. Given this epidemiologic data, cognitive
impairment may be driving the worse functional outcomes described in SBI positive sICH patients. This
proposal aims to determine whether SBIs are associated with worse cognitive outcomes and two key
mechanisms implicated in VCID development—white matter hyperintensities (WMH) progression and systemic
inflammation. In preliminary data, sICH patients with SBIs exhibit lower levels of global cognition, and lower
levels of episodic and working memory—two important cognitive domains affected in VCID. Furthermore, we
found that SBIs in sICH are linked to more rapid WMH progression and elevated chronic systemic inflammation
as measured by a three-finger toxin called soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). To
achieve our overall objective, we will test the hypothesis that SBIs in sICH are longitudinally associated over 1
year with: (Aim #1) a lower cognitive level and more rapid cognitive decline; (Aim #2) more rapid WMH
progression as measured by serial MRI; and (Aim #3) higher chronic systemic inflammation as measured by
serum suPAR. This research is highly significant since it will establish SBIs as an early, easily identifiable
neuroimaging biomarker for sICH patients at risk for VCID and mechanisms associated with VCID. This study
is innovative because it will: (1) generate comprehensive cognitive outcomes models in sICH; (2) employ a
novel WMH segmentation technique to measure volumetric WMH progression; (3) measure suPAR—a
treatable inflammatory protein—to assess systemic vascular inflammation. Ultimately, the knowledge gained
from this proposal will provide the necessary groundwork to support future treatment trials aimed at reducing
the cognitive morbidity associated with sICH through novel therapies that promote WMH regression and
reduce suPAR levels. Currently, minimal therapies exist to improve the outcomes for this disease."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified
as NOT-CA-24-015.
The proposed project aims to pioneer the development of a tumor digital twin, specifically focusing on enhancing
dosimetry and radiation biology within radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT). By leveraging advanced
computational models, this initiative addresses the significant gap in applying rigorously validated digital twins
for clinical and, notably, radiation oncology purposes. The emergence of RPT as a potent therapeutic option in
cancer care, employing targeted ligands labeled with radioactive elements, presents unique challenges and
opportunities. Unlike conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), RPT molecular nature results in a
heterogeneous dose distribution influenced by the differential expression of targeted receptors across tumors.
Our overarching goal is to construct a comprehensive and validated digital twin platform for neuroblastoma
tumors, encompassing the intricate dynamics of tumor evolution and the specificities of radiopharmaceutical
administration. In close alignment with an ongoing project focused on pediatric neuroblastoma within the U54
ROBIN initiative, this proposal aims to complement and extend existing research by incorporating a hybrid agent-
based model (ABM) capable of simulating tumor dynamics and radiation effects, including the beta emissions
from 131I-MIBG used for these patients. We introduce several novel aspects, including utilizing a hybrid multi-
scale ABM capable of handling clinically relevant tumor sizes, an explicitly modeled interacting vasculature, and
integrating Monte Carlo techniques for state-of-the-art dose calculation. The project is positioned to adapt these
innovations to neuroblastoma, leveraging patient-specific data from clinical trials to inform the digital twin
platform. The approach includes developing the digital twin with a keen focus on tumor heterogeneity and
radiopharmaceutical dynamics and adapting the model to neuroblastoma by incorporating trial data for
calibration and validation. Through these efforts, the project endeavors to create a predictive model that can
simulate individual patient responses to 131I-MIBG therapy, thus offering a translational tool poised to transform
pediatric oncology treatment strategies. This project promises to contribute substantially to the field by achieving
its objectives and providing a scientifically rigorous yet clinically applicable digital twin platform. This platform will
advance our understanding of RPT dosimetry and radiation biology and pave the way for personalized, optimized
cancer treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in pediatric oncology."
11057141,"SUMMARY
White matter injury (WMI) is the most common type of brain injury in premature infants and is associated with
adverse neurological outcomes, including motor and cognitive disability and seizures. There are no effective
treatments for preterm WMI. Translation of potential therapies from animal models to neonates has been slow
due to safety and regulatory concerns, while technical barriers to screening methods have limited the
identification of additional candidate treatments. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) and their precursors (oligodendrocyte
precursor cells, OPCs) comprise the major cell types implicated in preterm WMI, which involves an arrest of
differentiation of OPCs and a reduction in mature OLs and myelin formation. Thus, the OL lineage is an ideal
target for treatment of preterm WMI. Here, we demonstrate the development of a therapeutic pipeline for
preterm WMI in which pro-myelinating compounds are identified using a novel high-throughput screening
method, followed by in vitro and in vivo validation and testing. Using our fabricated micropillar arrays, we
propose to screen naturally occurring nutritional compounds found in breast milk to identify/confirm/validate
compounds and pathways that promote myelination. Based on extensive data of beneficial outcome
measures in breastfed infants, and preliminary data supporting pro-myelinating activity of a breast
milk carbohydrate, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), we propose that nutritional compounds in breast
milk represent an untapped and promising approach for the development of therapeutics for WMI in
premature infants. In this proposal we will: 1. Perform high-throughput screening of breast milk components
to identify pro-myelinating compounds, and 2. Test whether exogenous NANA promotes OPC differentiation
and myelination in vitro and in vivo and determine the necessity and sufficiency of the lysosomal transporter
sialin for this effect. Through the experiments proposed here, we are poised to make key insights into cellular
mechanisms regulating myelination that may lead to new treatments and molecular targets for preterm WMI, a
critical global health problem that affects over 500,000 infants per year worldwide."

11075574,"ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has affected tens of millions of people but remains incurable. The
major risk factor for AD is aging, which entails high brain entropy due to the progressive brain damages. Notably,
the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating a big
“reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this reserve may indicate a critical point of disease
conversion and progression. Reserve malfunction can be measured by the compensation outcome: functional
brain entropy (fBEN), which may reveal critical information for bridging the knowledge gap between AD
pathology and clinical symptoms: AD pathology begins long before AD symptoms and may not lead to dementia,
and may provide a brain marker for early disease detection. This project is proposed to characterize fBEN in
normal aging and the AD continuum and test an inverse U-shape fBEN model: fBEN increases with age and AD
pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. We will test the model using large existing
resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Our group started rsfMRI-based fBEN mapping in 2010 and released the first
open-source fBEN mapping tool. The tool has been widely used in many neuroscientific and translational
studies. To be scalable for large data, we will develop a further accelerated version in this project. In Aim 1, we
will calculate fBEN using data from 2000+ young and old healthy individuals from public databases and
examine the associations of fBEN to age, education, and cognitive function. We hypothesize that the brain has
a reserve-related network whose fBEN decreases with years of education and is negatively correlated with
brain function, suggesting low fBEN in this network as an indicator of brain reserve. Aim 2 will characterize fBEN
in AD and assess its associations to AD pathology and clinical symptoms. We hypothesize that there is a strong
pathology vs disease interaction on fBEN: fBEN increases with age and pathology in normal aging and lower
fBEN correlates with better cognition; those associations will be reversed in the AD continuum so that fBEN will
decrease with pathology level and lower fBEN will correlate to worse cognition. Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility
of baseline fBEN in regions elucidated in Aims 1 and 2 for early disease detection. Because fBEN may only
reflect some part of the functional abnormalities in AD, we will combine fBEN with other imaging biomarkers in
the model in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy. We will also build a model to use fBEN to predict AD
pathology in normal aging. The clinical impact of this project includes: 1) testing the hypothetical fBEN model
will help delineate the pathology vs clinical discrepancy in AD; 2) finding the disease related fBEN patterns may
provide a potential intervention target; 3) testing the prediction model will aid early disease detection; 4) AD
pathology prediction is of great clinical value for normal aging and AD management as current AD pathology
measurement is either painful or too expensive. The feasibility of this novel project and the many new
hypotheses have been initially demonstrated by our extensive preliminary data."

The overall goal of this project is to build next-generation sequencing (NGS) capacity
that will support One Health and antimicrobial stewardship. Currently, the NDSU VDL along
with multiple partners representing North Dakota zoos, human health lab, CDC, FDA, Vet-LIRN,
NVSL, and USDA are investigating a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella serovar Newport in
zoo mammals that clusters with a known human pathogenic strain, REPJJP01, making it a One

11055154,"Neovascularization in the retina or choroid of the eye is a key feature of major causes of blindness such as
neovascular age-related macular degeneration and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor biologics have greatly aided treatment, but resistance to therapy, side effects, frequent intravitreal
injections, and high cost remain significant limitations, creating a critical need for new therapy. Previous research
revealed an appealing new target for the development of such therapies: the heme synthesis enzyme
ferrochelatase (FECH), which, when inhibited or genetically modified, blocks neovascularization. The approved
anti-fungal drug griseofulvin is naturally metabolized in vivo to form a FECH inhibitor. Griseofulvin thus blocks
angiogenesis in vitro and in retinal and choroidal neovascularization animal models, offering promise for
“repurposing” this old drug for ocular neovascularization treatment. However, griseofulvin has not been optimized
for ocular use. For griseofulvin to be competitive with existing therapeutic modalities, it must be made available
in a long-acting formulation for intravitreal use. Preliminary data reveal that griseofulvin can be formulated into
polymeric implants and polymeric microparticles, which are amenable to sustained release over at least two
months and effective against laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (L-CNV) weeks after application. Given
this feasibility, the long-term goal is to provide a safe and affordable alternative to existing biologic agents by
developing long-acting griseofulvin systems. The hypothesis is that long-term griseofulvin delivery can prevent
ocular neovascularization. The hypothesis is based on prior research supporting FECH as an effective
antiangiogenic target and griseofulvin as an indirect inhibitor of FECH. Polymeric implants and particles are well-
received, long-term ocular drug delivery systems. With combined expertise in formulation, drug delivery, and
neovascular eye disease, and preliminary results supporting controlled griseofulvin release, the team is poised
to develop long-acting griseofulvin systems as new local therapies via three specific aims: 1. To optimize release
kinetics of griseofulvin-encapsulated polymeric microparticles and implants. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)
microparticles and hot melt extruded polymeric implants will be developed to achieve 2-12 month delivery and
characterized biophysically and in vitro. 2. To evaluate griseofulvin microparticles for antiangiogenic effects.
Optimized microparticle formulations will be tested for long-term drug release in vivo, toxicity, efficacy, and target
engagement in the L-CNV and Vldlr-/- subretinal neovascularization mouse models. 3. To evaluate griseofulvin-
releasing polymeric implants for antiangiogenic effects. The optimized implant formulation will be tested for long-
term drug release in vivo, toxicity, and efficacy in the DL-aminoadipic acid rabbit retinal neovascularization
model. The core innovation of this strategy is the repurposing of griseofulvin for ocular neovascularization
therapy by creation of sustained release formulations. If successful, these formulations would inhibit the
progression of neovascularization with minimum inconvenience to the patients and cost to the healthcare system."

tolerability studies in male and female minipigs that fully justified minipigs as the ideal nonrodent toxicology
species. The latter study was funded by an administrative supplement award (No. U44AG074107-02S1), with
the results described in this proposal.
This administrative supplement project will enable us to complete FDA-mandated GLP toxicity/TK study in
minipigs, the appropriate nonrodent species, and related bionalytical activities. Our pivotal cross-species
metabolism studies demonstrated that RT-002 was metabolized similarly in rat, minipig, and human hepatocytes,
with consistent in vivo results showing substantial systemic exposures of RT-002’s primary metabolites in rats
and minipigs following oral dosing. Recently completed non-GLP dose-range finder and 14-day repeated-oral
dosing toxicity/TK studies in male and female minipigs validated a maximum tolerated single dose (MTD) of at
least 500 mg/kg RT-002 and an MTD of 100 mg/kg/day over 14 days (once-daily [q.d.] dosing regimen as
intended in the clinical program). The steady-state RT-002 exposures were similar between sexes after 14 days
of daily dosing (AUClast males = 15,000 ng*h/mL; AUClast females = 12,400 ng*h/mL), with unremarkable cardiac
toxicity findings. These results support the planned pivotal GLP toxicity/TK studies in male and female minipigs
to establish the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) and MTD of RT-002 and evaluate dose-limiting
toxicities following q.d. oral dosing of RT-002 over 28 days. Outcomes from these final GLP studies will be
compiled into an investigational new drug (IND) briefing package and submitted to the U.S. FDA, enabling
Ridgeline to reach a crucial value-inflection point and begin clinical trials at the end of this project"
11081122,"PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting nearly 6 million Americans and
is expected to increase over the next several years. Our limited understanding of the mechanisms that trigger
the emergence of AD has contributed to the lack of interventions that stop, prevent, or fully treat this disease.
We propose to establish the marmoset as the first primate-specific model to reveal the earliest cellular and
molecular events of AD processes and allow charting AD progression from its inception. To do so, we will draw
from a self-sufficient and large colony of research marmosets with dedicated veterinary and husbandry teams,
state-of-the-art in vivo neuroimaging and molecular assays, and a multidisciplinary team of experts in aging
biology, AD genetics and genomics, animal model development and characterization, behavioral and cognitive
phenotyping, and marmoset gene-editing technologies. Our proposal’s overarching goals are to develop
marmoset models of early-onset AD (EOAD) and late-onset AD (LOAD) to enable the investigation of the
underlying cellular and molecular root causes of the pathogenesis and progression of AD and support future
translational studies. We believe that the simultaneous assessment of genetic, molecular, functional, behavioral,
and pathological phenotypes in marmosets will provide translatable knowledge of the origins and progression of
AD in human populations. Furthermore, we posit that the comprehensive study of gene-edited marmoset models
of AD from neurodevelopment through aging will identify emerging phenotypes that precede frank
neuropathology. Our proposal consists of 3 integrated Research Projects that aim to: (1) Conduct
characterization and validation of PSEN1 mutations in marmosets as a model for the study of EOAD, and
investigate early life molecular determinants of AD disease pathogenesis associated with genetic risk for EOAD;
(2) Identify and enhance LOAD-related signatures in outbred and genetically-engineered marmosets; and (3)
Conduct a comparative multimodal phenotypic characterization of marmoset models of AD. These projects will
be supported by 5 Research Cores focused on project administration, bioinformatics, genetic engineering,
multimodal disease characterization, and veterinary and colony management. These supporting cores will
integrate marmoset and human genomic signatures and provide data dissemination and resources to the greater
research community as part of our commitment to open science, generate novel gene-edited marmoset models
of AD, develop optimized protocols for studying disease onset and trajectory in line with clinical protocols,
evaluate therapeutic strategies, and provide specialized animal care and support, respectively, allowing
complete characterization of the marmoset models. At the conclusion of this project, we will have genetically
engineered three AD risk variants into marmoset models, established a disease characterization pipeline for
comprehensive phenotyping, and shared these resources with the greater research community."
11058343,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most prevalent conditions affecting human health including veterans in the 21st
century. Most of the focus of our efforts to understand the pathogenesis and therapy of the disease has
focused on two major components: insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. However, dysregulation in glucagon
secretion is a major component in diabetes. Hyperglucagonemia plays key roles in the pathogenesis of
hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and has a major impact in the glycemic volatility and susceptibility to
hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes. Our observations published during the current funding period suggest that
downstream of insulin/Akt, the nutrient sensitive pathway (mTOR/Raptor or mTORC1) plays a major role in
regulation of alpha cell mass and glucagon secretion. However, how mTORC1 acting on key downstream
targets (4E-BPs and S6K) regulates the function and mass of alpha-cells in vivo and the potential contribution
of these targets to the regulation of glucose metabolism remain unclear. The long-term goal of these studies is
to uncover how the nutrient sensitive insulin/Akt/mTORC1 axis regulates α-cell mass and glucagon secretion
in rodent models and humans. Our studies showed that loss of mTORC1 function in alpha-cells results in
major abnormalities in alpha-cell mass and glucagon secretion. We also demonstrate that gain of mTORC1
results in chronic hyperglucagonemia and alpha cell mass expansion suggesting that this signaling pathway is
critical for alpha cell mass and glucagon secretion. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
mTORC1 regulates alpha-cell mass mainly by a balance between S6K and 4E-BP signaling. The specific aims
will assess the individual contribution of downstream targets of mTORC1 by establishing the role of
mTORC1/4E-BP/eIF4E axis in regulation of alpha-cell mass, glucagon secretion and adaptation to
diabetogenic conditions using novel alpha cell specific models. In addition, we will also identify the importance
of mTORC1/S6K on the control of alpha-cell mass and glucagon secretion by generation of novel models with
inducible gain of S6K function in alpha cells. Finally, how mTORC1 activation alters human alpha-cell
responses will be determined using a model of human islet transplantation in the anterior chamber of the
mouse eye. This proposal will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern alpha-cell
mass expansion by mTORC1. This information can be used to uncover novel targets that can be used for
treatment of diabetes and design interventions to rescue the defects in glucagon secretion in response to
hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes."
11058560,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cervical cancer incidence is increasing dramatically (2.5% per year) in Puerto Rico (PR), with increased
occurrence of regional (1.7% per year) and distant (4.7% per year) stage cancer, which reflects a real increase
and indicates missed screening opportunities. Unfortunately, 80% of cervical cancer cases diagnosed in PR
occur among low-income women covered by Medicaid or Medicare, who also have a 70% greater likelihood of
being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening uptake continues to decline in PR, particularly
among low-income Medicaid enrollees, mainly seen by government clinics. Barriers to cervical cancer
screening in PR are mainly due to personal (lack of transportation, obesity-related embarrassment) and
environmental (repeated disaster events that hampered screening uptake and made recovery slow) factors.
The absence of evidence on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of patient navigators has
limited its adoption among government clinics in this US territory. Multicomponent interventions that can
address common screening barriers and improve screening participation in clinic-based settings or avert the
need for a clinical-based visit could help improve screening uptake and follow-up care. Our preliminary work
suggests the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling in PR. We now propose a hybrid type 1
effectiveness-implementation study using a four-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted
within government OBGYN clinics in PR. We will assess the effectiveness of patient reminders plus patient
navigation and HPV self-collection (individually and in combination) compared to patient reminders alone in
increasing cervical cancer screening, timely colposcopy, and cervical precancer treatment (Aim 1). The
secondary aim will evaluate key implementation outcomes, including patient and provider receptivity, reach,
level of implementation and fidelity, and sustainment intentions. We will then develop an open-cohort
microsimulation model to evaluate the population impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of alternative
strategies (Aim 2) to inform their potential applicability at delivery organization, community, and territory levels.
This study will provide much-needed knowledge that is necessary to successfully facilitate the adoption and
sustained integration of optimal strategies that will improve cervical cancer screening participation and reduce
magnifying disparities in Puerto Rico."

ABSTRACT
The type and pattern of immune cell infiltrate in breast cancer is of growing clinical importance as they associate
with response to therapy and are the specific target of immunotherapy. `Cold' cancers that lack infiltrating T cells
exhibit pronounced transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) activity and predict poor outcomes in breast cancer
patients. However, the factors that influence the genesis of the type of tumor immune microenvironment (TiME)
have yet to be defined. We found that radiation-preceded breast cancers in women treated with radiation therapy
for Hodgkin's lymphoma are significantly enriched for TiME devoid of lymphocytes and rich in myeloid cells,
TGFβ and cyclooxygenase 2. We used a Trp53 null mammary chimera model to determine the factors
underpinning of this unexpected difference. Tumors with an immunosuppressive TiME lacking lymphocytes
arose only in irradiated mice, even when the transplant was not irradiated, indicating host biology was key, as
well as in mice lacking functional adaptive immunity, pointing to a role for innate immunity. Strikingly, transient
aspirin treatment before cancer developed blocked the development of cold tumors. We hypothesize that
systemic inflammation provokes the development of tumors with immunosuppressive, cold TiME. Chronic low-
level inflammation from aging, obesity, stress and chronic syndromes following viral infection is common. Here
we will test the specific hypothesis that inflammation-induced TGFβ during carcinogenesis alters tissue-resident
myeloid cells to promote the genesis of cancers with an immunosuppressive TiME. AIM 1 will use state-of-the-
art analysis of cytokines and immune characteristics that correlate with the development of tumors with cold
TiME using a novel biobank of blood, plasma, bone marrow, spleen, and nonmalignant mammary glands and
their associated cancers as a function of inflammation or anti-inflammatory aspirin conditions at 4-, 8- and 18-
months post-treatment. The relevance of these findings will be tested by immunoprofiling women with breast
cancer. AIM 2 will use parabiosis to test whether factors circulating during systemic inflammation contribute and
use macrophage depletion and a mouse in which myeloid cells cannot signal through TGFβ to test whether
circulating TGFβ elicits monocyte activation to promote the development of cold TiME. AIM 3 will analyze the
resulting high-content data using deep learning and bioinformatics methods to identify tumor subtypes and to
infer key events. The main goal of our study is to test the innovative hypothesis that inflammation-induced TGFβ
promotes cold tumors by altering tissue-resident myeloid cells during carcinogenesis. Our proposal to conduct
systematic, high content analysis and modeling of the mechanisms by which breast cancers develop with an
immunosuppressive TiME is highly significant in view of the growing clinical importance of the TiME.

1. PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe traumatic injury and sepsis are acute pro-inflammatory insults that trigger a “genomic and cytokine storm”
by the host innate immune response that can result in multiple organ failure (MOF). Whereas many patients
previously succumbed to early refractory MOF, progressive advancements in resuscitation and organ support
have led to an increasing number of patients surviving to enter a state of chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as
a patient with an extended intensive care unit (ICU) stay and non-resolving organ dysfunction. Currently, as
many as 25% of trauma and 40% of septic patients in the ICU develop CCI. In addition to a prolonged hospital
course, these ICU “survivors” have recurrent infections, are unable to physically rehabilitate, and are frequently
discharged to high-resource care facilities with dismal long-term outcomes. Two clinical manifestations dominate
the course of the CCI phenotype: 1) recurrent nosocomial and post-discharge infections indicative of a state of
chronic immunosuppression, and 2) acute muscle wasting, weakness and physical debilitation indicative of
persistent inflammation. There is an expanding body of evidence that an underlying syndrome of persistent
inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism (PICS) is a key mechanistic driver of CCI. We hypothesize
that PICS is its own unique immunological endotype independent of the index event, and is the shared
mechanistic pathway leading from either trauma or sepsis to the clinical phenotype of CCI. This maladaptive
host response is sustained by the ongoing release of endogenous alarmins (DAMPs) associated with end-organ
injury, as well as microbial products from primary/secondary infections (PAMPs). This failure to return to
immunologic homeostasis also drives the persistent organ dysfunction seen in CCI. Muscle, being both clinically
relevant and understudied, serves as a novel area of study from the standpoint of inflammation-mediated end-
organ injury both as a driver of acute muscle wasting, as well as a potential source of ongoing alarmin production
and release. The goals for our laboratory’s research program over the next five years include the following: 1)
characterize the heterogeneity of the host response after severe trauma and sepsis by identifying distinct
endotypes based on immune trajectory over time, and whether these endotypes are modified by sex, age and
ethnicity/race; 2) determine if the PICS endotype is the common mechanistic pathway after trauma or sepsis to
the clinical development of CCI; and 3) determine whether muscle inflammation is both a component of chronic
end-organ injury, as well as a mediator of systemic inflammation through the systemic release of endogenous
alarmins. The proposed work is novel, innovative and vital. There are currently no therapeutic interventions
other than supportive therapies for the increasingly common condition of CCI after trauma or sepsis. We believe
that only through a complete understanding of the immunological endotype of CCI can effective therapeutic
interventions be designed. Focusing on interactions between host immunity and muscle inflammation is a novel,
under-explored area of research for the long-term management of severe trauma and sepsis."

Past-month cannabis use and tobacco use, independently, is 2 times higher in sexual minority young adults (SMYAs)
(defined here as lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual/bisexual+3) compared to their heterosexual peers.4 Young adulthood is
a vulnerable period for substance use initiation and progression5-7, coming out8, 9, and experiencing sexual orientation
discrimination.10 In fact, nearly 1 in 6 young adults (YAs) identifies as a sexual minority (SM). Bisexual and bisexual+
(bi/bi+) identity is the most common and fastest growing group of all SM identities,11 and individuals who identify as
bi/bi+ are at greatest risk for tobacco and cannabis use, independently, relative to both heterosexual and gay/lesbian
individuals.12,13 Cannabis and tobacco co-use (referred to as CAN-TOB co-use) has become increasingly popular in the
general population14-20, particularly among young adults (YAs), yet little is known about CAN-TOB co-use in SMYAs.21
This is concerning, as CAN-TOB co-use is correlated with greater cannabis and nicotine dependence,22, 23 poorer
tobacco and cannabis cessation outcomes,24, 25 as well as substance use and mental health problems,6, 26-31 relative to
single use of either. The popularity of non-cigarette tobacco products (e-cigarettes, cigars, etc.) among SMYAs is also
concerning, as these can be used as vehicles to consume cannabis.32-35 Minority Stress Theory36 indicates that coping
with sexual minority stressors (e.g., experiences of discrimination) is an important reason for substance use among SM
individuals.36, 37 Cannabis use has been associated with mood enhancement and tension-reduction, and may be
particularly appealing to SMYAs as a means to cope with minority stress experiences. Certain patterns of CAN-TOB
co-use, like blunt smoking, which result in an intense high38, 39, may appreciably temper or mitigate the negative mental
and emotional impacts of daily and “in the moment” minority stressors, and encourage future use of cannabis or other
substances, placing SM individuals at greater risk for negative consequences.40 Little data exist on day-to-day and “in
the moment” minority stressors and how they are correlated with different patterns of CAN-TOB co-use and single use
among SMYAs. This proposal addresses this gap by seeking to characterize different minority stressors among SMYAs
and examine their associations to daily patterns of CAN-TOB co-use and single use, in a sample of 150 SMYAs (ages
18-25) who are current tobacco users and consume cannabis > 2 a week. It is responsive to NOT-OD-22-166 (Research
on the Health of Bisexual and Bisexual+ People). Participants will track CAN-TOB single use and co-use as well as “in
the moment” minority stressors (e.g., daily experiences of discrimination) twice daily for 28 days via ecological
momentary assessment (EMA). We will characterize patterns of CAN-TOB single use and co-use and assess the
indirect association of daily minority stressors on the association of sexual orientation (bi/bi+ vs. monosexual) with these
patterns of use. Findings will inform the development of a future “just in time” intervention designed to target responses
to minority stress experiences in “real time” to reduce CAN-TOB single use and co-use among SMYAs. The longer-
term goal of this proposal is to identify the behavioral mechanisms contributing to substance use disparities in SM
individuals and to evaluate feasible intervention targets to reduce health disparities across sub-groups of SM people."

worldwide. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) accounts for 5-10% of all diabetes cases and is increasing at
a rate of 2-6% annually. Recent research has challenged the dogma that all β cells are
eventually destroyed in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Emerging data suggest that some cells in long-
duration disease may be protected from autoimmunity owing to the acquisition of a ‘de-
differentiated' phenotype that makes them less visible to the immune system. However, a
consensus definition and the precise phenotype of a de-differentiated cell has yet to be
established. Moreover, the heterogeneity of such a phenotype between single cells within and
between islets and persons with T1D is not clear.
Using single molecule Fluorescence In-situ Hybridization, our preliminary data has revealed
significant heterogeneity of the spatial transcriptome in cells. This project will utilize the newly
emerging tools such as computer vision and artificial intelligence, to deepen the exploration of
the FISH images of human pancreatic tissues. We will develop computational tools and
bioinformatics strategies to understand the spatial distribution of the transcriptome in T1D β cell
phenotypes.
(1) Develop computational tools to process, analyze, and quantify multiplexed transcriptomic
images and proteomic images of pancreatic tissue from human organ donors.
(2) Identify representative features of RNA expression in β cell phenotypes in long-duration T1D

important implications for T1D therapeutics, and it has the potential to inform the development
of disease modifying interventions aimed at improving the function of these cells."

Myotonic dystrophy is the second most common cause of muscular dystrophy and the most common cause
of adult onset muscular dystrophy. The primary cause of disease mortality is progressive skeletal muscle
weakness and wasting. The long term goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms that cause skeletal
muscle pathogenesis in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disease caused by
a CTG repeat expansion in the 3’ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The molecular basis for the disease
is a toxic gain of function of the RNA containing expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp RNA) that is transcribed
from the mutant allele. CUGexp RNA accumulates in nuclear RNA foci and causes loss of function of
Muscleblind like (MBNL) RNA binding proteins that are sequestered on CUGexp RNA within the nuclear foci.
CUGexp RNA also induces upregulation of CELF1 protein that has been shown to be toxic to skeletal
muscle. MBNL and CELF1 proteins regulate alternative splicing transitions of a large number of genes during
skeletal muscle postnatal development. Their altered functions in DM1 skeletal muscle causes misregulated
alternative splicing and inappropriate expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult skeletal muscle that leads to
disease features. While the basis for MBNL loss of function has been established, the mechanisms causing
CELF1 upregulation in skeletal muscle are unknown. We find that Mbnl1/Mbnl2 double knockout in adult
mouse skeletal muscle results in CELF1 protein upregulation, indicating a mechanistic link between MBNL
loss of function and increased CELF1 activity. We also established a transgenic mouse model for DM1 in
which skeletal muscle specific expression of a human DMPK mRNA containing expanded CUG repeats
reproduces DM1 features including CELF1 upregulation. The goals of this proposal are to determine the
molecular mechanisms of CELF1 upregulation in response to Mbnl1/Mbnl2 double knockout and expression
of the toxic CUGexp RNA and to determine the contributions of CELF1 upregulation to skeletal muscle
pathogenesis caused by MBNL loss of function and CUGexp RNA."

An effective epidermal permeability barrier (EPB) protects the skin from dehydration, inflammation, premature
aging, environmental exposure, and infection. Epidermal barrier dysfunction is an important feature of atopic
dermatitis, as well as numerous skin diseases including psoriasis, acne, and rosacea. A fundamental and
holistic understanding of mechanisms regulating homeostatic barrier function is essential to effectively prevent
and manage barrier abnormalities. The EPB function resides in the skin epidermis, which is home to diverse
microbial communities. The microbiome is recognized as a functional unit of the skin barrier. The skin
ecosystem is continuously challenged by the external exposome that includes ultraviolet radiation (UVR), air
pollutants and allergens. Critical for the barrier defense and homeostasis are xenobiotic sensors that recognize
external signals and help identify beneficial (e.g., commensal microbes) from harmful (e.g., pollutants,
pathogens) xenobiotics to regulate barrier defenses. Recently, I have demonstrated that commensal microbes
regulate epidermal differentiation and barrier permeability of the skin by activating xenobiotic sensor, the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). However, the mechanisms by which commensal microbes regulate EPB through
AHR under homeostasis, and in presence of environmental insults such as UVR are unexplored. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that tuning of epithelial responses by modulating AHR-commensal interactions
can alter barrier permeability. This project utilizes ‘multi-omics’ approaches by integrating transcriptomics,
metagenomics, and metabolomics to understand host-microbiota interactions in skin barrier repair. In Aim 1, I
will identify microbial signals from a synthetic commensal community that can activate AHR. These studies will
lead to identification of microbial ligands that can be used to target AHR in barrier diseases. In Aim 2, I will test
contributions of commensal microbiome in protecting against UV-induced barrier damage and use multiomics
approaches to characterize microbiome-host-UV interactome in the context of AHR signaling. These studies
will provide a framework to generate therapies that leverage understanding of environmental-host-microbiome
interactions. During the K99 phase, I will be trained in metabolomics to identify microbial metabolites. I will
receive advanced training in bioinformatics and systems biology approaches that focus on integrating multiple
omics datasets. The outstanding training environment at the University of Pennsylvania coupled with the
excellent advisory committee I have assembled, will greatly facilitate my research during the mentored phase
as well as launch my career with the skills necessary for understanding the role of the microbiome-host-
environment interactome in regulating skin barrier repair."

All eukaryotes harbor host-associated microbiomes. Determining what regulates host-microbiome function has
the potential to revolutionize our approaches towards maintenance of host health. Host genetics and the
environment are two key factors that contribute towards host-microbiome composition and function. We aim to
advance our understanding of the relative roles of these two factors in regulating assembly of microbial
communities, short-term changes in these communities through ecological succession, and long-term changes
through evolutionary processes. Further, microbiomes are complex biological networks. Understanding the
underlying structure of ecological interactions within these networks can improve predictions for when and how
microbiomes might confer beneficial versus deleterious functions associated with disease. Our lab aims to
advance fundamental understanding of host-microbiomes by leveraging the microbiomes of microbes.
Specifically we employ single-celled eukaryotic phytoplankton as a highly-tractable experimental system. To
further these goals we will focus on the following three themes over the next five years. (1) We will couple the
unparalleled diversity of phytoplankton with bacterial –omics approaches to test how microbiomes assemble in
response to host genetics. By assessing bacterial gene expression responses to host genetics, in tandem with
fluctuating environmental conditions, this work will lend insights in to the host genetic x environmental forces
that drive microbiome assembly of eukaryotic microbiomes. (2) We will evaluate mechanisms of microbiome
change for maintenance of host homeostasis in fluctuating environments, including ecological shifts in bacterial
taxonomic composition, shifts in bacterial gene expression, and bacterial strain evolution. It is important to
understand the relative roles of these mechanisms because each occurs over different timescales and their
effects can have varying degrees of permanence on their host. (3) We will leverage classical community
ecology theory in biological networks with recent advances in flow cytometry bacterial fingerprinting to
characterize traits of transient versus stable microbiome networks. We will quantify bacteria-bacteria
interaction strengths within naturally assembled and engineered microbiomes to understand how network
structure contributes to transitions between host health and disease states. Additionally, our research program
will elucidate the implications of declining microbial diversity on eukaryotic host health. We will study host-
microbiome co-evolutionary mismatches, such as those caused by humans consuming processed diets and
living in human-built environments that differ from those of our evolutionary history. Ultimately, our work will
leverage a highly tractable experimental system to advance our understanding of the microbiomes that

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devasting acute neurological disease that remains a major cause of
premature mortality. SAH is most caused by incidental rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (ICA). The mortality
rate of aneurysm rupture can reach as high as 40% within the first week of incidence. Even if the aneurysm is
treated in a timely manner, the chance of moderate to severe brain damage is 20-35%. Endovascular coil
embolization is the current gold-standard, minimally invasive therapy of ICAs; however, emerging clinical
challenges of coil embolization are unsatisfactory aneurysm recurrence rates: ~44% by 5-6 years after the initial
coil therapy (of which more than 50% requiring re-treatment), and suboptimal complete occlusion, especially for
treating wide-necked ICAs and/or aneurysms with a complex 3D geometry. Thus, there is a need for a durable
device to treat unruptured ICAs that targets patient-specific aneurysms and intra-aneurysmal circulation and
provides long-lasting complete occlusion. Our research objectives of this project are to: 1) design and fabricate
personalized embolic devices for treating saccular, bifurcated IACs using additive manufacturing and a combined
experimental/biomechanical approach, and 2) provide a holistic biomechanical and hemodynamic comparison
between our device and other selected endovascular embolic techniques. This proposal builds upon the
assembled preliminary data, and leverages Dr. Lee’s experience with tissue biomechanics and in-silico
modeling, in collaboration with polymer science and additive manufacturing researchers at the University of
Oklahoma, clinical and neurosurgical expertise of clinicians at Indiana University – Medicine, and micro-device
and catheter expert at Purdue. Specifically, we propose to design, develop, and evaluate patient-specific SMP
embolic devices using 3D printing-based polymer fabrication. Our embolic devices are designated to target
personalized aneurysm filling and maximize the rate of long-lasting complete occlusion. Next, through in-vitro
flow loop testbed and in-vivo small animal studies, the efficacy and aneurysm occlusion of our personalized
embolic devices will be systematically evaluated in comparison to the clinical gold standard as well as three other
contemporary embolic methods. The endpoint of this project will be a cutting-edge solution for ICA embolization,
that uses fundamental information on aneurysms based on holistic biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses
– allowing individual-optimized aneurysm filling to achieve immediate & long-term complete occlusion and reduce
aneurysm recurrence. Collectively, our developments will serve as a logical first step toward attaining our long-
term goal to advance the state of the art in translational medicine by facilitating personalized, preventive
management of unruptured ICAs and reduce aneurysm rupture-induced hemorrhagic strokes."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the predominant causes of disability and dependency among older
people, and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Late-onset AD is the most common form,
with more than 99% of AD cases occurring after age 65. The strongest genetic risk factor for developing
late-onset AD is carrying the APOE4 allele. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is primarily expressed by glial cells in
the brain and is the major protein component of lipoprotein particles secreted by astrocytes and microglia.
Lipoprotein particles provide a bidirectional mechanism of lipid transport between glia and neurons. Many
recent studies suggest that a disequilibrium in nervous system lipids is associated with increased risk of
developing AD. However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 affects cellular lipid homeostasis are
incompletely understood. We recently discovered that in glia, APOE can traffic to cytoplasmic lipid droplets
(LDs) rather than undergoing secretion on lipoprotein particles. We hypothesize that APOE plays previously
unrecognized roles in cellular lipid metabolism by acting directly on LDs in astrocytes and microglia.
Astrocytes play important roles in metabolizing peroxidated lipids, while microglia are the primary innate
immune effector cells of the central nervous system. In Aim 1, we will test the effect of modulating APOE in
astrocytes on cellular lipid composition, metabolism, and lipid peroxidation. In Aim 2, we will test the effect
of modulating APOE in microglia on cellular lipid composition, metabolism, and inflammation. In Aim 3, we
will fill a key knowledge gap by developing a community resource visualizing and quantifying LDs in various
brain regions and cell types in mice of different genotypes and ages. Together, these studies will lead to
new insights about the cellular and molecular mechanism by which expression of APOE4 leads to increased
risk of late-onset AD. This work could also lead to the identification of novel drug targets for preventing and
treating AD."

interact with adolescents’ perceptions of their peers’ substance use to predict their own substance use
engagement. However, it remains unclear why some adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence than
others, and how development confers increased risk for susceptibility. This work will examine the neural
correlates associated with individual differences in peer influence susceptibility. Specifically, we will assess
how increased functional connectivity within and between neural networks subserving greater sensitivity to
social rewards and punishments, motivation to attain rewards and avoid punishment, and representations of
social others is associated with greater peer influence susceptibility. We will also examine a network involved
in executive control as a protective factor against later substance use. Using a two-cohort, accelerated
longitudinal design including adolescents spanning grades 6-12, we will investigate how individual differences
in connectivity within and between candidate neural networks predict prospective substance use initiation in
the context of peers. Eight hundred adolescents (age 11-13 years) will complete baseline assessments of
substance use, and peer influence susceptibility using an innovative experimental paradigm. A subset (n =
250) of the initial sample will partake in longitudinal task-based functional imaging in year 1 and 3, as well as
multi-wave longitudinal assessment occurring at one-year longitudinal intervals in subsequent years 2-5 to
obtain extensive data on adolescents’ and peers’ substance use trajectories across a critical developmental
period associated with substance use. By delineating the neurobiological markers of social influence
susceptibility, project findings can characterize those individuals at greatest risk for substance use, which can
inform interventions by targeting the psychological processes that contribute to peer influence susceptibility."

Primary Care and Whole Health
PROJECT SUMMARY
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) reports “Implementing High
Quality Primary Care'' and “Achieving Whole Health: A New Approach for Veterans and the Nation'' call for
coordinated systems level approaches to care.1,2 In response to these calls for action and stresses on primary
care from the COVID pandemic and other market forces, primary care practices are increasingly owned by
health systems. In Virginia we have documented that between 2018 and 2022 there was an increase from 25%
to 43% of practices being owned by a health system with a concurrent decline in clinician ownership.3 These
changes could both help (e.g., provide a systems level approach, expanded interprofessional teams, new
resources) and/or undermine (e.g., reduce local decision-making authority, replace ambulatory focus with
hospital interests, undermine organizational culture) the ability to achieve NASEM’s vision. We propose an
explanatory sequential mixed-methods study using multimedia elicitation surveys and focus group interviews to
assess the impact of ownership on high-quality primary care and whole health care and to describe contextual
factors that may impact care. Building on our ongoing, longitudinal assessment of primary care in Virginia
conducted in the Ambulatory Care Outcomes Research Network (ACORN), we will randomly sample 30
primary care practices throughout the state, stratified by practices that in the past 5 years (a) moved from
clinician to hospital ownership, (b) stayed clinician owned, or (c) stayed hospital owned. The survey will consist
of a brief multimedia presentation, developed in collaboration with the NASEM report authors, of the key
elements of high-quality primary care and whole health, immediately followed by Likert scale questions to
assess team members’ attitudes, current practice, and confidence in the ability to improve on these elements.
The survey will be digitally administered with REDCap software to representatives of each clinical team
member type. To develop the multimedia elicitation survey, we will work with the NASEM report authors and
committee members to distill and operationalize core elements articulated in the reports, including questions
on equity, accessibility, integration, interprofessional teamwork, professional satisfaction and team wellbeing,
and community engagement. A practice structural questionnaire will also collect information on practice
organization and staffing levels, patient volume and population demographics, payer mix, EHR capabilities,
enhanced access options, and participation in innovative payment models. Follow-up group interviews with
practice teams will reflect on team survey responses and assess the organizational, practice, and individual
level factors influencing high-quality primary care and whole health care. Study findings will be used to further
AHRQ’s mission of revitalizing the Nation’s primary care system, promote the NASEM vision of Whole Health
in primary care, and develop future interventions to help primary care deliver high-quality and whole health
care in diverse ownership settings."

11075526,"Project Summary
Adolescent cannabis use has been linked to negative long-term outcomes in humans, including increased rates
of experimentation with “harder” drugs like opioids later in life. Yet these associations cannot be tested causally
in humans, so animal studies showing that adolescent THC exposure (adoTHC) indeed causes developmental
disruption of reward and cognition circuits are notable and potentially alarming. Here we employ a well-
characterized, translationally-oriented adoTHC exposure model in rats to examine how opioid-addiction relevant
behaviors are altered, and to uncover novel brain mechanisms by which these behavioral changes may manifest.
Notably, microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are increasingly being recognized for their key roles
in neurodevelopment, including in adolescence. In pursuit of a mechanistic understanding that can inform novel
interventions or strategies for opioid addiction, my project examines the effects of adoTHC exposure on
microglia, and how these changes may impact opioid drug seeking behavior.
I employ translationally relevant behavioral models of opioid addiction in rats to fully characterize the adoTHC-
induced pro-opioid phenotype, and employ both hypothesis-generating RNA sequencing approach, as well as
an experimental microglial “resetting” approach to test the causal relevance of microglia in the observed pro-
opioid behavioral phenomena seen in males and females.
During the F99 phase of this award, I will replicate and extend my findings, and obtain training and new data
employing RNA sequencing of FACS-isolated microglia in prefrontal cortex. The proposed training will
facilitate my transition to a competitive postdoctoral position focused on in vivo imaging and monitoring of
microglia, building upon my current expertise in addiction behavioral models. My sponsors will be instrumental
in helping me build skills in experimental design, guided analyses support, scientific communication, and
grantsmanship. They will also guide me in finding a postdoctoral training environment focused in
neuroimmunology aligning with my long-term research and career goals. Altogether, the F99/K00 award serves
as an invaluable asset in propelling me on a trajectory towards becoming a tenure-track addiction behavioral
neuroscientist."

Pain is a complex phenomenon that elicits somatosensory and motor reflexive responses together with marked
and long-lasting changes in emotional and autonomic states. While acute pain provides protection from tissue
damage, chronic or long-lasting pain, provides no protective function and is often incapacitating. Chronic pain
conditions are debilitating to patients, their families, and society by reducing quality of life and creating
enormous financial consequences that total more than 630 billion USD annually for the United States of
America alone. Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain that arises from a lesion or disease affecting the
somatosensory system and affects 7-8% of the general population. However, neuropathic pain is poorly
responsive to analgesic drugs, including opioids, and alternative therapeutics for treatment are desperately
needed. The underlying mechanisms of the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain are poorly
understood. A recent wave of high-profile publications implicates the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN) as a
sensory hub for pain and aversion. The PBN is, a small, bilateral, pontine brain structure that has long been
known to receive alarming, noxious, or threatening homeostatic information such as taste aversion,
nociception, or danger cues. Promising preliminary data within the Taylor (UPitt) and Betley (UPenn)
laboratories implicate glutamatergic PBN neurons expressing the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor (Npy1r-
expressing) in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. First, application of a cool (acetone droplet) or light rub
(cotton swab) stimulus to the hindpaw of a mouse following peripheral nerve injury produces significant Fos
activation within Npy1r-expressing PBN neurons. Second, pharmacological inhibition of PBNNpy1r-expressing
neurons via a selective agonist for the NPY Y1 Gi receptor reduces behavioral symptoms of neuropathic pain,
whereas chemogenetic activation of Npy1r-expressing neurons produces conditioned place aversion. Third,
application of a heat stimulus produces calcium transients in PBNNpy1r-expressing neurons assessed via in
vivo fiber photometry. These observations provide the premise for my central hypothesis that the Npy1r-
expressing subset of PBN neurons are necessary for neuropathic pain-like behaviors.
Specific Aim 1 will utilize in vivo fiber photometry and in situ hybridization to assess the activation of PBN
Npy1r-expressing neurons in both sham and neuropathic animals.
Specific Aim 2 will apply both in vivo pharmacology and chemogenetics to inhibit PBN Npy1r-expressing
neurons in sham and neuropathic animals to assess their necessity for the behavioral reflexive (mechanical
and cold) and affective (conditioned place preference) components of pain.
Specific Aim 3 will examine both the anatomy (anatomical tracing) and functional role (inhibitory
chemogenetics) of the supraspinal targets of PBNNpy1r-expressing efferent projections to uncover the specific
ciruit responsible for both the reflexive and affective components of neuropathic pain."
11079387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and
green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity
and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme
temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional
studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure
metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial
to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at
scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning
algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high
resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built
environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures
from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with
global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential
addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up
Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep
learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat
satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment
(e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact
high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment
on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these
metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity
from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built
environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential
address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their
residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative
residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable
us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to
elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better
specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy
and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health."

Dilation & curettage (D&C) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on women throughout the
world. Intrauterine adhesions (iUA), or Asherman, develop in about 40% of women who undergo D&C in the
postpartum (6 week period after birth), but is very rare after D&C in nonpregnant women (<1%) for reasons that
are not well understood. It is a debilitating condition characterized by intrauterine fibrosis and scarring. Patients
with iUA suffer from infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss and a broad range of dangerous pregnancy complications
(e.g. preterm birth). While endometrial mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (eMPCs) are crucial for endometrial
repair, the role of these cells and underlying molecular mechanisms in this postpartum susceptibility of the
endometrium to fibrosis and abnormal repair are unknown. This application is specifically focused on defining
the role that eMPCs and their stromal fibroblast progeny play in abnormal uterine repair. The central hypothesis
is that eMPCs of the recently postpartum uterus are more senescent and inherently different in their response to
uterine injury compared to eMPCs of the nonpregnant uterus, leading to fibrosis and scar formation. The
approach is to use our novel postpartum mouse uterine injury model which recapitulates the susceptibility of the
human postpartum uterus to injury. Using it, we will define the dynamic changes in eMPCs and their differential
response to uterine injury in the postpartum vs. nonpregnant, identify using lineage tracing the eMPC subsets
that become the profibrotic fibroblast cells, and conditionally ablate each of these eMPC subsets to define their
functional role in endometrial fibrosis (Aim 1). We will obtain fresh human endometrial tissue from women
undergoing postpartum D&C and compare it to nonpregnant tissue using innovative single cell technology and
functional in vitro studies to gain detailed insights into the cellular and molecular differences that predispose the
human endometrium to form iUA (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will obtain archived endometrial specimens from the time
of inciting D&C event from women who developed Asherman vs. non-Asherman. We will use the
innovative deterministic barcoding in tissue spatial multi-omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) platform and
integrate it with immunofluorescence to gain detailed molecular insights regarding eMPCs and their cell
interactions within the tissue, identifying novel therapeutic targets for iUA prevention. The proposed aims
are conceptually and technically innovative and together will have a broad impact on the field by filling a
substantial gap in our fundamental knowledge of endometrial biology and infertility pathogenesis using Omics
approach, which are major research priorities of the Fertility and Infertility Branch of the NICHD.
Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this proposal will not only be invaluable to our understanding of many
more subtle conditions of abnormal endometrial repair, but provide unique insights into the body’s
physiological anti-fibrotic wound healing mechanisms leading to a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of
fatal idiopathic fibrotic diseases in other organs."

RATIONALE: Neurological and psychiatric disorders collectively account for approximately 28% of the
global burden of disease, with the highest burden being found in low- and middle-income World Bank
countries (LMICs) where there are enormous barriers to healthcare. In this setting, there is a dearth of
clinicians and researchers trained in the neurosciences, limiting both access to care and research that
could impact outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: We propose the development of a brain health training program to increase expert brain
health research capacity and to develop valid and culturally relevant instrumentation to objectively
measure neurocognitive and neurobehavioral capacity. With this focus, we will create a cadre of
neuroscientists having the capacity to conduct research across all major disorders impacting the central
nervous system.
TRAINING PROGRAM: We have brought together leading experts in the neurosciences from Africa
(Uganda, Botswana, Congo, South Africa) and the US to create the Neurocognition and Neurobehavior
EXperts and Iest Instrumentation (NEXT) program in Rwanda. The proposed training program involves
academic instruction, practical laboratory experiences, and research criteria in three areas: brain health
(functional neuroanatomy, assessment, neurodiagnostics, neurorehabilitation), research (research design,
responsible conduct of research, neuroethics, statistics), and instrumentation (psychometrics). The NEXT
program tracks include a 3-year doctoral-level PhD track (8 students), a 2-year Master's degree track (6
students), and a single course track (up to 80 students). Two trainees will be selected for an intensive post
doctoral research fellowship at Emory University.
RELEVANCE: The overarching intended outcome of this program is to create the foundation of a
sustainable brain health program in Rwanda. This includes the introduction of a neuroscience-based
academic track at the University of Rwanda and the creation of a cadre of regional experts to conduct
independent research, mentor future clinician-scientists, and guide policy having brain health impacts."
11056675,"Veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often report visual problems despite normal or near-normal
performance on clinical tests of afferent vision. Strikingly, a similar pattern is observed in the auditory domain,
which suggests two potentially overlapping explanations for the (multi-)sensory deficits in mTBI: (a) damage to
the ascending sensory pathways produces subtle deficits that may not be detectable on standard clinical tests;
and (b) changes at more central levels of sensory processing or in cognitive, affective, or associative brain
networks lead to deficits in processing complex sensory environments. Therefore, an ideal measure of sensory
capacity in mTBI should account for changes at these different levels of processing. Returning to the domain of
vision, recent research suggests that color vision is highly sensitive to acquired disorders or trauma affecting the
early visual pathway. At the same time, color plays a significant role in higher visual functions such as object
segregation and visual attention. These properties make color vision an ideal candidate for assessment of visual
function in mTBI. However, current tests of color vision focus on detection of (primarily congenital) losses
originating at the retinal color receptors. The proposed study begins to develop a new test of color vision
designed to capture changes at low (e.g., retinal) and high (e.g., cortical) levels of visual processing. The test
relies on discrimination of chromatic textures whose individual elements are assigned an equiluminant shade
along a continuum from pure green to pure red. The distribution of colors follows a statistical pattern such that
discrimination among two textures with opposing patterns relies on the visual system’s ability to extract those
patterns. Different types of patterns are used to probe different aspects of color processing. Pattern extraction is
assumed to rely on a limited number of mechanisms sensitive to different shades of red and/or green and a
‘mixing module’ that allows the mechanisms to be combined in different ways to encode different patterns. A
mathematical model of texture discrimination performance is used to enumerate, for a group of observers: (a)
the number and structure of the low-level mechanisms; (b) each observer’s sensitivity to those mechanisms; and
(c) each observer’s unique mixing proportions. Performance across different chromatic texture patterns is taken
to reflect a given observer’s unique profile of red-green vision. This proposal aims to validate this paradigm in
groups of younger (25-34 yrs.) and older (55-64 yrs.) Veterans with normal color vision, given that low-level color
sensitivity is known to decrease by ~10% per decade of life with considerable individual differences in high-level
color processing within and between age groups. The first specific aim is to determine whether chromatic
texture discrimination captures aspects of color processing beyond those captured by well-established chromatic
sensitivity measurements. Red-green chromatic sensitivity thresholds from the Color Assessment and Diagnosis
(CAD) test will be entered with chromatic texture discrimination thresholds in a factor analytic model, where the
hypothesis is that chromatic texture discrimination thresholds will load on a different factor than CAD thresholds.
A novel ‘suprathreshold’ measure of chromatic sensitivity based on color-defined coherent motion will be
included to capture variation in chromatic sensitivity at higher levels of processing. The second specific aim
will apply the aforementioned mathematical model of chromatic texture discrimination to characterize individual
differences in bottom-up (mechanism sensitivity) and top-down (mechanism mixing) color processing.
Achievement of these aims will allow deployment of color vision tests – texture-based or otherwise – to
characterize the visual deficits in mTBI by providing a baseline for normal variation in color vision at multiple
ages and levels of processing. Notably, the red-green texture discrimination paradigm can be easily extended to
yellow-blue and grayscale vision. The long-term goal for this line of work is to combine texture-based and other
tests of complex visual function with related tests of complex auditory function to determine the extent to which
multisensory deficits at different levels of processing contribute to the functional deficits observed in mTBI."
11056963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Protein disaggregation and turnover are essential for protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and cell viability.
Malfunction occurs during cell stress and aging, accelerating deleterious protein aggregation and amyloid
formation. Improved mechanistic understanding is critical for determining how proteostasis pathways fail and for
identifying therapeutic targets in preventing neurodegenerative disease and other protein mis-folding diseases.
Heat shock protein (Hsp) 100 members of the conserved AAA+ family serve critical functions in all life as protein
unfoldases and disaggregases. They form hexameric, ATP-driven machines that catalyze the translocation of
polypeptide substrates through a central channel. The unfolded proteins are then refolded by Hsp molecular
chaperones or degraded by an associated protease, such as in the case of the proteasome.
 Challenges in achieving structures of functional states have led to conflicting mechanistic models across
the AAA+ superfamily. Focusing on conserved Hsp100 members, yeast Hsp104 and the bacterial Clp proteins,
we have overcome these challenges by using cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of biochemically
defined, functional complexes. We determined the first substrate-bound structures of a AAA+ disaggregase
(Hsp104) in distinct translocation states and discovered these machines operate by a rotary mechanism involving
precise substrate gripping and release states and a two amino acid translocation step. Since our last submission
of this application, we have determined multiple structures of the ClpAP AAA+ protease undergoing active
substrate unfolding and proteolysis Together our discoveries reveal a new paradigm for how AAA+s
mechanically unfold substrates. The next major question to address is: How is the translocation mechanism
(which is now considered highly conserved among AAA+s) coupled to specific cellular functions? Our long-term
goal is to determine how translocation and unfolding are precisely tuned for different proteostasis and cell stress
response functions. The objective for this application is to identify key allosteric control mechanisms that couple
ATP-driven translocation to substrate recognition, unfolding and degradation. Here we will: (SA1) Determine
mechanisms of protein unfolding and proteolysis by the ClpAP “bacterial proteasome” complex; (SA2) Determine
how Hsp104 interacts with and disaggregates native substrates and amyloids; and (SA3) Determine how the
Hsp70 chaperone collaborates with Hsp104 to promote substrate loading. At the completion of this work we will
identify conformational networks and protein:protein interactions that define how the core translocation cycle
connects allosterically to specify distinct cellular functions of these AAA+ machines."

There is a sex-based disparity associated with substance abuse disorders, which is evidenced by preclinical and
clinical studies. Females are generally more vulnerable to the initiation, escalation and withdrawal effects of
substance abuse behavior than males. Although these differences have largely been attributed to hormonal
differences, evidence for non-hormonal factors that regulate addiction has been demonstrated by a number of
studies. However, the mechanisms underlying sex chromosome influences on substance abuse behavior
represent a huge gap in our knowledge base on the epigenetics of substance use disorders. We propose a novel
hypothesis that escape from X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females contributes to sex associated
differences in addiction behavior. We will apply cutting edge technology and uniquely novel approaches and
tools we developed recently to comprehensively investigate the impact of XCI escape on sex associated
disparities in addiction. XCI is an epigenetic mechanism that occurs in mammalian females and serves to
equalize gene expression between the sexes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and during XCI, one X
chromosome is randomly chosen to be transcriptionally silenced. However, it is known that a number of X linked
genes escape XCI and display bi allelic gene expression. The objective of this proposal is to determine the
contribution of XCI escape on sex-associated differences in substance abuse disorder. First, we will use novel
cutting edge mouse models to characterize cellular mono-allelic (XCI) or bi-allelic (XCI escape) gene expression
of specific X-linked genes associated with addiction to opioids and psychostimulants: monoamine oxidase A
(Maoa) and GABAA receptor A3 (Gabra3). I pioneered an innovative approach using a gene specific dual bi-
cistronic reporter mouse as a tool to enable the visualization of allelic usage of these addiction associated genes
in vivo in a model of addiction. Next, we will determine the molecular landscape of XCI in brain tissue and specific
neuronal cells during chronic exposure to opioids and psychostimulants, using a highly innovative single cell
RNA sequencing technology. To accomplish these goals, I have assembled a talented, multidisciplinary team of
research collaborators in addiction, neuroscience, genetic mouse modelling, bioinformatics and biostatistics.
This innovative approach to the study and analysis of gene specific XCI escape as an epigenetic mechanism in
the context of substance abuse has the potential to open up a new area of research on the epigenetics of
addiction. Further, these genetically modified mice can be used to study XCI escape as an epigenetic mechanism
in other neurologic disorders. As an early stage investigator, these studies will also advance my long term
objective of becoming a future leader in the epigenetics of substance use disorders."

Skeletal muscle mass loss during cancer cachexia is one of the most important predictors of poor prognosis
and mortality among cancer patients. However, the role played by skeletal muscle mass in the survival of
cancer patients has been understood as a mere symptom of poor overall body health. Contrary to this notion,
recent studies have demonstrated that skeletal muscle has an independent and active role in improving
survival among cancer patients. Proof-of-principle investigations have shown that promoting skeletal muscle
mass, for instance by blocking myostatin signaling, can increase lifespan in tumor-bearing mice independently
of any effect of the drug on tumor volume. Therefore, understanding the mechanism regulating muscle size
can lead to better therapeutic targets to improve health outcomes among advanced cancer patients.
Ribosome biogenesis, the de novo synthesis of ribosomes, is a key process determining protein synthesis in
skeletal muscle. While there has been great attention recently to the roles of muscle ribosome biogenesis in
regulating muscle hypertrophy, the roles of muscle ribosome biogenesis to maintain muscle mass and during
muscle atrophy are largely unknown. We have generated a mouse strain in which we can lower ribosome
biogenesis specifically and conditionally in skeletal muscle. We crossed the Upstream Binding Factor (UBF, a
key transcriptional factor important for ribosomal DNA transcriptional) floxed mouse to the muscle specific
human α-skeletal actin (HSA) promoter linked to a CRE recombinase (HSA-MCM). Using this mouse model to
reduce UBF levels in adult muscles only (which we termed UBF mKO), we showed impairing muscle ribosome
biogenesis causes muscle atrophy particularly in type IIb and IIx myofibers, while Type I and IIa fibers are not
affected. Unexpectedly, long-term experiments using the UBF mKO mice demonstrated that impaired muscle
ribosome biogenesis have severe consequences to muscle and whole-body metabolism that phenocopied
cancer cachexia, including high respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and depletion of adipose tissue. With our
reversed engineered mouse model, we were able to recreate cancer cachexia from within muscle, challenging
the assumption that skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia is a mere effect of systemic disease. Rather,
our preliminary data strongly suggest that cachexia in the whole body can be initiated in skeletal muscle. This
proposal seeks to investigate the mechanism of muscle wasting via skeletal muscle and to identify the
mechanism leading to overall cachectic phenotype. If our hypothesis is correct, this will be the first evidence

11075542,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pressing issue in the United States, affecting over 6 million Americans and
ranking as the fifth-leading cause of death in 2020 for persons 65 and over. Approximately 90% of AD cases
are sporadic, reflecting an established contribution to AD risk of environmental and lifestyle risk factors (ERF).
ERF impact AD risk throughout the lifespan, but ERF during critical developmental periods may influence late-
life disease risk beyond what is currently appreciated. This may be demonstrated by abnormal brain maturation
(structural or functional) due to ERF exposure. While late onset AD is not often diagnosed until one’s mid 60s,
utilizing a lifespan approach acknowledges early life ERF that may influence risk to disease. Utilizing an AD
lens can help investigate these early life influences, with the goal of identifying early interventions for reducing
neurodegenerative risk. The F99 phase of my proposal will investigate prenatal and childhood ERF and their
association with memory. The central hypothesis is that AD associated ERF (AD-ERF) during childhood are
linked to the neurodevelopment of AD associated brain systems (hippocampus, hippocampal dependent
memory), and these links affect AD vulnerability in late life. There is a notable gap in understanding how early-
life AD-ERF bias cognitive development towards neurodegenerative risk. To investigate this, I will measure
how a person’s environmental exposures (stress, socioeconomic status, neighborhood deprivation index) in
the prenatal, personal, and parental environments (as identified through a factor analysis using the Adolescent
Brain and Cognitive Development study: Aim1A) controlling for familial AD risk (via grandparent/great
grandparent blood biomarker assay: collected from parent study) influence hippocampal dependent RM in
children. The F99 phase will include training in reproducible neuroimaging, advanced statistics, and scientific
communication. Completion of the F99 phase lays a strong intellectual, technical, and professional foundation
for the postdoctoral (K00) phase of this award. During the K00 phase, training in epigenetics and AD-
associated biological aging will develop knowledge, expertise, and skills essential to becoming an independent
investigator. It is my long-term goal to establish a multi-disciplinary research laboratory focused on studying
modifiable AD risk factors in order to develop and implement treatments or preventative programs that might
reduce AD risk in populations with high vulnerability due to their environment. This research will shed light on
the relationship between environments and development, offering insights into the predictive power of the
environment in shaping AD risk. Ultimately, this work could lead to early interventions for AD, addressing the
looming public health crisis posed by an aging, AD-vulnerable US population."
11075552,"Project Summary/Abstract
The serotonergic (5HTergic) system is implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
phenomena, including regulation of mood and stress reactivity. While 5HT actions have been assumed to be
mediated exclusively through 5HT receptors, studies have established 5HT forms covalent bonds with histone
H3—resulting in H3 glutamine 5 serotonin (H3Q5ser)–a process known as H3 serotonylation. H3 serotonylation
plays key regulatory roles in establishing normal embryonic and adult patterns of brain transcriptional plasticity.
However, functional roles for H3 serotonylation during postnatal brain development, have been unexplored, and
the impact of environmental stimuli on this modification during early life remains unknown. Our laboratory
implemented FANS coupled CUT&RUN (C&R)-seq to profile the cell type-specific epigenomic landscape of H3
serotonylation in mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), across critical periods of postnatal brain development.
We identify cell-type-, sex-, developmental-, and early life stress- (ELS) induced alterations in H3 serotonylation
genomic enrichment, with males showing more pronounced developmental and ELS-induced changes in both
neuron and glia populations. In males, further analysis reveals, H3 serotonylation binding increases at
oligodendrocyte genes in response to ELS. While these findings are insightful, they alone cannot elucidate the
cell-type-specific functional roles of H3 serotonylation on gene expression or its potential influence on behavioral
phenotypes. In the F99 phase, I will test the hypothesis that H3 serotonylation critically regulates
neurodevelopmental gene expression, and perturbation by ELS results in altered gene expression and increased
vulnerability to stress-related behavioral phenotypes as a function of this novel PTM. I will utilize multi-omic
bioinformatic tools to integrate epigenomic and transcriptomic (ie. RNA and C&R-Seq) data to uncover the causal
link between H3 serotonylation and gene expression during critical postnatal brain development and in response
to ELS. Using a novel cell-type specific viral construct, I will attenuate ELS-induced H3 serotonylation changes,
to elucidate the functional cell-type specific roles of H3 serotonylation in brain development and its connection
to stress-related behaviors in adulthood. During this phase, I will receive technical training on large-scale data
analysis, integration of cell-type specific “omic” data, and molecular cloning techniques that can be used to create
gene editing tools to manipulate epigenetic modifications such as H3 serotonylation in vivo. In the K00 phase, I
will focus on identifying laboratories for my postdoctoral work, prioritizing expertise in circuit-specific approaches
(circuit characterization/manipulation), functional readouts of neuronal physiology (fiber photometry), and use of
computer vision and machine learning to unbiasedly quantify animal behaviors. Together, this training across
F99 and K00 phases will support my successful transition to postdoctoral researcher and ultimately a career as
an independent research scientist focusing on how circuit level changes following stress exposure intersect with
epigenomic and transcriptomic changes in development and how these changes play in psychiatric disease."

11080693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Converging evidence indicates that neuronal and network hyperexcitability is an important early event in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The cellular and molecular basis of this hyperexcitability is a critical area of
investigation and the presence of similar hyperexcitability in animal models enables studies to dissect
underlying mechanisms. A key insight is that hyperexcitability in both AD patients and mouse models has a
strong diurnal rhythm. Emerging data also indicate that neural excitability in the forebrain is normally under
control of the circadian clock, which regulates seizure thresholds and susceptibility to epileptiform activity.
Circadian variation in cellular function is driven by transcriptional molecular clocks expressed in most cells, and
molecular clock ablation increases AD pathology. We have compelling preliminary evidence for rhythmic
variation in neuronal excitability that is at least partly due to circadian regulation of the membrane properties of
inhibitory interneurons, especially fast-spiking cells expressing parvalbumin (PV). Given that PV+ interneurons
in the cortex and dentate gyrus are strongly implicated in AD, and that circadian rhythms are disrupted in AD
patients and AD mouse models, we propose rigorous experiments to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of
the molecular clock and resulting changes in PV+ interneuron gene expression and activity contribute to AD-
related neuronal hyperexcitability. Specifically, we will evaluate the differences in circadian clock and clock-
controlled gene expression in PV+ interneurons vs. excitatory neurons in the mouse models of AD, using a
combination of RNA sequencing, state-of-the-art bioinformatics, and recently developed tools to evaluate
molecular clock rhythmicity and transcription in a cell-specific manner (Aim 1). We will record from inhibitory
and excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus and cortex to determine if clock-driven changes in PV+ inhibitory
neuron activity are disrupted in AD models and contribute to overall hyperexcitability (Aim 2). Finally, we will
utilize an innovative chemogenetic chronotherapeutic approach to manipulate PV+ interneuron physiology to
determine whether reinstating the normal circadian patterns of PV+ interneuron activity in AD mice protects
against hyperexcitability, cognitive impairment, and pathology (Aim 3). The proposed studies led by a strong
interdisciplinary team use powerful approaches to determine how disruption of circadian rhythms facilitates
neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to early stages of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may
catalyze development of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions."

This proposal requests partial support for an internationally-attended meeting on Ion Channels, as part of the
Gordon Research Conference (GRC) series, to be held at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley,
Massachusetts, July 7 – 12, 2024 which immediately precedes with a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS)
specifically aimed towards graduate students, post-docs, and early career scientists, to be held July 6-7, 2024,
at the same location. The broad and long-term goal of the conference is to increase our understanding of the
structure, function and physiological roles of ion channels, their targeting by next-generation therapeutics, and
the molecular basis of channel dysfunction in disease. The 2024 iteration of the meeting will convene leading
researchers to share unpublished, cutting-edge research on these proteins responsible for electrical signaling
and ion transport. Recent advances in structural biology, high-throughput experimental methods, and machine-
learning approaches can potentially revolutionize biological research. This edition of the meeting will highlight
how big data and other emerging approaches are providing new insights into the role of ion channels in human
physiology and diseases. Our diverse panel of speakers and discussion leaders will present the latest advances
in understanding the biology and mechanisms of ion channel structure, gating, regulation and drug action. The
specific aims of this meeting will be to assemble roughly 45 speakers and discussion leaders representing critical
areas of ion channel research, with a maximum total of 200 participants, for a five-day meeting in a secluded
setting. The program will have nine platform sessions that address current issues in ion channel mechanisms in
human health and disease, incorporating late-breaking talks to be determined shortly before the conference, to
promote discussion on the newest cutting-edge research. Ample time will be allotted during the platform sessions
for discussion and exchange of ideas. In addition, four poster sessions will allow all participants to present their
latest research and further scientific discussions. The significance of this proposal is that the Ion Channels GRC
is widely regarded as a key, established conference to fertilize ideas and research in the community of ion
channel biologists. Indeed, the small size and intensive discussions facilitated by the Ion Channels GRC make
it uniquely important for the catalysis of new ideas and directions among the participants. The goals of the
meeting are to advance our understanding of ion channels as key players in the function of nerves, muscles,
sensory organs, and other systems and as therapeutic targets for the cure and treatment of human disease."
11057137,"Project Summary/Abstract
This study is guided by a long-term goal of optimizing alcohol-related intimate partner violence (IPV;
psychological, physical, sexual, and identity abuse [e.g., threatening to out a partner]) interventions for bisexual
and other multigender-attracted (bi+) young adults and their partners. As a critical first step toward this goal, this
R21 will identify modifiable intervention targets for alcohol-related IPV by developing new scientific knowledge
of the unique day-to-day processes that potentiate and ameliorate IPV after alcohol use among bi+ young adults
and their partners. This study will also explore subpopulations of bi+ young adult couples who should be
prioritized in future alcohol-related IPV research (e.g., same- vs. different-gender dyads).
Alcohol use proximally increases the likelihood of IPV perpetration, particularly among young adults ages 18-25.
Relative to those with other sexual identities, more bi+ young adults endorse heavy alcohol use and IPV, but
research has not identified daily experiences that may potentiate or mitigate alcohol-related IPV within this
priority population. This critical scientific gap may be attributed to (1) limited inclusion of bi+ populations in
alcohol-related IPV research, with no daily diary studies focusing on bi+ young adults, (2) a lack of data on bi+-
specific minority stressors in existing alcohol-related IPV research, and (3) limited couple-level data from bi+
young adults despite IPV being a dyadic process impacted by both partners’ alcohol use and minority stress.
This study will address these gaps by examining potential intervention targets (i.e., bi+ minority stress, partner
support) implicated by sexual minority alcohol-related IPV theory that exacerbate or mitigate IPV after drinking
in the naturalistic settings of bi+ young adults and their partners. A rigorous, 60-day, daily diary approach will be
used to collect daily reports of alcohol use, minority stress (e.g., bi+-specific stressors), partner support, and IPV
perpetration/victimization from 50 bi+ young adults and their partners (N=100 individuals; 25 same-gender
couples, 25 different-gender couples). Study aims are: (1) Determine if one’s own and one’s partner’s alcohol
use increases IPV perpetration on days when bi+ individuals and their partners report high, but not low, levels
of minority stress. (2) Determine if one’s own and one’s partner’s alcohol use increases IPV perpetration on days
when individuals perceive their partners as providing low, rather than high, levels of partner support. (3) Across
Aims 1 and 2, explore descriptive differences between (a) same- and different-gender dyads, (b) couples in
which only one partner has, rather than both partners having, a minoritized sexual identity, and (c) IPV types to
identify priority populations for future research. Data generated from this study will provide the most
comprehensive, theoretically-informed assessment of alcohol-related IPV among bi+ young adults and their
partners to date. In doing so, these results will provide the foundation required for future research to develop
alcohol-related IPV interventions effectively tailored to meet the needs of bi+ young adults."

Obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
depression, and cancer. Elucidating the neural mechanisms that regulate feeding behavior and body weight
control is critically needed towards the development of effective strategies to combat obesity and its co-
morbidities. We discovered that anoctamin 4 (Ano4, an ion channel) is abundantly expressed in the area
postrema (AP) in the hindbrain. Activation of these APAno4 neurons increase food intake and blood glucose in
mice. Importantly, a large-scale human genetic study established the association of the ANO4 gene mutation
with human obesity, but the causality of this association has not been tested. The first objective is to determine
physiological relevance of APAno4 neurons in energy/glucose balance. We will use both gain- and loss-of-function
models to establish the function of the APAno4 neurons on feeding and valence behavior, as well as long-term
regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis. The second objective is to use a Cas9-mediated DNA editing
to delete Ano4 only in AP neurons, and to determine physiological functions of the Ano4 channel on the
excitability of AP neurons and on the whole-body energy/glucose balance. The third objective is to use a
humanized Ano4 knock-in mouse model (mimicking the obesity-associated human ANO4 mutation) to determine
whether this mutation causes obesity in mice and alters Ano4 channel functions. Completion of the proposed
research will identify a novel target that regulates body weight balance in mice and humans, and provide the
necessary framework to develop therapeutic strategies towards treating obesity."

11055067,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Stark racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease reflect greater exposure to deleterious contextual stressors,
including cultural stressors (e.g., racial discrimination) and low socioeconomic status. Over the life course,
these stressors “get under the skin” via maladaptive psychological and behavioral coping and persistent
activation of stress response systems, leading to uneven chronic disease burden by race/ethnicity. By
adolescence, cultural and socioeconomic stressors can produce the physiological, behavioral, and
psychological precursors to chronic conditions among minoritized youth. Thus, effective coping skills in
adolescence are critical to ameliorating the early signals of chronic disease and pre-empting chronic disease
progression among minoritized youth. Shift-and-persist (S&P) coping, where one reappraises life stressors
(i.e., shifting), while finding meaning and maintaining optimism (i.e., persisting), shows promise as a successful
coping strategy to mitigate the early signs of chronic disease among racial/ethnic minority adolescents, yet
more investigation is needed prior to designing S&P coping interventions for minority youth. Using data Project
PISCES, a 6-wave study of racially/ethnically diverse adolescents, in combination from data from the U.S.
Census Bureau, this project addresses three aims: 1) to understand how socioecological assets predict unique
trajectories of S&P coping across adolescence 2) elucidate how the health effects of configurations of
contextual stress may vary by distinct trajectories of shift-and-persist coping across adolescence and, 3)
design and conduct a feasibility study of a digital S&P coping single-session intervention targeting racial/ethnic
minority youth. The findings from this program of research will uncover key factors that contribute to the long-
term development of S&P coping, provide further clarity on the responsiveness of S&P coping over time to the
broader landscape of stressors that shape minoritized youth’s health outcomes, and contribute to evidence
regarding intervention modalities that can enhance S&P coping among racial/ethnic minority adolescents. The
proposed project combines an interdisciplinary program of research, mentorship, and
education/apprenticeships to provide robust training in the following areas: 1) mixture modeling analyses, 2)
content expertise development in biopsychosocial models of health and use of biomarkers in research, 3)
participatory intervention design and evaluation, and 4) professional development. Training in these domains
will propel the candidate towards a long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator with the
ability to develop evidence-based health interventions which address contextual drivers of health among
racial/ethnic minority adolescents. Such interventions are crucial to facilitating healthy transitions to adulthood
for minoritized youth and disrupting pathways to chronic disease, consistent with the priorities of NIMHD."

11055549,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioids remain the most efficacious, but insufficient, analgesic regimen for treating patients with oral cancer
pain. Oral cancer pain is generated at the primary cancer site and is associated with high levels of proteases
released in the cancer microenvironment. These proteases cleave distinct regions of the protease-activated
receptor 2 (PAR2) to activate PAR2 and mediate cleavage site-specific intracellular trafficking and signaling of
the receptor. Mice lacking PAR2 do not develop oral cancer pain, highlighting a central role for neuronal PAR2 in
oral cancer pain. The impact of oral cancer on PAR2 signaling and trafficking in trigeminal (TG) neurons is not
known. The long-term goal is to improve management of oral cancer patients by identifying components of the
PAR2 signaling cascade that are viable targets for development of location-selective drug delivery systems to
alleviate oral cancer pain. The overall objectives for this application are to augment my expertise in signaling
and nanoparticle drug development by gaining training in oral cancer pain and research with complex biological
systems, as well as undertaking career development activities to foster transition to an independent investigator.
The central hypothesis for the proposed research is that oral cancers release proteases that activate PAR2 and
induce sustained pain via PAR2 signaling from multiple cellular compartments in neurons. The rationale for this
project is that identification of cancer-induced PAR2 signaling and trafficking affords the opportunity to develop
drug delivery systems that specifically target these signaling pathways to treat cancer pain. The central
hypothesis will be tested by three Aims: K99, Determine oral cancer-induced changes in the 1) trafficking and 2)
signaling of PAR2 in TG neurons, and 3) R00, Develop nanoparticles to target PAR2 located at the plasma
membrane, endosomes and Golgi to alleviate oral cancer pain. In Aim 1, cancer induced changes in PAR2
trafficking will be investigated by confocal microscopy using TG neuron cultures from PAR2-muGFP mice bearing
oral cancers and controls. Aim 2 will evaluate the signaling of neuronal PAR2 by measuring cAMP and Ca2+ in
TG neuron cultures from cancer bearing and naïve mice expressing PAR2-muGFP in sensory (Nav1.8) neurons.
For aims 1 and 2, TG cultures will be challenged with (a) four oral cancer proteases, (b) a mixture of these
proteases, and (c) conditioned media (CM) from human oral cancers that contain pain mediators (proteases)
released by the cancers. The focus of the R00 phase will be on the development and in vitro and in vivo
evaluation of location-selective nanoparticles targeting PAR2 at the plasma membrane, endosomes and Golgi.
The proposed studies are innovative because they are motivated by previously unappreciated oral cancer-
induced PAR2 trafficking and signaling, and the drug targeting and delivery approach. The work is significant
because these studies will lay the foundation for repurposing drugs to target PAR2 at specific intracellular sites."

Oral HPV is the cause of increasing incidence of HPV-related oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) in the
United States and globally, and is expected to continue into the next century despite an effective
vaccine. The risk of HPV-OPC and HPV-related anogenital malignancies is significantly increased
among people living with HIV (PLWH). Oral and plasma HPV and E6 antibodies are associated with
increased future risk of HPV-OPC and present an opportunity for screening for HPV-OPC. We have
developed the longest running and largest cohort of healthy people living with and without HIV, with
biomarkers of HPV-OPC. This study will combine our existing unique enriched cohort of individuals
with HPV16 biomarkers with new participants identified in a screening scenario to develop a larger
cohort of individuals at-risk for HPV16-OPC (called the MOUTH2 study). We will screen for oral and
blood biomarkers with the aim to 1) study progression to HPV-OPC and how it differs in those with
and without HIV; 2) characterize impact of HIV on oral HPV16 persistence, and 3) evaluate
performance characteristics of stand-alone vs sequential biomarker screening. This prospective
observational cohort will provide the ability to examine questions necessary to understand the long-
term natural history of oral HPV in people living with and without HPV and to inform future study
design to elucidate the benefits and harms of screening."
11073531,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need to develop novel and innovative technologies to advance health and therapeutic
interventions and to develop tools for monitoring of disease progression in the musculoskeletal system.
Molecular details of disease and injury of the musculoskeletal system are particularly needed for novel proteomic
assays to monitor disease progression in osteoarthritis or meniscal injury. Our innovative approach includes
development of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) technologies for joints to spatially visualize proteins of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) and glycans, and to apply deep proteomic profiling of bones. These
technologically novel approaches will also enable us to develop urgently needed molecular assays to assess the
efficacy of interventions. Molecular changes related to age, injury or osteoarthritis (OA) in musculoskeletal
tissues, particularly bone and cartilage, are typically spatially distinct. This is even more evident when
considering temporal and dynamic changes during emerging functional decline. Our national team provides a
unique combination of expertise to develop new, innovative and paradigm-changing tools to investigate bone
diseases, such as OA, age-related changes in bone, and changes induced by injury to meniscus. Dr. Schilling
(Buck Institute) is an expert in proteomics, global bone analysis, senescence and aging, Dr. Alliston (UC San
Francisco) is an expert in orthopedics, bone mechano-biology, and osteoarthritis disease biology, and Dr. Angel
(Medical University of South Carolina, MUSC) is an expert in MSI, spatial ECM proteomics, and glycan biology.
We will employ and optimize state-of-the-art mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) technologies to spatially
resolve molecular changes in tissues (using a molecular readout mass/charge: m/z) in human and mouse
tissue slices monitoring hundreds of analytes simultaneously. These innovative technologies indicate premise to
develop into groundbreaking tools for the orthopedic and musculoskeletal community to investigate bone and
cartilage decline, and to monitor interventive treatments. With this paradigm change, we will be able to image
hundreds or even thousands of molecules simultaneously at 15 to 40 µm spatial resolution. Protein signatures
from the extracellular matrix in human OA knee tissues revealed very advanced disease progression in cartilage
and bone at the inner (medial) side of the knee (with healthier tissue at the outer/lateral side) discovering distinct
novel OA protein targets. These results and novel spatial assays, in combination with deep proteomic profiling
of the bone proteome (>2,000 protein groups), will provide insights into disease mechanisms and allow for
unbiased proteomic monitoring during functional decline of joints and bones. Robust statistical processing is
implemented. As individual lifespans increase across the world, age-related complications are increasing and
develop into a major public health challenge. The unique MS Imaging and Proteome Profiling capabilities of
our team provide major opportunities for the discovery of Novel Disease Targets for therapeutic interventions."

The scope of the SVEUs includes housing and maintenance of NHPs, the conduct of studies supporting AIDS prevention research, with an emphasis on AIDS vaccines, support of a NHP breeding colony, and general administration and management of these activities."
11078943,"Itch, or pruritus, is a commonly reported symptom with over 7 million clinician visits annually in the
United States. Indeed, the Global Burden of Disease Study by the World Health Organization categorized itch
in the top 50 most prevalent diseases worldwide. Itch is difficult to manage, as there are limited therapeutics.
There are also racial differences in itch in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and prurigo nodularis
(PN), which disproportionately affect African Americans (AA). AD is more likely to be papular, affect extensor
areas, and less likely to be associated with filaggrin loss-of-function mutations in blacks as compared to
Caucasians. This study will investigate novel itch receptors and cytokine profiles in human AD and PN patients
with respect to race to provide biomarkers and potential targets for future therapeutics.
 Our first aim focuses on a recently discovered group of itch receptors, known as Mas-related G protein-
coupled receptors (Mrgprs). In humans, there are 4 Mrgpr genes (MrgprX1-4). A role for three of the MrgprX
genes in humans has been elucidated: MrgprX1 mediates chloroquine-induced itch, which disproportionally
affects AA, MrgprX2 is a regulator of pseudoallergic reactions, and our recent study demonstrated a role for
MrgprX4 as a bilirubin receptor mediating cholestatic pruritus, but the function of MrgprX3 is unknown. Based
on preliminary data showing dramatic upregulation of MrgprX3 in lesional, pruritic, PN skin and because
MrgprX3 is the most highly expressed Mrgpr in keratinocytes, this aim will determine the cellular localization,
polymorphisms, and phenotypic differences in the expression of MrgprX3 in PN and AD patients with respect
to itch intensity and race.
 Our second aim will characterize upregulation of the IL-22 cytokine pathway in PN and AD patients
according to race and itch intensity. Our preliminary data reveals significant upregulation of Th22-associated
genes in lesional PN and AD skin as compared to healthy skin. Further, we found robust IL-22 expression from
human blood peripheral blood mononuclear cells in PN patients as compared to healthy controls. Thus, in this
aim we will determine circulating levels of IL-22 from plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a larger
sample of PN and AD patients with respect to race and varying itch intensity. We will also determine the
expression and cellular localization of IL-22 and Th22-associated related genes in PN and AD lesional skin.
Finally, we will test the hypothesis that MrgprX3 expression is regulated by IL-22 and Th22 associated genes.
 This project will provide important insights into the role of MrpgrX3, IL-22, and the interplay between
these mediators into the pathogenesis of itch in AD and PN in African American and Caucasian patients.
Importantly, the results will be correlated with race to determine the pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets
in specific patient populations. The knowledge gained from these studies will identify patients likely to benefit
from future treatments aimed at targeting itch in AD and PN."
11054844,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) use cannabis at a high rate, which exacerbates SZ symptoms and worsens
long-term prognosis. Recent studies suggest that while individuals with genetic risks for SZ are more likely to
use cannabis, cannabis users are also at a dually (i.e., genetically and pharmacologically) increased risk for the
expression of SZ related symptoms. The psychoactive substance in cannabis, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
targets the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) in the brain. I recently showed
that CB1R is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory axon terminals in the human dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC) – a region implicated in working memory impairments of SZ. Then, I found increased CB1R in
excitatory terminals, and decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals, in the DLPFC of SZ subjects without comorbid
cannabis use. Conversely, in a pilot analysis of THC-exposed rats, I saw decreased CB1R in inhibitory terminals
in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) – a functional homolog of the DLPFC – but no changes in excitatory terminals. I now
propose to expand on these results to characterize the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use
on terminal type-specific CB1R expression and signaling, and resulting functional alterations. I hypothesize that
individuals with SZ have terminal type-specific CB1R aberrations that contribute to impaired working memory.
THC exposure then intensifies these terminal type-specific CB1R changes, further worsening working memory.
I will test this hypothesis using the synergistic strengths of cross-species analyses, through a set of postmortem
and rat experimental Aims, to clarify the effects of findings observed in human samples with preclinical studies.
Multi-label immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy will be used to define the terminal type-specific CB1R
alterations in the DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use (Aim 1). Viral manipulations
and intravenous rat THC self-administration, followed by working memory tests, will be used to delineate how
terminal type-specific CB1R changes and THC exposure alter working memory (Aim 2). Proximity labeling and
targeted mass spectrometry will be used to compare terminal type-specific CB1R phosphopeptide alterations in
the DLPFC of SZ individuals with and without comorbid cannabis use, and the PrL of rats with and without THC
exposure (Aim 3). Integrated with the scientific Aims is training to 1) Develop expertise in translational studies of
SZ cortical cell and circuit pathology. 2) Acquire expertise in the design and execution of in vivo viral mediated
gene transfer. 3) Train in the design and execution of THC self-administration. 4) Enhance knowledge of GPCR
signaling biology using phosphoproteomics. 5) Learn advanced biostatistics to analyze complex postmortem and
rodent datasets. Achieving these Aims will identify the independent and additive effects of SZ and cannabis use
on terminal type-specific CB1R expression and signaling in the DLPFC, and the resulting functional alterations.
The training and knowledge gained will support future R01 testing strategies to rescue CB1R abnormalities, and
provide me with the necessary skills to establish a successful independent, NIH-funded research program."

Compared to non-Hispanic White women, Black women with breast cancer have a 41% higher mortality rate
and experience worse psychosocial outcomes, such as greater psychological distress and poorer health-
related quality of life (HRQOL). Current psychosocial support interventions are not culturally sensitive to the
lived experience of Black breast cancer survivors (BBCS), which is shaped by disproportionate and unjust
exposure to social determinants of health (SDOH) and life course stress. BBCS report a greater need for
emotional and informational support from other BBCS; therefore, psychosocial support interventions may be
optimally delivered by peer health workers (peers) who in the context of a formal intervention, provide culturally
sensitive support through the shared lived experience, knowledge, and characteristics of other BBCS. The
purpose of the proposed K23 award is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
peer-led, manualized, web-based support intervention to reduce distress and improve HRQOL among BBCS.
In aim 1, we will recruit and establish a community advisory board (CAB) to collaborate on all phases of the
study, including recruitment; developing and refining the intervention; piloting the randomized controlled trial
(RCT); and analyzing and disseminating the findings. In aim 2, we will co-design and iteratively refine a peer-
led support intervention through focus groups with BBCS (N=20) to identify the preferred content, format, and
delivery of the intervention. We will manualize and further refine the intervention through individual qualitative
interviews with a sub-sample of BBCS (N=10). In aim 3, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy (on reducing distress and improving
HRQOL) of the peer-led support intervention (N=30) (culturally sensitive educational support + peer support)
compared to the control arm (N=30). To isolate the effect of the peer, the control arm will include culturally
sensitive educational support delivered by an oncology nurse scientist (no peer support). Peer support will be
guided by their shared lived experience and principles of motivational interviewing. from trained peers will
provide culturally sensitive support to reduce distress and improve HRQOL of BBCS. The K23 will provide the
essential mentoring and training to become an independent investigator focused on providing equitable cancer
survivorship care for BBCS. The proposed mentoring team has the expertise to provide in-depth training to
achieve the following goals: (1) obtain knowledge and experience with clinical trial design and community
engaged (CEnR) methods to support the development and refinement of a peer-led support intervention
focused on reducing distress and improving the HRQOL among BBCS; (2) obtain knowledge and skills in
conducting research that incorporates multi-level social determinants of heath, especially as they pertain to
health disparities and distress among BBCS; and (3) prepare and secure R01-level funding to test the efficacy
of the peer-led support intervention in a larger, fully powered randomized controlled trial."
11176596,"Project Summary
Repair of traumatic injuries relies upon glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and related
extracellular cytokines collectively called GDNF family ligands (GFLs). GFLs interact with solubilized
forms of the GDNF-family receptors (sGFRα1–4) forming complexes which then can bind and
activate NCAM (nuclear cell adhesion molecule) and RET (REarranged on Transfection) receptors
leading to intracellular signaling and a range of responses conducive to neuronal connectivity.
GFLs have been tested in animals and in clinical trials. However, they have poor in vivo stabilities,
unfavorable tissue permeation characteristics, and are expensive to prepare with batch-to-batch
reproduciblity. Gene therapy approaches have also been attempted, but these are extremely risky
because continued expression leads to uncontrollable growth post therapy. Few small molecule
mimics of GFL•GFRα interface regions have been reported in the literature. This is surprising
because appropriate small molecules could cause conformational changes in sGFRαs transforming
them into NCAM/RET agonists which may communicate between cells (trans-signaling) to trigger
valuable responses for repair of the peripheral nervous system after trauma.
Preliminary studies feature design, synthesis, and testing of two mimics of the GDNF loop which is
responsible for most if the GFL•GFRα interface interaction (ie the interface “hot loop”). These loop
mimics bind GFRα1 (best so far Kd 240 nM), and are currently being tested in cellular models for
repair of traumatic injuries to the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
This application is to optimize these initial leads and test them more extensively. Year 1 will focus on
on design, syntheses, and GFRα1-binding affinities for similar “cyclo-organopeptide hot loop mimics”
by the PI (10 – 20 compounds). Free loop mimics with superior GFRα binding affinities, and samples
of ones covalently anchored to hyaluronic acid supports (which mimic the media around synapses),
will be selected for Aim 2. The PI is an expert on design and synthesis of growth factor hot loop
mimics; he will oversee that part of the work closely. In year 2 the emphasis will shift to testing the
best hot-loop mimics identified at that time in 2D and 3D-cellular models for PNS recovery from
traumatic injury. Active compounds will also be assayed to test if they cause intracellular activation of
NCAM and/or RET. That work will be overseen by Professor Sakiyama, the subcontractor on this
application, who has extensive experience with GFLs and supported GFLs, particularly GDNF, tested
2D and 3D cellular assays for neurite outgrowth on sensory and motor neurons. She is an expert in
neuronal repair."

11055097,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to investigate the potential of transcranial stimulation to enhance intelligibility in
speech mixtures in older adults struggling in these environments. Many older adults with and without
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) struggle with speech-on-speech (SOS) understanding, likely as a result of a
mixture of peripheral and central deficits in the auditory system. Whereas the peripheral deficits represent a
hard limit on performance, central deficits may be improved with experience and training. There are many
auditory training programs available that aim to optimize a listener’s performance in SOS environments, but the
benefits of these programs can be small and variable across listeners. Recent evidence shows that
transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) – a safe and non-invasive low level of current applied to the
scalp – can lead to improved speech-in-noise understanding in young normal hearing (NH) listeners and older
adults with SNHL during the course of stimulation. Furthermore, transcranial stimulation studies in other
domains show that it can enhance benefits from cognitive training in older adults, with effects persisting for
months. However, it is not known if tACS can enhance intelligibility or reduce listening effort for SOS in older
adult listeners specifically struggling with SOS understanding, or if tACS can enhance benefits from auditory
training during or beyond the course of stimulation. In this exploratory R21 proposal, older adults reporting and
demonstrating struggles in speech mixtures will be randomly assigned to Active tACS or Sham tACS groups.
All participants will be tested in the first visit on a baseline SOS recognition task, and again on a SOS task with
Active or Sham tACS. Participants will then complete two weeks of computer-based auditory training at home
(the Listening and Communication Enhancement, “LACE”, program; Sweetow and Sabes, 2006). Participants
will visit the lab twice during the LACE training period to undergo Active tACS or Sham tACS during the SOS
task. Listening effort will be assessed via pupillometry measured concurrently with the SOS task and via a
questionnaire through the LACE program. Performance on the SOS task will be re-assessed at 4 weeks
following enrollment in the study to assess retention of benefits. By comparing the in-laboratory change in SOS
performance and listening effort in the Active and Sham groups relative to baseline in the first visit, this project
aims to determine if tACS can improve speech intelligibility and/or reduce listening effort in listeners who
struggle with SOS (Aim 1). By comparing LACE performance and SOS performance and listening effort at all
subsequent visits, this project aims to determine if tACS can increase benefits obtained from an auditory
training program over the short and long term (Aim 2). Ultimately this work could significantly improve the
communication abilities of listeners with and without hearing loss who struggle with understanding in SOS
environments. This project coincides with NIDCD’s strategic plan of encouraging the development of new
technology to improve treatment."

Impaired pragmatic (i.e., social) language is a defining symptom domain of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
imposes significant burden on affected individuals and their families throughout the lifespan. A wealth of evidence
demonstrates that pragmatic abilities are highly heritable and are a primary feature of the broad autism
phenotype (BAP) seen in unaffected relatives of autistic individuals. Further, pragmatic language differences that
mirror those in ASD and the BAP are observed in carriers of FMR1 mutation conditions (e.g., fragile X syndrome
and the FMR1 premutation), implicating this high confidence ASD risk gene in the ASD pragmatic phenotype. In
addition to being valuable targets for intervention, pragmatic language abilities also appear to be sensitive to
genetic liability to ASD, and so can provide a window into the biological origins of ASD symptomology. Extensive
evidence from our prior work and current NIMH-funded R01 (R01MH091131) has reported overlapping profiles of
impaired pragmatic language and related molecular-genetic and neurobiological correlates in ASD and in FMR1
mutation carriers. In this project, we advance this work by investigating the mechanistic origins of these
differences, with a focus on motor-speech abilities shown to be disrupted in ASD and the BAP which are related
to pragmatic language skills, in carriers of the FMR1 premutation (PM), to illuminate gene-brain-behavior
pathways associated with this core ASD symptom domain. Preliminary data show robust differences in motor-
speech skills among PM carriers that are qualitatively similar to those observed in ASD and the BAP, and which
relate to high-order pragmatic-related abilities and neurobiological and molecular-genetic variation. Specifically,
Aim 1 characterizes the motor-speech skills that contribute to ASD-related pragmatic profiles in PM carriers
through a targeted battery of assessments indexing mechanistic contributors to pragmatic language including
speech articulation, audio-motor synchronization, rhythmic speech fluency, and auditory feedback control. Aim
2 examines associations between targeted motor-speech skills and profiles of core, high-order pragmatic abilities
in PM carriers. Finally, Aim 3 investigates both neural and molecular-genetic influences on motor-speech skills
and their relationship to broader ASD-related pragmatic profiles in PM carriers. Together, these aims will inform
the complex relationships between neurobiological and genetic markers, motor-speech mechanisms, and ASD-
associated pragmatic abilities that may be linked with FMR1-related variation. This theoretically driven, targeted,
and efficient study design will leverage rich and extensive existing data to uniquely reveal mechanistic and
biological origins of this significant ASD clinical symptom domain. Findings from this work may hold important
clinical-translational implications for the ASD and FMR1 communities, informing mechanistic intervention targets
and diagnostic markers for ASD and FMR1 mutation conditions, paving a pathway toward precision medicine
focused on underlying causes of impairment."
11057181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will extend methods for estimating daily temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter air
pollution at high resolution across large regions by utilizing NASA and new USGS satellite measurements to
generate estimated exposures at the neighborhood level across the Northeast US. This detailed exposure
record can be used in health studies to further consider extreme weather and air pollutant as a health risk.
These new daily models will be developed for 2007-2023 at a <1 km resolution and thus include billions of
point-day temperature, humidity, and particulate matter estimates. While it is well established that particulate
matter increases the risk of preterm birth, less is known about how extreme weather events (including
temperature and humidity) and air pollution contribute to the onset of spontaneous preterm birth.
Pathophysiology builds throughout a lifetime & during pregnancy, yet the onset of preterm labor and/or rupture
of membranes is acute. In this way, we investigate potential environmental triggers to ask, “Why today?”. The
epidemiologic application of these novel exposure models will be demonstrated by testing the association of
temperature, humidity, and particulate matter with a dataset of spontaneous preterm births and residential
addresses from a comprehensive New York statewide administrative database. We will use address-level
exposures in the 7 days prior to a spontaneous preterm delivery with matched days in the same fixed two-
week period as a comparison (time stratified case-crossover design) for 17 years of spontaneous preterm
births statewide – making this among the largest environmental epidemiology studies of spontaneous preterm
birth with more than 170,000 cases. Given the large number of cases and the variation in population
characteristics across New York State, the association between extreme weather, air pollution patterns and
spontaneous preterm birth will be further tested for effect modification by sex, race, gestational age,
urban/rural, and neighborhood deprivation. A follow-up analysis will use carefully phenotyped spontaneous
preterm cases from large hospital systems in Philadelphia. Our epidemiologic models will improve on prior
work on the acute impacts of extreme temperature and air pollution on preterm birth that have relied on coarse
exposure assignments via ecological time series models, inappropriately long time strata for case-crossover
comparison, or overly broad outcome definitions that included medically-indicated preterm births. Given the
global coverage of satellite remote sensing, our approach – which can generate daily exposure estimates that
are highly spatially resolved (<1 km) to capture ambient exposure at the home address – is broadly applicable
to better understand the role of extreme weather and air pollution as a stressor in both chronic and acute
health outcomes using big data registries."
11074894,"We are investigating molecular mechanisms of directed cell migration, a critical process in health and
disease, using Dictyostelium as a discovery tool to inform our studies of neutrophils, macrophages, and
epithelial cells. At the core of our working model are coupled Signal Transduction and Cytoskeletal
Excitable Networks, referred to as STEN and CEN which drive motility. The STEN integrates inputs from
directional sensing and polarity networks to bring about directed migration. In the last grant period, we
found that protrusions are governed by waves of coupled STEN-CEN activities and that manipulation of
negatively charged lipids on the inner face of the membrane can alter network excitability and control cell
behavior. The STEN-CEN concept is conserved in mammalian cells and the networks are hyperactivated
in transformed cells, augmenting motility and macropinocytosis. Since these processes require geranyl
geranylation, statins cause starvation of cancer cells. Finally, we found that vesicles internalized from
retracting protrusions carry “back” components to the rear of the cell contributing to polarity.
How do diverse cellular protrusions depend on the setpoint/threshold of STEN-CEN? We are
combining imaging, synthetic biological, and computational studies to prove that pseudopods,
lamellipods, forming phagosomes, and so on are closely related on a spectrum and interconvertible. We
will show that spatiotemporal patterns of activities and responses to acute molecular perturbations are
consistent across these protrusions and parallel those established in propagating STEN-CEN waves.
What explains the extraordinary coordination of activities in STEN and CEN? Surmising that charge on
the inner leaflet of the membrane is an organizer, we are 1) designing methods to directly monitor charge
in local regions; 2) determining how anionic lipids transiently decrease; 3) manipulating charge locally
with optogenetic systems; 4) examining how the location of key proteins is regulated by surface charge.
Is lowered STEN threshold a general property of transformed cells and can it be exploited? To address
this question, we are 1) comparing threshold indicators, such as propagating waves, with
macropinocytosis and statin sensitivity in a series of increasingly metastatic cell lines and organoids; 2)
identifying the essential geranylgeranylated proteins in STEN; 3) genetically engineering cells to increase
threshold to normalize cancer cells or further decrease threshold to induce cell death.
How does control of STEN and CEN at the cell poles mediate directional sensing and polarity? First,
using a novel suppression assay, we are screening kinase and substrate deficient cells to identify global
inhibitors. Second, we are studying membrane flow in a variety conditions to pursue our “reverse
fountain” model and it reconcile with alternate models that argue membrane flows from front to back.

The University of Cape Town Clinical Trials Unit (UCTCTU) is based at the Desmond Tutu
HIV Centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The CTU’s primary goal is to provide a highly
efficient, effective, and integrated Clinical Trials Unit that contributes to the global epidemic
control of HIV and Tuberculosis. The UCTCTU has the capacity, capability and competence
to deliver world standard clinical trials in HIV, tuberculosis, and STI treatment and prevention
in a broad range of populations.
One of the core advantages of the UCTCTU is its location in Southern Africa. Recent reports
estimate that of the 36.9 million people living with HIV globally, 25.7 million are living in sub-
Saharan Africa. Thus, the subcontinent faces significant challenges in delivering treatments
and methods of prevention but also stands to make a significant contribution to innovation
and progress. In addition to its key location, the UCTCTU provides world-class scientific
leadership, administrative support, and common infrastructure. This enables four well-
established, diverse Clinical Research Sites to contribute cohesively to the research agenda
of the four NIH funded networks. Each of the Clinical Research Sites are located in
communities around Cape Town where the burden of HIV, tuberculosis and other diseases
is high. Thus, the research agenda of the NIH is being fulfilled in communities where
treatment and prevention is needed most.
Based at the University of Cape Town, this CTU is accommodated and supported by an
institution that is consistently ranked the best university in Africa, with a Health Science
Faculty recently ranked in the Top 100 globally. All Clinical Research Sites have access to
high-quality laboratories, with arguably the finest scientific expertise and best medical
diagnostic and investigative resources in the country. The consortium of Clinical Research
Sites are all components and affiliates of the University of Cape Town and thus share
the same or similar management platforms, supporting and amplifying efficiencies and

11074755,"This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-
CA-24-029. Cancer is clearly a disease of aging. This is especially true in the case of skin cancer, which
is the most common form of human cancer, accounting for more than all other cancers combined in the
USA. The major objective of this U01 Supplement application is a mechanistic understanding of the
interactions between age-related changes in the dermal microenvironment and infiltrating immune cells
in the initiation of keratinocyte cancer. This application is based on the findings from our humanized
mouse model of tumor initiation in our accelerated dermal aging mouse model. This model expresses the
matricellular protein CCN1 in dermal fibroblasts and oncogenic HRas in epidermal keratinocytes. CCN1
expression in dermal fibroblasts (the source of elevated CCN1 in aged human skin) drives strikingly
accelerated dermal aging, characterized by fragmentation and disorganization of the collagenous dermal
extracellular matrix, and an aged fibroblast phenotype typified by reduced ECM production and increased
expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. The age-related dermal microenvironment enhances the
tumorigenic potential of oncogenic HRas and results in squamous cell cancer-like tumorigenesis.
Importantly, at the early stage of tumor initiation, we find substantial infiltration of activated immune cells
into the dermis in close approximation to the dysplastic precancerous epidermis. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the interactions between the aged-dermal microenvironment and infiltrating immune cells
critically enable tumor initiation. We propose to test this hypothesis by determining the global gene
expression profiles in individual dermal fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells in situ in the context of
their localization within the precancerous dermis. This aim will be accomplished by using the newly
developed most advanced spatial gene expression technology, Visium HD. Visium HD has a spatial
resolution of 2µm, which can reveal the comprehensive gene expression of individual cells and their
locations within the dermis. Thus, we will investigate the impact of the interactions between immune cells,
fibroblasts, and the dermal microenvironment during tumor initiation. For these studies Dr. Evan Keller
will join our research team. Dr. Keller is a Professor of Urology and Pathology and the Director of the
University of Michigan Medical School Single Cell Spatial Analysis Program and Co-director of The
Rogel Cancer Center Single Cell and Spatial Analysis Shared Resource. He will provide oversight of the
Visium HD spatial studies, data acquisition, quality control, data interpretation and management of
personnel. We are confident that the proposed study will provide novel insights into the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which the interactions between the aged dermal microenvironment and
infiltrating immune cells act in concert to initiate skin carcinogenesis."
11074982,"Project Abstract:
 Retrovirus intasomes are integrase (IN) multimers bound to two viral DNA ends that are capable of concerted
integration into a target DNA. Assembly mechanisms are unknown for IN multimers in different retrovirus
intasomes, whose structures contain four IN subunits (prototype foamy virus, delta retroviruses), or 4 to 8 (alpha
and beta retroviruses) or 4 to 12 and up to 16 subunits (lentiviruses). The 3-dimensional structure of different
retrovirus intasomes has revealed remarkable architectural diversities besides conserved structural features and
catalytic mechanisms. To understand the assembly mechanisms, we have determined 1) biophysically that the
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) tetrameric intasome is the precursor to the mature octameric intasome with four IN
dimers; 2) intasome assembly in vitro is controlled by the C-terminal “tail” region comprising the last 17 residues
of IN; and 3) the structure of RSV octameric intasome (containing four IN dimers and two viral DNA) and strand
transfer complex (STC) with four IN dimers and a viral/target DNA substrate. We will determine the structure of
RSV tetrameric intasome, a novel intermediate in RSV integration pathway by cryo-EM.
 We recently determined the structure of RSV octameric intasome by single particle cryo-EM at an overall
resolution of 3.2 Å. The conserved intasome core (CIC) that contains the catalytic center for concerted integration
had a resolution of 2.8 Å. The ensemble of conformations in the intasomes revealed significant dynamic flexibility
of the two non-catalytic distal IN dimers, along with some movement of the two catalytic proximal dimers
contained in the CIC, previously unrecognized in retrovirus intasomes. We hypothesize that there are ordered
conformational transitions between key intermediates in the assembly pathway of RSV intasomes and the
subsequent capture of the host target DNA. Our proposed studies will reveal how RSV IN first assembles the
precursor tetrameric intasome en route to the mature octameric intasome by the following Aims.
 Aim 1. Determine the structure of the RSV intasomes. We will determine the structure of the RSV
tetrameric intasome by cryo-EM. We will determine the first structure of intasome assembled with both U3 and
U5 LTRs to provide novel insights into the assembly of intasomes most similar to biological complexes.
 Aim 2. Determine the functional significances of tetrameric and octameric intasomes. We will use
structural and virological approaches to increase our knowledge of retrovirus integration, enhanced by near-
atomic structure-based missense mutagenesis of RSV IN. We will focus on the transition of the tetrameric
intasome to the octameric form to probe the independent functions of the distal and proximal IN dimers.
Virological effects of single-point mutations in IN will be measured by their effect on reverse transcription and
integration in virus infected cells and electron microscopy of virions to define phenotype under physiological
conditions. These projects will expand our understanding of intasomes functional states and determine how
higher order structures influence integration, and hence retroviral replication."

 This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as
NOT-CA-24-029. Bispecific T cell engagers (BTE) connect cancer cells to endogenous host T cells and induce
T cell expansion, cytokine production, and T cell-mediated cancer cell death independently of TCR-MHC-I
interactions. The FDA has approved blinatumomab (BlincytoR) for adult and pediatric pre-B cell leukemia and
amivantamab (RybrevantR)) for non-small cell lung cancer, and over 80 other BTEs are currently in clinical
development with 190 clinical trials underway (clinicaltrials.gov). However, little is known about how T cell
responses are regulated during BTE treatment of solid tumors, and a deeper mechanistic understanding is
critical to mitigate T cell exhaustion and promote efficacious tumor control and durable protection from relapse
in the long-term.
Leveraging our team’s collective expertise in BTE therapy, T cell exhaustion and regulatory T cells, the specific
goal of this supplemental project is to understand how Treg cells impact effector and memory-like T cell
responses, and efficacy and safety of BTE therapy in the immunosuppressive neuroblastoma (NB)
microenvironment. Based on the classic immunoregulatory role of Treg cells in infections, cancers and
autoimmunity, we propose that Tregs exert a dual role in BTE immunotherapy – (i) by suppressing effector
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses Tregs may limit the therapeutic efficacy of BTE in solid tumors. (ii)
Concomitantly, Tregs may exert a beneficial role by mitigating the systemic toxicity associated with T cell
activation. Hence, we hypothesize that transient ablation of Treg cells during BTE treatment will lead to
enhanced tumor control by driving vigorous effector CTL expansion, function and chemoattraction of new T
cells to the cold tumor microenvironment. We further propose that key immunoregulatory pathways in the
Treg/effector T cell axis may be leveraged to selectively augment effector and stem-like memory anti-tumor
responses while mitigating toxicity. This hypothesis is bedrocked in promising new data from our group
showing enhanced effector differentiation and improved tumor control upon ablation of Tregs, with significantly
tempered toxicity when Treg function is partially replaced through agonist CTLA-4 signaling.
Successful completion of these new collaborative supplemental studies will synergize with the overarching goal
of our U01 award to improve therapeutic outcomes for aggressive pediatric cancers such as neuroblastomas
(NB) and diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) through bispecific T cell engagers (BTE) by identifying potential new
targets in the Treg/effector T cell axis that may be leveraged in combination treatments of pediatric NBs,
DMGs, melanomas and sarcomas as well."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029.
 For colorectal cancer (CRC), the efficacy of current immunotherapies like checkpoint inhibition has been
disappointing, and scores of new strategies are being developed to bolster efficacy by targeting the numerous
features of the TIME that can impede robust and lasting anti-tumor immune responses. However, we have
little understanding of which features dominate the response to any given class of immunomodulators
since they all work together in complex ways and we don’t have retrospective patient data to probe since
most of these are not yet in clinical trials. Our overall goal here is to understand how various patient-
specific features of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME) govern
differential responses to different types of immunotherapies using our novel in vitro ‘avatars’ of the tumor-
immune circuit (‘TIvitars’) that we developed in our parent grant. To accomplish this, we are partnering with
clinician-scientist Prof. Ben Shogan, who runs a CRC biobank and collects corresponding stool samples for
microbiome analysis. We will establish and perform immunotherapy screens using human CRC tissues
from 20 patients comparing responses of each tumor to a broad range of immunomodulators that can (a)
compare efficacy among numerous therapies for each patient’s tumor in a response-predictive way, and
(b) correlate these responses with the molecular and cellular characteristics of each tumor (obtained from
standard -omics analysis of the samples) as well as with the patient’s microbiome (obtained from
sequencing stool samples). We hypothesize that by interrogating multiparameter -omics data and clinical
data using immunotherapy responsiveness data collected using TIvitar, we will identify tumor-intrinsic
features that contribute to immunotherapy responsiveness in CRC patients.
 In Aim 1, we will systemically characterize each patient’s tumor, gut microbiota, and systemic
immune status. For each patient, we will determine dominant tumor mutations, tumor gene expression
patterns, characteristics of the immune infiltrate, stromal features, systemic immune status, and microbiota
populations from fecal samples collected prior to surgery. In Aim 2, we will use TIvitar to determine each
patient’s response to a screen of different immunomodulators. In Aim 3, we will pair the immune response
data with the -omics data collected in Aim 1 to identify shared tumor, immune, or microbiota features that could
predict susceptibility to immunotherapy. The resulting data will form a completely unique dataset whereby
standard -omics data from cancer patients will be coupled with differential immunotherapy responses for
each."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the major cause of death from colon cancer and is
unresponsive to current approved immune checkpoint therapy. We have previously identified that tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of mCRCs are defined by high
expression of the marker gene SPP1. These TAMs interact with fibroblasts and immune cells in the TME and
generate a pro-tumorigenic niche that allows cancer to flourish at distant metastatic sites. However, our
understanding of the functional mechanisms by which SPP1+ TAMs promote colorectal cancer (CRC)
metastasis is limited.
 Our study focuses on understanding the influence of SPP1+ TAMs in migration and invasion in mCRC.
Leveraging sophisticated three-dimensional multi-cellular microfluidic devices, we will investigate TAM
functions in physiological model systems that maintain the complexity of the metastatic TME. Our hypothesis is
that SPP1+ TAMs can migrate into metastatic niches and further promote tumor cell invasion through
physiological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
 In Aim 1, we will compare the differences in migration potential of SPP1 +/+ and CRISPR knockout
SPP1 -/- macrophages in the presence of tumor cells. We will utilize advanced imaging techniques and time-
lapse microscopy in microfluidic models in the presence of extracellular matrix. We will also test if fibroblasts
have an additive role in promoting TAM migration.
 Aim 2 investigates the contribution of SPP1+ TAMs to mCRC invasion through the BBB in brain
metastasis. We will investigate this in a microfluidic model that mimics the in vivo human BBB. We will also test
if this process can be inhibited by therapeutic interventions such as pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic small molecule,
and an SPP1 neutralizing antibody.
 Together, we will identify the mechanisms by which TAMs promote CRC metastasis and develop
strategies to inhibit them."
11070690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this project is to elucidate the behavioral and neural mechanisms that mediate host seeking
and host invasion in skin-penetrating, human-parasitic nematodes. Nearly one billion individuals globally are
infected with skin-penetrating nematodes, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities with
limited waste management and healthcare infrastructure. Strongyloides stercoralis, the human threadworm, is
estimated to infect over 600 million individuals globally, resulting in chronic gastrointestinal infections, respiratory
distress, growth delays in children, and fatality in immunosuppressed individuals. Infections are expected to rise
with climate change and resistance to available anthelmintic drugs is a growing concern; therefore, elucidating
the mechanisms that mediate parasite host seeking and host invasion is crucial for developing novel strategies
to prevent and treat individuals infected with S. stercoralis and other parasitic nematodes.
 Skin-penetrating nematodes freely navigate the environment as developmentally arrested infective third-
stage larvae (iL3s) and rely upon sensory cues to seek out and infect new hosts. Previous studies have shown
that the iL3s of S. stercoralis and other skin-penetrating nematode species are robustly attracted to host-
associated odorants. However, how olfactory cues drive host-seeking and host-invasion behaviors remains
poorly understood, and the neural mechanisms that mediate odor-evoked behaviors have not been investigated.
This proposal hypothesizes that skin-penetrating nematodes have evolved unique neural and behavioral
responses to olfactory cues that facilitate specific host-seeking and host-invasion behaviors. To test this
hypothesis, I will investigate the odor-evoked responses of skin-penetrating nematodes at the behavioral and
neural levels. I will use S. stercoralis for these experiments because it is a human parasite with direct health
relevance and because several genetic manipulation tools have been successfully developed for this species.
Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will characterize and quantitatively analyze motility, host-seeking, and host-
invasion responses to host-associated and non-host-associated odorants in vitro and ex vivo. Experiment
outlined in Aim 2 will identify putative olfactory neurons and utilize in vivo calcium imaging and chemogenetic
silencing to functionally characterize parasite-specific olfactory neuron response properties. Collectively, my
results will illuminate how skin-penetrating nematodes respond to host-associated odorants and how these
responses enable the parasites to specifically target human hosts. This work will provide fundamental insights
into the poorly understood field of endoparasite chemosensation and may contribute to the development of novel
preventative and treatment methods to control nematode infections."

The current administrative supplement request is for a 12-month extension with funding to complete the
ongoing IGNITE Network pragmatic clinical trials, GUARDD-US and ADOPT PGx. The GUARDD-US and
ADOPT PGx trials have been underway since July 2020 and February 2021, respectively. These trials will help
determine the impact of implementing genetic testing on hypertension, depression, and pain therapies.
GUARDD-US: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with hypertension. People with African ancestry
(AAs) have the highest risk of CKD and kidney failure, the highest prevalence of hypertension, and the lowest
rate of blood pressure (BP) control. While this disparity is in part due to social determinants, ancestry has
biological underpinnings, and APOL1 high-risk genetic variants, exclusively found in AAs, increase kidney
failure risk 10-fold. We propose a genotype-guided trial to determine the effect of early vs. delayed knowledge
of a positive APOL1 genotyping result on 3-month systolic blood pressure (SBP). The clinical trial aims to
recruit African Americans with hypertension, with or without CKD, randomized to immediate versus delayed
return of APOL1 genetic testing. In those who are APOL1 negative, we will also conduct a pilot study to test
the impact of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing on SBP. ADOPT PGx: Pain and depression are conditions that
impact substantial proportions of the US population. The treatment of acute and chronic pain is challenged by
the difficulty of finding effective therapies while minimizing the risk of adverse effects or opioid addiction. For
depression, there are few clinically relevant predictors of successful treatment, which results in inadequate
therapy for many patients. We propose a prospective randomized pragmatic genotype-guided clinical trial that
tests the effect of genotype-guided therapy in three scenarios of patients: acute post-surgical pain, chronic
pain, and depression. For each scenario, participants will be randomized to genotype-guided drug therapy
versus usual approaches to drug therapy selection. Changes in patient-reported outcomes representing pain
and depression control using standard PROMIS scales define the primary endpoints. Secondary analyses
include safety endpoints, changes in overall well-being, and economic impact represented by differences in
healthcare utilization. A 12-month extension with funding is needed due to unanticipated network-wide delays
in launching each trial and shutdowns due to COVID-19. The funding requested in this administrative
supplement reflects the trial close-out needs and the costs associated with leading analyses and publication
costs for 13 secondary manuscripts."

The purpose of the NIDA Animal Genetics Program is to identify genetic, genomic, epigenetic variants,
physiology and brain functions that contribute to addiction-like behaviors, related behavioral endophenotypes,
and behavioral comorbidities to substance use disorder. During the past five years, our multidisciplinary and
highly collaborative consortium has been identifying gene variants that are associated with increased
vulnerability to compulsive-like cocaine use by performing the first GWAS using an advanced model of chronic
intravenous cocaine self-administration in N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS). We have also created the first
preclinical cocaine biobank which enables researchers who do not have the resources to perform chronic
intravenous self-administration or next-generation genome sequencing to perform advanced genetic, molecular,
and cellular studies to further our understanding of the biological changes underlying addiction-like behaviors.
While these efforts have been very successful in achieving the planned milestones, it has become clear that our
project would benefit from an even larger sample size. In particular, increasing sample sizes lead to exponential
rather than linear increase in the number of loci identified. Moreover, in the past five years there has been
tremendous technological advances in behavioral and genetic analysis that can be leveraged to provide
unprecedented access to identify the single nucleotide and structural variants that contribute to complex
behavioral endophenotypes of high relevance to cocaine use-disorders. The first goal of this competing renewal
is to double the sample size of the current GWAS to increase the number of gene variants identified and meet
the demands of the Biobank. The second goal is to use high-throughput behavioral phenotyping using
markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural network to identify behavioral
endophenotypes that can help predict and identify individuals with a resistant, mild, moderate, or severe
phenotype of cocaine addiction-like behaviors. The third goal is to use methodological improvements of the
genetic analysis, including the analysis of structural variants and tandem repeats, as well as enhanced
integration with gene expression data. The fourth goal is to strengthen the cocaine biobank infrastructure. This
project is likely to continue having a sustained and powerful impact on the field because it will provide an
exponential increase in the number of genetic loci identified, eQTLs and PheWAS analysis related to addiction-
like behavior; establish the first high-throughput behavioral motifs analysis of addiction-like behaviors using
parallel video-recording and automated machine learning analysis; identify novel behavioral endophenotypes of
vulnerability/resistance to addiction-like behaviors; and expand and improve the Cocaine Biobank offering and
infrastructure."
11075645,"Resident-to-resident aggression (RRA) in long-term care (LTC) is associated with preventable injury, suffering,
and serious psychological distress. One in five residents in nursing homes (NH) experiences RRA in a given
month. Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are at an even higher risk of RRA
due to cognitive impairment-related symptoms. However, RRA remains poorly understood. The race and
ethnicity of residents may play an important role in RRA initiation and escalation, risk/resilience factors,
consequences, and NH response systems. As NH populations are becoming increasingly racially/ethnically
diverse, focusing on the role of race/ethnicity in RRA allows for the development of a tailored prevention and
intervention to identify and address it, as many residents involved in RRA have ADRD and are unable to speak
for themselves. The goal of this equity-driven project is to systematically investigate the role of race/ethnicity in
the types, patterns, and circumstances surrounding RRA using the first prevalence cohort study of RRA, and
collecting additional stakeholder input with explicit consideration of the needs of residents with ADRD, to
develop, refine, and pilot-test a novel intervention. In Aim 1, I will leverage the first and only NIH-funded RRA
prevalence cohort study to qualitatively contextualizing and quantitatively examining the role of race/ethnicity in
RRA across individual, dyadic, and facility levels. Aim 2, I will gather input from multiple NH stakeholders to
improve understanding of the role of race/ethnicity in RRA, and to identify current and optimal intervention and
prevention strategies in residents with and without ADRD via mixed methods approach. In Aims 3a and 3b,
findings from Aim 1 and Aim 2 will be used to develop and refine a staff education intervention focused on the
role of race/ethnicity in RRA that may be integrated into an existing RRA intervention program that does not
currently have information regarding race/ethnicity. As a social scientist trained in public health research, I am
ideally positioned to spearhead this line of research, given my productive track record in social determinants of
health and elder mistreatment research. Through the award period, I will build upon my prior training to
develop new knowledge and skills in long-term care research (Aim 1; Training Objective 1); health equity
research (Aim 1; Training Objective 2); long-term care policy-making, advocacy, and leadership (Aim 2;
Training Objective 3); and behavioral intervention and implementation science (Aim 3a, 3b; Training Objective
3). Career development activities will consist of formal coursework, experiential learning and research
opportunities, and mentorship from experts in elder mistreatment, RRA research, health disparities, and
behavioral intervention development. This award will help me achieve my long-term career goal of being an
independent investigator with an impactful program of long-term care research focused on equity-driven,
evidence-based elder abuse prevention and intervention development and implementation for
racially/ethnically diverse older persons with ADRD.Project Summary remains unchanged by this supplement."

To help ensure that Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) data assets, data tools, and resources are
findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), the project will create a CFDE Training Center
(TC) responsive to the needs of biomedical researchers and current and future CFDE data programs. The
TC will serve as the central hub for training development, coordination, and evaluation across CFDE
programs and data initiatives.
Goals of the TC are to expand the Common Fund (CF) data userbase, enhance the confidence and
complexity of dataset usage, and increase awareness of the CFDE and resources. Team ORAU proposes to
accomplish with (1) training intentionally designed to address gaps in the training landscape, (2) outreach
activities and a mentoring program designed to support the growing community of CF users, and (3) the
establishment of a collaborative and supportive learning community. The TC will provide a dynamic
syllabus tailored to meeting the needs of a diverse community of scientists and medical researchers at all
experience levels, with focus on postgraduate students and early-stage investigators. The TC will design
and deliver customized trainings and training tools to address both broad data skills needs and the
customized needs of specific CFDE data initiatives and Data Coordinating Centers. Matching students and
early career scientists with experienced bioinformaticians and CF data users, the CFDE Mentoring Program
will provide technical and professional guidance to engage learners and encourage careers in bioinformatics
and data sciences. The TC recruitment and outreach functions will focus on engaging a diverse and equitable
set of trainers and participants. The learning community will be supported by internal processes and
functions put in place to facilitate communication and collaboration, including a CFDE Trainers Working
Group to share best practices and leverage shared resources, a Diversity Committee to ensure diversity,
equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is embedded in all activities and processes, a CFDE Landing
Page on the CFDE Portal providing a public gateway to CFDE training resources, and a CFDE Virtual
Community of Learners providing learning support and guidance to all training participants as well as a
platform for communication and engagement.
Development of the TC will require in-depth landscape analysis to assess, identify, and address the training
opportunities and needs of the CFDE community. The landscape analysis will include comprehensive gap
analysis, examining current tools and processes and training content, systematic literature review, key
informant interviews, CF research community survey, and other data gathering from National Institutes of
Health (NIH) stakeholders and biomedical community at large. Ongoing evaluation and assessment of
training activities will inform program enhancements and outcomes, achievements, and challenges will be
reported out to the common fund and other CFDE coordinating centers.
The TC will be developed and managed by a qualified and experienced team of training professionals and
data scientists from Oak Ridge Associate Universities (ORAU) and BioData Sage LLC, working in close
coordination with the CF and the CFDE stakeholder community. Project management processes and
controls will ensure that the TC and affiliated training programs and engagement activities are appropriate,
effective, and efficient. Program development and management will take an integrated flexible approach,
coordinating closely with NIH and integrating feedback and activities from across the CFDE to ensure

11078954,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver-related mortality/morbidity, and there is no
FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD. Advanced ALD conditions, including severe alcohol-associated
hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcohol-associated cirrhosis (deAC), have especially poor outcomes.
Indeed, the 90-day mortality for sAH is ~30%. Return to drinking impacts quality of life and mortality in these
patients. There are limited drug therapies or well-studied behavior therapies in this patient population. An optimal
approach would be the integration of AUD and ASLD care givers and therapies, but there are no guidelines for
this approach. Our proposed AUD/ALD team approach seeks to overcome the perceived stigma of alcohol
misuse which can adversely affect treatment seeking, quality of care and patient outcomes. The AlcHepNet study
was stopped at the interim analysis because of the unexpected 90% 90-day survival in sAH patients treated with
prednisone using the Lille stopping rule. These dramatic results need to be confirmed, and novel therapies such
as IL-22 need to be studied in sAH. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) improved MELD score
at 30 days and reduced drinking at 6 months in patients with moderate AH (e.g., novel AUD/ALD therapy).
Acamprosate appears to be the safest FDA-approved therapy for AUD in patients with ALD, but safety and
efficacy in severe ALD need to be evaluated. Take Control is a novel computer-based behavioral platform derived
from the NIAAA’s Rethinking Drinking. Based on preliminary data and identified gaps in knowledge, our overall
hypothesis is that an integrated management of ALD and AUD will improve clinical outcomes in patients
with sAH and decompensated ALD. This proposal will utilize the following AIMS:
Aim 1. Perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial of treatment for steroid-eligible patients with
severe AH. A masked study comparing daily prednisone for 28 days (with the 7-day Lille score-based stop rule)
vs. IL-22 fusion protein (F-652). Early intervention for AUD will include behavioral therapy platform (Take Control)
in all subjects and either acamprosate or placebo before discharge from the hospital. The primary endpoint of
the trial will be a composite measure of mortality, liver, and alcohol use related outcomes.
Aim 2. Evaluate Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis. In
patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to ALD, in whom corticosteroids are not effective, a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of LGG in combination with Take Control and locally accepted SOC for 6 months will be
performed. A composite measure (as in AIM 1) at 6 months will be the primary end point for this AIM also.
AIM 3. Build a platform for biosamples, data repositories, and patient registries to support site-specific

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest affects over 350,000 people in the U.S. annually, but only 10.8%
survive. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival, but rates of training in the
U.S. are low. It is recently required by law in 39 U.S. states that high school students learn CPR.
However, current methods of teaching CPR use outdated pedagogical strategies and expensive
devices. Previous data indicates that only 12% of students are able to perform high-quality CPR 6
months following standard training. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive video game
experience to teach CPR in classrooms. In phase I, we created an interactive digital film depicting a
dramatic cardiac arrest, a prototype “CPR Spring” to replace traditional CPR manikins, and a plan for
interactivity between the device and the film. Preliminary data showed that the interactive video alone
(without the paired CPR Spring) improved CPR skill acquisition and retention by 50% in high school
students, compared to standard classroom training. The CPR Spring device has properties that more
closely mimic a real human chest than competitor devices. The combined CPR Spring + Interactive
Film was feasible in a classroom setting, engaging to students, and easy to use for teachers.
In phase II of this grant, we will build upon the success of phase I to create a commercially-ready
interactive CPR video game experience. This experience will include a new interactive CPR film
featuring a female victim, addressing gender disparities in bystander CPR. This film will interact with
an improved version of the CPR Spring, which communicates wirelessly with the film through mobile
device-based app and school computer via the local Wi-Fi network, providing real-time CPR quality
feedback for each Spring simultaneously while the film is playing. The interactive CPR video game
experience will improve upon current methods of training, by being: 1) Emotionally Engaging via
realistic cardiac arrest film footage; 2) Multi-sensory, engaging tactile, auditory, visual, and
psychomotor skills; 3) Realistic, both the tactile feel of the CPR Spring AND the realistic film; 4) More
interactive, through answering team-based questions and receiving real-time CPR quality feedback;
5) Affordable and practical, as it does not require an instructor; and 6) Modern, mimicking a video
game experience. We will compare our video game method to standard CPR training in schools,
reporting outcomes including longitudinal CPR skill retention, engagement, and emotional response.
Our goal is to develop a commercially-ready product that is 1/10th the cost and 1/5th the size of
current CPR manikins and requires no instructor, thereby offering a low-cost, low-profile, more
effective CPR course. This product has the potential to become the predominant method for training
CPR in North America, which could lead to more saved lives after cardiac arrest."

 People with aphasia often experience challenges conveying their thoughts to unfamiliar communication
partners, which is critical for living independently and building new social connections. This line of research has
two long-term objectives: to improve unfamiliar communication partners’ comprehension of people with aphasia,
and to support people with aphasia in advocating for their communication needs. This project addresses these
goals with a focus on service workers, who interact directly with customers to provide goods, services, or
information. Being understood by service workers is often necessary to complete essential tasks such as
purchasing food and picking up medication. This project investigates whether service workers comprehend
speakers with aphasia more accurately when they have first read an aphasia identification (ID) card. Aphasia ID
cards contain written self-advocacy statements that disclose the speaker’s aphasia, define aphasia, and provide
guidance on how to communicate successfully. These statements have been shown to improve unfamiliar
communication partners’ attitudes (knowledge about aphasia, emotions, and behavior), which improves
communication experiences for people with aphasia. This project tests the central hypothesis that, by improving
unfamiliar communication partners’ attitudes, aphasia ID cards facilitate key language processes that improve
their comprehension of people with aphasia. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 160 service workers who
vary with respect to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and occupation. Half of the service workers will view an aphasia
ID card for a speaker with aphasia, and half will not. Then, all service workers will complete tasks measuring
their attitudes, language processing, and comprehension of service requests (i.e., requests for goods, services,
or information) produced by speakers with aphasia. Eye-tracking will be used to measure key language
processes that take place while service workers listen to the service requests. The Specific Aims are to
investigate how viewing an aphasia ID card affects service workers’ attitudes, language processing, and
comprehension when people with aphasia produce long pauses (Aim 1) and paraphasias (word-retrieval errors)
(Aim 2). By rigorously investigating the effects of aphasia ID cards on service workers’ attitudes, language
processing, and comprehension, this project will contribute to the long-term goals of improving unfamiliar
communication partners’ comprehension and helping people with aphasia self-advocate effectively."

This application is for a diversity supplement for Dr. Kayla Fike on the NIA funded DNA methylation in context:
Racial inequities in social adversity and vulnerability to the health impact of air pollution (R01AG074887). Black-
White inequities in healthy aging are well-known with Black adults experiencing greater risk of developing and
earlier onset of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and diabetes compared
to White adults. Neighborhood context has emerged as a potentially powerful determinant of racial inequities in
aging-related health conditions, including cognitive decline, and may be a key intervention site. Neighborhoods
include both social and environmental exposures important for healthy aging. Evidence indicates stark racial
inequities in exposure to segregated, under-resourced but over-surveilled and polluted neighborhoods. Pollution
and aspects of social adversity are often correlated and may operate cumulatively to result in racial health
inequities. Importantly, however, these chemical (i.e. pollution) and non-chemical (i.e., social adversity) stressors
may act synergistically, whereby exposure to social adversity can heighten vulnerability to the deleterious health
impact of even low levels of pollution. Yet, the environmental and social science literatures – even the
environmental and social epidemiology literatures – are largely separate. There is a pressing need to integrate
the study of these exposures given their likely cumulative and synergistic effects on racial health inequities in
order to direct effective interventions and policies. In addition to the gaps in our knowledge about the combined
impact of chemical and non-chemical stressors on racial inequities in healthy aging, there is a need to focus on
outcomes that may serve as biological pathways to numerous diseases. Research on either pollution or social
adversity has tended to focus on specific health outcomes. Focus on a single disease may underestimate the
overall health impact of these racially unequal exposures. It is critical to clarify the shared biological mechanisms
that underlie numerous chronic diseases to understand the full impact of pollution and social adversity on racial
health inequities. A growing literature points to the importance of epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation,
linking socioenvironmental context to health. Indeed, it may be that epigenetic processes are an important
mechanism through which inequities in both air pollution and social adversity are embodied. Our objective is to
identify underlying DNA methylation mechanisms linking neighborhood segregation and ambient and industrial
air pollution and social adversity to measures of healthy aging. Clarifying the role of neighborhood in racial health
inequities is critical, as neighborhoods are amenable to intervention. Identifying the role of DNA methylation
patterns reflecting racial segregation, including chemical and non-chemical stressors, can point to specific
disease etiologies and causal mechanisms effective interventions to eliminate racial inequities in healthy aging."

industry contacts) to discuss current controversies and future directions for clinical care and research in
peripheral nerve injury. There will be an emphasis on open discussions, forward thinking, exploring cutting-edge
findings, and building consensus."

The misuse and abuse of prescription pain relievers, such as oxycodone, contributed to the unprecedented
opioid epidemic in the United States. Despite substantial knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and behavioral
effects of oxycodone in various animal models, only a small number of candidate genes and neuroanatomical
systems affected by opioids have been studied. Recent technological advances in the field of single cell
genomics are promising avenues for the unbiased discovery and characterization of brain cell types that
respond to opioids.
In the parent R01 grant, we leverage a multi-omics methodology (Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene
Expression) to map the transcriptome and epigenome from the same cell across thousands of cells in brain
regions relevant to the effects of opioid exposure. To this aim, we will use a rat model of extended access to
oxycodone intravenous self-administration that recapitulates several neuroadaptations also observed in
humans with opioid use disorders (OUD). This approach provides an exceptional opportunity to systematically
explore the cellular diversity of the opioid system and, at the same time, the causative mechanisms that
regulate cellular states based on the associations between epigenetic changes and the expression of target
genes in individual cells. We will integrate this multi-omics methodology with rigorous computational
approaches to explore the cellular organization of the opioid system in multiple brain regions and different
stages of OUD progression.
 In this supplement request, we are extending the studies funded by the parent grant to focus on
glucocorticoid receptor (GR)--regulated enhancers. Specifically, we will generate GR binding profiles by
CUT&RUN and calculate the enrichment in specific cell types by integrating the single-cell omics datasets
produced by the parental R01."

11041890,"The development of effective HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in preclinical studies. To meet this need, the Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) provide NHP resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention modalities. The SVEU program will provide NIAID the ability to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines using NHP models in which thorough evaluations of systemic and mucosal immune responses can be conducted, vaccine efficacy can easily be tested, correlates of reduced risk of virus acquisition can be identified, and approaches to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of clinical vaccines can be conducted. The SVEUs will provide a responsive, flexible vaccine resource that is available to NIH-supported researchers and can support all stages of AIDS vaccine research, from preclinical evaluation or clinical testing of candidate AIDS vaccines, with the objective of identifying a vaccine that will generate immune responses able to prevent or control viral infection. The scope of the SVEUs includes housing and maintenance of NHPs, the conduct of studies supporting AIDS prevention research, with an emphasis on AIDS vaccines, support of a NHP breeding colony, and general administration and management of these activities."
11054710,"Project Summary
Malformations of brain development are a common cause of neurological disorders in children. The most
common of these neurodevelopmental disorders is the large group of malformations of cortical development
(MCD) characterized by disruption of the structure of the cerebral cortex (e.g., enhanced cell size, altered
lamination). Somatic mutations have been identified in regulatory genes of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR (mTOR)
pathway in the brain tissue of patients with these MCD collectively termed ‘mTORopathies.’ Focal cortical
dysplasia is a particularly challenging mTORopathy due to the presence of highly epileptogenic lesions within
the cortex that are often resistant to medication and/or difficult to resect. The most common genetic variants
causing FCD are found in genes that encode protein subunits forming the GATOR1 complex: DEPDC5, NPRL2,
and NPRL3- a negative regulator of mTOR signaling. Many studies have linked variants in DEPDC5 and NPRL3
to mTOR pathway hyperactivation, MCD, and seizures, but there few studies functionally validating or modeling
variants in NPRL2 and, currently, mTOR inhibitors are not used to treat epilepsy in these patients. This project
seeks to investigate the effects of Nprl2 loss in vitro and in vivo and to identify the mTOR-dependent
transcriptomic changes that occur as a result of Nprl2 KO. The results of this proposal stand to provide a deep
functional and transcriptomic understanding of NPRL2 variant associated phenotypes, provide pre-clinical
support for the use of mTOR inhibitors in effected individuals, and identify novel therapeutic targets downstream
of mTOR that may provide precision therapy options in the future."
11054711,"Project Summary: Developing disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases has been challenging, in part
because accurate statistical models to identify the optimal time for intervention do not exist. Models of how symptoms
worsen over time (i.e., the symptom trajectory) before and after a clinical diagnosis can help identify that optimal time.
These models can help pinpoint when a therapy could prevent a clinical diagnosis, or slow the disease after a clinical
diagnosis.
 Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy even for Huntington disease, a disease for which researchers
can track symptoms in patients guaranteed to develop it. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington disease
progresses slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before clinical diagnosis. This makes time to
clinical diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient's motor abnormalities will merit a clinical diagnosis sometime after the
last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom
trajectory before and after clinical diagnosis without full information about when clinical diagnosis occurs. The challenge
creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored covariate, time
to clinical diagnosis.
 Tackling this problem by modeling the distribution for time to clinical diagnosis has long been thought to be
the best strategy. For years, we and others worked to develop reliable distribution models, but we found that if the
model is even slightly wrong, we get biased estimates of how the symptom trajectory changes as a function of time
to clinical diagnosis. This bias causes problems for clinical trials because they are incorrectly powered to determine
if a therapy modiﬁes the disease course with statistical signiﬁcance. We began seeking a strategy that estimates the
symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis without needing to accurately model the distribution for
time to clinical diagnosis. Our team developed such a strategy for a related problem: estimating a regression model
that has a covariate measured with error. Like a right-censored covariate, when a covariate is measured with error,
the covariate's true value and distribution are unknown. Rather than ﬁnding the correct distribution, our nontraditional
strategy accurately estimates the regression model even when the distribution for the covariate is mismodeled.
 Our overarching objective is to develop a similarly robust strategy when we have a right-censored covariate, which
requires tackling challenges in three new areas: noninformative censoring (Aim 1), informative censoring (Aim 2), and
handling longitudinal measures of the symptom trajectory (Aim 3). Upon completion, our work will produce robust
estimates of the Huntington disease symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis. The work is timely,
given recent therapies that show potential for modifying the course of Huntington disease. Correctly powered clinical
trials will enable researchers to test these therapies and determine if they modify the disease course. Our strategy could
help design these clinical trials and push forward the science of Huntington disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."
11055238,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Early detection of Sjögren’s Disease (SjD) and its precursor autoimmune-Sicca Syndrome (AI-
Sicca), are unmet clinical needs. Serum anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies and biopsy focus score are
two key classification criteria of SjD by the 2016 ACR-EULAR 1. SjD is a complex disease. Clinicians
provide symptomatic treatment to patients as the symptoms of SjD are similar to other physiological
and pathological changes in the body including menopause, drug side effects and fibromyalgia
amongst others. This leads to a 3-year delay in initial diagnosis from the time the patients first seek
medical care. In addition, there is currently no test for the diagnosis of AI-Sicca.
In order to address this unmet clinical need, we have developed a saliva-based electrochemical
assay, electric field-induced release and measurement (EFIRM), that can screen, earlier detect and
risk assess onset of SjD, alternative to the current ELISA blood-based serology assay. Preliminary
data demonstrated: 1) EFIRM can directly detect and quantify salivary anti-SSA/Ro52
autoantibodies in SjD patients; 2) Salivary and serum anti-SSA/Ro52 are correlated in SjD and AI-
Sicca patients; 3) Salivary anti-Ro52/SSA IgA1 correlate to salivary gland focus scores. This R21
application will test the hypothesis in a large cohort of SjD and AI-Sicca patients that EFIRM, can:
1) detect anti-SSA/Ro52 and anti-SSB/La in saliva of SjD and AI-Sicca patients, and 2) salivary
IgA1 to SSA/Ro52 is associated with salivary gland tissue destruction as measured by focus scores.
Furthermore, monomeric versus polymeric forms for IgA1 to salivary SSA/Ro52 can discriminate
SjD from AI-Sicca patients. Should this hypothesis be validated, the EFIRM salivary anti-SSA/Ro52
and anti-SSB/La assays can be explored for early detection of SjD and AI-Sicca in prospective
multi-site clinical study as well as basic science mechanistic pursuits. In addition, saliva monitoring
of IgA1 to SSA/Ro52 can be hypothesis tested for monitoring AI-Sicca progression to SjD in a non-
invasive sample type (saliva).
Three specific aims are proposed for this project. Specific Aim1: Acquire and Characterize Clinical
cohorts of SjD, AI-Sicca and matched control subjects. Specific Aim 2: EFIRM quantitative
assessment of anti-SSA/Ro52 and anti-SSB/La in saliva of SjD, AI-Sicca and Controls. EFIRM
SSA/Ro52 and SSB/La autoantibody immunoassays will be performed on 210 SjD, 210 AI-Sicca
and 315 controls subjects (blinded and randomized). Hypothesis testing of saliva SSA/Ro52 and
SSB/La autoantibodies to discriminate 1) SjD vs AI-Sicca; 2) SjD vs Controls; 3) AI-Sicca vs
Controls and 4) (SjD + AI-Sicca) vs Controls. Specific Aim 3: Quantification of monomeric and
polymeric anti-SSA/Ro52 IgA1 in saliva of SjD and AI-Sicca patients."
11057384,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A significant number of pediatric neuromuscular and neurodegenerative conditions are caused by recessive
gene mutations resulting in loss of both maternal and paternal copies of a gene. These genes may encode for
proteins that play critical roles in cell differentiation, cell survival, and/or cell function(s). Current medical
management strategies attempt to delay disease progression or minimize symptoms of these conditions, yet
they do not address the underlying genetic deficiency. Gene replacement therapy is a treatment approach that
provides back to cells a functional copy of a gene, thereby overcoming the deficiency caused by genetic
mutations and permanently rescuing cell differentiation, survival, and/or function to a degree that the disease is
halted or prevented entirely. This approach utilizes an AAV9 virus to deliver functional copies of a gene to cells
of interest based, in part, on how the therapy is administered. Gene therapies have potential to revolutionize
treatment of pediatric diseases, as was demonstrated recently by the FDA approval of a gene therapy for spinal
muscular atrophy. As part of this study, we are testing a novel gene therapy for childhood-onset striatonigral
degeneration, a severe progressive neurologic disease caused by recessive mutations in the VAC14 gene.
Patients with this condition develop signs of neurodegeneration in the first half-decade of life that progresses
rapidly and results in severe neurologic and neuromuscular deficit that is not responsive to current medical
treatments. To study this further, we engineered the first viable pre-clinical mouse model of this condition (termed
Vac14ducky). Vac14ducky mice develop neurologic disease associated with accumulation of vacuoles within the
brain cortex, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. The vacuolization observed in Vac14ducky mice is similar to
vacuole formation previously demonstrated in patient-derived fibroblasts. We developed a novel gene therapy
product (AAV9-hVAC14opt) expressing the human VAC14 gene transcript, and using our novel Vac14ducky mice,
we performed preliminary in vivo efficacy and toxicology evaluations. Following a single intrathecal injection at 7
days of age, our results thus far demonstrate that AAV9-hVAC14opt successfully rescues overall health and
motor function in adult Vac14ducky mice. Additionally when treating control mice, AAV9-hVAC14opt showed no
detectable toxicities. These preliminary results suggest AAV9-hVAC14opt is a potential novel gene therapy for
the pediatric VAC14-associated neurodegenerative disease. The study proposed here will test a dose-response
that is required for an IND application. Aim 1 determines the minimal effective dose of AAV9-hVAC14opt needed
to provide therapeutic benefit in Vac14ducky mice as well as in the more severe mouse line Vac14ingls. Aim 2 tests
the post-symptomatic treatment efficacy utilizing Vac14ducky mice as well as Vac14ingls mice. The complementary
Aims of this proposal will provide critical evidence demonstrating AAV9-hVAC14opt as a novel gene therapy for
this severe pediatric condition. At the completion of this study, we will be prepared to proceed toward an IND
application for eventual testing in patients."

This K18 Career Enhancement Award will provide 2-years protected time for Dr. Christopher Morrison (Assistant
Professor of Epidemiology, Columbia University) to become a leader in applied prevention science, with new
content-area expertise in firearm injury prevention. A program of collaboration with four new senior colleagues,
coursework, and research will allow him to accomplish three Training Objectives—A) to develop comprehensive
skills in leadership in firearm violence prevention research and policy; B) to develop comprehensive skills in
designing and implementing cohort studies; and C) to develop comprehensive skills in community engagement
for firearm violence prevention. Dr. Morrison will accomplish this training in the Department of Epidemiology at
Columbia University with a Visiting Scholar position at the Yale New Haven Hospital—Violence Intervention
Program (YNHH-VIP). This training is tailored specifically to develop expertise necessary to advance the science
of firearm violence prevention, including by leading the development of protocol for a multi-site prospective cohort
study for people at risk of experiencing firearm violence. Preventing firearm violence is a high priority for
research, but data are sparse. A social ecological systems framework provides a theoretical basis for
understanding the complex processes that contribute to individuals’ risks for firearm violence victimization and
perpetration, and emphasizes that contributors to firearm violence operate at multiple scales of organization
(e.g., individuals, households, neighborhoods, cities, states) and over the lifecourse. To examine these complex
processes we require longitudinal data collected at the individual level over many years, including detailed
measurement of outcomes and theoretically relevant exposures related to firearm violence. We will use data
from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which is the largest longitudinal
study in the US that includes measures of firearm violence perpetration and victimization, as well as critical
contextual measures that are theoretically relevant for firearm violence prevention over the lifecourse. The
specific aims are: 1) To assess longitudinal relationships between social ecological exposures during
adolescence and trajectories of firearm violence perpetration into adulthood; 2) To assess longitudinal
relationships between social ecological exposures and nonfatal firearm violence victimization over the lifecourse;
and 3) To assess longitudinal relationships between social ecological exposures during adolescence and fatal
firearm violence victimization into adulthood. Research activities will complement the collaboration and
coursework portions of the proposed career development plan, provide ideal opportunities to apply new skills,
and ultimately consolidate the candidate as a leading prevention scientist conducting high-impact studies,
including expanding available interventions to reduce firearm violence."
11072367,"Abstract. Physiological and psychological factors, such as homeostatic needs or emotional state, underlie the
decisions we make. A growing body of evidences suggests that these factors shift the baseline firing rate of
neurons across the brain, thereby changing the initial conditions that inform our decisions. The goal of the
proposed research is to understand how internal states, a term that encompass these factors, are represented
in the brain and how they may alter decision making. In the remainder of my graduate training under Prof. Katalin
Gothard (the F99 portion of this application), I will evaluate the role of interoceptive afferent signals signals
originating in the body and communicated to the brain via the vagus nerve and spinal cord, in driving baseline
firing rate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during an approach-avoidance conflict task. To do this, I will
selectively manipulate the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone in the viscera using
glycopyrrolate, a pharmacological agent that does not cross the blood-brain barrier but blocks parasympathetic
muscarinic receptors in the body. I will record neurons from the ACC of rhesus macaques while they perform an
approach-avoidance conflict task before and after glycopyrrolate administration. Preliminary results indicate that
this manipulation increases avoidance behavior. I hypothesize that the sympathetic-dominated visceral state
induced by glycopyrrolate will significantly alter the baseline firing rate of ACC neurons, and that the new baseline
firing rate will be predictive of increased avoidant decisions. Through this project, I will receive training in the
behavioral training of animals, neurophysiological techniques, and computational approaches to data analyses.
My co-sponsor, Dr. Aaron Batista at the University of Pittsburgh, will help me use the “computation through
dynamics” framework for the analysis of my data. For my postdoctoral training (the K00 portion of this
application), I propose to evaluate the role of the ACC in driving prosocial decision making and generating other-
oriented value representations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). I will record neurons from the dlPFC
and optogenetically inhibit projection neurons in the ACC while marmoset monkeys perform a social decision-
making task. I hypothesize that inhibiting the ACC, which has been shown to respond more when conspecifics
are rewarded than when the monkey itself receives a reward, will reduce prosocial behavior and shift the baseline
firing rate of dlPFC neurons toward firing rates that are predictive of antisocial decisions. This project will evaluate
the neural circuits that underlie prosocial behavior in marmosets and provide me with critical training in the use
of causal genetic manipulations in non-human primates. Overall, the training I will attain by performing these
experiments will prepare me for a career as an independent researcher where I will continue to study how
internal and external signals affect social and cognitive decision-making."

This proposal requests partial support for an international meeting on Myogenesis as part of the Gordon
Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) series to be held at the Renaissance
Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort Lucca (Barga), Italy June 7-13 2025. The international meeting on Myogenesis has
historically been viewed as one of the preeminent skeletal muscle meetings, attracting speakers and attendees
from around the world. A major goal of the 2025 Conference is to identify mechanisms that contribute to both
healthy physiological function and, when dysregulated, muscle pathology during aging or disease. Leaders in
the field will present recent unpublished data to educate conference attendees while stimulating interactive
discussion amongst the group. Additional program events including poster sessions, scheduled social events,
local outings, organized mentoring and networking tables at mealtimes, and informal gatherings in the
afternoons will ensure maximal levels of interaction between established scientists and junior
scientists/trainees: this meeting has historically been rated by attendees as extremely informal and collegial
with excellent interactions between trainees and more senior researchers. Thus, we expect the 2025
Myogenesis GRC will provide an ideal scenario to stimulate new breakthroughs in muscle biology and to
benefit attendees at every professional level. In addition, four afternoon and evening poster sessions will
stimulate interactions between all attendees. We will also provide education, networking opportunities, and
career path mentoring to junior scientists through the GRS, a two-day conference program targeting graduate
students and postdocs that takes place immediately preceding the GRC. The GRS will conduct four sessions
of talks and two poster sessions by graduate students and postdocs. Moreover, during the GRC, 4 sessions of
""poster previews"" will provide a forum for junior scientists to highlight their work and receive feedback from
other participants (approximately 50% of trainees attending will present in this forum). These activities
represent a unique opportunity for the next generation of scientists to present their research on myogenesis,
interact with their peers, and form new collaborations. Achieving these aims will place the field in a better
position to accelerate the advancement of muscle biology and thus the development of new avenues to
promote muscle health. The venue of the conference at Il Ciocco Italy offers a relaxing atmosphere conducive
to creative thinking and the exchange of ideas that will benefit attendees at every professional level. Thus, we
expect the 2025 Myogenesis Gordon Research Conference will provide both a stimulating program and an
ideal setting for attendees to advance their understanding of skeletal muscle biology."
11075692,"Chemotaxis occurs during a number of key physiological events including angiogenesis, embryonic
development and wound healing. It also contributes to disease progression in pathological conditions such as
cancer metastasis and arthritis. The goal of the current proposal is to reveal how biochemical reactions and
physical characteristics, such as membrane curvature, deformation, and assembly phase, interact with one
another in achieving dynamic, accurate yet highly efficient cell migration. Chemotaxis has been understood
mainly in the perspective of signal transduction, while if and how physical properties of membranes play a role,
and how they interact with signal transduction remain largely unknown. By newly developing and implementing
a series of molecular actuators that can directly probe membrane properties with high spatio-temporal precision
inside lively migrating cells, we will reveal an interplay between signal transduction and membrane mechanics.
What molecular mechanisms generate local membrane curvatures developing into filopodia and
lamellipodia? In sensing chemoattractants, cells polarize by undergoing asymmetric membrane deformation
consisting of filopodia and lamellipodia at the front, and membrane retraction at the rear. We recently found that
curvature-sensitive proteins are a missing link between actin cytoskeleton and membranes. The result made us
hypothesize that actin machinery and curvature sensing and remodeling proteins, when properly modulated in a
feedback loop, are sufficient to produce desired types of membrane deformations such as lamellipodia and
filopodia. We will thus identify a particular combination of Rho GTPases, actin regulators, and BAR proteins, and
the molecular logic thereof, that are responsible for formation of filopodia and lamellipodia.
How do signaling components in migrating cells respond to membrane deformation? Migrating cells
exhibit dynamic morphological changes at plasma membranes and nuclear envelopes “as a consequence” of
cytoskeletal rearrangement regulated by signal components. To explore a possibility that membrane deformation
talks back to cytoskeletal and signal components, we will deploy molecular actuators that can directly deform
membranes. We will then quantify subsequently emerging activity of signaling components such as receptor
tyrosine kinases, PI3K, and small GTPases, as well as transcription factors such as YAP and Elk.
How does the phase-separated cytoskeletal biomolecular condensate play a role in membrane
deformation? Actin networks can undergo formation of biomolecular condensates at the plasma membrane due
to weak multivalent interactions among actin regulators. To examine the physiological importance of such phase
separation events, we will adapt molecular techniques to assemble or disassemble the condensates. These
operations will uniquely achieve gain- or loss-of function manipulations without altering an amount of the
molecular constituents; what is altered is their physical assembly status. We will characterize cell migration
phenotypes before and after deploying phase manipulations."
11076591,"7. Project Summary/Abstract (Parent Cyber GEMS study, R01DK124427)
There is strong evidence that poor glycemic control in the hospital is common. Given the known
consequences of uncontrolled blood sugars during a hospitalization (e.g., infection, serious neurological
and cardiac complications, mortality, longer lengths of stay, readmissions, higher healthcare costs),
health systems devote significant resources to developing protocols for improving glucometrics.
Surprisingly, despite the widespread use and demonstrated effectiveness of continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) for ambulatory glucose management, CGMs are not currently used in any US
hospital. Therefore, the long-term goal to develop Cloud-Based Real-Time Glucose Evaluation and
Management System (Cyber GEMS) is to provide an effective, real-time solution to augment existing
processes, to provide a valuable test of real-world effectiveness, while capitalizing on standardized
algorithms to facilitate sustainability and scalability to other systems and at-risk populations. The
innovative intervention will enable hospital care teams to take immediate steps based on the wireless
transmission of glucose data from the Dexcom G6 device, sent to a Digital Dashboard, where
integration with existing real-world hospital processes can provide immediate prioritization to prevent or
correct impending hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events. The first step toward this long-term
goal is a randomized controlled trial, defined as a Phase III/IV definitive clinical trial that in turn
establishes efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention. Aim 1 will establish the effectiveness of
Cyber GEMS versus Usual Care (UC) in increasing the % time patients are in-range and decreasing %
time in hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia during hospitalization. Simultaneously, Aim 2 will
evaluate the effectiveness of Cyber GEMS versus UC in decreasing hospital-acquired infection risk.
The described Digital Dashboard is progressive, as it facilitates real-time, wireless transmission of
glucose data of a large volume of patients simultaneously; automatically identifies and prioritizes
patients for intervention; and detects potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes – all at a reduced
burden than current methods of stratification and review. The uninterrupted coverage by telemetry,
coupled with efficient and remote diabetes specialist oversight in Cyber GEMS is a scalable, novel,
team-based approach to maximize the use of continuously streaming CGM data for optimal glucose
management. The work proposed pushes the limits of these challenges by providing evidence,
identified by a team-based approach to glucose management in an underserved and understudied
population, supplementing prior data designed to improve outcomes among high-risk patients with T2D
and related cardiometabolic conditions."
11076620,"Background: Providing timely access to health care has been a long-standing VA goal that has been re-
emphasized by the Commission on Care. To improve access to care, VA implemented the Veterans Choice
Program in August 2014, which provides eligible Veterans the option of receiving care from community
providers paid for by VA. Currently, there is a substantial gap in scientific evidence on the effect of the Choice
Program and other VA community care programs, particularly in regards to the degree the program has
improved access to care. More generally, non-VA literature examining the effect of greater provider options
has focused on changes in utilization, but has not assessed the value of improved patient choice. The
development of measures that capture the value of greater provider options is methodologically challenging
because patients’ preferences are not directly observed and value encompasses many dimensions of access
(e.g., travel distance, appointment wait times, provider quality, etc.). To address these evidence gaps, we
propose the development and examination of new measures capturing the value of provider options to
Veterans using state-of-the art econometric methods. Greater scientific evidence to help VA provide enhanced
choice for Veterans through the Choice Program and future VA community care programs is consistent with
the VHA FY 2018-2019 Operational Plan. This study addresses the ORD-wide Learning Health Care System
priority area and HSR&D’s Access and Health Care Systems Change major priority domains.
Objectives: The objectives of this study are to: 1) develop new econometric method applications to
quantitatively measure the value of greater access to providers from the perspective of Veterans and 2)
examine the relative importance of local area and provider characteristics in determining Veterans’ value of
having improved access to providers.
Methods: This observational study will examine VA administrative data and existing public data characterizing
outpatient providers. In Aim 1, we will use VA administrative data to identify: 1) Veterans eligible for the VA
Choice Program in 2016, 2) VA and Choice outpatient providers and 3) utilization of outpatient services from
VA facilities and through the Choice Program. We will analyze Veterans’ revealed preference for providers
using econometric random utility models. These models assume patients select the provider that yields the
greatest benefit, given all available options. We will empirically estimate Veterans’ choice of provider within the
random utility framework using a nested multinomial logit model (NMNL). We will then use parameter
estimates and predictive margins from the NMNL model to calculate the value of greater provider options
through the Choice Program. Specifically, econometric models will calculate Veterans’ willingness to pay
(WTP), which represents the maximum dollar amount an individual would theoretically pay for greater provider
options. In Aim 2, we will apply econometric decomposition methods to models developed in Aim 1 to assess
the influence of key provider and local area characteristics in determining value. Notably, we will leverage
novel data linkages between VA administrative data and public use data capturing an extensive set of provider
characteristics.
Statement on Next Steps: We will develop a simulation tool designed for non-researchers that incorporates
study results to estimate the value to Veterans of a specified set of provider options (i.e. a community care
network). This tool will provide the ability for operational partners to assess the adequacy of community care
networks and establish the business case of “what-if” scenarios. Stakeholders will be able to adapt to changing
conditions through simulating the hypothetical addition and subtraction of providers within a community care
network. This simulation feature will facilitate future analyses to ensure community care networks include high
quality providers that best match Veterans’ preferences."
11075555,"Cognitive impairment due to neurodegeneration plagues 20% of the world population by age 65, yet the mechanistic underpinning of pathogenesis is unknown. The abnormal cytosolic accumulation of TDP43 (transactive response DNA binding protein) is found broadly across neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Notably, the severity of TDP43 accumulation correlates with cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, my long-term goal is to determine the relationship between TDP43 function and cognition using integrative multi-omics to improve our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of AD, FTD, and ALS. To determine how TDP43 dysfunction underlies cognitive impairment in FTD and ALS, I am using TurboID- based proximity labelling to identify TDP43 protein interactions in the adult brain of an FTD and ALS mouse model. TDP43 interactions in the healthy adult brain consist of many (~25%) synaptic proteins and TDP43-ribosomal interactions are enriched in synaptosomes. Taken together, this is consistent with previous studies showing TDP43 functions at the synapse by transporting RNA condensates for local translation. I found the presence of TDP43Q331K, a causative mutation of FTD and ALS, enriches synaptic protein-TDP43 interactions. This suggests that the role of synaptic TDP43 may be a key molecular mechanism alteration in FTD and ALS pathogenesis. TDP43’s role in local translation is activity dependent. Therefore, I used the speed of TDP43- TurboID biotinylation to capture changes in TDP43 interactions upon neuronal activity. Neuronal activity induced TDP43-glycolytic enzyme interactions. This is notable because glycolytic enzymes are known to concentrate into RNA dependent condensates upon neuronal activity to enhance energy production at the synapse, and TDP43 is a well-known scaffold for RNA dependent condensate formation. Given glycolytic perturbations are associated with plaque formation, synaptic loss, and cognitive impairment, in the F99 phase of this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that upon neuronal activity, TDP43 acts to create condensates of glycolytic enzymes to enhance glycolysis at the synapse. Additionally, I will determine if TDP43 dependent glycolytic alterations are present in an FTD and ALS mouse model as predicted by glycolytic reductions in FTD and ALS patients. Neuronal activity dependent TDP43 interactions also suggest synaptic TDP43 function may link back to its well-known role in splicing and transcription. In the K00 phase of this proposal, I will use a multi-omic approach to determine if TDP43 relays information from the synapse to the nucleus to regulate gene expression and if dysfunction of this mechanism promotes the splicing and transcriptional alterations seen in FTD and ALS."
11080169,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there
are no open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and recording
available to researchers. As a result, progress towards bioelectronic clinical therapies is hampered by the
significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles faced by researchers to gain access to the few commercial
implantable neuromodulation technologies for early clinical studies. The few clinical closed-loop implantable
neuromodulation systems presently available are not suitable for the many bioelectronic medicine applications
envisioned, as they lack key functional modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, most use closed
architectures (e.g., the use of custom ASICs instead of commercial over-the-shelf components) and proprietary
software, limiting the ability to adapt such systems for different clinical indications.
 To address these shortcomings, the overall objective of this HORNET OpenNerve Platform is to develop and
disseminate a fully open-architecture and open-source implantable system for autonomic nerve stimulation and
end-organ sensing. In this administrative supplement, we will perform short-term and long-term validation of the
OpenNerve Platform functionality in large animals for closed-loop cervical vagus nerve stimulation and
glossopharyngeal nerve stimulation for treatment of stroke-induced dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. The
OpenNerve Platform includes an external charger and controller, implantable pulse generator, and an assortment
of implantable leads for nerve stimulation and internal organ sensing. The use of vagus nerve stimulation for
treating stroke -induced dysphasia and aspiration pneumonia was selected based on potential clinical indications
that are of interest to the NIH SPARC program."

referred to as Latino) community, are substantially underrepresented in cancer research. This creates missed

heterogeneity in the Latino population with respect to genetic ancestry, sociodemographics, health behaviors,
and risk factors is often overlooked, leading to unaddressed health disparities across diverse Latino communities
(e.g. Mexican, Central/South American, Puerto Rican, Cuban). For example, in colorectal cancer (CRC),
evidence suggests that Puerto Rican and Cuban Latinos individuals may experience worse CRC mortality than
Mexican Latino and non-Hispanic white individuals, even after controlling for sociodemographic factors, stage
and access to care. To facilitate investigation of biological contributors to CRC disparities within the Latino
population, our team established the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3) in 2019. The parent award for
this proposal (R01CA248931) leverages LC3 data and biospecimens to uncover how ethnicity, genetic ancestry,
epidemiologic factors, and clinical variables independently influence immune responses to CRC. This is timely
and critical research as immunotherapy has been a paradigm-shifting strategy for saving lives, but it has not
worked in all people. We and others have shown the importance of tumor-associated T cell responses as positive
prognostic and predictive indicators, as well as substantial differences in immune “hot” tumors across racial and
ethnic populations. LC3 is a unique resource, but Puerto Rican and Cuban communities, the groups experiencing
the highest CRC mortality burden, need greater representation. To begin filling this gap, we launched a pilot
study using institutional funds at Cleveland Clinic. The Cleveland Clinic Latino Epidemiology (CCLE) Cohort,
which will become a sub-cohort of LC3, began accruing patients with CRC in northeast Ohio (Cleveland) and
southeast Florida (Weston), with all regulatory and operational details implemented as of February 2024 (i.e.
IRB approval, Spanish-speaking research coordinators, patient questionnaire, biospecimen collection). This
supplement will build upon institutional commitment for recruiting, collecting survey data, and obtaining germline
samples for 100 CCLE participants by permitting tumor somatic and immune landscape characterization on a
subset for comparisons across Latino groups, which cannot otherwise be supported. In Aim 1, we will integrate
demographic (e.g. age, sex, country of origin), social elements of health (e.g. area deprivation, BMI, physical
activity), and clinical (e.g. survival) data from CCLE participants into the LC3 pipeline. In Aim 2, we will obtain
and pathologically review tumor tissue from 50 of these CCLE participants. In Aim 3, we will compare T cell and
somatic mutational profiles from LC3 tumors, including CCLE, by country of origin and genetic ancestry. The
proposal is feasible in 1 year and will facilitate multi-level ethnic disparities research by the scientific community."
11050356,"The anterior pituitary functions as the endocrine core of the organism, regulating hormonal synthesis and
secretion to effect adaption to changing metabolic and reproductive needs. The distinct pituitary hormone-
producing cell populations are known to possess remarkable plasticity of fate. However, the underlying
mechanisms that mediate pituitary cell plasticity in response to changing hormonal demands have not been
established, which is a major gap in knowledge. While it is recognized that stem cell differentiation and
cellular homeostasis are directed and regulated at multiple levels including gene transcription, signaling,
epigenetic and chromatin remodeling, these processes appear to be particularly sensitive to mechanisms that
impinge upon the control of mRNA translation. Identification of the molecular mediators that
regulate cellular plasticity within pituitary hormone-producing cell lineages would present a
valuable resource for therapeutic intervention to promote tissue regeneration or to oppose
cancer progression. The mRNA translation control protein, Musashi, plays a critical role in mediating
physiological and pathological stem cell function in many tissue types and has been shown to be broadly
expressed in the adult anterior pituitary in non-stem/progenitor cell populations to modulate hormone
expression. This study will focus on mechanisms by which Musashi differentially regulates distinct target
mRNAs, its mode of action and contribution to cell fate plasticity and its relevance to adult human pituitary
function. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the physiological mechanisms that control
pituitary cell fate determination. Specifically, the overall objective of this application is to assess the role of
regulated mRNA translation in general, and the Musashi protein specifically, in mediating adaptive changes of
cell fate in the pituitary. We will also perform an unbiased assessment on the role of transcriptional and post-
transcriptional control during hypothyroidism and lactation, known drivers of pituitary cell lineage plasticity.
The central hypothesis is that post transcriptional mechanisms are critical for the plasticity of
hormone producing cell lineages in the adult pituitary during adaptive responses to organismal
stress. We expect to fully inform the field about the molecular mechanisms underpinning Musashi target
mRNA-specific translational control. We will determine the relevance of Musashi-dependent control of human
pituitary mRNAs under physiological and pathological conditions and will elucidate in an unbiased manner the
molecular mechanisms controlling pituitary cell plasticity in response to changing hormonal demands.
Wherever possible, sex will be considered a variable. Findings from this study will positively impact
development of gender-specific therapeutic treatments for combined pituitary hormone deficiency and
pituitary tissue repair."
11054073,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Studies have identified a lower fatality risk in households that secure their firearms locked and unloaded when
compared to those where firearms are stored unlocked and loaded. Such findings are consistent across
populations, firearm types, and injury outcomes. Though clinician-provided storage counseling on firearms has
high acceptability with patients and is efficacious in enhancing secure storage practices , most pediatric
clinicians are not providing firearm safety counseling despite firearm related injury being the leading cause of
death among children and adolescents. Reported barriers to counseling include a lack of knowledge related to
storage strategies and counseling techniques. Thus, a screen-based virtual reality (VR) intervention grounded
in education and behavior change theory was developed to support mastery of firearm safety counseling
behaviors among pediatric clinicians. Within VR, a user can interact with graphical characters in a seemingly
realistic way to deliberately practice skills through receipt of immediate feedback. Dr. Real led the
development, usability testing, and preliminary efficacy testing of a human-facilitated version of the VR
intervention. Given the promising preliminary data, Dr. Real has developed a prototype for an automated
version of the intervention to promote scale and spread. Dr. Real’s long-term goal is to establish an
independent research career in the field of firearm injury and mortality prevention. The overall objective of the
application is to adapt the automated VR intervention and assess preliminary outcomes including acceptability,
feasibility, and usability to prepare for a future effectiveness-implementation trial. The rationale for the
proposed research is that an evaluation of an automated VR intervention will inform scalable strategies to train
clinicians to provide storage counseling, resulting in increased secure storage practices by patients and
caregivers, resulting in decreased access to firearms among children and adolescents, and ultimately lower
rates of firearm related injuries and deaths. To achieve our objective, we will accomplish these specific aims:
(1) adapt the automated VR intervention by conducting formative evaluations with stakeholders and (2) assess
implementation outcomes at multiple sites. To accomplish these aims and his long-term career goals, Dr. Real
requires training in (1) firearm injury prevention research, (2) community engagement, and (3) implementation
science. This training will occur through a combination of didactic, writing, and experiential research activities .
He will receive mentorship from leading researchers at University of Michigan and Harvard Medical School,
with Dr. Patrick Carter as the primary mentor. The scientific environment at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital
Medical Center strongly supports experienced investigators such as Dr. Real with an abundance of resources.
The expected outcomes of this work include foundational data to inform a technology-based intervention easily
accessible to clinicians to curb the leading cause of death among children and adolescents."

Young adult drinking is a major public health problem. Approximately 1 in 3 report frequent heavy episodic
drinking (4+/5+ drinks in two hours for females/males). Over 12.5% report consuming two to three times these
amounts (high intensity drinking). Young adults engaging in either of these “risky” drinking behaviors are at
high risk of experiencing alcohol consequences (e.g., alcohol-induced blackouts (AIBs), injury, sexual assault).
Although brief interventions have shown efficacy in reducing drinking, the findings have been mixed for
consequences. Concerns have been raised that the field has a limited understanding of the process by which
“accelerant-like” consequences (i.e., AIBs) are associated with additional and more harmful consequences
and the validity of self-reports of drinking on heavy drinking occasions. The overall goal of the proposed
research is to greatly extend the field by using objective transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) biosensors
to increase our understanding of why AIBs occur (en bloc and fragmentary) and their relationships with other
harmful consequences. Our pilot data showed risky drinking young adults experience AIBs on 1 out of every 3
drinking days. We also conducted a secondary analysis of ~800 student drinkers over 18 weekend evenings
which showed that on nights when AIBs occurred, students experienced ~3.5 more consequences than on
non-AIB nights. Closer observation revealed at least one of these additional consequences would be
considered severe (e.g., injury, sexual, legal). Evidence from our team and others indicate that at equivalent
levels of drinking, combining alcohol and cannabis, playing drinking games, pregaming, and rapid escalation in
blood alcohol concentration predict greater AIB risk. These findings suggest that the manner in which
individuals consume alcohol, in addition to the number of drinks, is important for the prediction of AIBs. To
focus on examining the manner in which individuals drink, our team has used objective transdermal alcohol
concentration (TAC) biosensors. TAC assesses alcohol use in near real time and records the manner in which
alcohol is being consumed through continuous measurement. Our research shows users have positive
experiences wearing TAC. Our data also provide evidence that TAC features predict consequences adjusting
for self-reported drink counts.Toward this end, the aims are as follows: Aim 1 will examine the associations
between TAC drinking features, AIBs, and other consequences; Aim 2 will conduct a theory-driven
examination of social and psychological influences, and biological risk related to TAC features, AIBs, and other
consequences. The scientific premise of our research is fully supported by the literature to be the first to
establish: 1) whether and to what extent TAC features can predict AIBs and other consequences; and 2) social
and psychological influences, and biological risk related to TAC features, AIBs, and other consequences. Our
approach is highly rigorous, capturing day-, burst-, and person-level prediction of AIBs and consequences."

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammatory arthritis
affecting children. It is the most common chronic pediatric rheumatic disease. Children with JIA are typically
treated with long-term immunosuppressive medications. Although there are many good treatments available to
treat JIA, disease flares are common, affecting approximately 40% of patients even after disease control is
achieved. Yet, the etiology of disease flares has not been well-studied. Pediatric rheumatologists commonly
blame viral infection as the causes of JIA flares, and although this is a reasonable assumption, there is little
evidence to support this claim. JIA shares common pathophysiology with adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA
studies have led to the mucosal origin hypothesis, which theorizes that immune responses against mucosal
organisms drives the development of autoantibodies in pre-clinical RA, prior to evidence of joint inflammation.
More recently, studies have linked viral upper respiratory infections (URIs) as a ‘second hit’ that leads to onset
of arthritis in RA. If URIs have been linked to arthritis in adults, it is highly plausible that URIs are associated with
JIA onset and flares in children, particularly since young children have far more frequent URIs compared to
adults. There is only one prospective study of viral URIs in patients with JIA, and the study found that in 20% of
patients who had disease worsening, there was a temporal association with a symptomatic infection. This
proposed study hypothesizes that children with JIA have increased susceptibility to viral URIs, prolonged viral
carriage, and prolonged dysbiosis of the nasopharyngeal microbiome following URIs. It also hypothesizes that
JIA disease flares are temporally associated with URIs, regardless of the severity of the URI symptoms. The
hypotheses will be tested by enrolling a cohort of 35 young children with JIA and 35 healthy siblings to serve as
controls. The children will undergo weekly nasal swabs for 26 weeks over the respiratory viral season
(November-April). Symptoms, hospitalizations and antibiotic use will be collected weekly using electronic
surveys. The study will also assess for incident symptomatic and asymptomatic respiratory viral infections using
an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing technique and quantify microbiome alpha and beta diversity and
composition by 16S rRNA sequencing. The study will also assess for associations between viral URI, microbiome
changes, and JIA disease activity with a self-reported JIA disease flare survey, also collected weekly.
The results of this study may provide guidance to children with JIA about risk for URIs, period of infectivity and
associations between viral infection and disease flare. Importantly, if the study identifies a relationship between
the nasopharyngeal virome and microbiome and how it affects JIA disease activity, it may lead to the
identification of novel pathways for JIA and RA treatments."

 The circadian clock is an endogenous ~24-hour oscillator that drives daily rhythms of biological
processes. In mammals, circadian clocks are found in the brain and peripheral tissues. Together, the
distributed clocks constitute the basic timing system regulating behavior, physiology, and metabolism.
 The mammalian circadian clock is built on a transcriptional negative feedback loop that generates
circadian rhythms at the molecular level. The transcription factor BMAL1 is at the heart of this feedback
loop, acting as the positive element activating circadian clock transcription. Long-standing evidence
suggests that peripheral clocks and brain clocks differ with respect to BMAL1. In the periphery, BMAL1
transcriptional action (and clock function) requires the heterodimeric partner CLOCK, whereas in the brain
either CLOCK or NPAS2, a protein related to CLOCK, suffices to sustain the role of BMAL1 in clock
function. Circadian clocks in the brain thus possess a redundancy not found in peripheral clocks.
 We recently developed procedures for purifying native BMAL1 activator complexes from bovine
cerebral cortex, making large-scale purification for biochemical and structural studies of brain circadian
clock complexes practical. We find that BMAL1 activator complexes from brain are exclusively ~750 kDa
in mass, much larger than a free heterodimer and similar to what we previously observed in the periphery.
The complexes can be purified into two populations, one including BMAL1 and CLOCK (as in the
periphery), the other BMAL1 and NPAS2 (not found in the periphery). Electron microscopy revealed the
complexes to be discreet particles of ~20 nm in diameter, consistent with the estimated mass.
 The composition of these complexes is unknown; as expected of activator complexes, they do not
appear to include circadian negative feedback proteins. Their mass is sufficient for roughly 10-12 proteins
of average size. The full molecular identity and structure of the circadian clock transcriptional activators
are thus not yet known, a fundamental gap in our understanding. The goal of this application is to analyze
the composition of the two BMAL1 complexes purified from brain and develop procedures for determining
their three-dimensional structures by cryo-electron microscopy. If successful, the project offers to deepen
our knowledge of circadian clock transcription, provide potential new drug targets for circadian
therapeutics, and reveal differences between brain and peripheral clocks.
 Advances in understanding the circadian clock are important for our knowledge of behavior and
physiology, as well as for human health and disease. Clock defects produce disrupted sleep-wake cycles,
metabolic syndrome, and increased cancer incidence and are linked to bipolar disorder. The proposed
investigation aims to provide fundamental insights into the biological timing system essential for health."
11057142,"Astrocyte border formation involving proliferative reactive changes in local astrocytes is a conserved feature of
many CNS disorders including neurotraumatic, neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neoplastic
diseases. Across disorders, astrocyte borders form against a non-neural niche compartment, containing
stromal and peripherally derived myeloid cells, whose cellular composition varies across disorders and stages
of disease. Despite targeted loss of function studies revealing the neuroprotective roles of astrocyte borders,
the context-specific functions of astrocyte borders at different non-neural niches are still poorly understood.
The development of new tools and techniques to dissect the complex biology at astrocyte borders in a
simplified, focal, and reproducible model system is needed to address important knowledge gaps. Injecting
biomaterials into mouse brain promotes spatiotemporally controlled astrocyte border formation and we see an
opportunity to use biomaterials to generate a new bioassay to study astrocyte borders. The main objective of
this project is to advance a new bioassay to stimulate and characterize astrocyte borders and use this
bioassay to profile several different functional states of astrocyte borders conferred by interactions with diverse
non-neural cell populations. Our overall hypothesis is that by locally injecting cellulose-based biomaterials with
different physiochemical properties into the mouse striatum we will stimulate distinct non-neural niches that will
confer temporal- and biomaterial-dependent changes in astrocyte states during the transition into astrocyte
borders which we can profile. In aim 1, we will optimize the bioassay to study astrocyte borders by combining
injectable, non-resorbable methyl cellulose hydrogels with viral vectors (AAVs) enabling astrocyte specific
expression of RiboTag. At 7, 14, 28, and 70 days after hydrogel injection into the mouse striatum, mRNA from
the formed astrocyte borders will be recovered by RiboTag immunoprecipitation and processed by RNA-Seq.
Cohorts of mice taken at the same timepoints will be processed by IHC to visualize changes in astrocyte
morphology, ribosome trafficking, and multicellular interactions. To validate capacity to detect altered astrocyte
border states we will disrupt astrocyte border formation by controlled release of molecular inhibitors. In aim 2,
we will evaluate astrocyte border states at non-neural niches with different immune cell compositions that will
be created by chemically modifying cellulose-based hydrogels to display non-fouling, immunosuppressive, or
immunostimulatory functional groups as well as through local delivery of small molecule immunoregulators
from hydrogels. Through this project, we will make important technical innovations to develop a new bioassay
that will allow us to identify conserved- and context-dependent mechanisms involved in astrocyte border
formation and function. This work will provide the foundations on which to explore therapeutic targeting of
astrocyte borders to direct CNS disorder outcomes and improve medical device biocompatibility in future work."
11057198,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Altered GABAergic interneurons have been documented following genetic and environmental perturbations in Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suggesting that GABAergic interneurons might be particularly susceptible and contribute to
ASD pathophysiology. We identified Caspr2, a neuronal protein to be a target of 3 monoclonal IgG derived from
mothers with anti-brain antibodies (Ab) with an ASD child, and found that ~40% of mothers with anti-brain Ab harbor
anti-Caspr2 IgG. Caspr2 expression is localized during development to proliferating progenitor cells of pyramidal
neurons in the ventricular zone and to the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) where somatostatin and parvalbumin
interneurons (PVI) arise. It is involved in stabilization of dendrites and synapses and is an ASD risk gene. Its brain
expression is similar between females and males throughout gestation. We have demonstrated that exposure in utero
to either human monoclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG or polyclonal anti-Caspr2 IgG results in male offspring with structural
and behavioral alterations. Female offspring show no such alterations. Here we focus on the immunization model in
which female mice are immunized with the extracellular domain of human Caspr2 and harbor endogenous polyclonal
anti-Caspr2 Abs throughout gestation. Male mice exposed in utero to anti-Caspr2 IgG (“Anti-Caspr2”) exhibit a specific
reduction in PVIs but not in number of other hippocampal interneurons such as somatostatin, calretinin and
cholecystokinin in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to adjuvant immunized control mice (“Control”). The
reduction in PVIs is evident at postnatal age P21 and is not accompanied by a reduction in total number of GABAergic
cells. The reduction in PVIs in Anti-Caspr2 male mice is not explained by a reduction in PV progenitor cells or altered
migration, as number of proliferating and apoptotic progenitor interneurons in the MGE and the number of migratory
MGE interneurons is similar between Control and Anti-Caspr2 male mice. Given the contribution of PVIs to gamma
oscillations, we implanted multi-electrodes in Anti-Caspr2 male mice, targeted to the striata oriens and pyramidale,
and calculated relative power of the gamma band. Anti-Caspr2 male mice exhibit a significant increase in mid and
high gamma oscillations. Taken together, the model permits a study of the impact of PVIs during development as they
pertain to ASD. Our hypothesis is that in utero exposure to anti-Caspr2 Abs has sex specific epigenetic effects on PVI
maturation, which contribute to network imbalance in male mice.
 We therefore propose to study:
1. Whether the reduction in PV expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is associated with epigenetic
 changes that disrupt the normal transcriptional profile of PVIs in male but not female Anti-Caspr2 mice.
2. When abnormal PVIs network patterns develop in Anti-Caspr2 mice and what are the functional consequence
 of disrupting PVI development using ex vivo hippocampal slices."

As the largest cortical recipient of direct olfactory bulb (OB) projections and a prominent part of the rodent brain, the
piriform cortex (PCx) is considered to be a central hub for the processing and coding of olfactory information. While
landmark studies have made significant progress towards deciphering PCx odor coding, there remains (in many cases) a
significant disconnect between our understanding of olfactory perception and the coding principles that underlie it. For
example, the PCx exhibits a massive over-representation of identity information that appears disproportional to the number
of glomerular inputs necessary to encode odor features or drive odor-guided behavior. The efficient coding hypothesis
predicts that in a low-noise situation (i.e., one with sparse receptor activation), the neuronal population should remove
redundancies in order to most efficiently encode the stimulus. In a high noise situation (i.e., one with significant non-target
receptor activation), the system should attempt to encode the stimulus in the most robust manner possible, by becoming
highly redundant. Thus far, the stimulus concentrations utilized to examine PCx neural activity are typically many orders of
magnitude above natural odorant concentrations - potentially signifying that these coding principles have been examined
primarily in high neural noise situations. The ability to examine PCx neural activity within sparse receptor activation
regimes will ultimately require knowledge about the limits of perceptual sensitivity and necessitate analyzing odor-evoked
responses at both single neuron and ensemble levels. Here, we propose a technically innovative approach that will refine
the current model of PCx odor coding. Specific Aim 1 will examine how the neural dynamics of individual and ensemble
PCx neurons encode odor identity across different concentration regimes by utilizing high density recording across eight
PCx locations, spanning a total A-P distance of 2.7mm. Specific Aim 2 will utilize the same electrophysiological approach
in conjunction with our robust behavioral measures of sensitivity to investigate how the coding principles identified in Aim
1 predict perceptual ability. Achieving these aims will offer a unique and unparalleled window into odor processing by
analyzing PCx neural activity at both local and mesoscale levels, across different concentration regimes, in a manner that
can be correlated to perception."

 RNA quality control pathways play essential roles in ridding cells of defective RNAs that
arise from RNA damage, misprocessing, or transcription of pseudogenes. Much has been
learned over the past decades about the quality control pathways that monitor the integrity of
protein-coding messenger (m)RNAs, such as the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.
Much less is known about those quality control pathways that monitor non-coding (nc)RNAs,
which make up ≈95% of the cell's RNA and are susceptible to the same types of damage as
mRNAs. The primary goal of this research is to uncover the mechanisms whereby ncRNA
quality control pathways distinguish normal from defective RNAs, how the defective RNAs are
targeted for degradation, and what are the consequence of failures in these pathways to cell
function and human health.
 To address these questions we will over the next five years focus on the quality control
of abundant human stable small ncRNAs that are critical to cell function, including small nuclear
(sn)RNAs of the spliceosome and 7SL RNA of the signal recognition particle. We will take
advantage of the fact that 1,000s of pseudogenes of these RNAs exist in the human genome,
many of which produce defective ncRNA variants that must be detected and degraded by
quality control pathways. The features of these defective ncRNAs that are identified by quality
control pathways and the factors involved in their degradation will be uncovered through
targeted and global assays monitoring effects of degradation factor depletion and ncRNA
mutagenesis on the stability of the ncRNA variants. We recently uncovered a central role for 3'
end-processing machineries in one such quality control pathway that targets defective snRNAs,
and will therefore additionally over the next five years pursue RNA targets and potential roles in
RNA quality control of 3' end processing factors, including factors that when defective cause
human neurodegenerative disorders.
 These efforts should uncover principles by which defective human small ncRNAs are
detected and degraded by quality control pathways, a mostly unexplored yet critical aspect of
gene expression. These efforts also have the potential to provide insights into defects in RNA
processing that lead to human disease such as neurodegenerative disorders."

The mission of The University of Chicago (UChicago) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to train the
next generation of clinician-scientists for impactful careers in the biomedical sciences. Impact is broadly
defined as: providing fundamental insights into disease and relevant biological mechanisms, leading or making
substantial contributions to translational efforts to identify better therapies and/or filling leadership roles that will
determine how limited resources can best be used to improve human health. Our overall objective is to train
outstanding and self-directed clinician scientists who can formulate and answer biologically and medically-
important questions. To ensure the greatest impact, our program must reflect the diversity of the U.S.
population in both who it trains and who it serves. To accomplish our mission and overall objective, we defined
15 specific and measurable objectives that stress the technical, operational and professional skills that support
science identity and self-efficacy and are critical for a successful career as an independent biomedical
investigator. Two unique features of the program enable our mission and provide an optimal training
environment for the development of clinician-scientists. First, we are our own graduate program, the
Interdisciplinary Scientist Training Program (ISTP). The ISTP allows integration of graduate and medical
school classes in MS1, development of tailored curricula for each trainee, coordination across training
transitions and uniform oversight and expectations during the graduate phase. Second, most trainees pursue a
1-4-3 progression of study rather than the traditional 2-4-2 progression. While trainees may pursue a 2-4-2, the
1-4-3 provides a continuous and in-depth graduate experience where trainees become well-trained scientists
who can propose and rigorously test hypotheses. The 1-4-3 also provides a seamless transition between the
preclinical and clinical phases which facilitates overall success in medical school. Multiple programmatic
features ensure that fundamental scientific and clinical knowledge are interwoven to foster the development of
impactful clinician-scientists. The UChicago MSTP enjoys sustained and substantial University financial
backing including generous direct investment and support of facilities that cultivate innovative science. We are
requesting 25 training slots to supplement University investments to support trainees for six of the typical eight
years they spend in the MSTP. This requested investment by the NIH would constitute only 13% of total
anticipated cost for our MSTP. We anticipate a program size of approximately 80 trainees and expect, based
on our track record, that our trainees will contribute significantly to the U.S. biomedical enterprise."

Current treatment strategies for Achilles tendinopathy seek to modulate the tendon mechanical environment to
promote healing and regeneration. However, a lack of fundamental understanding of tendinopathic
mechanobiology limits optimization of rehabilitation strategies and impedes development of targeted mechano-
therapeutics. This proposal will address these gaps using orthogonal experiments across human tendinopathy,
rat overuse, and mechanistic mouse models. The proposed studies will establish a framework to inform
mechanotherapeutic strategies and identify novel signaling targets. Tendinopathy, particularly caused by
overuse, often results in tissue microdamage. This microdamage, in turn, impairs transmission of tensile
mechanical signals through the tissue, resulting in under-loading of endogenous tendon cells. Our preliminary
data show that tendon cells exhibit a biphasic response to tendon de-tensioning. De-tensioning causes a
transient loss in cytoskeletal tension and mechanotransductive signaling, resulting in upregulation of matrix
degrading enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases. Subsequently the tendon cells attempt to re-tension the
matrix by cytoskeletal contraction and matrix re-organization. This biphasic response represents a novel
framework for understanding the development, progression, and translational intervention of tendinopathy. In
the proposed studies, we will 1) determine how tendinopathic disease impacts Achilles tensional homeostasis
across the spectrum of disease, 2) define the mechanotransductive mechanisms, and 3) determine how
rehabilitative loading restores Achilles tensional homeostasis for translational impact. Using our expertise in
tenogenesis and tendinopathy (Dyment) and mechanobiology (Dyment/Boerckel), this translational project will
provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanotransductive mechanisms that drive aberrant and
chronic matrix remodeling during Achilles tendinopathy, define mechano-response benchmarks in controlled
assays that may predict clinical patient outcome, and identify potent drug targets for the next generation of
tailored mechanotherapeutics to complement the current gold standards of physical therapy and surgery."
11076387,"SUMMARY
Gastric parietal cells (PCs) play a critical role in GI function by secreting acid for digestion and protection
against infection and by synthesizing growth factors that influence the development of other cell types including
zymogenic chief cells. Although there has been longstanding interest in defining PC biology and gastric acid
secretion dating back to the 1800s, PCs have been challenging to study. PC dysfunction, including acid
hypersecretion or hyposecretion, underlies a range of human diseases associated with a high socioeconomic
burden including chronic gastritis, drug-related peptic ulcer disease, Helicobacter pylori related peptic ulcer
disease, and cancer. For example, peptic ulcer disease affects more than 4 million people in the US each year
with 1 in 10 persons experiencing an ulcer at least once, and gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer
related deaths worldwide. Given the essential role for PCs in maintaining a healthy stomach, it is surprising
that a comprehensive understanding of the molecular programs that regulate and maintain normal PC
differentiation and function, and thereby PC health and overall gastric epithelial cell health, is incomplete. Our
finding that the transcription factor GATA4 binds to the regulatory regions—enhancers and promoters—of
81% of gene set defined as being uniquely expressed in PCs sheds light on the PC knowledge gap,
implicating GATA4 as a crucial principal regulator of PC biology. The goal of this proposal is to test the
central hypothesis that GATA4 is required to maintain homeostasis of the mature gastric epithelium by
directly controlling the gene expression program defining PC function. Studies in Aim 1 will define the
mechanistic contribution of GATA4 to PC function using a conditional mouse model to delete GATA4 in PCs
and a suite of morphological and molecular investigative tools. Studies in Aim 2, using a Gata4 conditional
knock-in model uniquely available in our lab to overexpress GATA4 in PCs in conjunction with gastric injury,
will provide evidence to determine the extent to which GATA4 loss is necessary for PC dysfunction and
downstream metaplasia. We will also examine the contribution of GATA4 promoter hypermethylation to PC
dysfunction and metaplasia. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will apply findings from the mouse to human PC biology
using human gastric organoids to determine the extent to which GATA4 function in PCs is evolutionarily
conserved. Overall, we expect our studies to elucidate GATA4-dependent molecular pathways essential to
maintain PC function and health and that, when disrupted, cause PC dysfunction and gastric disease.
Discoveries of fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms, in this case those underpinning normal gastric
epithelial cell homeostasis, can provide prerequisite knowledge to apply to future clinical applications for
gastric diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, metaplasia, and cancer."

Every year, ~40,000 women in the US who had been successfully treated for primary breast cancer
nonetheless have metastatic recurrence. Metastasis requires four key steps: 1) tumor cells leave the tumor; 2)
tumor cells enter a new tissue; 3) disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) re-initiate proliferation; and 4) an
inflammatory microenvironment is established to support the growing metastasis. Steps 1-2 often happen
before the cancer is diagnosed and are rarely amenable to intervention, but we may be able to target steps 3-4
to reduce the occurrence of metastasis. To accomplish this long-term goal, we must determine a) how the
quiescent DTCs re-initiate proliferation and b) how the metastasis-supporting inflammatory microenvironment
is established. Our research on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has provided novel insights into how
these processes can occur. NETs consist of meshes of genomic DNA with ~40 associated proteins, and they
are released by neutrophils to the extracellular space in response to infections and inflammation. In mouse
models, we found that lung inflammation, induced by tobacco smoke or bacterial lipopolysaccharide, triggered
quiescent DTCs to re-initiate proliferation, causing lethal metastases. Using intravital imaging, we found that
DTCs were surrounded by NETs after lung inflammation. We discovered that proteases on NETs cleave
laminin, a basement membrane protein. This cleavage generated a laminin epitope that activated integrin
receptors, triggering quiescent DTCs to proliferate. To interfere with this mechanism, we developed an
antibody against NET-cleaved laminin (ChiAb28). ChiAb28 prevented metastasis in over half of the mice and
reduced metastasis in the remaining mice. Thus, NET-associated proteases drive step 3 of the metastatic
process. In parallel, our new data show that other NET-associated proteins activate macrophages to secrete
interleukin (IL)-1β, which in turn induces more NETs and supports the metastases. This NET/macrophage
feedback loop may create an inflammatory microenvironment that supports the metastasis (step 4).
 Our data have led us to hypothesize that NETs trigger metastases from quiescent DTCs by a) cleaving
laminin to re-initiate proliferation and b) driving a feedback loop that causes local inflammation. How NETs
cleave laminin, however, is still unclear, and we will determine these mechanisms in Aim 1. How the feedback
loop between NETs and macrophages via IL-1β secretion maintain the growth of the metastasis will be
determined in Aim 2. Finally, we will combine our unique expertise in NET biology, the tumor
microenvironment, and intravital imaging to investigate combination treatments with ChiAb28 and either
chemotherapy or IL-1β blocking antibodies as new therapeutic approaches to prevent metastasis in Aim 3.
 This project will determine the mechanisms that are responsible for NETs' ability to drive the transition
from quiescent to proliferating DTCs and further to lethal metastases. New knowledge of how NETs promote
metastasis may ultimately allow the development of NET-targeting strategies to prevent metastasis."

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are metabolites produced by the fermentation of fibers by bacteria in the gut
and play an important role in the maintenance of health and disease prevention in a variety of disorders,
including metabolic, autoimmune, and neurological diseases. The sufficient production of SCFAs in the gut and
their efficient absorption by intestinal epithelial cells and transport into systemic circulation are important for
disease prevention. Although the effect of prebiotics and probiotics on the production of SCFAs in the gut has
been extensively studied, their effect on the absorption and transport of SCFAs has not been well studied.
Low-grade intestinal inflammation is one of the causes of reduction in the expression of SCFAs-transporter
genes and the transport of SCFAs into the systemic circulation. We found that the levels of intestinal
inflammation biomarker are increased in MS patients compared to healthy donors (HDs), and the levels of the
SCFA acetate are lower in the blood but higher in fecal samples in MS patients compared to HDs, suggesting
insufficient absorption and transport of SCFA acetate in MS patients. We hypothesize that MS-associated gut
dysbiosis may trigger and/or exacerbate the inflammation in the gut and subsequently reduce the expression of
SCFAs-transporter genes and their transport into the system circulation. To examine this hypothesis, germfree
mice will be transplanted with fecal samples collected from MS patients and HDs, and examined for the
expression of SCFA-transporters and tight junction proteins, intestinal permeability, and concentration of SCFAs
in fecal and blood samples. Further, we will examine the development of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, in the human microbiota-transplanted mice in Aim-1.
We found that the abundance of B. massiliensis was significantly associated with increased levels of acetate,
butyrate, and propionate in the blood. B. massiliensis is a newly isolated bacterium from healthy human fecal
samples, and its effect on health has not been explored yet. Of interest, the culture supernatant of B.
massiliensis and its outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) up-regulated the expression of SCFAs-transporter genes.
We also found that A. hallii, SCFA-producing bacterium, is reduced in the gut of MS patients and that intake of
high-fiber diets (HFD) can increase the colonization of SCFAs-producing bacteria. Therefore, we hypothesize that
treatment with A. hallii or HFD can increase the production of SCFAs in the gut and increased colonization of B.
massiliensis could promote the transport of SCFAs into the blood circulation. We will test this hypothesis in Aim-2.
In this study, we will elucidate a novel mechanism of how the gut microbiome impacts health and modulates
disease, and identify a synbiotic intervention with HFD and B. massiliensis as a beneficial treatment for
autoimmune diseases including MS."

Drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is listed as one of the 5 Urgent Threats in the US by the CDC and
one of 6 pathogens determined as high priority by WHO. Multi-drug resistant NG (MDR-NG) has emerged in
the US and globally and there is strong evidence that strains of MDR-NG can spread within dense community
networks of men who have sex with men. While urogenital NG infections typically dominate surveillance data
due to ease of sampling (urine, non-invasive vaginal swabs) and high frequency of exposure at these sites,
extra-genital sites of infection (i.e., throat, rectal) are critical to detect emerging strains of NG with reduced
antimicrobial susceptibility. During the COVID-19 pandemic, NG rates dramatically increased, with heightening
racial and ethnic disparities. To effectively disrupt NG transmission and increasing rates of resistance, we
need to improve our surveillance of emerging resistance and understanding of community spread. Whole
genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful epidemiologic tool for a range of pathogens. While WGS for
bacterial cultures is streamlined and performed readily by labs, applying this methodology to NG-an organism
for which cultures are not regularly used in clinical care-is challenging, leading to a significant gap in
knowledge of NG spread. Furthermore, public health surveillance for antimicrobial-resistant NG largely relies
on cultures for a narrowly defined population, limiting representativeness. Creating a pipeline to make WGS of
NG directly available from non-culture based urine and extragenital clinical specimens would improve
surveillance for emerging resistance and in future work, significantly alter the landscape of understanding NG
spread. Funds are requested to use WGS for non-culture based clinical urine and extragenital specimens to
enhance detection of emerging resistance in strains of NG. We anticipate that sequencing of routinely
collected clinical NG specimens, including those from extragenital sites, will allow for surveillance of
populations often excluded from traditional culture-based surveillance, thus enhancing our ability to detect NG
strains with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility. Our study will utilize NAAT-positive NG specimens from Cook
County Health-the county's safety-net healthcare network and its dedicated Sexual Health Clinic. The
proposal has two aims: (1) Establish workflows for rapid and inexpensive WGS of NG directly from urine,
throat, and rectal specimens collected as part of clinical care, and (2) Evaluate non-culture based molecular
surveillance as an approach to enhance detection of emerging strains of NG with reduced antimicrobial
susceptibility. Our findings will be broadly generalizable to healthcare centers across the US, most of whom
routinely employ NAAT testing as their first-line method for NG testing. Knowledge gained would inform the
merits of different strategies for enhanced NG surveillance, increase the timeliness of detection of emerging
variants of concern, and maximize reach to communities most at risk. Since NG is a high priority CDC and
WHO pathogen, our proposal has significant public health impact."

 In the absence of an effective preventive vaccine or a cure, HIV-1 continues to be a major global health
crisis. Having claimed 40.4 million lives so far with ongoing transmission in all countries globally, according to
the World Health Organization, with some countries reporting increasing trends in new infections when
previously on the decline. For the estimated 39.0 million people living with HIV at the end of 2022, highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) provides the best current hope for avoiding fatality due to the infection. While
HAART has substantially reduced morbidity and mortality, it is not curative due to the formation of a very stable
reservoir of latent virus in resting memory CD4+ T cells. The Duke Center for HIV Structural Biology (DCHSB)
brings together a diverse team of scientists to focus on structural studies of the HIV-1 Envelope (Env) protein
that provides new insights into dynamics of HIV-1 entry and fusion with the host membrane, the Env-initiated
immune activation of B cell receptors, and the role of anti-Env antibodies in blocking viral rebound.
 This multicomponent application for an Administrative Supplement for U54 AI170752, will accelerate
membrane protein technologies for HIV-1 Env studies, aimed at structural dissection of the mechanisms of
antibody interactions to the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), understanding HIV-1 coreceptor
tropism and elucidating the mechanism of a gp41 directed fusion inhibitor. The second component will add a
Direct Detector Camera to our existing Tundra microscope to enable routine high resolution cryo-EM data

This CFAR meeting supplement application requests funding to support the 2025 meeting of the Social and
Behavioral Sciences Research Network: SBSRN 2025. The meeting will be co-hosted by the Penn and UNC
CFARs and will partner with the Inter-CFAR Substance Use Research Committee and the National CFAR CAB
Coalition. SBSRN 2025 will target early stage investigators (ESI) whose work integrates social and behavioral
sciences in HIV prevention and treatment research. The meeting will be held in person to maximize opportunities
for networking with peers from other CFARs and ARCs, established investigators, and importantly, NIH program
officials. We have selected a venue in North Bethesda to increase opportunities for NIH staff to participate in
both the Mentoring Day and the Scientific Symposium. The overarching goal of the meeting is to engage and
energize early stage investigators working in HIV from CFARs and ARCs around the country by providing: 1)
updates and insights into the NIH research priorities and application and review processes; 2) opportunities to
present and receive feedback on emerging research concepts and applications being developed by participating
ESI; 3) meaningful interactions with NIH program officers, senior HIV investigators, and community leaders; and,
4) presentations on cutting edge science able to inform the HIV research agenda moving forward. Beginning in
2006, the SBSRN met annually through 2018 and again in 2022. Over this time, attendance averaged between
100 and 150 participants, and the meeting consistently received very positive evaluations, particularly among
the 259 ESI who participated as mentees. The SBSRN meeting has become a highly valued, shared resource
for CFARs around the country. It is uniquely focused on promoting transdisciplinary HIV research among
behavioral scientists from a variety of disciplines and places a high priority on personal interactions among
behavioral, clinical, and basic science investigators, NIH program officials, and ESI, particularly those from
under-represented racial and ethnic groups. The provisional theme of the proposed meeting is “The Role of
Behavioral and Social Scientists in Getting to Zero.” Funds will be used to cover the cost of the meeting venue
and travel for ESI and selected speakers."

11053848,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal is a supplement to R01 AI156534, “The role of IL-37 in human regulatory T cells,” designed to
enhance the training of Dr. Cameron Lloyd, PhD, who will be hired as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department
of Dermatology at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus. Understanding peripheral tolerance
and the maintenance of immune system homeostasis is vital in the control of human diseases. We have
previously demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 participates in immune tolerance by
generating semi-mature tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) in antigen-specific adaptive immune responses. IL-37
is one of eleven IL-1 family members and the only known member to be broadly anti-inflammatory. In our
recent project, we found IL-37 levels were elevated in multiple human immune cell types, specifically in
regulatory T (Treg) cells. Our further analysis revealed that human Treg cells express the highest IL-37 levels
among all T-cell subsets and that intracellular expression of IL-37 correlates with the expression of master
transcriptional regulator, FOXP3, in human Treg cells. Therefore, in the parent grant proposal (R01 AI156534),
we hypothesized that the expression of IL-37 upregulates and stabilizes FOXP3, thereby maintaining Treg
stability and highly suppressive function in human Treg cells, and we proposed 3 Aims to define transcriptional
and translational regulations of IL-37 expression in human Treg cells, molecular mechanisms of IL-37
expression in mediating FOXP3 expression and immune suppression, and the role of IL-37 in human Treg cell
heterogeneity. Here, supplemental funding is requested for Dr. Lloyd’s post-doc fellowship to propose an
extension to the parent project. The project utilizes human primary Treg cells and various disciplines from
immunology, cell biology, molecular biology, and protein chemistry, which would enhance the training of Dr.
Lloyd, who has been trained in molecular biology and microbiology. The University of Colorado has a strong
Immunology & Microbiology training record, and Dr. Lloyd will have a strong mentor team. Since our proposal
uses human T cells, the results could be easily translated into clinical medicine and patient care. The findings
will have an immense translational impact on many human diseases, such as autoimmunity and
transplantation."

Latinx adolescents from mixed-status families (where one or both parents are undocumented) comprise the
ethnic-racial group with the highest rates of depressive symptoms, which, if left untreated, can have life-long
deleterious impacts to their health. These youth also face additional barriers for care due to individual and
cultural stigma about mental health, difficulty discussing their mental health needs with caregivers or other
adults, as well as low mental health literacy and low access to mental health treatment. Research is necessary
to develop appropriate interventions tailored to the specific needs of Latinx adolescents, focusing on the
sociocultural and health care factors that impact their mental health. This career development K01 award will
address this gap in research while providing the candidate with the opportunity to fulfill the following goals: 1)
develop broad expertise in intervention development, 2) gain skills in intervention testing, refinement, and
evaluation, 3) enhance her knowledge of community-based participatory research (CBPR), and 4) acquire
skills in translation of research with immigrant populations. The proposed rigorous training and mentoring plan
includes coursework and workshops on health communications, implementation science, the design, conduct
and analysis of clinical trials, and advanced statistical analysis at the University of Michigan’s top-ranked
Schools of Social Work, Public Health, and Medicine. It also includes experiential learning through presenting
at national conferences, manuscripts, and grant submissions, as well as mentoring from experts in mental
health intervention development, Latinx adolescents’ mental health, implementation science, CBPR methods,
motivational interviewing, and community health workers. This training and mentoring will prepare the
candidate for her long-term career goals of developing efficacious, culturally grounded, and community-based
interventions to improve the mental health of Latinx adolescents. These training goals are rooted in a CBPR
framework and specific to working with Latinx immigrant communities through which the candidate aims to: 1)
Explore facilitators and barriers to adolescents’ (a) discussion of mental health needs with caregivers or other
adults and (b) use of mental health services expressed by both youth and their caregivers; 2) Develop a
culturally tailored, motivational interviewing-based intervention for Latinx adolescents from mixed-status
families aimed at (a) increasing youth discussions of their mental health needs with caregivers or other adults,
(b) reducing stigma of mental health treatment, (c) increasing their mental health literacy, and (d) increasing
mental health treatment engagement; 3) pilot and evaluate this intervention with 32 Latinx teens from mixed-
status families to determine its feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and potential impact on key outcomes. Through
these experiences and the guidance of her expert mentoring team, the candidate will gain the skills to support
her long-term career goal of becoming an independent intervention researcher."
11057350,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and
identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art
ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular
disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according
to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is
known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital
equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent
measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements.
There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in
particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of
information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective
monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value
in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring
exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to
develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors,
and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with
several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which
correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature
and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s
movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning
techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements
to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a
hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have
on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff-
based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure."
11054039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are indicated for first-line treatment of many conditions ranging
from pain to heart disease, but therapeutic use of the entire medication class can be precluded by reported
allergy. While NSAIDs represent the second most commonly reported class of drug allergies, it is estimated
that <20% of reported NSAID-induced reactions are consistent with allergic hypersensitivity (eg, urticaria,
angioedema, anaphylaxis), with the rest representing non-allergic side effects or intolerances (eg,
gastrointestinal upset, bleeding, nephrotoxicity). Allergy over-reporting and lack of reaction clarification can
lead to unnecessary drug avoidance, and increased use of second line, more costly, and less effective
alternative medications, with resultant downstream adverse effects on patient outcomes. The primary objective
of this proposal is to determine the impact of reported NSAID allergies on prescribing patterns and clinical
outcomes in distinct populations and to define predictors for true NSAID-induced allergic hypersensitivity. The
proposed study has three Aims: (1) to assess the impact of reported NSAID allergy on postoperative opioid
prescribing and sustained opioid use in a large electronic health record-derived cohort of patients undergoing
common surgical procedures; (2) to evaluate differences in aspirin administration and adverse cardiovascular
outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes with and without reported NSAID allergy; (3) to use a
well-defined cohort of subjects who have undergone allergist-observed NSAID drug challenge to determine
patient- and drug-specific risk factors for NSAID-induced hypersensitivity. Dr. Li’s research plan will be
supported by coursework and training in clinical and epidemiological study design, advanced biostatistical
methods for research with large datasets, informatics, patient recruitment, and drug-challenge protocols, and
the exceptional scientific environment at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She will receive mentorship from
Dr. Tanya Laidlaw, an allergy specialist and expert in aspirin- and NSAID-induced hypersensitivity, and Dr.
Karen Costenbader, a rheumatologist with extensive experience in investigating risk factors for disease and
long-term outcomes in affected patients using large national cohorts and datasets. Dr. Li will obtain additional
scientific input and career guidance from a team of three scientific advisors, including Drs. Joshua Boyce,
Elena Losina, and Kimberly Blumenthal, who have committed their time, resources and expertise to facilitate
her professional development and research goals. This K23 proposal is well-aligned with NIH initiatives to
reduce unnecessary opioid prescribing and NIAID support of drug allergy research, and will position the
candidate to submit an R01 application during the award period and to establish herself as an independent
patient-oriented investigator with a focus on improving the care and health of patients with drug allergies."

 Neurotech Harbor's (NTH) Resource Core (RC) will accelerate and improve the chance of success of funded
subprojects by working with all the other Cores in identifying, soliciting, evaluating, and managing Resources to
produce a human-grade prototype. We will implement a 6-step process for each subproject that will move forward
to NIH: (i) The Deep-Dive panel in the Evaluation Core (EC) will identify required resources and provide a list to
the RC. (ii) The RC will identify a list of targeted providers within the Resource Network and give this list to the
Outreach Core (OC). (iii) The OC will generate solicitations for each required resource and send these to the
targeted providers, nationwide providers, and other BP hubs to share with their resource networks. The
solicitations will encourage minority-owned and/or employed businesses to apply. (iv) Providers will submit their
bids to the EC, who will select the most appropriate resource providers for the proposal package. (v)The proposal
package, which includes the subproject proposal and proposal for the resource subaward, will be sent to the NIH
by the Administrative Core. (vi) Funded Subprojects will be managed by the Innovator Core (IC) and the
contracted resources will be managed by the RC.
 The Proposal Package submitted to NIH will identify the Resources and funding needed in conjunction with
the Innovators' projects. Once funded, the RC will be responsible for managing the performance and deliverables
for the Resources. Using the milestones, deliverables, and timelines identified in the Proposal Package and
industry-standard project management tools, the RC will create a formal plan to manage and document the
progress of each subaward and ensure success.
 For this process to be successful, and to match all subprojects with the resources that they require, the RC
must continue to grow its Resource Network and ensure proper management of the engagements between
contracted providers and subproject teams. The RC will accomplish this through the following aims: (Aim 1) To
manage Resource Subawards and ensure successful delivery of resources and services to Innovator subproject
teams. (Aim 2) To develop and expand the Resource Network such that providers with diverse services and
facilities can be readily targeted for required subprojects. (Aim 3) To expand the Resource Network such that
women- or URM-owned providers are encouraged to participate.
 To ensure that solicitations for services will be answered in a timely manner consistent with the accelerated
review cycle expected from BP Hubs, the RC will have prequalified Resource providers, and created the support
documents allowing evaluation of resource subaward proposals by the EC. These documents will help providers
turn our solicitations around quickly. Finally, we will work with our (OC) partners to reach women- and URM-
owned and/or employed resource providers and encourage them to participate."

Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is associated with neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative stress, leading to brain injury, function disability and development of Alzheimer’s disease-like
pathology and dementia. To fight against I/R induced pathological cascades, numerous neuroprotective
strategies and reagents have been identified and studied. However, translation of these neuroprotective
strategies and reagents to clinical trials has been unsuccessful, and to date, the tissue plasminogen activator
remains to be the only FDA approved drug for treating ischemic stroke. Thus, it is obligatory to identify and
validate additional therapeutic targets and reagents for I/R-caused brain disorder. The objective of this project
is to validate a novel therapeutic target, FOXO4, as previous data have shown that FOXO4 promotes early
tissue inflammation, and downregulation of FOXO4 is associated with reduced cell death and increased
neovasculature in ischemic peripheral tissues. Importantly, our pilot data have shown that knockout (KO) of
FOXO4 gene dramatically attenuates I/R-caused brain injury and alters numerous genes linked to AD in an
ischemic stroke mouse model. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that selective inhibition of
FOXO4 activity is protective against ischemic stroke-caused brain injury and AD-like pathology. To test the
hypothesis, we will (1) determine the role of FOXO4 in ischemic stroke-induced brain injury using genetically
modified mice, (2) study the role of identified FOXO4 inhibitors in treating ischemic stroke-caused brain injury,
and (3) understand how loss of FOXO4 confers neuroprotection following ischemic stroke."
11058586,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although T cell mediated immune responses are critical for the success of immunotherapy, those T cells
associated with malignant lesions are typically dysfunctional and fail to control tumor growth. Treatment with
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that are isolated, activated, and expanded ex vivo has proven very effective
in some patient populations of melanoma. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond,
presumably due to one of a number of host immune factors. Current understanding of TIL mechanism of action
suggests that both an early robust expansion of tumor-specific effector T cells and transfer of less differentiated
cells with long-term survival capacity are key to a successful therapy. Evidence for the former includes the need
for high dose exogenous IL-2 at the time of TIL infusion, the correlation of response with a high frequency of
effector T cells, and the majority of tumor killing occurring very early after the initiation of therapy. Evidence for
the latter is found in many pre-clinical experiments as well as clinical observations where the presence of TILs
from the central memory subset in the infusion product correlates with tumor regression. Our overall goal is to
improve TIL therapeutic efficacy through the generation of TIL products with both the transient ability to effectively
immediately kill tumor cells as well as the long-term ability to persist and maintain durable anti-tumor responses.
To address these challenges we have developed robust methods to reprogram TILs with mRNA-mediated gene
therapy. The use of our mRNA approach has the advantages of increased safety, high efficiency, rapid
production, tightly controlled expression levels and simultaneous multi-factor reprogramming. In preliminary
work we have developed a system that increases mRNA lifespan by an order of magnitude. Our single cell
analysis of patient TILs pre- and post-expansion has identified two specific pathways deficient in the expanded
TIL product that likely contribute to their poor immediate efficacy and absence of memory fate. Both of these
will be augmented by TIL mRNA reprogramming. In Aim 1 we will develop a method to enhance post-expansion
TIL survival, while in Aim 2 we will improve the production of central memory TILs. We will evaluate the effect
of these improvements in TIL production using paired tumor/TIL sets derived from the melanomas from multiple
patients by studying tumor-mediated TIL activation and tumor lysis in vitro and in pre-clinical humanized mouse
models using single cell analysis and advanced spatial transcriptomics. This application addresses the need to
improve response rates to adoptive cell immunotherapies for melanoma and is designed to be translatable to
clinical trials in the near future."
11058728,"ABSTRACT
Management of pain arising from orthopedic fractures remains a challenge as common analgesic medications
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opiates either interfere with healing or possess
unwanted side effects such as dependence. Given the prevalence of pain associated with orthopedic surgeries
and bone fractures, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic strategies that can mitigate pain while
promoting fracture healing. This motivated us to study the potential use of adenosine (ADO) as a therapeutic
agent for managing fracture pain. ADO is a naturally occurring small molecule that is released upon injury and
elicits analgesic effects in peripheral and central nerves. We and others have shown that extracellular ADO is
an effective osteoanabolic agent promoting bone formation and fracture healing. The osteoanabolic function of
ADO along with the analgesic function makes it an ideal molecule to treat fracture pain. The overarching goal of
the proposal is to assess the use of ADO for the management of pain in fracture injuries by advancing the
fundamental understanding of how ADO mitigates fracture pain and developing new clinically viable therapeutic
strategies. Towards this, Aim 1 of the proposal will develop and characterize an injectable biomaterial for local
delivery of ADO to the fracture site, and determine the dose-dependent effect on fracture healing. To determine
whether biomaterial-assisted local delivery of ADO provides analgesic effects following fracture injury, studies in
Aim 2 will perform behavioral tests for pain, tissue analyses, in vitro analyses by developing DRG-on-Chip
platforms, and RNA sequencing. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that ADO-mediated fracture pain mitigation
involves A1 receptors (A1Rs) by using animals with conditional knockout of A1R in sensory neurons, and
elucidates its regulation of ion channels. Completion of this proposal will establish a new therapeutic molecule
for the care of fracture trauma, and potentially change how bone injuries are treated. The broad impact of our
studies using localized delivery of ADO could be extended to the management of various types of acute and
chronic pain that originate in the peripheral or central nervous system."

In this proposal, we will define the effects of epigenetic dysregulation via Stag2 loss on three-dimensional
chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. We will define key lineage-specific chromatin features and
validate their hierarchy in differentiation in contrast to stem cell self-renewal. In Aim 1, we will perform low-input
Hi-ChIP assay on Ctcf (loop/TAD-boundary), Rad21 (pan-cohesin loop), ChIP assay for H3K27Ac (enhancer)
and RNA-seq (gene expression) on phenotypically defined mouse and human stem and progenitors to define
population-specific looping events. Using our novel ‘on-off-on’ dual recombinase (Stag2GL) allele, we will first
determine if the restoration of Stag2 can reverse the effects on self-renewal/differentiation and define chromatin
loops 1) perturbed during Stag2 loss and 2) restored after Stag2 reversion. Locus-specific functional assays will
determine the key events required for self-renewal through in vitro studies to phenocopy in ‘Stag2-on' or prevent
reversion in ‘Stag2-off’. In Aim 2, using our low cell input Hi-C and Hi-ChIP techniques to assess chromatin loops
alterations identified in our fully penetrant Stag2/Npm1c and Stag2/Flt3 co-mutant AML models in combination
with the Stag2GL allele. Using a multi-omics approach, we will define the chromatin landscape of Flt3 and Npm1
with and without the antecedent Stag2 mutation. We have created a well-annotated MDS and AML patient
biorepository, as well as a biorepository of healthy bone marrow from hip arthroplasty patients. Using these
primary patient samples, we will map chromatin loops and transcriptional output in stem and progenitor
populations and intersect lineage-specific interactions in human and mouse. Functional validation of chromatin
loops lost or gained in the co-mutant models will be assessed in vitro, prioritizing loci identified in primary AML
patient samples. These models will constitute the system to assess the effects of Stag2 loss on therapeutic
response to standard chemotherapeutic regimens ad well as to emerging targeted therapies such as Menin
inhibition in Npm1c-mutant AML (DSP5536) and FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-ITD mutant AML (gilteritinib). Finally,
Stag2 reversion in this system will definitively determine whether Stag2 is required for the maintenance of AML,

 A fundamental question in developmental biology is how migratory cells initiate migration, move in a
directed fashion towards their target, terminate migration and differentiate. Neural crest cells (NCCs) are an
excellent example of these developmental processes, initially forming at the neural plate border/dorsal neural
tube, undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and migrating before differentiating. This represents
an important problem, because defects in neural crest development underlie many human congenital birth
defects including Treacher-Collins syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and Hirschsprungs disease. We have
determined that NCCs extend cell projections that are enriched in specific RNAs. From these data, we
hypothesize that localization of specific migratory mRNAs to NCC protrusions by zipcodes are
required for directed migration. The rationale for the proposed studies is that an in-depth understanding of
the cellular mechanisms of normal NCC migration will provide insights into the etiology of both neural crest-
associated birth defects, including numerous syndromes, and cancer cell metastasis. We will test this
hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that specific mRNAs are enriched in NCC
protrusions and are required for NCC migratory behavior. In Aim 1, we will determine the transcriptome
and proteome of NCC projections and test their function. 2) Test the hypothesis that zipcode sequences in
NCC protrusion localized mRNAs are required for localization and NCC migration. In Aim 2, we will
examine the localization and function of UTR regulatory sequences. Together, these studies will reveal the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which specific RNAs and proteins enriched in NCC projections promote
NCC migration. The results of this proposal have the potential to reveal important new insights into NCC
migration in normal development and disease and will provide a foundation for the design of therapeutic
strategies for neural crest associated birth defects."

Chronic pain conditions place significant burdens on patients, their families, and society by reducing quality of
life and creating enormous financial consequences that total more than 630 billion USD annually for the United
States of America alone. Neuropathic pain is a debilitating type of chronic pain that arises from a lesion or disease
affecting the somatosensory system. Neuropathic pain affects 7-8% of the general population yet is poorly
responsive to analgesic drugs, including opioids, thus, alternative therapeutics for treatment are desperately
needed. However, the underlying mechanisms of the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain are
poorly understood. It is hypothesized that neuropathic pain results from a loss of spinal cord dorsal horn inhibition
and/or a gain in dorsal horn excitation that allows the propagation of low threshold innocuous inputs to be
perceived as painful. Exactly how nerve injury disrupts this balance to generate a net pronociceptive tone,
however, remains unclear. Specific Aim 1 describes promising preliminary data within our laboratory that
implicates glutamatergic dorsal horn interneurons expressing the neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor in both the
development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. First, selective ablation of neuropeptide Y1 receptor-
expressing interneurons (Y1-INs) with intrathecal NPY-saporin reduced the development of behavioral signs of
neuropathic pain. Second, intrathecal pharmacology and intraspinal chemogenetic techniques indicate that Y1-
INs are both necessary and sufficient for the behavioral manifestations of neuropathic pain. Lastly, both single
cell RNA-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization data indicate that Y1-INs segregate into three distinct
dorsal horn interneuron subpopulations. Together, these observations form the premise for my central
hypothesis that nerve injury increases the excitability of Y1-INs, and this makes one or more subpopulations of
Y1-INs necessary for the behavioral symptoms of neuropathic pain. Specific Aim 2 will explore this hypothesis
via intraspinal pharmacology, behavioral testing, in vivo wireless optogenetics, intersectional Cre-lox
transgenics, and patch clamp electrophysiology. Together these methods will test which Y1-IN subpopulation(s)
is/are necessary for the behavioral signs of neuropathic pain. Further, these methods will assess changes in pre-
or postsynaptic excitatory and inhibitory activity to Y1-INs following nerve injury to uncover mechanistic changes
in the circuit that might lead to the development of neuropathic pain. Specific Aim 3 details a plan to identify
and pursue a neuroscience focused postdoctoral fellowship following the completion of the dissertation work
described in Specific Aim 2. The overarching goals of this study are to increase our understanding of how nerve
injury increases the excitability of Y1-IN subpopulations, and provide rationale for targeting spinal Y1-INs as a
novel approach to treat neuropathic pain."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. It is submitted as a supplement to our parent R01CA252713 project, entitled “Canine MHC-I
genotyping and tumor specific neoantigen determination”.
This supplement project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI), specifically a recently emerged large language
model, to identify human and canine major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) alleles that are peptide-
presentation equivalents and then to transfer the >700,000 immunopeptidome data of the human to the
corresponding dog MHC-I alleles. To achieve this, we will expand our collaboration to include Dr. Dajiang Zhu,
a leading scientist in applying AI in biomedical research, to perform supplemental studies as follows. 1) We
will use advanced statistical models to group the ~170 human MHC-I alleles with immunopeptidome data into
supertypes based on their peptide-binding specificity. 2) We will train a local Llama, a cutting-edge open-
source large language AI model from Meta, to discover an MHC-I pseudosequence that can distinguish these
supertypes. 3) We will use the MHC-I pseudosequence to identify equivalent human and canine alleles, and
transfer human immunopeptidome dataset to each corresponding canine allele. 4) We will validate our models
by using our newly established mass spectrometry protocol to characterize the immunopeptidome of chosen
canine alleles.
This proposed supplement study will significantly enhance Aims 2a and 2b of the parent R01, by increasing
experimentally characterized canine alleles from 30 to up to 200 (Aim 2a) and increasing allele-specific antigen
model building from 30 to up to 200 (Aim 2b), accelerating canine tumor specific neoantigen discovery.
Importantly, our study will provide a powerful and innovative strategy for many other mammalian models with
little empiric immunopeptidome data to effectively borrow the human data, potentially saving millions of dollars,
and enhancing their translational values, the goal of the OMF."

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) of the Early Phase Pain Investigation Clinical Network (EPPIC-Net) will be
the data and biospecimen manager for pain research within the HEAL Partnership. As such, it will host, manage,
standardize, curate, and provide a sharing platform for data and biospecimens for HEAL initiatives, such as the
Acute to Chronic Pain Signature initiative and the BACPAC, in addition to EPPIC-Net studies. The DCC will
develop and maintain a databank for depositing pre-clinical, clinical, neuroimaging, microbiome, genomics, and
other omics biomarker data, will link these data with a repository for biological samples, and will create a platform
for teams to work together to analyze and interpret data. Further, the DCC will provide leadership in the statistical
design and analysis of EPPIC-Net studies, and will deploy advanced systems and processes for data collection,
management, quality assurance, and reporting. The DCC will create, sustain, and continually advance a robust
organization for the rapid design, implementation, and performance of high-quality rigorous Phase II clinical trials
to test promising therapeutics for pain. The proposed DCC brings together experts from statistics, clinical trials
design and simulation, data management, neuroimaging, bioinformatics, genomics, and radiology, and
leverages decades of experience instituting and running large data sharing consortia and data coordinating
centers. Our aims are to further the goals of EPPIC-Net and the HEAL initiative through: 1) Integration of the
DCC within the EPPIC-Net structure and facilitation of the alliance with HEAL partners; 2) Provision of
biostatistical expertise, support, and leadership to EPPIC-Net studies; 3) Provision of legacy and de novo secure
data storage and comprehensive data management for EPPIC-Net studies; 4) Institution of a pain-related
expandable biospecimen repository; and 5) Establishment of the EPPICNet DataExchange and
BiospecimenExchange to foster development of non-addictive treatments for pain. The DCC will be structured
around four cores:1) an Administrative Core; 2) a Statistics Core; 3) a Data Core; and 4) a Biospecimen Core.
This DCC will work with the EPPIC-Net Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and with the Specialized Clinical
Centers (SCC, a hub and its spokes/clinics) to educate clinicians and staff in good clinical trial practices for
reproducibility of research, and to train them in the data management system and procedures employed in the
network. The DCC will provide sites with user-friendly dashboards to monitor their own performance and will
promote collegial and supportive relationships with sites’ personnel to cultivate rigorous and enthusiastic
engagement in the conduct of the studies. The DCC will use state-of-the-art concepts and techniques in the
acquisition, transfer, storing, management, standardization, linking and curation of the clinical and biomarker
data to launch and maintain the EPPIC Exchange encompassing the DataExchange, and the
BiospecimenExchange. The EPPIC Exchange represents the final product delivered by the DCC–a resource
with capability for continual growth, that will be shared by the pain research community."

At the cornerstone of human bipedal locomotion are the pelvis and knee, two hind limb skeletal structures for
which we know little about their respective development in humans. Indeed, these structures have complex 3-D
morphologies whose initial patterns arise during the chondrogenic anlagen stage, when coordinated cellular
differentiation and proliferation establish various tissue types and the spatial relationships between different
structural components (e.g., between the knee’s distal femoral condyles and proximal tibial platform, or between
the pelvis’ ilium, pubis, ischium, and acetabular subdomains). Yet, for developing human skeletal structures, we
understand little about these cellular events and their relationships to tissue morphology and function. Moreover,
while one can envision that these events are mediated by a pleiotropic or common ‘skeletal growth’ gene set
and accompanied regulatory apparatus, how this tool kit is used in developing humans to build each structure,
remains a mystery. As biomedicine move towards regenerative therapies for joint tissues and mechanistic
investigations into developmental disorders of the skeleton, it is crucially important to gain a better understanding
of how cells of the skeleton and joints acquire their functional roles, and it is both timely and critical to establish
this at single cell and spatial resolutions. To date, large functional genomics-based consortia, such as an
ENCODE or the ROADMAP EPIGENOMICS PROJECT, have not focused on the skeleton due to logistical
issues in extracting cartilage cells from developing skeletal elements composed of hard extracellular matrix.
However, recent advances on this front by the grant investigators have allowed them to isolate and study
individual cartilage cells from developing human skeletons. The focus of this proposal, therefore, is to more
deeply investigate how the human knee, pelvis, and hind limb in general form in utero, at the level of individual
cells and in understanding how changes in their biology and behavior drive the respective development of each
hind limb structure. This will be accomplished via two main aims, one focused on the use of spatial
transcriptomics to examine expression dynamics histologically (Aim 1), and another on the use of a single cell
(sc) multiomics approach (Aim 2), consisting of scRNA-sequencing (to detect genes) and scATAC-sequencing
(to detect regulatory regions) on the same cell. By simultaneously profiling gene expression and regulatory
element availability at the individual cell level from many cells of these developing human structures, and
spatially, the necessary resolution will be achieved to define small but important nuances in the genetic programs
that govern anatomical-site-specific cartilage cell biology and how it links to hind limb morphology. Use of these
protocols developed by the grant’s Team will help ensure that an extraordinary resource is provided to the
musculoskeletal biology community, and that crucial information needed to develop novel pharmaceutical and
regenerative medicine-based therapeutics is made public."

Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of preventable death after a traumatic injury, and accounts for 91% of
military and 35% of civilian fatalities after trauma. Injuries to non-compressible intracavity regions, such as the
torso and abdomen, are a major clinical challenge due to a lack of appropriate interventions, and represent 30-
40% of early fatalities. To address this problem, endovascular hemorrhage control (EHC) devices and minimally
invasive techniques such as Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta (REBOA) have been
increasingly adopted. REBOA involves full inflation of a balloon catheter in the aorta, which restricts blood flow
distal to the occlusion and consequently minimizes bleeding. While REBOA is effective at restoring proximal
perfusion, the reductions in blood flow can result in ischemia-reperfusion injuries that increase the risk of
subsequent renal failure. As such, there is a pressing need to identify optimal occlusion size, timing, and duration
of REBOA deployment. To date, these important knowledge gaps are hindered by expensive and time intensive
large animal models that slow the pace of innovation. To address this major gap, we propose to develop and
validate a novel multi-scale computational model that will allow us to simulate the in vivo physiologic response
to hemorrhagic shock. Using a 3D-0D closed loop approach of the cardiovascular system, we will be able to
simulate the critical feedback loops and biologic response functions to render a physiologically relevant model.
These methods have been previously used to inform the design of cardiovascular stents and inferior vena cava
filters, but none to our knowledge have been exploited for the evaluation of REBOA or any other EHC device.
Our central hypothesis is that computational modeling of blood flow within the aorta and systemic vascular
network will generate accurate and robust values for pressure, flow and shear rates within  5% error, closely
mimicking in vivo behavior. The objective is to use this computational framework to: 1) quantify the local and
systemic hemodynamics (i.e., pressure, flow rate, shear stress, oxygen transport, etc.) during phases of active
hemorrhage, aortic occlusion with REBOA, and resuscitation, 2) identify vascular regions that are vulnerable to
ischemic damage as a result of the altered hemodynamics, 3) predict key physiologic responses related to
vascular compliance, oxygen delivery and renal autoregulation during hemorrhage and aortic occlusion, and 4)
determine optimal aortic occlusion size and duration of partial vs. full occlusion strategies to prevent ischemia-
reperfusion injuries and renal failure. Successful development and validation of this in silico model will greatly
contribute to the preclinical testing and optimization of EHC devices, minimizing the need for large animal studies
and also open doors for the study of other transient hemodynamic conditions within the cardiovascular system."

 The two aims of NeuroTech Harbor are: (AIM 1) to accelerate early development of the most promising
neuromedical solutions, and (AIM 2) to increase the number of women & URM innovators through outreach and
education, and to improve equity and accessibility of neuromedical solutions. NeuroTech Harbor (NTH), led by
Johns Hopkins and Howard Universities, will accelerate the development of highly promising solutions to improve
neurological health for all. Solutions for all means also for the underserved, often synonymous with minority
groups. Diverse innovators should sit at the table on day one, but very few minority entrepreneurs exist. To
address these inequities, we will build NTH with an Equitech philosophy, which is the belief that diversity of
teams, leadership, and perspectives is a force multiplier to fuel innovation, producing solutions accessible to all
communities. Hopkins & Howard are uniquely positioned to realize this vision. Hopkins brings a foundation of
researchers, prestigious research centers, and programs and has a translation track record ($3B invested in
start-ups in the last 7 years). Howard complements this with a large pipeline of aspiring under-represented
minority (URM) innovators both within and outside the Howard community. Howard has nurtured this community
with early-stage mentorship, a successful incubator program, and recently received a $17M grant to create a
Center for Entrepreneurship aimed at building resources and support for Black business owners across the
country.
 NTH will solicit proposals from innovators nationwide addressing pressing problems. Although the areas
supported will be broad, covering all participating NIH Institutes and Centers, the expertise of NTH will be
inclusive but focusing on Neuroprosthesis (cortical, spinal, peripheral, vision, and auditory), Brain Machine
Interface, Neuro Sensors and Devices, Neuro Informatics, Neuromodulation, and Mental Health. For funded
projects, resources will be provided, and a dream team of specialists will offer mentorship and tools to guide
successful translation to first-in-human prototype. Specialists will be drawn from a diverse Steering Committee,
Advisory Board, and Consultant Network, composed of highly regarded clinicians, scientists, technologists,
commercialization experts, and patient advocates. To expand diversity amongst innovators, NTH has formed
strategic Outreach Partnerships with access to Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving
Institutions across the nation. We have created an NTH Institute, a center for innovator leadership development
to educate innovators in business development, translation and project management. Importantly, our needs
assessments will be guided by the principles of equity and accessibility for all communities and will include the
input of underserved stakeholders. Our 5-year goals are to (i) solicit over 500 applications and launch 45 projects,
where at least 15 have 1 woman or URM innovator on the team, and (ii) blaze a trail to alleviate suffering from
neurological conditions for all, including the underserved...the Equitech way."

After birth, newborns are exposed to a wide array of environmental microbes, which rapidly colonize the infant
gastrointestinal tract and then gradually increase in diversity during the first years of the child’s life. Interestingly,
reduced diversity of the resident microbiota can be used to predict Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) onset in genetically
susceptible children, suggesting that early life microbiota diversity is critical in preventing diabetes. Concurrent
with initial colonization and diversification of the microbiota, insulin-producing β-cells undergo essential postnatal
developmental processes. My graduate work showed that zebrafish require intestinal bacteria for post-hatching
proliferation of β-cells. In my postdoc I have gone on to show that germ-free mice also have significant deficits
in β-cell mass and insulin production capacity which can be attributed to loss of microbial stimuli during a specific
window of postnatal life corresponding with β-cell developmental milestones. I have also found that unique
bacteria that are enriched during this time are sufficient to restore β-cell development in germ-free mice.
Therefore, I hypothesize that specific microbes induce neonatal β-cell development and that the lack of microbial
diversity that occurs prior to T1D limits the establishment of neonatal β-cells and reduces the chance to outpace
autoimmune destruction. My background in host-microbe interactions and pancreatic development make me
uniquely poised to address this question and the aims herein will provide me with essential training that will both
advance this project as well as my own career goals. I propose to build upon my existing expertise in
gnotobiology by seeking additional training in immunology and diabetes disease models to address important
immune phenotypes involved in β-cell development and to test whether microbes with effects on β-cell
development can modulate disease severity. This training will add new dimension to my knowledge base that
will be broadly applicable to my goal of leading a lab at a top-tier research institution studying the role of the
resident microbiota in pancreatic health and disease. I believe these avenues of research have the potential to
alter our understanding and approach to pancreatic disease etiologies, and my long-term vision is to develop
novel approaches in the fight against diabetes and pancreatic cancer that will improve the quality of human life.
To ensure I succeed in my endeavor to establish a successful independent lab, I have assembled a team of
supportive faculty mentors who are leading experts in the immunology and diabetes fields. The University of
Utah is matchless for this proposal, as it has a concentration of exceptional researchers who collaborate through
institutional organizations such as the Diabetes and Metabolism Research Center. Since graduate school I have
successfully built collaborations and sought out the expertise that have carrier my ideas herein forward from their
inception. This proposal is no exception, and I plan to develop it into a successful platform in my own lab that
can be harnessed toward the prevention and treatment of diabetes."

Nearly one in five Black Americans are first- or second- generation immigrants; however, little research to date
focuses on the experiences of these communities in a disaggregated and/or culturally-specific fashion.
Emerging adults (ages 18-29) from Black immigrant backgrounds face multiple intersecting challenges to their
mental health, as they attempt to transition to adulthood and develop their identity, all while navigating
intergenerational traumas from the immigration process as well as ongoing racism and discrimination faced as
Black people in the United States. Our preliminary research has identified significant mental health disparities
impacting Ethiopian and Eritrean (collectively referred to as habesha) emerging adults in Atlanta. Despite these
threats to mental health and well-being, and the growing representation of habesha and other immigrant
groups within the larger Black population, there are no evidence-based interventions that have been developed
or tested specifically for Black immigrant emerging adults. Our long-term goal is to improve mental health
among habesha emerging adults, as a first step towards ameliorating disparities impacting Black immigrants
more broadly. The objective of this R21 application is to develop and pilot test Weyera, a novel group-level
intervention facilitated by trained community health workers, with a goal to enhance resilience and improve
mental health in this population. This study will pursue two specific aims: (1) To develop Weyera, a culturally-
responsive mental health support intervention for habesha emerging adults; and (2) To conduct a pilot trial of
Weyera and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and safety. For the first aim, we will use the Intervention
Mapping approach and work with our established Youth Advisory Board (comprised of habesha emerging
adults) to refine an intervention outline and develop objectives and activities through a participatory, iterative
process. In the second aim, we will pilot Weyera in a randomized waitlist control trial. Our evaluation will
primarily focus on feasibility, and acceptability and safety, while also exploring potential intervention impacts on
hypothesized effect modifiers (resilience processes: i.e., social support, affirming ethnic identity, mental health
service utilization) and mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety and trauma). We will assess our primary
and secondary outcomes using mixed methods including serial surveys as well as qualitative exit interviews,
and we will also conduct process evaluations to monitor fidelity and adoption. Results from this study will
provide the foundation for a larger efficacy trial of Weyera in the future. The proposed research is highly
significant because of its potential to begin to address the critical gap of knowledge and intervention focused
on habeshas or any Black immigrant group. Attention to understudied nuances including ethnicity, nativity and
immigration status within the Black population is critical to achieving the NIH’s overall goals of addressing the
impacts of racism and discrimination on health."

proposed biochemical and cellular studies are within the scope of the major objectives of the parent grant. The
long-term goal of the candidate is to pursue a career in central nervous system drug development while
mentoring and assisting those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This supplement aims to unveil the source of
subcellular nuclear cAMP after β-adrenergic stimulation, particularly the subcellular adenylyl cyclase (AC)
necessary for nuclear cAMP signal. We aim to test the role of AC5/6, AC9, and soluble AC (sAC) in the β2AR-
induced nuclear cAMP signal. Meanwhile, work from our lab also shows that inhibiting the internalization of the
GRK-pβ2AR attenuates nuclear cAMP. Our lab has shown that the removal of PDE4D5 from the nucleus after β-
adrenergic stimulation is required for GRK-pβ2AR but not PKA-pβ2AR suggesting a distinct but synergistic

will further uncover the proposed GRK-pβ2AR-arrestin-PDE4D axis via pharmacological and molecular probing
of the role of ACs in nuclear cAMP and gene expression. The proposed study will uncover the mechanisms
behind adrenergic signaling regulation, further supporting the findings in the parent grant. The candidate and the

There is an increasing need to develop novel strategies within vital pulp treatment (VPT) to
address limitations in existing therapies and to help overcome tooth injury due to caries,
restorative procedures or trauma. Currently, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge
regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate tertiary dentinogenesis and wound
healing of pulp tissues after injury. This knowledge plays a critical role in preserving pulp tissues
after damage caused by caries and traumatic injury. Our long-term goal is to design new
biologically-based strategies aimed at modulating pulpal inflammation in cases of advanced
pulpitis, as well as to create novel regenerative techniques to therapeutically target biological
processes to stimulate repair of dental pulp. The objective for this application is to elucidate how
MMP13 specifically regulates the dental pulp’s reparative processes as well as the immunological
response in acute pulpitis. The overarching hypothesis is that MMP13 stimulates tertiary dentin
formation and regulates progression of the pulpal inflammatory response in the damaged dentin-
pulp complex. Guided by strong published and preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the influence of MMP13 on
reactionary and reparative tertiary dentin formation, Aim 2: To determine the molecular and
cellular mechanism by which MMP13 regulates the immunological response in pulpitis, and Aim
3: Translate MMP13’s role in tertiary dentin formation and pulpitis to human tissues. Conditional
(odontoblast or myeloid cells specific) MMP13 knockout mice will be used to achieve the first two
aims and the third aim will employ ex vivo human tissue models. Importantly, initial
characterization of our models indicates that MMP13 involved in tertiary dentin formation as well
as inflammatory response after tooth injury in vivo. Translationally, our data will lead to the
identification and understanding of important mediators, so that novel targeted therapeutic
solutions can be designed within Cariology and Regenerative Endodontics. This will lessen the
burden of existing therapies aimed to treat damaged pulp affected by caries and traumatic injury."
11058792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in California have reached epidemic levels that exceed national
rates. Half of these infections occur among youth ages 15–24, and rates are disproportionately higher in sexual
and gender minority (SGM) adolescents and young adults (AYA). Latine SGM AYA have been shown to have
worse mental, physical, and sexual health outcomes than non-SGM AYA and have experiences of
discrimination including racism and homophobia. Yet, research is lacking on the experiences of Latine SGM
AYA who reside in rural settings who may have increased concerns around confidentiality and stigma in their
communities. This critical gap in evidence has impeded the development of interventions to address the needs
of rural Latine SGM AYA to increase their access to preventative sexual health services. The overarching goal
of this supplement is to understand social, cultural, and structural influences (social determinants) on sexual
health among rural Latine SGM AYA, such as those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer,
intersex and other genders or sexualities (LGBTQI+) in emerging adulthood (ages 18–21). This study will be a 1-
year research supplement to the A Crecer cohort study (R01HD075787). The parent study follows a cohort of
adolescents from age 13 into young adulthood at age 21 in Salinas, California, to understand the social factors
that affect sexual health among Latine AYA. In the proposed supplemental study, we will analyze existing data
and conduct supplementary data collection by recruiting an additional 50 SGM AYA from the study area through
community organizations that serve this population. Currently, about 20% (n=73) of the cohort identifies as
SGM. This supplementary data collection will allow us to compare sexual health outcomes by SGM identity and
to better understand the experiences of SGM AYA in this area. In Aim 1, we will characterize disparities in
sexual health outcomes associated with SGM identity in emerging adulthood. Sexual health outcomes include
preventing pregnancy and/or STIs, accessing sexual health services, condom use, dating violence, and
satisfaction in sexual relationships. We will analyze quantitative data already collected from the A Crecer Phase
2 cohort and include the supplementary sample to characterize disparities in sexual health outcomes. In Aim 2,
we will explore AYA identity development and socio-cultural influences on SGM AYA’s experiences with their
sexual relationships, health, and well-being. We will conduct in-depth interviews (~20) with purposively selected
SGM AYA to understand their needs for and experiences in caring for their sexual well-being as well as
perceived socio-cultural influences on their sexual health and how that has shifted over time as their identity has
developed. Our established infrastructure, partnerships, and existing cohort position us for efficient initiation and

11059262,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 2 
Underserved breast cancer screening populations, including those that are predominantly composed of racial/ethnic minorities, lower income, lower educated, and rural populations, continue to have a higher breast cancer morbidity and mortality burden than their counterparts. These populations tend to have lower follow-up rates after abnormal screening, more missed cancers, and more advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis. Drivers of inequities are likely multi-factorial and include not only woman-level enabling factors but also neighborhood-level social determinants of health and facility-level factors that influence access to and use of high quality screening, timely diagnostic evaluation, and treatment. The National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities, on behalf of the NIH, reports that a major barrier in achieving health equity is that prior disparities research efforts have focused on individual enabling factors rather than neighborhood or healthcare delivery factors. Understanding the impact of breast imaging facility-level drivers of inequities is particularly important as new screening technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), are rapidly adopted in clinical practice. If newer technologies do not diffuse equitably across communities, persistent breast cancer disparities may be further exacerbated. Our overall project objective is to identify modifiable breast imaging facility-level factors that drive breast cancer screening disparities. Using an observational cohort study design and simulation modeling, we will explore how targeted facility-level changes that aim to increase access to and use of routine screening and targeted use of AI for improved imaging interpretation accuracy can promote greater equity in screening outcomes. We will leverage the robust, longitudinal, multi-level Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data across eight regional U.S. breast imaging registries to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) Perform multi-level analyses to identify facility-level factors (e.g., on-site technologies) that drive disparities in screening performance and outcomes. Aim 2) Using a retrospective matched case control design and five commercially available AI technologies, evaluate whether commercially available AI tools for automated mammography interpretation can aid low-performing facilities to meet or exceed national mammography performance benchmarks. Aim 3) Using three established microsimulation models and results from Aims 1 and 2, estimate the long-term, population-level benefits, harms, and costs of enacting facility-level quality-of-care interventions (e.g., AI for higher performance) for the overall U.S. screening population and for underserved subpopulations. Elevating the quality-of-care at low-performing facilities has the potential to tip the balance towards greater screening benefits and less harms at the population-level, while also promoting health equity."
11072888,"Abstract
One of the most remarkable properties of the brain is its ability to undergo adaptive modifications in
response to changing environments. This experience-dependent plasticity is essential not only for the fine-
tuning of developing circuits, but also for learning in adults. Advanced fluorescent labeling and imaging
techniques have enabled direct visualization of the structural and functional reorganization of neuronal
circuits during learning. Dendritic spines have been a major focus of these studies; spine gain or loss is
associated with formation or elimination of neural circuit connections, and the enlargement or shrinkage of
spines accompanies increases or decreases in the strength of synaptic connections. Notably, neurological
and neurodegenerative disorders that result in cognitive dysfunction and disrupt learning are usually
associated with changes in the density or morphology of dendritic spines. The long-term goal of this
research proposal is to elucidate the molecular signaling mechanisms that regulate the growth, stabilization,
and functional maturation of dendritic spines and their associated synapses during the activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity that is associated with learning. To achieve this goal, we will use two-photon imaging and
photostimulation techniques combined with genetically-encoded biosensors and fluorescence lifetime
imaging to measure spatiotemporal signaling in neuronal dendrites, and molecular genetic,
pharmacological, biochemical and proteomic techniques to identify key signaling pathways and complexes
that regulate excitatory synapse plasticity. In Aim 1, we will delineate the unexpected role of the RhoGEF
Ephexin5 and its downstream signaling pathways the activity-dependent spine growth and stabilization that
is vital for learning and how these pathways are altered in cellular models for studying Alzheimer’s disease.
In Aim 2, we will elucidate the novel non-enzymatic roles and interactions partners of CaMKII in nascent
spine growth and stabilization as new circuit connections are established and we will define how these
signaling pathways contribute to synaptic dysfunction in models for studying Alzheimer’s disease. Results
from these experiments will rigorously address novel and unexpected molecular mechanisms of excitatory
synapse growth and stabilization, thereby filling gaps in our current understanding of learning-associated
neural circuit plasticity, with the ultimate goal to facilitate the development of therapeutics for human
diseases associated with intellectual disability."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. The parent Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) Project proposal for the Pediatric Immunotherapy
Network is focused on high-risk neuroblastoma, a diverse and enigmatic malignancy arising from the developing
sympathetic nervous system that remains lethal in 50% of patients despite intensive multi-modal therapy. There
is an urgent unmet need for developing novel therapeutic interventions to decrease the incidence of relapse,
increase overall survival, and reduce devastating toxicities associated with standard therapy. The primary goal
of this Project is to achieve improved outcomes for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma through the
development of a personalized vaccination strategy targeting individualized neoantigens. The central hypothesis
is that high-risk neuroblastomas, despite a low tumor mutation burden (TMB), harbor a sufficient number of
neoepitopes through canonical and non-canonical mutations to identify, predict, and validate optimal neoantigen
peptides to engineer effective multivalent personalized neuroblastoma vaccines. The motivation for the proposed
research is the urgent need to improve survival and to decrease treatment-related morbidities for patients with
high-risk neuroblastoma. Indeed, the majority of high-risk neuroblastoma patients achieve a remission with
standard therapy, and here we seek to engage the adaptive immune system to eradicate residual disease and
prevent relapse. We will test our hypothesis through the two Specific Aims: 1) define the neoantigen landscape
of high-risk neuroblastoma patient and genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) tumors; 2) develop and
test a readily translatable personalized vaccination strategy.
In this new supplemental application, we take advantage of the expertise of the expertise of Dr. Drew Weissman
and his University of Pennsylvania RNA Innovation Institute to develop mRNA-based lipid nanoparticle
personalized neuroblastoma vaccines to be tested in parallel with the multivalent peptide vaccines we are
pursuing in the parent award. This will extend the potential impact of this U01 Project by providing an alternative
path to clinical translation that may have advantages that we will define in this supplemental sub-Project."

11079323,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has robust anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) properties and is thought to be a stress resilience
factor. Clinical and pre-clinical studies have shown that NPY signaling regulates stress-dependent behavior in
both humans and rodents. Our knowledge of the mechanisms by which NPY affects synaptic and circuit function
to alter behavior is incomplete. NPY has been implicated in a wide variety of anxiety disorders, including post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Low levels of NPY have been measured in patients with PTSD and in animals
exposed to traumatic stress. Modulation of NPY has been proposed as a potential therapy for PTSD and other
anxiety disorders. The hippocampus has been implicated in anxiety disorders including PTSD, which can be
considered maladaptive forms of learning. NPY and its receptors are found at high levels in hippocampus, and
direct injections of NPY into hippocampus attenuate avoidance behavior in rodents. Importantly, the levels of
NPY in hippocampus are reduced in rodents exposed to traumatic stress. The mechanism underlying this
decrease is not known. However, the reduction in NPY expression by traumatic stress is important, because
injection of NPY into hippocampus alleviates behavioral symptoms. In the previous funding period, we showed
that traumatic stress causes the loss of NPY release in the temporammonic pathway in the CA1 region of
hippocampus, a pathway that is important for memory consolidation and fear learning. In this funding period, we
will determine the effects of NPY release in the TA pathway on hippocampal circuit function and behavior,
investigate the mechanisms of decreased NPY release caused by traumatic stress, and test whether enhancing
release of NPY in the TA pathway can rescue the behavioral effects of traumatic stress. These studies could
lead to new therapeutic strategies to alleviate anxiety symptoms in PTSD patients."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to lower the age of detection in autism to early infancy, making
presymptomatic (i.e., before the emergence of ASD-specific behavioral features) intervention feasible. Infants
with an older autistic sibling have up to a 20% risk of developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prospective
high familial risk (HR) infant sibling studies have shown that the defining behaviors of ASD do not emerge until
the latter part of the first year and into the second year of life. Therefore, the vast majority of affected children
are diagnosed after age 2. No behavioral markers in the first year of life have yet been identified that can predict
later ASD diagnosis with sufficient accuracy (i.e., positive predictive value: PPV ≥ 80%) to justify presymptomatic
intervention. We recently published two independent approaches that use brain imaging in the first year of life to
predict which HR infants will be diagnosed with ASD at 2 years of age. Specifically, structural MRI (sMRI) at 6
and 12 months of age, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) at 6 months of age independently
predicted later ASD diagnosis in HR infants with over 80% PPV. Our preliminary data show that a third MRI
approach, using regions of CSF volume and cortical shape at 6 months of age can also accurately predict later
ASD diagnosis. If we replicate and extend these findings, we will be able to identify individual infants at “ultra-
high risk” (80% chance) of developing ASD, rather than being limited to group-level risk (20% chance), where
we do not know who will later be affected. This R01 application aims to move our initial findings toward a clinical
test for ASD in HR infants in the first year of life. Aim 1 will validate our previous findings in a new, independent
sample of HR infants, extend our methods to a new MRI platform, and examine whether fcMRI and/or sMRI, with
and without behavioral information, during the presymptomatic period in infancy, accurately predict ASD
diagnosis at 24 months of age. Aim 2 will move beyond predicting categorical diagnosis to predicting
dimensional, clinically-relevant characteristics for individual infants. Specific dimensional targets include
expressive language level, social responsiveness, initiation of joint attention, and repetitive behavior. Validating
and extending our findings on presymptomatic prediction of ASD in a new sample, on a different MRI scanner,
and with dimensional developmental characteristics are critical next steps for moving the field forward toward (a)
the development of a clinically-useful, presymptomatic test for identifying ultra-high risk infants who would benefit
from very early intervention in infancy, (b) efficient studies of presymptomatic intervention strategies in individuals
at ultra-high risk, and (c) the development of future presymptomatic tests for use in the general (not just HR)
population."

24-032.” Couples where both members smoke (i.e. dual-smoker couples; DSCs) are highly prevalent and
particularly unlikely to achieve abstinence. Within DSCs, little attention has been paid to understanding the
unique needs of sexual and/or gender minority (SGM) couples (i.e., couples with at least one individual
identifying as SGM). Although SGM groups remain underrepresented in research, evidence strongly suggests
they experience a disproportionate cancer burden, with tobacco being a leading cause of preventable disease
and death among SGM groups.7–12 SGM and non-SGM individuals share a similar desire to quit smoking27 and
awareness of evidence-based cessation methods,28 thus motivation and knowledge barriers are not likely driving
smoking disparities. SGM people have expressed a preference for SGM-tailored smoking cessation assistance, 29
which currently does not take a dyadic approach. Among individuals with SGM identities, there is variability in
smoking behavior and cessation outcomes. Understanding the drivers of smoking behavior and barriers to
cessation observed among SGM people within DSCs may improve cessation assistance for this group, thereby
improving cancer outcomes for individuals at the intersection of these hard-to-reach groups.
 In the context of parent trial R01CA275494, we propose understanding the unique factors that contribute to
smoking behavior and cessation among SGM individuals in DSCs. Using quantitative methodology, we aim to
evaluate the heterogeneity of SGM DSCs regarding relationship dynamics, sexual orientation and gender
identity (SOGI) stressors and strengths, broader social environmental factors, and cessation-related impulsivity
in relation to smoking and cessation-related behaviors. Using qualitative methodology, we aim to understand
the unique smoking and cessation-related stressors, motives, and relationship dynamics experienced by SGM
DSCs to inform measure development for future studies examining within-group heterogeneity. Finally, we will
expand the recruitment of SGM couples for inclusion in the parent project. Individuals who identify as SGM and
have smoking partners will be invited to complete a survey in which we assess smoking and cessation-related
behaviors as well as relationship dynamics, sexual and gender identity-related stressors and strengths,
smoking-related impulsivity, and smoking behaviors. We will conduct one-on-one, semi-structured in-depth
interviews with a purposively sampled subset of these individuals to gather an understanding of the factors
influencing current smoking, past quit attempts, and considerations of future quit attempts in SGMs in a DSC.
These interviews will elicit rich discussion surrounding, barriers, facilitators, and relationship dynamics as an SGM-
identified person in a DSC. Following separate analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data, findings will be
examined side-by-side in a convergence coding matrix. The findings are intended to develop culturally
appropriate cessation interventions to better support the needs of SGM individuals with smoking partners."
11056262,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SCA1 is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of CAG repeats in the
ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) gene. Patients with SCA1 suffer from progressive gait and balance deficits, and severe
degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellar cortex and neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CbN). There
are no effective disease modifying therapies currently available for SCA1, indicating a critical need for better
understanding of disease pathogenesis.
Cerebellar nuclei are a key part of the cerebellar network and the main information output from the cerebellum.
As a consequence, CbN are relevant to motor behaviors regulated by the cerebellum. Remarkably, very little is
known about the dysfunction of CbN in any of the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1. The
research described in this proposal will determine how CbN function is altered throughout SCA1 progression,
how mutant ATXN1 (mATXN1) impacts the CbN, and how changes in CbN contribute to SCA1-like motor
deficits. An additional impact of this study will be to expand the concept of SCA1 as a cerebellar circuit
dysfunction disease, stimulating future studies into interactions of the cerebellar cortex and CbN, not only in
SCA1, but in other ataxias as well."

 In most organs, the vasculature is permeable to many blood-borne molecules and cells, but the vessels of
the nervous system tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules and cells between the blood and the
nervous tissue. In this way, the vasculature of the nervous system rigorously controls the neural environment to
allow for proper neuronal function, and protect the neural tissue from toxins and pathogens. The blood nerve
barrier (BNB) is the set of vascular characteristics that describes this strict regulation in the peripheral nervous
system (PNS) and is analogous in function to the blood brain barrier (BBB) in the central nervous system (CNS).
Dysfunction of either of these barrier properties has been associated with various pathologies including diabetic
peripheral neuropathy in the PNS and multiple sclerosis in the CNS. Researchers have made great strides in
answering many fundamental questions about BBB biology, especially by leveraging the use of RNA sequencing
to identify genes of importance. In contrast, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms
responsible for BNB function in health and dysfunction in disease. Although the differences in cell types between
the CNS and PNS are well known, no one has performed an in-depth molecular comparison of the BBB and
BNB. Given the clinical relevance of BBB and BNB dysfunction in disease, a thorough comparison of both would
be valuable to advance novel therapeutics for both PNS and CNS diseases, alike. As such, the principal goal
of this proposal is to leverage the use of single cell RNA sequencing technology to compare the gene
expression of the key cell types that form the BNB and BNB under physiological conditions, and
characterize changes in the gene expression of the BNB during diabetic peripheral neuropathy. To
accomplish this, we will first perform single cell RNA sequencing comparing adult mouse sciatic and optic nerves
since these are analogous regions from the PNS and CNS and will have BNB and BBB vasculature, respectively.
We will then perform single cell RNA sequencing on sciatic nerves from diabetic mice at early, mid, and late-
stages of the disease, comparing them with healthy controls. Overall, this proposal will provide transcriptomic
information on the differences between the BNB and BBB in health and BNB dysfunction in a diabetic model,
providing a framework for a more complete understanding of the BNB in an aim to develop novel therapeutic
strategies."

 Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) are a natural component of mammalian gastrointestinal
microbiota (Davin-Regli and Pagès, 2015; Ramirez and Giron, 2020), but also found in a wide range of foods
and can potentially serve as foodborne pathogens (Healy et al., 2010; Shaker et al., 2007;Capita et al., 2020;
Gwida et al., 2014; Kilonzo-Nthenge et al., 2013). A recent study has identified multi-drug resistant ECC in raw
tomatoes, lettuce, carrots and other fresh vegetables that were intended for direct human consumption in
Spain (Pintor-Cora et al., 2023).
 ECC and E. aerogenes are recognized as the most predominant nosocomial clinical pathogens within
the Enterobacter genus, often linked to infection outbreaks (Davin-Regli and Pagès, 2015; Mezzatesta et al.,
2012). Over the past three decades, they emerged as highly significant opportunistic, and multi-drug resistant
pathogens in hospital settings (Gaston, 1988). These infections, ranging from urinary tract infections,
pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis, pose significant risks particularly for immunocompromised individuals
(Annavajhala et al., 2019; Girlich et al., 2021; Intra et al., 2023). Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in
Enterobacteriaceae represents a global public health concern (John Jr et al., 1982; Ramirez and Giron, 2020).
Klebsiella species and Enterobacter species, including ECC isolates, are recognized as the most prevalent
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in the United States (Annavajhala et al., 2019; Lutgring,
2019; Mezzatesta et al., 2012).
 In recent years, many antibiotics commonly used to treat Enterobacter infections, including ECC-
associated diseases, have been alarmingly less effective(Sanders Jr and Sanders, 1997). This trend is
attributed to the intrinsic β-lactam resistance observed in ECC species, primarily due to expression of low
levels of ampC genes encoding for an inducible AmpC-type cephalosporinase (Annavajhala et al., 2019;
Seeberg et al., 1983). This unique chromosomal β-lactam mechanism enables ECC species to resist the
bactericidal effect of Penicillins and first- and second-generation Cephalosporins. In cases of prolonged
exposure to β-lactam drugs, ECC species may even exhibit resistance to third generation Cephalosporins
(Seeberg et al., 1983).
 The Vet-LIRN AMR monitoring program has collected and sequenced approximately 200 ECC strains,
and determined their corresponding AMR phenotypes. KSVDL routinely receives ECC-positive diagnostic
samples. The objectives of this project are to isolate ~20 ECC isolates from KSVDL submitted specimens,
obtain genome sequences and determine AMR phenotypes, then perform a comparative analysis of AMR
phenotypes of these ECC genome sequences alongside the 200 ECC strains from the Vet-LIRN AMR
monitoring program."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, lupus) is a multi-organ autoimmune disease with 5-10%
mortality in 10 years. Skin is severely affected by this disease and sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV)
sunlight rays affects up to 80% of patients. The immunologic mechanisms involved in cutaneous
lupus (CLE) remain poorly understood. In particular, the role of different types of T cells, highly
prevalent lymphocytes in CLE skin, is unknown. The overall objectives in this proposal are: (i) to
profile and determine the function of MAIT cells in CLE in relation to the skin microbiome and (ii)
to define the role of MAIT cells in lupus skin disease and photosensitive responses in vivo. The
central hypothesis is that activation of MAIT cells, influenced by preferential expansion of
riboflavin-producing bacteria, mediates skin pathogenesis in CLE. The rationale for this project
stems from the gap in the knowledge of how the altered microbiome in lupus skin impacts immune
activation, and specifically MAIT cells, and leads to tissue damage. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1 Define how skin microbiome shapes MAIT cell function in
CLE patients and 2) Establish how lupus-specific interactions between skin microbiota and MAIT
cells mediate cutaneous lupus in vivo. Under the first aim, MAIT cells from lupus skin (lesional
and unaffected) will be evaluated for quantity, heterogeneity, transcriptomic signatures, and TCR
usage (relative to healthy skin) and these findings analyzed in relation to the abundance of
microbial communities and riboflavin gene expression. For the second aim, the role of MAIT cells
in the development of lupus skin disease will be evaluated in Mrl-lpr mice deficient in MAIT cells
(Mrl.lprMR1-/-). This new murine strain will be used to investigate how dermal association with
riboflavin or Staphylococcus bacteria influences MAIT cell function in spontaneous and UV light-
accelerated CLE in vivo. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will
generate a novel mechanism of lupus skin disease and interrogate a T cell population reported to
have inflammatory properties in other skin disease but has not yet been studied in CLE. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a strong scientific rationale to
address the imbalance in lupus skin microbiome and/or modulate MAIT cells for therapeutic
purposes in lupus skin disease."
11054174,"The overall goal of this administrative supplement is to adapt Reflexiones, our electronic screening and brief
intervention (e-SBI) program to reduce substance use and sexual risk behavior among men who have sex with
men (MSM) in Argentina, for MSM in the U.S. MSM are disproportionally affected by HIV and substance abuse
in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. However, as in the general population, identifying and engaging MSM
with problematic substance use (PSU) into treatment is a significant challenge, which results in the great majority
of MSM with PSU never receiving treatment. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) recommends Screening (S), Brief Intervention (BI), and Referral to Treatment (RT; SBIRT) as an
early intervention for non-treatment-seeking individuals with risky alcohol and drug use, as well as the timely
referral to more intensive substance abuse treatment for those with substance use disorders. To address this
need, we developed Reflexiones, an e-SBI aimed at reducing substance use and HIV sexual risk behavior among
MSM seeking HIV testing at Nexo Asociacion Civil, our community partners in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our
formative work and pilot (N=46) of Reflexiones has been highly encouraging. On an acceptability assessment
based on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability 100% of participants agreed the intervention was
acceptable (23% “agreed” and 77% “totally agreed”) and, in qualitative interviews, participants noted how the
intervention helped them reflect on their substance use and sexual risk behavior, topics they did not discuss with
others. All participants felt the intervention was non-judgmental and respectful of individuals who use substances,
which they felt was critical given the “taboo” behaviors discussed. While Reflexiones was designed for MSM in
Buenos Aires, the need for interventions to reduce PSU and sexual risk behavior among MSM in the U.S. is
equally great. As such, the overall goal of this administrative supplement is to adapt and pilot Reflexiones for
MSM in U.S. who are seeking HIV testing at CAN Community Health, our community collaborators in Florida, a
state with seven EHE high-risk counties. While Reflexiones benefits from having been designed for MSM, it must
undergo a formal adaptation process to address issues that have not been relevant in Argentina (e.g., racial and
ethnic representation and language) and its acceptability assessed among the demographically diverse MSM
that typically seek HIV testing in community testing sites in the U.S. To this end, we have partnered with CAN
Community Health to assess its acceptability among intended users and its feasibility during HIV testing visits.
The Specific Aims of this administrative supplement are to 1) Adapt Reflexiones to MSM in the U.S. (renamed

11054712,"Project Summary: Developing disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases has been challenging, in part
because accurate statistical models to identify the optimal time for intervention do not exist. Models of how symptoms
worsen over time (i.e., the symptom trajectory) before and after a clinical diagnosis can help identify that optimal time.
These models can help pinpoint when a therapy could prevent a clinical diagnosis, or slow the disease after a clinical
diagnosis.
 Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy even for Huntington disease, a disease for which researchers
can track symptoms in patients guaranteed to develop it. Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Huntington disease
progresses slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before clinical diagnosis. This makes time to
clinical diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient's motor abnormalities will merit a clinical diagnosis sometime after the
last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model the symptom
trajectory before and after clinical diagnosis without full information about when clinical diagnosis occurs. The challenge
creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored covariate, time
to clinical diagnosis.
 Tackling this problem by modeling the distribution for time to clinical diagnosis has long been thought to be
the best strategy. For years, we and others worked to develop reliable distribution models, but we found that if the
model is even slightly wrong, we get biased estimates of how the symptom trajectory changes as a function of time
to clinical diagnosis. This bias causes problems for clinical trials because they are incorrectly powered to determine
if a therapy modiﬁes the disease course with statistical signiﬁcance. We began seeking a strategy that estimates the
symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis without needing to accurately model the distribution for
time to clinical diagnosis. Our team developed such a strategy for a related problem: estimating a regression model
that has a covariate measured with error. Like a right-censored covariate, when a covariate is measured with error,
the covariate's true value and distribution are unknown. Rather than ﬁnding the correct distribution, our nontraditional
strategy accurately estimates the regression model even when the distribution for the covariate is mismodeled.
 Our overarching objective is to develop a similarly robust strategy when we have a right-censored covariate, which
requires tackling challenges in three new areas: noninformative censoring (Aim 1), informative censoring (Aim 2), and
handling longitudinal measures of the symptom trajectory (Aim 3). Upon completion, our work will produce robust
estimates of the Huntington disease symptom trajectory as a function of time to clinical diagnosis. The work is timely,
given recent therapies that show potential for modifying the course of Huntington disease. Correctly powered clinical
trials will enable researchers to test these therapies and determine if they modify the disease course. Our strategy could
help design these clinical trials and push forward the science of Huntington disease and other neurodegenerative diseases."
11054713,"Abstract
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity produces calcium-rich excitatory currents that control the
physiology of central synapses. Ongoing excitatory transmission through NMDA receptors is essential for
moment by moment consciousness and cognition. In addition, permeating calcium drives long-term changes in
the strength of synapses to initiate learning and memory formation. Excessive NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
entry kills neurons and is a disease mechanism in stroke and age-related chronic pathologies such as
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Despite being sensitive to multiple small-molecule modulators, the potential of
NMDA receptors as therapeutic targets remains unrealized due to insufficient knowledge about the structural
changes that make their activation reaction. Moreover, recent advances in diagnosis with genetic sequencing
has identified a large number of unique variants in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Many of these
variants are causal to the disease, but the mechanism by which they affect the reaction mechanism, and
therefore function is unknown.
The overall objective of this research program is to describe the NMDA receptor activation, which consists of
stochastic transitions between closed, open, and desensitized states, with a level of detail that integrates atomic-
level structural information obtained from static receptor conformations with coarse-grained and atomistic
molecular dynamic simulations. These structural results will be tested with kinetic and thermodynamic
measurements of NMDA receptor current output.
At the completion of the proposed study, we will have identified atomic structures representative for each of the
three main functional states (closed, open, desensitized) and how these structures interconvert; will delineate
key atomic interactions that control these changes in structure; and will describe how the dynamic distribution of
receptors across this conformational landscape controls the patterns of depolarization and calcium influx
produced by NMDA receptors. Furthermore, we will then interrogate the resulting integrated mechanism to
examine how disease-related mutations and small-molecule modulators affect the conformational dynamics of
receptors and how they alter the NMDA receptor current.
The project will produce a congruent model that can be used to develop small-molecule modulators targeted to
specific receptor conformations that would reduce calcium flux independently of excitatory action, and will guide

 Chronic pain is pain that persists past the normal time of healing. 1.5 billion people
worldwide suffer from chronic pain and this number continues to increase as the elderly population
grows, the prevalence of diabetes rises, and cancer survival rates improve. Chronic pain not only
severely impacts daily quality of life for many patients, it also places a heavy socioeconomic
burden on society. Due to the limited number of efficacious treatment options available, chronic
pain is often treated with opioids despite the risk of addiction and side effects. Unfortunately, the
prescribing of opioids to treat chronic pain has largely fueled the current opioid epidemic.
Therefore, there is an urgent and clear unmet need for non-addictive alternative analgesics for
the treatment of chronic pain. The push to develop specific and non-addictive alternative
painkillers has brought interest to a particular sodium channel, NaV1.7, shown to be important for
pain sensing. Gain-of-function mutations in NaV1.7 are associated with a disorder characterized
by intense burning pain in the extremities: primary erythromelalgia. Conversely, loss-of function
of NaV1.7 results in the inability to feel pain. Therefore, inhibiting NaV1.7 can be an effective
method of reducing pain and treat erythromelalgia patients. To accomplish this, we designed
epigenetic modulators to repress expression of NaV1.7. Rather than making permanent edits to
the genome, these epigenetic modulators will transiently inhibit expression of NaV1.7. By targeting
NaV1.7 at the DNA-level, we can achieve specific and long-lasting modulation of NaV1.7, with
better pharmacokinetics prospects than RNA- and protein-targeting approaches. In this study, we
propose to optimize these epigenetic modulators as well as their delivery in order to achieve high
specificity and efficacy. In addition, we will evaluate our optimized modulators in small-scale
manufacturing studies as well as toxicological studies in a large animal model. The result of this
study will be an optimized gene therapy that is not only non-addictive and efficacious for treatment
of chronic pain but also highly specific and long-lasting."

HIV is the epidemic of our time; South Africa is its epicenter. Current interventions are denting the epidemic but
are unlikely to achieve the UNAIDS goal of ending HIV by 2030. In South Africa, new infections continue: in
2018, 240 000 new infections added to the 7.7 million South Africans living with HIV. South Africa has the
largest ARV program in the world, but treatment as prevention has not stalled new infections. Although
progress has been made in controlling pediatric HIV, we have yet to meet the Joint United Nations Programme
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) elimination targets. The significant TB burden amongst people living with HIV
destabilizes TB control efforts. Taken together, these realities underscore the need to find effective biomedical
interventions to prevent HIV, address the long-term management of HIV throughout the age spectrum, and
investigate HIV remission. Ongoing research investment is vital to our attempt to achieve epidemic control.
NIH-sponsored research has led to vital advances in both treatment and prevention. Our proposed PHRU-
Setshaba Clinical Trials Unit (CTU), with seven Clinical Research Sites (CRS), is strategically positioned in
high HIV prevalence and incidence geographic hotspots. Our access to informal settlements, maternity units,
TB clinics and hospitals enables the CTU to investigate the prevention and control of HIV and TB. Our PHRU-
Setshaba CTU has the long-term objective to support the scientific agenda of the four NIH HIV/AIDS Clinical
Trials Networks to reduce the impact of HIV and TB on infants, children, adolescents and adults. Our CTU
comprises of internationally renowned scientists, based in South Africa, predominantly women, from diverse
racial and ethnic backgrounds, with a track record of capacity development. To contribute to the scientific
agenda of the NIH HIV/AIDS Clinical Trials Networks, the CTU intends to: 1) evaluate novel active HIV
vaccination strategies that may be efficacious by inducing non-neutralizing vaccine immune responses; 2)
evaluate passive neutralization utilizing one or more monoclonal antibodies for biomedical prevention; 3)
investigate the role of alternatives to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis such as long-acting antiretrovirals and
multi-purpose prevention technologies; 4) assess HIV vaccines to prevent breastmilk transmission of HIV; 5)
contribute to finding HIV treatment options that reduce long-term side-effects in both adults and children; 6)
support research into HIV remission and 7) to contribute to the TB research agenda for TB prevention and
therapeutics. We aim to achieve this by operating an efficient CTU that will oversee the execution of quality
clinical research which is regulatory and ethically compliant, in partnership with our communities, as well as by
developing a successor generation of diverse scientists."
11075014,"Abstract
 Epilepsy is the most prevalent neurological diseases after migraines. Current antiepileptic drug
treatments mainly attempt to reduce excitation or enhance inhibition in order to control seizures. Unfortunately,
such therapeutics result in a number of undesirable side-effects, and demonstrate limited efficacy against drug-
resistant cases of epilepsy. So far, no treatment has been developed as an anti-epileptogenic agent, in part
because of the limited understanding of the processes involved in the development of epilepsy. It is generally
accepted that up to 50% of all epileptic patients become epileptic as a result of a triggering initial injury such as
status epilepticus, stroke or traumatic brain injury. This initial triggering injury has been postulated to activate a
cascade of events leading to further seizures, increased brain damage and self-propagation. Intranasal delivery
of a variety of anti-epileptic drugs is increasingly used, as it provides significant advantages over traditional
delivery routes. These include increased efficacy, decreased side-effects and increased patient compliance,
suggesting that novel treatments could benefit from this mode of administration.
 Calpains are a family of soluble calcium-dependent proteases, which have been implicated in epilepsy since
they are activated by seizures and participate in neuronal damage. Recent studies have also indicated that
during early epileptogenesis, seizure occurrence, calpain activity and neuronal damage are correlated, and that
treatment with a non-selective calpain inhibitor reduces the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures
(SRSs) in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats. Our laboratory has demonstrated that calpain-1 and calpain-
2, two of the major calpain isoforms in the brain, have opposite functions in the brain. We have also found that
calpain-2 conditional knock-out mice with calpain-2 deletion in excitatory neurons from the forebrain show normal
seizure activity following injections of repeated low doses of kainic acid (KA) but exhibit no brain inflammation,
degeneration and impairment in hippocampus-dependent learning 7 days after seizures. Similar protective
results were obtained when wild-type mice were treated daily and for seven days after seizures with a selective
calpain-2 inhibitor, NA-112. These results strongly support the novel hypothesis that calpain-2 might represent
a potential therapeutic target to prevent various pathological consequences of seizures. This Phase I STTR is
directed at determining whether intranasal administration of NA-112, can prevent the appearance of SRSs or
reduce their frequency as well as prevent the various manifestations of neuropathology (brain inflammation,
neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment) in two mouse models of epilepsy, the repeated low doses of kainic
acid (KA) or of pilocarpine models. In Phase II of this STTR, we will further pursue the development of intranasal
delivery of NA-112 as an anti-epileptogenic drug. NeurAegis is a small biotech company focusing on the
development of selective calpain-2 inhibitors for the treatment of acute neuronal injury, including traumatic brain
injury and repeated concussions. This proposal is directed at expanding the potential applications of these
calpain-2 inhibitors by determining whether they could also be developed as potential therapeutic treatment for
epilepsy."

Background: Fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3) is the most commonly mutated gene in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and mutations in FLT3 are associated with high relapse rates. FLT3
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are clinically active in FLT3-mutant AML but duration of
response is limited by the development of resistance. Mutations in NRAS and other activation
of the RAS pathway are major mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors and other AML
targeted therapies. Rationale: We have identified suppression of the Mediator/RNA Pol II
pathway augments FLT3 TKI-induced apoptosis in the setting of RAS activation. The overall
goals of this project are: (1) to prioritize therapeutic targets in the Mediator/RNA Pol II pathway;
and (2) to determine the essential Mediator/RNA Pol II-dependent transcriptional targets
relevant to FLT3 TKI resistance. Methods: We will identify essential components of the RNA Pol
II pathway needed for TKI resistance in AML and evaluate the efficacy of existing RNA Pol II
pathway inhibitors in MAPK-activated AML cells. We will determine RNA Pol II-dependent
transcriptional changes induced by MAPK activation and FLT3 inhibition in pre-clinical models
and patient samples. We will functionally validate the essential downstream transcriptional
targets critical to RAS-mediated FLT3 TKI resistance in AML. Expected Results: These studies
will rigorously evaluate RNA Pol II as a novel treatment strategy in AML with aberrant
RAS/MAPK signaling. If successful, this strategy can be quickly translated to clinical trials in
AML and this general approach may also prove efficacious in other RAS-mutant cancers."
11073370,"Project Summary
The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies are
characterized by progressive deposition Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites composed primarily of phosphorylated alpha-
synuclein aggregates (α-syn), neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier compromise, and neurodegeneration. Currently, there
are no clinically approved biomarker diagnostic tools or disease modifying treatments for PD. Clinical diagnosis is based
on a combination of motor and nonmotor symptoms, but the neurodegeneration process may precede the first appearance
of these symptoms by decades. Empirical data suggests that levels of oligomeric α-syn in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
PD patients surpass those of normal individuals by several orders of magnitude. Oligomeric α-syn and reactive gliosis are
strongly implicated in the initiation and spread of the disease. Recent data from clinical trials with anti-amyloid-β (anti-Aβ)
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), (despite lack of clarity in the full safety/efficacy profile),
suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker outcomes, demonstrating that neurodegenerative
amyloidosis disorders can be slowed or halted. Over the past decade, we have demonstrated in several mouse models of
neurodegeneration that following tail vein injection, liposomes bearing an imaging contrast payload cross the BBB into the
CSF, primarily at the blood-CSF barrier at the at the choroid plexus and cerebrovascular leaks and bind to specific targets
within the brain, enabling separation of disease mice from controls using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
or computed tomography imaging. Our lead product is currently in clinical trials as the first MRI-based imaging agents for
Aβ plaques in AD. In a recent proposal funded by the NIA (R21 AG067131), we hypothesized that a variant of our agent
labeled with oligomeric α-syn ligands will act as a scavenger for the pathologic species resulting in the formation of cross-
linked agglomerates of the agent and pathologic species making them more suitable substrates for rapid phagocytosis (sizes
> 0.5 microns) by activated glia. This in turn can lead to momentary accumulation of detectable levels of the agent in PD
positive brains enabling noninvasive separation of test subjects from controls. Our preliminary data demonstrates successful
in vitro formation of agglomerates upon exposure of the agent to α-syn fibrils and accelerated uptake of the ensuing
agglomerates by microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines. In vivo administration by tail vein injection followed by MRI
showed statistically significant signal enhancement in the brains of transgenic mice versus controls. The in vivo data was
verified by ex-vivo immunohistochemical analysis which showed a correlation between in vivo MRI signal, regional
distribution of the agent in brain tissue, Lewy pathology, and microglia activity. In this application, we seek to capitalize on
this data and our experience in the area to fully establish the preclinical potential of our nano scavenger concept both as
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PD. Specifically, we propose to test the efficacy of the agent to profile/halt disease
progression from the prodromal stage through early to late stages in the M83 α-syn transgenic mouse line. The in vivo data
will be validated with ex vivo histology analysis and behavioral studies. Furthermore, we propose to establish more insights
on the cellular mechanisms involved in uptake and degradation of the biomarker using both murine and human cell lines."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective treatments, underscoring the
need for a better understanding of AD pathogenesis. Longitudinal studies in autosomal dominant and sporadic
AD have demonstrated that pathology begins 10-20 years before clinical symptoms, but developmental effects
of AD-associated genetic variants likely provide a substrate for future neuropathological changes. Many AD
causal GWAS variants are associated with genes involved in endolysosomal pathways in glia. However, how
these causal genes are affecting cellular mechanisms has to be further investigated to tackle the disease. One
of the important questions is whether these endolysosomal pathway genes converge on ideally one clear
phenotype that can be targeted for therapeutics. Among others, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most significant
risk for late-onset AD—homozygosity for the risk allele APOE ɛ4 (APOE 44) increases AD risk by more than 15-
fold. To comprehensively assess the effect of human APOE4 on human brain cell types, we characterized the
APOE4 genotype-phenotype relationship in four brain cell types: microglia, astrocytes, brain microvascular
endothelial cells and mixed cortical cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Global
transcriptome analyses and in vitro mechanism study reveal that human APOE 44 astrocytes sequester
cholesterol in lysosomes, leading to upregulated cholesterol biosynthesis despite elevated intracellular
cholesterol. Our data suggests that the APOE4-mediated lipid accumulation impairs multiple intracellular
trafficking pathways that converge on the lysosome. Therefore, we hypothesize that intracellular lipid
accumulation in APOE 44 astrocytes jams trafficking to the lysosome (Aim 1), which are controlled by upstream
regulators that can be identified by CRISPRi genetic screening (Aim 2). The APOE4-led endolysosomal defects
in vitro astrocytes can be exacerbated in vivo by excessive lipid challenge induced by neurodegeneration (Aim
3). To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will determine the mechanistic defects of lipid-mediated
endolysosomal trafficking in vitro human APOE 44 astrocytes in transcriptional and functional changes. The
identified phenotypes will be validated in AD post-mortem brain. In Aim 2, using CRISPRi screen on APOE 44
astrocytes, we will identify targets to reverse defected phagocytosis and intracellular lipid accumulation and
determine the mechanisms by CROP-seq. In Aim 3, we will investigate mechanistic endolysosomal defects in
vivo xenotransplanted astrocytes at baseline and during demyelination-associated lipid debris challenge and
further test if CRISPRi-targeted astrocytes exhibit rescued phenotypes in vivo. The goal of this project is to
assess the molecular mechanisms of APOE4-driven endolysosomal and autophagic defects in lipid trafficking
and identify regulatory targets that reverse the phenotype. Further, this proposed research project sets out to
uncover potential therapeutic drug targets to tackle APOE4-driven endolysosomal trafficking endophenotypes
found in APOE4 carrier AD patients."
11074273,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). A key cardiovascular
outcome is left ventricular remodeling in the form of concentric hypertrophy, fibrosis, and vascular remodeling.
This results in diastolic dysfunction and eventual heart failure. There are no specific therapies for this adverse
remodeling in T1D, therefore, progress in the prevention or regression of this condition requires identification of
new treatment approaches. In T1D and T2D there is a loss of the 11 amino acid sensory nerve neuropeptide
substance P (SP). Using an animal model of T2D, we identified that replacement of lost SP provides protection
against cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction via activation of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK-1R). We have
subsequently determined that many C-terminal metabolites of SP retain biological activity at the NK-1R, and
further determined that a mimetic of the SP metabolite SP7-11, which activates the NK-1R, prevents cardiac
fibrosis and restores normal cardiac function in T2D mice. Thus, SP and SP metabolites that activate the NK-1R
are cardioprotective in diabetes. Further, we have identified that the N-terminal SP metabolite SP1-9, does not
activate the NK-1R but instead is active at the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MrgprX2). This is
significant because MrgprX2 is found almost exclusively on mast cells and mast cells contribute to adverse
cardiac remodeling, particularly fibrosis. Thus, SP1-9 and MrgprX2 would be predicted to promote adverse
cardiac remodeling. Therefore, the current project will utilize fixed and frozen cardiac tissue, plasma, and fixed
and frozen coronary vessel tissue to assess SP metabolites, SP receptors, SP metabolizing enzymes, mast
cells, fibrosis, as well as available clinical parameters to determine the extent to which cardioprotective and
adverse cardiac remodeling-promoting molecules and cells are present in the T1D heart. These parameters will
be compared with T2D and non-diabetic hearts. We will also correlate: 1) the assessed parameters with
fibrosis/vascular remodeling as primary outcomes; 2) the assessed parameters with each other as secondary
outcomes; and 3) the assessed parameters with available clinical data as tertiary outcomes. Emphasis will be
placed on the association between SP and SP metabolites with the aforementioned outcomes. Our overall
hypothesis is that T1D results in low SP levels, cardiac and coronary vascular remodeling and reduced cardiac
function from either decreased neuronal SP production and less NK-1R activation or SP metabolism giving high
SP1-9 levels and activation of MrgprX2. We will test our hypothesis using three specific aims: 1) Determine SP,
SP metabolites and neuronal SP content in the T1D heart and plasma; 2) Determine SP metabolizing peptidases,
NK-1R, MrgprX2, MCs, fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the T1D heart; and 3) Determine the relationship
between SP metabolizing peptidases, NK-1R, MrgprX2 and MCs to fibrosis and vascular remodeling in the T1D
heart. These studies will provide new insights into the role of SP and SP metabolites in the human heart in T1D
and may indicate a new therapeutic approach for cardiac remodeling in T1D patients."

Myoclonic Atonic Epilepsy (MAE), a rare developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by
frequent severe seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability, has been linked to loss of function
variants in the SLC6A1 gene. The SLC6A1 gene encodes the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT-
1), the most abundant GABA transporter in the brain which is responsible for the reuptake of GABA at the
synapse. In humans and rodents, SLC6A1 DEE variants result in reduced GABA uptake and lead to
physiological, behavioral, cognitive, and developmental abnormalities including neural network hyperexcitability
and epilepsy. However, the mechanisms by which GAT-1 haploinsufficiency (HI) results in epilepsy remain
unclear. An in vitro human model of SLC6A1 HI is therefore critical to elucidate disease mechanisms and test
potential therapeutics. The objective of this project is to use our newly developed 2-D and 3-D human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived in vitro models of SLC6A1 HI to explore alterations in GABAergic
signaling, early cortical development and neuronal excitability. We hypothesize that SLC6A1 HI alters brain
development and GABAergic signaling leading to neuronal network hyperexcitability in MAE patients.
This hypothesis is based in part on our unexpected finding of severe interneuron migration defects in SLC6A1
heterozygous and homozygous CRISPR knockout and patient ganglionic eminence-like organoids. Novel
methods, including a new 3-D medial ganglionic eminence-like organoid model which I have developed and
transcription factor-induced GABAergic neurons (iGNs) derived from CRISPR gene edited iPSCs will be used
to test this hypothesis. I will assess neuronal morphology, gene and protein expression, neural progenitor
proliferation/differentiation/migration, interneuron maturation and GABAergic synaptogenesis to evaluate the
developmental consequences of SLC6A1 HI. Functional assays, including whole-cell patch-clamp recordings,
calcium imaging, multielectrode array recordings, and local field potential recordings, will be conducted to
examine electrophysiological activity at single-cell and network resolutions, while GAT-1 transport activity will
be measured using a tritiated GABA uptake assay. Based on our preliminary data and previous work, a 50% or
greater reduction in GAT1 expression and function is anticipated in patient and het/homozygous CRISPR
knockout lines, as well as delayed migration of SLC6A1 HI and knockout cells compared to controls. Deficits in
GABAergic neuron maturation, synaptogenesis, and network formation are also expected. The results of this
study will yield significant insight into SLC6A1-related DEE mechanisms and will provide the broader scientific
community with a platform to study a wide range of genetic epilepsies and to test future therapeutic targets.
The proposed experiments, mentoring team and training plan will provide me with the necessary growth and
development as a scientist to become a successful independent investigator."

Our long-term goal is to identify and understand the mechanisms underlying plasticity in visual
stimulus detection and visually-guided pursuit. Plasticity in these visuospatial orienting behaviors
are perturbed in both neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism as well as neurological
disorders resulting from traumatic experiences such as PTSD. Thus, development and plasticity
of these visual orienting behaviors critically impact healthy visual processing. In order to
ultimately develop targeted therapies that alleviate the specific visual processing deficits
associated with each disorder, it is necessary to first understand the mechanisms that underlie
the development and plasticity of visual stimulus detection and pursuit behaviors more
fundamentally. We will start to address this critical gap by investigating the development and
sensory experience-dependent plasticity of function of specific cell types of the superior colliculus
in the mouse as they relate to specific changes in visual stimulus detection and pursuit behavior.
The superior colliculus is a key subcortical visual system that processes salient environmental
stimuli, receives substantial input from cortex and mediates rapid spatial orienting behavior in all
mammals. The function of cells in this structure are sensitive to visual experience and change
significantly over development, and, two classes of cells in the superior colliculus known as the
wide- and narrow-field vertical neurons specifically underlie visual stimulus detection and pursuit.
However, we do not understand how these precise neural circuits are directly impacted by visual
experience throughout life. The mouse affords access to a broad range of sophisticatedgenetic
tools that may be used to close this gap in our understanding. In AIM 1, we will quantify stimulus
detection and pursuit behaviors at key developmental stages from postnatal day 21 to adulthood
to understand how these visual orienting behaviors change in the mouse. In AIM 2, we will
determine whether specific circuit changes support developmental changes in behavior by quantifying
the neural encoding of visual stimuli specifically in the wide- and narrow-field cell circuits of the
superior colliculus in the behaving animal. We will measure specific neural activity using high-
density in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, virus mediated circuit tracing, calcium imaging
and functional ultrasound imaging. In AIM 3, we will study the experience-dependent
development of both behavior and specific circuit function in the superior colliculus by
manipulating visual experience by allowing mice to hunt live insects (enrichment). Overall, this
work will advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying successful
spatial orienting behaviors that are essential for visual perception."

Throughout multiple species, variations in cognitive abilities can influence an individual’s ability to learn and
perform goal-directed behavioral tasks which is critical for their overall success, well-being, and survival. It is
unclear how individual differences in learning are influenced by genetic variation among neurotypical subjects.
Further, it is unclear how polygenic risk factors ultimately result in learning deficits among individuals diagnosed
with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (IDs). My research project aims to understand
the neurobiology of individual heritable differences. I will investigate how genetic variation alters gene expression
in specific cell types and neural circuit function in individual learning. For my Dissertation Research Project, I
have used large scale automated homecage training across different inbred mouse strains to establish that
learning traits are heritable. Using the genetically heterogeneous Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, I have identified
genes associated with learning. The expression of these genes converges onto cell types in the subicular
complex, implicating its role in learning differences. Using spatial transcriptomics and anatomical tracing, I will
determine how these identified genetic differences result in neuronal cell type properties and morphology in the
subicular complex across inbred strains with different learning capacities. By performing calcium imaging with
miniature microscopes during automated homecage task training, I will determine how neural activity in the
subicular complex differs across inbred strains with different learning capacities. For my Postdoctoral Research
Direction, I will leverage the skills acquired during my dissertation project to investigate how ASD and IDs arise
across different genetic backgrounds. To do this, I will learn how to perform multiplexed in vivo gene editing to
introduce multiple ASD/IDs risk factors into different mouse strains. I will learn multi-omic methods to assess
how these perturbations alter gene expression and their subsequent impact on neural circuit function and
behavior. Overall, this project will identify how genetic variation influences neural circuit properties to shape
learning in healthy and disease-associated individuals."

The goal of this FASEB meeting “Transcription, Chromatin and Epigenetics in Aging” is to cover innovative topics
in the roles epigenetic mechanisms play in the regulation of aging and how this is linked to disease states. In
this meeting we will cover both fundamental mechanisms as well as novel therapeutic strategies for age-related
diseases, introducing for the first time a metabolism session as well as three interdisciplinary and therapeutic-
related sessions. Epigenetic mechanisms encompass post-translational modifications of chromatin and RNA as
well as transcriptional regulation, which together define the transcriptional program of the cell. This FASEB
meeting will be unique in integrating the latest discoveries in epigenetics and their importance in aging as well
as ‘novel therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases. There is a vital need for such a meeting, particularly in
bringing in together scientists at the forefront of both fields, to discuss interdisciplinary approaches to address
key questions in both fields. Exciting recent studies have revealed how organismal and cellular aging can be
regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, and how this is link to the metabolic state of the cell and its
microenvironment. The field of epigenetic is rapidly expanding, and the aging field can benefit from the latest
discoveries and advances in technologies in this area. Conversely, challenges and questions about the role of
epigenetics in aging and age-related diseases abound, and it is critical for researchers in the chromatin and
transcription fields to better grasp the implications of their work for health and disease.
This FASEB meeting will discuss cutting-edge questions in field focusing on the key topic of the underlying
molecular mechanisms that govern epigenetic regulation in aging. The meeting will cover new frontiers, including
the exciting emerging field of RNA epigenomics and new interdisciplinary chemical-biology approaches to study
these. The meeting will particularly focus on transformative epigenomic technologies including the development
and utility of new chemical modalities to manipulate and eventually target these for therapeutics.
This meeting will foster exciting interactions between scientists addressing fundamental questions, developing
new methodologies and therapeutic modalities. The meeting will also provide a uniquely interactive, diverse, and
inclusive forum throughout the meeting through short talks, poster teasers and sessions and promoting several
networking and meet-the-expert events. To further enhance our support of the next generation of scientist, we
established for the first time a full day of FASEB-Junior section that is dedicated to career-development and
networking for trainees and new investigators. Bringing these young investigators at early stages of their career
will not only encourage them to work in this field but also foster long-term interdisciplinary collaborations in very
different areas that will be highly beneficial for both fields."
11070957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 1 in 3 American adolescents have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; 3 in 20 with a mood
disorder, with 1 in 3 female adolescents experiencing at least one major depressive episode. The onset of
psychiatric disorders can occur in early life, potentially leading to a reduced quality of life due to a disruption in
emotional, psychological, and/or social development. Mental illness during youth may also result in long-term
consequences, including an increased risk of mental health challenges and diminished quality of life in adulthood.
Inflammation in the central nervous system (neuroinflammation) is thought to underlie anxiety and mood
disorders, yet there remain no broadly effective therapies. The neuroinflammatory pathology may be, in part,
caused by circadian dysregulation of the neuroimmune system. The circadian clock is critical for controlling
biological processes, generating time-of-day differences in gene expression, hormone release, and behaviors;
however, circadian rhythms dampen in psychiatric disorders. Although the percentage of individuals experiencing
psychiatric disorders concomitant with circadian disturbances remains unknown, circadian disruptions and sleep-
wake disturbances are used as diagnosable criteria for neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, circadian
dysregulation may be a potential biomarker and signal for early intervention in anxiety- and mood disorder-
related pathology. The immune system is tightly regulated by the circadian clock, and recent evidence
demonstrates circadian regulation of neuroimmune system components: microglia, meninges, and choroid
plexus. Microglia, the primary immune cell of the brain, are rhythmic cells that can trigger a release of
inflammatory molecules when activated, potentially triggering a suite of physiological and behavioral alterations.
The meninges and choroid plexus serve as immune surveillance sites and can also release inflammatory signals
that influence the activity of microglia. Together, these components may provide insights into the pathogenesis
and pathophysiology of mental disorders. However, the ontogeny of circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune
system has not been well-documented. Early developmental periods offer a potential window for intervention
and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, we hypothesize that circadian rhythms in the neuroimmune
system emerge early in life, and perturbations during development will alter neuroimmune function that leads to
behavioral changes. This proposal addresses the following specific aims: First, establish the development of
circadian rhythms in “clock” and inflammatory genes in critical neuroimmune tissues; second, reveal whether
early life environmental and genetic perturbations to the circadian system lead to long-term behavioral changes.
This contribution will be significant because our results will identify temporal windows of high and low
neuroimmune reactivity during development. We expect these results will uniquely combine expertise in
circadian biology, immunology, and behavioral neuroscience to identify a novel role for biological rhythms in
regulating neuroinflammatory pathology and mood-related behaviors via the neuroimmune system."
11060522,"Project Summary: Intestinalization of the esophagus, termed Barrett’s esophagus (BE), is thought to develop
in response to chronic acid and bile reflux and carries great clinical significance because it is the precursor to
esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of BE is quite high, estimated to be found in at least 1:100
people. While relatively few with BE progress to cancer there is great importance to being able to detect and
treat those at risk of progression as EAC is an aggressive cancer with potential for early spread. Efforts to screen
for high-risk disease in those with BE have, to date, not been very successful. Therefore, there is profound need
to define the process by which BE progresses into EAC, to develop biomarkers to diagnose early progression
and assess progression risk in BE tissues as well as to develop novel therapies for treatment. The objective of
this diversity supplement proposal is to provide training to a promising URM researcher to prepare her for a PhD
program while providing a significant contribution to the parent R37 project. Specifically, this proposal will perform
enhanced methylation analysis utilizing a new sequencing based approach. Additionally, this proposal will
explore how this additional sequencing data may be used to improve our somatic DNA copy number analysis.
Combined, these studies will be a valuable component of our overall objective to develop a molecular risk
stratification assay for patients with Barrett’s esophagus. In addition to the expert group of researchers that has
been established as part of the parent R37 project, the candidate will be co-mentored with Dr. Franklin Huang.
Dr. Huang is an expert cancer computational biologist who has a laboratory near Dr. Stachler. This will allow the
candidate to receive strong mentorship and career development on the full spectrum of cancer genomics through
the aims listed below.
Aim 1: Identify and validate a set of methylation-based biomarkers that best risk stratify patients with a
diagnosis of non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus or low-grade dysplasia.
Aim 2: Adapt standard computational approaches of DNA copy number analysis to utilize sequencing
data generated from sequencing based methylation analysis.
A major goal of the supplement candidate is to expand her abilities in NGS based ‘omic’ analysis in both the
traditional wet lab, computational, and integrated analysis of the data generated in preparation for applying to
graduate school where she hopes to pursue further studies in cancer genomics. Therefore, the performing of
methylation analysis and developing methods to determine copy number calling from the sequencing data will
be an ideal platform for Lorena Benitez-Rivera to develop her expertise in cancer genomics."

Introduction. Acanthamoeba keratitis is a blinding corneal infection with few treatment options. Corticosteroids
are currently used by many cornea specialists for acanthamoeba keratitis, but their use is controversial given
their ability to promote acanthamoeba growth.
Trial Design. This proposed study is a randomized trial assessing whether topical corticosteroids improve
clinical and visual outcomes.
 • Inclusion. 200 patients with microbiologic evidence of acanthamoeba keratitis (i.e., on culture, smear,
 or polymerase chain reaction) from 11 centers in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and India
 will be eligible if there is evidence of ocular inflammation after 4 weeks of anti-amoebic therapy.
 • Pre-trial intervention. All participants will be treated with a standard of care anti-amoebic treatment,
 with the preferred treatment being polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) 0.02% eyedrops.
 • Trial intervention. After the fourth week of anti-amoebic treatment, if there is ocular inflammation (i.e.,
 corneal, episcleral, or anterior chamber inflammation) then participants will be offered enrollment and
 randomized to either topical prednisolone sodium phosphate 1% or placebo eyedrops. Participants will
 continue PHMB therapy while on the study medications.
 • Trial outcomes. The primary outcome is best corrected visual acuity with a hard contact lens,
 assessed at months 6 and 7. Secondary outcomes include (i) time to clinical resolution, (ii) time to
 perforation or therapeutic corneal transplantation, (iii) corneal thinning, (iv) eye pain, and (v) quality of
life.
Secondary objectives. Corneal swabs will be collected at the time of the initial diagnosis and processed with
metagenomic deep sequencing to determine if endosymbiotic bacteria living within the amoeba, or the
organism’s gene expression profile, is predictive of severe inflammation. Conjunctival swabs will be collected
prior to randomization to determine if the host gene expression profile is predictive of severe inflammation.
Impact. The trial will provide much-needed evidence using the highest-quality study design: a randomized
controlled trial. Moreover, this will be the largest prospective cohort of acanthamoeba keratitis to date, with
extensive microbiological, clinical, and imaging data from enrollment centers on 4 continents, which will allow
numerous secondary analyses. The study results will be directly useful for providers who treat acanthamoeba
keratitis as well as the patients currently affected by this blinding infection."

This equipment supplement request is to fund a new, high-throughput, low sample volume sonicator to
efficiently lyse cells and nuclei, while shearing genomic DNA, to propel projects within R35 GM147554.
O-GlcNAc is a single N-acetylglucosamine coupled to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and
cytoplasmic proteins. Analogous to phosphorylation, O-GlcNAc signaling is dynamic, rapidly added and
removed from proteins in a site-specific manner in response to cellular perturbations and extracellular
cues. Because both modifications occur on the same residues it is hypothesized that there is a
functional crosstalk between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation, where one may affect deposition or
removal the other. Unlike phosphorylation, however, which is catalyzed by over 500 kinases and
roughly 300 phosphatases, the mammalian genome only encodes a single O-GlcNAc transferase
(OGT) and a single hydrolase (OGA). While many kinases recognize specific amino acid sequences in
their substrates, the determinants guiding OGT are unclear and likely manifold. This intracellular
glycosylation is implicated in nearly every cellular process from gene expression and signal
transduction to cell division and differentiation. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this post-translational
modification in health and disease, the specific functions of OGT and the basic principles of O-GlcNAc
signaling remain almost entirely elusive. This gap in our knowledge has been largely due to the major
lack of tools and technologies available to study O-GlcNAc signaling or perturb the essential OGT.
Here, we aim to uncover the basic principles of OGT and O-GlcNAc signaling, and their role in
transcriptional regulation of cellular differentiation. We have recently developed a highly sensitive and
specific enrichment reagent to analyze O-GlcNAc-modified peptides from cells and tissues by mass
spectrometry. Using these new anti-O-GlcNAc antibodies we will elucidate the global, site-specific
temporal dynamics of O-GlcNAc signaling during the transition from totipotency to naïve and primed
pluripotency. Combined with phosphoprotemic profiling of the same samples, we will monitor for
crosstalk between these two post-translational modifications. To gain insight into how OGT targets its
diverse array of substrates, we will deconvolute the extensive OGT interactome employing biochemical
fractionation, followed by mass spectrometric analysis. To explore how OGT uses adaptor proteins to
targets substrates, we are degrading specific OGT interacting proteins and assessing changes in
downstream O-GlcNAc signaling using our new quantitative glycoproteomic approach. Integrating
these two research programs, we will create a holistic, high-resolution understanding of the principles
of O-GlcNAc signaling. The requested high-throughput/low volume sonicator will greatly enable the
new and ongoing directions and approaches we are employing to study O-GlcNAc biology."

Kidney transplantation is an area of scarcity with demand for transplantable kidneys for those on the waiting list
continuing to outstrip supply. Increasing living donation rates, where someone donates one kidney while alive
to someone whose own kidneys don’t function, is the most promising way to increase the number of kidneys
available for transplant. Growing obesity rates, however, threaten to curb this supply, as having a high body
mass index (BMI) may rule out a potential living donor from evaluation. There is considerable disagreement
about the use of BMI as a determinant of eligibility with practices varying across and between countries and
transplant centers. Some say that risks can be modified or are justified. Reducing risks to potential living
donors would entail engagement with weight loss interventions. Access to and success of weight loss
interventions are highly variable.
Given these complexities and the need to increase the supply of organs, key ethical questions around risk,
fairness, and equity need to be examined and addressed for the involvement and protection of obese living
donors. It is vital to establish appropriate health screening measures and accurate and effective risk
communication for obese living donors. Understanding whether weight loss is desirable, accessible, or
achievable for those wishing to donate is important to providing responsive support. Discussions of what we
owe those taking the significant steps of both losing weight and donating an organ at personal risk to help
another are critically needed.
By first understanding current practice (Aim 1) and how excluded donors feel about risk and justice issues
related to weight loss and living donation (Aim 2), we will combine empirical findings, clinical evidence, and
normative analysis to generate expert recommendations for the decision-making and equitable support of
obese potential living donors (Aim 3).This project will build bioethics capacity by producing empirically informed
recommendations and drafting tools that support equitable practice in living donation, an area of scarcity with
great clinical and ethical complexity."
11062183,"Project Summary
Aggression—acting with the intent to inflict harm—is a universal component of social behavior, and all too often
the grim subject of the daily news. One of the most reliable triggers of aggression is frustration, or failing to
achieve an expected reward. This state can be adaptive, energizing behaviors to overcome barriers. But it can
also lead to anger and violence. In disorders as disparate as PTSD, bipolar disorder, and autism, low frustration
tolerance and uncontrolled aggression are among the most prevalent and impairing symptoms in psychiatry. Yet
the neurobiology of these behaviors is poorly understood, and current treatment options are grossly inadequate.
This proposal aims to define the role of two neuromodulators—dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT)—in the
neural response to frustrating events. In Aim 1, the candidate will create a mouse model of frustration by
combining conditioning tasks with the resident-intruder assay, in which an intruder mouse is added to a resident’s
cage to elicit aggression. On test days, the conditioning task will end with an unexpectedly negative outcome,
eliciting greater aggression from the resident mouse. In Aim 2, the candidate will use fiber photometry and
optogenetics to record and manipulate DA neuron activity and DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) while
mice perform the frustration task. DA is a key modulator of motivated behaviors, and has long been considered
pro-aggressive. Few studies, however, have recorded DA during frustration or aggression. This experiment will
test whether DA release tonically increases with frustration, triggering aggression. In Aim 3, the candidate will
use fiber photometry and optogenetics to record and manipulate 5HT neuron activity and 5HT release in the NAc
during the frustration task. Unlike DA, 5HT is thought to inhibit behavior, including aggression. But 5HT neurons
have not been recorded during aggression. This Aim will test the hypothesis that 5HT release decreases with
frustration, and that larger decreases facilitate greater aggression.
The proposed studies would be among the first to examine the neural circuit mechanisms of frustration. In the
process, the candidate will supplement his background in electrophysiology in head-fixed animals to become
proficient in social behaviors and calcium imaging. He will work with an advisory committee comprising world
leaders in human (Dr. Emil Coccaro) and rodent (Dr. Klaus Miczek) aggression, frustration (Dr. Ellen Leibenluft),
and 5HT (Dr. Liqun Luo), in addition to his primary mentor Dr. Rob Malenka and his career development mentor
Dr. Alan Schatzberg. He will take full advantage of the intellectually vibrant environment at Stanford and
supplement his technical training with high-quality didactic and professional training via frequent mentor
interactions, targeted coursework, and other career and intellectual growth opportunities. By the end of the
fellowship, the candidate will be positioned to launch a career as an independent investigator leading a
translational research program on the neural basis of aggression and irritability."
11043038,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The first 24-months of human life are dynamic, characterized by rapid growth, and 
increasingly recognized as crucial for establishing cognitive abilities and behaviors that last a lifetime. However, 
little is known about trajectories of structural and functional brain development during this sensitive period in 
typically developing infants, and even less is known about how deviations in these trajectories relate to emerging 
cognition and behavior or predict later developmental outcomes. This is partially due to current technical 
limitations on quantification of brain structure and function in infants via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – an 
important, non-invasive approach to the study of developmental neuroscience. Currently there are insufficient 
methods to analyze infant MRI scans across the first 24 months of life, especially for brain segmentation – the 
first and critical step for virtually all quantitative analyses across MRI modalities. Without accurate and automated 
segmentation, infant MRI analysis is prone to systematic errors and is labor-intensive, limiting the rigor and 
reproducibility of infant MRI research. This limitation curtails and delays the utility of large-scale infant MRI 
datasets in the foreseeable future. Addressing these research gaps would significantly advance efforts toward 
early identification of developmental delays and/or disorders. This proposal aims to capitalize developed artificial 
intelligence methods and platform in the K99 phase by utilizing extensive infant MRI datasets from both the Baby 
Connectome Project (BCP) and the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), to delineate growth 
trajectories of brain structure/function and measure the relationship between those trajectories and 
neuropsychological functions (Aim 1), and then to predict the developmental outcomes (Aim 2). In Aim 1, I will 
delineate the growth trajectories of regional brain morphometrics, major functional networks, and measure their 
relationships to neuropsychological functions during the first 24months of life via data from BCP. In Aim 2, I will 
leverage two different approaches (AI and LPCA) to predict the developmental outcomes assessed up to 3 years 
old with the first-year longitudinal multimodal MRI scans from BCP. We will also validate our AI model with 
multimodal MRI scans from dHCP, an independent dataset. The successful execution of this project is expected 
to employ innovative data-driven methods to investigate the nuances of early brain development, filling critical 
knowledge gaps of early development, and advancing efforts toward early identification of developmental delays."

Menthol, cooling/ice, and tobacco flavors are among the most abundant for Electronic Nicotine Delivery 
Systems (ENDS) or electronic cigarettes. These flavors are not regulated due to the potential public health 
benefit cessation of combustible tobacco use. However, the toxicological effects of vaping these products 
are not entirely understood. Further, increased use of cooling/ice/menthol-like products is correlated with 
higher e-cig consumption due to their cooling and antitussive properties. However, the modified risk and 
toxicity of these products are poorly understood. The K99 /R00 proposal aimed at identifying the chemical 
agents (flavoring chemicals) that cause lung toxicity using cell culture and mouse models. As the K99 
phase provided biologically significant data from acute exposures, we will continue the same aims as below 
with a modified R00 plan mainly focusing on sub-chronic (in vitro) and chronic (in vivo) exposures 
mentioned in Aims 2 and 3. The R00 phase will focus on validating the toxicants identified in the aerosols 
and relating them to the biological response and biomarkers. Moreover, these findings will be validating 
during prolonged exposures to flavored ENDS and chemical agents. This study hypothesizes that 
menthol/cooling flavors and tobacco flavors contain harmful chemicals that induce adverse cellular and 
biological responses and chemically interact upon aerosolization, causing augmented toxicity with preexisting respiratory conditions. Aim 1: Identify the chemistry of menthol, menthol-like (cooling), and tobacco 
flavors, including flavoring chemicals and secondary products formed upon aerosolization. Aim 2: 
Determine in vitro and in vivo toxicity and health effects of menthol, menthol-like (cooling), and tobaccoflavored ENDS in EpiAirway 3D tissues and mice (C57BL/6J and BALB/C) under normal and pre-existing 
respiratory conditions. Aim 3: Determine in vitro and in vivo toxicity and health effects of menthol, menthollike (cooling), and tobacco flavoring chemicals in EpiAirway 3D tissues and mice (C57BL/6J and BALB/C) 
under normal and pre-existing respiratory conditions. In R00 phase, effects in lung after sub chronic 
and chronic exposure to CS and then switching over to ENDS (menthol, cooling, and tobacco) will 
also be determined, allowing to assess the benefit or the modified toxicity of switching from CS to ENDS. 
This will further be studied in normal, asthma, and COPD, 3D tissues (sub chronic) and mice with the same 
phenotypes. Thus, Dr. Muthumalage, in his R00 proposes to perform a comparative toxicity, and 
biomarkers of disease under normal and pre-existing respiratory disease conditions providing information 
necessary for regulation of harmful constituents in these products."

SCS+CARSS to COSMIIC Adapter Lead
 The goal of this Supplement is to create implantable adapter leads that can connect
between the COSMIIC-style connector and standard spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads. This
allows users of the COSMIIC System to be able to take advantage of the many different SCS-style
leads available in the medical device industry. In addition, we will create an adapter than can
connect to the CARSS electrode. The CARSS electrode utilizes the standard SCS contacts, and
thus the COSMIIC-CARSS Adapter is effectively a subset of the COSMIIC-SCS Adapter.
 The COSMIIC-SCS Adapter will be designed and fabricated in collaboration with Ardiem
Medical (part of the COSMIIC Beekeeper Team). Prototype adapter and leads will be tested in a
saline bath test station to evaluate current leakage from the adapter. Key project tasks include:
1. Design and fabrication of prototype Y-branch connector utilizing COSMIIC System network
 cable lead (drawn-filled tube).
2. Concept development of 8-conductor lead compared to existing 4-conductor lead (flexibility)
 – select 8-conductor or 2 x 4-conductor lead combination
3. Design and fabricate prototype Tri-Y-branch connector utilizing COSMIIC System network
 cable lead with 8 total conductors.
4. Design and fabricate prototype “spade-style” connector for MPS device. Compare insertion-
 removal forces with standard single-port connector.
5. Design and fabricate prototype 4 and 8 contact port adapter.
6. Evaluate feasibility of single port adapter design that can accommodate either 4 or 8 contacts
 (same adapter can be utilized for SCS leads, DBS leads, and CARSS-style leads)."
11073518,"Abstract. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a polygenetic disease marked by impaired insulin secretion in pancreatic
islet cells. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many T2D-associated genetic
variants/genes, understanding the molecular mechanism and cellular consequence of GWAS identified hits
remains challenging. In addition, little is known about the interaction network of GWAS identified T2D
genes/variants. Recent advances in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and CRISPR-based technologies
have enabled in vitro model systems for exploring the impact of T2D-associated genes and genetic network on
islet dysfunction.
In our recent study, we generated a panel of individual isogenic KO hESCs across 20 T2D effector genes. We
systematically evaluated the impact of each KO on β cell differentiation efficiency, insulin production and
secretion, and β cell survival. We performed allelic imbalance analysis and prioritized 18 T2D associated SNPs,
two of which are located at RFX binding motifs. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis of human islets revealed the
decreased expression of RFX3 and RFX6 in T2D islets. Finally, qRT-PCR analysis showed decrease expression
of RFX3 and RFX6 in seven T2D-KO hESC-derived INS-GFP+ β-like cells. Here, we propose to use isogenic
hPSC-derived islet organoids and human islets to systematically evaluate the molecular cascade involving T2D
effector genes-RFX3/6-T2D variants in human islet cell generation, survival, and function under both healthy and
T2D conditions. Three aims were proposed. In Aim 1, we will establish inducible KD hESC lines to assess the
individual and synergistic effects of RFX3/6 on human islet cell generation, function, and survival. In Aim 2, we
will decode the T2D effector genes-RFX3/6 signaling cascade in human islet cell damage in T2D conditions. In
Aim 3, we will decipher the RFX3/6-T2D variants signaling cascade.
This proposal aims to systematically evaluate the molecular cascade involving T2D effect genes-RFX3/6-T2D
variants in human islet cell, generation, survival, and function. This study will establish a comprehensive pipeline
for defining the biological function of T2D effector genes, prioritizing and validating the T2D variants, finally
mapping the interactive network of T2D associated genes/variants in disease relevant tissues. This will not only
address several challenges encountered in current T2D GWAS studies, but also shedding light on new insights
into T2D disease progression."

Parent Award: MRI guidance of cardiac catheterization provides a non-ionizing
alternative to X-ray fluoroscopy and can improve soft tissue contrast. Recent advances have
increased the availability of MRI-safe devices, but clinical use remains limited due to the
relatively poor image quality of single-shot, real-time MRI. In this research, we propose to
develop a novel, multi-beat data acquisition and image analysis approach to improve
anatomic image quality and device visualization, which we test in silico, in vitro, and in
vivo.
 Supplement: This supplement extends the multi-beat approach being developed in the
parent award by incorporating inline assessment of image quality to the framework and supports
the training and development of a bioengineering graduate student (who is also part of the
physician-scientist MD/PhD training program). Early work by the applicant has demonstrated
that we can quickly score image quality with respect to number of k-space samples available for
image reconstruction and the presence of cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts. However, we
have yet to combine this finding with the multi-beat approach described in the parent award.
Therefore, in this supplement, we propose to validate our image quality scoring, incorporate
image quality metrics into our multi-beat imaging, and test the utility in patients. The use of
image quality as a metric for closed-loop control is expected to make our multi-beat imaging
more robust and more adaptive to patient-specific differences and changes over time.
 In addition to this new research direction, the supplement outlines tailored training for a
promising MD/PhD student who is joining the principal investigators laboratory. Together, they
have developed a set of training activities which will enable him to thrive at the interface of
cardiology, radiology, and bioengineering. The ongoing collaboration with pediatric cardiologists
developed by the parent award is the perfect setting for him to develop an interdisciplinary
training. He will have the ability to shadow clinical care of patients and take part in
multidisciplinary patient discussions. In addition, support for his scientific publishing and
conference presentations will provide him with the networking, publication, and training
experiences he needs to continue to work in this translational field."

Dyneins are AAA+ motors responsible for minus-end-directed motility along microtubules (MTs) and play
fundamental roles in cargo transport, mitosis, and ciliary beating. Dynein is currently the focus of the motor field
as the mechanism of its movement is not well understood in comparison to plus-end-directed kinesins. Despite
rapid transport of dynein-driven cargos in cells, previous in vitro studies identified mammalian dynein as a weak
motor, exhibiting slow motility and producing lower forces than kinesin. Recently, in vitro reconstitution of the
dynein-dynactin machinery revealed that mammalian dynein is autoinhibited when not transporting cargo, and
motility is activated when dynein forms a 2.5 MDa ternary complex with its cofactor dynactin and a cargo binding
adaptor. Therefore, all of the previous in vitro work on mammalian dynein used inactive motor and their
conclusions do not reflect how active dynein-dynactin machinery transports cargos in cells.
Our future goals are to dissect the mechanism of active cytoplasmic dynein complexes and determine how
dynein activation and motility are regulated across multiple scales using single molecule imaging, optical
trapping, MD simulations, and cryoEM. Specifically, we will determine how Lis1 plays a role in the activation of
and regulation of dynein motility. We will also study dynein motility in physiologically relevant conditions and ask
whether MT-associated proteins, MAP7 and Tau, inhibit dynein motility by sterically blocking its tubulin binding
site or by excluding its MT binding via liquid-liquid demixing. We will also characterize the motility of dynein and
dynactin disease mutants to reveal the molecular mechanism of neuropathies associated with these mutations.
Finally, we will reconstitute the entire MT transport machinery using cargo adaptors identified by in vivo studies
of mitochondria, autophagosomes, and vesicle transport, but not yet characterized in vitro. Using this approach,
we will dissect how cargo adaptors regulate motors to control the bidirectional transport of these cargos.
We will also study ciliary dyneins that slide parallel array of axonemal MTs to power ciliary beating. Several
models have been proposed to explain how the sliding activity of dyneins is self-regulated to orchestrate ciliary
oscillations. Predictions that these models make about the mechanism of ciliary dyneins have not been directly
tested. Recently, a recombinant expression system was developed for Tetrahymena outer-arm dynein (OAD),
enabling us to perform in-depth structural and biophysical studies of ciliary dyneins. Unlike cytoplasmic dynein,
OAD forms a heterodimer and is not processive. Using this system, we will characterize the mechanism of OAD
motility and force generation. We will then directly test the predictions of each model by constructing in vitro
geometries that mimic dynein/MT interactions in a beating cilium. Finally, we will identify structural components
that give rise to the nonprocessive motility, curvature sensing, and self-oscillatory behavior of OAD.
The success of our research program will reveal the fundamental mechanochemistry of dynein and how it
achieves retrograde transport of intracellular cargos and drives the self-coordinated oscillations of motile cilia."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), driven
by complex pathophysiological dysfunctions that remain poorly understood at the cellular and molecular level.
Epicardial fat accumulation and dysfunction have recently emerged as significant contributors to coronary artery
disease (CAD) in T1D, potentially by inducing coronary artery endothelial dysfunction through pro-inflammatory
adipocytokine secretion. This project utilizes the CARE-T1D consortium tissue bank to investigate the cellular
and molecular dysfunctions in epicardial fat and coronary vasculature in T1D. Specifically, we hypothesize that
T1D induces dysfunction in epicardial adipocytes, causing the release of inflammatory adipocytokines that traffic
to coronary endothelial cells disrupting their function. We propose to:
1) Comprehensively identify T1D-specific cell states and regulators in epicardial fat and coronary arteries by
performing single cell epigenetic and RNA profiling on CARE-T1D flash-frozen samples.
2) Genetically program “induced” T1D adipocytes in vitro to functionally characterize diabetes-specific adipocyte
cellular responses and identify dysregulated adipocytokines.
3) Integrate CARE-T1D coronary vascular profiles with functional genomic perturbations in endothelial cells to
define molecular mechanisms of T1D-specific endothelial dysfunction and test identified adipocytokines on
endothelial functions such as angiogenesis, adhesion and migration.
This research promises to elucidate the cellular mechanisms of CVD in T1D, offering insights into novel
therapeutic targets and a genomic atlas of single cell resolution data for future investigation."

Summary
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (The National Academies)
offers a variety of activities that address science policy issues and furnish credible, independent
advice in a neutral setting. One such activity is the Forum, also called a Roundtable, which is a
convening activity that provides both a mechanism and a venue for interested parties from
government, academia, industry, and other groups to meet and discuss issues of mutual interest
and concern in a neutral setting.
The primary purpose of Forums is to foster dialogue across sectors and among interested parties
and institutions, and to illuminate issues, but not necessarily to resolve them. A Forum will
explore a particular process, identify challenges that exist throughout, and discuss and promote
approaches to address those challenges. Specific Forum activities include structured discussions
(sometimes in closed session since Forums are not subject to FACA), workshops, and symposia.
The goal of these activities is to develop a mutual understanding of the relevant issues and to
provide a mechanism that fosters collaboration among parties in addressing these issues.
The Forum on Regenerative Medicine provides a convening mechanism for leaders from
academia, industry, government, patient and provider organizations, regulators, foundations,
associations, and others to come together to discuss and address issues of mutual interest and
concern. The purpose of the Forum is to explore and identify strategies for progressing the field
of regenerative medicine and advancing the discovery, development, and translation of
regenerative medicine findings into effective therapies. The Forum explores existing and
potential barriers to scientific and therapeutic advances; discusses opportunities to assist in
facilitating more effective partnerships among key parties; examines the impact that current
policies have on the discovery, development, and translation of regenerative medicine therapies;
considers the unique challenges of identifying, validating, and bringing regenerative medicine
applications to market; and explores the ethical, legal, and social issues posed by regenerative
medicine advances.
During the course of Forum discussions the need for more in-depth and detailed discussions on
specific topics is likely to emerge. In order to appropriately address these topics, the Forum may
conduct activities each year, such as workshops, agreed to by the Forum membership. In
selecting topics, the Forum considers the timeliness of the issues, the amount of information
already available on the topic, and whether or not the Forum members would benefit from
further exploration of the issues with outside experts."

Despite advances in treatment, sarcomas like rhabdoid tumors and desmoplastic small round cell tumors
(DSRCT) remain challenging, with frequent therapy resistance and fatal outcomes. The rarity of these cancers
(<1 case per 1,000,000 people per year for each type) and the limitations of current genomics and proteomics
methods underscore a critical need for innovative approaches to discover improved targets for therapy. Our
project aims to propel the study of ultra-rare cancers by integrating cutting-edge genomic and proteomic
technologies to uncover tumor-specific biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets, as envisioned by the
FDA Oncology Center of Excellence. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the fundamental biological processes
and molecular mechanisms driving cancer pathogenesis, specifically for rare cancers such as rhabdoid and
DSRCT tumors. By defining their tumor-specific proteomes, we seek to enable the discovery of specific
therapeutic targets to improve the survival rates of children and adults facing these refractory cancers.
Leveraging a unique MSK cohort of over 80,000 diverse patients with active disease, including those with
rhabdoid and DSRCT tumors, we propose a synthetic integration of long-read sequencing of bulk DNA, bulk
RNA and single cell RNA, and high-resolution multidimensional mass spectrometry proteomics. This approach
will enable us to construct comprehensive maps of tumor-specific cell surface proteomes, revealing
neomorphic gene products and non-canonical protein isoforms. In Aim 1, we will delineate tumor-specific
neomorphic and non-canonical cell-surface gene transcripts through the combined use of integrative long-read
and single-cell sequencing. Aim 2 will define the expression of neomorphic cell surface proteins directly using
integrative mass spectrometry proteogenomic approaches, focusing on non-canonical proteoforms and their
tumor-specific post-translational modifications. This approach includes rigorous technical validation measures
and aims to contribute to the NIH Cancer Data Science Initiative’s vision for an open data cancer ecosystem.
By addressing the critical gap in current cancer research methodologies and focusing on rare rhabdoid and
DSRCT tumors, this project stands to make a significant impact on the understanding and treatment of
ultra-rare cancers, paving the way for the development of targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes."

 Predicting the impact of genomic variation requires quantitative modeling to deconstruct the interplay
between multiple individual variants and to determine their combined effects on gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) that control cell state and cell function. We focus on the GRNs that control early human development
as a paradigm. Arguably the most important lineage decision during mammalian development is the decision of
epiblast cells to exit the pluripotent state (a state when the cells have the potential to give rise to all somatic
cells and germ cells), and differentiate into one of the three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm,
and ectoderm. This pluripotent state and the trilineage differentiation can be captured using cultured human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Much attention has focused on the GRNs underlying the maintenance of the
self-renewing pluripotent state, but the GRNs governing hESC trilineage differentiation remain largely
unexplored. We previously conducted genome-scale CRISPR/Cas screens to discover protein-coding genes
that regulate the transition of hESCs to definitive endoderm. Based on the genomic and genetic data and
machine learning (gkm-SVM sequence analysis), we expanded our initial simple two transcription factor (TF)
model to a multiple TF cooperative model. Here we propose an integrative approach examining the hESC
transition to definitive endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm germ layer identities to improve the
generalizability of GRN models. We will perform quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high
temporal and single-cell resolution. These quantitative measurements will be combined with perturbation of key
GRN elements, core TFs and their target enhancers, to inform the generation of dynamic GRN models. To
further improve the precision of our new GRN models, we will map cell trajectories during state transitions
through lineage tracing combined with scRNA-seq. Beyond hESC guided differentiation, the physiological
relevance of enhancers will be further interrogated in human and mouse organoids (gastruloids) and mouse
embryos. We will then apply innovative new computational and algorithmic methods to our multimodal
experimental data to generate GRN models, aiming to learn generalizable principles underlying the
contribution of genomic variants to cellular and ultimately organismal phenotypes. Developing GRN models for
the exit of pluripotency and the acquisition of germ layer identities involves dynamic modeling of the cell state
transition, which will not only inform our understanding of early human development, but can also serve as the
basis for construction of generalizable GRN models for biological transitions during embryonic development,
adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration as well as inappropriate cell fate transitions that occur in
pathological conditions such as cancer."

The processing and categorization of complex sounds is a skill critical to interacting with one’s environment for
many animals, the disruption of which can negatively affect quality of life for individuals suffering from auditory
processing disorders. Despite this importance, the processing and categorization of complex auditory stimuli
have yet to be fully understood. Existing work largely investigates the encoding of pure tone stimuli, which are
scarce in nature and not behaviorally relevant for most animals. Moreover, few studies have attempted to
prove causal relationships between neural activity correlated with stimulus presentation, and perception of a
given sound. Some such studies have shown improvements in behavior following optogenetic activation
strategies that stimulate broad subfields of auditory cortex; however, these strategies have been too spatially
coarse to interrogate the precise circuitry underlying encoding of stimuli. In this project we thus propose to
investigate the neural circuitry involved in categorization of auditory stimuli in mice performing a two-alternative
forced choice (2AFC) discrimination task, at three different levels along the auditory cortical pathway. We will
examine auditory cortical population dynamics first during categorization of unfamiliar pure tones (intermediate
between trained categories), identifying networks using Granger causality analysis and probing causality using
holographic stimulation. Given the importance of stimulus identity in 2AFC tasks, we expect to identify GC
subnetworks that show an overrepresentation of cells tuned to the frequencies of trained stimuli, and expect
that stimulation of strongly linked cells during presentation of intermediate stimuli will bias behavioral response
towards the category associated with activity of those cells. We will subsequently examine network dynamics
during presentation of more behaviorally relevant harmonic stimuli. Although harmonic structure has been
shown to be necessary for perception of vocalizations by mice, the processing of periodicity by the mouse
auditory system remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that primary auditory cortex (A1) layer 4 (L4) cells
tuned to the components of harmonics carry stimulus information to harmonicity-sensitive cells in layer 2/3,
which in turn is passed to cells sensitive to category membership as well as to periodicity-sensitive cells in
secondary auditory cortex. We expect this work to lead to a more complete picture of the processing of
harmonic sounds along the cortical hierarchy, as well as shed light on the neural encoding of categories
through examination of the causal relationship between ensemble activity and behavior."

More than 10 million youth in the United States live in poverty and experience structural inequality.
Experiences organized by structural inequality (e.g. adversity, income) are well known to confer risk for
adverse mental health outcomes in part by shaping neural structure and function. At the same time, brain
development is highly plastic and shifts to meet the needs of the environment. Despite emerging research
finding behavioral and neural differences between adversity and non-adversity exposed youth – differences
that reflect adaptive developmental processes – few research studies have explored the processes that
develop to support youth in navigating environments characterized by inequality. For individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds (as a result of structural inequality), cognitive processes are likely to be shifted
towards meeting the environmental challenge of obtaining material resources needed for day-to-day survival.
One way in which individuals impacted by structural inequality achieve this is through forming, utilizing, and
maintaining social relationships. Social relationships provide a range of resources, including social capital and
social support. Underlying the maintenance of supportive social relationships is mentalizing– the ability to
understand and take the perspectives of others’ thoughts and emotions. Based on available evidence, we
hypothesize that increased engagement in mentalizing serves as a protective factor against psychopathology
for adolescents who experience structural inequality. The proposed project will leverage a multi-modal
longitudinal study to examine the impacts of structural inequality on mentalizing, cognitive empathy, and
associated neural correlates that may support the acquisition of social support and promote positive mental
health outcomes. Three aims guide this research: (1) exploring how structural inequality impacts mentalizing,
associated neural networks, and cognitive empathy, (2) examining how mentalizing supports the maintenance
of social support, and (3) evaluating mentalizing and cognitive empathy as an underlying protective mechanism
against psychopathology among youth who experience structural inequality. These aims will be addressed by
leveraging a large study of adolescent youth (expected n = 275) who will participate in a passive neuroimaging
task and complete behavioral and self-report measures. Resources that will support this research include
access to this longitudinal sample, multiple research facilities, and a strong mentorship team with expertise in
developmental neuroscience, resilience, and structural inequality. The proposed research will enrich theories
regarding how neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by the environmental experience and identify
protective factors that can be leveraged to inform mental health treatments."
11057400,"Tobacco smoking, opioid use disorder, and chronic pain are highly comorbid conditions, and
smoking cessation in this population is extremely difficult to achieve. Co-administration of
nicotine and opioids results in mutual enhancement of positive reinforcement, which is likely to
contribute to persistent smoking in the context of opioid agonist therapy, such as office-based
buprenorphine treatment (OBBT). Moreover, nicotine has been shown to provide mild, short-
term anti-nociceptive effects, which may contribute to powerful negative reinforcement in
individuals with chronic pain. The goal of the proposed research is to examine whether
switching to very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes can directly weaken these positive and
negative reinforcement cycles to improve cessation outcomes among people who smoke (PWS)
receiving OBBT with non-cancer chronic pain. The research will employ a randomized between-
subjects design to evaluate the effects of smoking VLNCs versus normal nicotine content (NNC)
cigarettes on smoking behavior, pain, craving and withdrawal symptoms, and motivation to quit
smoking. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be used to examine changes in
bidirectional associations between pain, timing of buprenorphine dose, and smoking urge and
behavior as a function of cigarette condition. Participants will complete 1-week of baseline EMA
while smoking their usual brand of cigarettes; they will then be randomized to 4-weeks of NNCs
or VLNCs. EMA will continue during weeks 1 and 4 of study cigarette use. Participants will
attend weekly in-person visits to obtain biomarker verification of cigarette compliance and
complete self-report measures. At baseline and at the end of 4-weeks of study cigarette use, a
24-hr smoking abstinence test will be used to assess withdrawal symptoms, pain intensity and
sensitivity, and demand for usual brand cigarettes. At the conclusion of study cigarette use,
participants will engage in qualitative interviews about their experiences to guide treatment
development, and they will be provided with nicotine lozenges to support cessation. In general,
we hypothesize that switching to VLNCs will attenuate the bidirectional associations between
smoking, pain, and timing of buprenorphine administration as assessed via EMA, and will lead
to decreased symptoms of withdrawal and pain during the 24-hour abstinence test. We also
hypothesize that VLNCs will be associated with increased willingness to make a quit attempt,
and greater duration of achieved abstinence. These results will provide critical insights into the
role of nicotine in maintaining smoking/pain/opioid associations and the potential for VLNCs to
extinguish learned associations to promote smoking cessation in this vulnerable population."
11057928,"Nearly 1 in 2 Hispanic adult suicide deaths involves a firearm, the most lethal suicide method. However,
there are critical gaps in characterizing Hispanic firearm suicide deaths and identifying opportunities for
preventing firearm suicide among Hispanic adults. Our objectives are to leverage the power of machine
learning (ML) to identify circumstances preceding firearm suicides among Hispanic adults and generate new
information on the typology of Hispanic adult firearm suicide decedents. We propose to achieve these
objectives through the following Specific Aims: (1) Develop a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to
identify and code circumstances preceding firearm suicide deaths among Hispanic adults and (2) Establish
mutually-exclusive clinical typologies of Hispanic adult firearm suicide decedents with distinct combinations of
demographic characteristics and circumstances preceding death. This project will ultimately provide critical
information that will be used to inform targeted intervention and evaluation opportunities through a future R01,
such as implementing lethal means counseling, advising when and for which patients the intervention should
be provided.
 The proposed research is significant for two reasons. First, this project will fill a critical need for
identifying key circumstances preceding highly-lethal firearm suicide deaths among Hispanic adults. Since the
circumstances preceding firearm suicide death can differ by race/ethnicity, we will use NIMHD’s Health
Disparities Research Framework to organize how we categorize the circumstances at the individual level.
Second, this project will generate mutually-exclusive clinical typologies of Hispanic adult firearm suicide
decedents, including insights into the distinct demographic characteristics and circumstances experienced by
different subgroups of Hispanic adult firearm suicide decedents.
 The proposed research is innovative for three reasons. First, this will be among the first studies to
leverage free-text information abstracted from coroner/medical examiner (CME) and law enforcement (LE)
reports to generate much-needed information on the circumstances preceding Hispanic firearm suicides.
Second, this will be the first project to leverage the power of NLP and ML with free-text CME and LE data to
predict common circumstances preceding firearm suicide death among Hispanics quickly and accurately while
also creating standalone, annotated NLP tools for other users and applications. Third, this will be the first study
funded to establish distinct subgroups of Hispanic firearm suicide decedents and their unique combinations of
demographic and circumstance characteristics."

This project responds directly to PAR-21-038; the PI changes direction from valvular heart disease to study acute kidney injury (AKI). Indeed, the PI is a new faculty member in the Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine. The PI will apply her previous expertise in platelet structure to examine a new therapeutic approach to deliver mitochondria to injured kidneys and therefore stop the progression of AKI to end-stage renal disease. The PI is working closely with Dr. Daehn, an expert in kidney disease and mitochondrial function. In addition, she will be collaborating with Dr. Brestoff, an expert in mitochondria transplantation, to validate the proposed experimental approach. AKI is a critical health condition characterized by a sudden decline in kidney function. It occurs in approximately 20%-30% of hospitalized patients. In the US, AKI is leading to high morbidity and mortality. Although AKI encompasses various etiologies, tubular injury is an early and decisive step in AKI. During hypoxia, proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) undergo oxidant stress, mitochondrial damage, protein synthesis inhibition, and growth arrest. Non-treated AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease. Renal replacement therapy is necessary for patients with a survival of only 10%. Currently, there are no pharmacological or preventive strategies available to reverse or reduce the occurrence of severe AKI or to stop its progression to chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic strategies in this area. The central hypothesis in this application will test an innovative approach to treating kidneys using mitochondria transplants to prevent AKI. This hypothesis will be tested in one Specific Aim; To examine a new delivery approach of competent mitochondria to isolated proximal tubular epithelial cells using naked mitochondria or encapsulated mitochondria."

focuses on solid tumors and genetic instability through development of novel fluorescent `ChReporters'. These
enable us to image and track the first induction of chromosome loss and propagation into colonies. This is
expected to decrease the levels of Tumor Suppressors (e.g. p53, PTEN, APC, etc.), which is understudied in
these contexts and is the focus of our efforts. The Haynes lab brings deep expertise in epigenetics including
regulation of Tumor Suppressor genes, which are a major challenge in cancer, because loss of these key factors
is a major modern challenge to rescue (and lagging behind successes in inhibition of Oncogenes). Solid tumors
exhibit more chromosome losses and gains than liquid tumors, and clinical efforts with epigenetic drugs that
possibly rescue Tumor Suppressor levels to some extent are showing better efficacy in Liquid tumors. All of this
motivates our studies of chromosome loss using our ChReporters in Solid Tumor models to address how such
drugs as well as molecularly specific CRISPR approaches affect Tumor Suppressor levels and cancer-related

The goals of Scientific Project Two are the manufacturing and release of two cGMP saRNA/NLC HIV-1 Env-derived vaccine candidates and the establishment of an ICH-compliant stability program for these vaccines. The two vaccines consist of a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) encoding two HIV-1 Env immunogens (426c.Mod.Core and HxB2.WT.Core). The vaccines will be producing either the secreted nanoparticle form or the membrane-anchored forms of these two HIV-1 Env immunogens, depending on the findings made in Scientific Project One. The vaccines will be formulated with a nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC), which stabilizes the RNA and delivers it to cells that amplify it and express the antigen in vivo. The bulk drug substance (BDS) RNA is formulated with excipients, complexed with NLC BDS, sterile-filtered, and vialed to produce the final drug products (DP), which are the vaccine candidates. AAHI’s GMP Operations has experience with manufacturing and releasing saRNA and NLC BDS, and DPs or investigational Yellow Fever and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To date, AAHI GMP has manufactured four saRNA BDS, four NLC BDS, and two final drug products using our established processes. We are perfectly positioned to manufacture the HIV-1 Env immunogens discussed in this application within the period of funding."
11062803,"Abstract (from Parent Grant)
Ca2+ signaling is a broadly conserved regulator of cell function, thus many viruses have evolved mechanisms to
exploit Ca2+ signaling pathways to promote viral replication. Rotavirus (RV), which remains the leading cause of
acute gastroenteritis and diarrheal deaths in children worldwide, is an archetypal example of this. RV infection
induces global increases in cytosolic Ca2+ which both disrupts host cell physiology and facilitates RV replication.
While global Ca2+ dysregulation has long been a hallmark of RV infection, the distinct types of signals that sustain
this dysregulation, and thereby facilitate replication and pathogenesis, have not been fully identified. Recently,
our lab resolved a novel RV-induced Ca2+ signal known as an intercellular Ca2+ wave (ICW), which is critically
linked to both viral exploitation and host restitution. ICWs are mediated by paracrine ADP release from infected
cells which binds to the P2Y1 receptor on neighboring cells, eliciting a cytosolic Ca2+ flux. Through this
mechanism, RV dysregulates Ca2+ not only in infected cells, but also in neighboring, uninfected cells. We found
that this P2Y1-mediated signal is critical to host responses that influence disease, including serotonin, chloride,
and fluid secretion, and the expression of immune mediators. In preliminary studies, we have also found that
ICWs enhance MAPK activation and stem cell markers, which contribute to restitution. However, inhibiting ICWs
reduces RV shedding, suggesting that ICWs also facilitate RV replication. Importantly, our preliminary data also
show that recombinant expression of RV non-structural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum localized
viral Ca2+ channel, is sufficient to induce ICWs. Given this, our Central Hypothesis is that aberrant Ca2+
signaling caused by RV NSP4 initiates ADP release triggering paracrine activation of P2Y1 to regulate
host epithelial responses to RV infection; however, RV exploits this P2Y1 signaling to prime surrounding
cells for greater replication. To test this hypothesis, we will (Aim 1) characterize the RV-induced ADP release
pathway from infected cells, (Aim 2) characterize the P2Y1-mediated proliferative and restitution responses to
RV infection in the gut, and (Aim 3) determine how RV co-opts P2Y1 signaling to increase virus replication and
spread. Given that a broad range of enteric pathogens disrupt Ca2+ signaling, completion of these aims will
generate new mechanistic insights into the host/pathogen arms race, new understanding of pathogen recognition
pathways, and identify new cellular targets for potentially broadly acting antiviral therapies."
11056615,"SUMMARY
The high prevalence of pediatric obesity requires new anti-obesity agents with increased efficacy, safety, and
tolerance. Recent treatments based on endogenous gut peptides such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective at inducing weight loss through a suppression of food intake, but they are
often associated with nausea/malaise and gastrointestinal ailments, leading to poor compliance with, or
discontinuation of, treatment, particularly in children and adolescents. The melanocortin (MC) pathway, in
particular central MC4-receptor (MC4R) signaling, has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis.
Previous evidence, including our own, has shown that treatment with MCR agonists is effective at inducing weight
loss in obese patients caused by deficient hypothalamic MC signaling, including patients with genetic obesity
and forms of hypothalamic injury-related obesity, in part, by increasing energy expenditure. While treatment with
the MC4R agonist setmelanotide (SETMEL) is effective, as a monotherapy it is limited, and there may also be
unwanted off-target effects such as non-selective MC1R-mediated melanocyte stimulation and
hyperpigmentation. Our group has therefore focused on the development of a new generation of therapeutics
that target multiple receptors of complementary neurocircuits regulating energy balance to induce greater weight
loss, with minimal side effects. In support of this, our recently published findings show that our first tri-agonist
GEP44, which targets the GLP-1R and the neuropeptide receptors Y1R and anorexigenic Y2-R, reduces feeding
and body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents and shrews more potently than GLP-1RAs exendin-4 and
liraglutide, but without nausea and emesis. Based on these findings, we recently developed a novel GLP-
1R/MC4R dual agonist (KCEM1) and our Preliminary Data show that treatment of DIO rats with KCEM1 reduced
food intake and body weight, and improved glycemic control compared to controls, and these effects were
stronger vs. equimolar injections of the GLP-1RA liraglutide, and semaglutide, respectively. The goal of this
research is to: 1) fully characterize and develop our GLP-1R/MC4R monomeric peptide dual agonists with
improved efficacy by optimizing specific MC4R binding (over MC1/2/3/5Rs), and 2), create two novel
neuropeptide Y receptor Y2R/MC4R agonists, which act independently of the GLP-1R pathway entirely thus
avoiding associated side-effects. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that KCEM1 both prevents and reverses
DIO and improves glucoregulation relative to vehicle and FDA-approved single agonists. Comprehensive
measures of energy homeostasis will be supported by the Nutrition Obesity Research Center Energy Balance
Core at the University of Washington. Specific Aim 2 (exploratory) will develop novel GLP-1R/MC4R and
Y2R/MC4R dual agonists including long-acting lipidated multiagonists, and elucidate their penetration into the
brain, receptor binding, and tissue-specific mechanisms in brain areas of energy homeostasis and peripheral
tissues. Together, this work is expected to identify novel, safe, and effective treatments for pediatric obesity."
10919207,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as the loss of 1 L of blood or more within 24 hours after birth, is the 
leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Importantly, PPH is the most preventable cause of maternal 
mortality, and the leading factors causing preventable PPH are delays in diagnosis and treatment. Thus, 
there is an urgent need for an early and accurate alert system that can facilitate prompt treatment to 
prevent PPH-related morbidity and mortality. During hemorrhage, the body tries to compensate for blood 
loss by shunting blood from the periphery to vital organs and replenishing reduced blood volume with water 
from the interstitium. These compensation mechanisms help stabilize the patient, delaying the time until 
global vascular indicators such as blood pressure and heart rate are affected, the current measurements 
used to predict PPH. Thus, monitoring of peripheral blood flow and blood content can yield early indicators 
of hemorrhage. Optical technologies are well suited to noninvasively measure blood flow and blood 
content. Preliminary experiments demonstrated sensitivity to reduced perfusion in vivo and measured 
significant differences between blood samples diluted to physiologic levels seen during PPH using 
complimentary optical approaches. We hypothesize that early changes in peripheral blood flow and water 
transfer from interstitium to the vasculature will be detected using wearable optical techniques, and such 
changes can signal early stages of PPH. We will develop a multifunctional wearable optical device and test 
it in pregnant patients at high and low risk of PPH. These studies will create a database of PPH signatures 
that will help inform diagnostic algorithms that will provide an early warning system for improved PPH 
management."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of mortality in individuals
with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Although T cells are well known to play a critical role in T1D development,
attacking and destroying the insulin-producing β-cells, very little is known about the expansion of specific T cell
populations and clones in cardiovascular complications associated with T1D. Our project aims to dissect the
relationship between increased recruitment and expansion of harmful T cells in the atherosclerotic milieu of
T1D, leveraging the unique resources of the CaRe-T1D biobank. By employing single cell-T cell receptor-
sequencing (scTCR-seq) and cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes-sequencing (CITE-seq) of
circulating PBMCs, we will illuminate T cell populations altered in T1D and investigate their adhesion to human
coronary artery endothelial cells. By performing TCR-seq on atherosclerotic lesions and elucidate localization
of T cell population associated with lesion stage by spatial and global proteomics we will delineate the role
these T cells might play in the increased CVD risk associated with T1D.
 We hypothesize that atherosclerotic lesions in T1D are characterized by increased accumulation of specific
T cell populations and clones correlating with lesion severity and necrosis, and that the accumulation of T cells
in T1D-related atherosclerotic and renal kidney lesions mirror each other, driven by similar immunometabolic
perturbations. Two specific aims will address this hypothesis. We will 1) Clarify mechanisms of increased T cell
adhesion and tissue recruitment in T1D cases; and 2) Investigate clonal expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
in atherosclerotic lesions in T1D. By correlating selective T cell markers with a thorough characterization of
lesion features, our studies will provide novel information on T cells in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and
renal kidney injury in T1D in contrast with controls and T2D.
 Our project is led by a coalition of scientists and physician-scientists with extensive expertise in diabetes,
diabetes complications (atherosclerosis and diabetic kidney disease) and immunology, with deep
methodological proficiency in human studies, multi-omics analyses, and integrated biology. This diverse
expertise ensures a holistic approach and full utilization of the unique resources of the CaRe-T1D, enabling us
to navigate the complex interplay of metabolic and immune processes in T1D with unparalleled depth and
precision. Our comparative analyses between peripheral blood mononuclear cells, atherosclerotic lesions and
kidneys from the CaRe-T1D biobank will provide a robust platform for identifying and testing potential
therapeutic targets. Our focus on the metabolic-immune interface within atherosclerotic lesions, and
specifically on identifying specific T cell populations and clones, offers a novel perspective on pathogenesis,
positioning our study to make significant contributions to the field."
11070652,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Experiences of childhood adversity are common in the United States and account for a substantial proportion of
pediatric-onset psychopathology. Understanding mechanistic pathways that contribute to this heightened
psychopathology risk is, therefore, of critical consequence to public health. The Dimensional Model of Adversity
and Psychopathology (DMAP) proposes that adverse experiences characterized by deprivation (e.g., neglect)
may have distinct neurodevelopmental consequences in the frontoparietal network that confer risk for pediatric
psychopathology. While existing theory emphasizes the importance of early childhood experiences of deprivation
in shaping development in the frontoparietal network, existing neurodevelopmental research on childhood
adversity is primarily cross-sectional and has focused almost exclusively on neural and mental health outcomes
in adolescent samples. In two highly related pediatric neuroimaging samples with rich assessment of early
childhood adversity exposure and psychopathology (Sample 1: R01MH115004; Sample 2: R01MH120314), we
seek to address these gaps in the literature and Goal 2 of the NIMH strategic plan by identifying
neurodevelopmental pathways linking deprivation with transdiagnostic psychopathology risk first in early
childhood and then longitudinally from early childhood through adolescence. The proposed study will first
examine concurrent associations of deprivation with altered frontoparietal network activation during cognitive
control (Aim 1). We hypothesize that deprivation will be associated with worse cognitive control performance and
reduced activation in the frontoparietal network (Sample 1). Next, we will characterize early childhood
deprivation-related alterations to trajectories of cortical structure in the frontoparietal control network (Aim 2). We
hypothesize that deprivation will be associated with blunted intra-individual longitudinal trajectories of cortical
thinning in the frontoparietal network (Sample 2). Finally, we will examine deprivation-related alterations to brain
function and structural development as potential mechanisms contributing to childhood and adolescent
psychopathology (Aim 3). We hypothesize that decreased activation in the frontoparietal network during cognitive
control will mediate the association of early childhood deprivation with concurrent psychopathology (Sample 1).
Furthermore, we predict that altered longitudinal trajectories of cortical structure in the frontoparietal control
network will mediate the association of early childhood deprivation with adolescent psychopathology. Training
aims include advanced training in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, longitudinal modeling
of neuroimaging data, and latent modeling of pediatric psychopathology. The applicant’s training will be
supported by her sponsor’s and consultants’ expertise in these areas and extensive institutional resources.
Findings will have implications for population health by identifying pathways of transdiagnostic psychopathology
risk that can inform future early intervention efforts for childhood adversity involving deprivation."
11058785,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by genomic instability, abnormal chromatin relaxation, and
transposable element (TE) mobilization, which can harm neuronal function. However, the understanding of these
processes and their impact on neuronal physiology remains limited. In a recent study on Alzheimer's disease
(AD), we discovered a novel mechanism involving the upregulation and hyper-phosphorylation of the c-JUN
subunit of the AP-1 transcriptional activator. This hyperactive AP-1 complex, in conjunction with the BAF
chromatin remodeling complex, led to the inappropriate de-repression and activation of TE-derived chromatin
regions in AD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The aberrant TE de-repression resulted in
the accumulation of TE-derived RNA::DNA hybrids, triggering cGAS/STING activation and apoptosis.
The c-JUN/JNK pathway is also implicated in C9orf72-associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and
frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD), where haploinsufficiency of the C9orf72 gene results in impaired
autophagy and the accumulation of damaged cellular components. This accumulation triggers an innate immune
response, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal death. Given the shared involvement of the c-JUN/JNK
pathway, inflammation, and cell death in AD and related dementias (ADRD), we propose to investigate the c-
JUN/TE/cGAS/STING axis in the context of C9-ALS/FTD by developing the following aims:
Aim 1 seeks to identify cell-type specific patterns of transposon mobilization in C9-ALS/FTD by profiling TE
mobilization in brain organoids derived from patient iPSC lines. Furthermore, analysis of post-mortem brain
tissues using ATAC-seq will identify cell-specific patterns of TE activation, integrating data from organoids and
post-mortem tissues to unravel transposon activity across different brain cell types.
Aim 2 seeks to elucidate the activation of the c-JUN/TEs/cGAS/STING pathway in C9-ALS/FTD. Patient-derived
iPSC lines will be used to generate brain organoids and study the accumulation of TE-derived RNA::DNA hybrids
and activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. Findings will also be validated in CNS post-mortem tissue from C9-
ALS/FTD patients.
Aim 3 will explore the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the c-JUN/TE/cGAS/STING pathway. Targeting the
pathway in C9-ALS/FTD organoids with small molecule inhibitors could mitigate pathological consequences
associated with its activation, providing potential therapeutic strategies for ALS/FTD.
In summary, this project aims to investigate the involvement of the c-JUN/TE/cGAS/STING pathway in C9-
ALS/FTD and evaluate its therapeutic potential. By deciphering the mechanisms underlying TE mobilization,
identifying cell-specific patterns, and assessing the efficacy of pathway inhibition, this study will contribute to our
understanding of C9-ALS/FTD pathogenesis and provide insights into potential therapeutic interventions."

Glaucoma is a globally unmet medical challenge and a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor of glaucoma; yet, clinically it is neither required nor sufficient to
cause neuronal damage. The mechanisms underlying glaucomatous neurodegeneration are not fully
understood. Recently, we have provided the first convincing evidence demonstrating an immune mechanism
underlying neurodegeneration in glaucoma. We showed in both the inducible and inherited glaucomatous
mouse models that elevated IOP induced upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), retinal microglial
activation and T cell infiltration/HSP-specific CD4+ T cell responses and that retinal immune responses are the
driving force for progressive RGC and axon degeneration in glaucoma. Remarkably, in germ free mice, which
are deficient in HSP-specific T cells, IOP elevation failed to induce microglial activation, HSP-specific T cell
responses, and glaucomatous neurodegeneration. These results strongly support that elevated IOP presents a
physical stress rather than direct damage to RGCs and axons; it is the stress-evoked events, likely involving
both innate and adaptive immune responses that cause glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The key
unanswered questions are how elevated IOP activates microglia and T cell responses to induce RGC and
axon damage and what are the molecular signals that induce microglial and T cell responses in glaucoma.
HSP expression, especially when released from the cell, is known to induce both innate and adaptive immune
responses. We hypothesize that elevated IOP induces HSP signaling, leading to microglial activation and HSP-
specific T cell responses, which in turn cause RGC degeneration in glaucoma. In the present application, we
propose to critically test this hypothesis from three complementary angles: 1) to determine if HSP signaling is
responsible for initiating both innate and adaptive immune responses in the retina and inducing glaucomatous
neurodegeneration; 2) to investigate if HSPs are key pathogenic antigens driving T cell responses in
glaucoma; and 3) to test if levels of HSP-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with glaucoma can
serve as biomarkers for diagnosis or predication of glaucoma progression. The proposed studies will be carried
out as a collaborative effort among investigators and glaucoma specialist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear
and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who have complementary expertise and a long history of
productive collaboration. Elucidation of the immune mechanisms in glaucomatous neurodegeneration would
lead to a paradigm shift in the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and provide a basis for the
development of mechanism-based diagnosis, prevention and treatments. Given that the retina has long been
served as a model for the central nervous system, the proposed studies may also shed light on the
pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative disorders afflicting the brain and spinal cord."
11074379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A central problem in neuroscience is to understand how the brain controls innate behaviors. While reductionist
experiments have been invaluable in isolating specific neural functions and their links to behaviors, they may
not capture the full complexity of the brain performing ecologically relevant tasks; natural signals and natural
behaviors are inherently complex, context-dependent, and continuous. Like other complex behaviors, vocal
communication is facilitated by the coordination of networks of neurons that integrate auditory perception and
motor planning for goal-directed decision-making. Linking neural signaling to the production of flexible vocal
communication behaviors therefore requires characterization of the properties of network level neural
interactions across multiple contexts. This proposal meets this challenge by leveraging a well-developed model
for vocal communication, songbirds, a species that produces and relies on complex acoustic signals. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate how context in the form of acoustic cue, internal states, and
behavioral motivations affect neural population dynamics during vocal communication behaviors. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that context-dependent interactions shift neural population dynamics to allow
auditory and motor regions to affect different perceptual experiences or behavioral goals. This hypothesis will
be tested through the following two phases: With my dissertation, I will determine how neural population
dynamics in an auditory region are differentially structured and coordinated across internal and acoustic
contexts during auditory perception. Preliminary data demonstrate significant alteration in temporal processing
of auditory information as a function of context during perceptual categorization. In the F99 phase, I leverage
innovative latent space models and state-of-the-art dynamical systems theory to asses network-level
interactions across predictive cue conditions in addition to active and passive auditory perception. Primary
results will enable novel insight into the mechanisms that allow populations of neurons to create different
perceptual experiences across acoustic and internal contexts. In the K00 phase, I utilize advanced
electrophysiological methods to assess neural population dynamics, recording activity from large populations
of single neurons within a pre-motor area during vocal production (singing) in various behavioral contexts. I will
employ the same analytical framework to measure neural dynamics across behaviors in order to characterize
the links between neural dynamics and context. These findings will provide a mechanism for how neural
interactions across the network coordinate to produce vocal gestures across behavioral contexts.
 The carefully designed training plan integrates scientific and professional development activities to
support my goal of becoming an independent neuroscience researcher leading an academic laboratory. I will
work with my sponsors to continue acquiring the proposed skills and to enable me to find the right postdoctoral
training environment that aligns with my long-term research and career goals."

Optimizing blood cell support for specific patient groups and clinical settings is an emerging priority in
transfusion medicine. Patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) require significant
transfusion support (including red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) because of the transplant-related
bone marrow (BM) dysfunction state. However, challenges and shortcomings still exist for modern transfusion
practices in the peri-transplant setting, limiting their clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. Mechanisms
underlying the effect and effectiveness of blood transfusion in the peri-transplant setting are important,
understudied, and poorly understood, representing a critical gap in our biomedical knowledge. A coordinated,
multi-disciplinary P01 program project on such mechanisms is warranted, considering the medical and public
health significance of blood transfusion and cellular therapies, and will be innovative, constituting a distinct
area of investigation in the current NIH portfolio. The long-term thematic objective of this research program is
to provide more effective transfusion support for HCT recipients by better understanding the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying the effect and effectiveness of blood transfusion in the peri-transplant setting.
Drs. John Manis, Leslie Silberstein, and Shin-Young Park (Project 1) will elucidate the dynamic relationship
between BM niche and HSPC in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, specifically hypothesizing that insight into
how BM vascular and perivascular niches are distorted in SCD and restored by RBC transfusion shall lead to
opportunities for targeted intervention in HSC transplantation in SCD patients. Drs. Hongbo Luo and Li Chai
(Project 2) will study cell death signaling in granulocyte transfusion (GTX), specifically hypothesizing that GTX
can be improved by simultaneously targeting multiple death pathways. This study will assist us to design novel
therapeutic strategies for improving the efficacy of GTX and combating neutropenia-related infections in the
peri-transplant period. Drs Jose Cancelas and Yi Zheng (Project 3) will focus on platelet transfusion which is
commonly used to prevent or treat bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients, including HCT recipients. The goal is
to elucidate the role of RHOA/RAC1 signaling in cold storage-induced clearance of platelets and to design
novel clinical procedures (e.g. pharmacological inhibition of RHOA) for the long-term storage and application of
platelets in transfusion medicine. The 3 research projects will be bolstered by a unique Cytometry and
Imaging Core, led by Dr. Shin-Young Park, to maximize efficiency, economy, and productivity. An
Administrative Core will coordinate the activities of these projects and cores to form a cohesive whole. The
overall scientific synergy of ideas, reagents and expertise afforded by the multiple collaborations shall enable
this Program Project to advance our understanding of the biology of blood transfusion, and to apply findings
made toward enhancing the effectiveness of modern-day blood transfusion therapy for specific patient groups
in the peri-transplant setting."

voice symptoms from speaking in noisy environments; for most, the symptoms resolve quickly. However, for
those with MTD, voice symptoms often persist, making it difficult for them to meet their occupational and social
vocal demands. The reasons for this persistence are unknown. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the
underlying mechanisms of voice production in noisy environments to optimize and individualize voice
assessment and treatment for these individuals with MTD. Most speakers increase their vocal intensity while
speaking in noisy environments, a phenomenon known as the Lombard effect. Speaking during and after
exposure to a loud environment presumably requires monitoring of both background noise and one’s own voice,
and then responding with vocal motor adjustments. This implies that sensorimotor integration is crucial in these
real-life circumstances. There is preliminary evidence that individuals with MTD have atypical auditory-motor
integration and an atypical persistence of Lombard responses after speaking in noise. However, no known
studies have comprehensively characterized the underlying mechanisms and clinically relevant voice changes
of the Lombard effect for those with and without MTD. To develop evidenced-based diagnostics and targeted
voice treatments, we must better understand the processes and voice changes associated with speaking in daily
life. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1) investigate the sensorimotor mechanisms of the Lombard
effect and 2) characterize clinically relevant voice changes associated with the Lombard effect for individuals
with and without MTD within a communicative context. Sixty speakers (30 with MTD and 30 without) will complete
a Lombard task to measure vocal responses and self-reported vocal effort while communicating during and after
exposure to a noisy environment. Inexperienced listeners will rate overall severity of dysphonia for the speakers’
speech samples from the Lombard task. Lombard responses will be analyzed behaviorally and neuro-
computationally, and they will be compared between the groups and across various stages of the Lombard task.
Clinically relevant vocal measures (i.e., acoustic, self-reported vocal effort, and listener-auditory perceptual
ratings of overall severity of dysphonia) of the Lombard task will be compared across groups and phases of the
experimental task. This project is theoretically and clinically significant; it will fill in a substantial gap, providing
theoretical insight into the sensorimotor mechanisms of MTD in real-life environmental contexts, and contributing
to the clinical evidence to improve diagnostics and individualize treatment for those with sensorimotor deficits
underlying their voice disorders."

 Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 800,000 deaths each year.1,2
Suicide rates continue to increase in the U.S.3 Patients seen in the emergency department are at elevated risk
of death4 and future suicidal behaviors.5 Most research on suicide risk factors has identified static, dispositional
factors.4 For instance, distal predictors of who is at risk for suicidal behaviors include dysfunctional emotional
responses1 and decision-making deficits.2 These data inform us about groups at elevated suicide risk, but do
very little to predict with useful precision when people will have suicidal thoughts or act on suicide thoughts.
Thus, there is an urgent need to identify proximal risk factors for suicide risk.
 The Parent Study, “EMERGE: Ecological Momentary Evaluation of Responses to Gain/Loss and Emotions”
(R01MH128546), addresses this question with ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of emotions and
reinforcement learning as predictors of near-term suicidal thoughts and behaviors in 170 emergency department
patients seen for a suicide-related complaint. Yet emergency department patients are disproportionately low
income7 and minoritized,8 and many are unstably housed.9 This population is therefore simultaneously critical to
consider in suicide research and difficult to retain in research studies, as evidenced by high attrition from
enrollment to our initial assessment period. This supplement application is intended to address these challenges
that have the potential to compromise our efforts to (1) collect adequate data to allow for an examination of our
primary aims with sufficient power, (2) manage risk without undermining data validity, and (3) understand barriers
to implementing future clinical interventions based on our results. Specifically, Aim 1 increases the sample size
of enrolled participants to overenroll to 210 and increase monetary incentives to allow for adequately powered
analyses. Aim 2 evaluates participants’ experiences of the risk assessment protocols and their impact on data
validity via additional survey and interview methods. Aim 3 identifies barriers and facilitators of accessing
psychiatric care in this population via additional survey and interview methods.
 To date, our research team has shown the ability to enroll participants on target and conduct this study safely.
This supplement will leverage this study of a particularly vulnerable population and allow us to make substantial
inroads in improving our suicide research and care."
11063040,"The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eliminate trachoma, the world’s leading infectious cause of
blindness. To determine if trachoma treatment is needed in an area, the WHO recommends eye examinations
on a population-based sample of children by personnel certified in trachoma grading. The WHO’s successful
trachoma elimination campaign has created a situation in which some areas have too many to trachoma cases
to declare elimination but too few trachoma cases to certify trachoma graders. Adopting smartphone-based
trachoma telemedicine addresses this issue by allowing workers with little clinical experience to perform
trachoma photo-surveys for remote trachoma diagnoses. However, the WHO’s current data collection platform
for trachoma surveys, Tropical Data, does not currently support ocular photography. We propose here to
integrate smartphone photography with Tropical Data and add functionality that will transform it into a more
user-friendly, open access suite of smartphone-based survey modules. This would enhance flexibility and
facilitate broader health surveys that can be used to better target limited health resources.
This first part of the study aims to develop and refine the hardware and software necessary to integrate
smartphone conjunctival photography into the Tropical Data platform, and to assess the feasibility of the
resulting product in remote community-based settings in Peru. First, modules for photography, visual acuity
assessment, autorefraction, sample collection, and user-defined questionnaires will be added to the existing
Tropical Data application. Second, the impact of varying smartphone models and/or ambient lighting will be
assessed for each module. Third, the updated mobile application will be tested in a small number of villages to
determine the feasibility of testing multiple modules per child.
The second part of the study validates the components of the smartphone-based system when used in three
different field locations in Peru (e.g., jungle, mountains, desert). We will examine the sensitivity and specificity
of smartphone photography relative to certified human graders, smartphone visual acuity relative to standard
ETDRS visual acuity, and autorefraction relative to human refraction, and hypothesize that these metrics will
be superior to pre-defined minimally acceptable criteria.
The UCSF Proctor Foundation and Cayetano University in Peru will collaborate to achieve these goals. We
will work in close cooperation with the WHO and Tropical Data, who will be actively engaged in this research
throughout development and testing. This research has great potential for wide dissemination and positive
impact on health."
11062592,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 For transgender and nonbinary (TNB) people, anti-TNB stigma is a risk factor for adverse alcohol
outcomes, often co-occurring with depression and anxiety. Stigma’s impact on alcohol use and mental health is
of particular concern in TNB young adults (YA; 21-30 years old), who report more adverse alcohol and mental
health outcomes than older TNB adults. For these YA, favorable romantic relationship experiences may
attenuate the mental health impact of anti-TNB stigma, yet stigma may contribute to adverse relationship
experiences (e.g., intimate partner violence; IPV) linked to adverse alcohol and mental health outcomes.
Accordingly, relationship-focused interventions have the potential to improve alcohol and mental health
outcomes in TNB YA. However, targets for such interventions remain unclear—first, because the mechanisms
by which stigma affects relationship experiences have not been identified, and second, because it is not clear
what kinds of general or TNB-specific relationship experiences should be addressed. This project responds to
these gaps, culminating in development of a relationship-focused intervention for alcohol use and co-occurring
depression/anxiety in TNB YA. In Aim 1, I will collect survey data from 200 TNB YA in romantic relationships to
revise and validate a new measure of TNB-specific relationship experiences. In Aim 2, I will use the new
measure in a 2-month weekly diary study of stigma, relationship experiences, alcohol use, and
depression/anxiety (n=250 TNB YA in romantic relationships). I will use these data to (1) assess weekly
associations of stigma and relationship experiences with alcohol use and depression/anxiety, and (2) identify
mechanisms by which stigma may affect relationship experiences. In Aim 3, I will adapt an existing type of
online alcohol intervention—technology-adapted motivational interviewing with personalized feedback—by
tailoring content for TNB YA and (if supported by Aim 2 findings) adding components to address relationship
experiences in the context of anti-TNB stigma. The intervention, Whole Selves, will be developed through a
multi-phase co-design process with 8 TNB YA, followed by evaluation of acceptability, usability, and
engagement in user-testing interviews (n=5 TNB YA in romantic relationships) and a single-arm feasibility
study (n=107 TNB YA in romantic relationships). In the K99 phase, this work will be coordinated with training in
psychometrics/scale development, diary methods, and community-engaged intervention development, with
mentorship from senior scholars known for applying these methods to research on stigma, alcohol use, mental
health, and romantic relationships. This training and mentorship will prepare me to develop and evaluate
Whole Selves in the R00 phase, producing preliminary data for an R01 efficacy trial proposal. Thus, the project
and associated training will allow me to launch an independent research career with the goals of (1) identifying
the mechanisms by which stigma affects young people’s alcohol use and mental health, and (2) partnering with
affected communities to mitigate these effects through scalable interventions."

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that low-dose computed tomography can substantially reduce
lung cancer mortality, albeit at the cost of relatively high rates of false positives and complications from
downstream procedures. However, systematic differences between trial and general populations eligible for
lung cancer screening raise concerns about the relevance of trial findings for guiding the development and
dissemination of lung cancer screening programs in clinical practice. Despite clear recommendations from the
United States Preventative Services Task Force, lung cancer screening uptake and adherence remain low.
Several studies have documented dramatic and selective attrition across the screening continuum – where
about 10-20% of eligible individuals undergo lung cancer screening and of those, only about 40-60% are up-to-
date with their annual screening at 15 months. When the benefits and harms of an intervention vary across
subgroups and there is selective attrition, the balance of population-level benefits and harms is expected to
change. As such, there is an urgent need to better characterize the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with
low-dose computed tomography when applied to individuals outside of clinical trial settings. The primary
objective of this proposal is to generate real-world evidence of the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening
with low-dose computed tomography that explicitly considers the characteristics of populations at each step of
the screening continuum, from the screening-eligible, to the screened, to the adherent. To address this
objective, we will use cutting-edge causal inference methods, including trial transport and target trial emulation
using real-world data, which can avoid the potential for time-related biases. To carry-out our proposed
analyses, we will draw upon individual-level data from the randomized National Lung Screening Trial, as well
as four real-world datasets including the National Health and Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factors
Surveillance Survey (Lung Cancer Screening Module), a 20% nationwide sample of Medicare claims, and the
North Carolina Lung Screening Registry. Findings from this study will generate information about the
effectiveness of lung cancer screening in real-world settings that can be used by patients, providers, and
policymakers. This work will enhance the evidence base used by policymakers to update screening
recommendations and refine decision aids to support communication with patients about screening net-
benefits during shared decision-making. Ultimately, this work will support efforts to improve the delivery of lung
cancer screening at the population level."

 New approaches to antibiotic development are needed to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria, and
especially Gram-negative pathogens. The Gram-negative outer membrane prevents most molecules from
entering the cell and is one of the greatest hurdles to new antibiotic development. A remarkable strategy to
overcome this permeability barrier is shown by the new clinical antibiotic cefiderocol, which binds outer
membrane siderophore receptors and uses active transport systems to pull itself into the periplasm. Using
energy-coupled import allows otherwise exclude molecules, like the antibacterial component of cefiderocol, to
enter bacteria. Unfortunately, few molecules capable of this translocation have been identified, and we have
been largely limited to using siderophore conjugates to develop these innovative Trojan horse antibiotics. Our
work on the understudied class of bacteriocins called microcins provides a rare opportunity to study a broader
class of antibacterials with this membrane translocation ability. Microcins are small antibacterial proteins
(<10kDa) that selectively bind Gram-negative outer membrane proteins and hijack active transport processes to
enter the periplasm. Microcins have are effective at controlling pathogen growth in vivo and have many
characteristics that could make them attractive antibiotic scaffolds. Despite their potential value, advances in
microcin biology have been impeded by the challenges of their identification and the limited characterization of
the only 15 known examples. To overcome the discovery bottleneck, we developed an approach for systematic
identification and validation of new microcins. We have focused our research on class II microcins due to their
prevalence among Gram-negative bacteria. Coupling an in silico pipeline with a new method for microcin activity
screening, we are identifying microcins across phylogenetically diverse bacteria, including phylogroups that have
never been examined for microcin activity. We have already validated over 50 novel class II microcins, which is
5X what has been discovered in the past 40 years. Our new appreciation for class II microcin diversity has made
plain the critical need to develop detailed knowledge of their sequence-activity relationships to empower their
future use in antibiotic development. Foremost among our gaps in knowledge is our lack of understanding of
microcin cell entry and the diversity of receptors that microcins can target. These factors dictate the initial step
required for microcins to cross the outer membrane and are central to controlling microcin spectrum of activity.
To pursue these critical gaps in knowledge, we will take advantage of the large exclusive repertoire of
unrecognized class II microcins we have discovered and will (Aim 1) provide the first in-depth microcin sequence-
activity study to uncover postions import for receptor binding, cell entry, and antibacterial activity, (Aim 2) reveal
how sequence variations among microcins influence their spectrum of activity, and (Aim 3) uncover the range of
outer membrane receptors that can be targeted by microcins for cell entry."

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a virally-driven malignancy caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
that remains a leading cause of global cancer-related morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV
(PLWH). In our ongoing prospective KS cohort in Uganda (the “HIPPOS” study), treatment outcomes remain
poor despite optimized treatment with antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy, with an overall 1-year survival
of only 64% among the first 200 study participants. Importantly, however, we observed differential outcomes
among participants, with ~10% achieving a complete remission (CR), ~48% a partial response (PR), and ~25%
progressive disease (PD). Understanding the biologic mechanisms underlying these response differences
could inform the design of more effective therapies for KS.
Findings from several of our studies based on the HIPPOS KS cohort suggest that ongoing KSHV replication is
an important driver of KS tumorigenesis, and that KSHV expression profiles in KS tumors are likely modified by
HIV co-infection and the host immune infiltrate. We hypothesize that control of KSHV replication and
suppression of viral oncogenic gene products in KS tumors is necessary for KS tumor regression.
We now propose to build on these observations by evaluating how signatures of KSHV, HIV, and host immune
cell composition in KS tumors over time are associated with tumor response among participants in the
HIPPOS cohort. To date, the HIPPOS cohort has enrolled over 280 participants (including both HIV-associated
and HIV-negative KS), and we have established an extensive biorepository of clinically annotated specimens,
including more than 1,500 plasma samples and 1,350 KS tumor biopsies. Importantly, these samples are
collected serially before, during, and following treatment and linked to participant response assessments.
We now propose to leverage this unique cohort to assess changes that occur in KSHV, HIV, and host immune
signatures over the course of KS treatment and to determine how these signatures are related to KS tumor
regression or progression. We will use existing data from the HIPPOS cohort as well as perform RNA-
sequencing and multispectral immunohistochemistry on a subset of KS samples to characterize viral gene
expression and host immune responses in the KS tumor microenvironment (TME). Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. To determine if suppression of plasma KSHV replication over the course of treatment is associated with
improved KS response or survival.
Aim 2. To identify signatures of KSHV and HIV gene expression and host immune cell infiltration in KS tumors
that are associated with response to treatment.
Aim 3. To determine if the number and/or localization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the KS TME
associated with KS treatment response."
11076507,"07 Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to interrogate the dynamics of membrane voltage in the context of intact
brains with high spatiotemporal resolution. Optical methods to dissect neuronal activity promise to revolutionize
our understanding of the brain at the cellular and circuit level; however, our understanding remains incomplete
due, in part, to a lack of tools that can report directly on neuronal activity with sufficient speed and sensitivity.
We propose to use the power of molecular design and organic chemistry to develop and apply new optical tools
for monitoring membrane potential with unprecedented speed and sensitivity in intact brains and without
disruptive capacitive load associated with other classes of voltage indicators. We plan to exploit photoinduced
electron transfer (PeT) through molecular wires as a versatile platform for optical voltage sensing. We will build
a palette of colors for optical voltage sensing that extends into the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum; we will create new voltage sensors with exceptionally high two-photon absorption cross sections for
use in thick tissue and intact brains; and we will explore methods for genetically targeting and localizing ultra-
sensitive fluorescent voltage sensors to neurons of interest. Throughout, development of molecular tools will be
closely wed to applications in neurons and tissues, and we will apply these tools to understand how membrane
potential dynamics change in both healthy and neurological disease states."

 The KwaZulu-Natal Clinical Trials Unit (KZN-CTU), strategically located in the epicentre of one of the
world’s most severe HIV and tuberculosis epidemics, seamlessly combines the Clinical Research Sites (CRSs)
of existing, high-performing CTUs at CAPRISA and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC). In
the current funding cycle, the combined CTUs enrolled 4,713 participants in 28 protocols, with an overall
retention rate of 93%. Further, several KZN-CTU scientists participated at the highest levels in the Clinical Trial
Networks (CTNs), making influential new scientific contributions, including as network Protocol Chairs, that
have impacted global policy/practice, including tenofovir-containing PrEP for HIV prevention, co-treatment
strategies to reduce HIV-tuberculosis deaths and nevirapine prophylaxis to reduce breastfeeding transmission.
 This renewal application’s goal is to make even greater contributions to the scientific priorities of all 4
CTNs through novel research concepts, innovative prevention technologies (eg. CAPRISA 256 antibody) and
high-quality clinical trials in high priority populations by experienced research teams at well-equipped CRSs.
The KZN-CTU, led by Quarraisha Abdool Karim of CAPRISA, comprises 4 components: i) Leadership and
governance, ii) Coordination and monitoring, and iii) 8 CRSs, supported by iv) 8 research support cores.
 The Leadership and governance component will ensure effective CTU decision-making and governance,
active engagement with each CTN and oversee the efficient functioning of the CTU. The Coordination and
monitoring component is responsible for coordination of clinical trial implementation at high quality. The 8
CRSs, with HIV incidence rates ranging from 4.6 to 8.2 per 100 person-years in recent trials, are in the highest
burden districts of South Africa with diverse populations suited to HIV prevention, vaccine and treatment trials
as well as trials in children, adolescents and pregnant women. The Support Cores work with all the CRSs
providing assistance in the conduct of clinical trials, with administration and financial resource management,
communication, evaluation, training and quality assurance, community engagement, pharmacy, laboratory,
data management and IT, and regulatory compliance. The CTU’s organizational structures (Leadership Group,
Executive Committee and Community Advisory Boards) and communication tools (regular meetings, video
conferences, monthly newsletters and an informative website) enable effective communication, coordination
and governance in the unit. The KZN-CTU has groundswell support from KwaZulu-Natal community groups
and high-level political backing of the National and Provincial Departments of Health.
 Overall, the KZN-CTU has well-characterized high-risk populations, well-established clinical facilities,
accredited laboratories, pharmacies, and data management systems, strong community linkages, and
extensive experience in conducting clinical trials, together with a track record of scientific innovation available
to support all 4 CTNs in developing new approaches to HIV and tuberculosis prevention and treatment."

Background. Over half of Veterans report musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, often with mental health comorbidities.
Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies are important non-pharmacologic treatment options for
these conditions. However, CIH is not widely available at the VA. Also, practitioner-delivered therapies (i.e.,
acupuncture or chiropractic) are promising, but providers would like patients to be more active in their pain
management by using self-care (i.e., meditation, tai chi, yoga) instead of relying on practitioner-delivered care.
A critical question for the field is whether adding self-care CIH to practitioner-delivered CIH is a more effective
approach than either strategy alone. However, we are unaware of anyone examining this. Also, to-date,
studying CIH in large VA samples has been difficult because few facilities capture CIH use with codes in their
electronic health records, and very few use the VA's standardized codes, preventing multi-site studies. In 2016,
Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act mandating expansion of CIH therapies in
VA. In response, 18 VA regional networks committed $5 million/yr to implement CIH therapies at 18 sites
beginning in 2018, focusing on five evidence-based therapies: acupuncture, chiropractic, Tai Chi, mindfulness,
and yoga. The VA's Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) will oversee this
effort, including the data collection efforts targeting 1,000 CIH users from each of the 18 sites. We propose
addressing the above gaps by continue our longstanding collaboration with OPCC&CT to capitalize on 1) the
2018 rollout of CIH in 18 VA sites and 2) our two current national/multisite studies of the effects of CIH, one on
MSK pain and the other which integrates CIH patient reported outcomes (PROs) measurement into clinical
care. We propose a large-scale pragmatic comparative effectiveness clinical trial to assess CIH. In the UG3
Planning Phase, as the 18 sites begin implementing CIH, we will develop and implement data collection
instruments and processes that we are currently piloting to capture CIH use and PROs: 1) pain and its intensity

inform that measurement, we will use multiple strategies, including an Advisory Board. In the UH3

Despite being at nearly twice the risk of developing Alzheimer’s or a related dementia (ADRD), Americans
identifying as Black or African American are 35% less likely to be diagnosed with ADRD than their White
counterparts. This marked disparity in dementia detection and diagnosis has corresponding implications for
delays in the initiation and continuation of treatment. Intervening to eradicate this disparity is a public health
imperative as the field of ADRD care is on the precipice of a sea change due to newly available disease modifying
therapies. These therapies require testing to confirm the presence of amyloid accumulation, and they must be
initiated in the early stages of cognitive impairment. Under the current paradigm, the vast majority of African
Americans adults for whom these new therapies may be appropriate will be diagnosed too late for their
administration. This proposal recognizes that structural factors shaping daily life, like societal stigma around
brain health disorders, and experiences of discrimination in medical settings, contribute profoundly to disparities
in ADRD detection among African American adults and require multilevel intervention to be dismantled. In
response to NIH RFA-NR-24-004, Transformative Research to Address Health Disparities and Advance Health
Equity, the long-term goal of this project is to address existing, and intercept a worsening of, disparities in early
detection and diagnosis of ADRD. To achieve our goal, we will carry out three primary objectives in partnership
with the Black Equity Coalition and the Allegheny County Health Department. Using the Culture-Centric Model
of Health Promotion, in Objective/Aim 1 we will elicit and prioritize the voices of African American adults who are
directly impacted by late-life cognitive health disparities to create stakeholder-endorsed brain health narrative
campaign materials for deployment over multimedia platforms. In Objective/Aim 2, we will use the materials
developed in Aim 1 to deploy a community-focused brain health narrative campaign to combat stigma around
brain health disorders in the places where African American adults at risk for ADRD live, work, shop, and play.
In Objective/Aim 3, we will assess the feasibility and acceptability of bringing state of the science AD blood-
based biomarker testing infrastructure to the places where African Americans at highest risk for ADRD live, work,
shop, and play. By targeting social norms and societal level forces like stigma, this proposal addresses
challenges at the NIMHD-defined community and societal levels, while, in the final aim building community-
based infrastructure for addressing a health disparity at the individual level. This approach begins by drawing
upon cultural capital in the form of community members’ stories that demonstrate the value of preserving brain
health or offer counternarratives about maintaining dignity through dementia. In full circle, these stories become
culturally salient tools to promote accessible, early AD detection in community-based settings, bypassing the
traditional healthcare systems and pathways to diagnosis that are not working for African Americans."

former recipient of a 5-year K24 Mid-Career Mentoring award (DK109114: Mentored Research to Improve
Care for Complex Patients with Diabetes). He has a robust track record of serving as a research and career
mentor to early-stage investigators. In the past 10 years, Dr. Grant has successfully mentored six under-
represented post-baccalaureate scholars through this same URM mechanism. The planned mentoring and
research training activities are designed to help Mr. Mejia gain new research skills and improve his potential for
successful enrollment in nursing school. His overarching career goal is to pursue advanced training to gain
necessary clinical and further research skills to become a leader in the field of Latino patient-centered
research. His proposed Administrative Supplement project will be a critical first step towards this career goal.
We have designed a plan that will give him the opportunity to learn quantitative skills (hypothesis, defining
exposures and outcomes, univariate and multivariate analysis techniques) and qualitative skills (drafting an
interview guide, focus group, thematic analysis within a conceptual framework). Given the ongoing health
disparities experience by older Latino patients with type 2 diabetes, there is a continuing need both within our
own institution and nationally for new researchers with strong culturally relevant backgrounds and personal
drive and interest in addressing the problems faced by these patients when interacting with the health care
system."

Clostridioides difficile is a clinically important opportunistic pathogen that exploits disruptions in the commensal
microbiome of the gastrointestinal tract. C. difficile infection (CDI) is characterized by colitis and diarrhea, which
are largely caused by two secreted toxins, TcdA and TcdB. These primary virulence factors bind to the cell
surface via their CROPs and internalization domains; upon cell internalization - they glycosylate Rho-family
proteins, thus disrupting Rho-dependent cellular processes, ultimately leading to inflammation and increased
epithelial permeability. The threat of CDI is rising due to the prevalence of hypervirulent and antibiotic resistant
strains. The increasing risk of CDI, combined with the shortcomings of conventional antibiotic and fecal
transplantation treatment options, poses an urgent need for novel therapies. Biotherapeutic approaches using
monoclonal anti-TcdA/TcdB antibodies indicated a promising route, complementary to antibiotics; however, they
suffer from cumbersome administration and limitations in biodistribution.
 Responding to these challenges, we developed neutralizing peptides that inhibit both TcdA and TcdB
and engineered probiotic yeast as a delivery vector of anti-toxin peptides in the colon. In our preliminary
work, we computationally designed and evaluated two experimentally effective neutralizing peptides (SA1 and
SB6), which demonstrated anti-TcdA and TcdB biorecognition and conferred epithelial protection in primary
derived human colonic epithelial monolayers. Additionally, we developed a yeast strain yielding >5 g/L peptide
during fermentation after knockout of key proteases.
 In this work, we propose to implement this toolbox to develop a comprehensive strategy against
TcdB-mediated C. difficile infection. To this end, we will computationally design peptides to bind to several
domains on TcdB and evaluate a broader set of therapeutic hypotheses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal
scales. First, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism of TcdB inhibition by SB6. This knowledge will inform a
concerted computational-experimental design of peptides that target the TcdB active domain and neutralize its
Rho glycosylation activity. Next, we will use recently published crystal structures and known receptor-binding
domains of TcdB to develop peptides that block TcdB’s entry into the cell. These peptides will be inspired by the
proteins to which TcdB natively binds on the cell surface, as well as the reference CROP-blocking antibody
Bezlotoxumab. Finally, we will engineer probiotic yeast to secrete these peptides, and characterize their efficacy
on human colonic epithelial cell and murine animal C. difficile infection models. Collectively, these efforts will
elucidate the mechanisms by which inhibitory peptides can block TcdB activity and use this knowledge to develop
optimized peptides that inhibit CDI by integrating expertise at the atomic, molecular, cellular, and organismal
scales."

 Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver cancer. The large (L)
envelope protein interacts with core particles to initiate virion formation, and inhibits small (S) envelope
protein secretion as subviral particles. In addition, L protein on virion surface binds to high-affinity HBV
receptor to mediate viral entry. The polymerase (P) gene has its 5' end overlapping with 3' core gene,
leading to much less P than core protein translation from the 3.5-kb pgRNA. The slightly longer pcRNA
generates hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Splicing of the 3.5-kb RNAs to remove a 0.5-kb intron causes
frameshift to convert core protein into core-P fusion protein, and P protein into P-L fusion protein (p43).
Low level of p43 was detected from in vitro transfection with cloned HBV genome, but it has not been
further studied. We accidentally detected high level of extracellular p43 from artificial mutants with lost L
protein expression, with further increase to the level of L protein from wild-type virus when combined
with a nonsense mutation in core gene. This R01 grant application will investigate the regulation of p43
translation, stability, and examine its clinical significance and functional properties. We hypothesize that
preferential translation of core-P fusion protein from spliced 3.5-kb RNA down regulates p43 at both
translation initiation and protein stability, and that p43 can promote HBV virion secretion but reduce
viral infectivity. Aim 1 will verify whether p43 is preferentially translated from spliced pgRNA or pcRNA,
and clarify whether the nonsense mutation in core gene increases p43 through translational
termination-reinitiation and/or lost expression of a p43 destabilizer. We will also examine whether p43
secretion is independent of S protein co-expression. In Aim 2 we will examine whether p43 protein level
can be increased by core promoter mutations to augment pgRNA transcription, G1896A precore
nonsense mutation to abolish HBeAg expression, and Q182* nonsense mutation in core gene to
convert both core protein and core-P fusion protein into a slightly shortened core protein. p43 will also
be monitored from viremic serum samples harboring such mutations. Aim 3 will determine the
distribution of p43 on virions vs. subviral particles. A role of p43 in modulating HBV virion secretion and
viral infectivity will be verified by blocking its expression through mutated splicing sites, followed by
adding back increasing doses of p43 through co-transfection experiments. So far all the seven known
HBV proteins are translated from unspliced RNAs. The proposed studies are significant in
characterizing the only viral protein generated by RNA splicing, and in establishing its clinical relevance
and functional properties. If p43 can inhibit HBV infectivity in a dose-dependent manner, that may open
up a new antiviral approach against chronic HBV infection."

People with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) have excessive risks for cardiovascular diseases (CVD),
even when they have well-controlled traditional CVD risk factors, such as hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia, without nephropathy (DN) or significant systemic insulin
resistance (IR). The presence of chronic autoimmunity in T1D may play a role since many
autoimmune diseases are associated with increased CVD risk. The lack of knowledge regarding
the pathologies of CVD in T1D is partially due to the difficulty of obtaining cardiovascular tissues
from people with T1D and the lack of true mice models of T1D and atherosclerosis. However,
the availability of arteries from T1D, T2D and non-diabetic subjects from the CaRe-T1D and
Medalists’ (T1D for >50 years) repositories have made it possible to have detailed comparative
analysis of potential differences amongst them. CVD studies of Medalists by history and
Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) score showed accelerated atherosclerosis despite well-
managed diabetes and absence of DN. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and
inflammatory cytokines, IL1β and interferon-γ correlated to CVD history Novel autoantibodies
(AAbs) to NFkBIB and loss of insulin signaling were found in arteries in both people and mice
(ApoE-/-/NOD) with T1D. Plasma metabolomics showed different and opposite changes in T1D
and T2D, in pathways related to adaptive immunity and CVD. Single cell sequencing (scRNA) of
aorta from diabetic mouse models of atherosclerosis due to deletion of insulin receptors showed
elevated inflammatory vascular smooth muscle cells. We postulated the novel idea that chronic
autoimmunity in T1D can promote inflammatory processes in the arterial wall, causing selective
insulin resistance only in the arteries to accelerate atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we
propose: Sp. Aim 1:To compare the pathologies, cellular composition (using spatial
transcriptomics) and insulin signaling of the atherosclerotic plaques from people T1D, vs T2D
and non-DM using tissues from the CaRe-T1D. Sp. Aim 2: To characterize differences in
circulatory novel anti-vascular autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines and metabolites of people
with T1D, monogenic DM, T2D and non-DM which can be correlated to severity of CAC or CVD
history. Sp. Aim 3: To test definitely whether enhancing insulin actions targeted to endothelial
cells (EC) can decrease innate and adaptive immunity induced inflammation at the arterial wall
and atherosclerosis, using T1D mouse, ECIRS1-/-/ApoE-/-/NOD mice."

Since the identification of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) in 1973, thousands of clinical and laboratory studies
have provided evidence demonstrating that prenatal alcohol exposure can result in numerous adverse effects in
multiple domains, affecting virtually every system of the body, with lifelong impacts on day-to-day functioning.
The term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) encompasses the broad range of alcohol’s adverse effects,
which occur independently of social, ethnic, or cultural background. The prevalence of FASD may be as high as
1.1 - 5.0%, significantly higher than that of other disorders, e.g., autism spectrum disorders and Down Syndrome.
FASD is thus an international public health, education, economic, and social concern, and there is an urgent
need for better recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder. The International Conferences on FASD,
hosted annually by University of British Columbia Interprofessional Continuing Education (IPCE) from 1987-
2019, were among the premier conferences in the field. They provided a unique venue where researchers,
professionals, and experts from a broad range of disciplines and from around the world came together to interact,
exchange ideas, and share information, not only with each other, but also with the stakeholder community,
including family members/caregivers and individuals with FASD as the voice of living experience. On hold since
2020 due to both the pandemic and the closure of IPCE, these conferences are now restarting in Seattle, WA,
under the sponsorship of FASD United (formerly the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, NOFAS),
and will continue to bring together the same unique mix of researchers, professionals, and the stakeholder
community. As before, conferences will be held annually in March or April and will alternate in focus by year.
The 2025, 2027, and 2029 conferences will focus on advanced research in epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis
and intervention: the 9th, 10th and 11th International Conferences on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder - Research,
Results and Relevance. The 2026 and 2028 conferences will similarly focus on research, but with a lens on
issues more relevant to adolescents and adults: the 10th and 11th International Research Conferences on
Adolescents and Adults with FASD. This R13, a renewal of AA028176, requests partial travel and registration
support to grow the attendance of junior US investigators, to support select investigators from foreign,
underrepresented countries with developing alcohol research programs, to promote collaboration with US
scientists, and to cover a portion of the extensive audiovisual expenses to assist with dissemination of content
beyond those attending in person. Funding from the proposed R13 will be critical in furthering the mission and
vision of these conferences, providing experiences to shape the careers of young investigators, building
international collaborations, bringing the voice of living experience to researchers, professionals and policy
makers to improve the lives of those with FASD and their families, and widely disseminating conference content."

 Defects in lipid metabolism are associated with neurological diseases and mood disorders, but
bioenergetics and regulation of lipid metabolism in the brain is not well defined. The brain is the most lipid-rich
tissue in mammals other than adipose with a unique profile of lipids necessary for proper nervous system
structure and function. However, how the brain uses lipids for energy and responds to dietary conditions that
impact available lipids is grossly understudied. Historically, there has been little consideration for a) the
existence, capacity, and relevance of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the brain in comparison to more prominent
sources of energy such as glucose (and ketones during fasting and starvation) nor b) how the brain senses
and adapts to changes in availability of lipids. Throughout my predoctoral training, I have already determined
(Aim 1a) that the mammalian brain normally oxidizes long chain fatty acids in vivo to a greater extent than
previously considered using a pan-brain-specific conditional mouse model incapable of FAO (manuscript in re-
review in MCB) and (Aim 1b) identified that expression of ethanolamine phosphate phospholyase (Etnppl)
(funded by F31, manuscript in prep), which has links to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in humans, is
upregulated by dietary fasting specifically in astrocytes from Ribo-Tag mice using translating ribosomal affinity
purification. The contributions of ETNPPL to the brain metabolome were evaluated using constitutive ETNPPL
knockout mice (ETNPPL-/-). Under the F99 phase, I will study (Aim 2a) how perturbations in hepatic FAO
(supplies brain ketones), using mice with FAO deletion in both brain and liver, impacts FAO bioenergetics in
brain and (Aim 2b) continue studying how the brain responds to metabolic cues by further characterizing
ETNPPL in the brain using adeno-associated virus-injected ETNPPL overexpressed mice. In preparation for
postdoctoral studies, I will expand my knowledge in neuro-HIV in a neuro-HIV seminar series, neuro-HIV
course, and other didactic training opportunities offered at Johns Hopkins in the F99 phase. Aims 1 was and
Aim 2 will be conducted in the laboratory of Michael Wolfgang, Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
during my graduate studies in the Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology Ph.D. Program. For the K00
phase, (Aim 3) I am pursuing postdoctoral training that will expand my current knowledge in lipid
neurometabolism in the context of an infectious disease with neuropathological manifestations. I have a
particular interest in the impact on brain lipid metabolism by HIV infection. This interest is based on high
indices of cognitive impairment and dementia in HIV infected patients (collectively known as HAND), the brain
being a reservoir for HIV, and antiretroviral drugs used long-term to treat HIV having metabolic side-effects. In
summary, these training opportunities afforded by the support of the D-SPAN award would be immensely
impactful towards my development into an innovative, independent researcher studying the intersection of
neuroscience, metabolism, and infectious disease."
11058987,"Many species depend on social activity to thrive, and social impairment is a fundamental symptom of several
mental diseases. According to research, synaptic signals and activity can control social behavior. Yet, it is still
unclear how synapse control and social behavior are related. δ-catenin functions as an anchor for the
glutamatergic AMPA receptor (AMPARs) to regulate synaptic activity in excitatory synapses. Several families
with autism have been identified to have mutations in the δ-catenin gene, which results in a loss of δ-catenin
functions at excitatory synapses and is thought to be the etiology of autism in people. Recent studies, including
our own, suggest that the loss of δ-catenin functions significantly decreases cortical neurons' inhibition to
increase excitation. Our new data further reveal that δ-catenin deficiency disrupts social behavior in mice. These
new findings strongly support the scientific premise that δ-catenin is critical for glutamatergic synaptic activity
and social behavior. Nonetheless, the δ-catenin-mediated link of synaptic, cellular, and neural substrates to
social behavior is understudied. The significance of the current proposal is thus predicated on filling this gap.
Postsynaptic glutamatergic activity in excitatory and inhibitory cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
regulates cellular excitation and inhibition to control prefrontal rhythmic activity patterns, which is essential in the
control of social behavior in humans and animals. However prior research on the neural basis of social behavior
has mostly concentrated on top-down mPFC projections to various subcortical regions. Hence, in these earlier
studies, glutamatergic inputs to prefrontal neurons were mainly disregarded. Therefore, it is unclear how the
postsynaptic glutamatergic activity of prefrontal cells relates to social behavior. Research suggests that
parvalbumin-positive (PV+) inhibitory interneurons in the mPFC receive direct glutamatergic inputs from multiple
subcortical regions to provide feedforward inhibition onto prefrontal pyramidal neurons and control network
activity. This is important for the regulation of social behavior. Our preliminary data suggest that δ-catenin
deficiency impairs prefrontal neural activity at cellular and network levels to induce social deficits. Therefore,
existing data and our new findings lead us to hypothesize that δ-catenin is important for glutamatergic activity
in PV+ inhibitory interneurons to provide feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the mPFC, which
regulates prefrontal activity at the cellular and network levels to ensure normal social behavior. We will employ
two new mouse models of δ-catenin deficiency - δ-catenin KO mice and human ASD-associated δ-catenin
glycine 34 to serine (G34S) mutant mice – to examine if δ-catenin controls pathway-specific glutamatergic activity
in PV+ interneurons and feedforward inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the mPFC (Aim 1), to determine
whether δ-catenin deficiency disrupts prefrontal network activity during social interaction (Aim 2), and to address
if altering prefrontal δ-catenin expression is sufficient to affect social behavior (Aim 3)."
11062264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While melatonin is commonly thought of as a regulator of circadian rhythm, it has broad physiologic actions.
Melatonin may regulate immune function and protect the host against toxicants. The parent grant aims to
investigate melatonin as a nephroprotectant agent. The nephroprotective effects are likely mediated through
binding to the MT1/MT2 receptors, activation of nuclear receptors, and receptor-independent mechanisms.
The current supplement aims to evaluate racial differences in endogenous serum melatonin concentrations,
mitochondrial density, and expression of MT1/MT2 in human kidneys. While data regarding plasma and urine
melatonin concentrations in humans are available, few studies have evaluated tissue concentrations, and even
fewer (if any) examined racial differences. Moreover, racial differences in mitochondrial density and MT1/MT2
receptor expression in human kidneys have not been previously examined. The kidneys have one of the
highest densities of mitochondria in the human body and are essential for kidney health. Understanding
biological differences may help identify why there are disparities in acute kidney injury."
11071014,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Enamel, the protective outer layer of our teeth, is crucial for maintaining dental health. A gene called amelogenin
plays a vital role in enamel formation, and it uses a process called alternative splicing to create different versions
of itself for various functions. When mutations occur in the amelogenin gene, it can lead to hereditary enamel
defects known as X-linked Amelogenesis Imperfecta (X-AI). Many mutations that cause hereditary diseases
affect the alternative splicing of the gene, in place of changing the amino acid within the final protein. Instead,
they alter the way the gene is spliced. However, X-AI and its causing mutations in amelogenin have not been
studied in association with alternative splicing until recently. Previous research has shown that a significant
number of X-AI-causing mutations are found in specific parts of the amelogenin gene called exons 4 and 5.
Research has demonstrated that these mutations can disrupt the alternative splicing of exon4 in laboratory
experiments, suggesting a direct link between these mutations, alternative splicing of exon4, and the
development of enamel defects.
However, there is not a full understanding of how this process works in the body or how these mutations impact
enamel formation by the change of alternative splicing in amelogenin. This current study aims to get answers to
these scientific questions by investigating how specific proteins called Ser/Arg rich splicing factors (SRSFs)
influence the splicing of amelogenin exon4. Additionally, the proposal explores how an X-AI-causing mutation
affects splicing patterns and contributes to enamel defects as teeth develop.
By examining these questions, the goal is to better understand the genetic factors behind X-AI and other related
conditions. Patients with X-AI have hypoplastic, hypo mineralized, and/or hypocalcified enamel, resulting in a
reduced quality of life due to discomfort caused by pain, increased chance of pulpal infections, and compromised
appearance. Ultimately, this knowledge could pave the way for improved treatments to enhance the quality of
life for patients affected by enamel defects."
11076558,"This proposal builds upon our metabolomics expertise in untargeted and targeted metabolomics for the
generation of highly sensitive and quantitative targeted multiplex assays. The idea behind generating such
assays for radiation assessment and radiation injury in easily accessible biofluids (urine, blood, saliva) is to
rapidly determine the extent of exposure of an individual and distinguish between the worried well and the
exposed individuals that may require medical intervention. Highly quantitative approaches will be undertaken
through liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify each already identified
radiation biomarkers in each biofluid. Such instruments are currently used routinely in clinical laboratories,
therefore maximizing the available resources for rapid evaluation of thousands of individuals during an
emergency. Based on criteria for sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio, low signal suppression from matrix
effects, and high fold changes compared to controls or relationships between pairs of metabolites,
biosignatures will be assembled and concentrations calculated. The combined biosignature will be developed
in a multiplex assay, effectively reducing the time between sample preparation to results. The goal is to
demonstrate that this multiplex assay method has the potential to be deployed in the case of an emergency to
a pre-determined network of clinical laboratories that can accept and rapidly process a high volume of
samples. While the ultimate goal will be for such a panel to be predictive in all cases, even a limited false
positive rate would facilitate assessment of radiation injury in a mass casualty scenario: e.g. a 1% false
positive rate would reduce the number of individuals needing further evaluation by 100-fold. Additionally, this
assay will be flexible as it could be enriched with biomarkers for specificity and radiation quality. This
application also combines the engineering experience and capabilities of our collaborators to further develop
pre-processing devices with the intention of stabilizing the sample during transport to a clinical facility. The
materials to be fabricated will also aim to enrich the biosignature for the radiation-related metabolites and
extract them effectively from small amounts of a biofluid (urine, serum, whole blood, saliva), transported as a
stable dry membrane. Assembly of such materials in a 96 well plate will further decrease the sample
preparation time and minimize human error associated with sample preparation. Our unique approach to
combine LC-MS/MS applications with pre-processing materials will aim to move this technology from the
feasibility stage to technology development, satisfying the needs for rapid methods for radiation injury
assessment."
11059725,"Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI, chemobrain), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) and gait changes are debilitating side-effects of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin),
taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian malignancies.
Over 70% of women report experiencing CRCI, CIPN and/or falls during treatment or after completion, impairing
their quality of life. These neurotoxic impairments can also compromise treatment with cisplatin, influencing
 disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA-approved clinical interventions for the treatment of CRCI and
CIPN. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced neuronal toxicity derives from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage,
and oxidative stress, which induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary data show that in vitro
pharmacological inhibition with small molecule inhibitors, i.e., neflamapimod for p38MAPK and SP600125 for
JNK, prevents cisplatin-induced reduction in dendritic spine branching and density. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that inhibition of the p38MAPK/JNK pathways will prevent cisplatin-induced neuronal
apoptosis and damage, leading to attenuation of cognitive impairments, gait changes, and neuropathic
pain associated with CRCI and CIPN. In this project, we propose to determine if: (1) cisplatin-induced p38
MAPK/JNK signaling underlies structural and functional neuronal damage, using in vitro pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA silencing; (2) neflamapimod and SP600125 prevent cisplatin-induced neuropathy and gait
alterations in the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer in C57BL/6 mice and the transgenic breast cancer
model C3TAg in FVBN mice; and (3) cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by p38MAPK/JNK inhibition
without compromising its anti-cancer activity. Our Approach includes in vitro analysis of 2 separate neuronal cell
 lines, behavioral analysis using sensory testing for CIPN, testing of cognitive impairment, and novel
MouseWalker for gait changes in female mice using the two mouse cancer models. The proposed studies will
demonstrate the role of the p38MAPK and JNK in cisplatin induced CRCI/CIPN, and translational potential for
novel strategies to treat CRCI and CIPN. Due to health disparities, women suffer more disproportionately from
cancer and pain-related treatment than men. Therefore, testing our hypothesis in female mice is expected to
significantly advance the understanding and treatment of cisplatin-induced neurotoxic side effects and improve
the quality of life for women with cancer. Nevertheless, we expect that these findings may also apply to cisplatin-
 induced neurotoxicity in males and to other cancers than ovarian and breast cancers."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The most commonly used illicit stimulant in HIV-infected individuals is methamphetamine (MA), and prior
studies demonstrate strong evidence that MA promotes increased HIV transcription as well as immune
dysregulation. HIV cure has emerged as an important clinical and research priority given evidence of ongoing
immune dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). A challenge in
achieving worldwide HIV eradication is targeting specific vulnerable populations who are most likely to benefit
from an HIV cure but possess poorer immune responses as a result of residual viral replication due to
suboptimal ART adherence and/or direct immune dysfunction from illicit substance use. Prior non-human
studies demonstrate that MA directly induces HIV production and promotes immune activation and
inflammation. These preclinical findings suggest that HIV+ individuals who use MA may experience greater
immune dysfunction and face additional challenges for future HIV eradication. The experiments of this
R61/R33 proposal will investigate the effects of long-term and short-term MA exposure in HIV+ ART-
suppressed individuals with a history of MA use. In Aim 1, HIV+ ART-suppressed participants with current MA
use will be enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to determine the effects of long-term MA exposure on
residual virus production, gene expression, inflammation, and trace amine-associated 1 (TAAR1, a promising
drug target for psychostimulant addiction) signaling. In Aim 2, HIV+ infected ART-suppressed individuals with a
prior history of non-dependent MA use will be enrolled in an interventional study where they will be
administered oral methamphetamine to determine the effects of short-term MA exposure on residual virus
production, gene expression, inflammation, and TAAR1 signaling. MA exposure will be quantified in Aim 1 with
hair samples, and in Aim 2 with multiple plasma samples collected over a 24-hour monitoring period. Measures
of MA exposure will then be associated with residual virus production (HIV-1 cell-associated unspliced and
multiply spliced RNA, and, as a marker of recent production – episomal 2-LTR DNA), gene expression
(validated by flow cytometry for protein expression), TAAR1 signaling (urinary β-PEA levels), and inflammation
(plasma interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and transforming growth factor-β). Using this
approach, we will then functionally validate the top 60 genes identified in Aims 1 and 2 using a powerful gene
editing technique (CRISPR-Cas9) using primary HIV+ CD4+ T cells. The proposed study will be the first
human genetic study to directly evaluate the effect of MA exposure on residual viral transcription during
effective ART. The overall goals of the study are to integrate a rigorous clinical study designs with high
throughput `omics data to identify novel targets for reversing HIV latency, reducing inflammation, and
personalizing future therapeutic strategies specific to HIV+ ART-suppressed individuals who use MA."
11070423,"Obesity prevalence in youth with spina bifida (SB) is reported as high as 74%, dramatically higher than their
typically developing (TD) peers at 16.9%. Obesity is associated with life-long medical, psychological and
economic burdens. In SB, obesity further limits one’s independence and ability to self-manage health as well
as places them at risk for secondary obesity-related comorbidities. Accurate measurement of body fat is critical
as higher levels are associated with increased health risks. Once body fat is established, knowledge of the
individual’s total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is essential to determine an individual’s recommended daily
caloric intake needed to maintain or change body weight. Successful identification, prevention and/or treatment
of obesity is severely compromised by the lack of: 1) a clinically feasible, cost-effective and valid method to
measure body fat, and 2) data on TDEE of youth with SB. Inherent characteristics of SB complicate the ability
to accurately measure height, to identify body fat and are associated with a decreased energy expenditure. In
addition, a Body Mass Index (BMI), commonly used in clinics as a surrogate estimate of body fat to screen for
obesity is inaccurate when used in SB. Proposals for alternative measures or methods to accurately identify
body fat in individuals with SB have been made, but have yet to be tested in a sufficiently large sample. To
address these gaps, we will develop two independent methods and/or algorithms for use in youth with SB, one
to model body fat in a clinic environment and one to predict TDEE in order to determine daily caloric intake
recommendations. This multisite, cross-sectional study will include 232 youth with SB, ages 5-18 (stratified by
age and mobility status). Sites include four pediatric SB programs from different geographical regions.
Participants will have four body composition measures (waist circumference, four-site skinfolds, bioelectrical
impedance analysis, and Doubly Labeled Water [DLW]) and up to five height measures (standing [if able to
stand independently], arm span, recumbent, knee height and ulnar length) performed. DLW analysis and
calculations will provide the criterion body fat%, fat-free mass and TDEE. The body composition and/or height
measures will be used to develop an algorithm that accurately models body fat% and categorizes weight status
of youth with SB. Based on the average TDEE, an algorithm will be developed to predict energy requirements
with a best-fit model based on fat-free mass, sex, age, ambulation status height and/or weight. In addition, a
nutrition and physical activity screener will be employed to describe the dietary intake and patterns of physical
activity in youth with SB. The proposed study aligns with the mission and research goals of NICHD by ensuring
that all children have the opportunity for healthy and productive lives by optimizing independence and
promoting the health of populations at an increased risk for obesity by generating findings to be used in the
creation and testing of weight management interventions."

Signaling molecules and their receptors rely on endo-lysosomal trafficking to prevent their accumulation on the
plasma membrane, which would perturb craniofacial development. The ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Com-
plexes Required for Transport) multiprotein machinery is recruited to endosomal membranes for the degrada-
tion of such endosomal cargoes. However, ESCRT functions during vertebrate development are poorly under-
stood. We isolated a mouse line carrying an ENU-induced hypomorphic mutation of the ESCRT-II-encoding
gene Vps25, Vps25ENU. Vps25ENU/ENU homozygous embryos exhibit polydactyly with hyperactivation of the fi-
broblast growth factor (FGF)-sonic hedgehog (SHH) feedback loop. We uncovered that: 1) ESCRT-encoding
genes, including Vps25, are expressed in both cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived mesenchyme and epithelium
and enriched in select craniofacial domains; 2) Vps25ENU/ENU embryos exhibit severe craniofacial defects, in-
cluding branchial arch 1 (BA1)-derived structures; 3) FGF and SHH signaling are unperturbed in Vps25ENU/ENU
heads, unlike in limbs; 4) Vps25 cephalic epithelium- and CNC-specific loss, obtained using our new Vps25
conditional allele, phenocopy the craniofacial defects of Vps25ENU/ENU mutants; 5) select head domains of
Vps25ENU/ENU embryos exhibit alterations of sphingolipid metabolism that are unaffected in mutant limbs; and 6)
perturbations of lipid-synthesizing enzymes occur in both head epithelium and mesenchyme of Vps25ENU/ENU
BA1, including upregulation of the Serine Palmitoyl Transferase (SPT) enzymatic complex critical for sphin-
golipid synthesis. Thus, we hypothesize that the ESCRT machinery executes tissue-specific roles during mam-
malian development by differentially regulating select signaling and metabolic pathways in discrete embryonic
domains. We will address our hypothesis through these aims: 1) Determine whether the contributions of
VPS25/ESCRT-II to mammalian craniofacial morphogenesis are tissue-specific. Using our conditional al-
lele, we will assess whether VPS25 regulates the same or different signaling pathways in the murine cephalic
epithelium and mesenchyme. 2) Characterize ESCRT-II-mediated dysregulation of lipid metabolism in
Vps25-deficient embryos. We will assess tissue-specific lipid distribution and levels in Vps25ENU/ENU embry-
onic heads versus limbs and will identify specific lipid species that are perturbed in Vps25-deficient heads by
lipidomic analysis of BA1 tissue. 3) Establish if ESCRT-II-dependent perturbation of lipid metabolism is
causative of the craniofacial defects of Vps25-deficient embryos. We will determine whether pharmaco-
logic downregulation of SPT rescues, even partially, the craniofacial defects of Vps25 mutants. As SPT activity
is negatively regulated by ORMDL proteins, we will assess in genetic interaction experiments if the head phe-
notype of embryos with enhanced SPT activity due to loss of Ormdl3 on a Vps25ENU/+ background phenocopies
that of homozygous Vps25ENU/ENU embryos. The novel ESCRT-dependent regulators identified will be har-
nessed to design new strategies for molecular diagnosis and repair of abnormal craniofacial morphogenesis."

To enable deformation of the skull during birth and allow for the rapid growth of the brain during early life
stages, the bones of the skull roof are connected through fibrous tissue, called sutures. These sutures only
fully fuse later in life to form a stable brain case. Early fusion of these fibrous connections is called
craniosynostosis and leads to deformations of the skull, which in turn can lead to increased cranial pressure
and restricted brain growth. Craniosynostosis is the second most common craniofacial birth defect, occurring
with a frequency of 1 in 2100-2500 live birth. Craniosynostosis often occur isolated, without additional
malformations, but in 20-25% of cases patients show additional changes like midface hypoplasia and limb
abnormalities (syndromic craniosynostosis). Despite the relatively high incidence, the pathomechanisms
leading to craniosynostosis are still incompletely understood and surgical removal of the fused tissue is the
current standard of care. These surgical procedures bear a risk of high blood loss, and the sutures often re-fuse
requiring repeated surgeries. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the pathomechanisms
leading to craniosynostosis to enable the development of alternative, non-surgical treatment strategies. The
zebrafish has become a popular animal model to study human disease and it has been shown that the patterning
of the skull roof as well as the regulatory pathways controlling craniofacial development are highly conserved. In
a genetic screen for mutants with skeletal phenotypes, we have identified a unique mutant that exhibits features
of a severe form of syndromic craniosynostosis with coronal suture fusion, midface hypoplasia, open fontanelles,
fewer teeth, deformed and shorter fin rays and mis-pattered scales. To establish a correlation of the observed
mutant phenotype to the human disease, we will perform comprehensive phenotypic, mechanistic and genetic
evaluation of our novel mutant. In Aim1 we will perform skeletal staining on developmental time series to identify
which stages and skeletal elements are affected in combination with analyses of shape and bone density
changes through micro computed tomography scanning. In a second set of experiments, we will use in vivo
labeling of the growing bones to determine bone formation dynamics of forming skull bones. Finally, we will
determine the mechanical properties of the developing sutures and calvarial bones. In the second aim, we will
define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the CRS phenotype using immunohistochemistry,
transcriptomic and phospho-protein analyses. The third aim will identify the genetic changes responsible for
these severe skeletal phenotypes. We will use CRISPR mediated genome editing to functionally test previously
identified candidate genes and determine their expression pattern. A detailed and broad description of the
phenotypic changes occurring in our craniosynostosis mutant in combination with the mechanistic and genetic
analyses, will serve as a starting point to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
craniosynostosis and hopefully enable the development of non-surgical strategies strategies in the future."

The escalating use of kratom, an herbal substance with opioid-like properties, has raised significant public health
concerns due to its potential for abuse and dependence. Despite a drastic increase in calls to poison control
centers regarding kratom-related incidents, human laboratory studies investigating its abuse potential are
lacking. The overall objective of this application is to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation
of the abuse potential and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of kratom in humans. The study will employ a rigorous,
randomized, double-blind, crossover design involving non-treatment seeking recreational opioid users (n=60).
Participants will complete 1 of 6 pre-specified treatment sequences according to a balanced 6 x 6 Latin square
design; each dosing sequence consists of 6 dosing periods that evaluate the abuse potential of 1 of the 6 study
treatments, including kratom at different doses, positive control drugs, and placebo. The primary objective is to
determine whether kratom elicits subjective effects distinct from those produced by the controls, utilizing
standardized visual analog scales (VAS) to assess “drug liking” and other subjective measures. Additionally, the
project seeks to characterize the PK profile of kratom following oral administration, focusing on parameters such
as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination kinetics. Blood samples will be collected at specified
intervals to analyze kratom and its major metabolites, correlating these findings with subjective and
physiological effects over time. The anticipated outcomes of this research include valuable insights into the abuse
potential and risks associated with kratom use, informing regulatory decisions regarding its scheduling and
labeling. By providing comprehensive PK data on kratom, this research will contribute to a better understanding
of its pharmacological profile and aid in safeguarding public health against the potential harms of kratom misuse
and abuse."

Cirrhosis is the end-result of chronic liver disease mainly viral hepatitis, metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis, and alcohol-related liver disease. The only life-saving treatment for decompensated cirrhosis is
liver transplant (LT). Despite the critical need for this lifesaving therapy, there remain significant inequities in
accessing LT. While a myriad disparities and barriers exist in the LT care pathway, the largest number of
patients in the pathway are in the community awaiting the first step-referral. Previous studies have revealed
disparities in LT referrals, with lower odds for Black individuals (OR, 0.19), the uninsured (OR, 0.40), and
specific hospital sites (OR, 0.40). Nationally, the waitlist capture rate for decompensated cirrhosis was 0.4 for
White individuals and 0.3 for Black individuals; in Indiana, the ratio was only 0.2, ranking in the bottom 5% of
all states. At Indiana University Health (IUH), the sole LT center in Indiana, only 5.8% of LT referrals were Black
individuals, and less than 1% were Hispanic/Latino/a/x ethnicity.
Many patients experiencing health disparities seek medical care at community gastroenterology (GI) practices
where clinicians may not have access to transplant hepatologists and may lack knowledge of specialized
evidence-based protocols and policies. This is exacerbated by factors like limited provider time, potential
biases, complexities in navigating the healthcare system, and differing levels of patient literacy and unmet
social needs, all of which impede referral. Furthermore, there is variability among community GI practices,
including size (i.e. small vs. large) and location (i.e. rural vs. urban), directly impacting the resources available
and the capacity to support both providers and patients through the referral process. There is an urgent and
unmet need to develop an intervention that addresses this variability but also acknowledges the structural and
social barriers faced by patients and caregivers, ultimately improving referral equity. There is currently no
multilevel intervention addressing the lack of equitable access to LT. The study team proposes to adapt
LT-CARE, a multi-component referral toolkit to address barriers at multiple socioecological levels and improve
equity in LT referral. The study team will use community-based research methods to adapt a usable,
acceptable, and feasible toolkit for community GI practices, their patients, and caregivers."

The US is currently on pace to fall short of achieving the goals set by the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative
launched by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2019. A growing body of research suggests that
the root causes of EHE's striking lack of progress are structural racism and social stratification that leads to
poverty. Housing instability — a lack of stable, secure, and adequate housing that results from poverty and
structural racism — is a major social determinant of health (SDOH). The Philadelphia Department of Health
(PDPH) estimates that 4,000 people with HIV (PWH) experience housing instability in Philadelphia. While the
National HIV/AIDS strategy specifically calls for approaches to address SDOH (including through the
development and scaling up of housing interventions), the vast majority of EHE efforts continue to focus on
facilitating healthcare access and uptake. There have been few rigorous evaluations of housing interventions for
PWH, and even fewer during the modern era of universal treatment for HIV. In close partnership with the PDPH,
we will rigorously evaluate a potentially transformative city-level transitional housing program for PWH
experiencing housing instability (“Arms Around You” or AAY), leveraging lottery drawings from a waitlist to
estimate causal effects. The program will be implemented by PDPH in 2024 and scaled up in the coming years
(~200 anticipated enrollments during the first several years). AAY includes (1) intensive housing counseling, (2)
housing medical case management, and (3) full rent payment support for 48 months (or longer if needed). We
will use mixed methods to collect quantitative (survey data, pharmacy refill data, and PDPH surveillance/program
data) and qualitative (key stakeholder interviews) data. If the AAY screening period begins before this proposal's
full review by NIH, we have pilot funding from PDPH to collect baseline data. Since PDPH's lottery drawing is
necessitated by high anticipated demand (PDPH estimates there are 4,000 PWH in Philadelphia experiencing
housing instability) and limited initial availability (~200 available spots during the first few years), we will be able
to estimate the long-term effects of the program on health, economic, and psychological outcomes. In addition
to studying mechanisms through which housing interventions affect health outcomes, we will use implementation
science methods to assess program acceptability, reach, sustainment, and costs to inform scalability to other
cities. This proposal is innovative in that we will capitalize on a unique opportunity to use rigorous causal and
implementation science methodology to evaluate the health and non-health effects of a population-level large-
scale housing intervention that addresses an important SDOH. This approach could significantly impact both
HIV- and non-HIV-related outcomes, such as viral suppression, ART adherence, engagement in care, substance
use, financial well-being, housing security, food security, psychological distress, hope, and future orientation.
This study will provide critical evidence to policymakers at a time when many cities are considering housing
support programs and various other anti-poverty interventions (e.g., guaranteed income)."

research in cutaneous immunology. To complete my research objectives, I will gain and extend
expertise in clinical/translational research, computational biology, neurobiology, and the clinical
care of patients afflicted by the devastating and poorly understood skin disease Hidradenitis
Suppurativa (HS). I present preliminary data showing that isolated activation of cutaneous
TRPV1-nociceptors, which transduce pain signals through unmyelinated sensory afferents, is
sufficient to induce expression of IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and IL-23 and expand IL-17-producing CD4+
T cells in skin. I show that the TRPV1+-nerve-derived neuropeptides CGRP and Substance P
(SP) enhance human skin dendritic cell (DC) responsiveness to toll-like receptor stimulation.
Finally, I demonstrate that blockade of neuropeptide release with botulinum toxin reduces T cell
density in the skin of HS patients to improve disease control. In Aim 1, I propose to more
precisely characterize the immune cells infiltrating the pilosebaceous unit in HS skin using a
highly innovative spatial transcriptomic technology. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that inhibiting
neuropeptide activity with botulinum toxin reduces IL-17 and TNF production in skin. Aim 3 will
evaluate the functional outcome of SP and CGRP signaling in skin using in vitro assays and
single cell RNA-sequencing analyses of HS skin explants treated with neuropeptide or vehicle.
Together, these aims will test our central hypothesis that neurogenic inflammation heightens
cDC2 sensitivity to microbial products to induce aberrant Type-17 inflammation. It is our
expectation that these experiments will implicate neurogenic inflammation in the pathogenesis
of HS and serve as proof-of-concept for clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of nociceptor
inhibition in reduction of inflammation, relief of pain, and improvement in quality of life for HS
patients. My work will proceed under close advisement from my primary mentor, Dr. Daniel
Kaplan, co-mentor Dr. Robert Lafyatis, and scientific advisors with expertise in areas that fill key
gaps in my previous training. I have an environment of enduring support from my mentors,
department, and institution which has nationally recognized strength in translational research.
With support from this mentored award, these studies will yield the preliminary data needed for
a competitive R01 application and successfully launch an independent career."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. Dr. Snyder’s OMF R01, “Visualizing tumor heterogeneity in an immune intact and autochthonous mouse
model of breast cancer” has approximately two years remaining on the award. The objective of this parent award,
is to recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of HER2 oncogenes in a genetically tractable model more closely
resembling the human condition – including an intact immune system and stromal network. Our approach has
been to validate a Cancer rainbow (Crainbow) mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer to visualize wildtype (WT),
the splice-isoform exon 16 null isoform (d16), and the N-terminally truncated null isoform (p95). The parent R01
award is broadly demonstrating heterogeneity of tumor cell states, immune responses, fibroblast cross-talk, and
the effects of HER2-targeted therapy. New preliminary data show that HER2 Crainbow isoforms differ in their
metastatic potential and their primary tumor cell lines are also associated with distinct dormancy states including
expression of the dormancy marker, NR2F1. Additional, preliminary support shows that the HER2 Crainbow cell
lines differ in their intrinsic ability to evade the immune system. This collaborative supplement supports testing
the hypothesis that p95 cells express gene signatures characterized by NR2F1 dormancy and Nectin2 immune
checkpoint to promote metastatic potential and immune escape of dormant tumor cells. Two specific aims are
proposed that will in (Aim 1) Determine the role of NR2F1 overexpression in dormancy and dissemination of p95
HER2 expressing tumor cells and in (Aim 2) Determine a role for Nectin2/3 in promoting immune escape in
dormant p95 tumor cells. Dr. Bravo-Cordero’s expertise is necessary for the proposed intravital imaging studies
and his expertise in tumor dormancy signaling. Already, our team has initial studies and established Crainbow
cell lines and Crainbow mouse models at Dr. Bravo-Cordero’s laboratory. Therefore, the proposed supplement
is already “shovel-ready” and has a high likelihood of success. The expected outcome of this supplement is
three-fold: i) The supplement will continue to validate the HER2 Crainbow modeling technology as an important
tool for visualizing tumor heterogeneity in immune intact models. ii) The supplement will also provide necessary
resources for continuing to foster an early collaborative relationship between Drs. Snyder and Bravo-Cordero by
providing time and funds to complete a manuscript and then apply for subsequent collaborative project grants.
iii). The supplement will also provide important funding for demonstrating a new molecular mechanism that
induces dormancy and promotes immune escape. Overall, this will provide an exciting strategy for promoting
immune recognition of dormant tumor cells and thereby preventing or treating metastatic cancers."
11070274,"Achieving the necessary, robust and continually evolving evidence base for genomic medicine and its
implementation in clinical practice requires overcoming many practical and logistical challenges. The
Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE (IGNITE) Network has been and will continue to be strategic in identifying
and disseminating solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we will continue to address the absence of
supporting information technology infrastructure, lack of data standards and interoperability, and insufficient
decision support. The effectiveness of IGNITE in achieving its objectives requires an experienced, and well-
organized coordination center (CC) with strong existing ties to genomic medicine, that can recruit participants,
create a vast resource of best practices for pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs), develop and deploy common
measures and standards, identify solutions to challenges in implementation, develop a platform for data
management and data analysis, and disseminate knowledge to the greater community. The proposed IGNITE
II CC, a partnership between the Duke University Center for Applied Genomics and Precision Medicine and the
Duke Clinical Research Institute, will provide a central resource for coordination, cost-effective PCT design,
adaptation, oversight, and integration for the network. Importantly, we will leverage our successful
leadership of the IGNITE I Administrative CC and our deep expertise in coordination of PCTs. The
members of the CC have notable experience in each area required by the RFA as: 1) a demonstration project
AND Administrative CC for IGNITE I, 2) CC for large networks and genomic medicine studies, and 3) CC for
PCTs. The IGNITE II CC will provide strategic organizational leadership for the development of a novel,
flexible, and adaptable genomic medicine PCT platform, enables seamless communication, sharing of
information to optimize network productivity. The CC will ensure optimal and adaptable PCT design, participant
recruitment, and data collection, develop a comprehensive analysis framework for evaluating the
implementation and clinical effectiveness of the genomic medicine interventions, and help disseminate of
knowledge beyond the network. In addition, the CC will innovate in 1) the implementation of pragmatic trial
designs, electronic data capture (EDC) systems, and improved recruitment strategies, 2) institution of common
measures across the network, 3) creative management of affiliates as a force amplifier for the network, 4)
developing a Genomic Medicine Knowledge Base for dissemination, 4) creating a durable longitudinal data
source from IGNITE participants and 5) developing a focus on sustainability. Our team's unparalleled track
record of collaborative genomic medicine research and nationally recognized expertise in coordinating IGNITE
I, large networks, and PCTs uniquely positions us to facilitate the completion of high-impact genomic medicine

Rare diseases (RD) and disorders collectively affect about 25 million Americans. RD research
and care face common challenges, including: 1) insufficient knowledge about the etiology,
pathophysiology, natural history and epidemiology of the diseases; 2) inadequate or non-
uniform case definition and disease classification systems that make diagnosis and
epidemiologic assessment difficult; 3) insufficient understanding of the determinants of multiple
phenotypes and the relationships between genetic variance and phenotypic manifestations; 4)
rarity and geographic dispersion of cases that hampers both access to qualified care and
participation in research; 5) a dearth of clinically proven, safe and effective treatments; and 6)
inadequate private investment into RD research and treatment. In the U.S., the Rare Diseases
Act of 2002 authorizes the Office of Rare Disease Research to recommend a research agenda
and promote coordination and cooperation among research programs. The Rare Diseases
Clinical Research Consortia (RDCRC) that comprise the Rare Diseases Clinical Research
Network (RDCRN) advance the diagnosis, management, and treatment of RDs to enhance
clinical trial readiness. The RDCRN Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) must
provide state-of-the-art informatics, statistical and epidemiological expertise in clinical research
study design and data management technology and processes, in order to guarantee the
production of evidence that can support the progression of clinical and translational research
(CTR) from Phase I through Phase III trials to adoption within standard clinical practice. To
achieve the goal of enhancing clinical trial readiness throughout the RDCRN, we will establish
the DMCC at Cincinnati Children’s and the University of Cincinnati with the following Specific
Aims: 1): To advance the methods and the practice of RD CTR; 2) To develop and maintain a
leading-edge, shared knowledge base for RD CTR; and 3) To establish the RDCRN as a
globally connected resource for improving RD CTR across the entire RD ecosystem. We expect
to accomplish these Aims by promoting collaboration and trial readiness, engaging patients and
families, and creating an “Esprit de Corps” for the RDCRN, through the adoption of Learning
System principles. Our proposed DMCC brings a unique combination of world-class expertise,
outstanding infrastructure, state-of-the-art technology and enthusiastic institutional support. This
winning combination will accelerate scientific discovery and understanding across the network,
which will bring new treatment options to trial, ultimately translating into improved health and
wellness for RD patients and their families worldwide."
11066766,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Aphasia is commonly operationalized as a linguistic impairment affecting expressive or receptive
language. People with aphasia (PWA) often experience profound emotional disturbances to a greater extent
than post-stroke adults without aphasia given the direct relationship between emotional well-being and the
capacity to engage in human interaction. PWA have been reported to develop ‘linguistic anxiety’, or stress when
using language, due to the preoccupation with communication breakdown opportunities. Acute stress can be
adaptive and inform our bodies of when to avoid or escape danger. However, persistent episodes of stress (i.e.,
chronic stress) can have adverse effects on physical and mental health. Chronic stress may also lead to harmful
changes in the body’s neurological function, which may, in turn, interfere with language rehabilitative outcomes.
Given the direct relationship between chronic stress, well-being, and rehabilitation, there is a critical need to
better understand sources of stress related to communication in PWA to inform clinical practice and interventions.
 In line with NIDCD’s mission, the study plans to explore perceptions of stress concerning communication
in PWA to enhance long-term outcomes and promote communicative participation. This will be achieved by
conducting a mixed methods research paradigm to explore sources and self-management strategies of chronic
stress in PWA. PWA will complete patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and semi-structured interview
prompts related to sources of stress that may impact communication participation. To our knowledge, this project
will be the first to directly examine the lived experiences of PWA through a mixed methods research paradigm
to identify candidate sources of chronic stress in relation to communication (Aim 1a). Next, we will collect PROMs
and interview prompts to elucidate the self-management strategies used to reduce perceptions of stress during
communication attempts. While self-management strategies can be adaptive, we suspect PWA will endorse
recruiting maladaptive strategies, such as avoidance or excessive rehearsal, that may suppress acute stress but
facilitate long-term stress toward the feared situation (Aim 2a). Finally, we will collect longitudinal stress and
coping data via ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), or repeated real-time data sampling, for the first
time in PWA. Data collected via EMAs are suspected to provide a better insight into the variation of stress and
coping perceptions from day to day. (Aim 1b and 2b). Potential moderating variables (i.e., socioeconomic status,
physical immobility) will be accounted for in the proposed project. The findings of this study will provide critical
information to inform future interventions that address chronic stress as it impedes communicative participation.
 The fellowship training plan will take place at a large, research-intensive university under the direction of
a strong, systematically selected mentorship team. Training will include formularized courses, independent
studies, workshops, and conferences to enhance background in the neurophysiology of chronic stress, analytics,
research ethics, and scientific dissemination."

Flavor is perhaps the most important determinant of eating habits—we eat foods that taste good and avoid foods
that taste bad. Because eating habits are directly linked to nutrition and health, altering flavor perception is a
prime target for interventions aimed at steering people toward heathier food choice. Flavor includes well-understood gustatory qualities (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, umami). However, a substantial portion of flavor
constitutes olfactory (smell) qualities (try taking a sip of wine or eating a jellybean candy while pinching your
nose). The gustatory and olfactory sensory systems that contribute to flavor each have unique characteristics.
Hedonic perception of gustatory signals is innate and relatively stable (e.g., from birth into adulthood, sweet is
liked, bitter disliked). In contrast, olfactory processing tends to be highly plastic, suggesting a strong opportunity
to alter flavor perception through interventions. This proposal will gain basic understanding of the relationship
between flavor-related odor perception and eating habits. I focus on children 4-6 years of age, because this
constitutes a developmental period during which eating habits are formed for life, making it a particularly
promising target for interventions. In Specific Aim 1, I will characterize the contribution of olfaction to multiple
aspects of flavor perception in children and adults using a novel adaptation of a simple, non-verbal rating
procedure, as well as analysis of video recordings of facial expressions. Preliminary data suggest that perception
of olfactory flavor components (but not gustatory flavor components) undergoes substantial developmental
changes. I will determine the extent to which differences in smell perception between children and adults can be
explained by exposure to specific foods, as measured by a modified food frequency questionnaire and a non-verbal identification task. In Specific Aim 2, I will determine how individual differences in flavor perception among
children relate to weight status. In order to development effective nutritional interventions, we must consider the
relationship between weight status and flavor perception. Although this relationship has not been examined
among young children, there is substantial evidence that overweight/obesity is associated with impairments in
flavor sensitivity among adults. By conducting a regression analyses between BMI-for-age and perceptual
measures for taste and smell, I will be able to determine whether this relationship emerges as early as ages 4-6. The results will provide novel mechanistic insight into how sensory processing interacts with flavor exposure
and weight status during early childhood."

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are the most common neurodegenerative brain disease
and characterized by massive loss of memory and learning. AD/ADRD affects more than 6 million Americans
and puts a heavy burden on caregivers in society. However, effective treatment of AD/ADRD is still lacking.
While randomized clinical trials (RCT) can provide reliable evidence on the effectiveness of interventions, they
also have inherent limitations including high cost and long execution time. In addition, RCTs usually are
conducted on selected populations and in specialized environments with limited follow up time. Therefore, they
could have limitations in generalizability to real-world clinical practice. Clinical trial simulation is becoming an
effective approach to assess feasibility, investigate assumptions, and refine study protocols before conducting
the actual trials. Increased availability and granularity of real-world data (RWD) such as electronic health record
(EHR) and medical claims data along with advances in data science offer untapped opportunities to leverage
RWD for trial simulation studies to generate real world evidence (RWE). Nevertheless, there are methodological
barriers and informatics challenges in supporting RWD-based trial simulation studies, especially for AD: (1)
clinical trials need to be represented using a formal and standard approach (i.e., ontologies) to capture the entire
scope of a trial, especially eligibility criteria and outcome measures (i.e., both effectiveness and safety); (2) such
formal and standard representation needs to be made interoperable with RWD standards (e.g., common data
models) to identify study cohorts and relevant, important patient characteristics (i.e., via computable phenotypes
and natural language processing [NLP] methods as rich AD-related information such as cognitive scores often
exist in unstructured clinical notes); and (3) comprehensive and reusable pipelines need to be implemented that
can seamlessly align with existing large-scale RWD for generating high-quality analytic-ready datasets for AD
clinical trial simulation studies. To address these barriers, we propose create and pilot test the ACTS
(Alzheimer's disease Clinical Trial Simulation) system, leveraging three large collections of RWD (~20 million
patients from the OneFlorida network, UT Physician Clinical Data Research Warehouse, and the Optum’s
Clinformatics data). Specifically, we propose to develop novel informatics approaches to represent the entirety
of AD trials while considering the connection of RWD (Aim 1), to use both structured and unstructured RWD to
develop robust phenotyping algorithms that will render previously incomputable AD study traits computable (Aim
2), and to develop the ACTS web application, which will provide an integrated environment for AD researchers
to construct virtual AD trials using an interactive web interface and obtain analytic-ready datasets for trial
simulation studies (Aim 3)."

10990176,"Pluripotent-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) remain immature in phenotype and function, and the lack of maturity has now emerged as a major concern in their clinical application. However, it remains poorly understood why PSC-CMs fail to fully mature. To address this, we have generated a high-quality, high-resolution single cell transcriptome map of endogenous CMs undergoing maturation and identified a critical window when a majority of genes change their expression levels. A direct transcriptomic integration with isogenic PSC-CMs has revealed a group of perinatal genes abnormally expressed in PSC-CMs, causing them to stall prematurely. Through comprehensive computational approaches, we further discovered a conserved gene regulatory network of dysregulated transcription factors that underlie maturation failure. In light of these findings, this project aims to test the role of the gene network in overcoming the premature arrest of PSC-CMs. This knowledge will pave the way for a transcriptome-based strategy for PSC-CM maturation, which can be leveraged towards improving clinical viability of PSC-CMs."

Stanford’s Research and Mentoring Program for Underrepresented Pre-dental students (RAMP UP) aims to create a
unified oral healthcare career program by increasing the interest of underrepresented minority (URM), first generation and
low-income (FLI) high school and community college students in oral healthcare careers. We will do so through two avenues:
1) career awareness activities during the academic school year designed to increase URM/FLI students’ interest in an oral
healthcare career and 2) through a paid, 8-week hands-on summer research internship.
RAMP UP is a partnership. Mountain View Los Altos (MVLA) school district has two programs, AVID (Advancement via
Individual Determination) and CTE (Career Technical Education), that engage a predominantly URM/FLI student body in
career awareness activities. Our partnership with MVLA provides an extensive oral healthcare-specific curricula along
coupled with hands-on workshops to high school students who participate in AVID and CTE. Thirty-two MVLA teachers
partner with 11 Stanford mentors in this academic year component of RAMP UP. These career awareness activities set the
stage for recruiting URM/FLI students to the summer research component of RAMP UP.
RAMP UP’s 8-week summer internship is modeled after- and will replace- our highly successful 21-year-old STaRS summer
research internship. Our RAMP UP 8-week, hands-on summer internship emphasizes research skill building, and their direct
application to NIDCR-funded research initiatives. DDS, PhD, and DDS/PhD mentors will serve as research guides, which pre-
dental undergraduates serving as near-peer support. Interns will be involved in cutting-edge research projects, thereby

11066767,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In real-world listening environments, individuals must integrate distinct auditory features such as pitch, onset
time, and spatial location to perceive auditory objects amidst background noise. This feature integration is
particularly important for deciphering sequential sounds with converging features, such as speech or music.
Hearing loss, especially in single-sided deafness (SSD), can disrupt feature integration leading to challenges
like impaired speech comprehension in noise. This study adapts a perceptual illusion, the auditory kappa (AK)
effect, to investigate feature integration in the healthy and impaired auditory system. In the AK effect, changes
in pitch bias relative timing judgments in sound sequences such that sequential tones that are closer in pitch
are perceived as closer in time. Leveraging this effect, we introduce the auditory spatial kappa (ASK) task to
investigate how acoustic spatial and temporal cues are integrated to bias time perception and to test the effect
of SSD on spatio-temporal feature interactions underlying auditory object perception, with and without a
cochlear implant (CI). While temporal onsets are preserved in CI signal processing, individuals with CI and
SSD face unique challenges due to impairments in spatial localization and auditory stream segregation.
Although SSD patients recover some sound localization abilities with CI, it is crucial to identify disruptions in
spatio-temporal features binding in this population. Our research objectives include establishing spatio-
temporal feature interactions in normal hearing (NH) adults and determining which cues for spatio-temporal
auditory perception are restored with CI in the SSD population. Aim 1 establishes baseline measures of spatial
biases on timing judgments in NH adults. Participants will report the relative timing of sequential sounds
presented at distinct horizontal locations. Building on our previous research studying the AK effect and
preliminary data, we predict an ASK effect where smaller spatial separations result in shorter perceived time
intervals due to auditory grouping. We hypothesize that grouping sounds based on spatial proximity biases
perceived temporal proximity. Aim 2 examines the effect of SSD on this task and determines the extent of
restored spatio-temporal feature interaction in SSD patients with CI. The ASK task will be adapted to compare
fine-grained localization and more coarse lateralization in SSD individuals with and without CI. Based on
preliminary data, we predict poor localization performance and a lack of feature interaction, measured as
perceptual bias, without CI and a bias restoration for higher frequencies with CI due to reintroduction of
bilateral interaural level cues. Findings from this research may provide an easy, objective measure of feature
integration for auditory training tasks and improve rehabilitation strategies, especially in addressing challenges
like speech comprehension in noise. Furthermore, this study will test the ASK task as an easy, quick clinical
test of spatial cue restoration for SSD-CI patients. Overall, the project contributes to advancing knowledge in
auditory perception and has potential implications for clinical applications and rehabilitation efforts."

11068124,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal tissue is the most energy consumptive tissue type of the entire body, and as such, depends heavily on
the health and proper regulation of its mitochondria, its main source of energy. Thus, mitochondrial dysfunction
is linked to a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, including the neurodevelopmental disorder Fragile X
Syndrome (FXS). FXS is characterized by loss of the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-
binding protein that has been shown to interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and components of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC). Interestingly, using an optimized Ago-CLIP method that unambiguously identifies
miRNA:target RNA interactions within the RISC, our lab has identified prevalent binding of miRNAs to
mitochondrial transcripts (mt-RNA) in the mammalian forebrain. Though mitochondrial dysfunction in FXS has
been identified, a connection with RISC and targeting of mt-RNA has not yet been explored. This proposal seeks
to further characterize the molecular underpinnings of these observed miRNA:mt-RNA interactions, as well as
their impact in both health and disease (FXS). Specific Aim 1 proposes to use the same optimized Ago-CLIP
method, termed CIMERAseq, to determine the subcellular compartment in which the miRNA:mt-RNA
interactions are occurring, as well as use a targeted approach to identify cell-type specificity of the transcript
interactions. Specific Aim 2 explores the possible functional effect of the observed binding by altering levels of
select miRNAs identified in our data and recording the effect in three ways: i) transcript abundance (via
sequencing and qPCR) ii) protein abundance (via Western blot and BN-PAGE), and iii) mitochondrial function
(via assessment of respiratory function, ATP synthesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production). Aim 2
also uses the same effect readouts to investigate mitochondrial perturbations in a mouse model of FXS (Fmr1
KO). If successful, the proposed specific aims will aid in understanding the role of miRNAs as mitochondrial gene
regulators in the mammalian forebrain, both in health and disease. In addition to completion of the proposed
aims, this proposal outlines a training plan formulated specifically for my long-term goal of becoming a well-
rounded independent scientist. Training received through the course of this fellowship will focus on enhancing
my skills in molecular biology methods, bioinformatic methods, and scientific communication and writing. My
sponsor and university, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, are outstandingly equipped to not only
allow for completion of the proposed experiments but also to provide the resources needed to receive exceptional
training in the areas described. The Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology (BCMB) program in which I
am enrolled is dedicated to providing an exceptional training environment and will support completion of the
research plan as well as career training opportunities. This fellowship will support not only impactful research
toward understanding miRNA and mitochondria in FXS pathology, but also my development into a capable and
independent neuroscientist."

Improved Targeting of Somatostatin Receptors for Pediatric Conditions
 Gigantism is a childhood developmental disorder whereby abnormally high levels of growth hormone result
in excessive growth in both height and girth. The disorder can have serious physical complications including
diabetes and loss of vision as well as social isolation. In the majority of cases gigantism is caused by pituitary
adenomas which, when surgery is not an option, is treated with somatostatin receptor agonists to suppress
growth hormone levels and provide symptom relief. Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are G protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) highly expressed in pituitary adenomas. Two analogues of the endogenous peptide,
octreotide and lanreotide, were originally developed as SSTR2-selective, long-lasting peptide therapeutics for
gigantism and other conditions. While they have proved successful, long-term side effects and other suboptimal
properties drive the need for improved pharmaceutical interventions for gigantism. Much remains unknown about
SSTRs and their pharmacology. To date, I have determined structures of SSTR2, however some questions of
subtype selectivity remain unanswered without structures of the other subtypes. Much of the additional
information about SSTR signaling partners is based upon downstream cellular assays, and much remains
unknown about the relevance of SSTR subtype selectivity and signaling partner bias. Here I propose to utilize a
combination of structural characterization with cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM), molecular dynamics
simulations, and biochemical assays in order to characterize the selectivity, activation, and signaling profiles of
SSTRs. The work will build upon my existing skillset in molecular simulations, modelling, and protein
biochemistry while providing invaluable training in cryoEM data collection/processing and cell-based biochemical
assays. Successful completion of this work will provide critical insight into the signaling landscape of the
somatostatin receptor and the structural basis for both ligand-based and SSTR-subtype-based G protein
selectivity. This will bridge several gaps in knowledge of SSTRs that should help in the development of improved,
small molecule therapeutics that do not require repeated injections in children."

In sub-Saharan Africa, low quality care at health facilities contributes to over 1 million child deaths each year.
Provider knowledge is a major contributor, but conventional provider educational methods have proven limited
due to fixed, universal content; limited geographical reach; and no refresher learning over time. Our long-term
goal is to develop a highly effective education strategy to increase provider proficiency with evidence-based
interventions that can be scaled-up worldwide. To this end, we have piloted a novel adaptive eLearning (elec-
tronic media and devices that adjust to the learner’s needs) intervention called PACE. The overall objectives of
this application are to 1) determine the effect of incorporating Tailored Skills Practice and rapid content devel-
opment process into PACE and 2) finalize an implementation strategy for PACE, including measures of pro-
vider performance and patient outcomes at all facility types in Mwanza, Tanzania. The central hypothesis is
that adaptive eLearning blended with in-person skills training that is continuously contextualized to facility
needs will increase the quality of care. Our pilot studies of PACE have shown significant improvement in pro-
vider knowledge rates, providing the rationale that adaptive eLearning represents a potential solution to over-
come known limitations of current educational methods to greatly increase the impact of education on provider
proficiency. The specific aims of our two phased approach will: 1) determine if the addition of Tailored Skills
Training increases refresher knowledge assignment completion >60% (R21); 2) determine whether rapid con-
tent development process using Tanzanian based personnel can disseminate content within 90 days (R21); 3)
Validate whether PACE implementation is feasible across all facility types (R33); and 4) Establish and validate
a system to derive provider specific pediatric admission quality of care (PAQC) scores for future PACE effec-
tiveness study. In our R21, we will recruit clinical champions to conduct Tailored Skills Practice at health cen-
ters, recruit a local content engineer (CE) and initiate quarterly meetings with multi-level leadership to continu-
ously contextualize PACE to facility needs. For the R33, we will expand PACE to all facility types and explore
generating provider specific PAQC scores using both electronic health record data extraction and prospective
clinical auditing. Our innovative mixed methods approach will provide a significant framework for the optimal
integration of eLearning into tailored skills trainings and clinical auditing for providers in LMICs. Development
of an effective pediatric acute care provider education strategy and system to derive provider level perfor-
mance and patient outcome metrics will build a foundation for a large-scale implementation study in Tanzania.
If successful, this work will improve child global health significantly and broadly advance our knowledge and
understanding of provider education and quality of care worldwide."
11062634,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over our lifetime, we learn hundreds of ‘rules’ that define how we should act in a given situation. For example,
when in a restaurant, we follow a set of rules that guide the way we order, eat, and pay for a meal. By learning
and using rules, we can optimize our behavior and maximize social and physical rewards. Disrupting one’s ability
to learn and follow rules can be pathological. Such disruptions are associated with many neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and dementia, where they carry high social and economic
costs. To develop novel, mechanistically-informed, treatments for these diseases, we must first develop a
detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that support rules.
Here, we aim to understand how the brain flexibly learns, follows, and switches between several different rules.
Combining large-scale, multi-region electrophysiology with novel behavioral paradigms in monkeys, we will study
two aspects of flexible rule-based behavior:
First, one must be able to discover which rule to follow in a new situation. This requires integrating information
from the world to decide which rule, from a set of known rules, is the correct one for the situation. Our first aim
will leverage our large-scale recording techniques to distinguish hypotheses about the relative role of prefrontal
cortex, parietal cortex, and basal ganglia in integrating feedback and deciding which rule to follow.
Second, we aim to understand how multiple rules are learned, represented, and executed. Specifically, we will
test hypotheses that the representation of rules is structured: computationally similar rules use similar neural
mechanisms. Such structure is theorized to allow us to rapidly learn new rules in new situations. To this end,
monkeys will learn and perform multiple, computationally-related, rules. In our second aim, we will use a
combination of chronic and acute electrophysiology to track the neural representation of a rule through
learning. This will distinguish hypotheses about how the neural representation of a rule is structured, and how it
relates to other, similar, rules. In parallel, our third aim will use the same recordings to understand how rules
act on stimulus representations to transform them into rule-appropriate responses. We will test three theories
of cognitive control, including a novel dynamic model that hypothesizes rules act by dynamically transforming
neural representations between subspaces of neural activity.
While our proposed research is basic in nature, we believe it is an important first step in a mechanistic
understanding of the core cognitive deficits of several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia. We believe
this understanding will improve mental health by leading to new diagnostics and treatments for cognitive
disorders. In particular, we hope to use our results to develop physiological markers that will improve detection,
allow for earlier intervention, and guide targeted treatments."

Cartilage supports skeletal development from embryos to adulthood. It also serves as an essential skeletal
component of a functional adult skeletal system. Cartilage malformation or degenerative cartilage disease,
most notably osteoarthritis, significantly affects the lifespan, quality of life, and productivity of a large proportion
of the population world-wide. As life expectancy rises, the personal and economic consequences of these
conditions are expected to increase. Since there is an unmet need for treatment and prevention of cartilage
diseases, linking expertise from different research disciplines and career stages is of utmost importance. This
is a request to support the 2025 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and associated, preceding Gordon
Research Seminar (GRS) on Cartilage Biology and Pathology, which will be held at the Sheraton Fairplex
Hotel & Conference Center, Pomona, California, March 22-28, 2025. The GRC will cover broad basic and
translational research topics with the theme of “Genes, Molecules and Mechanics in Musculoskeletal Tissue
Development and Disease”. The overall goal is to foster collaborations that will ultimately lead to novel
treatments. The 2025 conference is the 11th in the series and owes its success to three major principles. First,
it is the only conference that brings together basic science researchers, clinician-scientists, and biomedical
engineers to cover a broad spectrum of cartilage biology, pathology, and other disciplines relevant to cartilage
research. Second, the program emphasizes unpublished cutting-edge findings, state-of-the-art technologies,
and open discussions. Third, it is open to researchers at all career stages and encourages mentoring,
networking, and collaboration among young, and senior investigators. The 2025 Cartilage GRC will highlight
recent advances and challenges in understanding cartilage biology and disease. The program alternates
between formal presentations, poster sessions and informal discussions. Attendance is limited to 200
participants to promote collegial interactions. Established scientists and talented new investigators will report
and discuss their most recent exciting findings and provide insights into challenges towards understanding
cartilage biology, disease, and therapeutic approaches. Interdisciplinary collaborations are fostered through a
broad base of session topics in an intimate environment, promoting discussion among those in different areas
of research and career stage. For example, bioengineers and clinicians will benefit from learning about how
tissues develop so that those principles can be applied to engineering and regenerative treatment strategies.
The preceding GRS, run by and for trainees, provides a forum for trainees to present and discuss their work
among their peers, building confidence for discussion and networking. In addition, the GRS includes a
mentoring panel, where trainees are provided with information on career paths, grant writing, and other career
topics. We expect the 2025 GRC/GRS on Cartilage Biology and Pathology to empower researchers across
disciplines to make significant progress toward understanding cartilage biology and improving human health."

PROJECT SUMMARY
 Despite the critical influence of both aging and the immune system on carcinogenesis there is little
understanding of the interplay between aging and anti-cancer immune responses. We hypothesize that immune
responses to lung tumor decreases with age such that the immune system has less impact on tumor initiation
and growth within the aged environment. To enable rapid analysis of gene function in cancer models in vivo
across different environment including aging, we have integrated genetically engineered mouse models,
multiplexed CRISPR-based somatic genome engineering, and tumor barcoding (including an optimized platform
called Tuba-seqUltra). These approaches enable the quantification of the impact of many genes of interest on lung
tumorigenesis in parallel with unprecedented resolution and ease. To quantify the impact of aging on the
importance of diverse immune pathways on lung carcinogenesis, we will generate a focused Tuba-seqUltra
lentiviral pool targeting many regulators of cancer immunity and generate autochthonous lung tumors of each
genotype in parallel. These quantitative in vivo genetic approaches will uncover the interactions between age
and anti-cancer adaptive and innate immune responses that control lung tumor initiation and growth. The
quantitative data from Tuba-seqUltra requires equally robust analytical and statistical methods to maximize our
ability to uncover the impact of aging on immune related pathways in lung cancer cells. We will refine our existing
pipelines to quantify the impact of each immune-related perturbation in lung carcinogenesis and comparing their
effects with age. This proposal will leverage the complementary strengths of our laboratories to assess the impact
of immune responses in cancer across age. Our expertise in high-throughput in vivo cancer modeling (Winslow
laboratory) and cancer immunology (Reticker-Flynn laboratory) will uniquely allow us to explore the interface
between aging and immune responses to lung cancer. These highly quantitative in vivo experiments will
transform our understanding of how aging changes the impact of adaptive and innate immune responses on
lung tumor initiation and growth. These functional studies will provide key insights into the cancer-immune
interactions that change with age and could have important implication for lung cancer prevention and treatment"

Arrhythmogenic cardiovascular disease, which disproportionately affects individuals in the VA population with
acquired cardiac and metabolic diseases, particularly heart failure, is associated with increased morbidity and
mortality. The mechanisms contributing to increased risk of sudden cardiac death in individuals suffering
arrhythmogenic cardiovascular disease, however, remain very poorly understood, hampering our ability to risk
stratify patients and to develop novel, targeted therapeutic strategies. Although numerous experimental
(animal/cellular) heart failure models have been developed and extensively studied, only limited insights into
human arrhythmia mechanisms have been provided. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap and advance the
field, we have initiated a comprehensive research effort aimed at defining the mechanisms involved in the
physiological regulation of membrane excitability in the human heart and the pathophysiological electrical
remodeling associated with human heart failure. To enable direct molecular/biochemical and functional studies
on human ventricular myocardium/myocytes, we developed the infrastructure to acquire non-failing and failing
human hearts and we established robust, reliable methods for the isolation, in vitro maintenance, adenovirus-
mediated transduction, and electrophysiological characterization of human ventricular myocytes. Here, we utilize
these unique resources in experiments designed to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling
the expression, the properties and the remodeling of critical ionic currents that impact action potential
repolarization, the late component of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) current, INa,L, and the novel non-inactivating K+
(Kv) current, IK,L, that we have recently identified in non-failing human left ventricles. We will define the roles of
channel accessory subunits and post-translational modifications in controlling the cell surface expression and
the biophysical and pharmacological properties of native human ventricular INa,L (aim #1) and IK,L (aim #2). In
aim #2, we shall also explore the hypothesis that there are actually two, functionally and molecularly distinct
components of human ventricular IK,L. Additional experiments (aim #3) will elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying in INa,L and IK,L remodeling in failing human ventricles.
These studies will provide new, clinically relevant insights into the cellular/molecular mechanisms contributing to
the physiological regulation and pathophysiological remodeling of native human ventricular Ito,f, Iss and INa
channels. These insights will transform the refinement of human cardiac myocyte and whole heart models and
translate to novel, mechanism-based strategies to target specific cell types to reduce the risk of life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias in VA patients suffering heart failure."

Successful language comprehension requires mapping a complex and variable acoustic signal onto meaningful
units. Many studies show that perception of the speech signal recruits both left and right hemisphere temporal
brain regions, yet only individuals with left hemisphere damage typically have deficits in processing sound
structure that impact comprehension. A persistent mystery is the role of the right hemisphere in speech
perception. In the current proposal, we test two key hypotheses about the role of the right hemisphere in speech
sound processing. In Aim 1, a series of studies test the hypothesis that right and left temporal lobes differ in the
precision with which they respond to speech, with left hemisphere showing sharp, categorical responses and the
right having less precise and more gradient responses to speech. In Aim 2, motivated by work from the last grant
cycle, we test the role of the right hemisphere in a process that is key to efficient language processing: learning
the specific phonetic qualities of talkers. We approach these questions using converging methods, using neural
decoding techniques on functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data to measure differences in neural tuning to phonetic
stimuli, implementing a “virtual lesion” approach using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the
consequences of left and right hemisphere disruption, and testing individuals with right and left temporal lesions
to understand the functional consequences of damage to the systems supporting speech perception in both
hemispheres. In concert, this work will delineate the neural systems that support efficient and flexible processing
of the speech signal. This grant’s innovation stems from its multi-method approach and the focus on right
hemisphere function, a neglected component of the language architecture. Finally, this line of work will inform
successful remediation of stroke, revealing the roles and functions of spared left and right hemisphere systems
that can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes."
11067502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapeutic restoration of protein function is a key goal for many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)
caused by genetic haploinsufficiency. MYT1L syndrome is a recently identified, understudied NDD caused by
heterozygous loss of function mutations in the MYT1L gene, characterized by global developmental delay,
particularly in motor and language development, intellectual disability, highly penetrant obesity and hypotonia,
and a significant comorbidity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). Mice and human neurons with a MYT1L stop-gain mutation only show ~30% decreased transcript
and protein levels, yet display profound cellular, molecular, and behavioral anomalies, indicating that MYT1L
levels need to be tightly controlled for normal function. However, it is unknown how MYT1L levels are
regulated. Understanding this regulation is a key step to identifying clinically relevant strategies for
upregulating MYT1L as a therapy for MYT1L syndrome. An emerging protein upregulation strategy is to use
antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to block elements that normally destabilize mRNA. Thus, ASOs could be
used to increase protein expression from the mRNA of the remaining healthy allele. MYT1L has a conserved
and longer than average 3’ untranslated region (UTR), which contains many regulatory elements responsible
for transcript stability and translation efficiency, properties critical for protein synthesis. Using bioinformatic
analyses, existing microRNA (miRNA) binding data, and a preliminary screen for active regulatory elements
using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), we have identified regions that may reduce stability of
MYT1L transcripts, which I have therefore termed MYT1L Negative Regulatory Elements (MNREs), and
discovered several candidate ASOs that increase expression. MNREs contain several predicted miRNA
response elements (MRE) and Pumilio (PUM) response elements (PRE), which both induce translational
repression or transcript degradation. This project seeks to study MYT1L post- transcriptional regulation (PTR)
and its potential to be harnessed in translational therapies like ASOs for MYT1L syndrome. Aim 1 will test the
importance of specific MRE and PRE sequences in MYT1L mRNA stability and screen for additional MNREs
using an MPRA in iPSC-derived neurons to capture PTR in an appropriate cellular context. ASOs will both be
used as tools and potentially be deliverables. Aim 2 will test the efficacy of a candidate ASO targeting a
conserved MRE in restoring MYT1L protein levels in MYT1L haploinsufficient mice and rescuing associated
transcriptomic and behavioral phenotypes. These findings will begin to explore MYT1L PTR and provide
clinically relevant insights for rescue of MYT1L haploinsufficiency by direct targeting of MYT1L. This project will
also provide the applicant the opportunity to train in RNA therapeutics, computational genomics, animal
behavior to prepare for a future career as a physician-scientist studying neurogenetic disorders."
11073359,"ABSTRACT
The auditory system is posed with answering a challenging question: Does sound arriving at each ear originate
from a single source or multiple sources? To accomplish this perceptual feat, central auditory neural circuits
must accurately assess the spectral and temporal profile of bilateral sound signals to bind and integrate related
acoustic objects. Failure of this bilateral integrative process can account for many of the perceptual and
behavioral impairments that accompany auditory disorders, such as tinnitus, presbycusis and central auditory
processing disorders, which most of the population will experience over the lifespan. Surprisingly, the neural
mechanisms that enable this bilateral integration of acoustic information remain largely unknown, but likely
depend on an intricate balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections that link the two halves of the auditory
brain. Although commissural pathways have been well studied in auditory brainstem centers, much less is known
about the functional organization of commissural circuitry in higher centers of the auditory brain. Thus, the long-
term goals of our research are to understand the functional organization of the commissural pathways in the
processing of bilateral auditory information. Our primary objective here is to test a largely overlooked, yet
substantial, commissural auditory projection system, i.e. the pathway from the inferior colliculus to the
contralateral medial geniculate body. Our central hypothesis is that the medial geniculate body integrates
functionally and topographically aligned inputs from both the ipsilateral and contralateral inferior colliculi at a cell-
type specific level. Further, we hypothesize that the disruption of such bilateral tectothalamic convergence
results in deficits to the spectral and temporal processing of acoustic information in the medial geniculate body,
which contributes to disorders of the central auditory system. We will test our hypotheses by assessing: 1) the
functional neuroanatomy and 2) the neurophysiological impact of these contralateral tectothalamic pathways on
auditory processing, by employing modern, cell-type specific neuroanatomical and neurophysiological
approaches. As such, these studies are innovative since they address the unknown and unexplored functional
organization of the contralateral auditory tectothalamic pathways. Finally, the proposed experiments are
significant since they are expected to reveal mechanistic features of auditory processing that will have a positive
impact for neural diagnostics and treatments for central auditory impairments."

Diet-induced obesity affects about 40 percent of US women and increases the incidence, morbidity, and mortality
of postmenopausal breast cancer (BC). Obesity also increases the risk of large, high-grade tumors, metastasis,
and recurrence regardless of menopausal status. Our goal is to contribute to the development of new therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of obesity-associated human BC. Our research proposal addresses this by testing
whether dietary lipids induce the biosynthesis of ceramides which accelerate BC tumor growth. Supported by
published evidence and our own preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that, in settings of chronic dietary
lipid overabundance such as obesity, BC cells are wired to utilize free fatty acids (FFA) over glucose to support
cancer lipid anabolism, resulting in accelerated tumor growth. Moreover, our data suggests that ceramides
dictate this fuel choice by serving as feed-forward signals of fatty acid excess that increase fat utilization and
decrease carbohydrate oxidation. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims: 1) to test the
hypothesis that ceramide-lowering interventions negate the impact of ketogenic diets or apolipoprotein E
knockout on breast cancer growth; 2) to determine whether experimental induction of ceramides alters fuel
choice and accelerates breast cancer growth. Our approach, which collectively addresses physiology, adipose
biology, and tumor metabolism, is enabled by our combined expertise in ceramides (Dr. Summers), nutrition and
metabolic status (Dr. Chaix), adipose tissue biology (Dr. Hilgendorf), and in vivo stable isotope tracing to study
tumor metabolism (Dr. Ducker). Together, we have established a system in which BC tumor growth can be
accelerated solely by the manipulation of circulating levels of lipids, independent of adiposity and associated
metabolic syndrome. This lipid-centric view of tumor metabolism generates strong testable hypotheses for future
therapeutic interventions, including the one described herein that ceramides are obligate intermediates that link
excessive saturated fats to worsened breast cancer outcomes."
11059038,"Background: Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecologic cancer. While curative treatments exist for early-
stage cancers, there is a lack of specific biomarkers for detecting preneoplastic lesions, which usually occur in
the fallopian tube epithelia (FTE). Normal FTE consists of small clusters of secretory and ciliated cells intermixed
in an approximately 1:1 ratio. Although the mechanism of FTE transformation is not fully understood, it is believed
that hormones and growth factors in the follicular fluid expose FTE to genotoxic stress during ovulation and that
escape from the stress-induced cell death leads to an aberrant accumulation of secretory cells. In this
microenvironment, secretory cells sometimes undergo genetic and morphologic changes that include
stratification, atypia, and loss of cell polarity, which are considered the precursor lesions to ovarian cancer.
Aberrant secretory cell accumulation is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer and is more common
in women with germline BRCA1 mutations. However, the morphologic changes and molecular mechanisms that
lead to secretory cell transformation are unknown. Specifically, the role of ciliated cells in the formation of
precursor FTE lesions is unknown.
Preliminary data: Our histologic and molecular analyses of FTE from BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers
revealed that postmenopausal BRCA1 mutation carriers have a higher ratio of secretory to ciliated cells and
increased levels of the cell survival-associated genes CDK1 and Survivin, suggesting that secretory cells escape
cell death. Unexpectedly, we observed that homotypic cell segregation and loss of ciliated cells precede
secretory cell accumulation.
Hypothesis: We propose that homotypic cell signaling and loss of ciliated cells create a favorable
microenvironment for secretory cell transformation in BRCA1 mutant FTE providing that other conditions, such
as hormonal changes and genotoxic stress, coincide and tip the balance toward uncontrolled proliferation.
Unique resources: We are the first group to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into FTE and
establish iPSC organoids from BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers. We have one of the largest collections
of FTE specimens with detailed clinicopathologic and demographic data from high-risk patients. We will leverage
our recently developed computational imaging convolutional neural networks pipeline for extraction of “hidden”
preneoplastic characteristics for biomarker development and identification of potential targets for prevention.
Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will use human and mouse FTE organoids and in vivo mouse models to test the
hypothesis that ciliated cells protect secretory cells from genotoxic stress. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that aberrant secretory cell survival under genotoxic stress can be counteracted by pharmacologic inhibitors of
genes involved in cell survival, such as CDK1 and Survivin. In Aim 3, we will integrate RNA sequencing and
image processing with deep-neural network learning to identify clinically-relevant molecular and
histomorphometric biomarkers of preneoplastic lesions in fallopian tubes from BRCA1 mutation carriers.
Impact: This research will lead to a better understanding of the interplay between predisposing genetic mutations

morphometric contributors to the formation of the precancer niche will assist in the development of new strategies
for ovarian cancer prevention and detection, which are urgently needed in clinical practice."
11059706,"ABSTRACT: Glial immune signaling in radiation-induced brain injury.
Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of CNS cancers often leads to unintended and
debilitating cognitive impairments. CRT also remains the standard of care to counter brain
metastases for other invasive cancers. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying CRT-induced cognitive decline are multifaceted and have not been completely
resolved. Our past findings show that whole-brain, acute CRT induces progressive
neurodegenerative changes, including oxidative stress, reduced neurogenesis, and increased
neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes form complex glial networks in the CNS by pruning
and maintaining thousands of synapses that are actively involved in cognition. Yet, we have
shown that CRT-induced cognitive disruption coincides with astrocytic hypertrophy, elevated
expression of astrogliosis genes, and persistent microglial activation in rodent models. Therefore,
we hypothesize that detrimental glial signaling significantly contributes to cognitive deficits. The
complement system is a potent mediator of the glial activation, but it also has a range of non-
immune functions in the CNS, including synaptic pruning and clearance of apoptotic cells and
cellular debris which is detrimental if dysregulated. Particularly, global elevation in the expression
of complement C1q and C3 in the CNS has been reported in neurodegenerative conditions. Our
findings indicate that acute, whole-brain CRT-mediated chronic microglial activation and reactive
astrocytes, elevated co-expression of complement proteins (C1q, C3) and specific receptors
(C5aR1, TLR4) coincided with cognitive impairments. Reactive gliosis has been shown to
upregulate complement cascade proteins that are destructive to synapses and associated with
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that brain cancer therapy-induced aberrant activation in the
glial complement cascade leads to cognitive deficits. Our hypothesis is supported by two key
preliminary data sets targeting complement signaling at the upstream (C1q) and the downstream
(C5a) activation branch points. First, exposure of conditional microglia-selective C1q (knockdown)
mice to CRT did not exhibit impaired cognition and showed a lack of neuroinflammation as
compared to irradiated WT mice. Second, treatment with an orally active, BBB permeable, C5a
receptor (C5aR1) antagonist ameliorated acute CRT-induced cognitive deficits and alleviated
microglial activation in the irradiated brain. Our hypothesis will be addressed using a clinically
relevant, fractionated, focal cranial irradiation paradigm ± temozolomide, transgenic and glioma-
bearing syngeneic mouse models, and pharmacologic approaches designed to test mechanisms
and therapeutic interventions to restore cognitive function in the impaired animals."

Mammalian cells tightly control the membrane lipid composition of their organelles, and the key
homeostatic machinery for many lipids resides within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proteins in the ER
must respond to changes in lipid levels, but how proteins respond to changes in lipid composition remains
largely unknown. Protein degradation is a key part of feedback loops that regulate cholesterol and
sphingolipid biosynthetic pathways, yet how protein homeostasis is influence by the membrane itself is
unknown. Resolving this basic knowledge gap will provide insights into membrane protein biology and
potentially uncover new directions for treating metabolic diseases. To better understand how the ER
membrane influences protein function and how this feeds back into lipid metabolism, we focus on the
activity ER resident ubiquitin E3 ligases and their substrates. E3 ligases label substrate proteins with
ubiquitin, which causes the substrate proteins to be degraded by the proteasome system. We will study
how these enzymes and their substrate proteins are regulated in the ER membrane and how their activity,
in turn, regulates lipid levels.
In the first aim, we will study how membrane cholesterol levels influence the activity and substrate
recognition of two ER-localized E3 ligases called MARCH6 and TRC8. We will use cellular and biochemical
assays to determine the lipid binding specificity and activity relationships for these two enzymes. We will
use cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate how these enzymes recognize sterols and how membrane lipids
influence the ability of these enzymes to form active complexes with substrate proteins. Through these
efforts we will discover biophysical principles that may apply to a broad range of membrane bound
mammalian E3 ligases. In the second aim, we will begin to uncover how targeted protein degradation
regulates sphingolipid metabolism. We will use molecular dissection techniques along with candidate and
discovery-based approaches to elucidate the molecular determinants of the regulated degradation of
regulatory proteins called ORMDLs that control sphingolipid biosynthesis. Together, these aims will provide
the first insights into substrate recognition of mammalian membrane E3 ligases and a new understanding
of how these membrane sensors function in cells."

Effective control of acute and chronic pain is a major medical challenge related to patients quality of 
life. Treatment with systemic medications is frequently associated with problems, such as addiction, 
illegal abuse and even death, leading to social problems and economic burden. Local anesthetics are 
effective alternatives in treating localized pain without clouding the sensorium, and systemic side effects 
are generally uncommon. During the mentored K99 phase, the PI will design, synthesize and characterize 
novel light-responsive polymer-local anesthetic conjugates for on-demand local pain treatment. In this 
design, the local anesthetics will be chemically bound to polymeric carriers in a manner that could only be 
reversed by photo-triggering. Materials developed in this project will enable a local anesthetic release 
system, in which after first administration, pain relief will be controllable in real-time by the patient or 
clinician using a light source (light-emitting diode or laser). When combined with the PI s background in 
chemistry and polymer science, the training and results in the mentored phase will empower the PI, in the 
R00 phase, to further extend the application of light triggerable materials to the design, synthesis and 
characterization of novel light-responsive tissue adhesives. Most existing tissue adhesives are 
inconvenient to reposition during the application, remove undesired residue, or correct inadvertent 
placement of glue in the wrong position. The R00 project will develop tissue adhesive based on 
crosslinkable multiarmed polymers with photocleavable properties. The material will be dissolvable upon 
light irradiation, allowing convenient and non-invasive removal of the adhesives. During the award period, 
the PI will receive training in drug delivery systems, light-responsive materials, in vivo characterizations of 
materials, and training in career development, which will greatly increase the PI s breadth of skills 
experience in biomaterials and prepare him for an independent academic career."

This research aims to provide novel statistical and deep learning (DL) tools to address open
methodological challenges in understanding and mitigating health disparities in the United States in the
context of the climate crisis. It focuses especially on the health effects of extreme heat and air pollution.
Marginalized populations often bear the brunt of climate threats. It is thus vital to identify the communities
and individuals that are most vulnerable. To enable such analysis, this multi-disciplinary research brings
together computer scientists and biostatisticians to promote principled and synergistic advancements in
Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and spatial Causal Inference (Cl) to address open technical challenges
in the fields of TDL, Cl, and Spatial Statistics. The project is centered around three thrusts. Thrust 1:
Develop new TDL methods to process multi-resolution irregular areal data; Thrust 2: Leverage TDL in
spatiotemporal causal inference; Thrust 3: Establish a methodological framework to jointly leverage
TDL-based spatial and individual-level representations. Innovations include new TDL methods to address
key gaps in DL for areal spatial data, the first theoretically grounded framework leveraging TDL for
learning from aggregated outcomes under spatial heterogeneity in areal data, and new TDL methods for
causal inference using spatiotemporal data. This project will result in the first multi-modal scalable
framework for learning joint representations of geospatial data and individual-level health records.
Large-scale case studies utilizing Medicare data from 2000 to 2020 and a vast amount of spatial and
longitudinal data will allow the translation of research results into actionable information to inform policies
and interventions to reduce health disparities. The successful completion of this research will address
scientific policy-relevant questions such as: Which social and structural determinants of health lead to
higher vulnerability to hospitalization and death caused by extreme heat, and, therefore, more urgently
need mitigation policies to ensure climate justice? How does exposure to air pollution exacerbate
geographic health disparities due to exposure to heat over the short- and long-term? Does individual-level
medical history contribute to recurrent hospitalizations among individuals of low socioeconomic status?"

Mechanical forces generated by a rigid extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment play a key
role in tumor progression and metastasis. We recently discovered a critical role of EPHA2 non-canonical
signaling in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion and metastasis in response
to increasing ECM stiffness in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that activation of EPHA2
canonical signaling by the ephrinA1 ligand potently inhibits stiffness-induced breast cancer cell invasiveness.
Based on these results, we hypothesize that EPHA2 functions as a key rheostat that integrates both
mechanical and biochemical cues from the tumor microenvironment to regulate mechanosignaling in breast
cancer progression and metastasis. We propose to combine biochemical, 2D and 3D cell culture assays, and
in vivo xenograft models to elucidate EPHA2 signaling mechanisms in breast cancer malignancy induced by
ECM rigidity through three specific aims. (1) Determine how ECM rigidity activates EPHA2 non-canonical
signaling to promote EMT and invasion. (2) Determine how EPHA2 canonical signaling blocks EMT and
invasion induced by ECM rigidity. (3) Examine the role of EPHA2 non-canonical and canonical signaling in
breast cancer invasion and metastasis in vivo. Together, these studies will inform on the potential usefulness
of activating EphA2 canonical signaling for inhibition of breast cancer invasiveness and metastasis."

 Progressive disorders of airway protection, such as swallowing disorders (dysphagia) and cough
disorders (dystussia), are highly prevalent in PD and have significant negative implications for health and quality
of life. In fact, aspiration pneumonia, commonly associated with dysphagia/dystussia, is a leading cause of death
in PD. Despite this, approximately 40% of individuals with PD in the United States do not access rehabilitation
services or receive specialized care for these potentially life-threatening airway protective deficits. This is
compounded by a multitude of health inequities leading to ethnic/racial minorities and those from disadvantaged
regions being less likely to receive care. Despite the clear healthcare disparities, there are very few studies
examining patient perspectives as it relates to airway protection and no studies that have specifically examined
the perspectives and experiences of historically marginalized groups – including Black and Hispanic individuals
and those from disadvantaged regions – following airway protective interventions. Our long-term goal is to
improve the health outcomes of individuals with PD by increasing airway protective treatment uptake. The overall
objective of this application, an administrative supplement to our parent award R01 NS126319-01, is to utilize
an embedded mixed methods design, in which we will use qualitative data to (1) understand how participants
experience EMST and CST treatment both in-person and via telehealth, (2) examine the impact of treatment
barriers and facilitators on treatment adherence and primary treatment outcomes, and (3) qualitatively explore
treatment acceptability and satisfaction among Black and Hispanic individuals and those from disadvantaged
regions. This supplement will focus on obtaining qualitative data through semi-structured in-depth interviews
following treatment to explore treatment acceptability and satisfaction, including their barriers and facilitators.
Participants will be purposively selected to ensure representation across traditionally underrepresented racial
and ethnic groups, specifically Black and Hispanic individuals and those from disadvantaged regions. The
proposed study will be the first to utilize a mixed methodology to elucidate patient perspectives and identify
barriers and facilitators to engaging in airway protective rehabilitation in-person and via telehealth. This study
will yield critical evidence for refining EMST and CST - increasing personalized, accessible, and equitable airway
protective care for pwPD. These findings will also set the stage to culturally align airway protective treatments
such that future work can more effectively engage individuals from under-represented and disadvantaged
groups."

BACKGROUND: Several independent lines of evidence suggest that sleep disturbance may directly contribute
to the generation and maintenance of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) including anxiety, depression, agitation,
irritability, and apathy through fronto-limbic brain networks that regulate emotion, particularly in regions of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic areas (amygdala). However, the model of sleep disturbance contributing to
increased NPS through impairments in fronto-limbic function has not yet been tested in a sample of participants
with or at high-risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We aim to test this model in patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD by characterizing associations between sleep disruption,
fronto-limbic function while regulating emotion, and NPS at baseline and by experimentally manipulating sleep to
determine whether changes in sleep cause downstream alterations in fronto-limbic functioning and NPS.
DESIGN/METHODS: Our hypotheses will be tested in a 2-arm randomized controlled mechanistic trial with 150
patients with MCI and mild AD experiencing sleep disturbances who are also experiencing emotional distress
and other behavioral symptoms. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a sleep manipulation
(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia; CBT-I) or to the credible control treatment for insomnia group.
Both interventions will be administered in six sessions delivered over eight weeks. CBT-I is an efficacious
behavioral intervention specifically targeted at improving sleep patterns through a combination of sleep
restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep hygiene
education. At baseline, and post-sleep manipulation we will assay each participant’s fronto-limbic functioning
while regulating emotions (amygdala reactivity and PFC-amygdala connectivity), NPS using the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI), and sleep efficiency using high-density EEG collected overnight during sleep. SPECIFIC AIMS
are to 1) characterize baseline associations among sleep disturbances, emotion regulation brain function, and
NPS prior to a sleep manipulation, 2) test that sleep-induced fronto-limbic brain function improvement mediates
the association between sleep improvement and NPS reductions, and 3) determine baseline predictors of the
NPS improvement. NOVELTY & IMPACT: Using a multi-methodological approach within a mechanistic trial
framework by causally manipulating sleep, we will uncover potential NPS mechanisms across multiple units of
analysis (brain circuit, physiological, behavioral, and self-report). Our results will advance a mechanistic
understanding of how sleep disturbances and fronto-limbic brain function while regulating emotions may
underlie the emotionally distressing and economically relevant problem of NPS in early AD patients. These
results would be a necessary first step in the development of sleep based, mechanism-focused preventative
strategies and treatments that are more personalized for the individual."

The behavior of B cell memory in mice and humans is an active area of research with implications for
traditional vaccine design and for the development of our engineered B cell vaccine (parent award). There
is data in mice supporting the idea that memory B cells have a very limited ability to re-enter germinal
centers. Alternatively, it has been shown that di?erent memory phenotypes exist with some showing a
preference for germinal center re-entry. We hypothesize that memory behavior, similar to naive cell
behavior, may also depend on immunogen a?inity, valency, and availability of T cell help. We will explore
these ideas by generating various memory phenotypes using in vitro B cell activation and adoptive transfer
to increase the frequency of antigen-speciﬁc memory in the B6 mouse model (which is normally very low).
We will then vaccinate using antigens with deﬁned a?inities and valency’s to see if these factors impact
memory cell developmental fates. We would also like to immunize memory at di?erent times to see if
changing memory B cell surface markers are associated with altered cell behaviors in response to
vaccination."

Alcohol is a well-known myotoxin that with sustained use can culminate in alcohol-associated muscle disease
(AAMD), characterized by muscle weakness and functional decline, along with metabolic impairments and
decreases in muscle size (i.e., mass), that culminate in reduced quality of life. While mechanisms regulating
protein balance have previously been implicated in AAMD development, additional pathways require
exploration to develop new therapeutic targets as none currently exist. Our previous work indicates that both
binge and chronic alcohol intoxication disrupt the core molecular clock within the skeletal muscle however,
whether clock disruption contributes to the etiology of AAMD remains unknown. Overall, the long-term goal is
to mechanistically determine whether alcohol’s influence on the skeletal muscle core clock impacts alcohol-
associated disease risk, as well as to determine how alcohol modulates the core clock so that targeting of
specific clock components can be used as therapeutic interventions. Specifically, skeletal muscle contractile
strength is reduced by chronic alcohol use in a manner that closely parallels that caused by skeletal muscle-
specific core molecular clock disruption (in the absence of alcohol), inferring that alcohol-induced disruption in
the core clock may be responsible for AAMD associated weakness. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 of the current
proposal is to determine whether disruption to the skeletal muscle core molecular clock contributes to the
decreases in contractile function caused by chronic alcohol use. The second Aim will be to determine how
alcohol consumption causes skeletal muscle core clock disruption so that preventative interventions can be
developed. Specific Aim 1 will use a mouse model of muscle-specific circadian pathway dysfunction caused by
the inducible deletion of the core clock gene Brain muscle arnt like-1 (Bmal1) to determine the role of the
skeletal muscle clock on contractile function during alcohol intoxication. Specific Aim 2 will define the role of
alcohol and alcohol-related factors in the disruption of the skeletal muscle clock by investigating the influence
of both peripheral circulating factors produced during alcohol metabolism and the role of the central (i.e. brain-
specific) administration of alcohol on the circadian function within the skeletal muscle. These research
questions will be addressed by using a variety of physiological models paired with in vitro, in vivo and in situ
techniques. This investigation will be the first of its kind in the study of the effects of alcohol on core clock
function in the muscle and one of the few to consider the influence of peripheral tissues in the development of
AAMD. Lastly, it will lay the foundation for continued mechanistic investigations to determine the role of the
core molecular clock in AAMD."

Terpenoids are the largest class of naturally occurring small molecules. While the majority of terpenoids originate
from plants and fungi, bacteria are also capable of producing them. Terpenoids are generated from sequential
additions of isoprene units, followed by derivatization via terpene synthase and cyclase enzymes. We have
analyzed Human Microbiome Project metagenomes using secondary metabolite prediction algorithms and found
that half of all human gut microbiomes carry at least one terpene biosynthetic pathway. We also recently
leveraged a high-throughput functional metagenomics approach and discovered that a histidine phosphatase
present in the human fecal microbiome without homology to known terpene synthases catalyzed the formation
of terpenoids. Carotenoids are mainly tetraterpenoids and are vitamin A precursors with important antioxidant,
immunological, and metabolic functions. The overall absorption efficiency of carotenoids can be quite low in the
small intestine; therefore, a significant quantity of carotenoids is transferred to the colon. When carotenoids enter
the colon, they can interact with the colonic epithelium by acting on biochemical pathways, as we have previously
shown. Despite this knowledge, how the gut microbiota might transform these compounds and how microbially
produced terpenes/carotenoids impact the gut lining are understudied. We have found that 93.3% of subjects
from the Human Microbiome Project contain carotenoid-modifying enzymes in their gut microbiota, and over half
of these subjects contain a terpene biosynthesis pathway. Other researchers have shown that a reduced
abundance of phytoene dehydrogenase in the gut microbiota is associated with symptomatic atherosclerosis,
and that gut bacteria synthesize retinoic acid to modulate host immunity. Carotenoids and their microbial
derivatives, therefore, have significant health impacts. In support of this, we have found that carotenoids in
carrots mitigated obesity-associated gut dysbiosis. Considering all this data, we hypothesize that the human gut
microbiome possesses yet-undiscovered terpene synthases and carotenoid modifying enzymes, and microbial
terpenoids/carotenoids can display immunomodulatory activities in the colon. To test these hypotheses, we first
will use a novel phage-based functional metagenomics approach and high-throughput screens to reveal terpene
synthases and carotenoid modifying enzymes. We then will conduct analytical chemistry experiments to
characterize the products of these enzymes. Finally, we will illustrate their biological activities in colon cells at
the immunological and proteomic levels. Taken together, this work will reveal new chemistry performed by the
gut microbiota and its effects on human health."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029.
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are premalignant lesions that can develop into invasive
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Most pancreatic premalignancies are microscopic and not
identifiable by current imaging exams. The only PDAC precursor that can be diagnosed by imaging test are the
IPMNs. Since not all IPMN develop into PDAC, it is critical to understand the evolution of this premalignant
lesions to develop diagnostic tools to discriminate the ones that require therapeutic intervention to prevent
cancer. The Parent U01 award proposes a systems biology approach, combining DNA-sequencing, RNA-
sequencing and refined computational tools, to characterize the clonal evolution of IPMN by examining clinical
specimens and patient derived organoid models. Although DNA- and RNA-sequencing have demonstrated
power to study the evolutionary trajectory and functional impact of molecular perturbations, respectively, the bulk
profiling does not allow proper interpretation of the TME composition and the cellular interactions happening
within the premalignant microenvironment. Therefore, we propose a new collaboration with Dr. Luciane
Kagohara to include on our systems biology approach the spatial transcriptomics analysis of human IPMN
samples to examine within the tissue context the transcriptional state of the premalignant microenvironment (Aim
1) and understand the intercellular interactions that are associated with the clonal evolution of these PDAC
precursors (Aim 2). This project enables further experimental and computational techniques to broaden the
comprehensive investigation of PDAC progression that could identify potential signatures for early detection and
therapy."

The aim of the parent R01, “Leveraging HIV care systems to improve cardiovascular disease prevention in the
Kingdom of eSwatini,” is to identify the set of health services that would provide the most health to the
population of Eswatini, taking into account budget constraints, healthcare workforce constraints, and pre-
existing infrastructure (e.g., HIV clinics). The research informs Eswatini’s planned implementation of universal
health coverage, which will offer residents a health benefits package (HBP) of services that can be delivered
within resource constraints. This Supplement proposes to strengthen Eswatini’s HBP design by incorporating
the bioethics concepts of justice (the fairness of distribution according to what is deserved) and the related
concept of equity (the absence of disparities according to levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage).
Specifically, we will extend the parent award’s approach of determining which HBP would provide the most
health to the population by also taking into account how equally or unequally health benefits are allocated
according to contextually relevant determinants of heath. We will (Aim 1) systematically elicit strengths of
inequity aversion along key dimensions (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, level of education, HIV status,
and other factors nominated by stakeholders) using the Delphi-based systematic group decision-making
techniques used in the parent award, and (Aim 2) augment the HBP optimization process by incorporating
inequity aversion using Atkinson’s method, which adjusts health outcomes according to how equitably or
inequitably they are distributed. We will then calculate the threshold level of inequity aversion needed to “flip”
the status of a health service between inclusion and non-inclusion in the HBP. To contextualize the results, we
will benchmark levels of inequity aversion in Aim 2 base on the information gained in Aim 1, but to ensure Aim
independence, we will also use benchmarks informed by literature, including two studies in Eastern Africa. This
research will pioneer estimation of inequity aversion in a new region and with unprecedented nuance in
contextualizing health determinants and their intersections. It will also will pioneer the calculation of threshold
inequity aversion levels that would be needed to change inference for policy decision-making, making the
results applicable as further research on inequity aversion accrues. Insights from this project can help shape
future bioethics research priorities and approaches to policy decision-making."

Language disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that occurs in ~7% of children starting school
(Tomblin et al., 1997; Norbury et al., 2016). It has high comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) (Ellis Weismer, 2013) and other impairments (Mueller and Tomblin, 2012; Snowling et al.,
2020), which makes it challenging to identify its unique genomic and synaptic mechanisms. The focus
of this proposal is to apply computational genomics and behavioral neuroscience to study language
disorder in the context of learned sound association, the process by which the auditory nervous
system associates a sound with a certain outcome (Stanley, 2023; Stanley et al., 2024). In Aim 1, I will
use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analysis methods to conduct a
large-scale analysis of the variants, genes, and pathways involved in language disorder and identify
shared and distinct genetic factors between language disorder and ASD using human genetic data
from the Genetics of Language (GenLang) consortium, the Simons Foundation Powering Autism
Research (SPARK) dataset, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort,
and the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank. In Aim 2, I will conduct behavioral sound association
experiments with wildtype (WT) and mutant mouse models using an interactive virtual reality (VR)
environment, where mice will be trained to associate auditory cues with rewarding/aversive stimuli.
Neuronal activity will be measured using fiber photometry recordings in the tail of the striatum. The
comparison of human genetic data from Aim 1 with mouse physiology and behavioral data in Aim 2
will identify the timing and role for language disorder/ASD-linked genes in sound association learning
and its disruption in neurodevelopmental disease."

People experiencing homelessness have a disproportionate burden of mental illness and mortality than those
who are not homeless. The environment in congregate shelter accommodation may significantly contribute to
this health burden, particularly regarding mental health. Housing insecurity significantly increases risk of
presenting to the emergency department in behavioral crises, especially for individuals who are Black and Latinx
as well as sexual and gender minorities. In response to public health concerns regarding the specific
vulnerabilities of this population to COVID, many cities implemented programs diverting congregate shelter
residents, most commonly to hotel accommodation. There is some evidence that the shift to non-congregate
living may have had a positive impact on people's mental health. Connecticut localities are planning new policies
designed to build on lessons learned from that period, providing non-congregate options through healthcare-
community partnership organizations to people who are unhoused. Understanding the mental health effects of
non-congregate shelter options is essential to inform these developing policy reforms and innovations.
This project will use a Community Based Participatory Research transformative approach, with a multistage
convergent parallel mixed methods design, to measure the impact of healthcare-housing community
partnerships that support non-congregate living interventions on mental health. We will conduct the study in
Connecticut, which received the most expansive eligibility standards in the nation and included diversion of the
state's entire homeless population to hotel rooms. This context presents an unprecedented opportunity to study
the relationship between shelter interventions and mental health outcomes. We will aim to study the impact of
both the above-mentioned shelter policies and developing and ongoing post-pandemic housing initiatives on
mental health crises by: 1) Qualitatively exploring mechanisms between non-congregate housing policies and
mental illness including a landscape analysis to characterize processes through which shelter and healthcare
providers partner to address housing needs, building on strong existing relationships with stakeholders and
people experiencing homelessness; 2) Characterizing the effect of Connecticut's hotel-based temporary shelter
program on mental health crises among patients experiencing homelessness who were diverted from congregate
shelters to hotel rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a control site in Alabama using data from
electronic medical records to perform a difference-in-differences identification strategy; and 3) Prospectively
evaluating, using mixed methods, the impact of post-pandemic housing policies that offer non-congregate living
options on mental health, including non-congregate spaces in existing shelters, and newer potential policies such
as tiny house villages. Findings from this study have the potential to inform policies and procedures of healthcare-
housing community partnerships and improve mental health among those experiencing homelessness."

The spike (S) protein decorates the surface of coronavirus (CoV) particles such as SARS-CoV-2 and enables
CoV's to enter and infect host cells. The S protein is the immunogen in genetic and subunit vaccines against
COVID-19, which were critical in controlling the COVID-19 global pandemic. In cells that are infected with CoV's
or have received a genetic vaccine, the S protein is synthesized in the mammalian cell endoplasmic reticulum
(ER), and then trafficking via the secretory pathway consisting of ER, Golgi network, and plasma membrane
(PM). This secretory trafficking of S is bidirectional between ER and Golgi, which are the secretory organelles
that provide the enzymatic machinery for post-translational modifications, remodeling, and maturation. This
includes enzymes for N-glycosylation, which modulates S folding, viral entry, and interactions with the host
immune system. Structure-function investigations have shown that N-glycans modulate conformations of S
domains, such as the immunogenic receptor binding domain (RBD). Therefore, S N-glycans play a direct role in
immune response modulation. As such, N-glycan maturation changes in S due to tissue-, population-, ethnicity-
, and age-specific differences in biosynthetic machinery have the potential to dramatically alter infection CoV
outcomes and genetic vaccine immunogenicity. Yet little is known about the atomic-level consequences of N-
glycan maturation on S structure-function. This is mainly due to the inability to arrest S in various stages of
trafficking and N-glycan maturation. In this grant application, we will use an innovative new methodology to
control S trafficking. Purified samples of these novel S constructs will be structurally characterized using latest
cryoEM and computational tools and assayed for interactions with highly potent conformation-sensitive
antibodies. This will generate unprecedented and the first insights into structural modulation of S conformations
and epitopes by N-glycan maturation. Collectively, these investigations will be highly significant in providing
fundamental insights into secretory trafficking and the role of bidirectional trafficking of S in modulating N-glycan
maturation and RBD conformations. These data will open avenues for the design of a new generation of S-based
vaccines with improved immunogenicity. In the future, the insights from this research will serve as a platform to
inform the design of vaccines against enveloped viruses that pose global health challenges such as HIV and
influenza, which utilize the host cell ER-Golgi-PM secretory pathway to acquire immunity evading glycans."
11059708,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapies hold immense promise to provide cures for many cancers and metastatic disease, but only
benefit a fraction of patients. Tumors can still engage multiple mechanisms to avoid and escape anti-tumor
immune responses, including suppression, inactivation, and exclusion of potential cytotoxic T cells, processes
which collaborate with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of these barriers has
led to a multitude of new immunomodulatory targets to be developed, some to be used in combination with
e.g., checkpoint blockade or CAR T cells. On the other hand, dominant barriers to immunotherapy can be
different among patients with the same cancer type, and thus there is a need for personalized approaches to
immunotherapy, so that the appropriate targets are used. Here we develop a novel organotypic culture devices
to maintain ex vivo cultures of primary tumors and an immune component (tumor-draining lymph nodes or
circulating leukocytes), on a platform that enables precise control over spatial, molecular, cellular, and
mechanical characteristics and that is relatively high-throughput to allow screening or large numbers of
experimental variables. In preliminary data, we show that these devices mirror key features of in vivo
responses to immunotherapy, such as improved tumor cell killing and increased markers of immunotoxicity
(possible adverse events) in response to cytokine immunotherapy. We propose that these devices can be used
both to screen for ideal immunotherapy combinations as well as to probe the basic mechanisms underlying the
deficiencies in the anti-tumor immune response for tumors exhibiting varying levels of immune infiltration,
neoantigen load, and baseline lymphatic densities. In this way, we can begin to build a stratification map that
aligns key morphological features of individual tumors to treatment regimes that are most likely to lead to
efficacy and tumor regression. Using a combination of both murine mouse models and primary patient-derived
biospecimens, we will take advantage of the level of control afforded by our novel organotypic devices to
mechanistically interrogate individual immune cell subsets and signaling axes, towards understanding their
roles in influencing the course and outcomes of anti-tumor immune responses."

Introduction: The diversification of genomics research cohorts is a national priority intended to accelerate
research and improve individualized prevention, treatment and care. Thus, robust, multi-phased stakeholder
engagement processes are needed to ethically engage various underrepresented populations to promote
equitable access to genomic discovery and translation. Given the unique historical, social, cultural, and ethical
context germane to conducting research with underserved communities in the rural South, there is an urgent
need to examine and characterize rural residents’ views related to genomics research.
Methods: This study employed a qualitative approach for a bi-directional education and discussion session
with the Community Institutional Review Board (IRB) in Macon County, Alabama (n=6) prior to facilitating
community engagement (CE) studios. CE studios were conducted with Macon County residents (n=22) to elicit
their views about regional and national genomics research studies, bio-specimen collection, biobanking,
informed consent, return of results, and ongoing study engagement. Preliminary themes from the CE studios
were determined through a conventional content analysis process. This preliminary data will be presented back
to the community for their feedback and results will be finalized. The final phase of the study will consist of
deliberative panels where CE studio findings will be presented back to the community through structured
discussions that will focus on best practices for engaging rural residents in all phases of genomics research,
privacy and fairness in the use of genetic information, informed consent, return of results, and dissemination of
study findings. Recruitment for deliberative panels is currently underway.
Results: Preliminary findings from CE studios with Macon County residents yielded five themes which include:
1) Family History/Medical History - the lack of family history, medical history, and knowledge/access to genetic
testing, 2) Trust, Transparency, and Visibility - reduced confidence and suspicions in research studies, medical
professionals, genetic testing, and individuals that do not racially identify with them, and the media, 3) Lack of
Resources - minimal access to hospitals, job opportunities, and optimal technology, 4) Communication and
Follow-up - researchers learning about their community and returning with study results that clearly inform and
educate the community, and 5) Medical Approaches - having access to 24/7 healthcare and precision
medicine. In the final phase, CE studio findings will be presented to deliberative panels to inform genomics
research priorities.
Conclusion: Engaging rural populations in the South in the full spectrum of genomics research to establish
ethical frameworks and guidelines that reflect their unique values, preferences and priorities is a national
priority. CE studios offer an important engagement strategy to promote ethical inclusion of medically
underserved populations in genomic discovery and translation."
11060404,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Improved treatment strategies for patients with cancer require enhanced tools to better predict patient response,
model clonal heterogeneity, and identify novel treatment options for individual patients. Patient-derived cancer
organoids (PDCOs) are a major advance providing more representative models of the human disease, including
the maintenance of molecular alterations, cell-cell communication, and the 3D architecture found in cancers. Our
groups have significant experience using PDCOs to predict treatment response for patients across cancer types.
These models, however, have unique challenges when used for translational studies, including (1) heterogeneity
between organoids from the same patient, (2) assessment techniques that require sample fixation or reagents
that prevent time-course studies of clonal evolution, and (3) lack of single organoid assessment and low-
throughput culture techniques that limit screens for new drugs.
We have developed optical metabolic imaging (OMI) using two-photon (2P) microscopy to measure treatment
response without a need for reagents (e.g., dyes, labels) or fixation. Our prior studies demonstrated that 2P OMI
can predict treatment response for patients with cancer. However, 2P microscopy is high cost, low throughput,
and complex to operate. To expand the use of OMI across multi-center translational studies of PDCOs, more
readily accessible imaging and analysis methods are needed for high/moderate throughput drug screening and
assessments of organoid metabolic heterogeneity over time. To enhance the accessibility of this technology to
more laboratories and facilitate the expanded use of PDCOs, we have developed a one-photon wide-field (WF)
OMI technique with single-organoid tracking and leading-edge segmentation methods for significantly reduced
cost, reduced complexity, and increased throughput compared to 2P microscopy.
The goal of this proposal is to validate WF OMI techniques for PDCOs that can be widely used for patient
treatment planning, heterogeneity analyses, and new drug development. OMI non-invasively images
response in a 3D sample using the intrinsic fluorescence of the metabolic co-enzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. OMI
can dynamically quantify heterogeneous drug response over a treatment time-course. We have and will continue
to develop hundreds of PDCO lines from metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. These cultures will be
used to validate new methods for more widely accessible OMI tools to predict patient response, identify
metabolic/genetic heterogeneity that underlies resistance to targeted therapy, and perform screens of new drug
candidates. The completion of this work will create technologies to perform high-sensitivity patient-matched drug
screens in a clinical setting, predict the evolution of drug resistance for individual patients, and perform new drug
development in samples that reflect the diversity of human cancers."

Through this RIVER proposal, I seek support to characterize and understand early biological responses that
anticipate age-related disease, which typically develops from exposures that occurred much earlier in life. My
primary focus will be on the effects of air pollution on accelerated brain aging, a major interest of my lab.
Ambient air particulate pollution has been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. Because of
the strong age dependence of dementia, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. For
effectively preventing such effects, we need to develop biomarkers that reflect not only adverse exposures, but
also preclinical effects on cognitive function and brain health deterioration. That is, we need to find easy-to-use
tools to detect the impact of air pollution and the beginnings of cognitive decline before they manifest fully.
To address this urgent clinical and public health need, I propose a series of coordinated human and in vitro
studies of an underappreciated cellular communication system enabled by extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs
are nano-sized (0.05–1 μm) membrane-bound vesicles released by human cells into the bloodstream that
contain cargo, such as microRNAs, that can be integrated into recipient cells and modify their biology. We
have built capacity to isolate circulating EVs based on their source cell type (SCT) using surface markers that
EVs derive from the cells that released them. These new methods will enable my lab to identify signals from
the precise cell types and organs affected by the exposures. We will apply these new methods to large cohort
studies with existing blood samples and clinical data collected longitudinally at multiple time points over
decades of follow-up to identify specific communication routes mediating the adverse effects of air pollution on
the brain. Based on preliminary evidence and pilot data, my hypothesis is that circulating EVs released by the
lung in response to air pollution carry signals, including microRNAs, that can that reach the brain and
accelerate brain aging. In parallel, we will conduct in vitro studies investigating how EVs released by the lung in
response to air pollution affect brain function using human bronchial epithelial cell cultures and cultured 3D
brain organoids—a novel model that can be used to study the neurodegenerative processes underlying age-
related brain health deterioration. Further, I will apply current data science techniques to identify patterns
activated by environmental exposures and predictive of future health outcomes.
I am confident that I can successfully lead this program. Over the last 10 years, I served as (M)PI on 16 NIH-
funded awards. My work has produced >450 publications, and I was recently recognized as one of the highest
cited, most influential investigators of the past decade. I have demonstrated a broad vision and made seminal
contributions to the understanding of molecular mechanisms, including EVs, that are part of homeostatic
alterations caused by environmental exposures. The flexible and sustained RIVER support will help continue a
highly successful record of innovation and leadership in environmental health sciences."
10932469,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms of how cells respond to changing environmental cues and 
integrate various signals, especially in the context of an intricate tissue or organism, is a major challenge. In 
the mammalian intestine, inputs from diet and the commensal microbiota can occur in the form of metabolites 
that act on neighboring intestinal epithelial cells and impact physiology. One such class of metabolites are 
short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are generated by microbes through the breakdown of dietary fiber. 
Recently, SCFAs have been detected as chemical modifications on histone proteins, called histone 
acylations. While certain histone acylations have been reported to positively regulate transcription, including 
the well-studied histone acetylation, the mechanistic functional role of other acyl marks and especially their 
physiological roles, are largely unknown. In addition, alterations in the chromatin landscape can have 
consequences on the regulation of gene expression and downstream cellular functions. Thus, my overall 
goal is to gain mechanistic understanding of how histone acylations are regulated and govern cell function in 
vivo. My central hypothesis is that different histone acylations have distinct functions in gene regulation 
through playing different roles in particular tissues and gene sets, and that exogenous cues regulate the 
balance of histone acylations that can drive cellular phenotypes. I will use the murine intestinal tract as a 
model system, which will likely elucidate physiological functions and delineate regulatory mechanisms of 
histone acyl marks. During the mentored phase of this award, I focused on the following Aims: (1) Studying 
how acyl reader complexes regulate gene expression under particular cell contexts, (2) Determining how 
histone acylations regulate intestinal epithelial cell fate. In this next independent phase of this award, I will 
continue studying mechanisms of how different acyl marks are regulated and focus on Aim 3: Investigating 
the regulation of histone acylations through cellular metabolism. This proposed work will utilize skills built 
during my postdoctoral training and the mentored phase of this award to foster my success as an independent 
scientist. Together, completion of this research proposal will elucidate the connection between metabolism 
and chromatin and further advance our understanding of the physiological roles of novel histone acyl marks."
10991749,"The discovery of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems led to
creative new applications that are transforming science and medicine. However, the rapid discovery of
new CRISPR systems outpaces our understanding of their biological roles in anti-phage defense and their
development for novel applications. To acquire immunity to new phages, CRISPR-associated proteins
(Cas1 and Cas2) integrate fragments of phage DNA (""spacers"") at the ""leader-end"" of the CRISPR locus,
near the transcription start site. But how Cas1-2 recognizes the leader-end of the CRISPR remains poorly
understood. Next, the CRISPR locus is transcribed and processed into ""guide RNAs"" that are loaded into
surveillance complexes (i.e., Csm complex). Upon sensing viral RNA, the Csm complex makes cyclic
oligonucleotide messengers that regulate CRISPR adaptation and nucleases critical for phage defense.
But the biological roles of many of these immune effectors remain understudied. The 1961 discovery of
regulatory DNA motifs kindled an interest in the ""grammatical rules"" of DNA motifs that control the storage
and retrieval of genetic information. In Aim 1, I will use a bioinformatic approach to discover DNA motifs in
CRISPR leaders with highly conserved sequences and positions, that I hypothesize regulate key steps in
CRISPR biology such as integration, transcription, or RNA processing. I will determine the role of novel
DNA motifs and host factors in CRISPR integration using in vitro biochemical assays and cryo-EM
structural biology. Nucleotide messengers regulate critical cellular processes across the tree of life,
including anti-viral immune responses, cell morphology, and motility. To address a growing need for rapid
and sensitive diagnostics, I co-invented an innovative RNA-guided Csm system for sensitive and
sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, that repurposes a nuclease immune effector. However,
nucleases represent a fraction of the diversity of enzymatic activities predicted to be activated by
nucleotide messengers. In Aim 2, I will determine a biochemical and structural understanding of novel
immune proteins that I predict to be activated by CRISPR-generated nucleotide messengers.The
long-term objectives of this proposal are to address knowledge gaps in our understanding of how bacterial
CRISPR adaptive immune systems function and are regulated, and to repurpose basic mechanistic
insights for the development of biotech and medical applications."

This administrative supplement to our U01HG114479 aims to support research to develop an evidence base
that will inform future policy directions on the utilization of electronic health records (EHR) including linkage
with potentially sensitive genomic data in pediatric research in Uganda and Botswana amidst a dynamic
consent landscape. Therefore, this project is specific to bioethics research in pediatrics. Pediatric research
is crucial for advancing healthcare but presents unique bioethical challenges due to children's evolving
capacity for assent and evolving consent processes. Data science holds promise for improving child health
outcomes in Africa but raises concerns regarding ethical considerations with pediatric EHR and genomic data
linkage. This study aims to address two bioethical questions: 1) the ethical, legal, and policy (ELP) issues of
using pediatric EHR data in research, and 2) the implications for consent and privacy when linking genomic
data with EHR in pediatrics research. In Aim 1 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and
document analysis will evaluate informed consent, data sharing practices, and vulnerabilities of children in
Ugandan and Botswanan research using EHR data. We will assess ELP considerations for pre-existing EHR
data use, including anonymization, governance, and secondary use ethics. In Aim 2 a discrete choice
experiment survey will assess public and researcher preferences regarding consent and privacy issues when
linking potentially sensitive genomic data with EHR in pediatric research. This study will provide evidence-
based recommendations to address ELP challenges and navigate the ethical landscape of data linkage in
African pediatric research. It will inform policymakers and researchers on promoting informed consent, robust
data governance, and participant privacy in data-driven research. Ultimately, this project strengthens the
bioethics research capacity for data science in Africa."

Cancer is a common diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) and by the time patients reach the ED, their cancer has
often progressed to later stages. Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer with poor overall survival largely attributed to late
stage at diagnosis and associated comorbidities, particularly among patients with disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic
backgrounds. In preliminary analysis of the parent grant, lung cancer was the most common cancer associated with
emergency diagnosis, late-stage diagnosis, and comorbidities. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another
smoking related disease, is a common comorbidity and a competing cause of death among patients with lung cancer.
COPD is sometimes complicated by acute exacerbations (AECOPD) that increase disease severity, lung cancer risk and
ED visits. However, little is known about the predictors and outcomes of emergency diagnosed lung cancer (EDLC)
among patients with COPD, especially among those of racial minorities and low socioeconomic status. Further, previous
population-based studies failed to account for important determinants of lung cancer outcomes such as COPD severity and
smoking. Filling a gap in the scope of the parent grant, the proposed supplement will examine the burden and outcomes of
emergency diagnosis of lung cancer (EDLC), as the top emergency diagnosed cancer, with a special emphasis on
comorbid COPD, a condition that affects up to 70% of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients and the exacerbation of
which may precipitate emergency lung cancer diagnosis. First, we will quantify the association between EDLC and
COPD, accounting for smoking, severity of COPD, other comorbidities, and frailty, overall and stratified by race/ethnicity
and socioeconomic status (SES). Second, we will quantify healthcare utilization of lung cancer staging and treatment for
patients with and without EDLC and whether it varies by COPD status, race/ ethnicity, and SES. Third, we will identify
predictors of 1-yr and 3-yr survival after EDLC including patient characteristics and receipt of guideline concordant
treatment. These study aims are nested within the parent grant R01CA264176 using the Surveillance Epidemiology and
End Results Data linked to Medicare data (SEER-Medicare) for Medicare beneficiaries who were diagnosed with lung
cancer between 2008 and 2017. The diversity candidate, Dr. Eman Metwally, is an African American postdoctoral fellow
with a background in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. Through the proposed supplement, Dr. Metwally will gain
skills in healthcare services research, cancer epidemiology, and professional development. Training and findings obtained
from completion of this supplement will result in scientific publications and presentations, skills required to successfully
compete for grant funding, and uniquely position Dr. Metwally to become an independent researcher in lung cancer
epidemiology."
11071345,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Sensitive periods are periods during early windows of development in external experiences or exposures
can shape patterns of connectivity and behavior later in life. Such periods allow for circuit maturation to adapt to
environmental factors but also confer risk for psychiatric disorders. Indeed, previous work in our lab has shown
that suppressing the activity of prefrontal parvalbumin-expressing (PFC PV) interneurons during postnatal day
14 to 32 (P14-P32) results in impaired neural connectivity, network function and PFC-dependent cognitive
flexibility later in life. Cognitive inflexibility and PFC dysfunction are both hallmarks of various psychiatric
illnesses, whose origins are often rooted in development. Thus, it is pivotal to understand the factors that
influence the activity of developing PFC PV interneurons, leading to alterations in PFC circuit remodeling.
 The neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) is well positioned to influence the activity of developing PFC PV
cells. Indeed, the PFC is densely innervated by 5-HT and 5-HT receptors can be detected in the developing
PFC. Additionally, 5-HT modulates PFC PV activity in adulthood. Moreover, 5-HT release in development,
which can be caused various external and genetic factors, versus adulthood yields opposing effects on adult
cognition. For instance, increases in 5-HT release into the PFC in adulthood improves cognitive flexibility, and I
have demonstrated that potentiating 5-HT release in development (P12-21) impairs adult cognitive flexibility. I
hypothesize that P14-21 is a sensitive period during which potentiating 5-HT signaling may suppress PV
excitability with long-lasting consequences for cognitive behavior.
 My experiments are designed to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the developmental trajectories of
complex cognitive behavior and identify early risk factors of mental illness. In Aim 1, I investigate the direct
effects of 5-HT on developing PFC PV excitability by employing slice electrophysiology. In Aim 2, I examine
the net effects of 5-HT release into the PFC on PV interneuron activity using an in vivo model, optogenetics
and fiber photometry. With these experiments, I will test the hypothesis that 5-HT release during development
suppresses the activity of PFC PV interneurons and shifts into exciting PV in adulthood. In Aim 3, I evaluate
how 5-HT potentiation to the PFC alters cognitive flexibility using chemogenetics and cognitive flexibility
assays. With this experiment, I will test the hypothesis that developmental potentiation 5-HT release into the
PFC is sufficient and necessary to produce cognitive inflexibility.
 Overall, my goal for this proposal is to better understand how factors that affect 5-HT levels impact PFC
development and PFC-dependent cognitive behavior later in life. As PV interneurons are critical for PFC
maturation, their interactions with 5-HT may constitute important markers preceding the onset of disease."

Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is a pediatric speech sound disorder (SSD) that impacts between 60,000
and 780,000 children under 14 in the US. The underlying impairment in speech motor planning primarily affects
articulation and prosody and reduces intelligibility. Beyond impaired communication, children diagnosed with
CAS are also at higher risk for difficulties with social/emotional development and reading and writing. Thus,
effective targeted intervention is warranted for these children. However, CAS diagnosis is difficult and at present
relies primarily on the `gold standard' clinical judgment by an `expert speech-language pathologist (SLP)' based
on a number of perceptual features: (a) Inconsistent errors, (b) impaired transitions between sounds and
syllables, and (c) impaired prosody, in particular lexical stress.
 This diagnostic standard is problematic for several reasons, including the fact that these features are not
operationalized (in terms of elicitation, measures, number of instances required for diagnosis), lack precision,
and vary with the SLP's language and clinical experience. These challenges are exacerbated by the well-known
heterogeneity of CAS presentation and the overlap with other SSDs. Finally, there are no standards or criteria
by which an SLP is considered an `expert'. Together, these major limitations lead to disagreements between
SLPs and reluctance by some SLPs, especially less experienced ones, to diagnose CAS. This undermines the
ability to make well-informed evidence-based clinical decisions for children with CAS and other SSDs. In addition,
the research literature on CAS has been hampered for decades by this diagnostic problem, and is compounded
by small sample sizes. More objective, validated, precise, replicable, and clinically feasible diagnostic measures
are sorely needed. Acoustic measures have strong potential to meet these needs, based on prior small-scale
studies in CAS and studies with other populations with speech disorders. However, to date no studies have
systematically examined acoustic measures of core perceptual CAS features in a single study.
 This F31 proposal leverages a unique, large and well-characterized retrospective dataset of 125 children (76
with CAS, 28 with another SSD, and 21 without any SSD) to systematically examine the validity of a well-
motivated set of acoustic measures of each core perceptual feature (3 acoustic measures each) (Aim 1), the
differential diagnostic accuracy of the three acoustic measures with highest validity (1 acoustic measure per
feature) (Aim 2), and the potential identification of CAS subtypes based on these acoustic measures (Aim 3). As
a first step, the diagnostic accuracy of these acoustic measures will be evaluated against a gold standard of an
operationalized consensus criterion based on independent judgments from 3 expert SLPs. This F31 project will
provide novel, unique, and significant information that will help improve clinical diagnosis of CAS and other SSDs,
provide the Fellow with advanced training to transition toward an independent research career, and set the stage
for a future prospective validation study of the acoustic measures found most promising here."
11070453,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emotion dysregulation, defined as the inability to regulate the intensity and quality of emotions, is a common
transdiagnostic symptom of mood disorders in early adolescence and a major risk factor for youth suicide.
Evidence indicates that sleep disruption may be a driver of emotion dysregulation, and that sleep indices such
as poor sleep efficiency – a greater time spent awake during attempted sleep – both precede and predict the
onset of mood disorders. It is therefore critical to understand the neurodevelopmental mechanisms through which
sleep disruption relates to emotion dysregulation during adolescence. Prior studies have linked alterations in the
Default Mode Network (DMN) to both sleep disruption and emotion dysregulation. In parallel, findings indicate
that sleep significantly impacts synaptic plasticity mechanisms crucial for brain maturation. Importantly, the
protracted maturational program of the DMN may render this network particularly vulnerable to sleep disruption
during adolescence; however, this has not been directly tested. Recent methodological advances provide a
strong premise for the relevance of low frequency fMRI fluctuation amplitude as a non-invasive marker of
developmental plasticity. Using this measure, our lab recently demonstrated a period of increased plasticity in
the DMN during early to mid-adolescence, indicating that the DMN is highly malleable during this period.
However, no work has comprehensively characterized the impact of sleep disruption on DMN developmental
plasticity and emotion dysregulation in humans. In response to this gap, the current proposal will test the
overarching hypothesis that poor sleep efficiency in early to mid-adolescence blunts developmental plasticity in
the DMN and is associated with emotion dysregulation. To test this, the current proposal will apply advanced
neuroimaging approaches to two complementary datasets. In Aim 1, cross-sectional relationships between sleep
efficiency, emotion dysregulation, and DMN plasticity will be defined in a prospectively collected sample (ages
11-16) of 100 individuals with mood disorders and 50 typically developing comparators. This sample will include
high-precision phenotyping not available in large-scale data, including digital phenotyping of emotion regulation
and next generation multi-echo fMRI sequences that enhance sensitivity. Aim 2 will delineate how sleep
efficiency impacts longitudinal development of plasticity in the DMN and emotion dysregulation by leveraging the
large-scale longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (ages 11-16). Both datasets will
include wristwatch-recorded sleep, providing objective measures of sleep efficiency. Taken together, findings
will provide critical new insights into the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of sleep disruption and emotion
dysregulation. Supported by a strong mentorship team with complementary expertise (Drs. Satterthwaite,
Mackey, Gehrman, Shou, and Barch) and the world-class resources of the University of Pennsylvania, this
proposal aligns with a cohesive training plan that will form the ideal foundation for an independent career at the
intersection of neurodevelopment, sleep, and computational psychiatry.

Doxorubicin is a member of the anthracycline group of chemotherapy drugs prescribed to approximately 60% of
pediatric cancer patients suffering with sarcomas, blastomas, leukemia, and lymphoma. Although doxorubicin is
highly effective in these patients, ~16% of pediatric patients suffer doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) which
can lead to heart failure requiring heart transplant. Our recent work has shown that DIC is 2.5x more
prevalent in African American (AA) survivors of childhood cancer. Despite more than 50 years of research
in this field, there is still, at present, little potential for either predicting or preventing DIC. There is an obvious
need for novel and innovative approaches to overcome this hurdle. Candidate gene and genome-wide
association studies, predominantly in Europeans, have identified >100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are statistically correlated with DIC, yet experimental validation has not been feasible due to the difficulty in
isolating and culturing human cardiomyocytes in vitro. In our recent work, we showed that patient-specific human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are efficient predictors of a patient’s
likelihood of developing DIC, confirming for the first time that there is a genomic basis to DIC. Here, we
hypothesize that hiPSC-CMs can be utilized in three different modalities to study genetic variants associated
with DIC in AA survivors: firstly, to discover novel predictive SNPs; secondly, to validate SNPs; and thirdly, to
examine the modulated pathways and determine genotype-specific cardioprotective methodologies. In Aim 1,
we will generate hiPSC from 100 AA adult survivors of childhood cancer with diverse biological covariates who
were exposed to doxorubicin assess their response to doxorubicin in vitro to validate our previous findings and
verify the power of this tool. In Aim 2, we will use these 100 patient-specific lines to identify drug response
differential expression, splicing and chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (deQTL, dsQTL and dcaQTL),
assessing biological covariates such as doxorubicin dose, age at cancer diagnosis, attained age, sex, BMI,
radiotherapy (other than involving chest), and cancer diagnosis both individually and combined. We will then
validate these variants with genome editing, and mechanistically examine pathways causative to DIC
susceptibility concentrating on genes with known roles in cardiomyopathy, cardioprotection, and doxorubicin
metabolism. We will then use the discoveries above to discover/repurpose genome-informed cardioprotective
drugs to prevent DIC in a genotype-specific manner. In Aim 3, we will build a risk prediction model for DIC among
AA survivors incorporating clinical risk factors and functionally assessed genetic variants above, evaluate its
prediction performance, validate it in independent AA survivors, and implement it in a web-based and user-
friendly tool for broader clinical and research use. In summary, this work will deliver us the genetic rationale for
why AA survivors experience DIC and provide 1, fully human validated SNP data for clinical application through
a user-friendly tool, and 2, novel cardioprotective pathways that can be targeted to protect against DIC."
11059723,"ABSTRACT
Tumor suppressor p53 is the quintessential guardian of the genome whose function is inhibited in greater than
50% of all human cancers. Though mutation and deletion of p53 are major contributors to p53 inactivation,
overexpression of the negative regulators MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX) are also known to inactivate p53, thus
leading to the cancer phenotype. Our lab has shown that specific types of cell stress initiate the generation of
an alternatively spliced isoform of MDM2. The predominant MDM2 alternative isoform, MDM2-ALT1 also
known as MDM2-B, functions to primarily activate the p53 pathway by inhibiting MDM2 and MDM4 in a
dominant negative fashion. Paradoxically, this isoform is upregulated in several human cancers, such as
pediatric high-grade gliomas, astrocytomas, rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), and liposarcomas, as well as adult
cancers such as lymphomas and those of the breast. Thus, MDM2-ALT1 plays opposing roles in cancer
progression dependent upon the context of its expression. In the proposed research, we will study the
underpinnings of the control of the p53 pathway by MDM2-ALT1 to better understand 1) the specific
mechanism by which that MDM2-ALT1 is generated in cancer and 2) the ability of the resultant isoforms to be
targeted using splice-switching oligonucleotides. We hypothesize that the expression of oncogenic MDM2-
ALT1 is modulated by alterations in protein and RNA nuclear factors during the progression to tumorigenesis
and can be targeted to induce splicing changes. We will use assays that identify and measure splice regulation
in conjunction with gene editing approaches to identify RNA sequences and their respective nuclear factor-
binding partners necessary for regulation of MDM2 splicing. Furthermore, we will use novel genetically
engineered mouse models as well as established mouse xenograft assays and novel splice switching
oligonucleotides (SSOs) to modulate MDM2 isoform levels. Our work will broaden our knowledge of
combinatorial regulation of RNA processing in response to stress and in cancer and interrogate the utility of
MDM2 isoforms modulation for rational control of the p53 pathway."
11059724,"Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI, chemobrain), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) and gait changes are debilitating side-effects of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin),
taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian malignancies.
Over 70% of women report experiencing CRCI, CIPN and/or falls during treatment or after completion, impairing
their quality of life. These neurotoxic impairments can also compromise treatment with cisplatin, influencing
 disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA-approved clinical interventions for the treatment of CRCI and
CIPN. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced neuronal toxicity derives from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage,
and oxidative stress, which induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary data show that in vitro
pharmacological inhibition with small molecule inhibitors, i.e., neflamapimod for p38MAPK and SP600125 for
JNK, prevents cisplatin-induced reduction in dendritic spine branching and density. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that inhibition of the p38MAPK/JNK pathways will prevent cisplatin-induced neuronal
apoptosis and damage, leading to attenuation of cognitive impairments, gait changes, and neuropathic
pain associated with CRCI and CIPN. In this project, we propose to determine if: (1) cisplatin-induced p38
MAPK/JNK signaling underlies structural and functional neuronal damage, using in vitro pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA silencing; (2) neflamapimod and SP600125 prevent cisplatin-induced neuropathy and gait
alterations in the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer in C57BL/6 mice and the transgenic breast cancer
model C3TAg in FVBN mice; and (3) cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by p38MAPK/JNK inhibition
without compromising its anti-cancer activity. Our Approach includes in vitro analysis of 2 separate neuronal cell
 lines, behavioral analysis using sensory testing for CIPN, testing of cognitive impairment, and novel
MouseWalker for gait changes in female mice using the two mouse cancer models. The proposed studies will
demonstrate the role of the p38MAPK and JNK in cisplatin induced CRCI/CIPN, and translational potential for
novel strategies to treat CRCI and CIPN. Due to health disparities, women suffer more disproportionately from
cancer and pain-related treatment than men. Therefore, testing our hypothesis in female mice is expected to
significantly advance the understanding and treatment of cisplatin-induced neurotoxic side effects and improve
the quality of life for women with cancer. Nevertheless, we expect that these findings may also apply to cisplatin-
 induced neurotoxicity in males and to other cancers than ovarian and breast cancers."

Tricuspid regurgitation is a very common etiology of valvular cardiomyopathy. In the United States alone, there
are an estimated 1.3 million patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation carries
an ominous prognosis as observational data demonstrate 1-year mortality rates are as high as 46%. At
present, there are no effective therapeutics that counteract the cardiac effects of tricuspid regurgitation, and
treatment consists of diuretics for volume overload or surgical correction. Surgical treatment is both high risk
and quite costly. The in-hospital mortality for surgical repair of tricuspid regurgitation remains at 8-10%, and the
average cost of hospitalization is >$80,000. Both medical and surgical treatment of tricuspid regurgitation is
difficult because tricuspid regurgitation compromises both right atrial and right ventricular function due to
continual volume overload, but the mechanisms underlying the pathological changes in each chamber are
undefined. These key unanswered questions will be addressed in this proposal.
One barrier to understanding the detrimental molecular effects of tricuspid regurgitation on the right atrium and
right ventricle is the lack of robust animal models of severe tricuspid regurgitation. Rodent models of valvular
cardiomyopathy are limited because it is technically challenging to induce valve disease due to the small size
of the animals. In addition, evaluation of right atrial and ventricular structure and function in rodents can be
quite challenging even with the most experienced echocardiographer. Finally, mice and rats do not provide
sufficient tissue to perform multi-omics studies, which has further hampered our ability to gain mechanistic
insights. Large animal models may circumvent some of these challenges, and offer additional advantages, as
they are widely believed to better recapitulate human physiology. However, a large animal model of severe
tricuspid regurgitation is lacking, but our supplement will close this important knowledge gap.
In our preliminary studies, we show endovascular-mediated damage of the tricuspid valve results in significant
tricuspid regurgitation and right heart remodeling. When comparing right atrial and ventricular volumes of two
pigs to our historic controls, we observed significant right heart remodeling with increased right atrial and right
ventricular end-diastolic volumes. Thus, we provide proof of principle data that we have generated a large
animal model of severe tricuspid regurgitation, and this lays the groundwork for further mechanistic and multi-
omic exploration of this highly translational model.
In this supplemental proposal, we will further refine our porcine model of severe tricuspid regurgitation and
then perform a deep molecular phenotypic evaluation of both the right atrium and right ventricle to delineate
the molecular underpinnings of right heart remodeling. Then, we will compare and contrast the effects of right
ventricular pressure (pulmonary artery banding) and volume overload (severe tricuspid regurgitation) on the
right atria and ventricle using tissue we have developed in our parent R01 in the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Develop a porcine model of severe tricuspid regurgitation and define its effects on
right atrial and right ventricular structure and function with cardiac MRI analysis. In this Aim, we will
comprehensively evaluate the effects of severe tricuspid regurgitation on right atrial and right ventricular
structure and function in male and female pigs using 3.0 Tesla cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We will
also perform flow and velocity encoding analysis to quantify how this model modulates venous flow in the
inferior vena cava to further validate the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
Specific Aim 2: Perform a multi-omic analysis of the right atrium and right ventricle and compare the
molecular responses between RV volume and pressure overload. Using tissue from our newly developed
model and available tissue from our parent project-generated RV pressure overload model (pulmonary artery
banding), we will perform histological, proteomics, metabolomics, and single-nucleus RNAseq analyses of right
atrial and ventricular tissues. Then, we will compare the pathogenic proteomic, metabolomic, and cellular
landscape changes in the right atrium and ventricle so we can define how pressure and volume overload
impart either similar or distinct pathogenic changes in each chamber.
This supplement will provide the field with a new and highly translational model of severe tricuspid
regurgitation, and allow us to gain new insights into this common and very morbid condition.

Infectious diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis and sepsis, are associated with significant patient mor-
bidity and mortality. Because of their public health significance, recent research in artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML) have explored how deep learning models may be used as clinical decision support tools
to work alongside clinicians in improving patient care. However, it is well-documented that AI algorithms—even
those approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—are inaccurate and perform poorly on real-world pa-
tients, especially those from minority backgrounds. As a result, such tools often inadvertently propagate existing
biases due to their poor performance on historically marginalized patient populations. Especially in high-stakes
applications such as healthcare where there is a small margin for error, it is important to train neural networks
that are clinically interpretable, trustworthy, and reliable even for patients from underrepresented backgrounds.
The reasons behind biased model performance are complex, but can be largely distilled into two major causes
of algorithmic bias: (1) black-box predictive models may not be well-calibrated with true clinical decision-making
used by physicians; and (2) minority patients are underrepresented in model training datasets. In this work, I
propose a series of algorithmic and practical innovations to address these two root causes of algorithmic
bias in the clinical diagnosis and management of pulmonary tuberculosis and sepsis. I will accomplish this
task by increasing the accessibility and reliability of AI models for traditionally marginalized patient populations.
Firstly, in order to better align predictive models with clinical reasoning for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis,
I will show how publicly available vision-language foundational models can be used to improve the diagnostic
accuracy of clinicians in resource-limited settings (Aim 1). Secondly, I will propose and validate a novel
computational algorithm that leverages historical aggregate patient data to better inform the clinical care of
minority patients diagnosed with sepsis (Aim 2). These experiments will collectively demonstrate how AI al-
gorithms can be better leveraged for various applications spanning multiple domains of patient care. In providing
solutions for these clinically relevant problems, I will further develop the technical skills and scientific reasoning
needed as a future radiologist and academic researcher in machine learning. I look forward to leveraging both
my graduate education and clinical training together to ultimately become a well-rounded physician-scientist and
independent investigator."

Congenital Melanocytic Nevi (CMN) can reach giant sizes, transform to melanoma during childhood, and
therefore trigger pre-emptive surgery with permanent profound morbidity. During the prior funding period, we
constructed four CMN models to test regression-inducing treatments to avoid surgery. Three were genetically
engineered mice driven by the (floxed)NRASQ61R oncogene, responsible for most human CMN, with melanocyte-
targeting via tamoxifen-inducible or constitutive expression from Tyr or Dct promoters. The fourth model
employed xenografts of human CMNs on immunodeficient mice. Two models displayed substantial
transformation to melanoma after long latency. Inducible modeling clarified the proliferative vs senescent nevus
phases and verified that treatment can be successful in either. Combination with constitutive Tyr-Cre triggered
severe (rare, human-like) neurocutaneous melanosis whereas Dct-Cre induced more typical skin-restricted giant
nevi for which inhibitors of MEK, PI3K, or cKIT induced ~80% regressions whereas combinations fully depleted
visual nevocytes. Topical treatment with the proinflammatory hapten Squaric Acid Dibutyl Ester (SADBE)
induced complete visual regression of CMNs after 3 topical doses over 5 days. This regimen also produced
100% prevention of murine melanoma transformation, but not in untreated nevus skin. Topical SADBE was
found to utilize macrophages (not B/T cells), so it could be tested in human CMN xenografted onto SHO mice
(no B/T cells but contains macrophages) where SADBE recruited murine macrophages and regressed ~90% of
human nevocytes. Since SADBE is already used elsewhere in dermatology, and has been reported to induce
“depigmentation,” we obtained FDA (IND) approval for human testing (FDA required adult testing prior to children)
and also local IRB approval. Aim 1 is a neoadjuvant CMN clinical trial testing topical SADBE or vehicle prior to
elective surgical resection, followed by detailed assessments of nevocyte numbers, oncogene drivers, and
inflammatory cells; Aim 2 uses our models to boldly seek further enhanced efficacy and minimize toxicity through
six strategies: a) dose/schedule optimization of kinase inhibitors and combinations, b) combine MEK inhibitor
(MEKi) with SADBE, as both exhibit individual efficacy; of note, MEKi was recently shown to promote M1-like
over M2-like macrophage polarization, thereby plausibly enhancing SADBE efficacy, c) combine SADBE with
anti-PD1, shown to trigger recruitment of melanocyte targeting T cells, d) combine SADBE with fractional laser
plus anti-PD1 which was recently published to recruit melanocyte-targeted T cells, and e) combine anti-
inflammatory agents and varied dose/schedules to limit cutaneous toxicity while optimizing efficacy."

 Reading is vital to life in modern society. Loss of reading ability due to stroke, or alexia, affects approximately
1.3 million Americans and recovery is often incomplete. Reading relies on an area of the brain’s object
recognition system that becomes specialized for word recognition as we learn to read, called the visual word for
area (VWFA). Because reading is a learned skill, it relies on input from the VWFA into brain networks evolved
for more general speech and language processing. There is some evidence that the VWFA also receives top-
down information from language regions, but the importance of this feedback for reading is poorly understood.
Most cases of alexia are caused by strokes to the language network, not the VWFA, raising the question of
whether reading deficits in alexia relate to aberrant VWFA processing caused by disrupted feedback from the
language network. Here, I propose to investigate the hypothesis that damage to the language network causes
dysfunction and triggers plastic changes in visual word processing areas undamaged by the stroke, and that
these changes correspond with reading deficits after stroke.
 Further, the brain basis of alexia recovery is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that both
spared left hemisphere (LH) language regions and their right hemisphere (RH) homotopes contribute to aphasia
recovery, but the role of the RH homotope of the VWFA (rVWFA) in alexia recovery has only been tested in a
few case studies, and only with direct damage to the LH VWFA. I hypothesize that the rVWFA is recruited in
some cases of alexia caused by lesions to the language network, and that this recruitment contributes to reading
performance after stroke, particularly for word comprehension.
 To test these hypotheses, this prospective study of 40 chronic left hemisphere stroke survivors and 40
demographically matched controls will identify post-stroke functional changes to the canonical left hemisphere
VWFA (lVWFA) and the rVWFA (Aim 1), determine the relationship of VWFA activity to lesion locations and
disconnections (Aim 2) and examine how this activity relates to reading deficits after stroke (Aim 3). Aim 1 will
employ a novel fMRI VWFA localizer I designed to characterize activity in the lVWFA and rVWFA. Aim 2 will
conduct voxelwise and structural connectome-based multivariate lesion-symptom mapping analyses to elucidate
brain regions and disconnects related to atypical VWFA activity. Aim 3 will employ a hierarchical regression
approach to determine the relationship of VWFA activity to deficits in oral word reading, silent word recognition,
and silent word comprehension. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the interplay between
language regions and visual word processing areas, and of the brain basis of alexia and alexia recovery. By
completing this project and the associated training plan, I will learn to conduct fMRI and behavioral research in
people with alexia and aphasia, which is key to my ultimate goal of developing into an independent investigator
studying mechanisms of neural plasticity in higher cognitive functions after injury."

This supplementary project aims to uncover the mechanisms and implications of mitochondria transfer between
immune cells and cancer cells via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), specifically focusing on the potential of inhibiting
these transfers to boost the efficacy of immunotherapies against cancer. Through the development and
application of 2D and 3D models, the study intends to explore how these mitochondrial transfers affect cancer
cell behavior across various macrophage phenotypes under different experimental conditions. A central goal of
the research is to assess the effectiveness and safety of nanotube inhibitors, thus providing new insights into
their potential to enhance current immune checkpoint therapies by disrupting TNT-mediated interactions between
cancer and immune cells.
Structured into three aims, the project will first characterize mitochondria trafficking between cancer cells and
macrophages via TNTs, focusing on the influence of macrophage phenotypes on cancer cell fate. This aim is
critical for understanding the nanotube-mediated mechanisms that cancer cells may use to evade immune
responses, potentially undermining the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The second aim will
develop 3D models that more accurately mimic physiological conditions for studying TNT dynamics than
traditional 2D models. This is vital for gaining insights into the unique structural and functional properties of TNTs
in 3D environments, especially regarding their interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its significant
impact on TNT formation and functionality. The final aim evaluates the efficacy of various nanotube inhibitors,
including those targeting the exocyst complex, in preventing TNT formation and mitochondrial transfer between
cancer cells and macrophages. This includes examining the effects of these inhibitors on macrophage immune
responses to cancer cells, with the overarching objective of enhancing anti-cancer immune activities in 3D
models.
This project addresses the gap in understanding the role of macrophages in immune responses to cancer cells,
particularly focusing on nanotube-mediated mitochondrial transfer and its implications for immune evasion. By
exploring these interactions in various 2D and 3D settings, the research aims to uncover novel insights into the
dynamically-changing structural and functional characteristics of TNTs. This understanding is expected to aid in
creating targeted therapies that enhance immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy, contributing to the advancement
of cancer immunotherapy strategies."
11063030,"Project Summary/Abstract
As the population of childhood cancer survivors grows, the impact of long-term treatment-related side effects
also grows. Cancer treatments for children with leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) have long-lasting
toxic effects on the developing brain, known as neurocognitive late effects, which can impact the children’s
learning, function, and ability to achieve independence as adults. However, these problems are often untreated
in leukemia and LL survivors, creating a medically underserved population. Recognizing the impact of familial
factors on survivor outcomes, we designed a parent-directed training intervention (the high-intensity intervention
program, HIP), which teaches parents about brain development and neurocognitive late effects; trains them on
tools to improve their child’s behavior and cognitive functioning; provides tips for establishing better learning
environments and effective study habits; and helps them to manage stress for themselves and their children.
Pilot trials of the HIP in English- and Spanish-speaking families demonstrated efficacy but also revealed critical
barriers to success, including travel time and scheduling challenges. Digital health technologies offer
transformative solutions to improve the efficiency, quality, and convenience of healthcare delivery. However,
“eHealth” has not been applied to a parent-directed intervention to improve educational outcomes for children.
Therefore, we propose to test a new eHealth version of our English/Spanish intervention (HIP-eHealth) in a
randomized clinical trial of 166 parent/child dyads from 4 sites in California. HIP-eHealth addresses the remaining
barriers to HIP access and incorporates improvements recommended by parents in our earlier trials. We will
deliver HIP-eHealth from a single central site (City of Hope) through a HIPAA-compliant study website that hosts
Zoom videoconferencing for HIP sessions; digitized study content; supplemental multimedia content; links to the
award-winning IXL learning environment; gamification features and automated reminders to increase
engagement; and robust user analytics. Other advances include a streamlined 4-session program, an enhanced
booster phase, and greater inclusion of the children. We hypothesize that HIP-eHealth will produce greater
improvements in child and parent outcomes than a lower-intensity program (LIP) that mimics the usual care
provided to survivors of pediatric brain tumors (i.e., a single meeting to discuss the child’s neuropsychological
testing results and provide recommendations for optimal learning). Our study aims to: (1) Evaluate the
effectiveness of HIP-eHealth on the learning and school performance of pediatric cancer survivors; (2) Evaluate
the effectiveness of HIP-eHealth on the “pro-learning” efficacy of their parents; (3) Investigate the extent to which
the parents’ efficacy and/or children’s use of online learning activities is associated with changes in the children’s
school performance; and (4) Assess factors that impact the parents’ ability to complete the intervention. We
anticipate this study will help shape a scalable and effective therapy that is easily integrated into standard care."

Candidate: My long term goal is to become an independent investigator running an interdisciplinary and
collaborative research team to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of medications and drugs of
abuse on intra/interconnected brain circuits . Specifically, my interests surround understanding how cholinergic
interneurons (ChAT) regulate the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the local circuitry of
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), thereby underlying sex differences in dopamine signaling associated with reward
and motivated behavior. I have a strong background in electrophysiology and pharmacology, and propose to be
trained in optogenetics, behavioral pharmacology, and in vivo fiber photometry to round out my training. This will
provide me with the skills to produce high impact publications and successful R01 submissions. I received my
PhD in April of 2017 and this is currently my third year of postdoctoral research training.
Training: In addition to Dr. Calipari, I have an advisory committee of experts in academic research who will
provide the necessary training and guidance to accomplish this proposal. Dr. Barnett, is the Vice-chair of and a
Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Dr. McCabe is the Director of the Office of Postdoctoral
Affairs. Outside of the committee, we have identified, courses, seminars, and meetings to provide further
technical training, presentation experience, responsible conduct in research, and the necessary skills
(negotiations, tenure, laboratory management, etc.) to transition to independence.
Research: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic, recurring brain disease characterized by significant
dysfunction in reward-seeking behavior. A large body of work has focused on understanding the neural
mechanisms in the brain’s reward circuitry, yet these studies have overwhelmingly focused on male subjects.
Epidemiological evidence shows that women represent a particularly susceptible population to SUD, yet the
mechanisms in the brain that underlie sex differences in reward and motivation are largely unknown. The neural
control of reward is dependent on dopamine release in the NAc that is subject to heavy modulation by ChAT
signaling through nAChRs; a process that is essential to encoding information about environmental reward
predictive cues. My preliminary data show fundamental sex differences in the regulation of dopamine release
via nAChRs, yet to date, it is not known how this process occurs, what factors influence this effect, and how this
relates to motivated behavior. The overall goal of this proposal is to define sex-specific circuit-based
mechanisms governing sex differences in reward processing. By using voltammetry techniques along with
pharmacology, behavioral analysis, and in vivo dopamine recording, I anticipate being able to expand our
understanding of the sex differences in ChAT regulation of nAChR modulation of dopamine release underlying
reward learning. The successful completion of this proposed project has the potential to inform the development
of better and more effective pharmacotherapies to counter neurological disease states in women."

My career goal is to establish an independent aging research program focused on designing and evaluating
high quality, technology-based behavioral health interventions to improve self-management and quality of life
(QoL) of community-dwelling older adults, particularly older family care partners (FCPs). More than 17 million
FCPs, including family, friends, and relatives, provide care for older adults with chronic illness in the US. High
caregiving burden places FCPs at risk for physical function decline, psychological distress, and poor health
status. Specifically, older FCPs are more vulnerable than younger FCPs because of greater physical and
psychological burden, more age-related health care needs, and less emotional and social support. Physical
activity (PA) has the potential to promote the health and well-being of older FCPs. Because caregiving duties
limit FCPs to the home and preclude face-to-face interactions (more so during the COVID-19 pandemic), using
digital health technologies is an effective way to engage older FCPs in home-based PA interventions.
However, there is a gap in research for digital health PA interventions targeting older FCPs; I intend to fill this
gap. This K23 award will provide me with the protected time to acquire advanced skills and knowledge in (1)
design and implementation of clinical trials in older adults, (2) physical activity behavior change, (3) expansion
of health informatics, and (4) professional development for a successful independent research career. The
research environment at the University of Colorado, the interdisciplinary mentorship team I have assembled,
and support from the College of Nursing provide an exceptional training opportunity. The overall objective of
the proposed study is to rigorously design and test a tailored PA coaching program using digital health
technologies, TPA4You, and conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility of TPA4You and its effects on health
outcomes among older FCPs. Older FCPs of patients with heart failure (HF-FCPs) will be the focus of this
study because HF-FCPs are an understudied population that is vulnerable to their own health-related issues.
The specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) develop the TPA4You intervention by evaluating its technology
features (n=15; Year 1), (2) conduct field-testing of TPA4You to optimize usability and acceptability (n=20;
Year 2), and (3) conduct a pilot RCT to assess feasibility and preliminary effects of the TPA4You intervention
(n=62; Years 3-5). For Aim 1, using scenario-based design methods, we will elicit HF-FCPs’ perceptions about
the integrated technology components in one-on-one interviews. For Aim 2, we will iteratively enhance
TPA4You to meet HF-FCPs’ PA needs and optimize usability and acceptability. For Aim 3, older HF-FCPs will
be randomized to receive the TPA4You program or attention control for 12 weeks. This proposed study’s novel
TPA4You program has the potential to increase PA, and improve physical function, psychological outcomes,
and QoL among older HF-FCPs. This proposal will provide the foundation for an R01 efficacy study of the
TPA4You program in a larger, more diverse population of older HF-FCPs."
11071936,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health concern that has reached epidemic proportions,
affecting ~20 million individuals (~13.1% of the population) in the United States alone. Risk of cardiovascular
disease is significantly elevated among patients with CKD; however, this increased cardiovascular risk is only
partially explained by traditional risk factors. Vascular dysfunction including arterial stiffening, endothelial
dysfunction, and vascular calcification is a common and well-established risk factor and predictor of
cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality among individuals with CKD. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is
a secondary bile acid derived via gut bacteria transformation of the primary bile acid, cholic acid. In CKD, bile
acid levels are elevated and the proportion of DCA is increased compared to its primary bile acid precursor,
cholic acid. Data show that DCA is associated with vascular dysfunction, and it is directly toxic to vascular
smooth muscle cells inducing vascular calcification through endoplasmic reticulum stress. How circulating DCA
and other abundant bile acid (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) levels change as kidney
function declines needs further characterization. Moreover, whether circulating DCA and other bile acid (cholic
acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) levels are associated with meaningful clinical outcomes such as
cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality is unknown. The objective of this epidemiologic proposal
is to assess plasma DCA and other bile acid (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) levels across
a full spectrum of kidney function and evaluate the association of circulating DCA and other bile acid (cholic
acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) levels with cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality.
We will use baseline data collected from participants in the Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Standard
Blood-Pressure Control (SPRINT) and from participants in the Effect of Homocysteine Lowering on Mortality
and Vascular Disease in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease and End-stage Renal Disease (HOST). Together
these two unique cohorts include the full spectrum of kidney function from normal estimated glomerular
filtration rate to end-stage renal disease as well as adjudicated cardiovascular disease events and all-cause
mortality. The first aim is to measure levels of plasma DCA and other bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic
acid, lithocholic acid) among participants in SPRINT, which enrolled patients with normal kidney function and
mild-moderate CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 47 mL/min/1.73 m2), and participants in HOST,
which enrolled patients with severe CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 18 mL/min/1.73 m2) and
end-stage renal disease. The second aim is to evaluate the association of plasma DCA and other bile acid
(cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) levels with adjudicated cardiovascular disease events and
all-cause mortality. We hypothesize that elevated plasma levels of DCA and other bile acids (cholic acid,
chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) are common among individuals with CKD and will be associated with
greater risk of cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality. Previous observations suggest that
circulating DCA levels may be modified by diet, exercise, and bile acid sequestrants. Therefore, DCA may be a
target for intervention to reduce vascular dysfunction and calcification and improve cardiovascular disease
outcomes and premature mortality in CKD."

The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-producing oral commensal, Streptococcus parasanguinis, plays a major role in
maintaining oral homeostasis in a nitrite (NO2)-dependent manner. Specifically, salivary NO2 produced by nitrate-
reducing bacteria reacts with H2O2 to produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS), such as peroxynitrite (ONOO-),
which is an antimicrobial that targets diverse pathogens, such as Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis,
and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In S. parasanguinis the production of H2O2 is mediated by the
poxL (pyruvate oxidase) gene, which is homologous to the Streptococcus pneumoniae spxB gene. Multiple
studies have shown that in S. pneumoniae H2O2 production has an inverse relationship with capsule production.
Capsule production in S. pneumoniae is important for biofilm formation and oxidative stress resistance. However,
the relationship between capsule production and H2O2 production, oxidative stress tolerance, and biofilm
development remains unknown in S. parasanguinis. Additionally, the role of capsule in NO2-mediated nitrosative
stress tolerance remains unstudied. S. parasanguinis harbors a capsule biosynthesis (CPS) operon that is
homologous to the S. pneumoniae CPS operon, indicating that the roles of capsule may function in a similar
manner to S. pneumoniae as it pertains to fitness. CpsE, a galactosyl transferase, is required for initiating the
addition of the first monosaccharide in the formation of S. parasanguinis polysaccharide capsule biosynthesis.
The goal of this project is to characterize the role of S. parasanguinis CpsE in modulating H2O2 production, NO2-
mediated stress tolerance and biofilm formation, and commensal fitness within multispecies biofilms. We
hypothesize that capsule production plays a critically important role in S. parasanguinis biofilm formation, stress
response, and polymicrobial interactions. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Determine the role of capsule
production on S. parasanguinis biofilm development and stress tolerance, and 2) Determine the role of capsule
production on S. parasanguinis’ microbial competition. Ultimately, the completion of the proposed aims will
provide new knowledge about the role of capsule in oral commensal fitness, colonization, and ability to
antagonize oral pathogens, which has never been studied."
11071094,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a devastating condition that affects 29.5 million people aged 12 and older. AUD is
classically characterized by a loss of behavioral control, particularly in the face of negative consequences,
resulting in a loss of inhibitory control, or disinhibition, that may normally suppress alcohol seeking. Considering
this, it is critical to investigate mechanisms associated with disinhibition. One major barrier to investigating AUD
progression is understanding specific cell populations that may normally serve to suppress alcohol seeking but
become disinhibited following dependence. While our knowledge of neuronal ensembles in alcohol dependence
remains limited, studies on the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in
regulating sucrose seeking have revealed distinct neuronal ensembles that emerge across the course of
learning. These studies indicate that PVTàNAc encodes ensembles of inhibited neurons that function as a
“brake” on reward-seeking. Extending these findings to examine how alcohol influences thalamo-striatal neuronal
ensembles is imperative for targeting inhibitory ensembles that may attenuate alcohol-seeking behaviors. My
preliminary data suggest that broad optogenetic activation of PVTàNAc neurons reduces alcohol-seeking,
evidenced by decreased active lever presses and alcohol deliveries during an operant head-fixed task in
nondependent mice. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of PVTàNAc neurons releases this “brake” and
promotes active lever pressing, even in the face of behavioral suppressors. Importantly, after inducing alcohol
dependence via chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, presentation of behavioral suppressors, including
direct activation of PVTàNAc neurons, no longer reduces alcohol seeking, indicative of a functional uncoupling
of this circuit leading to behavioral disinhibition. These current data suggest that PVTàNAc neurons may serve
as an exciting new target for studying how chronic alcohol induces disinhibition at the level of neuronal ensemble
activity. To date, no work has explored single-cell manipulation or two-photon calcium imaging of PVTàNAc
neuronal ensembles in regulating alcohol seeking before and after alcohol dependence. The focus of this
proposal therefore, is to identify and manipulate specific PVTàNAc neuronal ensembles that may be altered
after dependence. My overarching hypothesis is that inhibitory neuronal ensemble activity in PVTàNAc will best
decode alcohol-seeking behaviors and become persistently inactivated following ethanol dependence reducing
feedforward inhibition onto PV-INs. Aim 1 will measure calcium dynamics of PVTàNAc neurons in vivo to identify
unique neuronal ensembles that emerge during alcohol seeking. I will then manipulate specific PVTàNAc
neurons that may be altered before and after alcohol dependence. Aim 2 will assess how inputs from PVT onto
parvalbumin neurons in the nucleus accumbens may be altered following dependence ex vivo. Collectively, this
research will provide valuable and novel information on the role of thalamo-striatal ensembles to enhance our
understanding of underlying mechanisms of disinhibition in AUD."
11058766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress is associated with insufficient sleep and poor quality sleep. In particular, fragmented non-rapid eye
movement sleep (NREMs) due to frequent brief arousals (microarousals, MAs) disrupts sleep continuity, and
rapid eye movement sleep (REMs) abnormalities are often observed in patients with insomnia and depression.
Insufficient sleep and alterations in sleep microarchitecture caused by stress may in turn worsen the stress
symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, and have been shown to increase the risk of developing psychiatric
disorders. Nevertheless, the identity of the involved stress- and sleep-regulatory circuits, and the mechanisms
by which stress perturbs distinct features of the sleep architecture and negatively impacts cognitive behaviors
are still largely unclear. We have recently shown that acute psychosocial stress in mice decreases the amount
of sleep and disrupts sleep quality by causing frequent MAs and suppressing REMs. We propose that the
stress-induced decrease in the amount of sleep and changes in sleep microarchitecture are mediated by
different circuit mechanisms. The preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), a crucial center regulating macro-
and microarchitecture of sleep and wakefulness, is densely innervated by stress-regulatory noradrenergic
neurons in the locus coeruleus (NELC) and corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular
nucleus (CRHPVN). The goal of this proposal is to investigate to what extent the NELC and CRHPVN neurons
cause stress-induced sleep disturbances and memory impairment via projections to distinct POA
subpopulations. Our central hypothesis is that stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation are mediated by
inputs from NELC neurons to the POA (NELC→POA), while the overall decrease in sleep is mediated by inputs
from CRHPVN neurons (CRHPVN→POA) and that reversing sleep disturbances attenuates stress-induced memory
deficits. Aim 1 will determine the role of NELC→POA projections in stress-induced MAs and REMs dysregulation
as well as related memory deficits. Aim 2 will determine the role of CRHPVN→POA projections in stress-induced
wakefulness and related memory deficits. Accomplishing these aims will provide important insights into the
neural basis of stress-induced sleep disturbances and the benefits of good quality and quantity sleep in
reversing stress symptoms, with potential relevance to understand and develop novel therapeutic interventions
for stress-related sleep disorders."

Disparities in lung disease and other chronic conditions between poor, mostly Black residents of public housing
communities and the general population are profound, leading to an extraordinary human and economic
burden. Rooted in structural inequalities, these disparities are exacerbated by the conditions of daily life,
including housing and neighborhood physical (built) and social environment. Together, adverse housing and
neighborhood conditions increase disease risk through multiple pathways, including behavioral and biological.
Despite compelling evidence of the health effects of neighborhoods, few interventions have examined the
extent to which specific modifications of housing and neighborhood conditions improve health outcomes. The
proposed study, Housing, Environment, And Living Conditions for Transformed Health (HEALTHe
Birmingham), aims to fill this research gap. Taking advantage of a major investment by federal and local
government, businesses, and organizations, we will evaluate, in a natural experiment, the health effects of a
comprehensive intervention that addresses multiple social determinants of health (SDoH): public housing
quality and features of the neighborhood built and social environments (Aim 1). Recognizing that major
community revitalization efforts are not always possible, to generate solutions that are potentially more feasible
and have wider reach, we also will conduct a prospective trial to determine whether less-expensive
improvements, such as indoor air purification, can positively impact lung health in public housing sites not
undergoing housing renovation, comparing a site exposed to industrial pollution vs one less contaminated
(Aim 2). To bolster the public health and policy implications of this research, we will conduct cost-effectiveness
analyses from economic and societal perspectives and use implementation science to prioritize intervention
strategies, recommend scale-up efforts across communities and contexts, and inform policy on federal and
local levels. We also will assess the extent to which specific components impact health equity between
intervention and control communities (Aim 3). Study findings will facilitate translation of SDoH interventions
into practice, inform public policy across locations and contexts, and contribute to the evidence base of
reducing health inequity through action on SDoH."

individualized preventive interventions are not routinely offered at present due to lack of routine screening
practices and limited resources. Machine learning offers an opportunity to improve mental health services
during the perinatal period by identifying patients who would benefit from specific preventative
interventions. We will develop fundamental advances in ML techniques for the discovery of personalized
interventions as well as advances in the social science of incorporating domain and lived experience into
algorithmic systems. Our specific aims bridge prediction with the adaptive experimentation needed to
identify personalized interventions. In Aim 1, we will develop methods which use existing historical data to
lay the groundwork for a randomized experiment of interventions, including to robustly inform which
variables to measure and how to set an initial allocation policy based on those variables. In Aim 2, we will
elicit domain expertise from clinicians and lived experience expertise from perinatal individuals via semistructured
interviews which will inform both the requirements for a trustworthy and implementable ML
system and a structured representation of clinical expertise that can be incorporated to initialize a ML policy
together with historical data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will synthesize these products into an integrated
framework for online learning to discover personalized preventative interventions. The key component of
this framework is continued interaction with patients to provide intermediate feedback and accelerate
convergence to a high-quality policy for allocating preventative interventions."

Aligning with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science, the research team at Northern Arizona University (NAU),
a funded Research Centers in Minority Institution, proposes to increase and sustainably support data science
capacity and infrastructure at the University level. Through the first seven years of the Southwest Health Equity
Research Collaborative [(SHERC),
NIH U54MD012388], a strong foundation for health-equity research,
contributing to NAU’s expected R1 designation in 2025, has been built. However, NAU and SHERC still lack a
focus on data science. SHERC has successfully supported faculty in the use of the All of Us dataset along with
the
Science and Technology Research Infrastructure for Discovery, Experimentation, and Sustainability
initiative. The Science Collaborative for Health Disparities and Artificial Intelligence Bias Reduction (ScHARe)
data platform has yet to be implemented at NAU. To further bolster the data science infrastructure at NAU, this
project aims to 1) increase the data science capacity of NAU, ultimately expanding the institutional workforce,
and 2) increase utilization of Big Data by health equity investigators through enhanced data science curricula,
mentored training, and educational opportunities. SHERC will meet these objectives by hiring a data scientist,
creating a Data Science Skills Workshop series that includes skills and knowledge needed to use the ScHARe
platform, and mentoring doctoral and undergraduate students using the All of Us dataset."

11059817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deficits in effortful control (EC; top-down control of self-regulation involving inhibitory control and executive
attention) represent a major transdiagnostic risk factor for multiple psychiatric disorders in childhood.
Dysfunctional parenting is a strong predictor of impaired EC, making it a potent target for intervention.
Dysfunctional parenting includes behavioral deficits in parenting sensitivity [timely and appropriate responses to
changes in infant physical and emotional needs], along with cognitive deficits in maternal mind-mindedness
[MMM; attunement to infant mental states that govern goal-directed behavior]. MMM may underlie parenting
sensitivity, but prospective links remain unclear. MMM facilitates the transition from external caregiver-based
regulation to self-regulation in early childhood by providing the foundation for intentional mental-state talk to
regulate behavior. While adverse caregiving exposures have profound effects on brain structure, the extent that
MMM impacts infant brain structural and functional connectivity in key brain regions underlying EC during periods
of brain plasticity is unknown. This innovative proposal offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this
scientific question with training at an institution rich with expertise in child psychiatry and neuroscience research.
This K01 will chart the development of EC and related brain networks by leveraging a valuable captured infant
cohort undergoing repeated diffusion (dMRI) and resting state functional (rsfMRI) MRI scans and developmental
evaluations from birth to age 3 years. The applicant will add to the existing study a prospective observational
assessment of MMM, a standardized test of infant executive attention, and examine connectivity in a unique set
of white matter tracts. As the cohort is enriched for poverty, this study will examine novel links between maternal
perinatal psychosocial risk (poverty, depression, anxiety, stress) and later MMM and parenting sensitivity, and
the extent that that psychosocial risk indirectly influences EC via causally linked multiple mediators of MMM and
infant brain connectivity. Findings will elucidate MMM as a modifiable factor that may increase parent sensitivity
to enhance infant brain connectivity and EC to reduce psychopathology. [If MMM alters infant brain connectivity,
findings will underscore infancy as a critical time for targeted preventative intervention before EC deficits emerge
and lead to psychopathology; identify vulnerable infants who may benefit the most from intervention; and inform
the design of novel MMM interventions to enhance infant brain function in networks most sensitive to parenting
inputs and most related to EC.] This award will build upon the applicant’s foundation in child development, school-
age executive attention, and structural MRI by providing [new and more advanced training in the assessment of
mother-infant interactions, the development of EC in infancy, and dMRI and rsfMRI methods.] The applicant will
gain the skills needed to conduct longitudinal research on the caregiving and neurobiological mechanisms of
child psychopathology. This K01 will facilitate an R01 proposal that will modify MMM in a parent-child intervention
to alter risk trajectories linking poverty with aberrant brain connectivity and psychopathology into school-age."
11075939,"People living with HIV infection (PLWH) are living longer but with advancing age experience
accelerated functional decline (decreased strength, slowed gait, reduced exercise tolerance) and increased
frailty, as compared to non-infected individuals. The syndromes of functional decline and frailty are associated
with impaired quality of life, increased vulnerability to superimposed stresses, and the likelihood of premature
morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this accelerated dysfunction and disability, however, are
poorly understood. The proposed project examines the contribution of altered skeletal muscle (SM)
mitochondrial function and high energy phosphate metabolism to the related, but distinct syndromes of fatigue,
exercise intolerance, and frailty often present in older PLWH. Considerable pre-clinical data and our pilot
clinical studies using a 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) fatigability test during and following lower-
extremity exercise suggest an “energetic myopathy” as a possible basis for the fatigue and decreased
performance in older PLWH individuals. However the extent, underlying responsible factors, and functional
significance of altered SM mitochondrial bioenergetics in this population have not been characterized. In
addition, two potential mechanisms responsible for altered SM high energy phosphate metabolism in other
populations, increased inflammation and SM lipid accumulation, have not been examined and related to
muscle energetics in PLWH and so these too will be examined. The central hypothesis is that impaired SM
mitochondrial energy metabolism, initiated by aging and accelerated in the setting of contemporary HIV, is a
central contributor to the geriatric syndromes of fatigue, exercise intolerance, and frailty in older PLWH. We
propose to use state-of-the art 31P MRS exercise testing, detailed muscle and whole body composition
measures, functional assessments during observed and free-living conditions, and biomarkers of inflammation
and immune activation in 200 older (age>=60) women and men derived from four local NIH-sponsored cohorts
to address these questions. The specific aims are 1) to define the scope of SM metabolic changes in older
women and men living with HIV, 2) to probe whether inflammation, skeletal fat and other underlying factors are
related to the energetic abnormalities in older PLWH and 3) to determine the functional significance of SM
energetic changes in older PLWH by examining the relationships between the energetic changes and exercise
tolerance and other functional assessments as well as the frailty phenotype. Fatigue, exercise intolerance, and
frailty are common in older PLWH and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood These novel,
timely studies will provide new insights and guide future intervention strategies designed to attenuate or
reverse mitochondrial and bioenergetic decline and thereby reduce the personal and societal toll of these
geriatric conditions in older women and men living with HIV."

The specific aim of this proposal is to obtain partial funding for the expenses (travel and lodging) for junior
investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students from the USA to attend the 11th International Meeting
on Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. The meeting will be held November 12-15, 2024 at The Allen Institute for
Cell Science in Seattle, WA, USA under the auspices of The Allen Institute for Cell Science and the Epithelial-
Mesenchymal Transition International Association (TEMTIA).
The objectives of the meeting are to 1. Bring together investigators in the separate disciplines of cancer,
pathology and development to discuss their observations on EMT and explore whether there is a consensus on
important components of the process. 2. Provide a forum where students and junior investigators can interact
with senior investigators and display their own work and ideas in the field. 3. Expand a viable co-operative cross
disciplinary forum of EMT-related researchers internationally. This will continue to provide a worldwide network
for exchange of expertise, reagents and techniques across disciplines. 4. Publish a timely meeting update on
cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of EMT in an appropriate cross-disciplinary international journal.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process undertaken by cells in the embryo to
form 3-dimensional structures from sheets of cells. During EMT, epithelial cells lose adherence to adjacent cells,
degrade the local basement membrane and invade the underlying interstitial extracellular matrix. At the cellular
level, this process requires specific signal transduction elements, new gene transcription, reorganization of the
cytoskeleton, secretion of extracellular matrix molecules and growth factors. In the embryo, this process is
reiterated at gastrulation, neural crest cell formation, somite breakdown, pancreatic islet formation, heart valve
formation brain organization and in several other areas of organogenesis. In the adult, EMT occurs as a
component of wound healing and in the pathologies of cancer metastasis and tissue fibrosis."
11074372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) B-ALL could potentially benefit from the efficacy of CD19 CAR-T
therapy, however they are particularly susceptible to lineage switching (to acute myelogenous leukemia, AML)
upon CD19-directed therapies. However, defining the precise origins and mechanistic basis of “lineage-
switched” leukemia has proven difficult. Clinical studies have previously relied on bulk tumor analysis of
biospecimens obtained pre- and post-CAR-T therapy to infer lineage switching has occurred based on the
presence of naturally occurring genetic footprints (e.g., specific immunoglobulin rearrangements or
translocation breakpoints) in relapsed myeloid CD19neg blasts as evidence of a B-lineage CD19+ origin. These
approaches fail to uncover the clone-specific mechanisms that favor lineage switching throughout CAR-T
pressure directed at the CD19 surface protein. With our newly developed system to transform B cell
progenitors to B-ALL with KMT2A-fusion oncoproteins, we have developed a system that captures the inherent
plasticity of KMT2A-r leukemia. This supplement proposal will rigorously identify leukemia-intrinsic lineage
reprogramming mechanisms though a cellular barcoding and tracking approach that will enable prospective
identification of cell populations that are prone to become the lineage-switched AML in vivo. These studies will
lead to a better understanding of lineage plasticity and the extent to which epigenetic heterogeneity contributes
to the relapsed AML, which can directly inform the design of curative therapies."
11058767,"Increasing evidence indicates that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is manifests differently in males and females
behaviorally and affects brain function and connectivity differently between sexes. There has been little known
of how ASD genes affect the female brain on a cellular and microcircuit level. During the previous grant period
we discovered that deletion of the ASD-risk gene, Pten (Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on
chromosome 10), in neocortical pyramidal neurons (NSEPten KO) resulted in robust hyperexcitability of local
neocortical circuits in female, but not male, mice, observed as prolonged, spontaneous persistent activity states
(UP states). We also demonstrated that circuit hyperexcitability in NSEPten KO mice is mediated by enhanced
signaling of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) to ERK and de novo
protein synthesis selectively in Pten deleted female neurons. Pten deleted Layer 5 cortical neurons have a
female-specific increase in mGluR5 levels and mGluR5-driven protein synthesis. In addition, mGluR5-ERα
complexes are elevated in female cortex and genetic reduction of ERα in Pten KO cortical neurons rescues
circuit excitability, protein synthesis and enhanced neuron size selectively in females. Abnormal timing and
hyperexcitability of neocortical circuits in female NSEPten KO mice are associated with deficits in temporal
processing of sensory stimuli and social behaviors as well as mGluR5-dependent seizures. Female-specific
cortical hyperexcitability and mGluR5-dependent seizures are also observed in a human disease relevant mouse
model, germline Pten+/- mice. Our results demonstrate sex-specific dysfunction of developing cortical circuits
with loss of function of a high-confidence ASD-risk gene. Importantly, we demonstrate a distinct, female-specific
dysfunction of mGluR5- ERα signaling pathways that drive excitability. For the Phase 2 extension of this work,
we propose to determine the female-specific, Pten-regulated cellular and molecular alterations in cortical
neurons that give rise to hyperexcitability of circuits. In Aim 1, we will determine the sex-specific, mGluR5 and
ERα -regulated neuronal and synaptic properties in L5 PTEN KO neurons. In Aim 2 we will determine the sex-
specific, PTEN-regulated ribosome- associated transcripts in L5 cortical neurons and their regulation by mGluR5
and ERα. Our results reveal sex-specific and estrus cycle-dependent deficits in sensory-processing in Pten loss
of function models. In Aim 3 we will determine if a reduction in mGluR5 or ERα function corrects these sensory
processing deficits and in Aim 4, we will examine the role of estrogen and estrus cycle in dysfunction of
developing and mature cortical circuits and in vivo resting and sensory-driven EEG phenotypes in Pten loss of
function models. Results of these aims are expected to provide knowledge of the sex-specific mechanisms by
which ASD-risk genes regulate the development and function of sensory cortical circuits and affect sensory
processing."

Following injury and repair, tendons rarely exhibit full restoration of function and reinjuries are prominent. Poor
clinical outcomes are due to deposition of disorganized scar tissue rather than tissue with the anisotropic,
hierarchical structure as in uninjured tendon. Prior work has demonstrated that anisotropic materials as
scaffolds to guide cells promote expression of tenogenic markers and provide a template for cell orientation,
showing promise for promoting regenerative healing. However, biomaterials used in these studies lack
tunability in biophysical and biochemical cues critical for fully recapitulating the native tendon environment in
an engineered extracellular matrix (eECM) and translation of the eECM to in vivo applications. To address
these limitations, we have developed a novel approach to fabricate anisotropic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
hydrogel-based eECM to promote the alignment of human tenocytes. These anisotropic hydrogels are formed
using a two-stage polymerization that eliminates complications of using additives or complex processing
techniques to introduce anisotropy and enables scaling of the biomaterial without compromising material
properties. In the first stage, a network is formed via a Michael-addition reaction of 4-arm PEG-maleimide and
dicysteine peptides. The network is strained to introduce anisotropy, followed by a secondary thiol-ene
photocrosslinking of remaining peptide thiols and 8-arm PEG-norbornene to retain strain-induced alignment.
Notably, the eECM includes MMP-degradable crosslinks to balance structural cues and matrix remodeling. We
propose herein that hydrogel-mediated anisotropic guidance and biochemical cues to tenocytes in balance with
hydrogel remodeling will orchestrate native-like tendon deposition. In Aim 1, material properties of anisotropic
eECM will be characterized. Mechanical properties will be tested via tensile testing parallel and perpendicular
to alignment. Temporal retention of alignment as a function of MMP-mediated degradation will be analyzed via
wide angle x-ray diffraction. Human tenocytes will be seeded in the eECM and cell and matrix anisotropy will
be analyzed using microscopy. Matrix deposition will be analyzed by comparing ratios and organization of type
I to type III collagen deposition and gene expression of scleraxis, tenomodulin, mohawk, and ⍺SMA as
measures of regenerative versus fibrotic characteristics. Isotropic hydrogels will be used as controls with
analysis over 14 days in vitro. In Aim 2, tenocyte gene expression profiles induced by anisotropic, degradable
PEG hydrogel-based eECM will be comprehensively analyzed via RNAseq. Differential gene expression will be
assessed on day 14 samples to compare gene profiles between eECM groups and freshly isolated cells from
healthy and fibrotic tendons. Completing these aims will provide insight into materials design parameters for
eECM to develop a pro-regenerative environment for tenocytes. The hydrogels are expected to promote
alignment and suppress fibrosis, providing a platform for translating eECM as an effective 3D scaffold in
tendon repair and other aligned musculoskeletal tissues such as muscle."
11057869,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asian Americans (AAs) are the fastest growing racial group in the US and are comprised of over 40 diverse
cultural groups. Although the prevalence of smoking across AA populations is about half of the national
average, disaggregated data reveals a different picture: males of Vietnamese (24.4%), Korean (19.3%), and
Filipino Americans (20.6%) report high smoking prevalence, up to two times higher than other Asian ethnic
subgroups such as Chinese or Asian Indian males. Such substantial disparity requires new approaches.
Health communication is an effective way to enhance population health outcomes, including tobacco use.
Targeted health communication, developing messages that reflect unique characteristics of a particular
subpopulation, can be a key strategy to address tobacco-related health disparity among AA smokers. The
proposed research aims to assess the effectiveness of targeting strategies informed by cultural sensitivity
theory: deep (e.g., content reflecting Asian cultural values) and surface structure (e.g., featuring Asian models)
targeting in anti-smoking messages. The long-term goal of this research program is to inform effective and
efficient intervention development to enhance public health outcomes and promote health equity among
culturally diverse groups, including Asian Americans and Latinx populations. The objective will be addressed in
two aims: (1) Examine the acceptability of culturally targeted anti-smoking messages among Korean,
Vietnamese, and Filipino American smokers using in-depth interviews; (2) assess the effectiveness of surface
and deep structure targeting strategies among Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino American smokers using an
experiment. The proposed research will use four types of anti-smoking messages: a) deep and surface
structure targeted; b) deep structure only targeted; c) surface structure only targeted; and d) non-targeted
messages. Study 1 will use in-depth interviews to examine how AA smokers respond to messages with
different targeting strategies. Study 2 will use 2X2 between-subject online experiment to assess the
effectiveness of deep and surface-structure targeting strategies by observing how outcome variables differ
across the conditions. We will examine the main and interaction effects of the two targeting strategies, as well
as their relative effectiveness. The proposed research is innovative because this is one of the first studies to
apply analytical approach based on message effects theories to systematically manipulate specific message
components to assess the effects of various targeting strategies for AAs, including their relative effectiveness.
Also, this study is the first to evaluate message effects using a volumetric choice experiment that estimates
individual-level price elasticity and cigarette demand, in addition to other self-reported measurements."

Well-Child visits (WCV) are an opportunity to maximize the health, development, and future well-being of
children. Scheduled but not attended (“no-showed”) visits can lead to negative health and economic
consequences for patients and families (delayed preventive care including screening and immunizations, and
avoidable ED visits and hospitalizations) and for the healthcare system (decreased efficiency and productivity,
lower quality measures, productivity, and revenue loss). Though adherence to the WCV schedule has
improved for the U.S. population over time, disparities persist. Children who are less adherent to the
recommended WCV schedule are more often to be identified as Black or African American, as Hispanic or
Latino, or are uninsured or publicly-insured. There is a need to identify high impact, cost-effective approaches
to engage families who have missed WCV, especially among minority and low-income populations.
Health systems increasingly utilize technology such as text messaging or personnel such as community health
workers (CHWs) to interact with patients or caregivers, and both approaches indicate positive effects. Indeed,
pilot work from this research team comparing text message follow-up only to usual care suggested that
sending text messages contributed to greater completion of a WCV within six weeks of no-show for some
families, but that there is a need to look at patterns over a full year to eliminate seasonal variation. CHWs are
most typically engaged following provider referral, hospitalization, or recurring ED utilization, and so there is a
need to explore deploying CHW resources in a more preventative manner through outreach following a missed
visit. No-shows may reflect barriers to care that include social drivers of health, which CHWs are well-
positioned to address, and through a relational approach CHWs may help promote ongoing engagement in
preventive care for families. Moreover, economic evaluation of technological and relational follow-up combined
with trial data about which strategy(ies) works for whom can help inform resource allocation.
The aims of this exploratory study are to: (1) demonstrate feasibility of merging a new referral protocol into
existing resources for CHW outreach following WCV no-show; (2) compare WCV attendance following no-
show between families who receive care-as-usual, text message (low-touch), and CHW outreach (high-touch)
interventions, using a year-long randomized controlled trial; and (3) define costs and cost-effectiveness of
using a low-touch or high-touch intervention to improve WCV attendance compared to care-as-usual. The
study will reach a demographically diverse, urban population, in English and Spanish.
Findings from the proposed study will help inform a future, larger scale trial that expands into rural areas and
other health system markets, tests tailored strategies for no-show follow-up, and incorporates advanced
economic simulation methods to consider implications of applying such strategies to even larger populations,
all with the long-term goal of reducing disparities in pediatric preventive care."
11060758,"Accurate diagnosis of cancer hinges on histopathological assessment, with treatment pivoting upon the
tumor's morphological classification. AI models, especially deep learning (DL) models, have shown great
promise in accurately classifying tumors from histopathological images (often with additional genomic
information). Unlike typical medical images featuring small critical areas, histopathological images are
textural, with relevant texture spanning the entire image, making it challenging to explain DL prediction by
locating areas of an image. Such lack of explainability (and interpretability) severely limits DL's potential as a
valuable tool to pathologists. Thus, there is a critical need to systematically explain DL histopathological
models, beyond mere localization, to substantially improve AI-assisted cancer diagnosis for pathologists.
 This project aims to develop a principled framework to systematically explain DL histopathological
models using counterfactual explanations. The rationale is that while texture features are not amenable to
localization-based explanation methods, one can explain the model by asking counterfactual questions such
as “what histopathological image could have shifted the model prediction from non-aggressive tumor to
aggressive tumor”. Specifically, this project centers around four tasks: (1) Dataset-Level Generative
Explanation: Developing a dataset-level “generative explainer” framework to explain any given DL
histopathological model by generating a spectrum of histopathological images that can lead to an associated
spectrum of different predictions (e.g., from “non-aggressive” through “aggressive” to “highly aggressive”) of
the explained DL model. (2) Instance-Level Counterfactual Explanation: Developing a principled
instance-level “counterfactual explainer” framework to generate instance-specific counterfactual
explanations for a specific histopathological image. (3) Fast Counterfactual Explanation: Developing a
“fast counterfactual explainer” framework to enable real-time generation of counterfactual histopathological
images. (4) From Explanation to Subtype Discovery: Developing a “subtyping counterfactual explainer”
framework that goes beyond explanation to discover novel cancer subtypes (or phenotypes).
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Accurate diagnosis of cancer hinges on histopathological assessment, with treatment pivoting upon the
tumor's morphological classification. AI models can often accurately classify tumors from histopathological
images, but their lack of interpretability severely hinders their deployment in clinical scenarios. This project
develops a principled framework to systematically explain AI histopathological models using counterfactual
explanations, thereby substantially improving AI-assisted cancer diagnosis for pathologists."

Project Summary/Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global public health concern affecting millions of individuals in the United States [1], with
more than 13 million reporting extended symptoms and disability following a TBI [2]. The costs of acute healthcare related
to TBI exceed $10 billion and over $75 billion when including extended indirect costs and loss of productivity [3]. TBI is
disproportionately represented among incarcerated samples, with incidence rates approximately ten times higher than in the
general population [4, 5]. TBI also presents as a criminogenic risk factor with sequelae that include emotional liabilities,
disinhibition, and substance abuse [6-11]. Our team has conducted neuroscience research and treatment studies among
forensic populations for over 20 years, examining mental health, addiction, personality disorders, and other forensic issues.
The parent grant (R01 NS126742) for this administrative supplement (NOT-OD-24-031) focuses on the consequences of
head injury and protracted cognitive and neural deficits in forensic populations. As we describe here, the analytic strategies
involved in this project employ advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to predict TBI
and its associated cognitive decline trajectory, which raises major bioethical questions. To directly address NINDS proposed
targets, and to supplement the aims of our parent R01, we will conduct bioethical research, stakeholder analysis, and
empirical work concerning diagnostic neurobiological research utilizing AI/ML for TBI, the return of results to research
participants, risk of re-identification, and the conduction of clinical trials in forensic populations. Overall, the important
work of integrating vulnerable stakeholder viewpoints into bioethical inquiry holds the potential to impact future bioethical
related policy directions as requested in NOT-OD-24-031."
11063656,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Long-acting injectable (LAI) suspensions represent a class of complex drug products administered
either intramuscularly or subcutaneously and characterized by depot formation that results in prolonged
release profiles. Despite their therapeutic potential, LAI suspensions are relatively underdeveloped,
partly due to the limited understanding of the complex interplay between the formulation and the
physiological response at the depot site. Furthermore, there is an absence of generic versions for many
commercial LAI suspensions, despite expiration of patents and exclusivity rights. This can be explained
by the limited understanding of how critical formulation attributes (CQAs) affect the in vivo behavior of
LAI suspensions. Challenges in conducting bioequivalence (BE) studies and the absence of robust in
vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) are additional burdens to LAI generic development. Accordingly,
additional research is needed to enhance the understanding of interactions between formulation CQAs
and the physiological response at the depot site, to develop in silico mechanistic IVIVCs.
 To address these challenges, this research aims to comprehensively investigate the interplay
between formulation CQAs and physiological factors at the local site to accurately predict in vivo drug
release using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. To achieve this goal, the offerors
plan to: (1) Perform a thorough investigation into the complex relationships among the physicochemical
properties of Q1Q2 equivalent formulations of Depo Provera 150® and their impact on in vitro release.
(2) Understand how the physicochemical properties of Q1Q2 equivalent formulations of Depo Provera
150® and the local tissue physiology impact in vivo release. (3) Develop model-based mechanistic
IVIVCs for Depo Provera 150® in GastroPlus® considering both the physiological response and the
product morphometrics at the local site. (4) Understand how the complex interplay between formulation
physicochemical properties and physiological properties at the local site impacts in vitro and in vivo
performance of Depo SubQ Provera 104® and refine previously developed preclinical IVIVCs.
 This research represents a significant effort to reveal the intricate relationships between formulation
properties and injection site physiology, providing insight into BE approaches for LAI suspensions. The
in vitro and in vivo data generated will provide a comprehensive understanding of physicochemical and
physiological interactions, allowing development of robust and reliable PBPK model-based mechanistic
IVIVCs for LAIs. This proposal builds on and extends previous investigations by Dr. Burgess’ laboratory
and Simulations Plus, in partnership with the US FDA. Ultimately, this work will establish BE
recommendations thus ensuring the availability of safe and economical generic LAI products, benefiting
public health by providing the American people access to essential medications."
11063705,"There is an immediate need to understand the critical formulation parameters that may affect product
performance in vitro and in vivo, with a goal of developing IVIVCs for long-acting injectables. In this proposal,

pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach. PBPK modeling “provides a unique opportunity to understand how
the physicochemical properties of drug molecules/polymer, implant specific properties, critical formulation
attributes, and physiology, among other things, influence the in vivo release mechanisms of LAI drug products
and their disposition characteristics. Successful execution of the project will entail (1) developing a bio-predictive
in-vitro release testing method and determining how critical formulation and physicochemical properties impact
the in-vitro release of PLGA-based buprenorphine implants; and (2) using a bottom-up PBPK approach to build
IVIVCs that predict in-vivo PK profiles of PLGA-based buprenorphine implants from in-vitro data."

11082067,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart rate is one of the most widely used and informative metrics of health. Yet, the neural circuits which
determine heart rate are only partly known. Over a century of research has shown that heart rate is oppositely
controlled by the two branches of the autonomic nervous system, which increase (sympathetic) or decrease
(parasympathetic) heart rate in response to the body’s changing needs for circulation. Parasympathetic input to
the heart occurs through the vagus nerve, a cranial nerve which carries axons from hindbrain parasympathetic
neurons, known as cardiovagal neurons, to downstream neurons in the cardiac ganglia. A minority of these
neurons reside in a region of the hindbrain called the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) but were
recently found capable of robustly decreasing heart rate. However, the DMV is also home to a variety of other
neurons, which presents significant technical challenges to studying the cardiovagal subset. For instance,
intermingled with the DMV cardiovagal neurons are parasympathetic neurons which mediate digestive,
metabolic, and immune functions. The inability to access the cardiovagal subset has greatly limited what we
know about their synaptic circuitry, gene expression, and specific roles in heart function. Thus, there is much to
learn about the nature of these important neurons, how they function, and how they can be targeted to treat
heart disease. Our preliminary studies identified one molecular subtype of DMV neuron which innervates
cardiac ganglia. Our proposed research will target this subtype to manipulate its activity and reveal its
physiological role and significance. The results will identify DMV neurons which control heart rate and so may
reveal a new therapeutic target for treating heart disease."
11084277,"Abstract
Novelty and surprise have long been known to facilitate learning and memory. At a functional level this makes sense;
unexpected events have to be learned about so they can be predicted and responded to appropriately in the future. At a
psychological level, surprising events have been shown to enhance memory because they induce rehearsal. Subjects tend
to “think about” unexpected events more than familiar ones after they occur. This has been observed directly in humans
(explicit rehearsal) and indirectly in animals (implicit rehearsal). In both cases, the memory enhancement can be
eliminated by disrupting rehearsal with a distractor stimulus that is presented immediately after the novel event.
Presenting the same distractor stimulus several minutes later has no effect. This suggests rehearsal is short-lasting and
distinct from the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes new information for several hours after learning. In
addition to increasing rehearsal, novel events also trigger the release of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), which
are known to enhance synaptic plasticity. Blocking receptors for these neuromodulators in the hippocampus prevents
animals from forming new spatial and contextual memories. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that surprising
events enhance memory because they induce catecholamine release at the same time the hippocampus is actively
rehearsing/replaying new information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that NE and DA are both released in the
hippocampus during and after the presentation of an unexpected aversive stimulus. At the same time, there is an increase
in sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs), which are known to contain replay sequences for recently encountered stimuli.
Consequently, we will test the hypothesis above by monitoring and manipulating catecholamine release in real-time
during an aversive learning task while simultaneously recording oscillations and single unit activity in the hippocampus."

academic institutions throughout the Southeast and local, state, and federal public health agencies, to facilitate
existing and future efforts in vector-borne disease (VBD) surveillance and control and (ii) expanding an effective
academic, online, and internship-based training program in basic public health entomology to augment the cohort
of personnel who are trained with the requisite knowledge and skills to quickly detect and respond to VBDs
across the U.S., and (iii) initiating the drive towards an evidence-based set of recommendations and a tailored
template of a “surveillance-response program” to ensure that local mosquito and vector control associations can
better monitor and control VBDs in the U.S. For the next iteration of the SECVBD, we take advantage of the
biocomplexity of tick- and mosquito-borne diseases in the Southeastern U.S. and Puerto Rico and leverage an
integrated, data-driven, applied research program designed to produce maximal output in novel interventions
and training paradigms within a 5-year period to tackle the following CDC priorities: (a) Laboratory/field
evaluations of emerging technologies to suppress host-seeking ticks or disrupt pathogen transmission cycles;
(b) Field studies aimed at optimizing application of tick control products to provide recommendations for pest
control firms and homeowners regarding how to optimize tick suppression; (c) Assessments of the potential for
incorporating tick management into existing mosquito management programs; (d) Investigations on the
knowledge, attitudes, & behaviors regarding tick control methodologies, (e) Evaluation of the impact of existing
public education programs on TBI risk & behaviors to prevent tick bite; (f) Field evaluations of emerging
technologies to suppress mosquito adults (insecticide resistance); (g) Field evaluations of mosquito management
approaches based on commercially available methods and products (both entomological and human-related
outcome measures); and (h) Evaluations of the effectiveness of operational control activities targeting all
mosquito stages (including insecticide resistance). The goal is to maintain our established, comprehensive,
applied, and basic research program to further our understanding of VBD transmission to prevent VBDs in the
continental U.S. and territories."
11060663,"This application for the Center for Structural Biology of HIV RNA (CRNA) focuses on determining the structural
and mechanistic bases of HIV-1 RNA-related replication functions and the host’s response at the cellular, viral
and atomic levels. Although considerable progress has been made over the past 40 years in understanding
how proteins function in HIV-1 replication, comparatively little is known about how HIV-1 RNA structures,
dynamics, trafficking, and interactions with proteins alternately enable or limit virus replication. The past
decade has provided transformative examples of the therapeutic use of RNA and RNA-targeted therapies.
Because HIV-1 RNA is exceptionally rich in biologic functions, and recent progress by members of the
proposed team has begun to unlock structural and dynamic features of RNA elements in HIV-1, the potential
for RNA-targeted approaches in the prevention, maintenance, and cure of HIV disease is highly compelling.
However, this potential is limited by the general paucity of high-resolution structural information for RNA and
protein-RNA complexes, which reflects inherent challenges in using RNA as a subject for structural analysis
and the inadequacy of traditional biophysical approaches to address these challenges. The CRNA consists of
a multidisciplinary team of structural biologists, chemists, cell and computational biologists, biochemists,
immunologists and virologists. Many are leaders in the study of HIV-1 RNA and the roles of its structures in
virus replication, while others are new to the HIV field and bring a fresh perspective and complementary
expertise. Together, this team brings cutting edge technologies and incisive biologic approaches to overcome
current technological obstacles, enabling mechanistic determination of the role of HIV-1 RNA structures and
associated proteins in viral transcription, splicing, translation, packaging, particle assembly, and interactions
with host factors. These studies will enable the CRNA to advance goals of clinical relevance, including the
development of novel classes of antiviral compounds, design of new strategies for the reactivation of latent
proviruses, and the augmentation of host defenses against HIV infection. These studies will also result in the
development of powerful new techniques that can be applied to all areas of RNA biology."

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, systemic arteriopathy with excess burden on women.
FMD may have varying manifestations, including hypertension, stroke and myocardial infarction, among
others, depending on the arterial beds involved by arterial stenosis, aneurysm, dissection or tortuosity. Arterial
dissections are recognized as a major manifestation and cause of substantial morbidity and mortality risk.
Genetic susceptibility loci for FMD and arterial dissections identified thus far implicate arterial smooth muscle
and its corresponding extracellular matrix. The genetic architecture of these arterial diseases is emerging as
variable, with contributions of a complex genetic architecture, rare heritable variants in a subset of cases, and
potential modifier genes. The proposed studies will build upon the R35 awarded to Dr. Ganesh to support the
training of postdoctoral fellow Cameron Pinnock, PhD and evaluate the genetic and allelic spectrum of
spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and FMD in novel bioengineered cellular and tissue models.
These studies are within scope and fully aligned with the goal of the R35 award as originally stated to precisely
define the genetic basis of arterial fibrodysplasia and employ relevant model systems for gene and variant
mechanistic testing, resolution of genetic variants of uncertain significance, testing influences of potential
modifier genes, and analysis of gene regulatory mechanisms, particularly those relevant to vascular sex
differences and female-biased cardiovascular disease. We will test the hypothesis that the genetic influences
on FMD and SCAD alter the vascular smooth muscle matricellular unit in manners that render the artery
susceptible to loss of tissue integrity. The expected outcome of the proposed studies will be the successful
integration of genomics and functional studies with new engineered models that provide new insights into the
mechanisms of arterial dysplasia."
11059627,"ABSTRACT
Intimate partner violence (IPV) during the perinatal period is a pervasive and devastating public health epidemic.
IPV also intersects with structural and institutional violence, particularly for Black, Latine, low income, and sexual
and gender diverse (SGD) people, who report experiencing systems-level violence during the perinatal period.
Healthcare settings offer a unique opportunity to support perinatal IPV survivors and connect them with
community-based resources, as they come for regularly scheduled prenatal and postpartum visits. Universal
empowerment is a promising healthcare-based IPV intervention, where IPV related education and resources are
provided to all perinatal patients, avoiding some of the challenges of the traditional screen and refer approach.
Universal empowerment has been tested and shown to be effective and feasible in other settings such as family
planning clinics and school-based health centers, but has not been rigorously evaluated during prenatal visits.
Universal empowerment may be further optimized by doula-based support for IPV survivors, as doulas have
been shown to improve other health outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, access to perinatal visits) although less is
known about their effect on reducing IPV. Doulas may be particularly effective in buffering perinatal people from
discrimination and bias experienced in healthcare and social services systems, which is critical for IPV survivors
with marginalized or multiply marginalized identities who experience both IPV and structural violence. In
response to RFA-NR-23-004, the objective of this application is to conduct a 2-arm type 1 hybrid trial with 250
perinatal people (125 per group) to test the effectiveness of an enhanced universal empowerment intervention
delivered during 28–32 week prenatal visits (Thrive) compared with universal empowerment plus pairing with an
IPV-trained doula (Doula Thrive). In Aim 1, we will assess the effectiveness of both Thrive and Doula Thrive in
reducing IPV (primary outcome; defined as a range of coercive and controlling behaviors), as well as perinatal
cannabis use, tobacco use, and depression (secondary outcomes). We hypothesize that while both interventions
will reduce IPV, we will find a greater effect for Doula Thrive. In Aim 2, we will conduct mediation and moderation
analyses to test mechanisms through which the intervention is effective and to elucidate survivor profiles
moderating intervention effectiveness. Through interviews, surveys, and tracking data, in Aim 3 we will collect
data on implementation factors aligned with the PRISM framework. We have convened a community-academic
team with expertise in IPV, perinatal disparities, doula care, community-partnered research, clinical trial design
and analysis, and implementation science; IPV survivors will be core partners in this work. Results will inform
the design of a future implementation trial to test further implementation, dissemination, and sustainability. This
intervention has the potential to be transformative in supporting perinatal IPV survivors through community-clinic
linkages, ultimately reducing IPV-related disparities and promoting health equity."
11061184,"This proposed project has direct relevance to Veteran healthcare because it addresses current VA’s research
priority on how HIV-1 infection causes brain damages that affect Veteran’s mental health including HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and suicide. There are about 37 million people currently living with
HIV/AIDS worldwide. Successful treatment with combinational antiretroviral therapies (cART) can eliminate
active replicating viruses and prolong patients’ lives to nearly normal lifespans. However, the new challenge
faced by more than half of those HIV-infected and aging patients is the chronic CNS neuroinflammation, which
leads to various HAND. While severe and progressive HAND has decreased significantly due to cART, chronic
HANDS often persists, resulting in high rates of delirium, dementia and depression that could lead to suicide.
Indeed, “the risk of suicide mortality in HIV-infected persons is 3-5 times higher than in HIV-uninfected
counterparts”. Nevertheless, the mechanism of neuropathogenesis underlying HAND is not well understood.
HAND is typically characterized by HIV-mediated glial neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Interestingly, the
severity of some HAND does not always directly correlate with the levels of HIV, but rather with glial activation,
suggesting other HIV-associated factors, not the whole virus per se, contribute to those HAND. HIV-1 viral protein
R (Vpr) might be one of those viral factors, because Vpr induces neuroinflammation and causes neuronal
apoptosis. Moreover, in the absence of active viral replication under cART, Vpr can be found in CNS-associated
cells because 1) it can be released directly from viral particles; 2) it crosses the blood-brain barrier that can be
taken up by glia and neurons; and 3) it triggers viral transcription of latently-infected cells by binding to LTR
promoter. Despite these strong evidences indicating a prominent role of Vpr in HAND, how exactly Vpr
contributes to HAND remains elusive. The objective of this proposal is to study the specific role(s) of Vpr in
activation of host neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and viral reactivation, as well as its contribution to HAND.
 Through our pilot studies, we discovered correlations between HIV expression and activation of
proinflammatory markers (TLR4, TNFα, NF-κB and the Sur1-Trpm4 channel) in astrocytes of HIV-infected
postmortem human and transgenic mouse brain tissues. Furthermore, Vpr alone activate the same set of
markers in glial cells. The connection between Vpr and the Sur1-Trpm4 channel could potentially be significant
for understanding HAND because this channel is a key neuro-regulator involved in various neurocognitive brain
conditions. Indeed, inhibition of the channel by a repurposed and FDA-approved drug glibenclamide reduces
Vpr-induced apoptosis and improves other neuroinflammatory brain conditions. Thus, our pilot studies may have
revealed a novel mechanism of HAND involving Vpr-induced activation of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel. Therefore,
we hypothesize that Vpr contributes to HAND by TLR4/MyD88- and/or TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation, which
in turn upregulate the Sur1-Trpm4 channel leading to neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Alternatively, Vpr-
induced HAND is contributed collectively by NF-κB and Sur1-Trpm4-mediated neuropathologic effects. We
further hypothesize that target-specific inhibition of key regulators such as the Sur1-Trpm4 channel mitigates
Vpr-induced HAND. We will test these hypotheses with three specific aims (SA). SA1: delineate molecular
mechanism of Vpr-induced neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity and viral reactivation in primary astrocytes; SA2:
test the functional link of Vpr with the Sur1-Trpm4 channel, its interaction with NF-kB and its contribution to Vpr-
induced HAND; and SA3: evaluate the effects of genetic and pharmacologic inhibitions of the Sur1-Trpm4
channel on Vpr-induced HAND by using knock-out mice and by target-specific therapeutic drugs such as
glibenclamide. Successful completion of this project will provide novel insights into 1) the molecular mechanism
and contribution of HIV-1 Vpr to HAND, 2) the functional link between Vpr and the Sur1-Trpm4 channel and its
contribution to HAND, and 3) the feasibility of treating Vpr-related HAND with the therapeutic drug glibenclamide."

This proposal details a five-year research training program that will allow Sara Barmettler, MD to achieve her
goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher focused on improving outcomes among patients with
primary and secondary immunodeficiency. Dr. Barmettler is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School
(HMS) and Assistant in Medicine in Allergy-Immunology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) who has
demonstrated academic productivity and a strong commitment to clinical research. Her prior training and
research in immune deficiency and investigating immunologic outcomes in other B-cell targeted therapies
(including the largest cohort to date of rituximab-treated patients), have established the skills and experience
critical for achieving her proposed research aims.
 The research proposal will advance our understanding of immunologic risk factors for infections,
morbidity, mortality, and decreased quality of life after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Aim 1
utilizes a large retrospective cohort of patients to determine the immunologic impact and clinical significance of
hypogammaglobulinemia following CAR T-cell therapy. Regression models and Bayesian network analysis will
be used to define risk factors for development of infections and poor outcomes and to develop a clinical risk
prediction model. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of hypogammaglobulinemia and immunoglobulin replacement
on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life and evaluate cost-effectiveness of early intervention. In accomplishing
these aims, Dr. Barmettler will address critical gaps in our knowledge of immune dysregulation following the use
of CAR T-cell therapy with the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes.
 Dr. Barmettler will perform this work under the mentorship of Professor Carlos Camargo, an
internationally recognized expert in clinical epidemiology with an outstanding track record of mentorship. Dr.
Barmettler has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators with expertise in epidemiology, biostatistics, B-
cell immunology, CAR T-cell therapy, and infectious disease, whose support will contribute to the success of this
project. In the exceptional training environment at MGH and HMS, Dr. Barmettler will complete coursework and
training in advanced biostatistical techniques and epidemiology, leadership, and responsible conduct of research.
 The training and mentoring plans outlined in this Career Development proposal, along with the
outstanding collaborative opportunities and intellectual environment at MGH and HMS, will allow Dr. Barmettler
to achieve the research and educational aims and to, thereby, establish herself as an independent physician-
scientist with expertise in advanced biostatistical techniques and mechanisms of immune deficiency."

Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is a disorder in language learning and use that affects 7% of the
population. Grammatical difficulties are a hallmark characteristic of this disorder during childhood. Long-term
academic and quality of life outcomes are poor. The development of broadly adoptable techniques to
remediate comprehension and production of complex syntax prior to attainment of fluent reading would
increase access to the academic curriculum earlier and improve long-term outcomes of individuals with DLD. It
is unlikely that recast therapy, the current standard of care, is delivered effectively within the constraints of
current service delivery approaches and reimbursement models. Thus, there is a need to either demonstrate
that recasts are a superior intervention method worthy of the effort required for faithful implementation, or to
identify and develop an alternative approach that is feasible for administration to children older than 3 who are
not yet fluent readers. Illustrated syntax stories i.e., specially constructed stories loaded with the target
grammatical form that can be read aloud by a caregiver, could be that more feasible approach. Literacy, while
not universal, is more accessible than recast therapy to a broad range of adults and high rates of input can be
rapidly and consistently provided. This approach has previously been shown to increase the production and
comprehension of passives, reported speech, and conjoined clauses in typical preschoolers and school age
children. Our own preliminary data suggests that illustrated syntax stories could also be effective for children
with DLD. Here, we carry out a randomized controlled trial, enrolling 140 children with DLD between the ages
of 4 and 7 who score below 40% correct on the use of passives and object relative clauses. Children receive
one of four possible treatments (recasts at home, recasts in the lab, syntax stories at home, syntax stories in
the lab) for one grammatical structure for 10 weeks and then outcomes are re-assessed for both the treated
and untreated structures. Comparison of the two different treatment approaches in the lab under dose
controlled conditions informs us as to the mechanism of action for language learning. Specifically in Aim 1, we
contrast interactive, feedback-based learning (recast therapy) with concentrated systematic exposure
(illustrated syntax stories). In Aim 2, we consider the influence of the delivery mechanism on the ultimate dose
delivered when treatment is provided by caregivers. We ask whether there is sufficient difference between the
two delivery methods in terms of the dose provided by caregivers such that it cascades down to affect child
outcomes. Combining outcomes data with quantitative information about the degree of fidelity and adherence
and qualitative information reasons for these behavior patterns (Aim 3) will provide critical information about
the circumstances under which these treatments can be provided effectively. These data will be interpreted
within the Theoretical Domains Framework to better understand barriers and enablers of treatment
implementation and to inform future work to scale-up the most effective approach."
11070609,"Project Summary
People with aphasia struggle to translate their thoughts into language. One potential way to help people with
aphasia is using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode intended speech from brain recordings. Recent
studies have shown that continuous language can be decoded from semantic representations that encode the
meaning of intended speech. However, semantic decoding has only been demonstrated in neurologically
healthy participants, and current approaches do not accommodate the language comprehension impairments
that often accompany language production impairments in aphasia. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
develop BCIs that can improve communication in people with aphasia.
This study has three goals: 1) to adapt existing semantic decoding approaches for people with aphasia, 2) to
develop semantic decoding approaches that do not require any language training data from the person being
decoded, and 3) to involve people with aphasia in the design of BCIs. To accomplish these goals, ten
participants with aphasia and ten neurologically healthy participants will be recruited. Semantic decoders will
be trained on functional MRI (fMRI) responses while participants listen to stories and watch movies. Semantic
decoders will be tested on fMRI responses to perceived speech, perceived movies, and imagined speech.
Collaborative design workshops will be held to assess when and how participants with aphasia envision using
BCIs. These findings will evaluate the potential for using semantic decoding to improve communication in
people with aphasia.
This fellowship will provide the applicant with a unique interdisciplinary training experience, which will include
the development of the necessary skills for a) administering language assessments, b) conducting
neuroimaging experiments in participants with aphasia, and c) collecting and analyzing qualitative feedback
from participants with aphasia. The applicant's sponsors and collaborators will provide mentorship in the areas
of participant recruitment, language assessment, experimental design, functional neuroimaging, and thematic
analysis. Together, these experiences will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career."

An estimated 58 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and are at heightened risk
for severe liver disease, including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although effective directly-
acting antiviral treatment is available, only an HCV vaccine will help prevent infection, associated pathologies,
and effectively reduce global disease burden. Cumulative evidence has shown that both B and T cell immunity
contribute to the control of acute HCV infection. A major challenge is the high variability across the genome
especially in the envelope E1E2 glycoproteins, the natural target of protective antibodies. An E1E2-based
immunogen will need to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to multiple epitopes to overcome the high
antigenic diversity of HCV isolates and be of sufficient titers to achieve protective immunity. Our approach is
supported by our recent data that a secreted form of E1E2 (sE1E2) maintains its native-like properties and can
elicit broader neutralizing antibody responses than the membrane-bound form of E1E2 and secreted E2. Such
efforts as funded by the parent proposal require a significant amount of protein production and the current
equipment in use in support of protein production under this award is obsolete and no longer supported by the

Clinical Research Resource Center (ISCORE-RC) was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 to increase clinical
trials in IDeA states through establishment of a service center to highlight trial opportunities and a clinical

11060590,"The rotator cuff (RC) is the primary dynamic stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint and dysfunction can lead
to abnormal joint kinematics through loss of force couples, deterioration of shoulder function, and ultimately
cartilage degeneration and cuff arthropathy. Full-thickness RC tendon tears are common, occurring in >20% of
the adult population, and when non-operative management fails, surgical repair is often performed. Although
muscle fibrosis and tendon degeneration are important variables that can increase surgical complexity and lead
to lower patient outcome scores, they are difficult to evaluate non-invasively, including with conventional
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US), the two most widely used imaging modalities.
 Recently the novel ultrashort echo time magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) MRI technique has been
developed to assess tendon quality, and preliminary results showed insensitivity to the magic angle effect, a
strong correlation with collagen loss, and the capability to distinguish between tendinopathy groups. However,
the variable presence of fat diminishes the accuracy of the technique when applied to degenerated muscle, for
which several new fat-suppression methods have been proposed. Ultrasound quantification of muscle fat and
fibrosis has also been attempted using routine B-mode images with limited success.
 The goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, validate, and translate novel MRI and US techniques
for comprehensive quantitative evaluation of RC muscle and tendon collagen abnormalities and fibrosis. In the
first technical development aim, novel UTE-MT with various fat-suppression methods will be optimized and
implemented, and the superior version with optimized parameters will be determined. In addition, quantitative
US based on raw radiofrequency data will be implemented and novel tissue-specific scattering models will be
created. The first hypothesis is that novel quantitative UTE-MT with fat-suppression and quantitative US
incorporating tissue-specific models for tendon and muscle can be developed and optimized. In the second aim,
a controlled rat model with unilateral massive RC tendon tear is used to induce muscle and tendon degeneration.
The novel quantitative MRI and US techniques will be validated and compared alongside existing quantitative
techniques. The second hypothesis is that these novel techniques can be implemented longitudinally, are
reproducible, and will better correlate with reference standard histological measurements. The third human
translational aim brings these new techniques to the clinic. Two age- and gender-matched cohorts of patients
will be imaged, including individuals without full-thickness RC tears and individuals with full-thickness RC tears
who will undergo surgical repair with acquisition of small biopsy samples. The third hypothesis is that the novel
quantitative MRI and US techniques can be translated to the clinic for comprehensive, non-invasive assessment
of RC muscle and tendon."
11060611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer cells are the organizers of their surroundings and create a tumor microenvironment (TME) favoring cell
division even when oxygen and nutrients are limiting. An extreme example is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) which establishes a metabolically hostile ecosystem characterized by a hypo-vascular, severely hypoxic,
and nutrient deprived stroma. Clinical trials targeting components of the PDAC stroma have not improved overall
survival in unselected cohorts. Thus, while opportunities for targeting the PDAC TME exist, the development of
anti-stromal therapies will require a better understanding of inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity.
Our labs have studied two features of the PDAC stroma: the vasculature and CAFs. By analyzing multiple human
datasets, and mouse models, we found that a significant portion of human PDACs (~10%) are hyper-vascular.
In murine models, hyper-vascularity is associated with increased sensitivity to angiogenesis inhibitors. In
addition, our preliminary studies have shown that in the more typical hypo-vascular tumors, hypoxia renders
PDAC tumor cells incapable of synthesizing unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs), and therefore critically dependent
upon lipids supplied by neighboring CAFs for their survival. Based on these data, we hypothesize that cancer-
associated micro-vasculature and lipid secreting fibroblasts represent under-exploited, clinically relevant targets
within the PDAC stroma.
Here, we propose an innovative approach to delineate the cellular mechanisms by which tumor cells build and
maintain critical metabolic “supply chains” and how regional differences within tumors influence nutrient
utilization and vascular intravasation. Our proposal addresses both basic and translational questions and utilizes
human tissue resources, implantable and genetically engineered mouse models, platforms to assess stromal
geography and metabolic features, and cancer-on-chip techniques for ex vivo modeling. Our ultimate goal is to
understand and manipulate the major sources from which PDAC cells derive essential nutrients (especially vital
uFAs) – focusing on micro-vessels and fibroblasts.
Aim 1. Determine the causes and consequences of vascular heterogeneity in PDAC
Aim 2. Delineate molecular mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities underlying stromal support of

endocarditis (IE) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite its clinical importance, the underlying virulence
mechanism of Sgg is poorly understood. Recent findings from our lab demonstrated that a type VII secretion
system (T7SS) plays a significant role in Sgg virulence. In preliminary studies to further dissect the activities
mediated by the T7SS, EsxA, a specific T7SS effector, was found to be crucial in influencing colonic epithelial
homeostasis likely by targeting a host cell surface receptor of critical function. The goal of the parent R01
proposal is to further delineate the importance of EsxA in Sgg virulence and to elucidate its mechanism of action
in colonic epithelial cells and animal models.
This supplement proposal will further extend the studies proposed
in the parent R01 to investigating the contribution of EsxA and other T7SSs in host immune responses to Sgg.
Completion of the proposed studies is expected to shed light on the role of T7SS in host immune responses to
Sgg and gain a more comprehensive view of the activities of Sgg T7SS across different host cell types. The
results will further advance our understanding of Sgg virulence mechanism and T7SS functionality. The
supplement proposal will also provide training for a student from an underrepresented group in the area of
molecular pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions. A career development and mentorship plan is provided

the candidate student to be a competitive and successful researcher in the future."
11064573,"ABSTRACT
 Prostate cancer (PC) remains the most common cancer affecting men in the US, resulting in both a high
number of deaths but also an even greater number of survivors experiencing treatment-related toxicities.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone of therapy for both locally advanced and metastatic cases,
though it results in myriad negative effects, including increased insulin resistance and incident diabetes. The
intensified androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA), while improving overall survival, exacerbate these
negative effects. Most men with PC are older, thus at risk of, or already suffering from, comorbidities such as
diabetes and heart disease; these often represent their greatest threat tomortality.
 The ADT-induced metabolic changes may also adversely impact men at high risk of PC death by
promoting cancer progression. During ADT, insulin, leptin and IGF1 levels all increase; higher levels are linked
with more aggressive PC and may drive castration resistance. We showed in human studies that intermittent
fasting using a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) can favorably change insulin, glucose and IGF1/IGFBPs. Our FMD
trials involved patients consuming a very low-calorie plant-based FMD for 5 days while during days 6-28, patients
ate what they wanted, but were encouraged to eat per European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism
guidelines for cancer survivors. Further, we showed this approach can delay tumor progression in multiple mouse
models including PC. Based upon the above, we hypothesize that intermittent fasting using a FMD will delay PC
progression and improve metabolic health in men being treated with intensified ADT. To test this hypothesis, we
propose a three-site randomized controlled trial of an intermittent fasting intervention using a FMD vs. standard
of care for 6 months in patients with metastatic castration sensitive PC (mCSPC) starting on intensified ADT with
or without chemotherapy. For the first time, we will test the effect of FMD on improvement in PSA nadir, an early
clinical endpoint strongly correlated with better survival. We will also measure how changes in insulin and IGF1
associate with PSA nadir as one mechanism by which this dietary approach improves cancer outcomes and will
further seek to define a molecular subset of PCs which are most responsive to this diet.
 The results of this trial will have immediate impact for PC patients, both metastatic and potentially the
larger population who receive a course of ADT with definitive therapy. Thousands of men each year could be
prevented from developing or having exacerbation of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, which are
their greatest mortality threat, by using a FMD. For men with metastatic PC, improving tumor control and delaying
castration resistance would reduce morbidity, particularly skeletal complications, and improve survival. The PC
research community will gain insight into metabolic toxicity and hormonal pathway interactions with the next-
generation ARTA as well as identify molecular subtypes that benefit most from intermittent fasting using a FMD."
11063577,"Lymphedema is an incurable condition characterized by lymphatic obstruction, tissue swelling,
immune dysfunction, and fibrosis after lymphatic injury. Lymphedema affects 5 million Americans and
is associated with poor quality of life due to extremity disability, disfigurement, and risk for recurrent
limb-threatening infection. In the US, lymphedema is most commonly a consequence of lymph node
dissection for the treatment of solid tumors such as breast or pelvic cancer. Despite the fact that
lymphedema is common and morbid, there are currently no effective drug treatments. Using
preclinical rodent models of lymphedema, we have shown that 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) significantly
accelerates lymphatic regeneration following injury, restores functional lymphatic drainage, and
prevents development of lymphedema. Our overarching hypothesis is that RA-mediated
lymphangiogenesis is a promising therapy for secondary lymphedema. The objective of this proposal,
which is the first logical step towards implementing this treatment clinically, is to increase our
understanding of the mechanisms by which RAs regulate lymphangiogenesis and develop a
translational framework for the use of these compounds. The specific aims of this proposal include
Aim 1: Determine how RA selectively induces lymphangiogenesis; Aim 2: Elucidate the roles of FGFR
and VEGFR signaling in RA-mediated lymphangiogenesis; and Aim 3: Use early biomarkers of
lymphatic insufficiency to develop a predictive model that can guide initiation of RA therapy. Based
on the current lack of effective therapy, it is clear that there is a need to develop an etiology-focused
treatment for post-surgical lymphedema. The proposed studies will address important mechanistic
questions regarding RA mediated lymphangiogenesis and also develop an early biomarker based
predictive model that will guide treatment windows for RA therapy. The proposed work will
significantly improve our understanding of RA-mediated lymphangiogenesis as well as support clinical
translation of a RA as a preventative treatment regimen for post-surgical lymphedema."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-029. Entitled ‘PROTAC-based direct and oncolytic killing of EBV+ DLBCLs through synthetic lethality’, this is
an administrative supplement to our U01 award entitled ‘Synthetic lethal targeting of EBV-positive diffuse large
B cell lymphomas in persons living with HIV’.
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the commonest type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is highly
aggressive and associated with significantly worse outcomes when infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
particularly in immunosuppressed individuals such as those with HIV. Thus, understanding how EBV contributes
to cancer is essential to discovering new therapeutic approaches. In the U01 funded project, we are investigating
the hypothesis that EBV+ DLBCL are vulnerable to synthetic lethal therapeutic targeting. This is based on our
observation that EBV rewires cellular DNA repair mechanisms such that cancer cells lose homologous
recombination repair, becoming dependent on microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and therefore
susceptible to synthetic lethal agents that target MMEJ and other forms of DNA repair. Through our U01 project,
we have confirmed EBV’s influence on DNA repair mechanisms in DLBCLs and their susceptibility to synthetic
lethal agents such as PARP inhibitors and inhibitors of polymerase theta (POLθ), the MMEJ polymerase – and
continue to investigate mechanisms and novel synthetic lethal vulnerabilities of EBV+ DLBCL.
This application takes advantage of a new collaboration and a novel observation: Dr. Guangrong Zheng, at the
University of Florida College of Pharmacy, is a medicinal chemist with expertise in PROTAC (proteolysis
targeting chimera) chemistry. PROTACs are designed to degrade proteins of interest. Our novel observation
uses a PROTAC developed by Dr. Zheng to selectively degrade HDACs 3 & 8 – using this, we are able to
reactivate EBV into the lytic/replicative phase which should enable killing of EBV+ cancer cells by oncolysis. With
PROTACs in clinical trials for cancer and oncolytic therapies also in clinical trials for EBV+ lymphomas, we build
on our existing hypothesis together with Dr. Zheng to expand our synthetic lethal approach for EBV+ DLBCL.
Our new alliance with Dr. Zheng will allow us to 1) investigate the combined (i.e. synthetic lethal) effects of
inhibiting POLθ to directly kill and the HDAC3 & 8 PROTAC to indirectly kill tumor cells by forcing EBV out of the
latent state and 2) construct a first of its kind POLθ-PROTAC using existing POLθ inhibitors as warheads along
with Dr. Zheng’s expertise and library of PROTAC linkers and ligands. We anticipate this multi-pronged approach
to pave the way for more effective management of EBV+ DLBCLs and a POLθ-PROTAC to benefit many with
cancers known to be susceptible to synthetic lethal approaches."

This Program Project Grant entitled Harnessing a Two-State FEP LHS to Optimize Engagement and Prevent
Disengagement in CSC will leverage Connection Learning Healthcare System (CLHS) - a two-state learning healthcare
system and Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) hub (MH120550, Bennett PI) - to pursue integrated
research and knowledge generation focused on optimizing Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) engagement and
preventing disengagement in youth with first episode psychosis (FEP). CLHS has a demonstrated track record of
collecting, managing, and analyzing data from the EPINET Core Assessment Battery (CAB) from 23 CSC programs
across Pennsylvania and Maryland. The close collaboration and combined expertise of investigators from the University
of Maryland, the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Sheppard Pratt
Healthcare has supported practice-based data collection, hub-centered data analysis, and translation of data to practice
through learning healthcare and culture building initiatives. The group of investigators has internationally renowned
experience in research on schizophrenia, FEP, and CSC implementation, as well as in psychiatric services research,
interventions development and implementation in psychosis, cognition and cognitive assessment; neuroimaging and
brain functioning in schizophrenia, clinical trials, implementation science, psychopharmacology, culturally competent
clinical care, participatory, and peer services research. This consortium has interacted and in a superbly collaborative
manner sharing technical and scientific information through formal monthly face-to-face or Zoom-based meetings,
frequent telephone or electronic communication and across-campus visits. This offers tremendous opportunities for in-
depth study of disengagement risk and of strategies that can prevent it. The Administrative Core will build on the
infrastructure of CLHS to support two well-specified research projects and to foster additional research, knowledge
generation, and quality improvement initiatives focused on preventing CSC disengagement by providing services in
data collection, management, and analysis; supporting learning healthcare system activities that integrate CSC program
ideas into research development; and fostering involvement of participants with lived experience of psychosis and family
members to make research on disengagement responsive to the experiences of people who are directly impacted by
CSC. The Clinical Practice Data Research Project will use CLHS CAB data to develop and validate longitudinal models
for predicting risk of CSC disengagement and to integrate stakeholder input on the clinical utility of using risk information
in clinical practice. The Prospective Practice-Oriented Research Project to develop a hub-based engagement navigator
service for supporting participants and families at high risk for disengagement. We will use robust participatory research
methods to ensure the integration of CSC program staff, participants, and family members in the development of all
aspects of and materials for the navigator service and conduct a mixed methods hub wide ENS evaluation using a
hybrid type I open cohort stepped wedge design to examine feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness in changing target
mechanisms and improving disengagement outcomes."

11081538,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of my lab is to understand how cells make and maintain peroxisomes, a
ubiquitous membrane-bound organelle that harbors specialized metabolic reactions.
Peroxisomes are both versatile and dynamic: cells use them to adapt to their environment, and
thus can rapidly remodel their peroxisomes by altering enzyme content, morphology, and
number through peroxisome-specific autophagy and de novo biogenesis. Approximately 35 Pex
proteins are known to contribute to peroxisome formation and maintenance, yet the
mechanisms by which they act are not resolved at a molecular level. Furthermore, we are likely
missing many important players, especially in human cells, and this lack of basic mechanistic
knowledge hinders our understanding of how peroxisome contribute to human health, both in
rare, genetic Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBDs), and during the aging process. Our
approach is to use techniques in protein biochemistry and yeast cell biology to dissect the
mechanism of the Pex proteins, particularly focusing on the AAA-ATPase Pex1/Pex6. We aim
to identify the full repertoire of Pex1/Pex6’s endogenous substrates and the features that are
important for substrate selection. Since mutations in Pex1/Pex6 cause the majority of PBDs, we
are further focused on using disease-causing alleles to understand Pex1/Pex6 function in the
human cells and the cellular consequences of peroxisome stress induced by these alleles.
Finally, we have identified novel regulators of peroxisome homeostasis in human cells, and are
now exploring how peroxisome function integrates with the implicated canonical signaling
pathways. We anticipate that this research will improve our understanding of how peroxisomes
contribute to human health and disease."
11082258,"ABSTRACT (Project 2)
 Immune and inflammatory system functions are important to respond to infection, however, emerging
evidence suggests that alterations in these systems accompany normative aging and neurodegenerative disease
changes (like Alzheimer's disease, AD). Less deeply understood is the constitutive impact of these systems on
organs and cells throughout the life span. In the proposed work we will explore the potential impact of immune
and inflammatory processes on the brain and the influence of these processes on resistance and resilience to
age-related cognitive changes that contribute to SuperAging. The basis for this approach is the well documented
immune and inflammatory system changes noted in normative aging, the pro-inflammatory microglial changes
associated with aging and AD, and the emergence of well-validated genetic risk factors for AD that have
demonstrated the importance of immune and inflammatory system genes in risk for the disease. These findings
suggest the immune and inflammatory system may play both a role in acute responses to infection as well as
exert a long-term impact on brain health, age-related cognitive changes, and/or resilience to brain-related
diseases.
 Project 2 of the SuperAging Consortium will explore this question through the study of unique individuals
within the general population who exhibit the phenotype of cognitive SuperAging – a trait defined as a two-
decade, or greater, superiority of memory capacity when compared to age-matched peers. We propose that
immune and inflammatory system function is related to the cognitive resilience seen in SuperAging individuals –
in the opposing way that it is related to risk for AD. We hypothesize that SuperAgers (SA) will demonstrate a
shift toward neuroprotection and lower pro-inflammatory profiles compared to Control and AD participants and
that these differences will clarify mechanisms of resilience to age-related phenomena. These hypotheses will be
pursued through three aims. In Aim 1 we will profile the individual transcriptomes of microglia and other cells in
brain tissue from SAs, Controls, and AD participants. In Aim 2 we will examine three different measures of the
adaptive immune and inflammatory systems – cytokine levels, T- and B-cell receptor repertoires, and antibody
profiles – in peripheral samples from SAs, Controls, and AD participants. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will investigate the
DNA sequence variations in ~500 different immune and inflammatory system genes in SAs and Controls. This
study design will allow us to unravel the link between potentially modifiable immune and inflammatory processes
and resistance to age-related decline of cognitive capacity."
11082259,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Clinical / Imaging):
Memory complaints are widespread among the elderly and aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
(AD), leading to the impression that a gradual loss of memory ability, eventually culminating in dementia, may
be a nearly universal consequence of getting old. This Consortium will explore an alternative aging trajectory by
studying 80+ year-olds that we have labelled `SuperAgers', who have episodic memory performance that
appears to have escaped age-related decline and that remains in the range that is at least normal for 50-60-
year-olds and. The study of SuperAgers was initiated at Northwestern University and will be extended through
this Consortium. The Clinical/Imaging Core of the SuperAging Consortium will establish standardized inclusion
criteria and uniform assessments for the harmonized cross-site characterization of SuperAgers and their
Controls. Aim 1 will coordinate enrollment and harmonized data collection on at least 500 participants (300
SuperAgers, 200 Controls) across the United States and Canada into a prospective longitudinal study, which
includes health, lifestyle, and neurocognitive assessments, as well as MR imaging, blood samples, and eventual
brain donation. Particular emphasis will be placed on enhancing recruitment of diverse participants from Sites
with strengths in recruitment and sophisticated characterization of older adults. Aim 2 will support studies that
confirm and extend previous findings in a larger and more diverse cohort as well as identification of new factors
associated with unusually successful aging. Aim 3 will launch new directions of investigation through the support
of the two Projects associated with this Consortium and collaborative investigations. Outcomes from this
Consortium will substantially increase the depth and breadth of investigations on unusually successful cognitive
aging. The factors to be identified will be directly relevant to sustained cognitive health in late life and to the
concepts of resilience, resistance and cognitive reserve."
11084251,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths, and
50% for those refractory to treatment. There is increasing evidence that apnea (respiratory arrest) is the
primary cause of death from SUDEP. We have shown in a number of mouse models - including PTZ injection,
rapid kindling (prelim. data), and mouse models harboring Scn8a mutations identified from SUDEP patients -
that sudden death is due to seizure-induced apnea (SIA) that occurs during tonic seizures, minutes prior
to terminal asystole. As it pertains to this proposal, we have also made four other important observations:
1) artificial ventilation can prevent death and suppressed cardiac activity does not increase likelihood of fatality;
2) tonic contraction of breathing muscles represents a likely mechanism of SIA; 3) inhibition of cortical seizure
activity does not impact SIA; and 4) inhibition of the inspiratory oscillator does not reduce apnea (prelim. data),
suggesting seizure spread bypasses homeostatic elements of respiratory control circuitry. CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS: [AIM 1] Increased midbrain and pontine excitability is both necessary and sufficient to
produce SIA, [AIM 2] the parabrachial/kölliker fuse (PB/KF) nucleus in the pons represents a key nodal
point for SIA generation, and [AIM 3] that brainstem nuclei, like the PB/KF and PAG are recruited
specifically during SIA, which we will explore using electrophysiology and genetic mapping. AIM 1: We
have previously used chemogenetics to demonstrate that cortical ictal activity is not required for SIA and we now
propose that hyperexcitability of the pons and midbrain drive SIA and SUDEP. We will use chemogenetics to
inhibit different parts of the brainstem of Scn8a mutant mice to test their necessity for SIA and SUDEP.
Additionally, we will test sufficiency of these regions by selectively expressing an Scn8a mutation that increases
neuronal excitability. Using the rapid kindling model, we will also perform patch clamp recordings to test whether
increased neuronal excitability in these regions occurs concurrently with the development of SIA. AIM 2: The
parabrachial/kölliker fuse nucleus PB/KF in the Pons is a key nodal point for descending forebrain input and
projects past the inspiratory oscillator, and is modulated by the vagus nerve. In this aim, we will photoinhibit the
Foxp2-positive PB/KF neurons to regain normal breathing pattern during SIA, photostimulate P2ry1-positive
vagal afferent nerve fibers to interrupt inspiration during SIA, and determine if PB/KF and Npy2r-positive vagal
neuron photostimulation rescues postictal breathing in our PTZ SUDEP mouse model. AIM 3: We have
demonstrated that tonic seizures with SIA and clonic seizures without SIA can occur in the very same mouse,
both in Scn8a mutant and rapid kindling models (prelim. data) and that certain mid- and hindbrain structures are
activated during SIA. We will determine the neuronal circuitry activated specifically during SIA and SUDEP using
in vivo electrophysiology and TRAP2 identification of activated neurons."
11068635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Predicting language outcomes in children referred for early language concerns is a longstanding clinical and
scientific challenge that often results in the delayed implementation of intervention. The overarching hypothesis
of this project is that early motor skills—particularly the relatively under-studied domain of speech motor skills—
are significantly associated with language skills in late talkers and children with typical language development
and can serve as predictors of language outcomes. We will examine relationships among speech, motor, and
language skills in 24-month-old children with and without delayed language development (Aim 1); furthermore,
in the delayed language development group, we will examine relations between speech and motor skills at age
24 months and subsequent expressive language skills at age 36 months (Aim 2). To accomplish these goals, we
will derive a variety of acoustic speech features (to quantify speech precision, consistency, coordination, speed,
and rate) and language features (to quantify lexical-semantic, morphosyntactic, and phonological development)
from audio and video recordings of children participating in a semi-structured play session and a speech
elicitation task. Gross and fine motor skills will also be measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning.
Machine learning techniques will then be used to integrate multimethod data (i.e., speech, motor, and language
variables) in examining predictive relationships across domains. The results of this study will directly inform our
understanding of mechanisms underlying communication development and dysfunction and advance a precision
medicine approach to clinical decision-making. Successful completion of the project will (1) yield currently
unavailable and clinically significant information regarding language development and its association with motor
development in children with and without an early language delay; and (2) support the development of valid,
clinically feasible assessment and prognostic procedures. The candidate is a pediatric speech-language
pathologist and clinical researcher with expertise in the instrumental assessment of children’s speech. The
proposed F32 application will provide the candidate with the skills needed to investigate speech, motor, and
language development in pediatric populations through direct training in (1) the collection, analysis, and
interpretation of developmental gross and fine motor data; (2) the collection, analysis, and interpretation of
language features derived from natural language samples; and (3) advanced quantitative methodologies related
to motor analysis, language analysis, and the analysis of complex data."
11052925,"No studies to date have addressed community-based harm reduction vending machine (HRVM)
reach and effectiveness in harm reduction supply access and decreasing health disparities
among racial and ethnic minorities, persons experiencing homelessness (PEH), and justice-
involved individuals. The long-term goal is to determine if HRVMs provide an equitable
approach to accessing harm reduction supplies and improve health outcomes among people
who use drugs (PWUDs) with multiple vulnerabilities. The objective of this proposal
complements the overall research aims of the parent study and will explore the opportunity
structures that affect utilization and dispensation rates of harm reduction supplies, including
naloxone, from a community-based HRVM and understanding perceptions about accessibility
and acceptability of the community-based HRVM compared to traditional harm reduction
approaches. The central hypothesis is that HRVMs will increase equitable access to harm
reduction supplies. The rationale underlying this proposal is that Black and Latine populations
as well as PEH and justice-involved individuals experience higher risk of opioid-related
overdose, yet PWUDs with multiple vulnerabilities experience a multitude of barriers to
accessing harm reduction supplies, including naloxone. The proposed work in conjunction with
the parent grant aims to inform the development of evidence-based, equitable, low-resource,
and low-threshold harm reduction approaches to address opioid-related morbidity and mortality.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Evaluate accessibility
and acceptability of the HRVM to dispense harm reduction supplies as compared to traditional
harm reduction distribution approaches among Latine and Black Americans as well as PEH and
justice-involved persons; 2) Determine the extent to which opportunity structures affect
utilization and dispensation rates of harm reduction supplies from the HVRM among PWUDs
with multiple vulnerabilities. We will pursue these aims by conducting a mixed methods study,
including 200 cross-sectional surveys and 20 qualitative interviews with HRVM program
participants. The proposed research is significant, because it is the first study to explore the
accessibility and acceptability of a community-based HRVM dispensing naloxone and other
harm reduction supplies as well as to examine the extent to which opportunity structures affect
utilization and dispensation rates of harm reduction supplies from the HRVM on a longitudinal
basis. This work will develop foundational resources that will be used by other researchers for
equitable harm reduction approaches to increasing naloxone engagement and re-engagement."
11059534,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Occupational injuries and workplace accidents still occur on a tremendous scale, despite researchers’
development of successful occupational safety and health interventions for workplace outcomes. There is a
particularly pressing need to 1) better investigate workplace safety in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), and 2) bolster methods for substantially reducing accidents. Improving safety climate (SC), a robust
indicator of occupational safety across various industries and countries, is an effective strategy for positively
impacting workplace safety outcomes and accident reduction. Positive SC perceptions motivate employees to
act safely, which leads to safer behaviors, fewer accidents/injuries, more engagement, and less turnover.
However, there is a lack of empirical research in LMICs that examines the effectiveness of SC surveys and
interventions, in part because the established methods in high-income countries (HICs) often use in-person
training that is impractical in LMICs. For Malaysia, we will develop a mobile SC intervention program designed
to improve the safety and health of workers. The practice of medicine and healthcare using mobile devices
(e.g., cell phones, tablets), called “mHealth,” has been used in LMICs to effectively and inexpensively impact
people’s health. Using mHealth as our foundation, we will create and test an evidence-based SC intervention
program in Malaysia using instructional methods and training strategies that have been developed and
practiced in the U.S. by our team. This project will address the significant knowledge gap regarding the impact
of SC interventions in LMICs. Through our collaborative efforts, this project will also equip our colleagues in
Malaysia with effective and practical tools, new experiences, and greater knowledge related to SC, thereby
enhancing their capacity to further investigate and improve SC for workers in Malaysian organizations across
high-risk industries. Our long-term goal is to improve workers’ health and safety by providing them and their
organizations with effective strategies for building superior safety cultures and climates, which they can
implement without outside support. Through this collaboration, an additional goal of this project is to establish
strong partnerships and build the occupational safety and health research capacity in Malaysia. R21 phase
aims include: Aim 1. Translate and adapt our validated safety climate scale, other important outcome scales,
and a safety audit tool for Malaysian workforces. Aim 2. Develop an mHealth-based SC intervention program
for Malaysia's workforces to improve their workplace cultures. Aim 3. Pilot test and revise the mHealth SC
intervention program in Malaysia. R33 phase aims include: Aim 4. Implement the revised mHealth SC
intervention program in three high-risk industries to cross-validate the intervention program. Aim 5. Establish
an Initial SC Benchmark for the Malaysia workforce."

Johns Hopkins John G. Bartlett Specialty Practice (JGBSP) and Johns Hopkins HIV Women's Health Program
(JHHWHP) provides comprehensive HIV care and treatment to women (85% Black/African American) living
with HIV/AIDS in Baltimore. The network of Hopkins clinicians practicing in JGBSP and JHHWHP (called the
Hopkins HIV Collaborative) identify multiple complex unmet health and social issues daily, such as intimate
partner violence (IPV), housing instability and food insecurity that negatively impacts the health of women in
their care. The intersection of IPV, poor mental health, housing instability and food insecurity are associated
with suboptimal HIV prevention and treatment outcomes, such as antiretroviral therapy failure and unsafe
sexual practices. Approaches to IPV and social determinants of health in healthcare organizations are evolving
from interventions that targets the woman’s behavior (”she should leave the abuser”) to interventions that
partner with community organizations to address IPV as a pervasive health and social problem embedded in
structural inequities. Hopkins HIV Collaborative and Hopkins School of Nursing in partnership with community
organizations, House of Ruth, Maryland (HRM), Technical Assistance Collaborative (TAC) and Older Women
Embracing Life (OWEL) and expert Advisory Board will adapt and implement a trauma and violence informed
care (TVIC) intervention to improve HIV-related and mental outcomes by addressing social determinants of
health with abused women living with HIV/AIDS (WLWHA). TVIC is an equity-based approach guided by the
ecological framework to account for the intersecting impacts of HIV, IPV and structural inequities on a woman’s
life. The TVIC intervention includes: (1) universal education to create a safe environment in the healthcare
setting for IPV disclosure; (2) counseling and advocacy based on women strengths and priorities; (3)
coordination with community partners to address unmet social determinant of health; and 4) integration of
technology-facilitated safety planning (myPlan app) for clinic-community providers to support abused WLWHA
to develop personalize safety plans that directly link to needed local services. The clinic-community partners
will conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study to determine the effectiveness of the adapted
TVIC intervention on HIV-related (e.g. viral load/CD4 and adherence) and mental health (e.g. depression and
PTSD) outcomes with IPV(+) WLWHA and IPV (–) WLWHA. The partners will also examine mechanisms (e.g.,
safety behaviors and resources, housing security, food security) by which the TVIC intervention improves HIV-
related and mental health outcomes with abused WLWHA. Our partnership will further examine organizational,
program and contextual factors that facilitate the implementation of the TVIC intervention and are critical to
sustaining the intervention and clinic-community based partnerships."

Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death among US Latinas. Latinas are at high risk of obesity
and obesity-related diseases, which are associated with poorer cancer outcomes. There is a significant lack of
an effective intervention to address the diverse needs of Latina BC survivors to achieve a healthy weight. We
have developed and tested multi-component weight loss, dietary change, and physical activity (PA)
interventions among BC survivors, with a focus on experiential learning (EL) among Latinas. As the next step,
we propose a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) testing 12 month adaptive culturally-
tailored weight loss interventions in a geographically diverse group of Latina BC survivors. The adaptive
interventions will use the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an evidence-based weight loss program,
as the central educational component. Based on our prior work, we will adapt the DPP to be remotely
delivered, include information specific to BC survivors, and be culturally-tailored to Latinas. Women will be
recruited via 3 West Coast SEER registries. Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of stage I-III BC within 5 years, no
evidence of recurrent disease, >60 days post-treatment, and body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. Baseline, 1, 3,
6, and 12 month assessments will include questionnaires on medical history, diet, and patient-reported
psychosocial/quality of life outcomes; objectively measured weight; accelerometer measured PA; and dried
blood spots to measure inflammatory/cardiometabolic biomarkers. Qualitative interviews with a subset of
participants will take place at 1 and 12 months. The goal of the 12 month ¡Vida! (Life!) program is to achieve
7% weight loss. Following baseline assessments, participants (n=410) will be randomized to ¡Vida! or ¡Vida! +
EL. At 1 month, responders (≥2% weight loss) will continue with their intervention and non-responders (<2%
weight loss) will be re-randomized to receive augmented behavioral support (i.e., combinations of EL,
individualized health coaching, and delivered groceries). Aim 1) To compare the effectiveness of four adaptive
interventions for weight loss in Latina BC survivors, beginning with ¡Vida! or ¡Vida! + EL (Stage 1) followed by
augmented behavioral support for 11 months for non-responders (Stage 2). Aim 2) To use a novel data-driven
approach to determine whether key individual baseline characteristics moderate the effect of the adaptive
interventions on weight loss, and thus lay the groundwork for more personalized adaptive weight loss
strategies. Exploratory Aims will i) assess whether intervention engagement moderates the effect of the
adaptive interventions on weight loss; ii) compare the effects of adaptive interventions on changes in
inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers, diet quality, and PA; iii) quantitatively assess biopsychosocial
predictors/mediators of behavior change; and iv) qualitatively assess the participant experience to understand
factors that contribute to study outcomes. The trial will generate evidence on the best strategies for an
effective, scalable weight loss program to promote healthy cancer survivorship among Latina BC survivors."

11080132,"The ability coordinate breathing, suckling, and swallow is required for survival at birth. Infants with prenatal
exposure to opioids can have abnormalities in swallow efficiency and swallow-breathing coordination, sensory-
motor responses to pharyngeal stimulus, and esophageal motility reflexes, which often results in persistent
feeding difficulties. The swallow pattern generator is located within the brainstem, but it has been difficult to
study due to its location and widely dispersed neural circuits. Our preliminary studies describe a novel method
that allows for the visualization and recording of a vast number of neurons along the intermediate zone of the
medial reticular formation and Nucleus Ambiguus (NA), while preserving the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius. We
demonstrate reliable central stimulation of swallow with simultaneous optical recording of neurons in the
semicompact and compact regions of the NA, along with nerve root recordings. Activation of NA neurons
during swallow is affected by prenatal opioid exposure. Our methods also allow superimposition of optical
recordings onto subsequent immunohistochemical images to identify regional cellular phenotypes and to
confirm recording locations. Our working hypothesis is that the brainstem swallow network spans the medulla
and is vulnerable to opioids. The current application has evolved from collaborative work from two established
investigators, bringing together expertise in central neural circuitry, optical/ histological techniques, and
regulation of swallow. The proposed studies are designed to describe location and type of neurons active
during swallow, alterations when swallow is stimulated across the respiratory cycle, and the impact of neonatal

insight into swallow and clinical observation of infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS)."
11082261,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Biospecimen / Neuropathology):
Cognitive SuperAgers are 80+ year-olds with episodic memory performance that is at least as good as what
would be considered normal for 50-60-year-olds. Given the normally occurring age-related loss of memory
capacity, SuperAgers provide a unique resource for investigating the biological factors that promote resistance
and resilience to the involutional effects of age on cognition. The Northwestern SuperAging Program has made
considerable progress in addressing this question. In the course of investigations, a number of biologic,
anatomic, pathologic, and molecular features have been identified in SuperAgers, which distinguish them from
their peers with average cognition (Controls), including greater volume of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), greater
density of Von Economo neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex, fewer cortical plaques and tangles that are
characteristic of age-related Alzheimer pathology, integrity of cortical cholinergic innervation and inheritance of
different polymorphisms of the MAP2K3 gene. The goal of the proposed Consortium is to increase the subject
pool of SuperAgers and Controls and to achieve a much higher representation of African American participants.
The Biospecimen / Neuropathology Core of the SuperAging Consortium will collect and bank brain tissue and
blood products from participants, render neuropathological diagnoses, quantitate key markers of
neurodegeneration, and generate genomic, transcriptomic and plasma biomarker data for collaborative
intramural and extramural studies. It will also provide brain tissue, plasma and DNA for studies proposed in
Project 2 of this Consortium. It will enable the confirmation of previous findings in a larger cohort, and will allow
exploration of new factors that distinguish SuperAgers from Controls. The Biospecimen / Neuropathology Core
will pursue three specific aims: Aim 1. Bank blood / blood products and DNA from all participants, and
postmortem brain tissue from participants that come to autopsy. Blood products, and fixed and frozen brain
tissue will be banked, neuropathological diagnoses will be rendered and data from exome-wide analysis of DNA,
transcriptome analysis of cortical tissue, and plasma biomarkers will be generated and archived. Aim 2. Confirm
previous biologic, anatomic, pathologic and genetic findings in a significantly larger cohort of SuperAgers and
Controls obtained through this Consortium. Existing observations on the SuperAging phenotype, which were
generated in small cohorts, will be confirmed in a larger pool of participants. Aim 3. Explore new factors that
may distinguish SuperAgers from Controls in a large cohort, including measures of neuronal and synaptic
integrity. The assembled team of investigators has extensive expertise and record of productivity relevant to
achieving the goals of this core. The activities of the Biospecimen / Neuropathology Core will facilitate
investigation of factors that may contribute to the SuperAging phenotype and will help identify potential targets
for interventions that will allow normal elderly to preserve cognitive function and combat dementia."

the ability of the antisense strand to complementarily bind to specific mRNA within the target cell. siRNA drug
development requires overcoming the poor pharmacological properties of nucleic acids, including their rapid
degradation by ubiquitous nucleases and poor drug delivery to target organs. One chemical modification
commonly employed for siRNA involves the conversion of the natural phosphodiester nucleotide linkage into a
phosphorothioate (PS) linkage. This modification confers nuclease resistance and enhances protein binding. A
by-product of this modification is the PS linkage is chiral creating diastereomers. The number of diastereomers
within a PS oligonucleotide scale at a rate of 2n, where n is the number of PS linkages. PS diastereomers are
expected to impact the physiochemical and biological properties of oligonucleotide therapeutics. This has
important ramifications for drug efficacy and drug dosing. Additional considerations include uncharacterized
and/or uncontrolled PS diastereomer compositions adversely impact active ingredient bioequivalence. These
are critical for accurate drug labeling for reference listed drug products and development of generic drug options.
Thus, characterization of the oligonucleotide PS diastereomer composition is highly consequential. Currently
there are five FDA approved siRNAs, four of which have a covalently linked ligand containing three N-
acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues to facilitate drug delivery to hepatocytes. These GalNAc-conjugated
siRNAs have six terminal PS linkages, and thus the final drug product is a mixture of different diastereomers.
Four of the PS linkages are in the antisense strand and two in the sense strand. The number of diastereomers
for these GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs is limited (16 for the antisense strand, 4 for the sense strand), which makes
it plausible to investigate how each diastereomer behaves and contributes to the overall activity of the drug
product. Consequently, the purpose of this proposal is to develop innovative synthetic chemistry,
pharmacological assays, and analytical methods to systematically evaluate the diastereomeric composition of
LEQVIO (Inclisiran), an FDA-approved, GalNAc-conjugated siRNA drug. This will be achieved by determining
the activity of each diastereomer in LEQVIO through stereochemically-controlled synthesis, biological activity
assessment using in vitro and animal models, and accurate characterization of the stereochemical structure of
each diastereomer. Our developed methods will be directly transferable to other synthetic oligonucleotides and
will greatly facilitate the development and assessment of generic oligonucleotide drug products."

State of the art methods for the early detection and monitoring of cancer are either invasive, time-consuming,
expensive, or frequently inaccurate, which hinders the routine screening of at risk-patients to improve survival
rates. The multiplexed detection of oncometabolites circulating in minimally or non-invasive biofluids, such as
saliva, blood plasma, or sweat, could provide significant clinical and economic benefits. Metabolites and related
circulating biomarkers are structurally unique elements with distinctive absorptive fingerprints in the infrared (IR)
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Common approaches that provide multiplexed metabolite detection,
such as mass spectrometry (MS), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
are expensive and difficult to miniaturize. On the other hand, inexpensive miniaturized electrochemical techniques
lack specificity, sensitivity, ease, and suffer from limited multiplexing. Portable technologies capable of rapid and
accurate diagnostics of early/late-stage cancer are not readily available.
To address this challenge, our multidisciplinary team proposes an innovative Neural Network Enabled Cancer
Spectroscopy (NNECS) liquid biopsy platform based on plasmonic nano-micro electromechanical systems
(NMEMS) to diagnose and monitor early/late-stage head neck cancer (HNC). Instead of targeting individual
metabolites, we propose to process the entire IR spectrum of saliva, blood plasma, and sweat as a biomarker.
Our focus is head and neck cancer (HNC), a highly metabolic disease where stratification of patients according
to better diagnostic information would greatly improve outcomes. Our platform combines IR NMEMS sensors to
accurately detect IR spectral fingerprints with neural network (NN) frameworks to find the appropriate
combinations of spectral bands that will inform the design of highly multiplexed miniaturized biosensor.
We will take a novel, interdisciplinary approach within the framework of five key components: (i) collecting and
analyzing (FTIR, MS, histopathology/imaging) biofluids (saliva, sweat, blood) from a large number of early/late
stage HNC patients and healthy subjects per year; (ii) developing powerful NN architectures and diagnosis tools
for segregating early/late-stage HNC samples from controls, considering IR data streams from each individual
biofluid as well as their potential combinations; (iii) developing a NNECS platform using arrays of plasmonic
NMEMS targeting specific IR bands resolved by ML algorithms; (iv) determining NNECS early/late-stage cancer
detection performance in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy; and (v) elucidating which metabolites
drive the changes in the IR absorption of cancer biofluids supported by MS. The expected outcome is a
miniaturized, label-free, affordable, and accurate technology able to radically improve the ability to diagnose early-
stage HNC as well as the monitoring of recurrent HNC patients. Moving beyond, NNECS can be adapted for the
diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of metabolic conditions, including many types of cancer, diabetes, and
heart-diseases."

 The GREGoR Consortium (Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases) is an
NHGRI-funded research network that aims to develop and apply approaches to determine the genetic etiology
of rare, Mendelian conditions. Specific objectives include: 1) to shift the paradigm of rare disease diagnosis; 2)
to develop best practices for clinical translation; and 3) to create a dataset with broad utility. GREGoR seeks to
achieve these objectives through the development of new multi-omic technologies including transcriptomic,
metabolomic, epigenomic, and proteomic profiles. While GREGoR has been successful in generating multi-
omic data, the meaning, interpretation, and clinical implications of these data for individual patients remains
complex and uncertain, and currently there are no guidelines for return of Individual Research Results (IRRs)
specifically for multi-omics. While existing literature on genomic IRR is informative, it is insufficient to address
the many nuanced complexities and additional uncertainties that characterize multi-omic data. With the
growing volume of multi-omic research data, there is an urgent need for empirical bioethics research to support
development of guidelines for return of multi-omic IRR. Examples of key ethical questions include: How should
the validity of multi-omic IRR be determined? How should the risks of returning uncertain information be
weighed against potential benefits for participants? In the setting of limited resources, what is the appropriate
balance of effort on return of multi-omic IRR with achieving other scientific goals?
 To address these and other questions, we propose the following Aims: Aim 1: To identify the range of
ethical, legal, scientific, and pragmatic challenges to the return of multi-omic IRR to rare disease participants.
To achieve this Aim, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with a broad range of stakeholders both within
and outside of the GREGoR Consortium, including patient advocates, clinicians, scientists, genetic counselors,
legal experts, ethicists, and IRB members. Aim 2: To identify opportunities for the GREGoR Consortium to
address key challenges to multi-omic IRR. To achieve this Aim, we will create a draft conceptual map,
informed by ongoing Aim 1 interviews and the existing literature on return of genomic IRR, outlining challenges
to return of multi-omics IRR. We will then convene a facilitated workshop, in conjunction with an existing
GREGoR in-person meeting, to discuss approaches with GREGoR leaders, collaboratively elicit individuals’
perspectives on potential solutions, and identify opportunities for GREGoR address these challenges. The
long-term goal of this research is to develop and refine ethical and policy guidelines related to return of multi-
omic IRR and clinical translation of new multi-omic technologies."

Recently, remarkable progress has been made in cancer treatment employing adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of
tumor-specific “killer”, CD8+ T cells. Various engineered T cells including chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)
cells, have shown great potential as new forms of cancer therapies. However, a hostile tumor microenvironment
(TME) impedes T cell infiltration and survival and induces T cell dysfunction (i.e., ‘exhaustion’), making the
beneficial effects of the therapy transient. Exhausted T cells (TEX) arise when T cells are stimulated by antigen
for prolonged periods, which drives a defined differentiation process involving major transcriptional and
epigenetic changes in T cells. Thus, there have been attempts to promote intratumoral T cell
trafficking/proliferation but challenges with poor long-term survival and efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells
in solid tumors still remain. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to engineer T cells that better infiltrate and
survive inside tumors to provide robust, durable anti-tumor T cell immunity.
By combining (1) the expertise of the Dr. Kaech lab in effector and memory T cell development, (2) that
of the Dr. Wang lab in integrative analysis of epigenomic/genomic data, and (3) that of Dr. Chung in protein
engineering, this research will provide novel solution to the current limitation in ACT. Preliminary research
generated epigenetic and transcriptional atlas of CD8+T cells and analyzed the transcription factor networks of
the most tumoricidal, tumor-infiltrating “effector” T cell state, the long-lasting “resident-memory” T cell state and
dysfunctional “exhausted” T cell state. Based on the understanding of T cell differentiation states, this proposal
aims to design key transcription factor programs that drive desired T cell states and devise new methodologies
to redirect T cell exhaustion state to toggle desirable effector and memory states and to temporally and
combinatorically control the cell-state specific TFs of the adoptively transferred T cells in situ.
 This new class of T cell engineering platform is termed SMARTER (Specific Modifiers Assisted
Reprogramming of T cell Engineered with Regulability). To generate SMARTER T cells, in Aim 1, a new platform
will be devised to systemically identify novel cell-state-specific transcription factors. In Aim 2, synthetic machinery
will be developed to rewire exhaustion signals to specific differentiation program. Lastly, in Aim 3, a clinically
useable synthetic biology methods will be developed to enable temporal and combinatorial control of the cell-
state-specific modifiers. This SMARTER platform will effectively transform T cells into “intelligent and tenacious
soldiers”. These enhanced T cells will not only effectively infiltrate and kill cancer cells, but also retain the
immunological memory of their “foes” and reside long-term at the tumor site, leading to complete remission."

 Approximately 1.2 million people are currently living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States. These individuals
are at an elevated risk for various cancers, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (BCLs), such as diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. These lymphomas often display comorbidity with Epstein-Barr
virus infection (EBV). The use of combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been shown to effectively control
HIV replication, leading to restored immune function and decreased cancer rates in PLWH. Moreover, the latest
developments in cancer treatment, along with cART, have significantly increased the success rates for PLWH
battling cancer. Despite such advancements in treatment and improved survival rates, effectively managing
cancers in PLWH demands a comprehensive approach – one that takes into consideration the specific traits of
these malignancies when in the presence of HIV.
 HIV and EBV, which solely infect human hosts, create a unique obstacle in the development of in vivo models
for assessing potential cancer therapies. Humanized mice with a functional human blood system offer a valuable
model for studying immunotherapeutic approaches for BCLs under HIV and EBV co-infection. Through our
recent single-cell transcriptomics analysis of humanized mice, we have discovered that the NSG-SGM3 mouse
outperforms the standard NSG mouse in its ability to mimic various types of human blood cells found in human
peripheral blood. Developing a murine model with a realistic human tumor microenvironment largely relies on
this critical factor. This model is integral in evaluating the effectiveness of immune-based cancer therapies and
monitoring immunological changes throughout treatment. The proposed study aims to confirm the effectiveness
of new CAR-T cell approaches for treating BCLs in the presence of HIV while examining its immunological impact
using a humanized NSG-SGM3 mouse model."
11065985,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common and third most fatal cancer among women worldwide. Cervical cancer
is an AIDS-defining illness and the most common cancer among women living with HIV (WLWH) globally.
Overall, WLWH have a higher risk of HPV acquisition, lower risk of HPV clearance, higher incidence of high
grade lesions (HGSIL), reduced regression from HGSIL to normal, and higher incidence of cervical cancer
compared to women without HIV. However, little is known about the biological mechanism of cervical pre-cancer.
It is estimated that there are 250,000-1 million new cases of cervical pre-cancer each year in the U.S. requiring
treatment for these pre-cancerous lesions. Even with the WHO’s 90-70-90 cervical cancer elimination strategy,
where they expect to treat 90% of the pre-cancer women, the unwanted effects of invasive treatment should not
be overlooked. Not all pre-cancers progress to cancer and identifying biomarkers associated with progression
could help with treatment algorithms (specifically in HIV). One compelling hypothesis is that additional molecular
events besides human papillomavirus (HPV) are required for cervical pre-cancer development as well as
progression to high grade lesions and biological aging is a likely event at the molecular level. Several studies
suggest that HIV induces alterations of the host biology and in doing so these alterations can accelerate
biological aging. HIV-related aging potentially results in impairing the immune system so that it can no longer
control the risk for cancer. Immune cell profiles using methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) and
leukocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) have been shown to be associated with risk of different cancers, including
HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer; however, there are no reports of studies in pre-cancer, which is a pre-cursor
to cancers that will have impactful prevention strategies. In the proposed study, we will examine the association
of two biomarkers of aging (aging-related inflammation and DNA methylation) with cervical pre-cancer in WLWH
and compare with HIV-negative women in two races (Black and White). To achieve the goal, we will utilize tissues
from: a) “coexisting” normal and pre-cancer lesions from each individual and b) pre-cancer progression lesion
samples collected longitudinally from the same individual from two different time-points. This design allows
validation of results using two different study designs. We will focus on the different neoplastic tissues and utilize
cell isolation techniques and nucleotide processing technologies that allow comprehensive methylation assays
to derive two biomarkers of aging, immune-cell profile (Aim 1) and biological age (Aim 2), using state-of-the-art
computational algorithms. This innovative study will bridge the gap in translating molecular knowledge of cervical
pre-cancer progression and potentially provide insights into development of aging biomarkers. There is potential
demethylation mechanism that will significantly advance management and treatment of cervical pre-cancer
lesions as well as therapeutic vaccine development, specifically in vulnerable populations (HIV status and race)."

 students, with rates worsening since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
 (CBT) is the leading evidence-based intervention for anxiety, but many students fail to complete exercises
 between CBT sessions, reducing its effectiveness. Socially assistive robots (SARs) help promote
adherence to home-based practice in the context of elder care, social skill learning, and physical therapy,
 but it is unknown how SARs can enhance CBT. The specific objective of this research is to develop
personalized CBT SARs that can support CBT compliance for college students with anxiety. To meet the
goals of the proposed work, we will conduct eight collaborative design sessions and three user studies
 and data collections and evaluations: Specifically, studies will determine how SAR personalization based
on implicit and explicit feedback can help promote greater CBT compliance and anxiety reduction
 outcomes for students. Specific Aim 1 will develop machine learning models to personalize a CBT SAR
 with implicit personalization–using only visual and auditory cues and no user input. Specific Aim 2 will
develop machine learning models to enhance SAR engagement based on explicit user feedback–using
direct input from the user to change the SAR behaviors. Specific Aim 3a will test the efficacy of
 personalized CBT SARs on key outcomes of a 6-week CBT for anxiety intervention: robot-student
 alliance, CBT engagement, CBT adherence, and anxiety symptom reduction. In Study 3a, n=60 students
with anxiety will be randomly assigned to either a CBT SAR that performs implicit personalization (n=30)
or a CBT SAR with no personalization (control, n=30). In Aim 3b, a separate sample of n=60 students will
 be randomly assigned to either complete a 6-week CBT SAR intervention that performs explicit
personalization (n=30) or a CBT SAR with no personalization (control, n=30). We predict that implicit and
 explicit CBT SAR personalization will enhance pre- versus post-intervention SAR-user alliance,
 engagement in CBT, and lower anxiety outcomes over the course of a 6-week daily CBT home-based
 intervention for anxiety compared to the non-personalized control CBT SAR.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 The proposed research is relevant to public health, as it will assess whether personalized SARs impact
 engagement and outcomes in CBT exercises for anxiety, which is key to developing effective, scalable
 treatments for mood disorders such as anxiety. This research aligns with the NIMH mission of leveraging
 novel methods to intuitively and intelligently collect, sense, connect, analyze and interpret data from
 individuals, devices and systems to enable discovery and optimize health."

We propose to build upon the STAR-OM study (R01 DA050486) to assess if providing psycho-behavioral
interventions and medications for people with primary methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) and without
opioid use disorder (OUD) at methadone clinics is feasible and acceptable. In Vietnam and many US settings,
clinics providing medication for OUD (especially methadone clinics) are the only viable option for evidence-
based addiction treatment. Importantly, many of these clinics are at primary care level and therefore accessible
to people with primary MUD, who are in dire need for effective treatment. Furthermore, providers in methadone
clinics are capable of conducting psycho-behavioral interventions, which remain the first line of treatment for
MUD, and prescribing medications should these medications become available and approved by authorities. It
remains unknown, however, if methadone clinics could serve as treatment facilities for those with primary
MUD. In this Supplement to our STAR-OM study, we will 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of three
recruitment strategies to enroll people with MUD and without OUD in MUD treatment at methadone clinics and
2) explore the feasibility and acceptability of providing psycho-behavioral interventions as well as challenges in
providing medications at methadone clinics for people with MUD and without OUD. In Aim 1, we will screen
600 people with primary MUD recruited through three strategies (peer outreach, snowballing and social media)
over 3 months to enroll 60 people with MUD and without OUD into the study interventions. Participants will be
screened at MMT clinics for meth use and readiness for MUD intervention. We will monitor recruitment rate for
each strategy to assess feasibility. We will assess acceptability through focus group discussions with people
who support recruitment (N=2 focus group with 12-16 participants), in-depth interviews with individuals eligible
for enrollment and agree or decline to participate in the study interventions (N=15, 5 per recruitment strategy).
In Aim 2, consenting participants will be randomized 1:1:1 into three arms of interventions over 12 weeks: (1)
contingency management only; (2) group-based Matrix plus contingency management; and (3) individual-
based Matrix plus contingency management. All participants will be required to provide urine samples
randomly once a week. We will monitor participation and retention rate in each treatment arm and completion
of urine drug screens to assess feasibility. We will assess acceptability through post-intervention in-depth
interviews with 15 participants, focus groups with methadone providers who deliver behavioral interventions (N
= 1 focus group with 6-8 participants), and in-depth interviews with policy makers at national and city levels
(N=5). In addition, we will ask participants in these interviews and focus groups about the challenges and
facilitators of providing medications for treatment of MUD at MMT clinics should they become available.
Findings from this Supplement will be used to prepare for a larger trial to assess effectiveness of implementing
psycho-behavioral interventions for people with primary MUD and without OUD at methadone clinics."

suite of `omic' technologies to measure environmental exposures and their response across all life stages to
help NIH funded researchers determine how the environment affects human health, development and risk of
disease across the life span. In the last 3 years we have expanded our laboratory resources to include liquid

speed the pace of our jobs. In addition we doubled the number of mass spectrometers from 7 to 14 and hired
additional faculty all in preparation for this renewal application. We will leverage our substantial institutional
investments, including our new $30 million Institute for Exposomics, to serve the HHEAR Lab network and its
NIH researcher clients. Our Untargeted Resource will use molecular enviromics and metabolomics to measure
exposure to environmental chemicals and their metabolites as well as the internal response to those
exposures. We will supplement those measures with metallomics, proteomics and lipidomics. However, we are
cognizant of the ever-changing landscape of health research and have included Microbiome and Viromics to
prempt the NIH funded researchers' interest in including these measures to existing studies. We have state-of-

continue to offer these well-established methods to HHEAR clients, we are also committed to listening to the
needs of HHEAR users and develop new biomarkers to meet those needs. Our Developmental core will build
upon its highly successful work in creating novel methods to measure current and past chemical exposures in
novel biological matrices (e.g. teeth, hair, placenta, neonatal dry blood spots) and develop new assays that
arise from HHEAR's targeted and environmental resources. Our Administrative Core will coordinate planning

Data Center and the other HHEAR Network Hubs. Internally, the Administrative Core will streamline and
prioritize HHEAR jobs, assess assay needs, promote and disseminate new assays as they are developed,
harmonize protocols and QA/QC procedures and coordinate day-to-day operations. Our Hub will advise
applicants on sample requirements, sample quality, results interpretation, sample collection, storage protocols

Cortical mechanisms for contrast gain control in auditory perception in noise.
Everyday natural auditory environments are variable, ranging from quiet beaches to raging waterfalls. In order
to identify and robustly encode important sounds like speech from the background noise, the auditory system
needs to flexibly adapt to the current environment. One way the auditory system does this is by modifying neuron
response properties according to the statistics of the auditory environment. Neurons in the primary auditory
cortex (A1) adapt response function slope (gain) to account for changes in auditory variability (contrast). This
gain adaptation process is associated with corresponding changes in perceptual sensitivity. The mechanisms
driving this process are still unknown. The goal of this proposal is to identify the circuit mechanisms
responsible for contrast-dependent perceptual changes and neuronal gain adaptation in A1. In addition
to excitatory neurons, A1 comprises many types of inhibitory interneurons. Two subtypes, parvalbumin-positive
(PV) and somatostatin-positive (SST) interneurons, are capable of shaping the gain of their surrounding
excitatory neurons. We hypothesize that PV and SST neurons work together to differentially adapt neuron gain
to auditory contrast. We will first test this hypothesis by establishing whether PV and SST neurons are sensitive
to the environment’s contrast. Using electrophysiological recordings with optotagging, we will record PV and SST
neuron activity in mouse A1. Next, we will test whether SST and PV activity drives the perceptual sensitivity
changes associated with gain adaptation. By optogenetically perturbing PV and SST activity in A1 of mice
performing target-in-noise detection tasks with variable stimulus contrasts, we will quantify the relative
contributions of PV and SST neurons to perceptual sensitivity changes. Together, these results will characterize
the roles of inhibitory cortical circuits in adaptation to the current auditory environment, deepening our
understanding of effective auditory processing in noisy environments."
11062917,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarincomas (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis and is
characterized by a unique microenvironment that is severely depleted of amino acids (AAs). Dietary AA
interventions, such as serine/glycine (Ser/Gly)-free diet, can reduce PDAC tumor burden. However, PDAC cells
can regulate various pathways to adapt, grow and survive in response to AA starvation, including transcription,
mRNA translation, elongation, and the mRNA translation efficiencies (mTE) of codons. By regulating the mTE of
codons, PDAC cells allow selective mRNA translation that are required for the adaptation to nutrient poor
microenvironments of a tumor. Therefore, we propose that targeting the pathways that regulate the mTE of
codons can provide novel therapeutic avenues to improve the outcome of patients with PDAC and other cancers
 I previously found that Ser-deprivation decreases the mTE of two out of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT
(TC[C/T]), to selectively suppress and promote the synthesis of TC[C/T]-rich and -poor genes, respectively.
Interestingly, TC[C/T]-poor genes are significantly enriched in adaptive pathways required for survival, such as
cell cycle, transcription, and secreted factors. Whereas suppression of TC[C/T]-rich proteins can promote
immune escape. By blocking the mTE differences in Ser-deprived conditions, we would be able to prevent the
activation of multiple adaptive pathways that are required for survival upon Ser-limitation in PDAC tumors.
However, the mechanism(s) that regulate the mTE of Ser codons in response to Ser-limitation are not known.
 My research focus is to decipher the regulation, effects, and role of human Ser codons on mRNA translation
during PDAC tumorigenesis, and to harness these findings to identify novel therapeutic strategies in the
treatment of PDAC and other cancers. Using a whole genome CRISPR screen, we have already identified
ELAC2, a 3' pre-tRNA processing enzyme, as a key mTE regulator of Ser-codons in PDAC cells starved of Ser.
Here, we will elucidate the upstream signaling cascade(s) that sense Ser-starvation to alter the mTE of Ser
codons, determine the downstream mechanism(s) that control mTE differences, and to assess the importance
of mTE regulation of Ser codons during PDAC tumorigenesis.
 By elucidating the upstream signaling cascades, downstream mechanisms, and functions in detail, we will
gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of human Ser codons on mRNA translation in response to the
nutrient environment during PDAC tumorigenesis. We will identify multiple therapeutic strategies to block mTE
differences that allow the activation of Ser codon-driven adaptive pathways during PDAC tumorigenesis. This
work also will reveal mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of other human genetic diseases, such as
intellectual disabilities associated with ELAC2 and TPRKB mutations. A comprehensive understanding of the
roles of Ser codons on mRNA translation in response to the nutrient environment can establish a new paradigm
“tumor nutrient-codon preferences” as an Achilles' heel during the tumorigenesis of PDAC and other cancers."
11064424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in the US. Most lung cancers are not
diagnosed until after the cancer has already metastasized; stage IV patients have 5-year survival rate of only
8.2%. While in the past stage IV patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common
histology, were treated with chemotherapy, in recent years novel systemic therapies, such as targeted therapy
and immunotherapy, have been introduced and have substantially changed the landscape of late stage lung
cancer outcomes. Early-stage, surgical patients have been shown to benefit from adjuvant targeted therapy as
well. Targeted therapies work by inhibiting specific molecular pathways, the most commonly targeted of which
is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase pathway. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK), KRAS, and BRAF pathways are other targetable oncogenic pathways. These novel therapies require
genetic testing as a basis for treatment to ensure that a druggable target is present, as not all tumors present
themselves with target mutations. About 30% of NSCLC patients will be eligible. Immunotherapies, specifically
drugs that inhibit the protein 1–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1–PD-L1) pathway, can also substantially
improve survival in a subset of NSCLC patients, but are usually prescribed to only those patients with a high
PD-1 tumor mutational burden (TMB). Preliminary evidence suggests that utilization of novel target therapies
and immunotherapy is disproportionately different according to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, which
may partially explain the disparate survival outcomes in these groups of patients. More specifically, Black
NSCLC patients may be less likely to receive molecular testing compared to White patients, making them less
likely to access targeted treatments. However, no studies have yet to investigate the prevalence of oncogenic
panel testing, meaningful for both targeted or immunotherapy treatment, in a population-based dataset such as
SEER-Medicare, overall and according to race and access to quality care. To address this critical research
gap, we propose the following aims: Aim 1a) Use SEER-Medicare claims data to investigate the prevalence of
molecular tests among Black vs White advanced NSCLC patients. Aim 1b) Investigate how NSLC genetic
testing varies by urban vs rural clinical practice. We hypothesize that molecular testing is significantly less
likely to be performed among Black and rural NSCLC patients. This project will give important information on
one of the main reasons for the high mortality observed in minority and minoritized NSCLC patients, while
offering an opportunity for training in health disparities research, statistical analysis of large datasets, analysis
and interpretation of genetic data. Thus the proposed aims of this supplement complement well the scope and
mission of the original parent grant which is to expand capacity in genetics and genomic cancer research."

11064630,"Pleural fibrosis is the scarring of the pleura resulting in restrictive lung disease and impaired lung function. The
pathophysiological mechanism of pleural fibrosis is unclear. The interactions between resident and
inflammatory cells, profibrotic mediators and coagulation factors, and fibrinolytic pathways are integral to
pleural remodeling and fibrosis. Increasing evidence affirm the critical role of pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs)
in pleural fibrosis development, mainly through a process termed mesothelial to mesenchymal transition
(MesoMT). MesoMT is characterized by increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)/collagen 1
(Col-1)/fibronectin (FN), and enhanced cell migration/invasion. Currently, there are no pharmacologic
treatments for this disease. Therefore, identification of novel targets and therapeutic strategies is an important
goal for the public health. However, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in mechanisms controlling MesoMT
during pleural fibrosis. Our preliminary data strongly support that dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (DOCK2) is a
crucial regulator of MesoMT to promote pleural fibrosis. In primary human PMCs (HPMCs), DOCK2 was
induced by the potent MesoMT inducer TGF-β. DOCK2 knockdown blocked TGFβ-induced MesoMT maker
expression and cell migration. Snail as a transcriptional factor controlling epithelial to mesenchymal transition
was found critical in TGF-β-induced MesoMT. DOCK2 knockdown inhibited TGF-β-induced Snail expression
and activation of Smad2/3 and NF-κB signaling, which have been shown to upregulate Snail expression in
various cell types. DOCK2 knockdown also suppressed TGF-β-induced Rac1 activation in HPMCs. In addition,
we found that DOCK2 was dramatically induced in the fibrotic pleura of human pleuritis patients and in pleural
fibrosis models induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep), carbon black/bleomycin (CBB), and TGF-β.
DOCK2 knockout mice were significantly protected from Strep-induced pleural fibrosis. Based on these
findings, our overall hypothesis is that DOCK2 mediates MesoMT and increases PMC migration/invasion to
promote pleural fibrosis, which will be tested in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if DOCK2
promotes pleural MesoMT via upregulation of Snail. Further, we will test whether DOCK2 increases Snail
through activating Smad2/3 and NF-κB signaling. In Aim 2, we will test if DOCK2 promotes pleural MesoMT
with increased cell migration/invasion. Specifically, we will determine if DOCK2 mediates TGF-β-induced
cytoskeletal reorganization, migration, and invasion via activating Rac1. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that DOCK2 knockout blocks pleural fibrosis via inhibiting MesoMT in vivo. We will determine if general and
mesothelial cell-specific DOCK2 knockout mice are protected from Strep, CBB, and TGF-β induced pleural
fibrosis through suppressing MesoMT in vivo. Completion of the proposed studies will establish the pivotal role
and mechanisms of DOCK2 in promoting pleural fibrosis by regulating MesoMT, which may ultimately
contribute to the identification of novel targeted therapies for this important but refractory clinical problem."

This proposal is for a Diversity Supplement to R37CA273232 to support a graduate student
Benjamin Kroger. Below is the abstract for the parent award, and as part of this diversity
supplement, Mr. Kroger will be contributing to studies performing ribosome proﬁling to
identify key LSC regulators selectively translated in the context of regulated protein
synthesis.
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) promote therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes in
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Central to the function of LSCs is a capacity for aberrant
self-renewal, but the mechanisms underlying this activity are not well understood. The
long-term goal is to identify these mechanisms to develop new therapies that can eradicate
LSCs to improve clinical outcomes. The overall objectives in this application are to (i)
determine if LSCs from speciﬁc genetic subtypes of AML are dependent on regulation of
protein synthesis, (ii) determine whether LSCs in high-risk hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-
like AMLs are more dependent on regulated protein synthesis, and (iii) test a novel
therapeutic strategy inhibiting protein synthesis in LSCs. The central hypothesis is that
LSCs aberrantly self-renew by adopting from normal HSCs a dependence on tightly
regulated protein synthesis. The rationale for this project is based on the ﬁnding that the
cell surface marker CD99 is selectively overexpressed on LSCs and serves to regulate
protein synthesis to promote LSC function. This offers a strong scientiﬁc framework by
which new strategies to deplete LSCs can be developed. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three speciﬁc aims: 1) Determining the role of regulated protein
synthesis in promoting LSC function; 2) Determining if the cell-of-origin of AML inﬂuences
the dependence of LSCs on regulated protein synthesis; and 3) Determining if inhibition of
protein synthesis can deplete LSCs in high-risk AML. In the ﬁrst aim, genetically engineered
mice will be used to generate models of AML lacking CD99, to test if this leads to
dysregulated protein synthesis that impairs LSC self-renewal. LSCs from these models will
be evaluated to determine if they require low protein synthesis rates to prevent induction of
tumor suppressors, the unfolded protein response, and the integrated stress response.
Ribosome proﬁling will be performed to identify key LSC regulators selectively translated in
the context of regulated protein synthesis. In the second aim, we will generate a mouse
model of HSC-like AML which mimics high-risk human AML. We will assess if LSCs in HSC-
like AML exhibit heightened sensitivity to dysregulated protein synthesis. These studies will
be complemented with an evaluation of protein synthesis in HSC-like human LSCs to
determine if they also require maintenance of low levels of protein synthesis. The third aim
will test if the combination of a ribosome biogenesis-inhibitor with a BCL2-inhibitor
currently used to treat AML can eradicate LSCs in high-risk HSC-like AML. The proposal is
innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it aims to leverage a novel LSC-speciﬁc cell
surface marker to establish a new paradigm for understanding mechanisms underlying
LSC self-renewal. The proposed research is signiﬁcant because it is expected to provide a
strong scientiﬁc justiﬁcation for the development of therapies inhibiting protein synthesis
to overcome therapeutic resistance in patients with high-risk AML. Ultimately, the
knowledge gained from these studies may offer insights into the mechanisms that promote
the function of cancer stem cells in general, opening up opportunities for the development
of new strategies to treat cancer."
11065556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is an opioid withdrawal syndrome that develops shortly after birth to in
utero-exposed neonates. Newborns with NAS typically receive care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
(NICU), where the daily cost of care is high, costing $1.5 billion per the 22,000 infants born with NAS each
year. [1] Although there are medication-based interventions for the treatment of NAS, which are used in up to
80% of opioid-exposed infants, these treatments carry their own risks of toxicity and drug interactions. [2]
Despite the steep medical costs and the risks of treatment, current tools to assess the severity of NAS are
subjective and suffer from examiner bias. [3] There is an urgent need for innovative new methods to reliably
diagnose NAS and thoroughly assess the efficacy of responses to treatment.
Rekovar has worked diligently to develop Neomonki (Neonatal Monitoring Kit), a simple economical solution to
objectively assess and treat NAS. Neomonki is an affordable, wearable monitoring device that reports
measures of behavioral and physiological symptoms correlating to NAS that may otherwise go unnoticed to
healthcare professionals. Neomonki consists of wireless wearable wristbands fitted with biosensor technology,
a tablet fitted with Rekovar’s healthcare portal enhanced with robust encryption/data collection capabilities, a
charging dock station which powers the tablet and allows easy access to recharge the wristbands, a camera
attached to the dock station to analyze imaging properties, and a portable cart which holds the dock station
and allows for easy repositioning of Neomonki. Neomonki will revolutionize neonatal healthcare with a cutting-
edge AI clinical algorithm that analyzes biosensor and imaging data to deliver predictive NAS analytics and
enhance diagnostic decision-making. Rekovar has successfully pursued several objectives to enhance the
performance of Neomonki, including size reduction and improved functionality and safety features. Rekovar
has also made strides in improving Neomonki’s software graphical user interface, ensuring that it is user-
friendly and functional. However, the success of the device is contingent upon the development of the AI
algorithm for assessing patient symptoms and prescribing appropriate treatments.
This proposal revolves around the collection of data in clinical trials to develop, optimize, and refine an
algorithm for assessing NAS symptoms in neonatal patients with the Neomonki. This will be done in two
phases: i) the collection of data in clinical trials and development/validation of the algorithm, and ii) submitting a
central IRB submission to deploy Neomonki in clinical trials collecting efficacy and safety data for premarket de
novo approval. These clinical trials will compare the performance of Neomonki against the currents standards
of care used by participating hospitals. A key milestone of this stage of the project is to assess whether the
optimized automated digital scoring and suggested treatment algorithm can reduce infant suffering, shorten
hospital stays, and decrease daily costs. Achieving this milestone will allow Neomonki to be used commercially
to automate digital assessments and treat patients."

Abstract
Lung cancer is the single largest contributor to global cancer mortality. With the exception of smoking, age is the
single biggest risk factor for all major lung diseases, including cancer, highlighting the role of age-associated
changes in the lung for mortality. Metabolic changes and epigenetic alterations are both hallmarks of aging, but
little is known about how aging specifically impacts the lung and in particular lung progenitor cells. Furthermore,
the synergy between metabolism and epigenetic states is emerging as an exciting new field for which implications
in disease including cancer are only beginning to be explored. Preliminary data we have collected suggest that
both metabolic and epigenetic changes accompany aging in lung alveolar type II (AT2) cells, the primary cell-of-
origin of the most common form of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma. Our study will test the hypothesis that
alterations in metabolic pathways driven by epigenetic changes in AT2 cells contribute to increased tumor
initiation during aging. Firstly, we will map metabolic and epigenetic changes in aged AT2 cells using state of the
art technologies that will enable resolution of these differences onto highly select populations and even single
cells. Furthermore, we will create new models to study the effects of aging in cancer. New organoid models of
lung cancer initiation will be developed to support rapid modeling of the cellular and molecular aspects of cancer
in aged cells. Genetically engineered mouse models will be derived to model tumorigenesis in the aging lung.
Finally, we will probe the specific mechanism by which loss of epigenetic modifications, mediated by the
methyltransferase G9a, during aging contributes to increased tumor initiation through dysregulation of metabolic
genes and the metabolome. These studies will combine the strengths of two experienced PIs with expertise in
aging, metabolism, stem cell biology and cancer to generate new models of lung cancer and provide significant
insight into the synergy of two major hallmarks of aging in the most-deadly form of cancer."
11065578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer (PCa) in the
United States. Prostate multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can sensitively
detect prostate tumors by integrating anatomical and functional information. The current standardized scheme
for interpreting mpMRI is the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). However, detecting
cancerous lesions currently does not account for racially associated MRI characteristics in PI-RADS.
Our preliminary data showed a significant difference in detecting clinically significant PCa (csPCa) between AA
and CA men using PI-RADS when the tumors are in the transition zone (67% vs. 80%, respectively, p=0.026).
In addition, there was a distinctive difference in the PCa perfusion (that is, Ktrans) between AA and CA men, when
measured by quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (qDCE). When PI-RADS-based interpretation was
combined with the Ktrans threshold value specified for AA men, the csPCa detection rate in the transition zone in
AA men was improved to 76%, becoming not statistically different from that in CA men (p=0.180).
We developed a point-of-care portable perfusion phantom named P4 to improve the reproducibility of qDCE
measurement across different institutes. The P4-based error correction significantly reduced the variability in
qDCE measurement across three MRI scanners in two institutes and improved the specificity of Ktrans for csPCa
detection from 86% to 93%. We hypothesize that the racial disparity in PCa diagnosis can be reduced by using
racially associated qDCE measurement after P4-based error correction.
We propose to test this hypothesis in a multi-institutional setting at the University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Our team will collect and link clinical, radiologic,
and histopathologic information using patient-specific 3D-printed prostate molds, software registration, and
expert annotation before and after radical prostatectomy. The highly curated radiology-pathology dataset will be
used (1) to characterize the qDCE measurement associated with tumor microenvironment in AA and CA groups,
using co-localized quantitative radiology-pathology analyses after P4-based error correction, (2) to investigate
whether the racially associated MRI-based tissue characterization improves the detection of aggressive PCa,
and (3) to develop the race/ethnicity-specific deep learning model for the improved detection of aggressive PCa.
When the Aims are successfully accomplished, the improved detection of PCa in both AA and CA men is
anticipated, compared to conventional strategies, reducing the racial disparity in detecting aggressive PCa."
11080091,"Project Summary:
Sleep, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), is identified as a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease (AD), with evidence linking sleep disruptions to dementia and AD. Therapeutic trials for OSA show
potential cognitive benefits and alterations in brain regions. OSA is associated with inflammation, potentially
contributing to neurodegeneration. Socioenvironmental factors, such as neighborhood disadvantage, influence
cognitive decline and AD pathology. In OSA, neighborhood characteristics also impact severity. Disparities
exist in AD and OSA research, notably affecting Black women who are underrepresented and at heightened
risk of AD. Considering the increased susceptibility to AD observed among both Black individuals and women,
and recognizing their inadequate representation in AD research, it becomes crucial to investigate modifiable
risk factors for AD in Black women. The present study proposes to 1) Test the moderating influence of sleep
apnea on the relationship between inflammation and cognitive performance and p-Tau levels among Black
women, and 2) Determine if sleep apnea mediates the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic
disadvantage/neighborhood perceptions and cognition and p-Tau among Black women. Study visits will take
place at community sites in predominanUy Black neighborhoods in both LA and SD. There will be a baseline
visit and a follow-up visit 24 months after baseline (+/- 60 days). Baseline visits will include consent, blood
draw, cognitive testing, explanation and completion of questionnaires, and consent and instruction on both an
actigraphy device and home sleep test. Follow-up visits will involve re-consenting, blood draw, cognitive
testing, mood-related questionnaires, and home sleep tests. This project aims to extend the parent grant by
investigating the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on inflammation, tau, and cognitive function in Black
women. It will identify key OSA metrics influencing these relationships. Additionally, subjective measures of
neighborhood social cohesion and disorder will be integrated to complement objective assessments of
neighborhood disadvantage and explore their associations with OSA, tau, and cognitive function. The project
aligns with my learning and research goals, enhancing my expertise in sleep as an Alzheimer's disease risk
factor, collection, analysis, and interpretation of AD biomarkers, design and management of clinical research
using a community-based approach, and advanced training in longitudinal research design and related data
analytic methods. The obtained preliminary data will support future NIH 1<23 application, facilitating my growth
into an independent researcher."

We are pleased to submit this proposal in response to NOSI NOT-CA-24-030 - Administrative Supplements for
Contemporary Modifiable Exposures and Cancer Across the Cancer Control Continuum.
Microplastics (MPs), tiny plastic particles that enter the environment via the degradation of plastic waste and
industrial pollution, have become a ubiquitous environmental contaminant. The presence of MPs in the oceans,
drinking water, and food supply is increasingly well-documented. Accumulating evidence also demonstrates
the presence of MP contamination in human tissues and biospecimens, raising significant questions as to the
health implications of MP exposure and bioaccumulation. Given the ubiquity of MPs in different foods and in
beverages, it is plausible that the effects of MP exposure would be especially pronounced for diseases of the
colon and rectum, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Several suggested pathways link MP exposure to CRC
pathways. The presence of MPs has been implicated in triggering the production of reactive oxygen species,
inducing DNA damage and an inflammatory response. Chemical additives that leach out of MPs (i.e.,
leachates) could also contribute to CRC pathways directly or indirectly via impacts on the gut microbiome. The
objective of this proposal is to characterize the burden of MPs within the human gut, and to examine the
potential implications of this burden with respect to CRC. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will quantify and contrast
the burden of MPs in stool according to CRC history (1a) and in CRC tissue according to age at CRC
diagnosis (1b). This latter comparison is timely given that CRC incidence rates among individuals aged <50
years have been steadily increasing over the past 30 years – consistent with the timeline of growing MP
contamination. Our proposed Aim 2 allows a more mechanistic focus, where we will develop a system
integrating anaerobic microbial metabolism with CRC-derived organoids to examine the host response to toxic
polyvinylchloride MP leachates and to their microbial metabolites. Organoid cultures will be incubated with MP
leachates and with microbial-derived metabolites of those MP leachates to assess proliferation and apoptosis,
gene expression, and cancer-related pathways, yielding more detailed understanding as to the implications of
MPs on the gut microbiome and CRC pathways. Production and use of plastics has increased >230-fold since
1950, meaning that each passing generation will experience greater potential for MP bioaccumulation and
lifetime exposure. Given the pervasive and growing burden of MP contamination, it is critical we understand
the implications of MP exposure in human populations. Through the proposed aims, this project will
address a critical gap in knowledge as to the association of MP burden with CRC and will yield foundational
knowledge as to the direct and indirect effects of MP exposures."
11084319,"Disruption of the cortico-striatal network has been found in many human brain disorders, including Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, autism, schizophrenia, and major depression. Unfortunately, the cellular and
molecular deficits responsible for the development of disrupted connectivity in these disorders are very difficult
to study because of the limited access to primary human brain tissue and inability to recapitulate disease-related
network deficits in animal models. This is a major problem that prevents the discovery of novel therapies for
patients. Thus, the objectives of this study are to develop the first robust method for generating human cortico-
striatal organoids that recapitulate cortico-striatal connectivity and to use this system to investigate the cellular
and molecular mechanisms responsible for the establishment and maturation of human cortico-striatal networks.
To this end, we will use our new method to generate cortical and, for the first time, striatal organoids from human
stem cell-derived single neural rosettes (SNRs). In our preliminary experiments, we found that SNR-derived
cortical organoids consist of different subtypes of pallial neural progenitors, deep and superficial layer cortical
excitatory neurons, a small fraction of inhibitory neurons with lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE)-like identities,
astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, whereas SNR-derived striatal organoids are composed of different subtypes
of subpallial neural progenitors, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons, a large fraction of inhibitory neurons with LGE-
like identities, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that neurons in 5-month-old SNR-
derived organoids show functional and morphological evidence of maturity—firing repetitive action potentials,
receiving excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and exhibiting elaborate dendritic branches and spines. Our
specific aims in this study are (1) to develop a robust and reproducible protocol for assembling cortico-striatal
organoids with well-defined cell composition and organization; (2) to characterize the establishment of
anatomical and functional networks in human cortico-striatal organoids; and (3) to determine the molecular and
functional properties of the cortical and striatal neurons that make the connections. Importantly, we will use
“cutting-edge” techniques such as single-cell mRNA sequencing, chronically implanted multi-electrode probes,
rabies virus tracing, and optogenetics to investigate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. In
summary, this project will develop the first protocol for assembling functional human cortico-striatal networks and
provide novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of network connectivity. As most brain
disorders impact several brain regions and disrupt interregional brain communication, the ability to generate
organoids representing multiple brain regions that replicate the complex nervous system architecture and
physiology will constitute a major breakthrough in brain disease modeling and drug discovery."

Cell-based immunotherapy such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T and CAR-natural
killer (NK) cells have shown tremendous successes in hematomalignancies. However, it
has had limited positive outcomes in the treatment of solid tumors. For effective killing of
tumor cells, immune cells must be physically engaged with the tumor cells and form an
immunological synapse. In solid tumors, a main challenge is for the immune cells to
infiltrate to the tumor core and to physically surround each tumor cells. Here, we
hypothesize that mechanical stresses within the target tumor critically regulate the
immune cell infiltration into the tumor core, as well as their ability to form immunological
synapse with tumor cells. As such, mechanical stresses can be utilized to improve
immune cells’ ability to kill tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following
specific aims. Aim 1: We will determine roles of mechanical forces in regulating infiltration
of natural killer cells into the tumor spheroid core. Aim 2: We will determine roles of
mechanical compression in potentiating tumor spheroids for effective immune killing. We
will use a 3D microfluidic compression device developed under parent grant to control
mechanical stresses within the tumor spheroids. Natural killer cells and breast tumor
spheroids embedded within a collagen matrix will be used to recreate the 3D tumor
microenvironment. The proposed project extends the current mechano-immune
regulation assay from a 2D to 3D platform. The delivery of this research project will be a
set of mechanical conditions, extracellular matrix architecture, compression rate and
frequencies for effective tumor killing. These results can be used to guide future CAR-
NK cell based immunotherapies for the treatment of solid tumors. An equally important
component of this project is to provide a training opportunity for a first year URM graduate
student to set a solid foundation for a PhD thesis program, and also to enable her to reach
a personal goal of supporting the educational advancement of underrepresented
communities."
11061139,"PARENT AWARD R35GM118027 ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this Maximizing Investigator’s Research award renewal application is to understand the
integration of complex signaling networks at both the single cell and multi-cellular level during wound healing.
Despite progress in understanding the signals that guide wound repair, there remains a significant gap in
understanding how different types of cells communicate to integrate a wound healing response. This gap limits
our ability to design new therapeutic strategies for a broad range of human disease including diabetes, cancer,
cardiovascular disease and autoimmunity. The overall focus of our research is to understand the basic
molecular mechanisms that regulate cell migration and how defects in cell migration contribute to
human disease in the context of tissue damage and repair. The optical transparency and ease of genetic
manipulation make zebrafish an ideal model system to dissect multi-cellular and tissue interactions during wound
repair. During the prior funding period, we invested significant effort in developing new tools for imaging and
manipulating cell dynamics, cell guidance cues, metabolism and matrix remodeling during wound healing in both
simple and complex wound models. We performed large-scale TRAP (translating ribosomal affinity purification)-
RNAseq and identified context- and cell-type specific gene expression changes. Using genome editing we are
now poised to uncover new signaling mechanisms and guidance cues that regulate neutrophil reverse migration
and inflammation resolution, and influence matrix remodeling during wound healing. Understanding how
wound repair is orchestrated and integrated at both the single cell and multi-cellular level, including the
role of microbial interactions, in the different types of tissue damage is the focus of our future research.
The overall goal of our work is to identify key signaling networks and guidance cues that mediate cell migration
during wound repair, dissect how they are altered in pathological conditions and ultimately may be targeted to
understand and treat human disease."

Medically tailored groceries (MTG) generally involve fresh and shelf-stable grocery items to be
prepared at home, selected by a nutritional professional based on a treatment plan and are typically
picked up at a clinic, market, or pantry. This clinic-based market or pantry model (CB-MTG) is a
growing approach adopted by health care systems in their effort to address food insecurity in their
patient population, including University Hospitals of Cleveland (UH) and MetroHealth Medical
Center (Metro), two of the three largest health systems in Cleveland, Ohio. Often offered to patients
with food-related chronic conditions, CB-MTGs have shown to improve medication adherence,
increase fruits and vegetable consumption and decrease HbA1c in people with diabetes. However,
less evidence is available on the impact of CB-MTGs with food insecure pregnant individuals, where
food insecurity has been strongly associated with prematurity and other negative birth outcomes.
While promising, the CB-MTG approach requires transportation, having the tools and equipment to
prepare meals at home and some basic food preparation skills, all potential barriers for low-income
pregnant individuals, especially younger parents-to-be or those already with children. The Greater
Cleveland Food Bank and partners, seeking to address these barriers, recently developed a home
delivered version of MTG (HD-MTG), offered to Medicaid-eligible pregnant individuals across the
county, with promising results. We seek to integrate these approaches into patient care for food
insecure, pregnant women and test the effectiveness of these two approaches, alongside an
additional intervention arm that adds supplemental nutrition and culinary education and support
to the home-delivered approach (HD-MTG PLUS). These three approaches will be offered (via
randomization) to 360 pregnant individuals (120 per arm) with food insecurity who are patients
within UH and Metro’s largest urban obstetric practices, each with direct EHR referral systems to
their “food as medicine” clinics/markets. Data are collected at baseline, near/at delivery and 6
months post-delivery. This study seeks to understand the unique contribution of each approach, as
well as implementation and intervention uptake barriers, with the goal of building the evidence
base of MTG interventions and making recommendations to providers and health systems seeking
to address food insecurity and nutrient de�iciencies during pregnancy."

Depression and anxiety are highly comorbid and costly diseases. Evidence-based psychotherapy is the first-line
treatment but is underutilized and not scalable. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), delivered via the
internet and/or mobile apps, have evolved as efficacious and potentially scalable treatments. To date, however,
effectiveness in routine care is limited by insufficient patient engagement. In order to achieve the transformative
potential of DMHIs, we must identify strategies to keep patients engaged without adding human support in a
form that would limit scalability. Automated motivational push messaging (AMM) and light-touch human coach
support (CS) offer two such strategies. The proposed research tests these strategies, while drawing preliminary
conclusions about a hypothesized model of DMHI engagement based on the technology adoption and treatment
adherence literature. The model posits that two systems-level constructs (social influence and facilitating
conditions) and three patient-level constructs (attitude, self-efficacy, habit strength) drive DMHI engagement. In
Study 1 (N=20), I will employ user-centered design to develop and refine a set AMMs targeting the three
hypothesized patient-level engagement-driving constructs (Aim 1). In Study 2, I will recruit N=76 primary care
patients with depression and/or anxiety via provider referral to an 8-week 2x2 factorial clinical trial whereby
participants will all receive access to a DMHI with known efficacy and be randomized to an engagement strategy
condition (i.e., a previously-validated CS protocol, newly-developed AMM, both or neither). To further understand
how AMMs function, message delivery in the AMM arms will be micro-randomized: each day participants will be
randomized to receive a message or not, such that they receive an average of 4.2 messages/week.
Microrandomization allows causal inference about the near-term impact of message delivery (i.e., are AMMs a
cue to action) and the relationship between message impact and context (e.g., time of day the message is
delivered). Measured outcome data will comprise level of engagement (operationalized as minutes of DMHI
use), weekly self-reports on the five engagement-driving constructs, and weekly self-reports of clinical outcomes.
I will test impacts of each strategy on measured outcome data (Aim 2) and explore the hypothesized relationships
between engagement-driving constructs and DMHI engagement (Aim 3). Clinical outcomes will be assessed,
however, consistent with the experimental therapeutics model, this research leverages a DMHI with known
efficacy, allowing the focus to be an upstream target (patient engagement) rather than the clinical outcomes
themselves. The overarching goal is to influence the target so as to ultimately enhance clinical effectiveness.
This project will build my expertise in clinical trial design and build my proficiency in user-centered design (i.e.,
rapid, prototype testing via field studies) and data science (i.e., analysis of intensive, correlated longitudinal data)
methods commonly applied in DMHI optimization research. Findings will lay a foundation for R01s aimed at
optimizing DMHIs for engagement, and ultimately effectiveness, when integrated into routine care."

The goal of this Mentored Career Development Award is to prepare Dr. Lauren Gerlach for a career as an
independent investigator focused on measuring and improving the quality of end-of-life care for older adults
with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Behavioral symptoms in advanced dementia are common, and
despite limited evidence to support their use, the mainstay of such symptom management in hospice is off-
label use of psychotropic medications such as antipsychotics. However, recent clinical trial evidence suggests
that use of antipsychotics at end of life may be associated with worse outcomes for patients—raising concerns
that the very medications prescribed to alleviate distress in fact exacerbate it. Little is known about how widely
psychotropics are prescribed during end-of-life care for dementia, the factors that influence this prescribing, or
the outcomes of such use. These critical knowledge gaps—including which patients are at greatest risk of
potential harm—limit the ability to develop a consensus on best practices to address distressing behavioral
symptoms in hospice care for dementia. Dr. Gerlach’s clinical training as a geriatric psychiatrist and prior
research in pharmacoepidemiology provide the critical foundation for this work, but her transition to
independence requires new skills and knowledge that will be gained through a coordinated program of
research, mentorship, and coursework during the 5-year award period. This will include training in: 1) hospice-
based dementia care, 2) use of Medicare and Minimum Data Set (MDS) data to examine end-of-life care, 3)
advanced statistical methods for pharmacoepidemiology research, and 4) qualitative research methods. The
proposed study will use Medicare data for all older adults with dementia enrolled in hospice in 2015 to
determine the array of patient, provider, and hospice characteristics that influence psychotropic prescribing
(Aim 1). In partnership with a local hospice organization, an exploratory sub-aim will examine the indications
for psychotropic prescribing at end of life—information not available in claims data. Aim 2 will use linked
Medicare and MDS data to examine outcomes associated with psychotropic prescribing (e.g., functional
impairment, behavioral symptoms, mortality). Finally, Aim 3 will include interviews with patients with early-
stage dementia, caregivers, and hospice providers to elicit stakeholder perspectives on the goals of hospice
care. Study findings will inform how to best manage behavioral symptoms at the end of life. Given that not all
patients with dementia utilize hospice, this K23 is designed to lay the foundation for a subsequent R01 to
examine broader end-of-life care among all patients with dementia and to determine how hospice enrollment
impacts outcomes. The R01 study will use Medicare and linked survey data to determine factors that impact
the care patients receive in the last year of life and to identify the extent of potentially inappropriate treatments
and impact on caregiver outcomes to better inform hospice care models for dementia."
11063400,"ABSTRACT FOR THE PARENT GRANT
 Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (ATAA) is a major cardiovascular health problem characterized by
a dilated aorta that may eventually dissect or rupture. ATAA presents a serious challenge in that the surgery is
difficult and dangerous, so aneurysm repair criteria must balance the risk of a dissection and/or rupture with
the risk of surgery. Current surgical guidelines are based on ATAA diameter or growth rate, but up to 60% of
patients with an ATAA experience a dissection before surgical criteria are reached, hence there is a clear need
for additional biomarkers of aneurysm failure. Possible biomarkers fall into broad categories including genetic,
microstructural, geometrical, and biofluids, but it is challenging to obtain enough human data to calculate and
correlate these biomarkers with critical outcomes such as failure. It is likely that a single biomarker is not
sufficient, but composite biomarkers that are not intuitively obvious may be necessary for significant predictions
of patient outcomes. In this proposal we will use a combination of models: 1) a mouse model of ATAA
associated with Marfan Syndrome, 2) a multiscale, multiphysics model of ATAA growth and remodeling, and 3)
virtual patient models derived from real patient imaging data, to determine composite biomarkers that may
predict ATAA growth, progression, and failure. Our first Specific Aim is to use a genetic mouse model of ATAA
associated with Marfan Syndrome to characterize aneurysm progression and failure in previously unachieved
detail, quantifying aortic shape, tissue composition, tissue mechanical properties, and hemodynamics over
time. This level of detail is not possible in human patients and is necessary to validate and test hypotheses on
the growth and remodeling rules in our multiscale, multiphysics model in Specific Aim 2 and to provide an initial
set of biomarkers to evaluate for our virtual patients in Specific Aim 3. Our second Specific Aim is to develop a
novel multiscale, multiphysics computational model of ATAA growth and remodeling to produce results that will
be compared to the mouse data in Specific Aim 1 and used to predict remodeling progression in real and
virtual human patients in Specific Aim 3. In our third Specific Aim, we will use available human ATAA scans
from Marfan Syndrome patients to generate a statistical shape model basis for the ATAA geometry, and we will
use that basis to generate virtual patients, whose TAA course throughout progression and failure will be
created by the model in Specific Aim 2, with parameters determined from published literature and our mouse
data in Specific Aim 1. Both real and virtual patient data will then be used to train a machine learning tool to
relate the composite biomarkers to the remodeling outcomes and predict failure risk. This plan synthesizes
multiple recent advances and supplements them with new ideas to produce a computer system capable of
making useful failure predictions for ATAA.
ABSTRACT FOR THE SUPPLEMENT
 The supplement will provide funding for Luis Castro to advance his research training, contribute to his
career development, and enhance the outcomes of the parent grant. The proposed supplement research will
include new analyses of mouse aorta to obtain additional information on tissue composition and microstructure
during ATAA formation, remodeling, and failure for Specific Aim 1. Similar analyses of composition and
microstructure for human aorta samples available through a surgical biobank will be included in the
supplement research to help translate the data in the mouse to the multiscale multiphysics model of ATAA
growth and remodeling in human patients for Specific Aim 2. The supplement research will also apply machine
learning to speed up and facilitate model generation from human ATAA imaging data for Specific Aim 3. The
supplement research projects are logical extension of the parent grant that will increase the significance of the
parent grant outcomes, while remaining within the scope of the parent grant."

The NIH Common Fund has currently funded somatic cell gene editing projects through the Somatic Cell Gene
Editing (SCGE) consortium, with the goal of translating gene editing into the clinic. At the December 2023
consortium kick-off, there were significant discussions about how the basic science grants could work towards a
health equity focus so that as projects reach the clinical trials phase, they are well positioned to ensure that the
ultimate translation of gene editing happens in a more equitable manner. The current proposal is a 1-year
administrative bioethics supplement to a U19 grant “The CRISPR Vision Program: Nonviral Genome Editing
Platforms to Treat Inherited Retinal Channelopathies” (PI K. Saha, University of Wisconsin-Madison) and will be
conducted jointly between investigators at ETH-Zurich and the Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison. The proposal will
both address bioethics capacity within the SCGE consortium and provide empiric data to address the specific
ethical issues of health equity and justice in somatic cell gene editing for inherited retinal disorders (IRDs). We
propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will perform a normative review of the health equity and justice issues
for somatic gene editing therapies. This aim will increase bioethics capacity in the SCGE by providing a
framework for future work within the consortium, and will also serve as a foundation for the empirical work in Aim
2. In Aim 2, we will identify the ethical attitudes of patients/family members who have lived experience
of retinal disease towards somatic gene editing, with a particular eye towards health equity and justice
issues. This empiric bioethics project will include up to 30 interviews (in English or Spanish) with persons who
have a lived experience of IRDs. Topics covered in these interviews will include participant views towards (1)
SCGE for IRDs and more broadly, (2) personal values, (3) individual and societal impacts of SCGE for visual
impairments, (4) clinical endpoints, (5) consideration of potential risk and benefit across the translational pathway
(clinical trials, early clinical availability), (6) information that they feel would be critical in order to provide informed
consent for a future clinical trial or clinical administration of genome editing for IRD. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
integrate the experiences of Aim 1 and 2 to construct guidance for the other SCGE grantees that will help
them consider the potential approaches toward community engagement and health equity in their future work."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The rapid increase in popularity of dual use of flavored little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) with cigarettes among
U.S. young adults has significant implications for their health, addiction, and cessation. LCCs are used for two
primary reasons: their relatively lower cost and flavor offerings. As cigarettes become more expensive or less
reinforcing, young adults may substitute with attractively flavored LCCs rather than quit. We do not know the
addictiveness of LCCs compared with cigarettes in dual users, the role that flavors play in addiction and dual
use, and if flavors are more important for women than men. Moreover, the FDA has described research on
cigars and flavors as a priority. Therefore, a critical need exists to characterize the addiction potential (AP) of
flavored and unflavored LCCs compared with cigarettes and differences by sex in dual users.
 The specific aims are to: (1) characterize the AP of LCCs compared with cigarettes; (2) determine the
extent to which the AP of LCCs varies by flavor and sex of user; and (3) determine the extent to which LCC
use in the home environment differs by flavored vs. unflavored. The proposed study will employ a 3-week
crossover design that combines survey-based measures (including behavioral economic assessments),
biomarkers, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of AP, dependence, and tobacco use behaviors
among 145 non-treatment-seeking young adult (18-34 years old) dual users. AP will be characterized by
behavioral economic indices of demand, such as the hypothetical consumption of LCCs at escalating prices,
and other standardized measures of addiction. The impact of flavors on LCC and cigarette smoking at home
will be captured by EMA. This information will address the following FDA priorities: impact of changes in LCC
flavors on dependence and dual use behaviors, and innovative methods to assess tobacco use behaviors.
 The career development plan combines mentored hands-on training with coursework and professional
development activities to meet the objectives critical to my transition to independent tobacco regulatory
scientist. My career goal is to conduct research that develops our understanding of tobacco use in vulnerable
populations, and informs tobacco regulation to reduce disease. I propose additional training in addictions
research (including clinical trials), measurement of dependence and addiction potential, cigar regulatory
research, and grantsmanship. With this training and my prior experience, I will be able to transition to an
independent investigator of tobacco product flavorings and other characteristics that—with cognitive, affective,
behavioral, and environmental influences—contribute to their uptake, use, and addiction. UConn Health,
Brown, and Rutgers provide excellent resources for my career development, including formal coursework,
seminars, expert faculty, research centers, office space, equipment, software, and data collection, analysis,
and management resources. The focused training provided by this Award represents the final step in my
career development and provides preliminary data and training for planned R-level grant writing.

11085761,"The goal of the CCII COBRE is to establish a thematic multidisciplinary research center of excellence at the 
University of Louisville that focuses on improving our understanding of cancer immunology and developing 
novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Importantly, with the recent clinical successes of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors and oncolytic viruses, there is great interest and momentum in understanding the interaction between 
the host immune system and neoplastic cells. Our projects proposing basic immunology research coupled with 
translational and human specimen studies are expected to ultimately lead to entirely new immunotherapeutic 
approaches, as well as strategies for overcoming resistance to existing agents. The Administrative Core (AC) 
will coordinate the professional activities of the more than 40 individuals who will constitute the new Center for 
Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CCII). The AC will provide administrative, fiscal, and scientific 
oversight and planning for junior investigators, mentors, projects, the research core, a pilot program, and 
advisory committees. In addition to governance functions, the AC will provide key research and mentoring 
support. This will include the awarding of project grants, assignment of mentors, provision of a grant writing 
mentorship program, biostatistics and bioinformatics support, compliance and regulatory oversight, mentoring 
of pilot projects, and encouragement of diversity and inclusion. Internal advisors and an External Advisory 
Committee (EAC) that consists of five leading scientists in the CCII thematic area will guide the AC. The EAC 
will provide scientific guidance and constructive feedback regarding center/project progress and be involved in 
CCII strategic planning and in the selection of replacement and pilot projects. The two PIs of the overall CCII 
program will direct the AC with key support from two co-Is who have extensive experience administering multi- 
component grant programs and from two additional co-Is who are well qualified to oversee the essential 
biostatistics and bioinformatics support. Their efforts will supplement a mentoring program that is anchored by 
eight senior investigators who are experienced mentors and have been highly productive and well funded in 
the thematic area. The three specific aims of this Administrative Core that encompass all of these functions are 
to: (1) Establish procedures for CCII administration, planning, and decision-making; (2) Provide a mentorship 
program to accelerate the careers of the CCII junior investigators; and (3) Create a CCII pilot grant program 
that will stimulate new projects and collaborations. Innovative features of the AC are built on lessons learned 
from establishing other multidisciplinary thematic centers and include a shared governance approach that aims 
to ensure engagement of all participants and a holistic mentoring strategy that provides comprehensive 
guidance for our CCII junior investigators. By the end of the 5-year funding program, we expect that 4-6 CCII 
junior investigators will have been awarded R01 grants and that many of these graduates will remain key 
members of this new COBRE focused on cancer immunology and immunotherapy."
11073551,"Project Summary
The new Multi-ethnic Observational Study in American Asian and Pacific Islander Communities (MOSAAIC)
cohort represents a pioneering longitudinal study designed to make substantial contributions to our
understanding of the health and health disparities within populations of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
Oceanic ancestry. The overall objective of this study is to establish an epidemiologic cohort comprising a
minimum of 10,000 individuals aged 18-64, residing in the United States, who have Native Hawaiian ancestry
or affiliations with Asian nations (East, Southeast, or South) or Pacific Islands in their family heritage or place
of birth, and to examine the prevalence and incidence of cardiometabolic and mental health conditions and
their associated risk factors.
Within the first 6 months of initiation, the investigators have developed a functioning organizational structure
and through this, have drafted a core protocol. The key features of this protocol include a baseline survey
covering a broad range of topics, a brief physical exam (anthropometry, ECG, and spirometry) and
biospecimen collection (saliva, blood, urine, and stool). Follow-up at 6 months,12 months, and annually
thereafter will include health updates and additional exposure assessments. Selected health outcomes (e.g.,
myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) will be documented and adjudicated. To accommodate changes in
NHLBI requirements (expansion of age eligibility and country of origin groups), address gaps in the
understanding of protocol requirements, and the interests of the investigators in enhancing critical data, we
propose to: 1) Enhance participant recruitment and retention strategies with additional participant
recruitment and materials in official study languages and capitation payments associated with completed
follow-up contacts to assist with staffing costs of follow-up and medical record collection and to provide an
associated participant incentive; and to 2) Improve the quality and scientific rigor of study data, clinical
measures, and biospecimens though more in depth assessments (a second spirometry following
bronchodilation and linkage of culturally adapted nutritional assessments with nutrient databases), additional
standardization of ECG equipment and biospecimen supplies, the feasibility study of PBMC collection, and the
incorporation of a baseline repeatability study to assess the reliability of our novel data collection items. These
enhancements to the core study will strengthen the overall cohort and the inference that can be drawn from it."

The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) awardee, the University of Arizona (UArizona)-Banner 
Health, has established a productive and beneficent consortium to generate well-engaged 
demographically and geographically diverse participation based on our Precision Engagement and 
Participant Journey models. Our successes include enrolling 68,500+ core participants across 
Arizona and Colorado of whom 84% represent at least one of the communities historically
underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR). High UBR engagement and enrollment has set 
the cadence for continual forward momentum. Our team achieves innumerable wins via sustained, 
reliable participant outreach and protocol execution. As part of these diverse communities, the 
UArizona-Banner Health AoURP staff develop person-first, culturally and age-appropriate 
strategies to engage, enroll, and retain participants and partner with community-based 
organizations. Our improved retention rates are another success—currently at 38% active and an 
impressive 92% passive retention rates. 
The UArizona-Banner Health consortium has enrolled one of every four Hispanic, Latino, or 
Spanish participants in the national AoURP. From this foundation, we will evolve and innovate
over the next five-year cycle and continue to reach UBR communities over a disparate geography. 
The UArizona-Banner Health consortium recognizes the importance of pivoting to reach UBR 
communities with distinct challenges, such as rural areas with low technology literacy and
communities who experience generational mistrust in health research. Responding to these 
challenges and meeting such concerns is our ethos, which we call nuestro poder or our power. 
Accordingly, we propose to expand into Banner Health facilities and build effective partnerships 
for the UArizona-Banner Health Mountain Consortium in Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, 
Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico. UArizona-Banner Health will function as a 
coordinating center in the Southwestern and Western U.S. to engage, enroll, and retain participants 
who reflect demographic vibrancy nationwide. By leveraging best practices and lessons learned in
the initial five-year award, we will export our multipronged models to key partners in this wider 
region. In the new funding cycle, we will continue site activities, uphold AoU values, meet the 
regional expansion challenges, and sustain momentum. We will extend our reach by including new 
participants from pediatrics, 65+ communities, and rural areas, while we maintain the high quality 
of participant engagement, retention, and an overall UBR proportion >80%. Four specific aims 
will address Area of Interest 1, Tasks 1–5: 1. Implement a comprehensive engagement program 
that forms meaningful, lasting relationships with community-specific partners and individual 
participants, focusing on those from UBR backgrounds; 2. Contribute to the breadth and depth of 
the AoURP dataset by enrolling 11,300 participants in Year 1, and 60,000 diverse participants over 
five years, in new and existing geographies, eliminating technology access disparities to make 
AoURP accessible to anyone, anywhere; 3. Establish a relational and inclusive value-based 
approach to retention so that participants across UBR groups continue to provide high-quality data, 
increasing active retention to 40% and maintaining passive retention of 90%; and 4. Launch 
specialized engagement directed toward building awareness regarding AoURP pediatric 
enrollment, and following a successful 2023 micro-launch, include recruitment and retention to 
eligible prospective pediatric participants with their families as part of UArizona-Banner Health. 
The UArizona-Banner Health AoURP team will assess activity impacts, disseminate promising 
practices to the broader AoURP network, evaluate our initiatives against AoURP objectives and 
quality standards, and ensure our approach moves AoURP toward a more inclusive and equitable 
community, participant, and provider engagement, enrollment, and retention. We will continue to 
exceed these goals and maintain our excellence for the AoURP."

The Coast-to-Coast Consortium (C2C)
proposes Strong UBR Recruitment, Retention,
and Facilitation through innovation (SURRF).
C2C combines experienced and new sites to
provide innovative and committed support to
NIH goals for (1) strong underrepresented in
biomedical research (UBR) enrollment, retention, and engagement; (2) use of implementation
science best practices; and (3) increase return of value to participants. Our use of implementation
science will improve data-driven decision making, and establish the right balance between costs
per participant and successful recruitment and retention of UBR participants. Our institutions
(Table 2.1) will recruit a total of 68,222, with 80% UBR (Table 2.2). This will be accomplished
through new outreach and partnerships that take advantage of our extensive catchment areas.
Within >80% overall UBR representation, we expect >50% based on race/ethnicity, and >20%
on low-income. We will increase UBR community-based partnerships by at least 20%, and we
will have >60% retention by Year 5.
Five of our institutions are founding members of the All of Us Research
Program (AoU) California Precision Medicine Consortium (CAPMC),
which has met or exceeded its milestones for recruitment, retention,
including UBRs, for the past six years. The new sites were chosen because
they complement existing sites not only with highly diverse populations, but
also diversification in institution types and locations: RIQI, a Health
Information Exchange (HIE) covering the whole state of Rhode Island;
PRCCI, a research institute with sites all over Puerto Rico; and Yale, a research university in the
state of Connecticut. An HIE will allow us to understand the efficacy of shifting the existing
model of having healthcare provider organizations (HPOs) recruit from their sites, to having the
hub of a network of organizations select among any of its contributing sites, allowing to focus on
sites enriched for UBRs. PRCCI is a consortium of clinical research sites in Puerto Rico, where
74% of the population is UBR. The population covered by Yale New Haven Health reflects the
contrasts of Connecticut, which has the highest per capita income in the country, but where 25%
of the population lives in poverty. Of the four new institutions, three have begun already started
recruiting via supplements to CAPMC (Yale and PRCCI) or via the AoU Nutrition for Precision
Health study (UCLA).
Our multidisciplinary team has a strong track record of collaborative research, which facilitates
working together successfully. Contact PI Lucila Ohno-Machado has been the contact PI for
CAPMC, and she has more than 25 years of experience serving as PI/program director (PI/PD)
for NIH research/training grants and service contracts. Dr. Ohno-Machado has deep working
relationships with each PI and provides an inclusive, collaborative environment. Our multi-PI
team has a combination of leaders in their fields and emerging leaders, and itself represents the
diversity we strive to recruit and retain. Of 11 MPIs, only four are male; various racial and ethnic
groups are represented; there are MDs, MD/PhDs, and PhDs in various areas. Our staff are
equally diverse and reflect the communities we serve. We have established partnerships and will
continue to collaborate with the San Diego Blood Bank (also in the AoU Direct Volunteer
Program), various Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC), as well as multiple
community partners. We share lessons learned and value the privilege of being part of AoU."

11061654,"The goal of this project in the Tulane COBRE for Sex-based Precision Medicine is to develop microphysiological systems (MPS) for modeling sex-specific pathophysiology. MPS models of human disease created with a sex-based approach will increase the relevance of mechanistic investigations and enhance the predictive accuracy of therapeutic screenings. There are currently no reports that systematically compare sex-matched and cross-sex hormone stimulation in cultured human cells. Sex-matched culture systems match the chromosomal composition of cells with known physiological hormone environments (e.g., XX cells in an estrogen-dominant environment). Cross-sex culture systems are those in which the hormone environment matches the opposite sex (e.g., XY cells in an estrogendominant environment). Focusing on cell-based models of the outer retinal microvasculature, we will first combine 2D and 3D culture assays to define the sex-specific effects of estrogen and androgen on bioenergetic capacity, vasculogenic capacity, and transcriptomic profiles determined by single cell RNA sequencing. These analyses will determine optimal hormone concentrations for quantifying the response to proinflammatory or proangiogenic stimuli in sex-matched and cross-sex MPS models of endothelial barrier function and sprouting angiogenesis. Inflammatory perturbation of endothelial barrier function and pathological neovascularization are core elements of microvascular pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy. We will use our validated MPS models of vascular permeability and angiogenesis in the outer retinal microvasculature as venues for exploring the broad hypothesis that there are sex-specific mechanisms in diabetic retinopathy. Sex-matched MPS models of the retinal microvasculature will provide novel insights regarding hormonal regulation of cytokine-induced vascular permeability and VEGF-driven sprouting angiogenesis. Cross-sex MPS models of the same processes will provide critical and currently non-existent insights regarding gender-affirming hormone therapy in the cardiovascular system. Transcriptomic signatures of sex-matched and cross-sex hormone stimulation in 2D and 3D cell cultures will be referenced to infer potential mechanisms of action in the MPS assays. We will identify candidate biomarkers to inform further research of sex- and gender-based treatments for diabetic retinopathy. Collectively, this research will deliver adaptable sex-specific human cell culture systems and methods."
11062912,"ABSTRACT
Persistently impoverished neighborhoods face ongoing disinvestment, leading to significant
social, environmental, and structural hurdles that impact the health outcomes of their
inhabitants. The persistent poverty in these areas presents obstacles to effective cancer
prevention efforts, stemming from intricate and interconnected factors that hinder prevention at
the personal, healthcare system, and societal levels. Enhancing cancer outcomes in these
regions necessitates innovative, cross-sectoral approaches addressing root causes and social
determinants of health. It requires collaborative research and policymaking endeavors that
involve the affected communities in co-creating solutions.
Our supplementary proposal aims to increase the involvement of the Hmong ethnic minority in
cancer-preventive screenings and broader cancer prevention efforts. This aligns with the
primary focus of the main grant but complements it as there are few projects targeting this
specific community. We seek to boost awareness and knowledge regarding cancer prevention
among Hmong communities in California, particularly those facing persistent poverty, while
encouraging their participation in early detection screenings. We will engage in community
outreach by actively participating in local health fairs and other community events. Additionally,
we will conduct a population assessment to identify any correlations between key social needs
and colorectal cancer prevention measures. In line with the main grant's objectives, our focus
will be on assessing the extent to which basic needs, such as income and access to health-
improving resources like food, transportation, and housing, are met. Furthermore, we plan to
utilize California cancer registries as secondary sources to examine Hmong colorectal cancer
outcomes, particularly in areas marked by persistent poverty."
11063045,"Project Summary
This is a request for a supplement to R01 CA279585 to train Ms. Andrea Valdespino, a highly talented
graduate student from the University of Pennsylvania to train with Dr. Maureen Murphy at the Wistar
Institute. The overarching goal of the parent R01 is to identify and test a gene expression signature for
genetic variants of TP53; this goal followed from our recent publication that identified a 143-gene
expression signature that accurately predicts whether heterozygous B cells contain a p53 hypomorph (a
lesser functioning genetic variant) versus wild type (WT) p53 or a benign (fully functional) variant. This
goal is critical to the 4.5 million people in the United States that are heterozygous for a lesser-functioning
“hypomorphic” p53 allele, but who are currently categorized as a “variant of uncertain significance (VUS)”.
As a VUS carrier, these individuals are uninformed as to cancer risk and they do not qualify for MRI
screening for cancer. Ms. Valdespino has obtained very new data indicating that the interferon signaling
pathway (IFN) is significantly upregulated in cells from p53 hypomorphs compared to WT sibling controls.
The two aims of the proposed research will: 1) identify the mechanism underlying increased IFN signaling
in hypomorph B cells, with focus on the dsRNA/TLR3 pathway and the mitochondrial/dsDNA pathway, and
2) test the other thirty cell lines in the laboratory from hypomorph carriers, compared to WT controls, for
activation of IFN signaling. The hope is to determine whether including an activated IFN signaling pathway
in our analysis improves the identification of individuals with an impaired p53 pathway. Such an outcome
would allow for improved assessment of cancer risk in carriers with genetic variants of p53."
11064481,"The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and other disorders (ADRDs) represents a public health crisis. In the
absence of effective medical treatment, there is a critical need for behavioral interventions to prevent or delay
symptom onset. Multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting multiple modifiable risks for ADRD have
shown promise. Additional innovative approaches that capitalize on senior-friendly digital applications to
support and strengthen behavior modification and enhance intervention scalability are needed. Training in the
use of compensatory aids (e.g., calendars and note taking systems) can improve daily independence. These
same compensatory tools can be employed to facilitate the adoption of lifestyle changes that support brain
health (e.g., exercise, cognitive engagement, stress management) through management of goal-setting,
behavioral monitoring, tracking and feedback. The current project will test a 6-month intervention that
provides training in both compensatory aids and lifestyle modification. A comprehensive suite of digital tools
encapsulated in the Digital Memory Notebook (DMN), an easy to use, interactive application, will be used to
facilitate behavioral change and enhance participant motivation. Further, the DMN allows collection of real-
time data to track intervention adherence. The DMN has been successfully applied to improving compensation
among individuals with mild cognitive impairment. The proposed work capitalizes on a critical window for
building resilience by targeting individuals at risk for ADRD due to a subjective cognitive concern (SCC) but
who remain cognitively normal. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among ethnoracially
diverse older adults with SCC to compare our digital application supported compensation training and lifestyle
modification intervention to an education only control group that will not use the DMN or be provided with
guidance on how to implement the educational material into their daily lives. Specific aims of the project
include: 1) evaluate intervention efficacy on primary outcomes (global cognition and everyday function);
secondary outcomes focus on well-being, cognitive domains (memory and executive function), activities of
daily living (IADLs), physical function, compensation, and health behaviors; 2) evaluate characteristics of
treatment responders; 3) evaluate adherence and identify the effective components of the target intervention
using a mixed-method approach; and 4) design machine learning algorithms that use patterns of change in
real-time DMN data metrics to identify incipient declines in treatment adherence and changes in health status.
The intervention under study is novel because it applies training in compensation to support lifestyle
modifications and everyday functioning using a digital application that also monitors adherence to each
component of the intervention in real-time. The project is expected to expand understanding of factors that
may impact adherence to and outcomes of a preventative intervention leading to optimization of a scalable
intervention to reduce dementia risk applicable to diverse populations."

This is a supplemental application under NOT-OD-24-031 to conduct bioethics research related to inclusion
of pregnant people in tuberculosis clinical trials. Women bear a large proportion of the global tuberculosis
burden, and 250,000 pregnant women develop tuberculosis annually. Millions more pregnant people need
tuberculosis preventive therapy and/or vaccines. Despite this, almost all clinical trials of new tuberculosis
therapeutics and vaccines have excluded pregnant people from participating, resulting in a lack of evidence to
inform clinical guidelines and practice. Over the past year, our team at the Johns Hopkins TB Research
Advancement Center, working under the aegis of the USAID-funded SMART4TB Consortium, has led an
initiative to increase access for pregnant people to TB clinical trials. In collaboration with the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the IMPAACT Network, we sponsored a global consensus meeting in October 2023
to research equity for pregnant people. Over the coming year we are working with the WHO and other
partners to gain stakeholder input and develop guidance documents for inclusion of pregnant people in
research. In this supplemental application to our TRAC, we request support to conduct outreach to clinical
trialists and clinicians to identify barriers to inclusion of pregnant people in TB trials. Input from other
stakeholders is being collected by the WHO, SMART4TB, and advocacy groups. We propose to conduct in-
depth interviews with key informants from the TB research and treatment community to identify the most
important barriers to inclusion of pregnant people in trials, then use the themes that emerge to design and
implement a larger stakeholder survey for up to 300 clinicians and triallists. We will employ methods previously
used in the PHASES Project, which addressed a lack of equity for women in HIV research. Our research team
includes experts in clinical trials, bioethics, TB in women, survey research, and community advocacy. The
results of this work will support development of global guidance by the WHO, research networks, and funders."

 Patients with early and locally advanced breast cancer (ELABC) are treated with a combination of pre-
operative (neoadjuvant) therapy, surgical resection and post-operative (adjuvant) therapy. In recent years,
overall survival for ELABC has improved to ~90% at 5 years. However, to achieve this goal, patients are often
over-treated due to lack of effective biomarkers. For example, a majority of patients who receive adjuvant
therapy are already cured after surgery and derive no further benefit. Similarly, almost a third of patients
treated with neoadjuvant therapy are found to have pathological Complete Response upon surgery (no
evidence of tumor upon histopathology), suggesting that the surgery could have been safely omitted. An
effective biomarker for minimal residual disease (MRD) can help personalize treatment plans and reduce over-
treatment, while preserving outcomes in patients with breast cancer.
 Recent literature shows post-operative detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can identify recurrence,
months before it is recognized on imaging. However, due to lack of sensitivity of current methods and limited
blood sample volumes, ctDNA signal often drops below limit of detection. Current approaches for ctDNA
analysis do not have adequate sensitivity to detect residual disease during and after completion of treatment.
 To address this gap, we have developed TARgeted DIgital Sequencing (TARDIS), an approach for
multiplexed analysis of several patient-specific mutations in ctDNA. In this application, we propose to first
analytically validate TARDIS for ctDNA detection and then clinically validate this approach as a biomarker for
treatment monitoring and residual disease detection in early and locally advanced breast cancer. In the UH2
analytical validation phase, we will assess analytical sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision and
reproducibility of TARDIS using reference material, tumor cell line dilutions and plasma samples from patients
with breast cancer. In the UH3 clinical validation phase, we will measure baseline ctDNA detection rates in
patients with early and locally advanced breast cancer, evaluate whether ctDNA levels after neoadjuvant
treatment are predictive of pathological Complete Response and evaluate the prognostic value of ctDNA
detection after surgical resection for disease-free survival.
 Our goal is to enable greater precision in treatment of patients with early and locally advanced breast cancer.
Once validated, ctDNA analysis and monitoring will complement existing diagnostic approaches such as
imaging and histopathology to help optimize management of patients with early and locally advanced breast
cancer."
11081863,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the neurobiologic
mechanisms responsible for oral cancer pain. The candidate is a clinician-scientist and is firmly committed to a
career in translational research studying the neurobiology of orofacial pain in pediatric patients. The outlined
proposal builds on the candidate’s previous basic and clinical research skills by integrating patient-oriented
translational research. Under the mentorship of Dr. Brian Schmidt at New York University, the candidate will
have the opportunity to work with a research program that defined the clinical phenotype of a painful orofacial
condition, and developed a paradigm that allows investigators to test nociceptive mechanisms responsible for
the phenotypic features of the painful condition. The proposed research and career development plan will
position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her transition to independence
as a translational scientist focused on the clinical management of orofacial pain in pediatric patients.
The incidence of oral cancer is rapidly increasing in the United States. More patients are afflicted with oral cancer
than melanoma, cervical cancer, or ovarian cancer. Orofacial pain is one of the most common initial symptoms
of oral cancer and often leads to the diagnosis of oral cancer. However, the character, severity, and unique
features of oral cancer pain widely differ between patients. There is currently no effective and lasting treatment
available to alleviate suffering from oral cancer pain. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that cancer causes
pain through the secretion of mediators that activate and sensitize nociceptors; however, the specific
contributions of nociceptive mediators and their mechanisms of action (i.e., responsible receptors) are unknown.
The foundation for this proposal is based on preliminary studies demonstrating that oral cancer patients
experience preoperative sensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chemosensitivity) and report greater functional (i.e.,
mechanosensitivity) pain. The outlined experiments will test the hypothesis that the quality of pain experienced
by oral cancer patients is dependent on the level of activation of specific channels on nociceptors. The overall
objectives of this proposal are to 1) develop and validate assays to quantify mechano- and chemosensitivity in
oral cancer patients, and compare the sensitivities to healthy subjects, and 2) determine the receptor subtypes
responsible for nociceptive behavior in an oral cancer mouse model. The knowledge gained from the proposed
research holds considerable promise for the development of novel, non-opioid treatment strategies that
specifically address the unique pain experienced by individual patients. Successful completion of the proposed
training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to direct an integrated clinical
and laboratory research program to address pain-related challenges in pediatric dental patients."

The role of microglia in the C9orf72 (C9) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
disease spectrum remains poorly understood. Early investigations found that microglia activation was
significantly higher in ALS with dementia and impaired executive function, suggesting that microglia activation
correlates with FTD-like symptoms in ALS. More recent neuropathologic examinations of microglia in FTLD
patient autopsy brains with mutations in progranulin versus C9orf72 concluded that the observed microglia
dysfunction was different between the two genetically different patient subgroups suggesting specificity of
microglia dysfunction depending on the etiology of the patient population. One interesting aspect of microglia-
neuron communication is the role of microglia in the maintenance and refinement of synaptic networks through
the selective pruning of synapses, which occurs predominantly during development but has been shown to also
be triggered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, including FTD. The degree of synapse loss in
AD strongly correlates with cognitive decline, even more than the amount of plaque, tangles or neuronal loss,
and a recent study of ALS postmortem tissue confirmed increased synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex of
patients with reported cognitive impairments. Our laboratory has preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that
there is an altered neural-immune interaction in the cortical forebrain regions of C9orf72 patients with
confirmed FTD in which microglia and neurons modify each other's function. Using patient-derived hiPSC
microglia and cortical neurons, we are able to show that C9 patient-derived hiPSC microglia mono-cultures do
have intrinsic phenotypes, including altered gene profiles, phagocytic activities and lysosomal function. Most
interestingly, preliminary data suggests that C9 microglia do regulate neuronal excitability and survival of C9
iPSC neurons. To further investigate the role and contribution of microglia in C9 cortical degeneration, we
propose to thoroughly investigate the intrinsic properties of C9 hiPSC-microglia (from all patient subgroups: FTD,
FTD/ALS, ALS; Aim1). For the first time, we will then co-culture these microglia with C9 and healthy control
hiPSC cortical neurons to better understand the co-regulation between these two cell types (Aim 2). Finally, in
the third aim, we will study microglia activation and pathology in C9 patient postmortem autopsy tissue. This will
include cell-type specific genetic profiling from existing snRNA seq data sets, immunohistochemistry of
microgliosis and multi-label immunostaining for microglial-specific candidate genes/proteins in conjunction with
C9 neuronal disease pathology markers (TDP-43 and C9 DPRs) to gain novel knowledge on whether microglia
are preferentially altered in close vicinity to neuronal pathologies."

Insomnia symptoms (i.e., difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep) in persons living with Alzheimer’s
Disease and related Dementias are debilitating and contribute to increased institutionalization, reduced
cognitive function and accelerated disease progression. Furthermore, insomnia disruption is linked to poor
health outcomes in caregivers, such as poor quality of life and increased burden. Given the potential harmful
side effects of pharmacologic treatment, non-pharmacologic approaches, such as music, may provide a safer
alternative to improving insomnia symptoms. Music interventions are particularly promising because long-term
memory for music remains relatively preserved in Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias - even in the
moderate stage of the disease. Prior studies of music interventions to improve sleep in older adults were
conducted with persons without Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias in primarily Caucasian older
adults. Thus, the evidence for tailored music interventions to improve sleep in underrepresented community-
dwelling persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers is lacking. In a pilot study (funded by the
NIA, F32AG060630) the applicant has examined the feasibility of one component of the proposed music-based
intervention in PLWD and their caregivers and identified opportunities to improve the delivery of the
intervention. The purpose of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is to
provide her with the expertise necessary to initiate a successful and independent program of research – with
the ultimate goal to improve sleep and behavioral symptoms in PLWD and their caregivers using music-based
approaches. The specific aims of this proposal are to: i) build and iteratively refine the prototype of the mobile
application, entitled, “Calming Music Personalized for Sleep Enhancement in PeRsons living with Dementia”
(CoMPoSER) for use among PLWD and their caregivers; ii) in a pilot RCT examine its acceptability; and iii)
efficacy. The development of the intervention will be guided by the input from stakeholders, including PLWD
and their caregivers. Seventy-two dyads will be randomized to either the 4-week CoMPoSER intervention or
sleep education group. Music selections will be tailored to PLWD and account for known sleep-inducing
properties. Acceptability will be examined using survey and qualitative data. The effects of the intervention on
PLWD and caregiver outcomes will be determined using objective (actigraphy) and subjective (proxy reported)
measures. Under the guidance of the mentoring team, the applicant has carefully constructed research training
activities to gain knowledge and expertise in four core areas: i) user-centered design of mobile application
technology, ii) behavioral intervention development, iii) Community-based Participatory Research, and iv)
behavioral research methods, including measurement, analysis and dissemination of clinical trial research.
Results from the proposed research project will not only inform a larger efficacy trial, but also provide an
opportunity for the applicant to gain the necessary skills to launch her career as an independent investigator."

The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) plays a central role in regulating systemic blood pressure. This is illustrated
by the proven benefit of RAS-targeted drugs such as angiotensin receptor blockers, which are critical to the
treatment of hypertension, heart failure and kidney disease. The actions of the RAS depend on the peptide
angiotensin II (ang II) acting on cells that express the G-protein coupled type 1 angiotensin receptor (human:
AT1; mouse: AT1a). Our group has been at the forefront of unmasking cell-specific roles of ang II signaling
within different cell populations in the kidney. These studies have revealed novel roles for ang II to act distinctly
in different cell types to drive pathogenic mechanisms associated with hypertension. This suggests that the
overall, systemic effect of ang II on blood pressure results from the cumulative actions of ang II on multiple cell
types within the body. Our preliminary studies analyzed recently published single-cell RNA Sequencing datasets
to explore the cell-specific expression of angiotensin receptors within the kidney. We find that pericytes, a mural
cell type associated with capillaries and the glomerulus, express the mouse AT1a receptor. Additionally, we
confirmed this by measuring AT1a expression from rapidly sorted pericytes from the kidney. However, the role
of angiotensin signaling in pericytes remains under-examined. This is despite multiple lines of evidence that
suggest renal pericytes play a central role in regulating blood pressure and renal injury, angiotensin-linked
processes which are pathologically altered in hypertension and chronic kidney disease. This project will test the
overall hypothesis that angiotensin II signaling within pericytes contributes to the development of hypertension
and renal injury. This candidate has developed a novel mouse line which has inducible pericyte-specific deletion
of the AT1a receptor. First, the contribution of pericyte ang II signaling to blood pressure control will be
determined under baseline conditions and during ang II hypertension. Next, the effect of ang II signaling within
pericytes on renal injury in the context of hypertension will be assessed. This research will be carried out by an
applicant with excellent training in biomedical research with a strong publication record. The training for this
proposal will occur at Oregon Health & Science University within the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension
under the primary mentorship of Dr. Susan Gurley a leader in the field of cell-specific actions of RAS signaling
in the kidney. This project will also be supported by two other co-mentors: Dr. Anusha Mishra, an expert on
pericyte biology and microvascular blood flow, and Dr. Lynne Sakai, an expert on vascular fibrotic signaling.
Career development activities include training in mouse micro-surgery, ex vivo slice imaging, assessment of
renal pathology, and bioinformatic analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. This training is designed to
launch the candidate to lead the next generation of kidney research with well-honed skills in animal physiology
and molecular biology. This will setup the candidate to meet his long-term career coal of becoming an
independent investigator focusing on the cellular and molecular causes of hypertension and renal injury."

Christian Saenz is currently a PhD student in Economics at Georgia State University and will have a major role
in this administrative supplement. Christian aspires to become an independent health economist and addiction
researcher. Saenz will receive detailed training in career development and in conducting tobacco policy and
addiction research as part of this supplement. The parent grant’s aims are as follows: (1) estimate the effect of
flavor bans with varying levels of strength on youth e-cigarette use, combustible tobacco product use, and
substitution towards the remaining legally available flavored tobacco products; (2) estimate the effect of
Tobacco-21 laws on youth e-cigarette use, combustible tobacco product use, and source of e-cigarettes; and
(3) estimate the effect of e-cigarette taxes, including new e-cigarette tax schema of sales taxes and two-tier
taxes, on youth e-cigarette use and CTP use. This proposed administrative supplement will complement the
parent grant’s aims by exploring how e-cigarette tax responsiveness is impacted by out-of-state and Indian
reservation purchasing, by identifying specific components of Tobacco-21 laws that make them more effective,
and by identifying the effect of e-cigarette introduction in 2006 on short- and medium-term smoking-attributable
mortality. The research proposal will leverage high quality survey data, restricted-use mortality data, and
proprietary Nielsen Homescan and Retail Scanner panel data, to study these questions. This research is
significant because it will provide insight into the economic substitution or complement relationship between
e-cigarettes and relatively more dangerous combustible tobacco; estimate heterogeneity in effectiveness of
state T21 legislation based on the strength or ‘bite’ of three specific components of the bundled legislation,
identify the elements of optimal T21 regulation; determine how tax avoidance behaviors affect e-cigarette tax
responsiveness; and estimate short- and medium-term smoking-attributable mortality effects of the e-cigarette
entry in the U.S. market in 2006. This research, if funded, would be innovative by using recent innovations on
the differences-in-differences model designed to mitigate bias from heterogeneous treatment effects and
endogeneity bias such as Callaway and Sant’Anna estimators and event study designs; by answering novel
research questions using proprietary data, and estimating state policy heterogeneity in order to inform future
legislative efforts."
11063055,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified immune pathways linked to the pathogenesis of
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, despite these insights, our understanding of how individual
genetic variants promote autoimmunity remains poor. Loss-of-function mutations in genes of the phagocytic
NADPH oxidase complex (NOX2), including NCF1 and NCF2, have been linked with the pathogenesis of SLE
and other humoral autoimmune diseases. The current model for how reduced NOX2 activity promotes lupus
development focuses on defects in the clearance of apoptotic material by phagocytic myeloid lineages. While
myeloid defects likely contribute to disease risk, we hypothesize that a parallel B cell-intrinsic mechanism
underlies the profound increase risk of SLE in human carriers of NCF1 and NCF2 variants. In addition to the
production of pathogenic autoantibodies, recent studies have demonstrated that B cells can promote lupus
pathogenesis by initiating immune tolerance breaks and facilitating the generation of spontaneous germinal
centers (GC). The activation of autoreactive B cells in SLE requires B cell-intrinsic expression of the endosomal
toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR9, and our published and preliminary data show that reduced NOX2 activity
results in dysregulated endosomal TLR signaling by impacting non-canonical autophagy pathways. Based on
these data, we hypothesize that a B cell-specific reduction in NOX2 activity will result in enhanced TLR-
dependent GC formation and the development of humoral autoimmunity. We will test this idea via parallel in vivo
and in vitro mechanistic studies. In Aim 1, we will test whether B cell-intrinsic deletion NOX2 component genes
results in enhanced TLR-dependent GC responses using a well-characterized model of viral infection. In Aim 2,
we will study whether reduced NOX2 activity promotes autoantibody production and humoral autoimmunity in
murine SLE. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use biochemical and cell imaging approaches to test whether NAPDH
oxidase activity impacts B cell TLR signaling and non-canonical autophagy pathways using both murine genetic
models and gene-edited human B cells. This supplemental research proposal will extend these proposed
Specific Aims and test a new hypothesis that loss of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein similarly impacts
B cell endolysosomal trafficking, resulting in enhanced TLR signaling. Together, these studies promise to
advance our understanding of B cell biology and mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of humoral
autoimmunity, allowing the candidate to receive clinically-relevant scientific training in support of their long-term
career goals."

Despite advances in therapeutic strategies, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the
deadliest malignancies. An opportunity exists to impact mortality from PDAC by preventing the development of
the disease through preventing progression of one of its most important precursors, intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). IPMN is a significant health problem with a high prevalence with an estimate of 6%
of MRI studies obtained for other indications demonstrating IPMN(s). Although most IPMNs are quiescent, they
represent a source of great anxiety for patients because of the fear of developing PDAC. Since 30% of PDACs
arise from IPMNs, these lesions also represent an opportunity to intercept the development of PDAC. Therefore,
is an unmet need to develop biomarkers that predict IPMN progression and strategies to intercept IPMN
progression to PDAC. We have made substantial progress in developing strategies to intercept IPMN
progression as illustrated in the parent grant of this supplement application which is translating discoveries from
our laboratory regarding the role of a micronutrient (delta-tocotrienol (DT3)) in preventing IPMN progression in a
Phase 2 prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Emerging studies suggest that the IPMN
Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME) may play a critical role in a crosstalk with pancreatic ductal epithelial
cells in promoting the progression of IPMN to PDAC. However, the role of specific immune cells and the
underlying mechanisms driving TIME mediated IPMN progression is poorly understood. To address this
knowledge gap, we propose to test the central hypothesis that crosstalk between specific immune cells
and pancreatic ductal cells influence the switch from quiescent (low-grade) IPMN to aggressive (high-
grade) IPMN leading to invasive PDAC. Using a combination of human patient samples and genetically
engineered mouse models, as well as in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches, we propose to map immune cell
populations and functional status around normal pancreatic duct, low-grade IPMN, high-grade IPMN, and
invasive PDAC in humans (Aim 1); and define the function of immune cells at different stages of carcinogenesis
in human and mouse (Aim 2). The supplement will allow Mrs. Krystal Villalobos-Ayala to receive further training
in conducting basic and translational research. Her results will assist in defining the role of TIME in PDAC
evolution ultimately contributing to further insights into novel immunological strategies to intercept IPMN
progression to PDAC."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated, and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder.
Although the prevalence of AD is increasing, there are no effective therapies that can prevent or delay AD onset.
 Brain-derived lipoproteins (BLps) transport lipids throughout the brain and can protect against or
exacerbate AD progression, depending on their composition. For example, the E4 isoform of the major BLp
scaffold protein APOE can stabilize amyloid-beta (Aβ), leading to plaque formation and AD risk. However, due
to the suboptimal isolation of BLps in earlier studies, and the use of unlipidated APOE4, important questions
have been left unanswered. What factors regulate BLp processing, and can they be targeted to treat AD?
 Microglia play a major role in BLp processing and AD pathophysiology. Recent studies have shown that
phagocytic microglia are defined by their elevated expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL); the rate-limiting enzyme
in lipoprotein hydrolysis and uptake. Notably, LPL-expressing microglia engulf Aβ to protect against Aβ plaque
formation. The notion that LPL is protective is consistent with epidemiological studies showing reduced Aβ
plaque formation and decreased AD prevalence in individuals harboring gain-of-function LPL variants. Although
LPL is a potential target for the treatment of AD, this has not been validated in vivo.
 My laboratory has substantial expertise in lipid metabolism, LPL biology, and microglia and is uniquely
positioned to investigate LPL as a therapeutic target for AD. We have previously shown that LPL regulates
microglial phagocytosis, lipoprotein uptake, and immune function, hence identifying LPL as an immunometabolic
gatekeeper in microglia. Furthermore, our compelling preliminary data has shown that increasing LPL activity
can enhance microglial phagocytosis of Aβ and BLps. Therefore, we hypothesize that microglial-LPL helps
to clear Aβ and excess BLps to protect against AD development and that increasing LPL activity in vivo
can ameliorate AD progression. To test this, in AIM I, we will use microglial-specific knockdown mice
(MiLPLKD) and AD-susceptible mice (5xFAD) to empirically determine whether pharmacological LPL activation
can halt AD progression. We will also use state-of-the-art metabolic imaging and ‘omics approaches to identify
LPL-dependent mechanisms controlling microglial metabolism and function. In AIM II, we will use native BLps
carefully isolated from human CSF to define LPL-dependent mechanisms governing lipoprotein processing by
microglia and to determine whether enhancing LPL activity is a rational strategy to restore lipid handling in
APOE4 carriers. The findings from this study will be transformative to our understanding of lipoprotein handling
in the brain and the mechanisms leading to AD neuropathogenesis. Our study will not only determine LPL-
dependent mechanisms regulating microglial metabolism and function but will also ascertain whether novel LPL
activators can improve microglial function to ameliorate AD pathology, a new strategy with major clinical impact."

The pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans continues to be the cause of 15% of AIDS-related mortality,
primarily in under-resourced areas of the globe. The work outlined in the proposal is a continuation of work
investigating post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms of stress adaptation in this important fungal
pathogen and investigate their conservation across clinical isolates from AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in
Africa. We have implicated translatome reprogramming as a requirement for the adaptation to host-
temperature stress as well as oxidative stress. This reprogramming is regulated at two points: the entry of
mRNAs into the translating pool through regulation of translation initiation, and the removal of mRNAs from the
pool by deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay. These two pathways cooperate in a stress-specific and
intensity-dependent manner to achieve a stress-adaptive translatome. In this proposal, we propose three
specific aims that outline a mechanistic investigation of these processes. First, we will investigate the
translational regulation of Gcn4, the transcription factor that controls expression of the integrated stress
response (ISR) regulon. We will define the C. neoformans ISR, and define the direct targets of Gcn4 in C.
neoformans. Second, we will build on preliminary data demonstrating that translation initiation regulation by the
kinase Gcn2 is activated by perturbations in other post-transcriptional and translation regulatory pathways
suggesting a role for Gcn2 as a failsafe responder to stress. We will investigate the contributions to
translatome reprogramming of these additional pathways, Hog1/p38, Nonsense Mediate Decay (NMD) and
Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) and investigate the role of Gcn2 activation in either suppressing or
exacerbating defects in translatome reprogramming or virulence phenotype. Finally, we will investigate the
mechanisms of translatome reprogramming in a panel of environmental C. neoformans isolates, as well as a
large collection of clinical isolates of C. neoformans from people with AIDS-associated cryptococcosis in Africa
that have accompanying outcome data and are fully genome sequenced. We will investigate the thresholds for
activation of these pathways and the intensity and duration of responses across the isolates, assessing
temperature dependent changes in translational output and both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intracellular
reactive oxygen species as ISR activators. We will also determine if the ISR regulon differs across the panel of
clinical isolates. This work will define pathways responsible for the agility of this important pathogen that differ
from non-pathogen environmental relatives and from the model yeast and identify additional targets for future
therapeutic interventions."

There is a sex-based difference in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Vascular
contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), the two most common forms of
dementia. Females have a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD), as well as sex-based differences in cardiovascular risk factors for dementia. In a
subgroup of participants from the risk reduction for Alzheimer’s disease (rrAD; NCT02913664)
clinical trial at baseline, we found a sex difference in plasma AD biomarkers. Females had
higher levels of total tau and total tau/Ab42 while pTau181 was higher in males, with no
difference found in the Ab42/40 ratio. VCID biomarkers also show no sex-based differences.
There was however a sex-based difference in the association between AD and VCID
biomarkers. In females, VEGF-D associated with total Tau, while in males VEGF-D associated
with pTau181 and pTau181/Ab42, and bFGF associated with Tau/Ab42. These preliminary
findings support a sex-based difference of biomarkers in the pathogenesis of VCID and AD in
cognitively healthy older adults. However, there is still a reluctance in human studies to stratify
cohorts by sex. Moreover, there is great appreciation for the importance of the crosstalk
between the systemic immune system and the brain pathologies in ADRDs. However, the role of
systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of ADRDs remains under-explored. The purpose of
the proposed supplement is to investigate the sex effects of independent and combined effects
of Intensive pharmacological Reduction of Vascular Risk factors (IRVR) i.e. hypertension and
dyslipidemia and aerobic Exercise (Ex) on inflammation and cognitive function. Here, we will
test the hypothesis that females in IRVR+Ex will ameliorate AD/VCID-associated biomarkers
and pro-inflammatory cytokines and associate with better cognitive function by testing the
following aims: Aim1: To determine whether there is a sex difference in inflammatory cytokines
and injury markers in the plasma between IRVR+Ex and IRVR or Ex and their association with
AD/VCID biomarkers. Aim2: To determine whether there is a sex-mediated amelioration in
alteration in peripheral immune cells in IRVR+Ex compared to IRVR or Ex.
The long-term goal of this project is to identify inflammatory biomarkers that will be predictive of
ADRD in males and females."
11064395,"Recent technological advances in mobile health have catalyzed the rapid growth of large volumes of digital health data due to its potential for scientific impact and health relevance for general populations. This growth imposes unique challenges for machine learning, computation, and information science due to the sheer volumes and high frequencies of longitudinal measurements over time. While machine learning, particularly deep learning, has led to major advances across various data types, its application in modeling time series health data to develop smarter health care systems remains challenging, with relatively low adoption in real-world healthcare settings. Primary reasons for these challenges lie in the irregular, multi-resolution health data collected from diverse subjects who display significant variations in their behaviors and responses to different treatments. Neglecting population diversity contributes significantly to health disparities, as policies and decisions often disregard marginalized minority groups. This proposal provides fundamental and rigorous solutions to address these challenges for complex heterogenous data with a particular focus on mobile health data. More specifically, our research is inspired by social determinants of health (SDoH) that impact health disparities among women in the U.S using two ethnically diverse women’s health datasets, where the data present high heterogeneity and multi-resolution features over time. We aim to flexibly extract the essential information from heterogeneous signals across high-dimensional omni-channels over time and integrate information from multi-resolution variables, to enhance prediction precision and interpretability. We further target online sequential policy optimization that provides non-invasive intervention treatments over time to maximize individuals’ health outcomes according to their heterogeneity. In summary, our research aims to: (1) Develop deep neural models for understanding and predicting individual health over time, while learning shared patterns across multiple individuals to enhance interpretability of the results; (2) Create novel data integration techniques for multi-resolution mobile health data, accommodating irregular time intervals, diverse sampling rates, and measurement variations among subjects; (3) Implement a reinforcement learning platform to find subject-specific optimal policies under populational heterogeneity; (4) Apply the proposed methods to identify biopsychosocial factors affecting women’s health, enabling the development of early prevention and intervention strategies to enhance overall well-being in women."
11080110,"Summary/Abstract
Immune cell therapies are a powerful new class of “living medicines” for treating cancer and other diseases, but
producing them remains laborious, inefficient, and slow. The chief bottleneck is the challenge of making accurate
changes to the DNA of extremely large numbers—often billions—of human cells ex vivo. Gene editing with
CRISPR-Cas9 is much more precise than lentiviral or retroviral vectors, but it remains difficult to deliver controlled
amounts of the Cas9 endonuclease into human cells, particularly immune cells. A promising approach is to
momentarily disrupt the plasma membrane, allowing direct transport of DNA-editing proteins into the cytosol.
However, current & emerging nonviral delivery methods are nonuniform, damaging to cells, and too slow for
clinical applications that require billions of cells. Therefore, the research objective of this proposal is to develop
a very fast microfluidic method of permeabilizing the plasma membrane to facilitate efficient delivery of DNA-
editing proteins. The central innovation is to use viscoelastic fluid forces to stretch the plasma membrane without
cells touching any surfaces. As a result, this “contactless” approach is efficient, gentle, robust, and extraordinarily
fast—exceeding 100 million cells per minute in a single microchannel. The K99 phase of the project will focus
on developing this technology for efficient gene editing of T cells with CRISPR, to address the main bottleneck
in T cell engineering. In Aim 1, we will develop viscoelastic stretching for ribonucleoprotein delivery and allogenic
T cell engineering at one billion cells per minute, and we will characterize the biological effects of cell stretching
on T cells. In Aim 2, we will use this method to generate allogenic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells from
primary T cells, and assay their anti-tumor potency in vitro. In the R00 phase, viscoelastic cell stretching will be
developed into a high throughput “cell surgery” platform for directly transplanting exogenous proteins and other
nanoscale cargoes into the cytosol, towards the long-term goal of increasing the safety, accuracy, and efficiency
of gene editing in human cells. Building upon the knowledge, skills, and technologies gained during the K99
phase, Aim 3 will focus on delivering DNA repair factors such as Rad52 in protein form for the first time, to
temporarily increase the frequency of homology-directed repair and thereby safely increase the efficiency of

COVID-19 increases the risk of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). VCID is
one of the most prevalent forms of dementia, so the potential public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on future VCID is substantial. However, the mechanisms by which COVID-19 modifies VCID are unknown.
Identifying mechanisms that regulate how prior COVID-19 influences the brain endothelial cell response to
vascular stress is important. Here, we provide preliminary evidence that COVID-19 decreases resistance to
VCID by weakening the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This is accompanied by cerebrovascular inflammation. This
grant will test the novel mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerates VCID by suppressing
cerebrovascular Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In Aim 1, we determine how prior SARS-CoV-2 infection
influences BBB permeability and cognition upon subsequent vascular insult, by genetic and epigenetic
modification. In Aim 2 we use endothelial-targeted genetic interventions to assess the contribution of Wnt/β-
cat targets to resistance to post-infectious VCID. In Aim 3, we ask whether established post-infectious VCID
can be reversed by increasing cerebrovascular Wnt/β-catenin. These studies could lead to novel approaches
to identify individuals at high risk for VCID and novel potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate the impact of
prior infection on the development of dementia."

11081266,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The global population is aging rapidly; the number of adults over 65 is expected to double by
2050. Chronological aging is an established risk factor for neurodegeneration and leads to
dysfunction and loss of the motor unit (MU; a motor neuron and all the myofibers it innervates).
Genetic variants may accelerate biological aging and acquired cellular damage in the nervous
system. Aged mammalian tissues retain an epigenetic signature, and recent publications highlight
multiple strategies to restore youthful tissue resilience, such as cellular reprogramming. My long-
term career goal is to obtain a tenure-track clinician-scientist position at an academic institution
and establish a translational research program. My long-term scientific goal is to investigate
cellular aging of the nervous system in the setting of genetic predisposition. My short-term
scientific goal and the foundation of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that targeting biological
aging pathways independently and in conjunction with disease-specific gene therapies may
provide a promising avenue for treatment development. The K00 phase will build upon my
experience during the F99 phase by leveraging MU physiology, pathology and viral vectors to
study aging and neurodegeneration more broadly. As a postdoc, I will study the interdependence
between physiological triggers of disease (genome and exposome), biological aging, and
phenotype. Specifically, the proposed work will investigate AAV-mediated cellular reprogramming
of transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 to improve MU longevity, resilience and repair, and
then apply this approach to genetic MU disease. Aim 2A will test the effect of induced, transient
reprogramming of individual MU cell types on functional, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and
histopathological outcomes. Aim 2B will investigate the value of cellular reprogramming in
enhancing aged MU repair and resilience when faced with MU insults. Aim 2C will test the utility
of multi-transgene delivery of longevity-promoting cellular reprogramming independently and in
conjunction with existing gene therapies to have a synergistic effect on disease phenotype. These
studies will provide critical information about mechanisms of MU longevity, resilience and repair
and test a therapeutic approach which has implications for all age-related neurodegenerative
disease. Beyond this, the proposed career development plan has been thoughtfully designed to
develop the technical expertise, science communication skills, and mentorship experience
essential to becoming an independent investigator."

Cannabis-related policy changes in the US and abroad have outpaced science and research about the impacts
different potential regulatory approaches have on consumer safety, public health, equity, and other outcomes.
Convening regulators from different government jurisdictions to discuss lessons learned and emerging
challenges in cannabis policy and regulation has never been more important. The Cannabis Regulators
Association (CANNRA) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)(4) association of government agencies engaged in
cannabis, cannabinoid, and hemp regulation and policy implementation across 45 states and U.S. territories,
Canada, and the Netherlands. The current proposal requests funding to support CANNRA’s 2024 Annual
Member Meeting, a unique event that brings together government officials to discuss different regulatory issues,
share new approaches being taken in their jurisdictions, troubleshoot challenges, and build new skills and
connections to support their ongoing government regulatory work. The meeting is restricted to government
officials only to ensure open sharing and exchange across government jurisdictions. The meeting has two
specific aims: Aim 1 is to improve regulatory science by identifying, discussing, and debating emerging research
and practice-based outcomes in cannabinoid policy and regulation, and Aim 2 is to develop and foster skills that
government regulators can use to implement policies that protect public health and consumer safety. Meeting
content is guided by CANNRA’s Executive Director and PI, Dr. Gillian Schauer, and a Meeting Organizing
Committee comprised of the lead cannabis and/or hemp regulators from seven diverse states (CA, CO, GA, IL,
MD, MO, OK). They work closely with CANNRA Voting Members (key designees from each CANNRA-member
jurisdiction) and co-chairs from CANNRA’s twelve different standing committees to develop and facilitate the
meeting content. Session and workshop moderators are all CANNRA member government officials, and the PI
and Organizing Committee work with moderators to identify panelists who represent diverse perspectives.
Agenda topics are selected using input from past year Member Meeting participants and CANNRA Members
and include skill-based workshops to improve and enhance the skillset regulators can apply to their work. Panel
discussions and workshops are directly relevant to FDA’s mission and the mission of the FDA Office of
Regulation and will cover topics that include: cannabinoid hemp products and policies; cannabinoid product
safety and lab testing; product standards; packaging and labeling regulations; technology and cannabis; data
monitoring; using science to inform policy; public health and youth prevention; and more. CANNRA directly
invites over 900 government staff who participate in CANNRA through our online collaboration platform and
Special Committees. Following the Meeting, CANNRA will disseminate findings and take-aways to government
officials by recording key sessions and making them available to government regulators who cannot attend in
person, and by conducting meeting “report outs” through CANNRA committees."
11063089,"Background: Despite high numbers of VHA patients (>300,000) receiving long-term opioid therapy (LTOT),
evidence of its harms is growing (e.g., inadequate pain control, side effects, overdoses). Although VA/DoD
Guidelines recommend frequent, multi-component monitoring of LTOT patients, monitoring is under-utilized
because it does not fit with primary care’s workflow. In addition, rates of opioid discontinuation are increasing,
even though discontinuation is often harmful (e.g., more use of street heroin, worsening mental health).
Further, for patients for whom both continued LTOT and tapering for discontinuation are determined to be
potentially harmful, a clinical practice guideline (CPG) is not available, leaving them “guideline-orphaned.”
Significance: With increasing opioid overdose deaths and complications of LTOT due to comorbidities, policy
emphases have shifted to reducing opioid prescribing, and monitoring and discontinuing opioids among LTOT
patients. This project will help providers maintain high-quality patient care while responding to policy shifts. It
addresses the VHA’s and HSR&D’s goal of offering patient-centered care by giving providers an integrated
instrument to reduce harms due to LTOT continuation and discontinuation, which are widespread and severe
among Veterans. Innovation: This project has the potential to change LTOT practices by giving primary care
and other providers new, easy-to-use screening tools that will facilitate adherence to recommended guidelines
on monitoring of LTOT patients, and discontinuation of LTOT when it is harmful. The integrated instrument may
be incorporated into CPRS to facilitate its use in VA health care clinics. The project will also change practice by
providing new, provisional guidelines for a challenging group of LTOT patients for whom CPGs do not exist.
The work to be accomplished is complementary to VHA initiatives by contributing to components of best
practices for balancing pain management and opioid prescribing, “S.T.O.P. P.A.I.N,” i.e., Stepped care model;
Treatment alternatives; Ongoing monitoring of usage; and Practice guidelines. Specific Aims are to develop an
integrated instrument with two screening tools, the first to indicate if LTOT is harmful to continue (yes or no;
Aim 1), and the second to indicate if tapering to discontinue opioids is harmful to initiate (yes or no; Aim 2).
Positive screens will indicate that providers should undertake additional, more comprehensive monitoring and
examination to determine the harm of continued LTOT or tapering to discontinuation, respectively. Aim 3:
Inform subsequent CPGs by determining preliminary treatment approaches for “guideline-orphaned” LTOT
patients. Methods to develop the tools will involve (1) comprehensive literature searches to yield an initial item
bank for each screening tool; (2) qualitative item analyses using focus groups with patients and providers,
cognitive interviewing with patients, expert review, and item revision to yield small item banks for each
screening tool for field testing; and (3) field testing to yield the final bank of items for each screening tool, which
will include (a) linking patients’ (n=500 for each tool) telephone survey responses to their electronic health
record data from the Corporate Data Warehouse, and (b) reliability testing (n=30 patients). Methods to work
toward the CPG will follow the same methods used to develop the VA/DoD CPG for the Management of
Substance Use Disorders, which consist of (1) conducting a systematic review, (2) obtaining input from the
expert reviewers, and (3) drafting and submitting a preliminary guideline about the management of “orphaned”
LTOT patients to our operations partners on this project. Next steps/Implementation: The next step in this
research program will be a multi-site project to examine the extent to which use of the screening tools and
potential CPG, resulting from this proposed study, is associated with improved patient outcomes (e.g., fewer
overdoses), and health care system utilization and costs (e.g., fewer emergency department visits and
hospitalizations for opioid-related acute crises). Next steps also include partnering on quality improvement
projects to implement the screening tools and CPG in VA primary care and pain clinics."
11063413,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Membrane Associated RING CH (MARCH) proteins are RING E3 ubiquitin ligases that are implicated in the
regulation of membrane receptors. This family of ubiquitin ligases emerged after the discovery of K3 and K5, two
viral MARCH-homologues in Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which are critical in evading the
host’s immune response by ubiquitinating and subsequently removing the major histocompatibility complex class
II (MHC-II) receptors from the surface of the cells and therefore blocking antigen presentation. The cellular
MARCH family of proteins consists of 11 members that share structural similarity and contain a RING-CH domain
that is essential for the removal and internalization of target membrane receptors (e.g. MHC-II). Recent reports
showed that MARCH proteins can also potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection.
MARCH1, 2 and 8 restrict HIV-1 and other retroviruses by blocking the incorporation of the viral envelope in the
budding virions. This proposal explores aspects of the MARCH-mediated antiretroviral mechanism that have
never been previously studied. Currently, there is no information concerning a viral protein that counteracts
MARCH proteins. The first aim of this research plan examines the mechanism by which an HIV encoded factor
counteracts MARCH8 during infection. The second aim examines the susceptibility of HIV-1 envelopes from
different subtypes to MARCH-mediated restriction as well as the ability of HIV-1 proteins from different subtypes
to counteract MARCH8. Preliminary studies show that HIV-1 over time becomes resistant to MARCH restriction.
The third aim will determine the changes in the HIV-1 genome that render it resistant to MARCH inhibition.
Finally, the fourth aim will address the role of the other MARCH proteins on HIV-1 infection. In summary, these
studies will shed new light on the anti-retroviral role of MARCH proteins and will address aspects of MARCH-
mediated HIV-1 inhibition that have not been previously determined. Finally, these proteins have strong potential
as clinical targets for the development of antiretroviral therapeutics."
11063645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studies of cardiovascular disease increasingly embrace pragmatic clinical trials (PCT) to evaluate interventions
under real-world conditions, often targeting under-resourced populations with high disease prevalence and
disproportionate exposure to environmental risk factors, to generate data that may be more translatable and
patient-centered than data from traditional randomized control trials. Community-based PCTs have several,
morally-salient characteristics that raise novel and pressing ethical questions relating to researchers’
responsibilities and human protections. These studies are (1) often intentionally conducted in populations with
high disease prevalence and limited available health care resources; (2) tend to impose upon, and extract
value from, communities and community-based organizations that are socio-economically vulnerable; (3) occur
outside the clinical setting, thereby positioning researchers in close physical proximity to participants or non-
participants who could benefit from the research team’s knowledge, network, or clinical judgement.
In turn, community-based PCTs prompt us to reconsider researcher responsibilities to not only protect from
research-related harm but also to provide assistance or benefit to members of the community in which the
study is conducted. There is a notable dearth of work attending to the ethics of PCTs conducted in community
settings, which the proposed bioethics administrative supplement addresses by leveraging the study design
and community relationships of the parent grant, AirPressureNYC (HL168597). The parent grant employs a
sham PCT design to evaluate the effect of indoor portable air cleaners on blood pressure of New York City
public housing residents with stable hypertension. Thus far ≥10% of individuals who directly interact with the
research team through the screening process have been excluded from the study, most often because of
asymptomatic hypertension above the inclusion criteria of 160/90 mmHg. The research teams’ ambivalence
about how to manage their relationship to these individuals is what first motivated this line of inquiry.
In the proposed supplement, we will empirically explore public and key stakeholder opinions on investigators’
obligations to members of communities engaged in PCTs, including study participants and non-participants,
with specific focus on individuals excluded after screening. We will then conduct a normative analysis using the
empirical data along with a thematic synthesis of the relevant literature to generate an ethical framework for
characterizing and meeting these researcher obligations, directly informing guidance for PCT protocol
development and oversight. This research will provide practicable directives for the ethical conduct of
community based PCTs, specifically addressing NHLBI research priorities of confronting bioethical issues
relevant to novel trial design and investigations involving vulnerable populations."

Unlike conventional T/B lymphocytes, a group of innate-like T cells, such as γδT cells and invariant NK
T (iNKT) cells, preferentially reside in epithelial tissues such as the skin where they play important roles
in the first line of defense to maintain the tissue integrity and, when dysregulated, also contribute to the
tissue inflammatory diseases. Understanding how skin-specific localization and maintenance of innate-
like T cells are regulated is critical in helping to design strategies targeting these cells for therapeutic
purposes. Our preliminary studies found that iNKT cells generated in the thymus of early postnatal
stages preferentially acquire a skin-homing property for their specific distribution into the skin.
Considering the skin is the outmost barrier tissue exposed to foreign environments immediately after
the birth of a body, we propose that the preferential generation of the skin-homing iNKT cells in the
thymus are important for protection of the “border” in the infant and young and the establishment of the
local immune homeostasis. In this grant application, we will dissect mechanisms regulating thymic
generation of skin-homing iNKT cells and their roles in helping skin tissue development and
homeostasis."

Although early stage colorectal cancer (CRC) is curable with surgery, there is a critical need to stratify high-risk
early stage patients that would benefit from adjuvant treatment. In contrast to early stage CRC, late-stage
metastatic CRC (mCRC) is usually lethal presenting a critical need to match treatment modalities to patients
based on molecular phenotyping. To address these unmet clinical needs the proposed study aims to
understand the molecular mechanisms enabling primary CRCs to metastasize with the longer-term goal of
rationally guiding treatment decisions. While transcriptome sequencing has provided an unbiased method for
discovering lncRNAs, existing large-scale sequencing projects are comprised of predominantly primary tumors
without matched metastatic samples. This represents a critical barrier to studying lncRNAs involved in the
progression of primary to metastatic disease. To address this gap, we conducted the first meta-analysis of
normal, primary, and distant metastatic tissues across CRC patients to identify differentially expressed RNAs
Associated with Metastasis (RAMS). We prioritized a previously uncharacterized nuclear localized lncRNA,
RAMS11, since: (1) its expression correlated with metastatic progression, (2) its expression associated with
poor disease-free survival across multiple independent patient cohorts, and (3) it promoted oncogenic
phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Further, subsequent mechanistic experiments demonstrated RAMS11-
dependent recruitment of Chromobox protein 4 (CBX4) to transcriptionally activate Topoisomerase II alpha
(TOP2α). This provides a strong rationale for our hypothesis that RAMS11 interacts with CBX4 to
epigenetically regulate genes to promote oncogenic phenotypes and treatment resistance. This study will focus
on dissecting how RAMS11 dependent CBX4 target gene regulation confers oncogenic phenotypes in vitro
and in vivo. We will also assess whether RAMS11 can help identify high-risk CRC patients and its role in
chemotherapy resistance. Overall, our proposal will significantly advance the lncRNA tumor biology field by
providing mechanistic insight into RAMS11 epigenetic regulation to promote mCRC. Our research has
translational impact by evaluating the potential role of RAMS11 to stratify CRC patients at high-risk of develop
recurrent/metastatic disease that would benefit from specific adjuvant therapies."

 Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major hospital-acquired illness that causes severe morbidity and
mortality. In 2011, the CDC reported that there were 453,000 cases of CDI in the United States, with 29,000
deaths. The emergence of epidemic strains, notably NAP1/027, has considerably increased the prevalence and
severity of the disease. This clade of C. difficile developed resistance to both metronidazole (a CDI medication)
and fluoroquinolones (commonly used antibiotics). As a result, two selection forces drove the worldwide spread
of epidemic strains. Now the strains are increasingly becoming resistant to vancomycin, the antibiotic of choice
for CDI. Vancomycin is an important first-line treatment for CDI, and increased prescribing of this antibiotic has
raised selection pressures. Vancomycin resistance is increasingly more prevalent in epidemic strains, especially
NAP1/027, and our study revealed that these strains are spreading internationally. This is concerning since this
lineage is associated with severe illness and rapid transmission in hospitals. Preliminary findings indicate that
patients infected with vancomycin resistant strains are twice as likely to have poor clinical outcomes. Genome
analyses indicate these strains are developing primary and secondary resistance mechanisms that allow them
to persist in drug concentrations predicted to occur in the colons of patients. Critical questions remain to
understand this emerging form of C. difficile, which address in three cohesive aims. In one goal, we perform
clinical studies and epidemiological research using biobanked samples and patient metadata to understand how
these emerging pathogens affect clinical outcomes and disease characteristics, during vancomycin therapy. It is
supported by clinical reflective in vitro and animas models of CDI. In the second goal, the strains will be
genetically characterized to delineate genetic variations that promote treatment failures in patients. These
genetic signatures will be molecularly validated in the lab and used in population-based analyses of public
genomes to understand global patterns of resistance among patient isolates. Lastly, given there are few
treatment options for CDI, other antibiotic strategies will be investigated to provide additional coverage of
organisms prone to vancomycin to fail. The outcome of this research will be delineation of genetic variations that
evolve in C. difficile that cause therapeutic failure. This will lay the foundation for molecular and genomic
diagnostics to rapidly detect these strains to improve prescribing approaches for CDI patients. Public health.
This study has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of CDI, a disease that imposes a major
public health and economic burden in the United States.

 Infections by the motile bacterial species, Helicobacter pylori, are promoted by
chemotaxis, which refers to the ability to migrate towards favorable chemical environments. H.
pylori infections are a major cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancers. Yet, the biophysical
mechanisms of chemotaxis in H. pylori are not understood. In the canonical chemotaxis network,
chemoreceptors sense extracellular ligands and regulate the activity of a chemotaxis kinase. The
kinase in turn modulates flagellar functions to bias bacterial migration. To prevent the network
from desensitizing upon ligand-detection, two enzymes, CheR and CheB, continuously reset the
kinase activity. Such resetting (adaptation) increases the dynamic range of ligand sensing in the
network, without which the cell cannot continue migrating up or down chemical gradients.
However, H. pylori lack CheR and CheB homologues. Also, the pattern of motility in H. pylori is
different from the standard model, Escherichia coli, since H. pylori localize all their flagella at a
single pole – individual cells swim forward (run) and backward (reverse), rather than running and
tumbling as E. coli do. This subtle difference in motility is predicted to give rise to multiple
chemotaxis errors in the canonical framework. Hence, current mechanistic models of chemotaxis
are unable to explain biased and error-free migration in H. pylori. Without a fundamental
understanding of chemotaxis in H. pylori, the development of antibacterials that target chemotaxis
will likely remain limited. In the proposed work, the PI’s primary goal is to explain how the
chemotaxis network modulates flagellar functions to promote chemotaxis in H. pylori. The PI’s
long term goal is to use the insights from the proposed work to develop innovative methods to
prevent H. pylori infections by inhibiting chemotaxis. The PI will make use of a novel technique
that overcomes the status quo by allowing quantification of flagellar functions without probing
individual flagellar motors. Through a combination of optical tweezers, phase microscopy, and
stochastic modeling, the PI will determine how chemotaxis errors are prevented at a single cell
and population level in H. pylori. The team will pioneer the development of novel assays, including
a FRET assay, to experimentally measure chemotaxis signaling in H. pylori. The PI will also
determine the role of key coupling proteins that have been hypothesized to play a major role in
chemotaxis adaptation. In addition to establishing the biophysical principles of chemotaxis in H.
pylori, the following payoffs are anticipated: 1) a paradigm will be established for understanding
chemotaxis migration in other run-reversing species, 2) novel mechanisms of chemotaxis
adaptation are likely to be elucidated, 3. a FRET-based assay will be developed, which will
significantly boost current efforts in the field to understand chemoreceptor functions and
chemotaxis signaling mechanisms in H. pylori. Successful execution of the projects will enable a
major advance since chemotaxis strategies remain poorly understood in a large majority of
bacterial species."

Ribosome rescue pathways are conserved throughout bacteria, but the reason these pathways are important for

pathways and to target these pathways for new antibiotics. The overall objective of the proposed project is to
identify interactions among components of the translation machinery that are specifically required for ribosome
rescue and under what conditions different ribosome rescue systems are required. The central hypothesis of this
work is that specific interactions within the ribosome and between the ribosome and other translation factors
are uniquely required for ribosome rescue and that alternative rescue systems are critical under environmental
conditions that cause RNA damage. The rationale for pursuing the proposed research is that it will determine
why ribosome rescue is conserved in bacteria and will enable development of new antibiotics. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) identify the molecular interactions required
for trans-translation, 2) determine how ArfT rescues ribosomes in conjunction with either RF1 or RF2, and 3)
determine why alternative ribosome rescue systems are required. Published work and preliminary data have
identified small molecule inhibitors of trans-translation, and work in the first funded period of this grant

these targets are important for trans-translation and how the targets are disrupted by inhibitor binding. We will
used structural and biochemical experiments in Aim 2 to determine the mechanism of a new alternative ribosome

conditions where the alternative ribosome rescue factor ArfB is required in Caulobacter crescentus, even when
trans-translation is functional. We will determine the molecular basis for the ArfB requirement and determine
of other alternative ribosome rescue factors are required under similar challenges in other bacteria. The use of

11092599,"Risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) onset dramatically increases during adolescence, particularly for girls.
There is a vital need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of MDD risk to improve early risk detection and
targeted preventions. The stress generation model posits interpersonal stress generation (I-StressGen) as a
mechanism of risk and proposes that youth with preexisting MDD vulnerabilities actively contribute to the
occurrence of interpersonal stressful life events in their lives (i.e., I-StressGen), which in turn exacerbates their
risk for MDD. Although the impact of I-StressGen on prospective MDD risk in adolescents is well-established,
the precise mechanisms contributing to I-StressGen remain unclear. Self-report research indicates increased
affective reactivity during negative social interactions as a promising mechanism contributing to I-StressGen,
though this has not been directly tested. The underlying neural mechanisms of I-StressGen also remain
unexamined, despite work suggesting that greater social stress is associated with aberrant activation in
corticolimbic regions during tasks probing response to negative social interactions. Therefore, the overarching
goal of the proposed study is to obtain a fine-grained, mechanistic understanding of the role of brain and
behavioral affective reactivity during negative social interactions as it relates to I-StressGen and subsequent
MDD risk in female adolescents. The proposed study will enroll a risk-enhanced sample of 90 female adolescents
(ages 13-15) and will utilize neuroimaging (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine brain
and behavior indices of socio-affective reactivity as predictors of I-StressGen and depression symptoms across
a multi-wave one year follow-up. In doing so, the current study will test whether affective reactivity during negative
social interactions at the neural (Aim 1) and real-world behavioral (Aim 2) level prospectively predicts I-
StressGen, and whether I-StressGen mediates the relation between this socio-affective reactivity and
prospective increases in female adolescents’ depression symptoms (Aim 3). The proposed study and parallel
training plan will allow the Candidate to build upon her current expertise in adolescent stress and MDD risk and
develop new skills in four key areas: (1) fMRI, (2) EMA, (3) advanced statistical multilevel modeling, and (4)
professional development. The rich academic environment at the University of Illinois at Chicago coupled with
the collective expertise of the Candidate’s mentorship team in fMRI methodology, developmental affective
neuroscience, EMA, and advanced statistical techniques will facilitate successful implementation of the proposed
study and training plan. The acquisition of these skills will be integral to launching the Candidate’s independent
career as a translational scientist focused on delineating brain-behavioral mechanisms of adolescent MDD risk
within the context of real-world interpersonal stress. Results from this study will inform the development of future
grants focused on characterizing socio-affective brain and behavior mechanisms and aberrant developmental
trajectories contributing to the emergence of maladaptive stress processes and MDD onset in adolescence."

 Students in marginalized communities who ‘strive’ to rise above adversity to achieve academic success
are considered ‘resilient’. However, youths’ resilience in one domain (i.e. academic) can come at a cost in
other domains including physical and mental health morbidities that are under-identified and under-treated.
Previous research suggests that Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) who exhibit a “striving
persistent behavioral style” in the face of adversity evince later health morbidities. Ironically, the same self-
regulatory skills that promote academic achievement amid chronic stress can also result in physiological
dysregulation that harms health and mental health1–3. Self-regulatory processes that involve emotion
suppression, experiential avoidance, and unmodulated perseverance can culminate in allostatic load which
fuels health disparities1,4 and internalizing symptoms of depression and anxiety5.
 The proposed mechanistic trial will utilize mindfulness training to permit examination of questions about
the causal role of emotion regulation strategies linked to the striving persistent behavioral style in driving
mental health and health morbidities among BIPOC78. The proposed Project STRIVE (STudents RIsing
aboVE) will identify BIPOC students who are academically resilient in the face of disadvantage and will offer a
tailored mindfulness intervention targeting self-regulation processes as a putative mechanism to interrupt the
links between the striving persistent behavioral style and negative health outcomes. We propose a multisite
randomized trial randomizing 504 high achieving, socioeconomically disadvantaged Black, Latinx and Asian
American students in 18 schools to receive a mindfulness intervention or an attention control condition focused
on study skills. The study will: (1) test the effects of the STRIVE intervention on putative self-regulation

the effects of the STRIVE intervention on health and mental health outcomes at 12-month post-treatment,
including biomarkers of allostatic load (cortisol, blood pressure, body-mass-index, waist/hip/neck
circumference), health complaints, and internalizing symptoms, and (3) examine the mechanistic model linking
striving persistent behavioral style and health outcomes within the STRIVE trial. If successful, this trial will

Preschool anxiety, while prevalent and impairing, is an imperfect predictor of future outcomes. For example,
longitudinal data suggest that anxiety disorders in preschool predict not just future anxiety but also other
internalizing disorders and comorbid disruptive behavior in adolescence. Similarly, early adversity increases
risk for many forms of adolescent psychopathology. Using our current methods we cannot identify which
preschool children will go on to acquire which disorders in adolescence. This is in part because most models
focus primarily on continuity within diagnoses as opposed to transdiagnostic risk factors and in the case of
adversity, on the number rather than character of adverse childhood experiences. The current proposal tests a
novel conceptual model focused on the type of adverse exposure, which differentiates two primary dimensions
of experience underlying multiple forms of adversity: deprivation and threat. Interpersonal violence or threat
and decreased cognitive and social inputs or deprivation are differentiated by the kind of experiences children
have and by the impact of those experiences on neural and cognitive function. Thus, this model of adversity
allows a focus on transdiagnostic risk factors. Importantly, the neural pathways linked to deprivation and threat
are the same neural circuits known to be disrupted in early anxiety disorders. Given this shared neural risk we
expect that early adversity and anxiety will interact to increase risk for psychopathology in adolescence. We
also expect further moderation by other preschool diagnoses (e.g., ODD, ADHD). These neural pathways may
be the ‘missing link’ between preschool anxiety and adolescent psychopathology. To address this knowledge
gap, we propose following a group of adolescents (now aged 15-17 years; N=502) who were first assessed in
preschool (ages 2–5 years). A subsample of these children (N=93) underwent structural and functional imaging
up to 3 times between 5-10 years of age. This innovative, cost-effective proposal will provide an unparalleled
opportunity to answer central questions about the trajectory of neurodevelopmental processes linking early risk
to specific forms of adolescent psychopathology in a highly vulnerable population. The proposed research
directly addresses Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH strategic plan."

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a form of skin cancer, originating from keratinocytes, that kills an
estimated 8000 people per year in the United States. Compared to other cancers with similar incidences, death
tolls, and/or economic burdens, our understanding of the genomic landscape and genetic evolution of
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is limited. The overarching goals of this grant are to define the driver
mutations in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, to delineate the genetic evolution of cutaneous squamous
cell carcinomas from precursor lesions, and to establish the earliest genetic alterations occurring in pre-
neoplastic keratinocytes. Towards these goals, in aim1, we will identify driver mutations in exome and genome
sequencing data covering cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This data will be aggregated from publicly
available sources as well as new sequencing data from our own institution, collectively comprising the largest
analysis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma sequencing data to date. In aim2, we will sequence cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas and the remnant precursor lesions from which they arose. Most cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas are discovered adjacent to benign precursor lesions known as actinic keratoses,
and here, we will analyze patient-matched lesions to reveal the mutations driving the transition from the benign
to the malignant state. In aim3, we will elucidate the earliest somatic alterations occurring in individual
keratinocytes from normal skin. Deep sequencing of normal skin has shown that keratinocytes can form
patches of related cells, sometimes harboring mutations known to drive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma,
but no studies have truly genotyped keratinocytes at single-cell resolution, leaving gaps in our knowledge of
the incipient events that occur in pre-neoplastic keratinocytes. We have developed an innovative workflow to
call mutations in individual skin cells with high specificity and sensitivity, permitting us to catalog, for the first
time, the genomic alterations in human skin at single-cell resolution.
Similar lines of genomic studies have proven fundamental in advancing our understanding of other cancers by
revealing therapeutic points of intervention, biomarkers to measure disease progression, biomarkers to
estimate disease likelihood, and guidance on the best prevention tactics. Here, we will address these gaps in
knowledge for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Taken together, completion of these studies will realize
longstanding goals within the field of dermatology, which will pave the way for new treatment strategies and
new preventions strategies to alleviate the public health burden posed by cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma."
11062921,"ABSTRACT
Malignant phyllodes tumors (MPT) are extremely rare primary breast cancers, which are globally understudied
due the infrequency of the diagnosis and to the unfamiliarity with the aggressiveness of their biologic behavior.
Because benign phyllodes tumors are much more common and have a very indolent course, MPT are often
underappreciated. There are few reliable predictive markers for outcomes and unfortunately local recurrence
(LR) and/or distant metastases occurs frequently for MPT (20%). Treatment is almost exclusively surgical;
there is no systemic therapy outside of the metastatic setting. With no known effective chemotherapy and no
approved targeted therapy options, metastatic progression, which occurs frequently, portends a dismal
prognosis. Median survival for these young women (median age of 45) is just 7-15 months.
This study will define clinically actionable opportunities for this rare, but frequently fatal, tumor, in a population
currently not provided access to potential life-saving therapies due to severely limited data. This study
specifically aims to define potentially targetable and actionable opportunities and to improve the ability to
predict outcomes (both phenotypically and genotypically). The results may be immediately impactful by
allowing known FDA-approved therapies to be offered to those known to be at highest risk.
Our first aim is to define the repertoire of genomic alterations in borderline PT (BLPT) and MPT and to evaluate
these for associations with clinical outcomes. This study will be conducted as an archival project (utilizing
stored tissue blocks) and will include 100 MPT and 50 BLPT cases, with at least 25 cases having known LR
and/or metastatic disease. Our second aim is to assess the reclassification and outcomes of phyllodes tumors
applying the newly released College of American Pathologists (CAP) Phyllodes Cancer Protocol Template and
to develop a predictive model and nomogram. Utilizing all available cases of BLPT and MPTs previously
included in our group's US multi-center phyllodes tumor series (N=550), we will perform a centralized
histopathologic re-review, based on digitized whole slide imaging and classification according to the new CAP
reporting protocol.
Without an accurate and reliable predictive model for LR and/or metastatic disease, we remain unable to
stratify women for interventions. Our group's ability to perform molecular sequencing on a large number of
BLPT and MPT will not only help define who is at risk, but who may immediately be eligible for systemic
therapies, not currently available to women at high risk for an unforgiving clinical course."

Non-infectious uveitis is comprised of a heterogeneous group of clinically-defined diseases for which empiric
therapy fails many patients. Molecular characterization of uveitis, on the other hand, would result in more
precise classification of disease subtypes, while simultaneously providing pathophysiologic insight with
therapeutic potential. This could spare patients unnecessary toxic side effects or loss of vision due to
therapeutic inefficacy. Consequently, there is a critical need to better classify uveitis subtypes in order to
discover more effective strategies for targeted immune suppression. The long-term goal is to develop a
platform for molecular characterization of uveitis that will eventually facilitate precision medicine treatment
strategies. The approach is to utilize validated experimental techniques to explore novel observations obtained
from single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq), a high-definition gene expression analysis of ocular immune
cells. Specifically, the central hypothesis for this proposal, that type 1 conventional dendritic cells (DC1s)
promote the resolution of ocular inflammation, is based on primary observations of human ocular DC1s
obtained via scRNA-Seq. The overall objectives of this proposal are to a) ascertain the role of DC1s in ocular
inflammation, and b) to determine how patient-specific alterations in DC1s contribute to the chronicity of
uveitis. Toward these ends, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Test the hypothesis that the ocular
microenvironment promotes pro-resolution DC1s. 2) Test the hypothesis that DC1s promote the resolution of
ocular inflammation. 3) Test the hypothesis that patient-specific DC1 gene expression signatures predict
uveitis chronicity. In aim 1, the effect of the ocular microenvironment on DC1s will be tested by a) analyzing
aqueous-exposed human DC1s in vitro and b) analyzing murine DC1s in 2 distinct models of ocular
inflammation in vivo. In aim 2, the specific effects of DC1s on disease chronicity during ocular inflammation will
be explored using mice deficient in DC1s. Finally, in aim 3, the transcriptional signatures that best predict
chronic and acute uveitis will be validated and used to a) identify peripheral blood biomarkers and b) identify
potential therapeutic targets. This contribution will be significant because it will improve our ability to define
uveitis entities based on pathophysiologic mechanisms that can then be appropriately targeted by precision
application of immune therapies. This proposal is innovative in the use of scRNA-Seq to generate testable
hypotheses from in-depth analysis of patient samples. Ultimately, improved molecular characterization of
uveitis based on identification and validation of differential gene expression provides a scaffold for future
analyses that will facilitate a precision medicine approach to immune therapy."
11085052,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted care delivery that limited access to providers,
acute and timely non-acute evaluation, and clinical intervention. Dialysis patients with kidney failure are
particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality because they commonly
have multiple chronic conditions, typically require thrice weekly life-sustaining dialysis treatment in close-
quartered clinic settings, are already prone to fragmented care, and especially susceptible to disrupted care. The
COVID-19 pandemic presents fundamental threats to dialysis patients, and there is an urgent need to examine
the impact of disrupted care for this vulnerable and uniquely healthcare reliant population of patients.
 Over 16,000 of enrolled Veterans receive chronic dialysis through Veterans Health Administration (VA)
Kidney Program’s VA and VA Community Care providers. VA Community Care improves access to life-
sustaining dialysis services for 80% of Veterans with kidney failure with limited access to the VHA’s 70 dialysis
units. In prior work, we found lower 2-year mortality among Veterans receiving dialysis exclusively in VA
compared to those receiving dialysis in non-VA settings, consistent with VA and non-VA comparative studies in
other clinical contexts. These differences may be due to more comprehensive integrated services (e.g., co-
located primary and tertiary care services, care management, social work, national electronic medical record) in
VA, compared with the more fragmented and siloed dialysis care in private sector community settings.
Significance: Pandemic-related disruptions may disproportionately affect Veterans with serious conditions and
social risk factors like those with kidney failure and the nature and impact of pandemic-related disruptions may
differ in VA and non-VA systems. However, rigorous comparisons of COVID-related care disruptions and
outcomes between Veterans receiving healthcare in VA and non-VA settings are lacking.
Specific Aims: Building on our team’s research expertise, this study will:
1) Quantify the impact of COVID-19 on 1a) disrupted care for prevalent patients and 1b) deferred care for incident
 patients in a national cohort of Veterans with ESKD and compare the extent of these impacts between VA-
 financed dialysis care in VA and VA Community Care settings from 2018-2022.
2) Compare patient-level outcomes and racial and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes in VA and non-VA
 dialysis settings before and during the COVID pandemic time periods.
Methodology: We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study of all VA-enrolled patients with end-stage kidney
disease receiving VA-financed dialysis care between 2018 and 2022, to observe care patterns before the pre-
COVID phase (Jan 2018-Feb 2020), the acute COVID phase defined as the first case of COVID until
authorization of the vaccine (Mar 2020-Dec 2020) and the recovery phase when COVID-19 vaccination was
available (Jan 2021-Dec 2022). Study data will be derived from linkages of VA and Medicare administrative data
with community-level national COVID-19 tracking and neighborhood socioeconomic status data to assess the
impacts of pandemic-related disruptions in care on disparities in outcomes among Veterans receiving dialysis in
VA and non-VA settings.
Next Steps/Implementation: This research is directly responsive to the COVID RFA HX-21-025: Pandemic
related disrupted and deferred care and three VA HSR&D priority areas (Access to Care, Complex Disease
Management, Social Determinants of Health). The study team is conducting this work partnership with the VHA
National Program for Kidney Disease to ensure that our work is poised to shape evolving VA policy around
provision of community care and to improve care for Veterans during the COVID-19 pandemic, recovery, and
future public health crises. Results will inform how VA manages its Veterans in disaster scenarios, particularly
with provider partners in VA community care, for whom the VA relies on for reliable and accessible dialysis care."
11072244,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Over 80% of adolescents with an alcohol use disorder (AUD) who
present to treatment have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis. Although the best available treatments for
adolescents with alcohol use disorders and co-occurring disorders (AUD+CODs) yield only modest short-term
benefits, parent-involved treatments result in the best outcomes. In line with NIAAA’s strategic plan to improve
treatments for AUD+CODs, this application seeks to address a central, yet unanswered question – what
parenting behaviors during parent-involved treatment for AUD+CODs contribute to improved outcomes?
Parenting is dynamic and varies from moment to moment depending on context, affect, and adolescent
behavior. Moreover, treatment motivation, alcohol craving, alcohol and cannabis use, and internalizing and
externalizing symptoms — core adolescent AUD+CODs treatment targets — vary considerably within and
across days. Understanding the parenting behaviors during treatment that account for improved treatment
outcomes requires momentary assessments that can capture the dynamic nature of parenting and core
adolescent treatment targets. This K99/R00 study intends to leverage an experimental medicine framework to
study how parenting, captured in real time in daily life, impacts core treatment targets (treatment motivation,
alcohol craving, alcohol, and cannabis use, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms) among adolescents
enrolled in an intensive outpatient for AUD+CODs. The specific aims for the K99 are to adapt parental
communication, general parenting practices, and alcohol-specific parenting measures to EMA (Aim 1), conduct
a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the EMA protocol (N=20 parent-adolescent dyads; Aim 2a), and use
mixed methods to evaluate and refine the EMA parenting measures and protocol (Aim 2b). Dr. Samuel
Meisel’s overarching training goals are to (1) refine skills in independently designing, developing, and
executing EMA research (Drs. Robert Miranda and Elizabeth McQuaid), (2) solidify expertise in conducting
treatment research with adolescents with AUD+CODs (Drs. Aaron Hogue and Robert Miranda), (3) apply
experimental medicine methods to adolescent AUD+COD treatment mechanisms research (Dr. John Kelly),
and (4) promote a successful transition to independent faculty researcher. These training objectives build on
Dr. Meisel’s F32 (AA028414), which provided him with the foundational training to broaden his research from
studying the initiation and escalation of adolescent alcohol use to adolescent alcohol use treatment and
mechanisms of behavior change. R00 specific aims include examining momentary parenting-core treatment
target associations (N=75 parent-adolescent dyads; Aim 3a) and examining changes in the strength of
parenting-treatment target associations over the course of AUD+COD treatment (Aim 3b). Findings will
systematically identify the specific parenting practices during AUD+CODs treatment that most strongly relate to
core treatment targets and will serve as preliminary data for future R01 and R34 applications."
11059616,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease of aging and as such it
associates with a rapidly growing socioeconomic burden. A hallmark of PD is the loss of dopaminergic (DA)
neurons in the substantia nigra, which is causally linked to the debilitating motor symptoms that characterize
this disease. However, motor function is not confined to the substantia nigra –other brain structures, like the
primary motor cortex (M1) that controls specific sets of motor skills, are affected in PD. Until recently, the
abnormal activity of M1 neurons observed in PD was thought to be a direct consequence of an increased basal
ganglia inhibition due to the loss of nigral DA neurons. There is now strong evidence indicating that M1 circuitry
exhibits adaptive changes in response to loss of DA neurons. Our preliminary data show numerous intrinsic
and synaptic adaptations in M1 circuitry. Yet, we lack fundamental understanding of M1 circuitry dysfunction
in PD in the context of its neuronal heterogeneity and synaptic complexity. Moreover, compelling evidence
shows M1 dysfunction occurs early in PD, but it remains unclear whether it is adaptative or maladaptive as the
disease progresses.
 In the proposed research, we will systematically study how the loss of nigral DA neurons induces
adaptative changes in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal neuron subtypes in the layer 5 of M1. We will also
determine molecular and ionic mechanisms that associate with these changes (Aim 1). A combination of ex
vivo patch-clamp recording with pharmacological and biophysical approaches will be used to address these
two questions. Moreover, by combining ex vivo patch-clamp recording with optogenetics, chemogenetics, and
connectomics, how the loss of nigral DA neurons alters the connection strength and plasticity of thalamocortical
synapses will be determined (Aim 2). Last, the time course of M1 circuitry dysfunction as neurodegeneration
occurs will be studied using a mouse model that shows progressive loss of nigral DA neurons and levodopa-
responsive motor deficits. In these studies, M1 circuitry dysfunction will be related to the development of motor
deficits to determine its role in the onset and progression of motor dysfunction (Aim 3).
 The information arising from the proposed research will fill the gap in knowledge regarding M1 circuitry
dysfunction associated with the loss of nigral DA neurons. This knowledge will aid the identification of novel
physiological biomarkers for PD progression and the design of noninvasive approaches targeting M1 for
treatment of motor dysfunction in PD."
11060153,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the mechanism by which calreticulin (CALR) mutations cause myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) has
been elucidated, there is currently a fundamental gap in translating this knowledge into innovative therapeutic
strategies. The long-term goal is to advance the treatment of CALR-mutant MPN, in particular to develop new
therapies with disease-modifying activity and curative potential. The overall objective in this application is to
exploit the insights we have gained from understanding the altered biochemical properties and unique molecular
dependencies of mutant CALR-driven MPN, to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities, including in the context
of CALR/ASXL1 co-mutation. The central hypothesis is that CALR-mutant hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)
have unique properties, which arise as a consequence of the mechanism of oncogenicity of mutant CALR, which
we have previously elucidated. The specific properties, which we hypothesize that CALR-mutant HSC possess,
include altered protein homeostasis and a differential dependency on key cellular pathways (e.g. N-glycosylation
and protein secretion) for survival. We further hypothesize that co-operating genetic events (e.g. concomitant
ASXL1 mutation) alter the chromatin state of CALR-mutant HSC to drive disease progression in MPN. The
rationale for the proposed research is that, once we develop novel therapeutic strategies to target the unique
properties of CALR-mutant HSC, we will be able to preferentially target CALR-mutant MPN cells in patients. This
has the potential to alter the natural history of CALR-mutant MPN, including in the context of ASXL1 co-mutation,
which confers a negative prognostic impact on CALR-mutant MPN. Guided by strong preliminary data, the
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine protein homeostasis and sensitivity to
proteasome inhibition in Calr-mutant HSC; 2) Determine the molecular vulnerabilities of mutant CALR-driven
MPN; and 3) Determine the impact of mutant Asxl1 on Calr-mutant MPN in vivo. Under the first aim, a mutant
CALR knockin (KI) mouse model that closely recapitulates the features of human CALR-mutant MPN will be
employed to measure protein synthesis and proteasome activity in Calr-mutant HSC and to determine if Calr-
mutant HSC are differentially sensitive to in vivo proteasome inhibition. Under the second aim, key cellular
pathways we have found to be uniquely required for the survival of mutant CALR-expressing hematopoietic cells
in an in vitro whole genome CRISPR knockout screen, will be inhibited using functional genetic and
pharmacological approaches in mutant CALR KI mice. Under the third aim, the impact of mutant Asxl1 on histone
modifications, chromatin state and the transcriptome of Calr-mutant HSC, will be determined using a mutant
Asxl1 KI mouse. The approach is innovative through the application of novel murine models, in vitro and in vivo
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, chemical screening and mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics.
The proposed research is significant because it will uncover novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in CALR-mutant
MPN. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to be transformative in the treatment of this disease."

Differences in cognitive information processing of threat information have been linked with almost every
major psychiatric illness, from anxiety to psychosis to PTSD. And yet, objective, performance-based
measures of such threat sensitivity tend to be (1) unreliable, (2) difficult to scale, and (3) designed for
assessing differences in phenotypic traits rather than characteristics that vary over time. Self-reported
experiences linked with threat processing (e.g. anxiety, hypervigilance, fear), on the other hand, tend to
fluctuate over minutes, hours, and days within individuals. The lack of brief, sensitive, reliable, and
repeatable measures of threat sensitivity thus represents a major gap in our ability to understand how
threat sensitivity is related to mental health, between individuals and over time. The overall goal of the
proposed project is to develop and validate a battery of optimized and generalizable measures for
assessing between and within-person differences in threat sensitivity, for use in high throughput or high
frequency assessment designs. The proposed work is organized around three specific aims. Aim 1 is to
identify and optimize a set of 5 reliable candidate measures, based on an initial set of 25. We will select
and develop measures based on an iterative test development approach, using high-throughput
assessment in N = 75,000 participants to identify parameters, stimuli, and administration characteristics
that allow us to meet pre-specified psychometric and validation benchmarks across device types (see
Research Strategy). Measures that achieve these benchmarks will then be carried over to two large-scale
EMA validation studies: (1) a sample recruited from an acute psychiatric care setting at McLean Hospital
(Aim 2, N = 200) and (2) a diverse Bronx-biased community sample (Aim 3, N = 400). Successful
completion of this project will yield a set of high-quality measures that are validated for research using
both high throughput and high frequency assessment study designs (e.g. EMA), particularly research that
seeks to characterize the temporal dynamics of threat processing or state-related differences in cognition
and symptoms. The proposed research is significant because it will (1) address a critical gap in our ability
to objectively measure cognitive information processing of threat in field test settings, and (2) provide
robust tools for tracking changes in threat sensitivity over time. The proposed research is innovative in
that it (a) employs an iterative test development approach that will allow us to rapidly select and optimize
potential test candidates, administered in naturalistic environments, and (b) allows us to capture both
between and within-subject variability as potential avenues for identifying mechanisms that contribute to
mental disorders Our team is uniquely positioned to accomplish these aims, given our expertise in
developing and evaluating mobile cognitive assessments, psychometrics, fear and threat information
processing, and infrastructure for disseminating cognitive measures in large cohorts and nationally."
11063091,"Background: Loneliness—a subjective emotional state characterized by the perception of social isolation—is
a psychosocial factor that is associated with increased mortality, substance use, and is associated with
precipitants of relapse among individuals with substance use disorders (SUD). Importantly, there are effective
interventions that can be used to decrease loneliness; however, these have not been tested on Veterans with
SUD who are lonely.
Significance/Impact: Individuals with SUD have higher prevalence of loneliness and loneliness exacerbates
pain and sleep disturbance, risk factors of relapse. Without effectively intervening on loneliness, Veterans with
SUD will continue to be at high risk of relapse and will maintain problems engaging with social support,
including healthcare providers—factors critical for recovery. Cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) has shown
the strongest effects on loneliness, however, there are no interventions that are specifically designed for
substance using populations who are lonely. Testing CBT for loneliness and SUD (CBT-L/SUD) has the
potential to have a broad impact on addressing a critical, unmet need that commonly affects Veterans with
SUD. Our approach of national recruitment and telehealth delivery of this intervention highlights how this this
study address VHA care priorities including substance use, access to care, and telehealth.
Innovation: There are no studies that have tested a loneliness intervention in Veterans with SUD who are
lonely, which may neglect a broader impact on mental and physical health. This study is ideally situated to
generate new and important knowledge on the association of loneliness and SUD. This study seeks to address
a transdiagnostic factor, which may improve engagement with social support thereby reducing substance use.
An additional innovative aspect of this study is recruitment being conducted outside the VHA. This may
increase access to care among those Veterans who are especially isolated.
Specific Aims: We aim to: (1) refine the CBT-L/SUD manual by conducting a one-arm trial among Veterans
with a SUD who report loneliness (n = 6), (2) randomize participants to receive either CBT-L/SUD (n = 15) or
CBT-SUD (n = 15) to assess feasibility and acceptability among Veterans with a SUD who report loneliness.
Methodology: We will elicit feedback on a draft of the CBT-L/SUD manual then conduct a small single-arm
trial (n = 6) for further refinement. Specifically, SUD treatment providers and Veterans with SUD will provide
feedback on the draft manual, which the research team will integrate to finalize the manual for a small single-
arm trial. This trial will allow us to collect feasibility of treatment delivery, and treatment satisfaction and
acceptability data to further refine the manual. With the refined manual Veterans with SUD reporting loneliness
will be randomized to either CBT-L/SUD (n = 15) or CBT-SUD (n = 15). We will assess: (1) treatment
acceptability, (2) participant adherence to treatment, and (3) therapist fidelity. We will also assess outcome
measure completion percentage, means and standard deviations, and level of correlation of repeated
measurement of primary loneliness outcomes and secondary substance use outcomes.
Implementation/Next Steps: Results from this study will provide critical feasibility and acceptability data to
inform an HSR&D Merit Award application to conduct a fully-powered randomized controlled trial. The
research team will work with the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention and the Substance Use
Disorder office of the National Mental Health Program to identify implementation and dissemination efforts. For
example, we plan to translate findings into applied practice across various settings (e.g., primary care mental
health, rehabilitation treatment programs). Additionally, this intervention may be particularly useful for
behavioral telehealth centers that deliver evidence-based interventions to rural and other Veterans who have
difficulty accessing VHA care."

Neurological injuries and diseases negatively affect quality of life for millions of people in the US. In particular,
damage to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) causes various visual and oculomotor pathologies, including
optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and simultagnosia. Nonhuman primate and human studies have elucidated
how PPC integrates visual and motor information to plan and execute movement decisions. However, much
still remains unknown about how and where PPC represents future decisions and actions. In this
proposal, we will use two complementary techniques, functional ultrasound neuroimaging (fUS) and
electrophysiology, to explore how PPC represents decision and motor variables. These variables include
movement effector, target location, and action desirability. To date, neural recording techniques have sacrificed
spatial and temporal resolution for field of view or vice-versa. Now, fUS is available as an innovative
neuroimaging technique that measures cerebral hemodynamics with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution
(<100 µm; ~100 ms) and a large field of view (several cm) – specifications ideally suited to recording detailed
activity of entire cortical regions in parallel. In addition, we will use electrophysiology, the gold standard for
neuronal recordings, to verify fUS findings at the single-neuron level. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the
anatomical organization of movement location in PPC by recording fUS data as rhesus macaques complete
eye and hand movements to visual targets. This will provide a detailed cortical map of response fields in PPC
according to effector and movement location. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify how and where decision
variables (effort and reward) are encoded in PPC. Like Specific Aim 1, we will record fUS data while animals
perform eye and hand movements, but we will also vary reward and effort by independently changing the liquid
reward amount and required accuracy (i.e. effort) for each movement. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate
the link between cerebral hemodynamics and the underlying neural activity through simultaneous fUS and
broad-band electrophysiology (single-unit, multi-unit, and LFP). We will use these data to 1) validate our fUS
findings and 2) explore interesting patches of activity at the single neuron level. If successful, this contribution
will further validate fUS as a robust and accessible neuroimaging technique for future research and clinical
applications where electrophysiology is difficult to attain and/or scale. Together, these Specific Aims will
elucidate where motor and decision variables are encoded in PPC from the micro-scale (electrophysiology) to
the meso-scale (fUS). By understanding the neuronal circuits influencing visual-motor decisions, we can better
understand visual-motor disorders, e.g. optic ataxia and oculomotor apraxia. This project will be conducted
through the UCLA-Caltech MSTP under the mentorship of Drs. Andersen and Shapiro. The described research
will form the basis of my PhD thesis and instill the skills for me to become an accomplished physician scientist."

Prevention of schizophrenia has primarily focused on adolescents and young adults who are considered to be
at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. These youngsters display subtle clinical symptoms that are similar to
psychosis but not as intense, and therefore considered to still be amenable to early intervention. Initial
prevention efforts used anti-psychotics as the primary preventive agents but these were shown to be largely
ineffective. More recent approaches have focused on the remediation of the cognitive deficits that are readily
apparent and predictive of future illness in CHR adolescents. However, while cognitive remediation has shown
substantial promise for improving cognitive deficits and improving outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, it
has not yet been markedly successful with CHR youth. The proposed study will test an innovative internet-
based remotely-delivered Specific COgnitive REmediation plus Surround (or SCORES) intervention for CHR
adolescents ages 14-20 years old that targets early processing speed deficits as measured at the
neuropsychological level with the processing speed domain from the NIMH-Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) consensus cognitive battery. The proposed
SCORES treatment package is grounded in a theoretical framework, supported by findings from our group and
others, where processing speed deficits contribute to poor social functioning, which in turn leads to an
increased risk for psychosis. We specifically selected cognitive remediation because it directly targets a core
cognitive mechanism, processing speed, which is a rate limiting factor to higher order behaviors and clinical
outcome in CHR adolescents. To overcome past difficulties in applying a cognitive remediation treatment to
CHR teenagers, we have developed a platform to support our targeted processing speed training, which
involves reducing the heterogeneity of the CHR study population (including a reduced age range, narrowed
clinical criteria, and targeting individuals with pre-existing processing deficits). In addition, we have adding a
novel support surround component which is expected to increase enjoyment and promote retention. In the
single-arm R61 phase, a 2-year proof of concept study, 30 CHR individuals will receive SCORES for 10
weeks(4hrs per wk/40 hrs total) with a midpoint assessment at 20 hours (5 weeks) to demonstrate target
engagement and identify the optimal dose of SCORES needed to engage the target. In the R33 phase, a 3
year pilot study, we will replicate target engagement in a new and larger sample of 54 CHR individuals
randomized to SCORES (optimized dose)or to a Video GameControl condition to firmly establish the centrality
of processing speed. In addition, the R33 phase will determine if changes in target engagement are associated
with improved social functioning and decreasing attenuated positive symptoms."

11071174,"Exploring nano-bio interactions for cell-specific targeting in osteoarthritis
In the US, osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease. However, there is still no FDA-approved
disease-modifying therapy for this disease. Nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery of RNA is emerging as a
promising approach for treating OA. However, OA, as a whole joint disease, is marked by the pathological
alterations of multiple joint tissues and cells. Thus, one single treatment may not be able address all these
changes, necessitating tissue and cell-specific targeting. Off-target delivery of therapeutics will not only diminish
the efficiency, but also lead to counter-productive effects. Yet, to date, no NPs have the capacity to achieve cell-
specific targeting in the joint, constituting a critical need for precision NPs that can enable effective OA therapy.
Through variations of size and chemical composition, thousands of NPs can be formulated to have different
affinities to different cell types. Individually testing these NPs to select the best formulation for each cell type is
extremely inefficient. But there has not been an efficient screening method to address the critical need of cell-
specific targeting. We propose a transformative high throughput approach to screen for NPs targeting
specific OA joint cells. We named it JOINTseq, for Joint Nanoparticle Targeting with single cell
RNAseq. Each uniquely formulated NP will be loaded with a matching DNA barcode. A cocktail of them will
constitute a library of NPs for intraarticular injection into the mouse joint. By performing scRNAseq, we will
capture cellular mRNAs of each cell as well as the DNA barcodes of the NPs that enter this cell. As such, specific
NPs that target individual cell types can be identified. In our preliminary study, we have observed clear
preferences of different variations of poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs for several joint cell types in vitro.
When NPs were injected into the mice, their DNA barcodes were readily identified, providing strong feasibility
for barcoding NPs.
Our central hypothesis is that JOINTseq can screen NPs with unique structural and functional properties for
precise, cell-specific delivery of therapeutics in the OA joint environment. To test this hypothesis, we will screen
a library of DNA-barcoded NPs using JOINTseq to identify NPs that can target specific cell types in OA joints.
Next, we will demonstrate the utility of selected NPs to deliver mRNA into mouse OA joints and human OA
tissues in cell-specific manner. Success from this study will lead to a new screening method for identifying NPs
for cell-specific targeting and provide critical insights into the nano-bio interaction at a cellular level. Thus, this
work will enable us to embark on a new era of precision NP design for OA therapy. With the increasing
awareness of heterogeneity in all cell types, this approach will open a new horizon for precision gene therapy at
unprecedented resolution and has a transformative impact on OA therapy."
11076574,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurologic diseases affect as many as one billion people worldwide and are a major cause of disability and
human suffering. Current standard of care imaging (contrast-enhanced MRI) is extremely limited to detect many
neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) has a great potential to
supplement routine clinical MRI for clinical conditions including brain neoplasms, neonatal and pediatric
disorders (hypoxia-ischemia, inherited metabolic diseases, and traumatic brain injury), demyelinating diseases,
and infectious brain lesions. Gadolinium contrast agents have incomplete clearance, and repeated use of
contrast-enhanced imaging has recently received an FDA warning due to brain accumulation. MRSI does not
use contrast material and has no/minimal risk for patients. 3D encoded MRSI methods provide high sensitivity
per unit time and unit volume. Presurgical and radiation treatment planning will greatly benefit from full 3D
information, ideally with isotropic resolution. Echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) based 3D whole-brain
MRSI have been on most scanner platforms, and are probably the most commonly used fast MRSI techniques
to date. The primary limitation of 3D MRSI has been magnetic B0 field inhomogeneity, which broadens lineshapes
and diminishes spectral quality in about 40% of the brain (e.g., mesial temporal lobe, inferior frontal cortex,
medial frontal gyrus, brainstem, and cerebellum). This limits the ability to evaluate critical brain regions such as
mesial temporal lobe (MTL) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which have pivotal roles across neurologic disorders.
Recently, we introduced a radically novel concept called Unified Coil (UNIC), which includes innovative
decoupling methods to bring the distance between separate shim and RF loops to zero millimeters. Both RF and
shim coils are at a close proximity to the target organ for maximized RF SNR and shimming. Physical law implies
that the only effective way to shim local inhomogeneous field (as in MTL/OFC) is by placing size-matched shim
coils which generate opposite high-order field to counteract the inhomogeneous field. Our hypothesis is that
UNIC will dramatically increase brain volume coverage and allow true metabolic evaluation of the entire brain
using 3D MRSI. This will enable broader applications in patient management with various neurological disorders.
The proposed study will prototype the first UNIC head coil (Aim 1), optimize the technique in shimming
performance and hardware complexity (Aim 2), and assess the technique quantitatively in improving brain
coverage of 3D MRSI (Aim 3). Successful completion of this study will largely resolve the longstanding B0
inhomogeneity issue in whole brain. Such coils can be widely used to benefit the entire MRSI community by
advancing B0 shimming technology. It will help catalyze the widespread clinical acceptance of MRSI."

 This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-
CA-24-032. I currently serve as PI/PD for the currently active (year 2 of 5) P01 CA263025 (Prevention of
 Hepatocellular Carcinoma Related to Metabolic Syndrome).
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the fastest growing causes of cancer deaths among Americans. In the
past decade, there has been an epidemic increase in metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD)-related cirrhosis and HCC. MAFLD is estimated to affect 1 billion individuals globally and is projected
to become the leading cause of HCC in the next 2 decades. In the U.S., Hispanics are currently most affected
by both MAFLD and HCC. There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to reduce HCC burden in the
growing MAFLD population. The overall goal of the Program Project is to reduce the burden of HCC-related
mortality through better understanding of contemporary risk factors (e.g., metabolic traits and biomarkers) and
protective factors (e.g., chemoprevention, HCC surveillance) of HCC related to MAFLD. We have established
one of the largest and most characterized multiethnic cohort of persons with MAFLD-related cirrhosis, the Texas
HCC Consortium (THCCC) Cohort. This Administrative Supplement aims to increase the impact of our THCCC
research by adding measurements of multilevel factors. The goal of Project 1 of the parent Program Project is
to identify risk factors and biomarkers associated with HCC risk among cirrhosis patients, such that those at
highest risk can be targeted for prevention and early detection. This Administrative Supplement will increase and
expand the influence of Project 1 by using multilevel factors characterizing genetic ancestries and neighborhood
socioeconomic disadvantage to address important gaps in our understanding of heterogeneity in HCC risk within
Hispanic populations with cirrhosis.
 Our Specific Aims are to: (1) examine the associations between genetic ancestry and HCC risk using
admixture mapping analysis among Hispanic cirrhosis patients with (cases) and without HCC (controls) in the
THCCC cohort; and (2) examine how the joint associations of genetic ancestry and neighborhood socioeconomic
disadvantage affects HCC risk within Hispanic cirrhosis patients. The central hypotheses of this Supplement are
that greater proportion of European ancestry and Indigenous ancestry (representing genetic influences) are
associated with an increased risk of developing HCC, and that HCC risk within Hispanics with cirrhosis will vary
by level of neighborhood disadvantage (representing environmental influences).
 The work proposed is relevant to the parent grant and its original work scope, but will provide important
findings that will drive subsequent investigations and preventive measures to address the heterogeneity in HCC
risk within the Hispanic population in the U.S."
11082050,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The candidate’s career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist studying HIV infection with a
focus on HIV and Aging, and the increased burden of medical co-morbidities and geriatric syndromes in older
adults with HIV (OAH). The candidate has laid the foundation for achieving this goal by gaining clinical
expertise in caring for OAH, participating in research, obtaining a Master’s Degree in Clinical and Translational
Investigation. To achieve her career goal, the candidate will need to expand upon her translational research
skills, including additional biostatistics and research methods training.
A key component of the candidates training will be conducting the proposed research project investigating
novel biomarkers in the field of HIV and aging. Despite effective antiretroviral medications, OAH bear a greater
burden of medical co-morbidities and geriatric syndromes than their HIV-negative peers. Translational
research investigating novel biomarkers of chronic inflammation offers as opportunity for insight to the process
of accelerated/accentuated aging that is observed in OAH. Cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cfmtDNA) is released
from cells undergoing stress and necroptosis-mediated cell death, and in the plasma has the potential to serve
as a mediator and marker of chronic immune activation and dysregulation.
We hypothesize that cfmtDNA will be associated with lower cognitive performance and greater frailty in a
longitudinal study of OAH. Previously, we have studied a cohort of OAH (age 55 and over) at our institution,
and those with cognitive impairment had higher average levels of cfmtDNA in plasma than participants without
cognitive impairment. We propose to leverage this existing study to investigate the following specific aims: To
determine if plasma cfmtDNA is associated with cognition; 2) To determine if cfmtDNA predicts physical
function; and 3) Evaluate the immunostimulatory potential of cfmtDNA from OAH with and without cognitive
decline. Participants from our existing cohort will be invited back for two study visits separated by 18-24
months, each visit will include detailed neurocognitive assessment, physical function measures, and blood and
urine specimen collection. Together, these investigations will shed light on the relationship between cfmtDNA,
immune activation and geriatric-related syndromes in OAH.
This project proposes a five-year, multifaceted training program under the mentorship of Dr. Marshall Glesby
as the primary mentor, as well as Drs. Mary Choi, Lishomwa Ndhlovu, and Eugenia Siegler as co-mentors.
Together with a Scientific Advisory Committee, they will provide the expertise in research design, biomarkers,
immunology and geriatrics that will allow support the success of this project. The completion of the proposed
project will lead to an enhanced understanding of cfmtDNA as a biomarker of geriatric syndromes in OAH, and
a translational research tool to identify OAH at the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. After completion of
this project, the candidate will be poised to submit a competitive R03 and subsequent R01 proposal."

successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global
health 2) Recruitment of diverse U.S. trainees across UC and the UCLA-Charles Drew University partnership;
3) Mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health,
veterinary science, environmental and social sciences) and in research methods; and 4) Leveraging common
resources across the four participating UC campuses (UCGHI, CTSAs and CFARs). UCGHI is committed to

As with other state animal feed programs, ours is not a revenue generating program.
To that end it makes it difficult to have the needed funds appropriated to our program for
improvements in equipment and technology.
This funding opportunity is allowing us to implement and maintain the Animal Feed
Regulatory Program Standards. It also enables us to make significant improvements to
our program with the purchase of new equipment and technologies not only for the
regulatory program but also for our testing laboratory. This opportunity is affording us
the capability to update and, in some cases, replace equipment to improve the
effectiveness of our sample collection, storing, transporting and analytical abilities. It will
also enable us to expand on our laboratory testing and sampling for micros.
Accordingly; we will be able to maintain programmatic improvements for years to come
that will help ensure the safety and integrity of the U.S. animal feed supply.
Our program will utilize specific members of our staff to develop and execute a plan to
establish and become fully implemented in all standards and to maintain the standards.
Concurrently our testing laboratory will be taking all necessary steps fulfilling Standard

We like to think of taste as working relatively simply—a sweet taste is recognized as sweet by virtue of
activating certain cells on the tongue, and that information is used to drive neurons that cause us to eat
more of whatever food is in our mouths. The truth, however, is much more interesting: a taste hits the
tongue, and complex circuits in the brain go into action, passing food-related information back and forth as
the system as a whole decides whether the morsel is palatable enough to swallow. My lab studies this
process by recording from multiple parts of the taste system while active rats are sampling various tastes.
We have observed this decision-making process in action in taste cortex, where neural ensembles report,
in turn, that a taste is on the tongue, that the taste is (say) sugar, and that it (the rat) currently likes the
taste; this last step appears to be one arrived at suddenly, in a moment of insight—the food rolls around in
the rat’s mouth for 0.5-1.5 seconds, and then the decision is made. This process clearly involves and
requires cortex, but it is just as clear that cortex doesn’t work alone. Here, we will do rigorous tests of
where that information in cortex comes from (specifically examining the roles played by amygdala and
hypothalamus), in the process revealing novel systems-level mechanisms of taste processing. As a whole,
this research project has the potential to completely change the way we think about taste, and to usher in
new thinking about perception in general—thinking that makes a great deal more biological sense, given
the complexity of brain circuitry."
11067131,"Project Summary / Abstract
While cognitive impairment is a key domain of alcohol use disorder, the neurocircuit mechanisms underlying this
remain poorly understood. This project invokes the claustrum, a previously unexplored brain region in the context
of alcohol, as a potential component of the circuitry impacted by chronic alcohol exposure. Preliminary data has
revealed that chronic alcohol vapor reduces membrane capacitance and frequency of excitatory synaptic inputs,
electrophysiological signatures of profound alcohol-induced neuronal atrophy in claustrum projection neurons.
This project tests the hypothesis that alcohol-induced cognitive control impairments are mediated by
blunted activity of ACC-projecting claustrum neurons. Building on prior expertise in whole-cell
electrophysiology, this project provides training in detailed neuronal morphology imaging and analysis in aim 1
to determine the impact of chronic alcohol exposure on ACC-projecting claustrum neuron synaptic activity,
intrinsic excitability, and morphology. This aim tests the predictions that, following chronic alcohol exposure,
fluorescently labeled and biocytin-filled ACC-projecting claustrum neurons will exhibit reduced membrane
capacitance and sEPSC frequency as well as dendritic and synaptic atrophy. Further, adding new skills in operant
behavior and fiber photometry, experiments in aim 2 will determine the influence of chronic alcohol exposure on
claustrum-ACC activity during a cognitively demanding behavioral task. This aim tests the prediction that chronic
alcohol vapor exposure blunts claustrum-ACC calcium activity associated with reduced accuracy and increased
impulsivity in an attentional set-shifting task. Finally, aim 3 develops technical skills in chemogenetic circuit
manipulation and the drinking-in-the-dark behavioral paradigm to test if claustrum-ACC activity regulates
inflexible, aversion resistant drinking. This aim tests the prediction that promoting or silencing claustrum-ACC
activity will inhibit or enhance aversion-resistant drinking, respectively, as measured by consumption of alcohol
adulterated with the bitter tastant quinine. Combined, these aims establish a role for the claustrum-ACC circuit
in cognitive impairments associated with alcohol use disorder with translational and therapeutic implications. The
technical expertise obtained is bolstered with conceptual training on claustrum and alcohol in relation to cognitive
control. Exceptional training is ensured by Dr. Mathur, an expert on neurocircuit studies of alcohol-induced
inflexible behaviors, and co-sponsor Dr. Cheer, an expert on neuromodulation and reward decision making in
substance use disorder, who both have stellar training records. Seated within an institution boasting state-of-the-
art facilities and a vibrant neuroscience community, professional development is further emphasized with focused
training in mentorship, teaching, collaboration, publishing, and responsible conduct of research. Complementing
prior expertise in synaptic underpinnings of stress-induced hedonic impairment, this proposal stands as an
excellent training opportunity to develop the investigator into an independent researcher examining circuit
mechanisms underlying impaired cognitive regulation of reward-related behaviors in stress and addiction."
11058913,"ABSTRACT
Food insecurity (FI), defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to
live an active, healthy life due to insufficient money or other resources, affects 17 million (12.8%) of American
households. FI is exacerbated in patients with complex medical conditions, and it is associated with worse health
outcomes and increased healthcare utilization and costs. Strategies to address FI such as home-delivered meals
or food assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and food
banks/pantries/pharmacies may improve healthcare outcomes. However, home-delivered meals are associated
with higher costs due to individualized delivery while food assistance programs have several barriers to
participation. We propose to leverage the strengths of both those approaches in a novel healthcare-community
partnership between cancer centers and food banks called Nutrition OUtReach In Systems of Healthcare
(NOURISH), to directly deliver food to patients in clinic. Patients, caregivers, dietitians, social workers, nurses,
physicians, food bank staff, and community members will work together to determine medically tailored options
for the patient population; food banks will oversee sourcing and preparing bags of food; and healthcare providers
will distribute bags to patients in clinic after their appointments. Because NOURISH does not require patients to
make an extra trip and bags are distributed discreetly to avoid stigma, it increases adoption; because food is
handed out in clinic, it lowers costs. We propose to evaluate NOURISH in a multicenter randomized controlled
trial in FI patients with hematologic malignancies receiving transplant and cellular therapy (TCT). We chose this
population for three reasons: (1) TCT patients are in great need as approximately 75% will relocate to live near
a quaternary cancer center (QCC) for a month or more while receiving TCT, removing them from their normal
sources of support; (2) TCT patients are at high risk for malnutrition and other adverse outcomes, often struggling
with nausea, anorexia, and other side effects that can be exacerbated by FI; (3) TCT may be a model for
sustaining care: while other Food is Medicine initiatives have shown economic benefits, because cost savings
do not flow to healthcare systems, there is little incentive for implementation. In contrast, TCT is among the most
expensive medical procedures, and healthcare systems are typically reimbursed through bundled payments. As
a result, QCCs have an incentive to pursue strategies that may lower costs and improve outcomes. For example,
many TCT patients with FI will receive total parenteral nutrition, at significant cost. NOURISH may prevent
malnutrition and the need for intravenous nutrition through much cheaper food assistance. The success of our
randomized controlled trial will provide a compelling rationale for QCCs to continue to fund food banks in their
communities, providing much-needed financial support to sustain these partnerships while improving access and
outcomes for patients. Furthermore, positive experiences in TCT may lead to the expansion of these healthcare-
community partnerships to the broader cancer population and beyond."
11061658,"More than 30% of the world’s population harbors a chronic parasitic infection that cannot be eliminated with 
current treatments. While chronic infection with Toxoplasma gondii has typically been considered asymptomatic 
growing evidence suggests that the parasite can have long term consequences to human health, including 
increased risk of neurological disorders and muscular dysfunction. The presence of T. gondii cysts within organs 
including the brain, eyes, heart and skeletal muscles likely underpin these pathologies. The long-term goal of 
this work is to identify novel therapeutics to eliminate all the cysts in a chronically infected host. However, very 
little is known about T. gondii cysts outside the brain and how they are able survive within these diverse tissues. 
The goal of this project is to better understand how the parasite survives within these tissues and how the host 
responds to their presence to identify a core set of proteins likely essential for survival within all clinically relevant 
tissues. This will allow us to strategically pursue targets able to eliminate cysts throughout the host not just a 
subset. We will use single cell transcriptional profiling of parasites isolated from different tissues and spatial 
transcriptomics of these tissues to achieve this goal. Finally, we will tests a set of proteins known to be important 
for cyst formation in vitro and/or in the brains of mice for their essentiality in cyst development and maintenance 
across all chronically infected tissues. Combined these data will provide (1) valuable, specific, candidates that 
are required for chronic parasite survival and (2) proof of concept for methods to tests the candidates for their 
function in vitro. This will be used to support an R01 grant application to identify specific vulnerabilities of the 
cysts that could be exploited in drug intervention strategies."
11061706,"Overall Project Summary
The proposed U54 program Spatiotemporal Tumor Analytics for Guiding Sequential Targeted-Inhibitor --
Immunotherapy Combinations (ST-Analytics) is designed to develop the recent conceptual advance that
targeted inhibitor + cancer immunotherapy (IT) combination treatments may yield significantly greater patient
benefit if those treatments are administered in sequence rather than simultaneously. Analysis of retrospective
clinical data coupled with in vivo therapeutic modeling using syngeneic models of murine melanoma strongly
support this concept. In fact, the picture that has emerged in melanoma is that immune factors can play a strong
role in driving resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy, and that lead-in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
can ‘prime’ both the primary tumor and distal metastases (including brain metastases) for eradication when the
IT is subsequently combined with MAPKi. This observation opens the doors for immune based strategies, such
as ICB or adoptive cell therapy (ACT), as sequential combinatorial agents to prevent MAPKi resistance.
However, this concept introduces a number of new variables, including dosing, sequence, and timing. This can
make the design and execution of clinical trials that can yield statistically significant outcomes impractical. This
is the scientific and translational problem we address in the proposed ST-Analytics U54.
The ST-Analytics U54 center is populated by leading scientists at the ISB, the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine,
and Yale, and is comprised of two research projects and two research cores, with each project integrating both
state-of-the-art experimentation and computational work. This structure is further designed to bring together the
scientific, experimental, and computational and administrative resources to develop a data base that captures
the kinetics of lead-in monotherapy tumor priming, and apply that data base to the development of predictive in
silico models that can inform the design of such targeted inhibitor – immunotherapy sequence combinations for
clinical trials. This requires close integration and cycles of iteration between of state-of-the-art experimentation,
leading edge computation, and realistic disease models, continuously calibrated through the analysis of highly
relevant, biopsied patient tumors. The resulting science also provides exciting opportunities for high impact
STEM outreach. We propose to act on those opportunities by leveraging a long-standing systems education
outreach program at ISB that already has impacted K-12 STEM education in all 50 states, and places an
emphasis on those communities that have been historically under-represented in STEM."

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) constitutes a tremendous burden to public health. IPF is a rapidly progressive
lung disease that results from the aberrant accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM) in fibroblasts with
an estimated survival of 3-4 years. Amino acids are required to provide the critical biomass for proliferating
fibroblasts. The varied mechanisms controlling amino acid transport and metabolism represent a key opportunity
for drug development and precision medicine. SLC7A5 (Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 5) mediates the uptake
of essential amino acids primarily leucine and efflux glutamine out of the cell. As leucine is critical for
the activation of mTOR and aberrant mTOR activation is a hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis, collectively our
preliminary findings motivate our novel hypothesis that SLC7A5 promotes myofibroblast differentiation, mTOR
activation, apoptosis and mitophagy resistance and by targeting SLC7A5 which could capable of abrogating
multiple facet of fibroblast activation, may represent a efficacious approach towards developing new therapeutic
strategies to treat fibroproliferative diseases. These questions will be addressed by 3 highly interrelated Specific
Aims. Aim 1. We will define the biological roles, metabolic and molecular mechanism(s) by which SLC7A5
regulate profibrotic TGF-β signaling and whether the induction of apoptosis by inhibiting SLC7A5
“chemosensitize” fibrotic foci. Aim 2. We will elucidate detailed role(s) of SLC7A5 mediated mitochondrial
alteration in controlling fibroblast apoptosis and mitophagy. We will also investigate whether SLC7A5 inhibition
induces mitophagy and inhibits lung fibrosis development in the setting of insufficient mitophagy as seen in IPF.
Aim 3. We will determine the in vivo efficacy of targeting SLC7A5 in a therapeutic model of lung fibrosis and
aging. The completion of these specific aims will provide important mechanistic as well as preclinical information
on the role(s) of SLC7A5 in mediating the fibroproliferative actions of TGF-β and a new therapeutic approach for
the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis."

Black patients with advanced cancer who receive cancer care in outpatient settings have unmet spiritual
needs, receive care isolated from their faith communities, and are more likely to receive overly aggressive,
burdensome, futile, and less hospice, end-of-life (EoL) care than their white counterparts. Outpatient oncology
clinics inadequately address Black patients' spiritual needs and lack input from and integration with patients'
faith communities. These systemic, faith-related micro-social deprivations undermine Black patients' decision-
making and quality of EoL care. We have found that 88% of advanced cancer patients report that religiousness
and/or spirituality (R/S) is important to them, yet most (72%) say their R/S needs were not met by the medical
system. Support of dying patients' R/S needs may especially benefit Black patients who often rely heavily on
religion to cope with cancer. Black patients whose R/S care needs were met by the medical system (e.g., who
met with a healthcare chaplain) were much more likely to receive hospice care (OR=6.62) and much less likely
to receive an aggressive intervention (OR=0.16); strikingly, only 1.2% (vs. 11.2% whose R/S needs were not
met) died in an intensive care unit (ICU). Black patients whose R/S needs were met by their faith communities
were much less likely to receive hospice care (OR=0.17) and much more likely to receive aggressive
interventions (OR=8.03) and to die in an ICU (OR=11.2). Thus, disconnected medical system- and faith
community-provided R/S care appears to pull Black patients in dramatically opposite directions with respect to
EoL care. We here propose to address Black patients' unmet spiritual needs and the disconnect from their faith
communities with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine effects of health-care chaplaincy alone and
with faith community linkages on EoL outcomes of Black patients with advanced cancer. Strategy:
Conduct a 3-arm (1:1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial to evaluate intervention effects on EoL outcomes.
Black outpatients with advanced cancer (N=288) will be randomly assigned to receive spiritual care from a
healthcare chaplain alone (Arm #1), a healthcare chaplain in coordination with a faith community spiritual
care provider (Arm #2), or distant intercessory prayer (Control Arm). Outcomes will be patients' spiritual
wellness at 2 months post-intervention, and ICU and hospice use within one year of baseline. Aim 2: Identify
mechanisms by which healthcare chaplain interventions affect patient EoL outcomes. Hypothesis:
More spiritual wellness, medical trust, and readiness to engage in ACP will mediate intervention effects on
hospice enrollment and ICU admissions. Aim 3: Explore barriers to implementation. Strategy: Qualitative
interviews with trial participants and relevant stakeholders will explore barriers to intervention implementation.
Impact: This study will provide evidence of how integration of health-care chaplaincy into outpatient oncology
clinics and its linkage with faith community spiritual care providers promotes spiritual wellness and results in
higher quality EoL decision-making and care for Black patients with advanced cancer."
11063563,"Project Summary/Abstract: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), which occurs up to 30% of COVID-
19 infections, has emerged as a significant healthcare issue in the US. The mechanisms, diagnostic imaging
tests, and therapies for persistent symptoms caused by PASC remain unknown. The CDC describes PASC
symptoms as difficult to explain and manage due to lack of knowledge and reliable test. This study seeks to
define the mechanism of persistent chest pain caused by PASC and establish an effective cardiac imaging test
for guiding therapy. To minimize the influence of confounders, this project focuses on well-characterized patients
with persistent chest pain, which occurs in about 20% of PASC patients. Endothelial inflammation and injury are
important manifestations of acute COVID-19 infection, which may result in chronic coronary microcirculatory
dysfunction (CMD). Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the ideal “one-stop-shop” imaging test
for PASC patients with persistent chest pain, because it does not involve ionizing radiation (i.e. safe for repetitive
surveillance), is a proven modality for CMD, and uses standard clinical MRI hardware and contrast agents.
Furthermore, it affords a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular abnormalities, including: obstructive
coronary artery disease (coronary magnetic resonance angiography), pulmonary hemodynamics (4D flow),
myocardial inflammation (T2, T1), scar (late gadolinium enhancement), diffuse fibrosis (extracellular volume
fraction [ECV]), and contractile dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], RVEF, strain). Recognizing
the need to account for potential confounders, we have assembled a powerful, comprehensive, CMR protocol
for imaging PASC patients. Our central hypothesis is that CMD is the mechanism for chest pain in a substantial
proportion of symptomatic PASC patients, despite having normal lung function and no history of heart disease
prior to COVID infection. To test our hypothesis, we will conduct a matched case-control study comparing MPRs
between well-characterized PASC patients with persistent chest pain, asymptomatic COVID-19 survivors
matched for sex, age, race/ethnicity, CAD risk factors, vaccine status, and severity of acute COVID illness, and
matched healthy controls. The goals of this study are: (1) to determine whether CMR-derived MPR quantification
is accurate and precise; to determine whether MPR quantification and coronary MRA adds incremental value for
diagnosing CMD; (2) to determine whether MPRs are reduced in PASC patients with chest pain due to symptom
status and/or prior COVID infection; to determine whether MPRs predict chest pain better than other CMR
indices, clinical profiles, and blood biomarkers; (3) to determine whether temporal changes in MPRs differ
between treated and untreated PASC patients; whether temporal changes in MPRs correlate with temporal
changes in angina status. This proposal has high potential impact on PASC patients suffering from chest pain
by identifying and quantifying the mechanism of persistent chest pain, informing future development and
applications of mechanism-directed therapies for CMD, and improving cardiovascular health."

Parent Award PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) was founded in 2010 to create a network of independent
centers focused on measuring human immune responses with high-throughput systems immunology
approaches coupled with detailed clinical phenotyping. We propose to develop a HIPC Coordinating Center
(HCC) that will provide data more rapidly and effectively to the broader scientific community, and also serve
the entire HIPC by increasing the value of the research performed at HIPC Centers. In parallel, the HCC will
serve as a promoter of cross-HIPC collaborations through the organization of multi-center analysis projects
and a centralized Portal to provide a space for the exchange of ideas. Specifically, the HCC will continue the
development of shared data standards, provide a central Knowledgebase of study results, establish tools to
visualize and analyze data, lead synergistic cross-center analysis efforts, provide a Portal to make the tools
and data broadly accessible, and provide administrative support for the activities of HIPC subcommittees and
management of the Infrastructure and Opportunity Fund (IOF) program. Our team has proven experience in
running programs of similar scale and complexity. We also have the necessary familiarity with the HIPC
network, with our team including current PIs of the Data Standards IOF project, the Signatures IOF project,
clinical information capture, and the existing ImmuneSpace data portal. This proposal leverages this combined
experience and infrastructure while, in parallel, implementing various significant and necessary improvements
facilitated by the tighter integration and the 5-year time horizon of this dedicated HCC grant."
11062286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Septic shock is a commonly, costly, and deadly condition. There is increasing recognition that
septic shock patients vary significantly in terms of (1) clinical presentation, (2) response to treatments, and (3)
clinical outcomes. This patient-level heterogeneity may explain why optimal early septic shock management
remains poorly understood. Patients with septic shock are four times more likely to die than septic patients
without shock. Our preliminary data shows that Black patients have higher odds of mortality from septic shock
compared to White patients. Current studies do not characterize patient heterogeneity among septic shock
patients and do not explicate pharmacogenetic factors that may influence disparities in outcomes.
Objective: Insights from synergistic data types are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of
septic shock heterogeneity and hereditable factors that may influence vasopressor response and disparities in
outcomes. The overall objective of the proposed research is to characterize both phenotypic and genetic
aspects of heterogeneity in septic shock. This work is organized into two aims: (1) Identify Septic Shock
Phenotypes Using Advanced Analytic Methods and (2) Quantify Vasopressor Pharmacogenetic
Polymorphisms by Race and Vasopressor Response. Our overall hypothesis is that advanced analytic
methods applied to clinical and genetic data can identify defining features of septic shock heterogeneity that
are relevant to early septic shock management in the Emergency Department and disparities in outcomes.
Methods: (Aim 1) We will use a national dataset of septic patients with hypotension refractory to initial
Emergency Department fluid resuscitation and apply unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to
define clinically relevant phenotypes of early septic shock patients. We will analyze phenotypic variation in
clinical characteristics and outcomes. Then, we will develop a supervised model for phenotype classification.
(Aim 2) We will perform targeted pharmacogenomics of 100 samples balanced for race, 73 of which are part of
an existing research biobank of septic shock patients from our urban, safety-net hospital. We will enroll an
additional 27 patients to complete the sample. We will examine the presence of risk alleles of single nucleotide
polymorphisms for vasopressor-relevant genes by race. We will also examine the association between the
targeted genetic polymorphisms and shock reversal.
Career Development: During the proposed Career Development Award, I will work with my mentorship team
to build the skills necessary to achieve independence as a clinical researcher. Specifically, I will 1) receive
hands-on experience in the design and conduct of translational clinical research studies, 2) take didactic
coursework in data science, biomedical informatics, and implementation science, 3) receive training and
education in translational data science, clinical decision support, pharmacogenomics, and precision public
health, and 4) become a leader and an effective mentor in academic emergency medicine."
11063381,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Fortunately, most individuals with
aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time, which is thought to
depend on neural plasticity. The overall goals of the parent project are to better characterize the neural
correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to investigate which patterns of functional reorganization
are associated with the most favorable language outcomes. These goals are addressed in the context of a
longitudinal study of recovery from aphasia in the first year after stroke. This longitudinal study has generated
an extensive dataset of audiovisual recordings of speech and language evaluations in individuals with aphasia
at multiple timepoints, including connected speech samples. The majority of participants have consented to
sharing these valuable audiovisual recordings, and there are many potential benefits to sharing these data,
including research applications (e.g., different analyses of the data than those we planned) and clinical
education (e.g., the opportunity to listen to and watch individuals recover over time, with concurrent access to
their neuroimaging findings). Yet, there are substantial privacy concerns, because audiovisual recordings
which include voices and faces cannot be deidentified even in principle. In deciding how to balance
considerations about data sharing and patient privacy, it is critical to take into account the perspectives of
people with aphasia and their care partners. Ethical concerns surrounding the sharing of identifiable
audiovisual data, particularly in vulnerable populations such as individuals with aphasia, remain underexplored.
This administrative supplement explores the attitudes of individuals with aphasia and their care partners
towards sharing identifiable audiovisual data. Through thematic analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews,
we aim to identify key themes and factors influencing attitudes towards data sharing in this population. We will
then analyze informed consent processes related to data sharing across multiple labs, and generate
recommendations for the ethical sharing of audiovisual speech and language data from individuals with
aphasia. This is a project specific to bioethics research, which aims to support the development of an evidence
base that may inform future policy directions. By understanding the attitudes of individuals with aphasia and
their care partners towards sharing identifiable audiovisual data, researchers and policymakers can develop
more ethical and inclusive data sharing practices."
11063392,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
On February 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride and butyl
acrylate, derailed in the village of East Palestine, Ohio. Nearly half of the local 4,800 residents were evacuated
within hours. A subsequent controlled combustion of five tankers was undertaken, resulting in the release of
phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the atmosphere. While initial air sampling did not show evidence of vinyl
chloride or hydrogen chloride concentrations above air quality standards, testing is ongoing. Contaminated run
off was detected in two surface water streams. This has had significant ecologic impact — more than 40,000
fish deaths were identified within a 5 mile radius of the site in the days following the derailment. The subacute
and long-term health impacts of this environmental and public health disaster remain unknown. For residents
of East Palestine and the surrounding communities, concern about the long term environmental and health
impacts of these exposures remains high. Due to the multi-pollutant nature of this chemical exposure, and the
potential for pre-existing exposures due to clustering of heavy industry within the area surrounding East
Palestine, a quantitative approach based on biospecimens is crucial to guide subsequent disease surveillance.
While chemical exposure assessment is typically done via interrogation of biospecimens in blood and urine for
specific contaminants, this approach only provides a snapshot of short-term chemical exposure. The somatic
mutation rate (SMR), however, provides a global overview of chemical exposures, as demonstrated by
previous research, and serves as a proxy for environmental chemical exposures. Here, we propose utilizing
SMR to establish a baseline for acute chemical exposure and long-term monitoring with respect to health and
disease risks. Our time-sensitive response, as proposed here, “Healthy Futures Research Study: Linking
somatic mutation rate with baseline exposure in East Palestine”, establishes the baseline impact of a subacute
chemical exposure utilizing a genomic biomarker as a surrogate measure for direct chemical concentration
levels given the mixture of potential contaminants. Our research proposal will i) develop and engage
participatory research in East Palestine and the greater region; ii) utilize a cross-sectional study to assess the
correlation between the SMR, a genomic biomarker, with geographical proximity to the train derailment
epicenter; and iii) elucidate perceived experiences post-disaster with qualitative approaches. This proposal will
establish and develop a shared partnership with community residents, formally organizing a Community
Advisory Board among community members, and providing a baseline biomarker for chemical exposure thus
serving as a baseline for longitudinal studies. Our responsive team is comprised of epidemiologists, community
outreach researchers, and healthcare advocates. Overall, this proposal establishes a cornerstone working with
the community, health departments, and other research institutions across the region to fully comprehend the
short- and long-term health impacts in the East Palestine community."

Our team has developed a machine learning (ML) algorithm that provides highly accurate prognostic
information neurosurgeons can use to advise brain tumor removal. While this algorithm holds great promise
with regard to surgical decision-making and patient outcomes, it also raises significant ethical issues and risk
factors. Proactively identifying relevant ethical issues and exploring possible solutions can improve the
effectiveness, benefits, and uptake of this technology, while also mitigating potential harm to patients and
suboptimal surgical decision-making.
We propose a 12-month bioethics research supplement that will collect original data on stakeholder
perspectives about research and clinical practice involving this novel ML algorithm. Data can inform ethical and
responsible implementation of this technology and will begin to lay the groundwork for developing ethical
solutions and guidance to maximize patient wellbeing and support surgeon decision-making as they balance
patient and caregiver needs, their professional judgment, and ML-generated surgical insights. The research
team has experience in brain mapping, neuroethics, stakeholder engagement, and the responsible conduct of
research and clinical practice. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1. Explore the perspectives of patients (N = 15) with malignant brain tumors about perceived benefits,
drawbacks, concerns, and risk factors in utilizing a ML algorithm for predicting prognosis and surgical decisions
for severe brain tumors.
Aim 2. Explore the perspectives of caregivers of patients (N = 15) with malignant brain tumors about perceived
benefits, drawbacks, concerns, and risk factors in utilizing an ML algorithm for predicting prognosis and
surgical decisions for severe brain tumors.
Aim 3. Explore the perspectives of neurosurgeons (N = 15) who treat patients with malignant brain tumors
about perceived benefits, drawbacks, concerns, and risk factors in utilizing an ML algorithm for predicting
prognosis and surgical decisions for severe brain tumors."

Note: This project is specific to bioethics research.
Existing National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to screen patients for
genetic testing that are based on family history and personal risk factors remain highly inaccurate
with a positive predictive value (PPV) of less than 10%. Emerging AI models based on imaging
data already show great potential to improve the effectiveness of screening patients (with
improved PPV and reduced missed detections). However, the bioethics of AI-driven models and
their implementation in patient care remain unregulated and unexplored. This research will
research the bioethical concerns arising from using black-box AI models for stratifying
newly diagnosed breast cancer patients for genetic mutation and communicating test
results.
NCCN has established guidelines on who is eligible for genetic testing. However, due to the
inconsistent testing guidelines, more than 90% of the one million women in the U.S. who are
estimated to have a BRCA mutation remain undiagnosed. Universal testing has been proposed
as a possible solution. However, it is not economically feasible as it may incur up to $400 billion
to perform genetic testing for all U.S. women, not to mention the lack of genetic testing for low-
income populations--a large portion of population-at-risk. There are already ethical challenges
that surround genetic testing, and without timely intervention, AI might reinforce or even
exacerbate the outcome of patients who are already vulnerable due to existing disparities in the
current healthcare system. To this end, we will focus on the following specific aims: SA1: Analyze
Ethical Guidelines and Concerns with AI in Genetic Screening to assess the ethical concerns
of integrating AI in recommending genetic testing and communicating the results with the patients.
SA2: Managing AI Ethics–Generating Explanations, Minimizing Bias by investigating how
different methods of generating explanations and best practices to minimize bias towards certain
racial/ethnic groups could mitigate the ethical concerns of AI.
Understanding the ethical consequences of AI in genetic screening and steps to mitigating them
will be crucial in enhancing the transparency and trust in emerging healthcare technologies and
guiding future policies toward effectively integrating AI in medical decision-making."

Summary of the data science supplement for Northeastern Illinois University
(NEIU), MSI partner of the U54 ChicagoCHEC
 Chicago's systemically underserved communities have disproportionately high
cancer rates. The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) is a
comprehensive partnership between the two federally designated Hispanic Serving
Institutions, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University
(NEIU), and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern
University (NU-LCC). Dedicated to advancing cancer health equity through rigorous and
innovative science, education, and engagement of Chicago's underserved communities,
ChicagoCHEC relies on a nurturing hub of four Cores (Administrative, Planning and
Evaluation, Research Education, and Outreach) and a research project funding program.
 This data science supplement has a primary focus on developing research,
educational, and outreach activities to increase the capacity in data science at NEIU, the
research-active, Minority Serving Institution (MSI) partner of the ChicagoCHEC initiative.
The proposed research activities in this supplement application complement and enhance
the overall ChicagoCHEC partnership goals. The education activities are centered around
development of new and adapting existing courses in data sciences for undergraduate
and graduate students at NEIU. Outreach activities focus on expanding partnerships with
underserved communities, specifically Chicago Public Schools in the immediate vicinity
of NEIU, and developing education programs using culturally appropriate education tools
about the importance of data science and its benefits.
 As part of the ChicagoCHEC partnership, the goals of this data science
supplement application are centered within NEIU to build research capacity, strengthen
and expand NEIU's partnerships and develop new curriculum by training our faculty adopt
the data science initiative in their research and courses within the framework of cancer
disparities. We intend to achieve these objectives through three main aims including
establishing partnership with Metropolitan Chicago Data-science Corps (MCDC) and
organizing an informative workshop for NEIU faculty to learn and expand on their
expertise in data science resources and tools available to incorporate in courses and their
own research.
ChicagoCHEC will leverage the momentum forged by this data science
supplement to drive innovative cancer research, research education, and community
outreach and engagement that cuts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries."
11086383,"Project Abstract
We propose to conduct research that will determine the impact of relevant behaviors on HIV prevention among
Young Black Sexual Minority Men (YBSMM), such as heavy cannabis use. Data from our group and others
demonstrate heavy cannabis use as prevalent and increasing in YBSMM, is associated with HIV acquisition,
use as a sex-drug, greater likelihood of membership in an HIV transmission cluster, and decreased HIV testing.
We propose to explore mechanisms, specifically neurocognitive impacts of heavy cannabis use, linking heavy
cannabis use to HIV prevention outcomes, and whether motivations for cannabis use, amidst a changing
cannabis regulatory, social acceptance and legal landscape, modify its effects on HIV prevention. In the
proposed study, we will rigorously examine links between heavy cannabis use, neurocognition, sex behavior
and PrEP care engagement. First, we will elucidate the effects of cannabis use on neurocognition –
specifically, brain systems supporting risk/reward (RR) processing, as well as higher order organizational
functions collectively referred to as executive function (EF) in YBSMM. Second, we will explore how cannabis
use, directly and via neurocognitive impacts, is associated with HIV prevention, and particularly PrEP care
engagement (primary outcome). The proposed study will integrate and expand these lines of research within
the context of traditional health department and CDC supported HIV prevention programs that engage YBSMM
in the South Side of Chicago and adjacent suburbs, home to the largest contiguous majority Black population
in the US. We will use rigorous objective measures to assess cannabis use (e.g., quantification of cannabis
metabolites in plasma), neurocognition (e.g., neuroimaging) and PrEP outcomes (e.g., EMR measured
persistence), and triangulate that data using validated survey measures. We will also rigorously account for
other substance use, as a proportion of YBSMM who use cannabis also use other substances (e.g., alcohol),
and there is increasing recognition of the need to study substance use as it occurs in real-world settings,
including polysubstance use. We will assess these factors longitudinally over 1.5 years (3 times 9 months
apart) in a cohort of 280 YBSMM, to permit examination of within-individual biological changes and the
dynamic nature of cannabis use and its association with prevention care outcomes. We aim to: 1) Determine
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cannabis use and neurocognition (i.e., neural response
to risk/reward processing and executive function) in a cohort of YBSMM; 2) Evaluate overall, direct and indirect
(via neurocognition) associations between cannabis use and PrEP care (e.g., persistence [primary]) and HIV
transmission behaviors (e.g., group sex [secondary]); and 3) Determine whether motivations for cannabis use
modify associations between cannabis use and HIV prevention outcomes. Identifying neurocognitive
mechanisms through which cannabis use affects HIV prevention and the importance of motivations for
cannabis use in understanding clinical outcomes will provide targets for future HIV prevention efforts."
11069484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adolescent social media (SM) use is linked to adverse mental health outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety,
suicidal thoughts/behaviors) for some adolescents but not others. Adolescent rates of depression and suicidal
thoughts and behaviors are steadily rising. In 2021, 42% of high school students reported persistent feelings of
depression and hopelessness, and 10% attempted suicide. As SM may contribute to these staggering numbers,
it is crucial to understand what separates positive from negative SM mental health outcomes among adolescent
SM users.
 Emotion regulation is a modifiable factor and widely used clinical intervention target that may amplify or
buffer against negative mental health outcomes resulting from adolescent SM use. For example, if an adolescent
has a negative experience on SM, if they choose an adaptive emotion regulation strategy (e.g., reappraisal),
they may decrease negative mood and ultimately not experience mental health consequences. On the other
hand, if they repeatedly choose maladaptive strategies (e.g., avoidance, rumination), they could amplify their
negative mood, increasing risk for developing mental health concerns (e.g., depression, suicidal
thoughts/behaviors).
 To inform future intervention work targeting emotion regulation to maximize adolescent SM and mental
health outcomes, this NRSA proposes to identify: 1) How adolescents regulate their emotions following negative
SM experiences, 2) Which emotion regulation strategies amplify or buffer against negative mood following a
negative SM experience, and 3) The specificity of these relationships to SM relative to other social contexts.
This study will recruit 50 adolescents (age 14-17; grades 9-12). Participants will complete ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) prompts 3x/day over the course of four weeks to measure 1) negative SM experiences, 2)
emotion regulation strategy selection following each experience, and 3) mood. Passive smartphone sensing will
additionally capture SM use behaviors. This study will build upon and extend the sponsor (Dr. Hamilton)’s K01
study (K01MH121584).
 Using this high-dimensional data, multilevel models will evaluate which emotion regulation strategies
adolescents most commonly use following a negative SM experience, differential effectiveness of these emotion
regulation strategies, and the specificity of these effects to SM relative to in-person social contexts.
The immediate impact of this study will be to identify whether emotion regulation strategies have the potential to
modify mood following a negative SM experience. More broadly, this study will inform clinical interventions
targeting emotion regulation—a core element of many existing evidence-based treatments—to buffer against
possible negative mental health effects of adolescent SM use."

There are currently no effective therapies to reduce vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia
(VCID). The objective of the parent R01 was to build an understanding of the important interaction between
menopause and metabolic health on VCID and identify a novel therapeutic approach to treat VCID in post-
menopausal females. We demonstrated that menopause causes weight gain, glucose intolerance, and
exacerbates cognitive symptoms in VCID. Conversely, using a 17β-estradiol prodrug therapy we were able to
restore cognitive function after menopause. Further, we have preliminary data to suggest reduced endothelial
cell (EC) function in menopause may be a contributing factor to cognitive impairment and that estrogen receptor
signaling has protective effects on brain ECs (in vivo in mice and in vitro in human ECs). Given that over 80% of
individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have underlying VCID pathology that contributes to dementia
progression, the objectives of the current proposal are to define the therapeutic potential of increasing estrogen
signaling in the brain in several dementia models and to identify common underlying cellular mechanisms.
Despite the high clinical prevalence of multiple etiology dementia (MED), very few studies have examined how
AD and VCID interact to produce MED. Our preliminary data show early hippocampal gene changes in AD that
are associated with reduced blood brain barrier function. We also discovered that the brain EC translatome is
altered in both AD and MED models, even prior to the development of cognitive symptoms, suggesting that
targeting brain ECs may be an effective preventative strategy for MED. DHED is a brain-specific 17β-estradiol
prodrug that is inactive in the periphery but gets converted to 17β-estradiol only in the brain and is able to activate
all 3 estrogen receptors. Given that we, and others, have demonstrated numerous protective effects of estradiol
on the cerebral vasculature and we have demonstrated that DHED improves memory after menopause in a
dose-dependent manner, we hypothesize that DHED can be used as a preventative strategy to mitigate the
vascular impact of (peri-)menopause on MED via improving endothelial health. Since pathology is diverse in
MED, we utilize two MED models with different pathologies. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that peri-menopause
induces EC translatome changes and exacerbation of MED pathology that is distinct from changes during
menopause. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that DHED therapy during peri-menopause can reduce underlying
pathology and delay onset of cognitive symptoms in MED. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that DHED improves
EC function in human iPSC-derived ECs, with greater protection in cells from APOE4/4 donors. We anticipate
these studies will provide mechanistic insight that will facilitate future interventions to decrease the burden of
dementia by defining the therapeutic potential of DHED in MED and identify mechanisms by which DHED
provides protection in the presences of multiple vascular risk factors."
10978127,"The Navajo Nation represents the largest Tribal community in the U.S. and experiences high rates of morbidity and mortality attributable to substance use. Rates of alcohol-associated mortality exceed the national rate by more than five times, and specific prevalence rates for substance use disorders (SUDs) such as stimulants and opioids among the Dine (Navajo), while not currently well-defmed, represent a growing concern. Characterizing the burden of SUDs and the responsiveness of healthcare systems to meet that burden within the Dine community is a critical step toward advancing healthcare access, improving healthcare quality, and increasing overall wellness for Dine people. The Utah Navajo Health System is a nonprofit healthcare system in Southeast Utah servicing more than 15,000 patients across seven chapters of the Navajo Nation. As both a Federally Qualified Health Center and Tribal healthcare system, UNHS provides behavioral health care to thousands of Dine patients each year. Over a 23-year period, UNHS has developed a robust composition of behavioral health services, including medication treatment, addiction treatment services, western medicine-based therapy, traditional counseling, sweat lodges, hogans, telepsychiatry, peer support, domestic violence shelters, crisis intervention, and a community wellness program. UNHS' s success has garnered support, collaboration, and partnership from neighboring organizations, including the Navajo Nation, San Juan County Public Health Department, and Navajo Nation. Despite UNHS' s success in clinical care, its ability to assess needs, evaluate performance, and improve care through empirical data and research has been limited. UNHS currently maintains an electronic medical record, data warehouse, and grants manager primarily for operational needs, including data reporting for the Uniform Data System and applying for and processing service grants to support clinical operations. In contrast, UNHS has not previously initiated a research program or applied for NIH
Research funding. Given its unique, influential, and trusted position within the Dine community, UNHS has great potential to be a leader in healthcare evaluation and research-especially for culturally aligned SUD care. UNHS also has a longstanding partnership with the University of Utah that provides an opportunity to develop research by drawing upon the strengths of each organization. Collaboration between UNHS and UU grew out of a shared commitment to serve Tribal communities and represents a close partnership spanning nearly a decade that is focused on improving the lives and wellbeing of the Dine people. As project partners, UNHS and UU will work toward a single overall ob;ective, which is to develop a sustainable, community-led, culturally aligned SUD research infrastructure housed at UNHS that will benefit the Dine community and other Tribal communities by improving healthcare access, quality, and
outcomes. UNHS and UU will achieve requisite preliminary milestones toward that overall objective by (1) conducting a needs assessment among UNHS stakeholders relating to SUD identification, treatment, and research capacity; (2) implementing an SUD research and evaluation program at UNHS, using a model of facilitated implementation; and (3) developing a three-way study cohort of Dine patients with SUDs who (a) receive traditional counseling (b) receive other SUD treatment, and (c) receive no SUD treatment. The aims of the project will be completed in accordance with key guiding principles, including assurance of cultural alignment, a focus on developing inter-organizational and community partnerships, and a plan for
long-term sustainability. As part of the N CREW Program (OTA-23-007), UNHS will build on its history of leadership in Tribal healthcare delivery, unwavering mission to meet the needs of the Dine community, and commitment to partner with organizations who share a similar vision for improving SUD care in Tribal communities.

Integral to all aims of the parent grant (from here on, Human Mammalian Brain Atlas, or HMBA) is a
hospice/palliative care brain donor program which will collect functional imaging data from participants
antemortem to integrate with the whole brain atlas generated postmortem. There are, however, disparities in
access to palliative and hospice care, with people from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds less able to
access these forms of care. These disparities have the potential to disrupt HMBA’s ability to meaningfully include
and positively impact people from minoritized groups. This supplement will support post-baccalaureate
researcher Zoë Hale as they assist in designing and facilitating a series of qualitative interviews with hospice
and palliative care workers working within underrepresented minority groups. This supplement will have two
complementary, primary aims: (1) conduct a comprehensive literature review encompassing ethical, moral, and
societal impact of creating a whole brain atlas on minoritized groups; (2) conduct a qualitative interview project
to engage with the views of hospice and palliative care workers in minoritized groups on the ethical and moral
issues related to brain atlasing. These complementary aims will provide HMBA’s hospice/palliative care brain
donor program on best practices for interacting with and meaningfully including individuals from minoritized

The overall goal of this Supplemental research project is to support the career development of Michelle Karam,
who is a post-baccalaureate research assistant in the Reagan lab planning to go to graduate school in
biomedical science. Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer that results from mutations that
accumulate in the plasma cell. Myeloma cells grow in the rich soil of the bone marrow (BM), first very slowly,
and then more quickly and aggressively, causing degradation of the bone and development of drug resistant
clones. Although therapies exist, novel approaches to myeloma therapy are needed. Our prior work suggested
that myeloma cells can become drug resistant and proliferate faster through support from proteins called fatty
acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). In Specific Aim 1 of our R37 parent award, we are
analyzing how BM adipocytes contribute to myeloma by using novel, three-dimensional (3D), tissue
engineered cancer models. In Specific Aim 2, we use mouse models to study the roles of the FABP members
in MM, as well as the roles of BM adipocytes. The long-term goal of our work is to understand molecules and
mechanisms driving MM growth; this Supplement and Parent project specifically will identify new mediators
driving MM and propose paradigm-shifting concepts to guide the development of new anti-MM therapies.
The proposed studies in this Supplement will not overlap with ongoing work on the Parent award, but will
complement and add translational significance to the findings. We have submitted a Method to Extend
Research in Time (MERIT) Award Extension Request that would extend the R37 grant for two years through
June 2027. This is a two year supplement request with Aim 1 in year one and Aim 2 in year two, if the
extension is granted. Both Supplement Aims will be used to identify translationally significant effects and
mechanisms of FABP inhibitor action on tumor cells and on the tumor immune microenvironment. Our
Supplement Specific Aim 1 is to Test the feasibility for orally-administered FABP inhibitors to slow tumor
progression and increase mouse survival in an immunocompetent in vivo MM model. This will be used
to develop drug delivery doses and oral gavage methods for effectively inhibiting MM growth, which we will use
for the following Aim. Supplement Specific Aim 2 is to: Examine mechanisms of action of FABP inhibitors
in the MM BM environment, including effects on tumor and surrounding tumor microenvironment cells.
This Aim will use novel methodologies and data analyses methods for flow cytometric and spatial
transcriptomic analysis of MM cell growth in the BM of mice, and the effects of FABP inhibitors on the tumor
and non-tumor microenvironment cells. This work should thus illuminate the actions of FABP inhibition not only
on tumor cells, but also on surrounding cells, which will be essential for moving towards the clinic and
thoroughly understanding the potential roles of the FABPs in MM patients."
11063568,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Six million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart rhythm abnormality that contributes to
significant morbidity and mortality. By 2050, the number of Americans with AF is expected to double. AF
accounts for 15% of ischemic strokes, resulting in permanent disability in 60% of cases and death in up to 20%
of cases. Although oral anticoagulation (AC) is effective for AF-related stroke prevention, only 60% of eligible
AF patients use AC. This is particularly true among non-white AF patients, for whom AC use is lower and
stroke rates are higher. Understanding the barriers that contribute to this gap in AC use and adherence is
critical to developing strategies to help decrease AF morbidity and mortality rates in underserved populations.
The proposed Diversity Supplement will allow an outstanding early-career investigator to conduct studies in a
diverse population of individuals over age 65 with AF to examine the barriers to AC use. This work will be a
natural extension of the parent R01 SUPPORT-AF IV: Supporting Use of AC through Provider Prompting
about Oral Anticoagulation Therapy for AF. Now in its third year, SUPPORT-AF IV has already established a
cohort of diverse individuals and their providers from two distinct health systems in Massachusetts and Florida.
The goal of the parent award is to examine the impact of a novel AC clinical decision support tool within the
electronic health record (EHR) on AC prescribing behaviors among healthcare providers and clinician
engagement with the overarching goal of creating an implementation toolkit. Thus, the candidate will have
access to this diverse population to perform vital research while learning essential skills and receiving career
guidance from a supportive mentoring team of experts.
In Aim 1, the candidate will perform telephone surveys to measure the association of health belief variables
(risk perception, trust in providers, beliefs about the effectiveness of AC) + religiosity and spirituality on AC use
in older adults with AF on and off AC and established in care at our participating sites. The candidate will then
perform a subset analysis to measure the differential association of surveyed variables with AC use in African
American and other Black older adults compared with other older adults. For Aim 2, the candidate has
developed a rigorous course schedule and career development plan with her mentor to gain expertise in

In response to RFA-DA-21-116, “Mood Disorders in People Living with HIV: Mechanisms and Pathways”,
we
propose to investigate neuroimmunological and reward functions to study comorbid depression in women living
with HIV (WLWH), a group heavily impacted by depression and its health consequences, yet underrepresented
in HIV research. The proposed research will build upon the established Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study
(MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) (Dr. Sharma, MPI of Bronx
MWCCS) and its unique cohort of phenotypically well-characterized women with and without HIV. Our proposed
model is: (1) HIV infection induces systemic inflammation (cytokines, kynurenines); (2) systemic inflammation
extends to the CNS inducing oxidative stress [↓glutathione (GSH, antioxidant)] and gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA, major inhibitory neurotransmitter) deficits; (3) such neurochemical changes alter the reward circuitry,
which contribute to the high prevalence of depression in WLWH. In support of this model, our immunological
work in the WIHS found increased kynurenine pathway (KP) activity in WLWH compared to women without HIV,
and among WLWH, KP activity was higher in WLWH with depression. In our depression non-HIV research, we
found that anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse
depression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified
distinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic
functional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized
the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during
reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors, which predicted future depression severity. Utilizing proton
MR spectroscopy, we showed that anhedonia accounted for decreased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) GABA
levels in adolescent depression, and moreover, we documented inverse relationships between cortical GSH and
anhedonia severity in depressed adults. Furthermore, we reported associations between circulatory cytokines
and kynurenines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. Extending our compelling findings, we
will now test the overall hypothesis that WLWH exhibit increased systemic and CNS inflammation, which leads
to reward dysfunction and subsequently depression. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed
WLWH; 2) 100 non-depressed WLWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV negative women; and 4) 50 non-depressed HIV-
negative women. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months assessing
depression, reward, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+ count, and VL. F-MRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET), 1H
MRS (GABA, GSH), a reward computerized task and cognitive tests will be done at baseline."
